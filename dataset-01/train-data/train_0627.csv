4,The First Spyro Game!!,"I own all the Spyro games that Play Station has ever made. I would have to say that this game has advanges and disadvanges. Some good things about it is that this is the only Spyro game where you free the dragons. In the rest of the games, you help other people... It is funny and very interesting. ( Sorry, but I won't give the funny parts away. )The disadvanges is that you can't swim. In the other to games you can but in this game, if you touch the water you will die!!Another bad thing is that they don't have the cute characters like the other two games. I would buy Spyro 3 first and then buy Spyro 1. I think Spyro 3 has more stuff to do and has a better story line. I even think Spyro has a better voice. If you like all three Spyro's, try buying the Spyro pack. It is much cheaper than buying all of the games seperatly. Then you can decide which one is better!!"
4,Great Game,"I love this game. The characters are cute, they make great noises, and there are lots of worlds to explore. It's really hard to die too, so you could concievably play without a memory card. What I don't like about it is that Spyro is a little hard to control compared to today's games, and a lot of parts are highly frustrating. Thieves have stolen a bunch of dragon eggs and you have to chase them down and get the eggs back, but this is MUCH easier said than done. I have spent hours chasing these guys on some levels. I mean, I wouldn't want the game to be too easy, but this is borderline ridiculous. But it's still a really great game and I absolutely fell in love with it. I'd recomend it to people who love cute things and have infinite patience."
3,"60% good, $40 'dud'","Okay!As you probably know, this is the first spyro game. Fun, easy... Hey, I beat the game in a few weeks! Yes, the game. I beat it %100 through. The clips they show you are cute, at the very end of the game especially! I would recommend this game to anyone who likes this stuff. It's very easy."
4,Great game!,I love this game! A sort of parallel to Sega's Sonic games and Nintendo's Mario games. It's not too hard and not too easy. It's even stumped me a few times and I play A LOT of videogames! I really recomend it to all ages and especially begining gamers.
3,Simple but good platformer suffers from being dated by its successors,"Spyro the Dragon was something of a mascot back in the very late 90s for Sony, along with Crash Bandicoot. Developed by Insomniac after being acquired by Universal Interactive and the good but poorly sold Disruptor, this first game feels very ambitious in its goals, and, while a very good 3D ""platformer"" for its time, is dated by its vastly superior successors, in that the controls and mechanics are loose and not nearly as tight or improved as they were later on. Insomniac Games was the new kid on the block, and while their first game is dated, it was their first shot at a 3D platformer, and in that way, it's a very well-made game. It's just that you have the other two to play..."
4,HOT!,"Spyro the Dragon was the game I got right after it's sequel: Spyro 2 Ripto's Rage. I know it's a bit too late, but I just think that the Spyro series are too fun. Spyro 2 is better than the first, but this game is still great. The graphics and sound is nice, the gameplay will leave you hours into this game, and the story is original. Spyro is one of my favorite series, and this game is great and fun for everyone."
5,too Expensive,I hardly believe it should be this expensive unless this is a gaming classic that I do own but in not so good of condition
5,Fun!,"I got this game for my 11 year old because I have such fond memories of playing this ""back in the day"". He says that its a great ""exploring"" game. He loves helping the dragons and listening to what they have to say. Spryos tricks are fun yet challenging."
3,Fun but very easy game.,It's a great game but more for kids.The graphics are good but the game's really easy to beat.The levels are really detailed and cool along with the kind-looking enemies.Overall it's good but more for kids who I bet would love it.
2,too easy,i cant beleive how easy this game is. dont get me wrong spyro is a fun game with a decent plot but the game is so easy a 8 year old can beat it. its still a fun and intresting game though youll go trough about 20 levels with good graphics excellent sound and solid activity. all around it is acceptable but it falls short of good. i have to say it is way too easy i only played for 2-3 hours and i was already up to the last boss. if youre really young or dont demand any challenge at all in games this ones for you. but as for you tougher gamers you may wanna select from the next two spyros riptos rage or year of the dragon which are much better games.
2,Spyro was okay......,"Spyro was A fine game in the ways of graphics, but it otherwise falls short in A number of ways: First off, the entire game is redundant. The only new things are fighting bosses. Second, it has no puzzles. All you need to do is find A few statues and your wisked away to the next 'exciting' level. Third, There is no plot to the game, all you do is dart around killing enemys, and even though the enemys varie, they all fall into about three catagories, which I won't waste my time typing. The reason why this game got 2 stars was its size, which i must admit is quite large. Basicly, don't i suggest leaving this one on the shelves."
1,Made me Puke...Literaly!,"This game had graphics that were really bad. The perspective was very frusterating to me because it would change and have funky angles, which made it hard to play at times. It was so bad that this game made me sick...Literally. After probably 5 minutes of playing this game, the perspective and bad graphics made me motion sick! And I am not a person who gets motion sickness! Anyway, even if I could have gotten over my sickness, this game is boring anyway. I found it very unchallenging and redundant.You should definately rent this game first and play it to see if it'll make you sick when you play it. Also, you'll know then if its challenging enough for you."
1,Not that much fun,"Spyro the Dragon is a great game for little kids, but if you are 9 or above, you will hate it. There is almost no point to the game, and it takes forever to get the right amount of coins, or I mean JEWELS. The bosses are so easy its not even a challenge for anybody. If you want a good game, get Resident Evil 3 or Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. But if you are a little kid, I suggest this game."
4,Pretty Fun,"Spyro the Dragon is a pretty fun game but it's really hard. You have to beat a number of different enemies, including these guys who strike you with lightning if you get too close to them and these fat ladies who stand by these big pots and whip you if you get too close to them. You have to find about a million gems that are hidden in all different kinds of containers, which take a few minutes to figure out how to open. Plus, each world has a bonus world and you have to beat the boss of the world, fighting more enemies that have never been seen before, and you have to get even more gems. Also, there are a whole bunch of secret codes that you have to get in order to progress in the game. The worlds are very small and hard to figure out if you haven't played the game before, and it gets really frustrating, especially for younger children. If you are considering buying a Spyro game, I would recommend buying Spyro: Year of the Dragon, because it is much more fun...."
5,A game that makes you feel warm and tingly!,"Hey! Anyone who is looking for a great game that is lotsa fun but challenging, you've got to get Spyro! The wonderful graphics, the oh so adorable dragon, and the funny comments from the frozen dragons will have you laughing and curious to know what the next one will say. It's also a really great way to unwind and use your thinking skills. I've played this game five times, and have still yet to master the flight levels. If you like castles and fairies, I strongly recommend this game for anyone with a fried imagination. Just turn on the game and your in a whole new world! So, give it a try, you just might be surprised..."
5,WONDERFUL GAME!,This game is awsome I have beat it and it is so wonderful Buy this game for your kids! And this is a game that should be game of the year!
3,Only for die hard Trio fans,I love folk music and was a big fan of the Kingston trio but can't say that I love this dvd. It is just ok
3,"2.5 stars rounds up to three, I guess...","I'll preface this by saying I'm a big fan of the Royal Trux. Neil Hagerty and Jen Herrema are bar none the strangest duo I've come across in the last few years.The two albums I've owned previous, Accelerator and Veterans of Disorder, are a convincingly good clashing of many styles: grunge, punk, rock, noise, and a little prog.This album seems to be a mix of Royal Trux vocals with a hair band. Western Exterminator and Balls to Pass are for me the only saving graces of the album. For the rest of the album, the hair metal influence is obviously not done for a comic value. And if it is for comic value, the joke is lost.And where the heck did Hagerty go?"
1,Avoid Seller!,"no case just artwork claires disk is to scratched to play, bottom line you want a good product pay good money."
1,Disappointed,I have been a huge fan of the Resident Evil games since the late 1990s. I have been looking for Resident Evil 2 for a while now and when I saw the price and the condition it was supposed to be in I had to buy it. The game played excellent and there were virtually no scratches on both discs. Disk 2 (Claire) would freeze at a certain point in the game everytime I played it. It would go to a black screen but you could still hear the music. This was the first time I had EVER ordered anything on Amazon and with my luck the game was defect. I was extremely disappointed being such a huge fan of the Resident Evil games and I have already lost my trust in Amazon.
4,fun... but frightning very frightning,this is oniy the benining for Leon and Clare but why do they call Sherry the big one she is not a boss yet you say she is evil she is good on the outside give her a shot she is not evil but in the of resident evil 3 i felt bad for her i hope Leon or Clare find her soon if she is still alive
2,"no, no, no","There's a lot of hype surrounding the Resident Evil series of games. They're on most systems, there are books, and even a movie. The story is a good one, but I found the game to not be so great. Graphics are alright, the sound is bad though. And game play is horrible. Trying to move around is difficult and can be confusing, especially when you're under attack and things are chaotic. The characters move unlike most games. You don't go in the direction of the D-pad, rather you turn with right and left direction and move with a button. It was poorly designed. But since the Playstation 2 is out, and better games as well as more Resident Evil, there's no reason to pick up this game anymore. The 2-disc set here is one adventure with a male character and another with a female. The game is involved, just not as much fun as it shoud be"
5,THE BEST GAME FOR PLAYSTATION OR ANY OTHER SYSTEM!!!,The grafics were astounding. The way that they had diffrent sound effects when you walked on diffrent matireals was verry great. The fmv's (full motion videos) were amazing espesially the one that starts up when you come across the first licker. It is a verry horrifying game. The only downfall is that they are making a version for the Nintindo 64 which looks verry crappy...bad grafecs ect. It will probobly ruin the Resident Evil name. Otherwise it is wonderfull. ENJOY IT!!!!
5,Awesome.That's all that can be said.,"What can I say? Capcom gives us the coolest FMV,throws in the incredibly beautiful Claire Redfield and the chilling tale of zombies and voila!Instant success.The game will always outrank any other game on playstation.PERIOD!"
4,Resident is so fun,"If you liked all the other resident evil games, I guarantee it that you would like this game, and if you havent ever played any resident evil games you will defintely like this one. I hope this review was helpful to you."
4,The horror is back,"It's the second installment of the great horror sereis.The zombies in this game are much more scary.To start out with,Your in the city streets,what seems like a never ending battle through streets,alleys,a baketball court,a bus,and even a gunshop.As you find you find yourself in the RPD you find yourself in a long hard journey through zombies,Lickers,and even a toubled little girl always running into danger.Plus you meet up wit Leon again.Next up you can have yourself a lil bitta fun in the prison they call the sewers.Meet up with never ending beastand even take control over the lil girl......And finaly you end up in a factory full of evil and grown ups with an attitude problem.Did I mention a bomb?So you know this comes to show,your dead meet in a game ya can't beat."
5,The Best Action Video Game,"This is the best game I have ever played. It is extremly gory and is not for kids under 17, but I played it anyway. The graphics are very good for such an old game. The storyline is confusing if you didnt play the first one. I have the first one, and my brother read Resident Evil: 1 book. It isnt hard to beat. The Infinite Ammo code helps alot. That is why I love this game."
4,Off The Hook!,RE2 was definitely worth every penny I spent on it. I really enjoyed solving the puzzles and being scared while doing it. I can't wait for RE3 to come out. I know that it's going to be a hit. For the best effect. Play RE1 or RE2 in STEREO!
4,A must-have for Resident Evil fans.,"Beat the first yet? If you have, then jump right ahead to the second masterpiece in the series.It's fun, it's scary, and it is one hell of a ride. Ultimatley, Resident Evil 2 will give some nightmares. If the first one scared you, get ready to be terrified again!"
3,Overhyped,"There's a significant graphical overhaul since episode 1, but this fails to improve on or even to equal the original in any other respect. As a game in its own right, its pretty entertaining, if slightly short, but as a sequel to one of the most innovative and ingenious games of all time, its a disappointment of the highest order."
3,Not so much fun after awhile.,"I loved this game when i first played it. It has many puzzles and frustrating stuff that you have to get away from because of how hard they are. It took me 10 hours to beat the game just because the puzzle solving is very hard on normal mode. You can play an arrange game where you have unlimited ammo for a sub machine gun which is cheating but is part of the game when you first turn it on. This game is fun and challanging the first few plays with whatever character, (You can be Claire Redfield or Leon Kennedy.) but it will be a bore when you finish it."
4,resindent evil family,you herd about resindentevil 1and2 but what about three its the new game of the century but resindent evil 2 was good ovcourse I beat it but it was good enogh tobuy but I did'nt buy it so it was kind of fun
4,best of the series,I think this is the best game of the three game series. it has better grafics and controll then the first and more secrets. And it is better than thee because it has two people to chose from and more secrets. I hope 4 will be good
4,Made me shiver whenever I turned on the game. I loved it!,This was the first game that made me jump... I love the mini movies the graphics were so awsome.. I finished both Leon and Claire's Scenrio A and B I can't wait for Resident Evil 3!!
4,A should have,"Honestly, let's face it. RE2 was one of the best in the series and is always a serious must have. We're in the age of PS3's now and I understand that since it is 2012 that the graphics may not seem as good as they were when RE2 1st came out, but the gameplay is still awesome! Also, the voiceacting is at least a step up from RE1!"
4,Still The Childhood Fright Today,"This game kept me dreaming as a child back in the late 90's. I used to crave Resident evil 2 and its ""So realistic graphics"" (Hey, Back then, Ps 1 Was Awesome Graphics.) Its Scary, Its Frightening, And its Impossible to beat with just a knife. Give it a shot, Only downside is poor Voice acting, Like their captain obvious or something. But if you Played RE 3 this will seem like a Downer game. RE directors cut is where its at!"
4,"Okay, let me tell you what I thought of THIS one...","It's a great game, but the reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the storyline. To me, everything needs a great storyline. And this one had the worst. Now, I loved the gameplay, the new monsters, the characters, the puzzles, and the acting. But the storyline? plllbbttt! I do recommend this one though. It's a good sequel. But you can get much more fun and junk with the 3rd one: Nemesis. So, if you want to see what they did wrong with such a good game, get it. If you want better, 3 is the best way to go."
4,Killing zombies won't get better than this,"A must have for any Playstation owner who's looking for a good action title. Even with its minor draw-backs (like the controls, and the camera angles could get bad at times), you will still have a blast trying to figure out what's the new virus that is spreading through Racoon City. Even if you don't like action games, at least try renting it, I'm sure it will change your mind."
4,Best overall game for Playstation,"Well, lets see judging from me jumping out of my seat and pulling the controller out of its socket becouse of the suspense, Id say its the best game ive ever played, from detailed environments to the controll (it may take a while to get used to but after you get the hang of it its awesome) I think any playstation owner should buy this becouse you will regret you misses it if you didnt, I mean Blowing of zombies heads was never so much fun!!!!!!!!"
4,good game bad puzzles,this is a great game but the puzzles are to easy maybe if capcom would make the puzzles a little bit harder i'd give this game five stars on educational value
4,A very fun and scary game,RE2 scared the pants off me. the spooky music and great graphics draws you into the game. the story line is great and there are alot of surprizes around every corner of the police headquarters. Its a great sequel to RE and it is much better. Everyone will love the main characters and the puzzles will leave you stumped for hours. Plus the hidden secrets throughout the game makes an excellent replay value on the game. Also the high (and low) powered weapons scattered thoughout the game really make destroying zombies fun. Buy it for a good scare.
4,"A Great, Exiciting, Funny Mystery!","The Mystery of the Missing Suitcase is a great book. It is about figuring out a mystery about figuring out who is tring to rob the local bank and to try stoping him. At first,Derek, a member of the Spotlight Club [a mystery solving club]went on a trip and went home. He went home on a train and fell asleep and woke up finding a women with a strange hat on her head. She told him that she has to sit by him because a man on the train is following her and is after her money. Later on went Derek went to go get his suitcase, He picked up a suitcase that he thought was his. When he got home, he opened it and found some disguises and a camera. The Spotlight Club Members began to solve a mystery. At the end, they found out that the man that was trying to take the woman on the bus' money was a employee for the woman's brother. The woman on the bus' brother hired the man to make sure that his sister did not lose her purse."
2,Not the best,"I agree with other reviewers. Knee chairs are very comfortable and good for your posture, but not this one.My biggest beef with this chair is the base. Your feet get caught on it all the time, and it does not make it comfortable. There is also something wrong about the distance between the knee pad and the seat. The knee pad (as others mentioned) gets ""wobbly"" with time, but all you have to do is tighten it up, so that does not bother me that much.I still use it as my gaming chair, but I definitely cannot sit for very long time. When I get uncomfortable, I find myself sitting on it as a regular chair with my feet on the floor.I would avoid this one, and look for a different knee chair. There is something wrong with the design of it besides the base. It just does not feel quite right.For the quality of the chair, I would say this item is way overpriced.Thank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful"
2,"""Morbid and Depressing""","Oh, please! I have never read such a morbid and depressing novel in my life. This book is hog-wash plain and simple! Waste of time and good money. Yo, Ms. Julie Stevens Mason don't quit your day job!"
1,more like oregano,"I was disappointed by these eucalyptus leaves - they have a stale, oregano-like smell. Ask your local florist to get you some fresh leaves!"
2,I don't know what this means!,I am gravely disappointed. There are so many words I look up that aren't in this dictionary. I regret buying it. I am on a fixed income and this was a waste of my money.
2,Depends on what you are looking for,"We bought this for help communicating with our adopted child. A waste of money for any adoptive parent/child relationahip. It is missing what I would think are many basic human feelings and basic needs. I can not imagine a ""tourist"" or mission worker going to Haiti finding this book helpful either."
4,A good laugher,Funny Book and very telling on how football was back in the late 60's and early 70's. It brought back many memories of watching games with my family back when I was a youngster at home. The Snake was always one of my favorite QB's as were the Raiders as a team. Good light read for a good laugh. Highly recommended.
1,Who Let This CD Out?????,"Did someone call this ""Beach Music""????I'd hardly call it that!!! In my opinion, it doesn't even sound like music!!I agree with the review that said, ""Who let this song out?"" I couldn't have put it better myself. OK, I could: how about ""Who let this darned CD out??"" This isn't the kind of stuff I'd want to hear going ""BOOM-BOOM-BOOM"" in a car going by!! No way!! This is nuts!! By the way: if you happen to turn your car stereo's bass up on this CD so that it does go ""BOOM-BOOM-BOOM,"" that is nuts too!!"
1,Who Let these jokes out?!,"If you like these hacks, then take this CD and shove it up your...I'm not finishing this due to the fact that there are kids reading this.Enough said."
1,Sucks,"This CD sucks sucks sucks!! The only reason i'm giving itt 1 star is because it's the lowest rating amazon has! For REAL & GOOD music listen to:Lacuna Coil, Hatebreed, Unearth, Death, Megadeth, In Flames, Napalm Death, Slayer, Disgorge, Anthrax, etc."
2,I have no respect for the Baha Men,"When Who Let the Dogs Out first started playing on the radio, I thought it was extremely funny that a band could come up with a song that was so stupid, but yet is so successful. Because of this, I had some respect for the band, but then I saw them in concert at Mardi Gras at Universal Studios. They don't play any instruments and they dance around while they sing. In other words, the Baha Men are a boy band. I didn't realize this before, but now that I know it, I have trouble listening to this cd because of my lack of respect for any boy bands. The only song that I could listen to straight though for a good laugh is Who Let the Dogs out. Don't waste your money..."
1,THIS IS THE WORST SONG EVER!!!,"Who let the dogs out? WHO? WHO WHO WHO? WHO CARES!The fact that they even RELEASED this song is an insult to the collective IQ of the USA. It's hard enough to believe that they thought people would actually LIKE this song. What's even harder to believe is that people actually DO! With its nonsensical, annoying, shouted chorus, its irritating, headache-and-vomit-inducing ""island beeeeat"", and idiotic lyrics (""Yippee-Yi-Yo?""), this song wins my not-so-coveted award of THE WORST SONG EVER. There are MANY ""artists""/""songs"" I can't stand, but this one takes the cake. Every time I hear it come on, two seconds in, I actually get dry heaves. I would actually rather listen to Celine Dion than this junk, and that's really saying something.Who let this song out? Who let Carson Daly out? Who let a bunch of 13-year-old girls out? I'll tell you who: The Baha Men, and they should be put to sleep."
1,They are so dead...,"ONE POPULAR SONG! ONE! That's all. Sure, Nickeoldean thought there were gold, but they're not. Rapper wanna-bes who can't write music. I don't think anyone even liked that ""Who Let The Dogs Out"", it was just fun to sing with friends to annoy others. I mean, does anyone even know any part of the song except the chorus? That's all the proof you need, kids."
4,Comprehensive Review of the 1930's,"Ellis kept a running diary for most of his adult life. He culls much interesting information from this source as well as several better known authors in painting a vivid picture of what happened in America starting in 1929 and why. This is not to say that the book does not have some flaws. For one thing Ellis has a tendency of placing trivial comments such as ""Rexford Tugwell was quite the handsomest New Dealer of them all"" which frankly could have been better left unsaid. However, some of his historical information, particularly his chapter on the National Recovery Act, entitled the Blue Eagle, are well researched and very easy to read. I also like the opening chapter on the death of the original Waldorf-Astoria Hotel (now the site of the Empire State Building). This is an excellent juxtaposition considering that this event took place in the infamous year of 1929 and happened on May Day to boot."
5,"Perfect fit, good price and fast shipping",I searched all over town for this shift cable and found the cheapest to be $179 and out of stock. I started looking online and was suprised to find this item at Amazon and with two day shipping I received the part in perfect condition and saved over $100 as well.Installed part (which fit perfectly) in about 30 minutes and was running again.
5,Most Used Book in Parish Library,"This book has a lot of useful advice and is very contemporary! Don't be fooled by the word ""Recluse"". He retired and continued to write. He really knows his stuff!!"
3,Fun,"It's pretty average, but it's fun. It's impossible to win without a memory card, and very difficult. It has good graphics. I think Crash Bandicoot Warped is much better and more fun."
5,highly recommend this game!,best game i have ever played...and i've been playing it since i was little (in the 90's).highly recommend this game! especially if you like adventure games that are good for the entire family.
2,Crash bandicoot,This game will not save. You have to play it over and over. Not fun for my grandson. Can't accomplish final goal.
3,Crash Bandicoot 2:Cortex Strikes Back.,"This game is extreamley well made. I don't think it beats the first game [ except the save system and N.gin boss ]. I say that the story and graphics are fairly made. I don't like Crash's new style, except his dance. Don't get me wrong, I think his style is always very well modeld. I think the level select is very nice, but I like games where you have to go in order. I thunk they made a mistake in not adding Tawnya [ I call her Twanya] to the story. She does not show up again till CTR. Bt, with each character in that game you play with, shows Twanya in a different costume when you win first place. I really think Twanya sholdn't be so little awknowlaged. After all, she played a huge part in the very beginning of all Crash's adventure. I will lkeave you a cheat. To re-fight bosses, hold triangle down as you go through a floor. THat's my re-view."
4,Very good!,"This game is an improvemnet on the original, but Tawna should still be there, there should be a 2-player mode, and there should be a way to re-fight bosses, like a door that opens up when you get 5 crystals. But the game's levels are better, the bosses are better, there's a secret world, and there's a much better save sytem with out any passwords at all, which is what I'm talkin' about when it comes to games! The crystal improvement is good too. I like this game better then the original, except for the problems above."
4,HOURS OF FUN,"This game is great. I have completed it once but heard there is another ending if you get all the gems! Not only is it fun, it is a challenge. I gave it 4 stars (instead of 5) since I have not finished it completely."
4,GREAT FOR YOUNG AND OLD,"I just purchased my first sony playstation for my 5yr old son(ok, ok it for me too lol)--I purchased this game and both of us love it--lots of actions--great graphics--and always keeps u guessing!!--Can't wait to try Crash #3."
4,"Easily put, Crash Bandicoot 2 is WAY better than the first.","Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back is the second in a long line of Crash Bandicoot's. This Game is almost totally flawless (but hey, every game can't be perfect but this game comes damn close.)Plot: Crash is back kidnapped to help Cortex collect crystals. 9/10Gameplay: The Gameplay is what you'd expect in a platformer. There are five warp rooms with twenty-five levels. You have to finish each level by collecting all three crystals for that level. If you run out of lives you lose and can return to the last level played. 8/10Sound: The sound is very good and has a nice soundtrack. 8/10Graphics: The graphics were high quality back in 1997. They still are surprising for today's standards, They work and are eye appealing. 7/10Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back is one of the best Naughty Dog PlayStation 1 game. Easily put, Crash Bandicoot 2 is WAY better than the first.8/10"
4,The Bandicoot is back!,"This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump, crawl, slide, ride on a jetboat, and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh, and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game, then you won't need it, but... it's recommended. In conclusion, this is a fantastic game, and if you love this, make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!"
4,GREAT GAME- Kind of difficult to be honest...,"Great game, and great service from amazon. Love it, kind of hard and it takes awhile to beat. One of those games you can pick up anywhere!"
3,Deja Vu,"C'mon! The game's pretty fun, but not when you have to play the same levels over and over and over again! Examples are ""Road to Ruin"" and ""Ruination"". They're the exact same thing! Sometimes I thought I already played a level, when I was on a whole new floor. The bosses are kind of easy, too... The only reason I'm giving this game three stars is because it's sort of funny when Crash gets abused (ex. getting stung by bees) and it's challenging to collect all the gems."
1,This little Guy can BE Good at this and Twinsanity Kind of G,"If you like orange bandicoots and video games, then get Crash Bandicoot, the stuff of dreams and legends. ""I am N.Gin you FOOL! Face my destructive robots!"" That is my fave quote. If you hop on the 'shrooms right before the end o' the 2nd snow bear level and go to the central one, you shall find none other but a secret tele-port. You will go to an unknown warp room that makes no sense. Congrats."
2,"very average platformer, in my opinion","this game is real average, get Mario 64, or Sonic Adventure. Or if you have only a playstation, try spyro the dragon, it's much better."
3,"Decent, but pretty flimsy","This was a lot more flimsy than I expected. It cuts well so far, so overall I'm pleased with the knife."
5,Great Knife Made in USA!!!!,"I have been familiar with Rada Knives most of my life. My parents had their paring knives most of my life. They are a Wonderful knife that sharpens easily and hold up well. I purchased the paring knife a few months ago and really love it. I bought the utility knife last month because I really like the brand and being made in USA is wonderful. I use it for just about everything, it chops veggies, cuts meat and cleans up nicely. I don't put my knives in the dishwasher, it tends to ruin them. So a quick wash in the sink and dry and in the block. Very great knife company and Great knives."
5,Best bargain knife out there,I was in the market for some cheaper knives to live in my camper. I found I like them so much I have purchased some for the house. The quality is great and the blades hold a razor sharp edge. These knives are being used more than some which are 10X their price. Best bang for the buck I have found.
1,not so duable,need improvement. . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . .some durability.......... . . . . . .............
1,A big disappointment,"I returned this knife. Not only was it rather flimsy for my tastes, but it also had a handle that felt like fiberglass. I really thought that it was not a finished product, and that I may get shards of metal in my hands."
5,Sharp as a razor!,Found this knife by word-of-mouth. It is my favorite knife!! Sharp as can be and easily resharpened when it looses its edge with the available sharpener.
5,Rada Utility Knife,I love the Rada Cutlery and I plan on purchasing more. I love the feel of the handle and the sharpness of the blades.
2,"Not a bad case, but it has a problem...","This is a nice-looking case, but I'm giving it 2 stars because I found out that my external earpiece cannot be fully plugged in with this case. Although the hole in the case matches the one in the phone, it is not big enough, and the leather prevents the earpiece cord from making full contact with the phone. Of course, if you are planning to use your phone with a Bluetooth earpiece, this shouldn't be an issue at all. But I wanted to use this case with a Plantronics earpiece (and a Treo 700w)."
2,Clunky and inconvenient,"I bought this at the suggestion of a friend. I replaced the original Treo holster which constantly unlocked allowing the phone to drop. I thought that this had all the features that I wanted, and it did, except it also had two very unwanted features; 1) it took a relatively slim and lightweight PDA and turned it into a clunky heavy instrument and 2) the snap on cover makes it difficult to answer, you need to unsnap first. This should have been a magnetic closure.I think some of the other Krusell products would be a better choice for me, one without the cover which doubles the amount of leather.I tossed this and ordered another holster by another manufacturer, one that hopefully will not lose the phone every time I stand or sit."
4,Nice leather Case but a bit bulky,"I like this case because the leather is of good quality and the case design is nice because it covers the screen when not in use. It also makes the phone look really nice like a nice wallet. However, it can be a bit bulky. Another thing that I don't like about it is the hole for the headset does not fit right so often I have to struggle to push the head set plug through the leather. You also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered. Overall, it really protects the phone and looks really nice."
3,Headset problems,The only problem that I had with the case is finding a headset that will plug into the phone while it is in the case. The headset prong has to be longer than your standard plug-in headset. Other than that it is great!
4,Great look and great leather,"I have used this case for over a month now. This case looks great and the quality of the leather is great! I agree with another reviewer that the case could look a little bulky, but it doesn't affect my usage and honestly, I don't mind considering its overall look and quality.You have to flip open the cover of this case to use camera. However, this doesn't affect usage much - at least not for me.Overall,I like this case a lot and also the price compared with other cases."
2,"Oh, brother!","These two films are geared to the gay market, with lingering shots on young studs; some other reviewers may deny this but they obviously didn't notice how the chief vampire eyed the young stud. (It's not that subtle!)I can say though that these two movies are well filmedThe first movie is about a frat of vampires who want to initiate a young studly jock. These vampires are fangless though, using instead an amulet (similar in concept to 1983s ""The Hunger"").I can't understand why, when two guys get into bed with a lady to feed from her they all remain in their underwear. She obviously gets a high from feeding them, but I can't see why... whether she's on drugs already, or not, because these vampires don't seem to be able to mesmerise their prey.The second film is about a young warlock who tries to initiate 3 studs into a covern. This is even less interesting than the first, but just as elegantly filmed."
4,Good Movie,This is a good movie but not great. They couldn't make up their mind if they were making a gay or straight movie. It comes across gay but hiding. It would have been a better movie if they had went ahead and made their characters gay. A early Sam Page is good looking in this even tough he shaved his chest for the movie. Still buy this movie.
1,Hollywood Strikes Again,"Once again, corporate america is attempting to gouge our pockets (and our common sense) with this junk offering. I am a die-hard JLA fan but I refuse to give in to this DVD piracy. This is classic carrot-and-stick. Once they've exhausted these copies MAYBE they'll finally start offering complete seasons. Don't waste your money on this piece of garbage.Real JLA fans will protest and fight this injustice."
1,Justice League he collection,"Lets face it. Most of us love the Batman, Superman and the Justice League and would pay the money for the boxed sets so you could sit and watch a good quality show. However they put out a Justice League DVD every blue moon making you jump at the chance to buy it when you see it out on the shelves.Then later you release another and so on. Then you release a ""collection"" of maybe three in a set. Come on!!! You know a vast majority of people would buy the Justice League Season 1 & 2 etc.. straight out or Superman or Batman. We have been loyal fans. Release the complete seasons on boxed sets. Thanks Mike"
1,let's go to eBay!!!,"I agree with all the reviewers here. So I won't repeat what they said. Because of this, I have been going to eBay for complete season sets at reasonable prices. Wake up Warner Brothers!"
2,"This ""collection"" is not for real collectors.","Real collectors want the complete season, not just a few episodes that are going to be included in the complete season anyway!! Its also overpriced considering what you're getting.I'm in total agreement with the majority of fans of Batman Animated, Justice League, etc.. when say how i'm dissapointed with the DVD offerings that Warner is releasing and which they are not releasing.I am speaking for more then myself when I say there is demand for the complete first season in a boxed set just like was recently released with Batman Animated Vol 1. Warner, stop trying to get us to buy the same ""collection"" or episodes twice. I vote to not buy these incomplete collections and wait for the real complete season sets."
1,No sense in buying this,"If you are going to spend this much on Justice League DVDs, then you must like the show quite a bit. And if that's the case, why buy such a slipshod release? You might as well wait a short while before they finally start releasing seasons - which they have finally done with Batman: The Animated Series and Superfriends."
1,WE WANT SEASON BOX SETS! STOP PLAYING WARNER!,Fans wants SEASON BOX SETS now! Stop playing with us and making more $ at our expenses....bring out SEASON BOX SETS NOW! This 3 DVD Pack a.k.a JUSTICE LEAGUE COLLECTION are the 3 first single DVDs releases in 1!!!! No way! How can you call it a JL COLLECTION?? OMG! WARNER BROS. PLEASE LISTEN TO THE FANS FOR GOD'S SAKE.
4,A MUST for any sneaker fiend,"If you are a sneaker fiend this book is a must.Scoop Jackson does a great job documenting the history of Nike's basketaball sneakers. Its mainly a picture book, which is pretty good for reference and features, in addition to photos of just about every Nike basketball sneaker ever produced, classic posters and athlete photos.If you are looking for a comprehensive biography of Nike's history in this field, this isn't the book for you"
3,Oops,less than i expected. i'm a hard-core nikee. but the book is not prepaired as good as shoes. lots of out of date Ads. only few Air Jordan in detail. the catalog almost as same as website. To see it in your local book store before you click on the ADD TO CART.
5,So nostalgic it hurts!,"I heard this fine selection when I was a student in Hertfordshire. I was born in 1960, and for the life of me I can't imagine how I heard any of this material. I must have only been in primary school. And yet this stuff immediately stirred and moved me. It has so much soul, this stuff is irresistable. If you weren't there, it will make you feel like a fully paid up member of the sixties, like you were really one of the dudes...It has so much to offer (""Underdog"" really jumps) and the inventiveness of the horn parts... Well, you would get a good deal from this in so many ways, but more than anything, the yearning and longing for the years past when this stuff was being made.What soul... Where are you now, Sly old friend?"
1,Are we sure this is really Bill Moyers?,"I was pretty sorely disappointed in this disc. I expected to see news footage or even accounts from people who spoke above a monotone. Instead, it consisted of a collection of very boring individuals ""experts"" and such, sharing their thoughts, some of it pertinent, some of it just rambling.I am giving it a one star rating based on the fact that I liked the cover art on the disc. That's about all I liked, though.Bill Moyers is normally a great journalist. Why he would choose to attach his name to this disc is beyond me. Perhaps he could have collected different guests, people who are speaking from real life and not from text book theories, and then it would be worth the purchase price.I would save my money on this....nnless you have chronic insomnia, which this disc is SURE to cure as it put me right to sleep both times I tried to watch it in it's entirety."
5,The Real Temptations,"I'm glad I saw this video advertised. I always liked the Temps music, but don't think I ever saw them on TV. We have the DVD of their movie, which was very well done - wonderful acting. Don't know how many times we have watched it. But to see the actual singers doing their songs is just amazing. The DVD is very good - color & sound great. We saw the Temptations at a dinner-theater several years ago in PA. Not the original ones, of course, but the group touring now. Only one was a true Temp from the past. Still enjoyed it. I really like this DVD!!"
3,Underwhelmed,"This collection was okay, but The Temptations have another DVD collection of their performances that I think is much better. It's called Get Ready: Definitive Performances 1965-1972 [DVD] and it pretty much includes all the performances on this DVD, plus more."
1,A KEEPSAKE,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS DVD, BRINGS BACK SOME OLE MEMORIES OF THE GOOD OLE DAYS. WILL USE AS A KEEPSAKE FOR MY GRAND CHILDREN"
3,Old Original Groups,"The best thing about this video, it has the original artist that first started the Temptations group. It has a good collection of the greatest songs sung by the group. This is a must to have if you are a Temptations fan."
4,Classic guy film!,"It's a good movie for the male gender or gals who enjoy guy type movies..By that, I mean if you enjoy the movie Friday, Swingers or Mall Rats odds are you will like this movie. The viewer who rated this only one star below evidently has a problem with people who gamble. If this is you, dont buy this movie!...lol..Enjoy"
2,Good product but slowpork shipping,"The product is good for Chinese learning beginners. But it take very long time to receive them. I asked and paid for ""two-day shipping"", after 9 days I checked the website showing me that ""not shipped yet""!!!! Really do not understand what the ""two-day shipping"" means. I called Amazon and was told that ""two-day shipping"" means after shipping starts then you will get it within 2 days. How rediculous it is!"
1,Awful,I'd give it 0 stars if I could. I used to be a language teacher and this book uses a very outdated methodology (audio lingual) which is based on repetition rather than a more modern approach to language learning called communicative competence.If you sign up for to learn Chinese and they use this book run do not walk to the registrar to drop the course and find a program that uses a more up-to-date approach to language learning.
4,"Helpful, thorough, and well-organized","I appreciate the good explanations, Exercises, CDs, Cutural Insights and Language Points. A very well-organized book. Compact to carry. Further discussion or analysis of the differences between the sound systems of Chinese (pinyin) and English would have been good additions. Also,if there were two additional indexes of the vocabulary items used--in Chinese, and in English translation-- the book would be easier to use on an ongoing basis as I review, practice and apply the words in various sentence patterns."
4,Good book for Begginers,Good book with concise material. You can learn the basics for everyday conversation in Chinese. Both in Chinese caracters and pinyin. Has exercises for practice. Explains important points of the language. Has interesting cultural insights.
3,yong ho beginner's and intermediate chinese.,"I bougt those books twice, second times w. CDs. Books was rated 5, because they were very very practical to a non chinese native speaker. CDs was rated 2 or 3, because volume recorded was low and muffle on CD2 of beginn bk and CD of intermed bk, accent was problably from non beijing speakers i.e not typical,compared to pimsleur or to broadcasting progam in China or abroad,pitch was not typically male, some last lessons were not well recorded, may be they did not use professional recording devices,speed was too slow even for a beginner.I wished they will issue better quality CDs in a near future."
5,Excellent tool for learning Mandarin,"I have been teaching Mandarin Chinese for years and this book is one of the best Mandarin textbooks I have seen. It is easy to understand, and also includes useful vocabulary, grammar, and cultural notes in each lesson. Along with the book, there are 2 audio CDs with recordings of the dialogues from the book. I highly recommend it."
2,Beginners' Chinese,"This book is best used in a classroom situation. I purchased for independent home study. The speed of the language on the CDs is too fast to understand clearly. The CDs are Chinese only, they are not your typical: speak/repeat format. Not recommened for personal use. Definitely need a tutor or instructor."
5,Very good introduction,I liked it. I have looked at many introductions and this is one of the better ones. A good introduction. I am soon going to check out the followup.
4,I used this to study space when I was going to grad school,Surprisingly I actually used this series to understand Space Systems and Design for my masters. This was quite comprehensive and allowed me to put things in perspective. I would recommend this to all Aerospace Engineers or anyone working in the Space environment.
1,What is going on here Amazon?,"Ordered ""From the Earth to the Moon (2005)"" from amazon because the description said ""1.33:1"" aspect ratio.Be aware before you buy this version, that it is NOT in the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio as originally produced and broadcast.The top and the bottom of the image has been removed to make it 1.78:1 or ""16x9 wide screen"". I'm very disappointed. This is a great series, but I don't like being lied to in the amazon product description."
5,A great Documentry,A well put together accurate account of the US space race to the moon.No expense was spared in this documentry to give the viewer a sense of what actually went on behind the scenes at NASA
5,A series to remember !,"If you were born in the sixties and you want to remember the Apollo program or if you want your kids to watch and learn what going to the moon was all about you must get this DVD ! Superb grapics, touching music, great acting.Special note : I have read newsgroup reports of people who actually WORKED on the Appllo project saying that the series was flawless and provided an authentic representation of the Apollo era. If you love space there is no way you will not love From the Earth to the Moon."
1,"Docudrama? Next, please...","Well, it's my first ever experience with docudrama format, and the very last - for I was quite disappointed. There's enough archive material to make such lame reenacting absolutely absurd. As a drama it fails utterly (acting is, well, not that convincing) and it's anything, but documentary (you may as well study the history of WWII by means of Pearl Harbor movie). It's just as bad as Armageddon, but with no Aerosmith in the soundtrack."
1,Gee Whiz Aren't We Neato?,"This is not a documentary. It is a long movie based on actual events, obviously made by Americans. It has too much ""gee whiz aren't these American guys just so neato?"" thrown in for me to enjoy it. Though it may be a matter of pride that we got to the moon first, this volume is too maudlin and patriotic for me to enjoy it as a documentary, which is what I thought it was."
1,Can't review as we are 2 months & counting & still no order,My first and last dealing with Amazon.caOrdered Dec 5 for Christmas delivery (New Years at worst) and I doubt if I will see it by Valentine's day as I just got another email saying that it is delayed again.There is an import listed that can be shipped in 24 hours but they are too cheap to send that too make up for the delay.Amazon.com has it for about $10 more but it will be here by the week-end.Nice way to do business.
1,From the Earth to the Moon,"I will not be doing business with amazon again, the DVD that was I received was defected and I think amazon knew it, I talked to amazon and they told me to return it, I am not going to do that, I am thinking of turning it over to the AG in Oregon, this isn't the first time this has happend but it will be the last for me. I've been telling eveyone I know what I think of amazon and so far they to have stopped using amazon.SincerelyJesse Slade(503) 364-3158"
5,wonderfully told history,We first watched this entire series on netflix and fell in love with it. If you have any interest in the space program at all it will hold your interest and you will learn even more.When Amazon ran this as a gold box special we bought 3 sets - one for us and one for each of our parents.
5,from the earth to the moon,I like too much space films.This DVD teached me how have it been started since the beginnig and how everything were developed.
5,This is something that cannot be express but EXPERIENCE!,"I was born in 1976 and thus had not experience the journey from the earth to the moon first hand. Being able to experience this great endeavour by way of 'FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON' has made me even more appreciative of the lengths at which MAN HAS EVOLVED. For the men that made it possible to travel to the moon there is not enough gratitude in the world that I and others like me could ever express!I think 'FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON' should be a part of everyone's lives, it not only teaches about the enormous ability of man to accomplish that which was once thought impossible. It shows us also that as great as we are capable of being we will nevertheless always be vunerable and thus subject to mistakes, but it is mistakes and learning from them that leads us to the path of success and that which is great!Get this video! It will change the way you look at yourself and man FOREVER!"
5,Great! A must see for anyone interested in the Space Program,I was born in 1978 so I missed out on the entire Apollo Program. This series showed so much that I could not find any place else. I can not count how many times I have watched this series it never gets old. The small details are great like to xenon lights used on the moon shots. I recomend this to anyone that would like to know about the behind the sceens of NASA.
5,I wish a day had 48 hours so I could view all in 1 go,It's been a long time since I monopolised the tv set but this is worth it
5,Tom Hanks should be pleased with himself,"I saw this mini-series when it aired on HBO, and when the DVD set was available at the library, I checked it out and watched it twice. Finally, we broke down and bought the set; its worth three times it's price! My six year old enjoys watching it with us, as he has an interest in anything related to space. Each episode is wonderful, providing accurate information about the Apollo space program within the framework of vivid storytelling. The acting is top notch; it's hard to believe these guys didn't actually go into space themselves! For entertainment or educational purposes, From The Earth to The Moon is a must see by anyone interested in the space program, or in the mood for good drama."
1,"Wonderful for hearing people, crappy for others....","I lived during this time, and I well remember the excitement of watching the space program at that time. Alas, I can't get that excitement back from watching this otherwise excellent series. Why? Because I'm deaf, and because HBO, even though it spent oodles of money on producing this series, continued its long-time habit of ignoring deaf audiences and didn't spend the extra pittance to provide closed captions on these videos. About 3 million Americans are getting shut out of Hank's loving tribute to Project Apollo because of this short-sighted attitude on HBO's part. If you care about those things, please write to HBO and express your indignation, and maybe, just maybe, HBO will see fit to close-caption this great series on its next reissue, opening it up to a greater audience."
1,Not the 1998 1.33:1 release advertised,"Ordered the listed item: 1998 release with 1.33:1 aspect ratio (the original release). Received instead a set clearly marked as 16:9 with a 2009 copyright. Not an improvement. Disappointing. The conversion to 16:9 simply cut off parts of the original. Not worth the loss. Can order current version of 16:9 release for far less, if that version was what I sought."
5,Great Series and great value,"This is a magnificent series and the price/value ($13) for the DVD set is outstanding. Substantively, I noted a couple of what I thought were mistakes. In the episode on Alan Shepherd's Mercury flight, he is shown firing retro rockets and descending through a fiery re-entry. But since Shepherd never went into orbit, there was no need to re-enter, thus no need to fire retro-rockets and certainly no fiery descent-although the astronaut did endure high G-forces. I think the producers were misled by the fact that Shepherd went through the retro-fire process to test it for orbital flights.Other than that, this is a fabulous series. In particular, I liked the fact that each episode is essentially a separate mini-movie told from different perspectives. None of them are formulaic. And the music is magnificent."
4,From the Earth to the Moon,"exactly as expected and just what I wanted, an entertaining vision of the space program. some of the information was powerful to me, since I was old enough to experience the landing (for example) but still young enough to not fully understand the significance, excitement, danger."
1,Aspect Ratio Revisited,"In previous reviews the aspect ratio of this DVD set is often mentioned. I have to agree with those reviewers who state that the aspect ratio is wrong. It may be true that the series was shot in 16:9 and I remember seeing it that way on Belgium TV, but this is not that version! When watching these DVDs it very soon becomes clear that something is wrong: the top of people's heads are frequently cut off, sometimes an action that takes place at the bottom of the screen is not visible. I also own the Dutch DVD-set of this great series which has 4:3 aspect ratio, no extras but very cheap, less than $10,00. Comparison showed that the Signature Editon used the 4:3 version and chopped off the upper and lower part to get a 16:9 version. Again, if the series was originally shot in 16:9 than this is not that version! Shame on you HBO for passing this chopped up version of a brilliant series as an expensive so called Special Edition!"
5,A great series,"I loved every minute of this video. it is really good on the dvd format- the sound is especially excellent. All of the 12 parts were very well done- I especially liked the Apollo 12 segment. The only disappointment was the Apollo 13 segment. They never show anything inside the capsule- only a story about reporters. Overall, it was still a great series that I will watch again and again"
4,Great,Simply the best and most comprehensive program. Hanks approaches this story from an angle never thought of. He takes the most critical part of each mssions and details it. As the 10 episodes unfold you have the story of a complete mission from a to z. Hanks is a genius.....GET this DVD set if you are a moon fan. Get this DVD so your kids can find out what we had to do to get to the moon and back without killing the people who went. It is an historical monument to the endevour. It is a history lesson that is fun to learn.
4,"We're Go, Flight...","""From the Earth to the Moon"" is an epic worthy to tell the Gemini and Apollo astronauts' stories.That said, the one thing that jarred me was the amatuerish special effects that occasionally popped up. For instance, when Alan Shepard reenters the earth's atmosphere in Freedom 7, it almost looks like a tiny model strung up in front of a sky backdrop--it reminded me of the old 60's TV show ""Thunderbirds,"" it was so hokey. It was obvious that HBO did not have the bankroll to snag Digital Domain, the same people who did ""Apollo 13."" (To steal a quote from another space film: ""No bucks, no Buck Rogers."")Luckily, those glaring moments are few and far between, which is why I gave it 4 stars."
5,The most significant event of the 20th century retold,"From the Earth to the Moon was the best popular work I have ever seen (other than the movie Apollo 13) on the effort to put a man on the Moon. From the story of the fire of Apollo 1 to Neil Armstrong's first step on the Moon and finishing with the climax of Apollo in Apollo 17, The series has something that everyone can enjoy. A must for anyone interested in Contempory History or Man's quest to reach the Stars."
2,Product not as Advertised,The product details online say that the aspect ratio is 1.33:1 (4:3). The box and all the CDs say 16:9 widescreen and it is wide screen (16:9) when you play the CDs.This means that this is not an original version as advertised. It also means that top of people heads are cut off and what takes place at the bottom of the screen is missing.You get 5 CDs not 4 so what I am guessing they are advertising (selling you) one version and shipping a different version.
4,"""The Golden Age Of Space Travel, Revisited""","This HBO production, executive produced by Tom Hanks is not without it's flaws. At times when it seems like the episodes should be searing, and dramatic, they instead wax sentimental. The music is also rather unremarkable, with the exception of Brad Fiedel's fine contribution to the installment ""We Interrupt This Program.""For all of that, Hanks, and company manage to pull off the gargantuan feat of illustrating for us, the trials, and the victories that were Project Apollo. Considering the amount of material that had to be covered, they do so with finesse, and unwavering aplomb. No space historian would want to miss having this docudrama in their library."
2,Decent programs but deceitful representation.,"I bought a new copy of this item locally at a discount and immediately returned it. The program itself is not bad but it is a dramatic program and whomever did the packaging went out of their way to conceal this from the buying public. No mention of actors or anything, you would think it was Science Channel or something but it is just a dramatic presentation not a documentary as it appears. Even the official product reviews manage to maintain this deceit. If I had known it was a dramatic show, I might have enjoyed it, but as I do not appreciate being deceived I took it promptly back and the manufacturers can suffer the loss."
3,Docu-drama - not history,"You know those TV shows that say 'based on actual events' - but not really the facts? This is one of those. Tom Hanks brings his over the top acting style to directing giving us a very soapy version on NASA history. The first DVD gives 10 minutes to Shepard's flight and a brief mention of space walking and docking - docking being one of the MOST important achievements. The remaining hour + is about the Apollo fire, showing supposed 'behind the scenes' arguments about safety vs staying on schedule, the publics right to know vs NASA keeping their game face. The show spend a disproportionate amount of time on what in reality was a small setback in the space race and it tells us nothing about the science and enginering that went into getting to the moon."
5,Cheaper than renting it.,"I am always astounded that out of the 100+ channels of TV I get, there is frequently absolutely nothing that is worthy of the relatively few hours I devote to entertainment TV. Programs such as this provide a happy respite."
5,The second greatest story ever told...,"I originally rented the set and saw episodes 1,2,5,6,9,10 because I did not realize there were 4 episodes on each DVD. The series seemed a little disjointed, then I realized what I had done. So on the bright side I'll be seeing it again for the first time. But this time I am not renting...I am buying! Great job Tom Hanks!!BTW, The hedge trimmer I got for Christmas is going back to pay for this...John"
5,A must see for history buffs and space enthusiasts,"A phenomenally well-done and comprehensive mini series on the history of the early space program and the people who made it all happen. My 8-year old gives this 5 stars because the system won't let him give it a 100, and I completely agree.I do have two parental warnings: The episode ""1968"" includes some graphic news footage from that year, and the episode ""That's All There Is"" contains some pretty strong language and small images of 1960s pinups. Neither prevented us from choosing to watch the mini series with our child, but we did block his view for portions of ""1968."" During ""That's All There Is,"" we paused frequently to talk about how our word choices can affect other people and about how the objectification of women negatively affects both women and men."
4,"Good, but it is not The Right Stuff","OK, The Right Stuff is one of my favorite movies of all times, but it was a movie. You sat down and watched it front to back and felt like you knew more about the Mercury program and the people in it.Well, From the Earth to the Moon gives you that same feel like you know the people, but the mini-series format really kills that sense of story you got with The Right Stuff.Look, if you are a space buff, buy this and watch it with your kids when they are old enough to handle the language (which gets a little rough around the edges at times)."
4,Needs less politics.,Great history on the space program.It would have been better if there were less focus on the politics of the era and more emphasis on the astronauts and their missions.
5,Great Gift,"I bought this for my dad, an aerospace engineer, and he loves it. A great gift for anyone interested in space, science, history, or who just loves a great story."
5,Earth to the Moon-Signature Edition,"This documentary series focuses mainly on the people involved in the Apollo missions. It is well done and very watchable, even for those who don't profess to be ""history buffs"". Personally, I would have liked to have seen more about the science and hardware involved in going to the moon, but even so I highly recommend this series."
5,Excellence in Presentation,"I wasn't an HBO subscriber when this film came out and only saw one portion at a friend's home during its original run. That was enough to convince me to buy the series on DVD even before I owned any electronics that would play DVDs. Since then, I've purchased a DVD player and I am as impressed by the content and the quality of this production as I was back when I saw it the first time. For those that are younger, it takes a committment to get through all the episodes, but they will learn much and reap great rewards. For those of us that were actually alive during the Apollo years, who watched as NASA unfolded a dream for us, Tom Hanks and HBO take us where we only dreamed. Despite its cost, I can easily recommend this set and would encourage moving it to the top of your buy list. It is a welcome look at a time when this country had the courage and the imagination to do things that were indeed great."
4,A really great experience,"This series is wonderful for families who want their children to know what the space program was all about. Granted, it's a bit difficult to keep up with all the characters; but it's one of the most in depth, detailed space program series we've seen. Extremely informative and a must see. We had to force ourselves to turn off the television and call it a night with this series! The only reason why we didn't give it a 5 is because there were so many people involved in the space program whom they discussed which are a bit difficult to track and remember. So we've decided to purchase this to watch over and over again and look forward to our children being old enough to understand and watch what the space program was all about. Truly spectacular."
5,Best thing on TV in a long time. A very long time.,"Hanks has vividly captured an era and the visionaries that peopled it. Effects, acting, story, and depth of treatment all first rate. Many sides, complex interactions, all depicted with just the right intensity.Really appreciated the focus on the builders in the Grumman episode. All to often, the attention is only on the end product - the jockeys that get to ride the horse. But there would be no horse without the army of dedicated builders in the background. Hanks has captured the hard-nosed, competent, rising-to-the-challenge, 60's aerospace engineer mentality with grace and brilliance. It's almost like peering into a time capsule.On a side note: It would be a wonderful thing if this and perhaps more like it could capture the imagination of a new generation to think, to dream, and to have the courage to project themselves beyond this horizon (kudos and apologies to R. A. Heinlein :))"
2,Man I Wish I'd Listened to the Bootleg First,"Like I said in the title, I really should have listened to the bootleg version my friend had a few weeks ago that way I would have saved $10. This cd is weak and I really can't take too much of it. Im so dissapointed in it that it actually makes me angry when I try to listen to it. And I had such high hopes for this cd and band. RATS!"
1,Extreme dissapointment doesnt begin to describe this album,"TBS has pretty much died after their member changes. This album is a complete negative change from the Tell all your friends we all know and love. Its not the same. Some bands have managed to change in a good way from album to album (brand new). This is just horrible. DO NOT BUY IT. DONT SPEND A PENNY. Dont even see them in concert anymore, its just not the same as the old days (Ive been to old and new concerts, trust me.)"
1,TBS-Cut From The Team,"I hate TBS for many reasons. They make crappy, untalented music. Their biggest fans are 12-16 year olds. And most of all, they made this crappy genre of ""screamo"" or whatever and got it played on the radio so now their are a million boy bands all over which are carbon copies of TBS. And they all suck. This is not rock and roll. This is not even rock. This is untalented noise. And i listen from everything from punk to reggae to death metal to classic rock so i know music kiddies. This whole generation of music absolutely sucks. I even met TBS at a party at my friends house once and smoked a joint with Adam, the singer while he was completely wasted and i regret not telling him his music sucked."
1,"Emo is pure,wussie crap","I hate emo to death, only rich skinny [...] posers listen to this emo,screamo p[...]. Not original, if you want good music listen to one of the innovators of rock and that is Korn"
3,Just a Side Note,"I have never listened to this album, or this band 'cept a few songs. Thats not really what I am after here. There is a guy mr.punk rocker...... Christ man.... This guy He calls his self punk dissing this band while he listens to the Clash and Green Day... While I do like Green Day, I will be the first person to admit that they are not punk, they may have originally been inspired by bands like the Descendents and Screeching Weasle, which is oldschool pop-punk(please excure my run on sentances and speeling errors I happened upon thisat 3:00am). Well This guy rants in his other reviews about how punk Green day is.....You want some punk don't listen to him, check out Black Flag(Keith Morris as the singer), Circle Jerks, Agent Orange(first album) TSOL, 7 seconds, Millions Of Dead Cops , Bad Brains, Early Bad Religeon,The Exploited. Any ways from the samples on this site the afformentioned Taking Back Sunday has some cool vocal stylings........ So enough ranting. Carry on Children."
1,.........,The only thing about this that keeps me from falling asleep is the piercing annoyance of that cliche-modern-emo voice which is coincidentally about as welcome as the 6 a.m. alarm clock.
3,this is a review of Tbs not emo,"the last 3 posts realy proved to me how much people love to spout the opions about something they either know nothing about or think they know better then the back of there hand. Guess what you probibly dont. Alot of people say that being emo is just a bunch of people fealing sorry for themselves, true. So tell me the difference between them an the people who look like there going to a funeral all the time an listen to metal? My point is stop posting stuff that is an opion of how much better you think you are than everyone else an just write a review of the album. Any way now that I've got that off my chest the album is decent, but not ass good as the first. There are good songs on the ablum but its not a turn it on an leave it on, you'll probibly find your self skipping songs. But i do look forward to there next.o an for the guy who listed some bands none of them are better than tool but thats just my opion."
2,Heh,"This band just isn't the same without John Nolan...The only song that stuck with me on this album was the last one, though Bonus Mosh Pit Pt.2 almost reminded me of what they used to be. The rest of the songs on the CD fall under pop-punk, not well-thought out emo.Save your money if you already have the first CD.p.s: the person in the spotlight review was ""surprised"" by the fact there was a slow song on this album. makes you wonder if they even listened to the first CD...Ghost Man On Third?"
2,Where I Didn't Really Want To End Up,"I find it hard to believe that the band that released this album is the same one who made 'Tell All Your Friends'. I realize that there was a bit of a line-up change in the band, but c'mon...this album pretty much blows completely and verges on totally sucking. The songs aren't catchy and are just all around not good. This is the most disappointed I've been about an album in a long time.My advice: don't waste your money on this, just put in 'Tell All Your Friends' for the hundredth time and listen to it again instead. You'll be much happier."
3,Pretty good follow-up album from TBS,"I absolutley loved the first album (tech. the 2nd album) from Taking Back Sunday. I would say, they certainly changed and progressed nicely as a band. The CD features harder rocking sounds, and more screaming. Newly added Fred (bass) has a unchanny scream which no other vocalist can match, which is the best part of the album. If you want a good CD, buy this one. If you want a fantastic CD, buy Tell All Your Friends."
4,Don't Expect Tell All Your Friends!! Good Group Good Album,"The album ""Tell All Your Friends"" is a great album and if get into the music and lyric style of T.B.S then you will also get into ""Where You Want To Be."" I recommend not purchasing the cd if you are expecting to hear the first album again. ""Where You Want To Be"" has more great tunes by T.B.S. Their music isn't for everyone. Yeah, it probably doesn't make the Mtv reviews but then again when did Mtv start caring about music again. The songs This Photograph is Proof, A Decade Under The Influence, New American Classic, Number Five With A Bullet are just some great tunes."
3,not nearly as good as tell all your friends,"i think taking back sunday was trying to duplicate their debut on this album by recruiting new guitarist and backup singer fred mascherino. he tries so hard to be john nolan it's painful. this is still a decent effort, but its much more watered-down and radio freindly than tell all your friends. buy that instead."
4,Not tell all your friends but good,"Well tell all your friends was just one of those rare albums that had amazing songs on it. I could listen to that cd over and over again and never get bored. Even though TBS lost two members they are still a powerhouse in the punk scence.Though it is not as good as the last cd it still has some really good songs such as ""Set phasers to stun"" and ""Bonus Mosh pt. II"". My favorite song is ""New American Classic"", that song is amazing and you can see the maturation from the last cd to this cd. Overall it is a good cd and worth the money and I would highly recommend this cd to anyone who just likes good music in general."
3,great disappointments of the 21st century,"after one listen to ""where you want to be"", it's obvious tbs has lost their edge. songs like ""set phasers to stun"" and ""number five with a bullet"" are somewhat reminiscent of tracks from their first release ""tell all your friends"", but the remainder of the cd is disappointing to fans who cherished their debut album. the tracks on the albums align almost perfectly, which almost makes it seem that the boys knew they couldn't top ""tell all your friends"", but they figured they could still squeeze out a few catchy, worthwhile tracks to trya and show everyone that they're still breathing. reguardless, it's still a worthy buy, but don't expect tbs to break into anything nearly as great as ""blue channel"" or ""timberwolves at new jersey""."
5,This CD Rocks!,"Taking Back Sunday will not dissapoint a single fan with their follow up of 2002's Tell All You're Friends. While Where you Want to Be does present a diffrent sound, it is still very much Taking Back Sunday, and proves their skills as musicians. Each and every song is amazing, and you can definitley tell the band took their time to produce the best album possible. I also had the opportunity to see them in concert and meet them last week, and they were awesome! I just want to give a big THANK YOU to each of the band's members for working hard to give us something truly great to listen to!"
4,Perfect Album By All Means,"After reading reviews on my own, describing this album, I finally bought it and was impressed with what it had to offer. A girl punk rock fan of fifteen, I found this to be a mixture of so many different sounds, yet defining punk culture well. TBS is one of the most awesome bands, and my friends also agreed. It's definitely worth the purchase. Ok, so, it just completely rocks! Uh, I'm supposed to be researching school information, so, uh, I have to go. :)"
5,Listen to this a few..,"Man...wasnt a big fan of tell all your friends..sure...I liked Cute without the E..great romances..and youre so last summer...But...This album...changed my thoughts on the whole ""emo"" scene...Phasers to stun was the reason i bought it..great song..but as I listened to more of it..its an amazing albums..one of the few you can listen to for years and not get sick of it...The song i recommend...you may not like it at first..but the best song on here by far..is ""slowdance on the inside""..its cool stuff...listen to it...over and over again..."
4,"TBS *almost* successfully avoid the ""Sophomore Slump""","It's usually a pretty common thing for a band to get stuck in the ""sophomore slump"" as the difficulty in making a second album as great as the first is called. Taking Back Sunday definitely made an almost successful attempt. Unfortunately for them, in the previous year they lost two very important band members: John Nolan and Shaun Cooper. Fred M. tries to supply equivocating back-up vocals to John Nolan's, but he just can't pull it off like Nolan. Adam Lazzera is still fronting his little heart out, but his vocals have lost quite a bit of edge. The instrumentals have lost edge as well, and it appears that Taking Back Sunday are in the beginnings of selling out their sound to what is ""popular"" today.Nevertheless, I give ""Where You Want To Be"" some credit based on exceptional lyrics. I'm also allowing some space for the loss of the greatest back-up vocalist in the world--John Nolan. That's why the second TBS album gets only FOUR stars."
2,Jebus Christ why did they let John Nolan leave?,"Taking back Sunday lets everyone down. Their first album ""tell all your friends"" is probably one of the best albums I have ever heard and will remain in my playlist. ""Where you want to be"" wants to be back on eBay where I got it. TBS lost their heart and sound when they lost John Nolan. His backup vocals were always incredible. Their new sound with out him is a turn for the worst. I'm sorry I never saw the real TBS play live (adam just had to crack his hip). WIthout JOhn Nolan taking back sunday is taking back friday too. What is there to look forward to in the week now? Check out www.straylightrun.com JOhn's new band"
2,Horrible,Terrible compared to the old album and Straylight Run's debut. You can tell that John Nolan was a big part of the band that was lost. Save your money!
2,Weaksauce,"comon guys i looked at all the reveiws and everyone thinks this album is so great... what so great about it it sounds like tell all your friends... and talks about the same crap ... they need more creativity, to me this is a step backwards for taking back .. dont get me wrong the cd is alrite but you cant just keep repeating yourself they need to mature into there own style ...my opinion Peace"
2,What happened??,"Where did the Taking Back Sunday that I loved go? I had such high expectations for this cd... but as most of you know, it never amounted to much. Tell all your friends, this cd isn't as good as ""Tell all your friends"" and listening to it isn't where I want to be<sigh> oh well, guess I have to wait 'till their 3rd release..."
3,not exactly where i wanted to be,"i'll say it, taking back sunday is great. they have catchy riffs, and awesome lyrics, but i would rather them go on the track of tell all your friends instead of this. some of the songs are good but some of them aren't. but they do play all of them great live though (whether they're bad or good.KEY SONGS: BONUS MOSH PT.II, LITTLE DEVOTIONAL, ...SLOWDANCE ON THE INSIDE"
1,Face it Emo is horrible.,"Emo is the worst thing since disco. Face it, bad drums, bad bass, horrid guitar. Name me one Emo guitar legend. You can't. Anyone that had their heart broken could have written these abysmal lyrics. Back to the album, my friend has it and he also agrees its bad. He let me listen to it and by the time it ended, I was apauled that this is where music is standing today. So why don't you go buy some Led Zeppelin and let the true Rock heroes show you how its done. And maybe after you Emo kids are done crying, you should throw this album away and your tight clothes."
3,"not tell your friends, but okay","this cd isnt tell your friends at all...but a few good songs, like ""this Photograph is Proof, (I know you Know)"" and ""the Union"" are good. But i just cant get into the other songs, there just not catchy at all. i would say if your a die hard taking back sunday fan, go ahead by all means buy this cd, but if your just looking for a good cd to buy this isnt for you..long live rock...rap is terrible"
3,.,Worse than Tell All Your Friends.Better than Louder Now.Tell All Your Friends being AMAZING.Louder Now being kind of lame.That's all you need to know.You have it or you don't.
2,I very much dislike this record,"Before I begin, I would like to make clear that I really Like Taking Back Sunday. Their first cd is absolutely fantastic. One of my all time favorites. But this cd... I can barely even tolerate it, at best. The only reason I am giving it two stars is because I like the first two tracks. To me, the loss of John Nolan severely hurt TBS.This cd is full of honest to goodnes pop-punk. To be honest, I actually like Louder Now more than this record. Songs such as ""A decade under the influence"" really dont cut it when compared to classics like ""Timberwolves at New Jersey"" and ""No 'I' in team.""And maybe it's just me, but I think that ""Number Five with a Bullet"" basically is just a retread of ""You are so Last Summer."" But that is just me.-peace"
2,It's just not the same without Nolan and Cooper.,"I am a huge taking back sunday fan, so of course to popular belief, I was excited to see the new cd on the shelves. I picked it up and listened to it in the car. It gave me a headache. I figured since that I get carsick often that I should just listen to it when I got home. It was dissapointing. The songs are repetitive. The only thing that was really a pain to listen to were the vocals. Yeah okay, Adam was still there, but it just felt a little odd with Fred. He tried, but its just not the same. This is my opinion. I want to sell the cd or throw it away. I just like Set Phasers To Stun. Thats All. Buy yourself a comfy pair of flip flops instead of the CD. You'll get lots more use out of it."
3,I got a bad feeling about this...,":-/Tell All Your Friends is Gospel.This CD isn't for these reasons:-A lot of the songs don't make sense to me--the lyrics seem to lack effort..they could just hum to the beat and the CD probably would be just as effective for me.-Fred isn't as good as Jon, though he tries to bite his style. But, I'll throw him some dap for having a tough act to follow.I listened to the CD three times hoping it'd grow on me, but it still doesn't do anything for me.Still the elements are there...catchy songs...like repetitive (soft scream..louder now..) (i know you didn't mean it..i know you know...!) (ive got a bad feeling bout this) eh, i gave it a generous three because Tell All Your Friends is such a good CD and I knew they couldn't follow it with something as good, though Brand New did with Deja Entendu, which is actually better than your Favorite Weapon, which I was surprised they could improve on such an amazing album..so..im rambling..peace."
4,great,this cd isnt my favorite of TBS's but it was definitely the one that got me into the band in the first place. a lot of the songs are really great like the opening track and a decade under the influence. i love fred's addition to the band and i wish he was still a member because he complimented adam really well. overall this cd is great and reminds me of a lot of great memories.
2,Taking back this album to the store..,"OK, so maby I'm not really returning this album..another beer coaster couldn't hurt, right? I picked this album up after hearing ""Set phasers to stun"" and ""a decade under the influence"" on the radio, which I should have realized that is exactly what this band is: radio pop rock for teenage angst. The singles on this album keep me from giving it 1 star, but I still give two grudgingly. If you enjoy the emo/screamo or whatever this genre is, then you will probably like this album. Otherwise, don't bother."
3,sending back sunday,"this album is O.K. dont get me wrong, i know all the lyrics and jam with friends but nothing compares to the 1st album, 'tell all your friends'. NOTHING. and nothing ever will. not feeling the new members. john nolan and sean cooper obviously were the brains of tbs cause their (sort of) new band, STRAYLIGHT RUN, is one of my favorite bands. now the 3rd tbs album. TRAIN WRECK. adam lazzara... SELL OUT."
4,comon guys,"maybe i was expecting too much out of them after their amazing first album, ""Tell All Your Friends"" because i was dissapointed, it wasnt terrible, but it wasnt as good as their previous album, they just arent the same TBS as they were with their old voice, still has some good songs, none as good as Cute without the E tho...o well....maybe next year..."
4,OK,"This is a pretty solid, good album. The sound is somewhat changed from Tell All Your Friends, but it still sounds like good old TBS. I liked the first one, and I like the second. I say go for it if you have some extra money lying around."
4,A job well done,"Not bad TBS...listen people, you are either gunna hate this CD or love it. Just like the band itself. I for one am a fan of Taking Back Sunday, i mean where do they go wrong? They dont sound all that bad and their new album may not be as aggresive as TAYF but it certianly has some quality tunes. I'm not gonna sit here and waste my time rating every song but this CD in my opinion deserves 4 stars. Not as upstanding as the first CD but a job well done. if u like TBS than get out and check this album out. I for one will be listening to this for the next month. Also check out Atreyu's The Curse. Another maturing band that will continue to succeed in the music industry along with TBS"
3,I MISS JOHN,I am changing this review...It's still 3 stars but It's a good flow all the way through...but nowhere near the quality of Tell All Your FriendsBuy Straylight Run's Debut CD in SEPTEMBER!
1,Band lost most of its talent...,"... when John Nolan and Shaun left for Straylight Run. There is no variation from TAYF to WYWTB. TAYF was unique but WYWTB leaves much to be desired. Fred from Breaking Pangea brings absolutely nothing to TBS and Adam is a stuttering mess without the creativity and brilliance of John Nolan. Also, Adam could easily be replaced with any hobo from the streets of NYC. Tell all your friends NOT to buy this album."
1,PPPHHHHFFFFFFFFFFFFLLLLLLUUUUUUTTTTT!!!!!!,"Why does this singer sound like soooooooooooo many other singers in new bands out now? That whiney, snotty, off-key frat-punk style of ""singing"" has got to go! Who buys this do-do? Someone does because it obviously pays to become yet another copy of this sound. I blame Blink-182, the original snotty, annoying, frat-wanna-be-punk vocal. What was Robert Smith drinking when he agreed to record with them? Of course, the Cure has become a shadow of what they once were anyway. Like so many others, Blink jumped the Green Day bandwagon. Green Day jumped bandwagons too, but they came up with pretty much their own sound that so many tried to copy. At least it's not emo!"
1,hORRIBLE,"this cd is a total sellout cd.there old cd was grade a emo punk. now all they are is a pop punk band that should either quit or find there own ""identity"" do me a favor review writers check out there old cd if you want to see some good roots emo - punk."
1,I love watching Everybody Love's Raymond on TBS!,"OMG, LOL that guy in their song totally looks like Fight Club. I wish I could meet that guy, Fight Club, because I would bet he would teach me all about his philosophy on life and fight with me. But I would not hit him as hard as I could because I might hurt him and he has a pretty face. Then me and him, we would go to the bar and talk about soap, and about girls while this music played in the background and we'd feel sad about how dames are so cruel, and they just want to go out with the jock and bone him and don't want me because my hair is dyed black, and they can't deal with my realness. So, then Fight Club would tell me about his philosophy, and I'd be so floored by its realness and I'd adopt it, because it is the most brilliant philosophy ever because they made a movie about it, I think it was called Fight Club, in honor of my friend."
1,Nails on the chalkboard,"This band has the most overwhelmingly EXCRUTIATING vocals I have ever had the misfortune of hearing. There are layers and layers and layers of infinitely weak and annoying whining, yelping, and laughable attempts at screaming.Even with bearable vocals, awful songwriting and even worse lyrics would warrant this album a one-star rating.Buy a Rites of Spring, Fugazi, or Morrissey album instead."
1,what trash,any band with a season or month in their name needs to be put to death. taking back fall out autumns sunday november boy need to stop. they will never be weezer or sunny day real estate and they need to realize this. only fat girls with no friends listen to this garbage.
1,Taking Back Sunday can take a flying leap off a short pier,TAKING BACK SUNDAY SUCK. I HATE THIS BAND AND ANYONE WHO LIKES THEM.THEY SHOULD HAVE THEIR BRAINS SURGICALLY REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH ANOTHER BANDS SO THEY COULD WRITE MUSIC THAT DOESN'T SUCK SO MUCH.SOMETIMES WHEN I FEEL FRUITY I PUT ON MY GIRLY PANTS AND MY PINK THRIFT-STORE T-SHIRT ON THEN I WOULD LIKE TO LISTEN TO THIS.THEN I REALIZE WHAT AN IDIOT I'M BEING AND THAT I'M SELLING OUT MY MANHOOD SO I PUT ON A THRICE OR A DEATH BY STEREO RECORD ON AND REMEMBER THAT THERE STILL IS GOOD IMO-CORE OUT THERE.0 STARS IS MORE LIKE IT
1,"Another Trendy Hot Topic band, and yes... another 1 star","Why people listen to this , or actually buy it? I have no clue.Is it because MTV shoves this junk down every kids throat? is it beacuse hot topic says it is cool?Whatever reason, its just noise.This CD goes great with your WORTHLESS collection of OLD TRENDS like blink 182, n sync, spice girls, linkin park, limp bizkit, Good Charlotte, and other emo/hardcore garbage."
1,Another corpse to add to the list...,"You know a band must truly suck when they sound worse then Dashboard Confessional.There,I said it."
1,"The one star goes to ""Decade Under the Influence""","The only reason I even would give this cd one star is because Decade is a kind of catchy song. That's all. All of the other songs on the cd are either boring or annoying. And a few of them get both nominations. To tell the truth, they all sound pretty much the same. Except for when TBS tries to make a ""slow"" song, and it ends up being five minutes of boring, gut wrenching noise. If you listen to Taking Back Sunday, you're probably one of the MTV/Hot Topic crowd. There just isn't good music anymore."
2,boring,"i really liked taking back sunday, but ""where you want to be"" put me to sleep. the only good songs on here are 'Set Phasers To Stun' 'A decade under the influence'and 'number five with a bullet' and even they are just average. the others are so bland and you cant listen to them for more then thirty seconds without getting bored. there's nothing too special about the vocals either. i was so disapointed because 'tell all your friends' was such a great album,""where you want to be"" is no comparison. however i wasnt completley pissed off at myself for buying this because inside there was a bonus sampler cd from victory records with songs from Atreyu, Hawthorne Heights, Bayside and Silverstein[all very good] so it was worth the $8 i payed on sale"
2,Not where I want to be at all.,"This must have been the thought when starting this band, ""We all like Thursday and Saves the Day, lets combine both of their styles, it will be great."" I thought their first album was fun, but this cd is just boring. I have had the cd for about a week and just can't get into it. I guess this is what happens when the main songwriter leaves the band. Or it might be becasue every other band right now has this exact same style. The only good thing about this cd is the lyrics aren't as bad and cliche as the last."
3,Extremely Disapointing,"I've been with TBS since the beginning, and it's really sad to see such an underwhelming second album. It doesn't even come close to touching the first in any respects, except possibly for the brilliant ""A Decade Under the Influence"", which alone gives the record three Stars."
4,Pretty Good follow-up to TAYF- Transnasty,"This is a pretty good CD and it has quite a few good songs like this photograph is proof.This album is definatly not as good as their first because that CD rules the world.Overall, good followup and should be boughten"
3,At The Drive In ANYBODY!!?,"I gotta say, I had a baaaaaaaad feeling before I checked this album out. Then I did, and while I heard alot of the pussy punk rock that I was expecting, these guys are tight and play very decent music. That doesn't make it original however and I reckon the best description is half-way between At The Drive In and Blink 182! I can understand where the MTV moaners are coming from, but I'm siding with the fans on this one because there's alot worse music out there and fair play to these boyos, they're putting their hearts in to it! Buy if you like Counting Crows!"
3,where you want to be,"I think this taking back sunday cd is good but not better than the first but it's different maybe because they lost some members of there band but hopefully the next one will be betterbut I still like the cd.My favorite songs are the photograph is proof(i know you),one eighty by the summer,and number five with a bullet."
2,"Still goto their shows, but skip this album...","...because it isn't that good. it sounds over-produced, and i don't hear much variety in the music. also, tell all your friends had a lot more feeling and thought in the lyrics (relative to the genre, at least).having seen them before and after this album, however, i can vouch for the continuing coolness of TBS live. check them out if you get a chance!"
5,Why do you have to be challenged?,"Everyone that has posted a negative review has stated something about either the band not being as good as before, or about how it didn't make them think. Do you need your music to make you think? Are you incapable of thinking on your own? Why can't this cd be good music. If you dislike it for the reason of it being bad to you, then ok. But don't hate on TBS for being different, it'll happen when you get new members.ANYWAY, this is a great cd for anyone who likes and appreciates emo. It changes tempos a lot, and the lyrics are great, if a bit hard to catch at times. Part of TBS's appeal is that if you've seen them live, you'll appreciate their music a lot more. I've seen them twice, so I can take each song and reference it to a live performance. Even if you haven't seen them live, though, you should listen to this cd, it's as lyrically deep a cd as you'll find out there.Personal Favs: Bonus Mosh Pt. II, New American Classic"
4,"It's pretty good, I'll admit.","I can't believe no one's reveiwed this already. Oh well, on with it. Okay, I have to say it, and I know you all already know it - it's not as good as Tell All Your Friends. But if you stop thinking about its inferiority, it's actually a pretty good album. It has a much brighter feel, I think, than the other one, and some of the tracks (one being my personal favorite, One Eighty By Summer) are pure, unadulterated Taking Back Sunday. The only thing - three of the original members are gone, and usher in the newbies. I have no problem with them, except that I miss the screaming of John Nolan, and of course the raw feel the first album had, but what are you gonna do. It's a good cd. If you're at least a little open-minded and you liked Tell All Your Friends, you'll probably enoy it. I do."
2,I wanted to like it,"I really did. Its half the cd that tell all your friends is. The raw emotion is not the same. Plus they do a ballad? Give me a break, they might as well be poison. Not even a ballad that eventually rocks, a straight up ballad. TBS has jumped the shark.---update. After several more listens I actually like this one more but I still like the first on better"
3,Inconclusive results,"I use the Arnica salve/lotion...and truly believe it helps (sport strains, aches/pins). But cannot really say I've experienced any real benefit from the tabs. Will contnue to try. But for time being, good old ibuprophen is the quick relief."
2,"Sorry, didn't get it.","Exactly what makes this such a great work, or, according to one edition I saw, among the 100 greatest ""novels"" of the century?I listened to the book on tape and could barely keep my attention focused. What I heard was a deadly dull collection of character studies and vignettes exposing the not-so-scandalous secret thoughts of some small town people. Certainly it had a few moments, but none of the stories ever resolved themselves or built up any significant narrative tension. Even the language wasn't particularly inventive or evocative. Characters were introduced, thinly sketched, and then left the stage - sort of like ""Cats"" without the music.I'm neither a lowbrow reader nor overly culture-bound, but these voices from the distant heartland simply didn't speak to me."
4,My hometown in 1919,"Winesburg, Ohio was written by Sherwood Anderson about a small town in Ohio. Not the town now known as Winesburg, Ohio, but another smalltown called Clyde, Ohio.I read this book in 9th grade & I could recognize some of the places in the book. They are still there in my hometown."
3,A nice piece of sentimental fiction.,"Anderson was a master of short fiction and he shows it in this volume, a series of interwoven stories depicting life in Middle America. It is a period piece. Over-exaggerated characters are colorful on the inside rather than out and express the isolation they feel effectively. Of course most of the characters, at least potentially, are too extraordinary for their environment, but I suppose that's more exciting than a reverse exaggeration of Midwest halfwits, which is more likely to be documented."
4,The Truth,"First and foremost this book is not a collection of short stories, but rather a novel based on a boy growing up in small town America. However, this town is like no ordarny town, it is full of people made grotesque by the truth of their own past. An eye opening account of human sexual desire and the truths that haunt us all."
3,OK...3 plus stars,"This little book is still required reading in many Lit courses. It's well written, but I have a few problems with it. First of all, it's fairly obvious that he thought most of us from rural Ohio were a bunch of nincompoops...or, gnarled apples. Secondly, the religious nut guy in the field was a stretch and, perhaps, downright ridiculous. So much has been read into this book that it has become overwrought. Everyone should read this, but not necessarily believe it."
3,Not bad....but a classic?,"I read this book as part of a course on 20th century American fiction. Now I realize I really don't know what small town Ohio was like in the early part of the 20th century, but surely it wasn't all like this. Every story/character was desperate and pathetic. Almost no characters had any redeeming features...except maybe the young reporter for the Winesburg paper. I thought some of the chapters were fantastic...like the chapter about the doctor, the young woman patient who became his wife and the balls of paper in his lab coat. But for the most part I found it depressing, hopeless, stiffling....and I am forever grateful that I don't live there."
2,"bizarre, depressing","I have read this book and yet I am still trying to figure out what the author was trying to get across. The bookd just left me with a somewhat depressed, glad-it-is-over feeling. I grew up in a small town in ohio and yes, there are some weirdos there just like any other town or city, no more no less. With that in mind, I did not get any kind of a ""message"" from the book--unless it would be to avoid small Ohio towns because of the weirdos. The book was not written in an enjoyable, entertaining fashion, so I don't think entertainment was the intent. As for being a ""social commentary"" on the times or a ""snapshot"" of Ohio history--I surely hope not--this town is out of the norm, not a representation of it. This book is just a schizophrenic collection of rather bizarre, boring people with no philosophical or historical point, no entertainment, no social commentary, not even amateur ""reporting"". Strange."
4,Great Example of Revolt Against the Village,"Winesburg is a great novel depicting the genre of Revolt agaist the village. Anderson makes you feel as if you are young George Willard, the main character in the novel."
5,"Winesburg, amazing","I am only 17 years old, but I've read a lot of books. I want to tell everybody out there that Winesburg, Ohio by Sherwood Anderson is, by far, the best I've read so far. We were required to read it for an advanced english class and every student in the class was ""wowed"" by the depth of Anderson's book. I strongly recomend this book for any high school, or college, class; or book club. I feel that the only way to read this book is in a group so each chapter can be discussed and studied. This is not a book for those looking for an easy-reader. This is for those of you who will catch the small things (Who's a grotesque? Who's not? Are they twisted apples? Note the motifs of hands, light and dark, adventure. In which chapters are there allusion to greek myths? To The Bible?) I strongly recomend this book to anyone who has lost faith in the thoughfullness of writers today. The book will wow you, but only if you can figure it out."
4,A beautiful piece of work,"This book is difficult to get into, but keep reading. The poetry of the language, particularly in the middle and end of the book is lovely. The book captures the loneliness of the individual and the need for companionship. Our book group had a wonderful discussion of the book."
5,Book on Demand,"Wineburg, Ohio was just as I wanted it: brand new, no marks, slim edition, lightweight and small. And it arrived at my house from Amazon in just a few days. I couldn't be happier.Sue Hatem"
2,Strange editing,"This edition of ""Winesburg, Ohio"" was edited in a very bizzare manner. It seemed as though the text from another edition was brought over and simply pasted to this edition, which caused words to be hyphenated in the middle of paragraphs. In other words, what seemed to happen was where a word that might have been at the end of a line in one previous edition was now positioned in the middle of a line, but it was still hyphenated as it had been. This was very distracting and after the second page I had to stop reading, because the hyphen-ation was break-ing words that should not have been bro-ken and, in effect, alter-ing the em-phasis and meaning of the text. Very shoddy editing."
2,Inconsequential,"Take the simplicity of William Saroyan but omit the charm. Take the sparse imagery of Robert Frost but omit the poetry. Take the kaleidoscopic view of small town America of Edgar Lee Masters but omit the humanity. And there you have Anderson's Winesburg. There is no elegance in his style and no consequence in his narrative. He seeks to reveal Middle America with a series of vignettes but the result is a frustrating, meandering journey to Nowhere, Ohio."
2,"Desultory, Depressing, Dismal","I really had to force myself to plow through ""Winesburg, Ohio,"" and it's only a little over 200 pages to begin with. I can't remember a book that depressed me more, except perhaps for ""Tobacco Road,"" and at least that book was leavened with some humour.""Winesburg, Ohio"" is a series of loosely connected stories, each one centering on a different inhabitant of this small Mid-Western village. In a nutshell, all of the characters are lonely for one reason or another, all make attempts to reach out to others for some solace and/or emotional companionship, and all fail miserably. Sherwood Anderson's writing is flat and airless, never varied, and the whole enterprise sinks under the weight of its own monotony.I give this book two stars instead of one because I'm feeling particularly generous today and because Anderson's writing did seem to greatly influence the course of the American short story. Read away if unbroken despondence is your bag; otherwise, pass this one by."
1,A Waste of Money at ANY price,"Typical of many of his generation (the much-vaunted and even more overrated ""Lost Generation""), Anderson is a cross between Pathetic and just plain Weird, and the psuedo-intellectuals who termed his work ""literature"" were mostly just self-absorbed fools. ""Winesburg, Ohio is just a poor joke."
2,A Flawed Book,"The easy acceptance and apparent approval of cruelty to animals ruin an adequate book. The Orthodox Church does not teach or approve of cruelty to anything. It is humanity's role to bring everything closer to God, not to spread pain and suffering.I find this acceptance especially disturbing in light of current research which shows cruelty to animals in childhood is a precursor to cruelty to humans in adulthood.Also, the Orthodox Church does not say animals ""have no soul"". The Church Fathers say they have a soul but it is not the same as the enhanced human soul.Inquiries can be better served by such standards as ""The Orthodox Church"" by Timothy Ware, and ""The Spiritual Life and How to be Attuned to It"" by St. Theophan the Recluse."
4,Excellent,"I got to know Johnny Winter in the 1980's, through his Alligator albums like Guitar Slinger and his late Muddy Waters productions likeHard Again. It was not until much later that I found out he had done a more rockified blues in the 1970's, when people cared less about genres and a wide range of genres could reach the same audience.Saints and Sinners is one of those 1970's album. It has more than its share of blues, even if that blues is in the subtext, sporting more than I IV V changes. The production is geared more towards 1970a rock, polished, some tracks even featuring Memphis style backing vocals.Thus I got to know Johnny Winter, the rock star, which only raises my already lofty opinion of him. As usual, his guitar work is amazing, and if I had not heard the 1980's albums first, I would still rate Winter one of the giants of post-Cream, post-Mayall, post-1960's blues."
3,Guitar playing and songwriting not up to snuff for Winter,"This recording is not a dog by any means.However there are better blues rock recordings by Johnny Winter that contain more superb songwriting and vibrant guitar playing to spend your money on.Such blues rock recordings by Winter include the bookends of this recording ""Still alive and well"" and ""John Dawson Winter III"", as well as ""And ... Live"", ""Captured Live"", ""White Hot and Blue"", ""Winter of 88""In using a 10 star rating; for a blues rock recording, it would get 8/10.For a Winter blues rock recording it gets a 5.5/10"
3,cool,so for a costume they are a great add.. they come off easily when i speak...and they look more real in the picture than they do in real life
4,Good for people with big mouths!,"I have a smallish mouth, and these didn't look as subtle as I wanted them to- if you want something subtle, try the Sweetheart fangs by Scarecrow. However, they stayed in great, and I'm still using them years later. They were fairly comfortable to wear and didn't come loose unless I wiggled them. They are definitely very prominent- I wanted something that would show up when I smiled, but these were so big in my mouth that I had to bare my teeth for the whole ""vampire fang"" effect- otherwise the bottom part of the fang was below my lower lip."
4,Nice Fangs,"Well, there's not much to say other than I love these! The only problem you might have with it though is once the plastic hardens, you can't melt it like the other kinds to fix it if you make a mistake in fitting it on."
3,"This Christmas, here is Frank Sinatra","This is a collection of Christmas songs by Young Blue Eyes, by his first record label, Columbia. Sinatra certainly had a good voice, but he hadn't quite developed the great phrasing that he later became famous for. Also, the arrangements of the songs aren't really all that interesting. For some reason, a lot of the songs are alternate takes, instead of the master takes. There is also a ""V-Disc"" and three songs performed live on the radio. This is a decent enough collection, but Sinatra's later Christmas recordings are better."
2,Nice but slow,"It is a younger Frank who is hitting all the right notes. However, the songs are generally slower songs and it seems like the tempo of the songs is just a little off. It almost feels like there is a lack of energy. Even Jingle Bells is slower than other artists do it. There are two swinging tunes in the middle. There is also interesting introductions which are amusing. Overall, though, I was hoping for a more interesting CD."
3,get down 2nite!!!,"my mom loves this cd. she plays it in the middle of july, check that out. the sound quality is lacking but it is still frank. check out the hidden track with ja rule"
4,Gin Rose,"This is a great cd. After 30 years not playing together, Klaus Schulze and Manuel Gottsching play a sweet show at London's Royal Festival Hall. This is electronic music at its best, taking the talent of two of the biggest names in this musical genre.The reason I like this release so much is that these two musicians have the highest talent in music improvisation. The 61 minutes of music on this cd are really well done.A must have for any seasoned music collection or for the already Ash Ra fan.3 1/2 *"
3,Ash Ra Tempel - 'Gin Rose:Live' (Manikin Records) 3 1/2 stars,"A reunion some fans, including myself never thought would happen. A one off show (was it?) that after nearly thirty years two early Ash Ra Tempel members, Manuel Gottsching and Klaus Schulz played a gig at the Royal Festival Hall in London, of all places. One track here, just one - with a duration of 69 minutes. The music progresses and it often settles. A decent effort, but personally, I liked their 'Friendship' effort better (see my review). Takes a little getting used to."
1,Disappointed,"Has nothing to do with Jet Li's usual movies. The plot is silly, just like the fighting scenes. Jet Li acts an Indiana Jones like character. The only reason to buy this movie is to complete the Jet Li's collection that someone might have."
2,Disappointing,"As an ecology student, I expected a sound scientifically written ecology and management tool. Although some selected studies were quoted, this book appears to have a political agenda. Every section has a ""and here's why doves should be hunted"" swing which I found to be annoying."
4,YOU HAVE TO GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!,"this game is great! you get to pick through a bunch of Wrestlers like the Doink The Clown,The Undertaker,Razor Ramon,Shawn Michaels,Bret The Hitman Hart,Bam Bam Bigelow, and more.You also get to play with your friends in a tag team match and you could play by yourself against the computer. There are also allot of wrestling rings you could pick through with diferent environments and the graphics are great the guys look like real people and there is a bunch of moves for each guys even there signature moves!.This game also teaches you how to use the Playstation alot better because you have to use different combinations of buttons to do a wrestling move.You have to get this game i have it for a long time allready and it dosent get boring if you could pick one game to buy pick WWF In Your House."
1,THIS GAME SUCKS!,"LIKE I SAID THIS GAME DOES NOT ONLY SUCK!BUT IT SHOULD BE SOLD FOR 5 DOLLARS.THE GRAPHICS ARE ALRIGHT BUT IT IS NOT REALISTIC AT ALL!IF U WANT A REAL GAME DONT WASTE UR MONEY ON WRESTLING GAMES BUY SILENT HILL OR RESIDENT EVIL,OR IN MY OPINION BUY SPORTS OR RACING GAMES!UM...THATS ABOUT ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS."
1,"This game was worth a 1,000 dollars.","All right first off this game can go to hell. Second why isn't Stone Cold Steve Austin in it. Or the Peoples Champion, or DX,(well they do have Hunter but you can't do the Pedigree!) The olny good part is that this game has the Heart Break Kik, but once again he does't do the ""Sweet Chin Music"" Is far is the game goes I should open a can of whoop A** on it! This game lacks good people like Gillberg and Savio Vega. no but really there is no Badd A** Billy Gunn, no Road Dogg. I mean this game is missing everything that makes a game good. Like weapons. This game would be good if it had Mr.Vin'man. If you smell what I am cokkin. And it's missing those rich snobs the Mean Street Pussy I mean Posse. Plus no Sable."
2,Can you say Mortal Kombat.,"This is so a mortal kombat type game the only thing i like is warrior being in it and undertakers graveyard fatality besides that this game .... Go buy mortal Kombat 1,2,3,4,gold,trilogy etc. This is worse that all those. By the way I dont like MK alot but sometimes its cool."
5,Excellent product!,I've used CarboPro for about 9 months now and wouldn't use anything else. Tasteless and goes into any drink. Great even in plain water. Taking it on our next Grand Canyon rim-to-rim because it's easy to carry and put into the Camelbak.
4,Good compilation of workouts,"This is a combo of some of her older workouts (very obvious from the set styles and video quality), but it's a great value versus purchasing the workouts separately. The one mile is a good quick one and the other three are all 30 minutes. I purchased it mainly for the Walk Strong workout, she doesn't have many where she uses free weights and I like to combine the strength training and cardio, but I also really like having a 30 minute workout with jogging intervals, since a lot of her fast ones are longer."
3,Walk Away the Pounds,"I really enjoy the Walk at Home DVDs. I highly recommend them. However, I was once again a little disappointed in that some of the walks were already on other DVDs I already had in my collection. The two that I didn't have though make a great addition."
1,save your money,"This dvd is terrible. I can't believe I paid 14.99 for it. The picture is terribly distorted, and the set is very distracting and annoying. I can't stand to watch it. I wish I could return it. 5 Day Slim Down is a much better choice."
5,Wife loves using it.,"I bought this DVD, but my wife uses it. I guess the test of a good product is does it get used or not. In this case, the answer is yes. She likes the ability to do workouts that are as long or as short as she has the time for, and she likes that they are at home.I've watched the DVD while she works out to it. Leslie has a down home style and is easy to listen to. She gives encouraging pep talk the whole time. She does have a quirkly laugh, but that's part of the fun, I guess. Anyway we now own quite a few of these DVD's. So 5 stars."
3,Old Workout Beware,"I was very disappointed when I started this workout. It is older workouts, the music doesn't come through loud enough for me to be able to keep up with the beat. The intensity just isn't there for me at all. I feel like I wasted my money. I wish I would have read the reviews here before I purchased it. I have at least 7 of her DVD's and this one I won't use very often at all."
4,NOT COMPATIBLE,"Great service, again... However, would've liked to know the DVD required a special, North American system compatible DVD/CD player. I will have to find to find one now which won't be easy.."
5,Love This CD,This is a good exercise video and easy for beginners and great for experienced exercisers. You feel really good after this workout.
4,Good Workout,"No fancy footwork required, but if you keep up, you will get a good cardio workout. There's 3 separate workouts so you can alternate between them. Might want to keep this one for when you want to get it done, but don't want to tie yourself in a knot or bounce around alot."
5,Best of year!,"Can't over-emphacize the value of this book; is most important and factually informative have ever read on this whole field. Would be worth hundred times its purchase price. Whole groups of health problems cureable via some of these presently available solutions, or via finalizing/re-instating progress on some of these persecuted paths."
4,mostly great!,I was expecting newer and I felt the circa date was not in the list?? Besides that I love it .
4,One of the best of the early Seventies,"It was here that Nilsson must have heard the emotive and beautiful song, ""Without You,"" and it is on NO DICE that the song gets its best interpretation ever. Badfinger does it the justice it deserves, their emphasis bestowing a degree of sorrow that Nilsson missed. True to the Beatle-like style that they were known for, the album is full of pleasant early-seventies style rockers that makes it enjoyable from start to finish. Their first big hit, ""No Matter What,"" is a great song that hints at what will follow on STRAIGHT UP two years later."
4,"Oh very good indeed,sir !","Quite smashing,ol' bean ! Ripping good stuff,what ? You gotta get this for ""No Matter What"". The rest is the beginnings of power pop that Americans would soon try to emulate.But not with taste like Badfinger."
1,VERY BAD PRINT QUALITY!,"I am a huge Rich Corben fan. But this book looks like it was color xeroxed out of the Eerie and Creepy comic books. The print quality is not just sort of bad, it is TERRIBLE. I assure you, you do not want to buy this cobbled together mess. There is one story in the book that prints some pages in color and some in blurry black and white.I would love to have a good reprint of these stories. They are fantastic. But this print job was shot from the printed comic books and it looks terrible.Please take my word for it. This book is an insult to anyone who collects comic art and its an insult to Rich Corben's work. It's nothing but muddy wreckage.There are a number of great Rich Corben books on Amazon. Try CAGE or the HULK books. Very nice printing. Very good books."
2,"Interesting material, poor print quality","Everything Richard Corben does is interesting. Perhaps the best American graphic artist of the 1970s, his material still has a visceral impact in the new millenium. Those who only know him through his ""Den"" character will see several new dimensions of him in the works contained in this volume. This book contains several black-and-white as well as several color works, varying in quality from fascinating (Hard John Apple - about a post-apocalyptic warrior) to bizarre (Child - about a Frankenstein-like child monster). Always affecting, never ""normal,"" Corben's work deserves as much exposure as possible. This reprint suffers from poor quality but is still worth getting, especially as most Corben work is out of print. Die-hard fans: buy. Others: ???"
4,A funk/rock/psychedelic/soul meltdown!,"Sly is and was a genius, no doubt, with exuberance and groove to spare on every track of this album. Even the filler material (""Chicken,"" ""Dynamite"") is catchy with some interesting production touches, and the better songs that didn't make his Greatest Hits collection are awesome.You may recognize that ""Into My Own Thing"" has a distinctive horn/organ/bass/drum riff - heard today as the predominant sample from the current Fatboy Slim song (the one with Christopher Walken dancing).If you love the alternating lead vocals, fuzz bass, punchy drums and brilliant arrangements of Sly's better known material, it will only take a few listens before these songs are as classic to you as his best. I really like ""Harmony"" (despite the cheesy intro) and ""Jane Is A Groupee"" (killer production)."
2,Little more than a coffee table book,"While this book has beautiful pictures on every other page, and cute little blurbs about doshas and skin care, it is really not a very informative book on ayurvedic skin care. A person who has never heard of ayurveda before may benefit from the basic information in this book, but to anyone who has read another book on ayurveda, this book will be a dissapointment. I much prefered Melanie Sach's book Ayurvedic Beauty Care, or Pratima Raichur's Absolute Beauty, which are both much more in depth. However, if you are looking for a beautiful, interesting looking coffee table or bathroom book, this would be a good choice."
5,The Cambridge Companion to Feminist Literary Theory (Cambridge Companions to Literature),"This is a great book for studying feminist theory. Easy to read selections and interesting critiques on various feminist aspects. The content in this book is very broad, so whether one is looking for African-American feminist theory, lesbian and queer theory, or just feminism in general this book provides a variety of topics that are sure to help any feminist scholar or those who are just interested in feminist theory."
2,The K'iche' Mayan sacred book,"This ""translation"" of the K'iche' Mayan sacred book was not made from the original K'iche' Mayan text but rather it is a weak translation from an early Spanish version based on an even weaker French version. There are many many mistakes. Reader beware!"
5,Timeless piece,I am rediscovering the roots of American classic writers and it has been a wonderful start with Hemingway's short stories. Among the many remarkable points to make about Hemingway's prose is his simple language that illustrates the vividness of his imagery. It is simple and yet very poignant-making his work standout from the rest.I bought this book used and want to especially thank the seller for shipping it so quickly. You were not kidding when you said that you ship fast!
3,"Great writing, terrible editing yet again!","This is the first of Hem's work that I've read and am very impressed with his writing and style. However, as I'm finding to be quite common with kindle editions, the book is riddled with errors. Some quality control please!!!"
5,One of a kind.,"Signature ***1/2)It's hard to write a funny song that isn't just a novelty, but Amy Rigby is a master. Her comically pessimistic, self-deprecatingly ironic songs are as amusing on the 10th listen as they are on the first, in part because she can be as bitter (""Why Do I"") as she is sweet (""Don't Ever Change"").Til The Wheels Fall Off is Rigby's best album since 1996's great Diary of a Mod Housewife. She's randy and rambunctious even as she deals with parenthood and a penchant for unreliable men. In rootsy songs that range from the Tex-Mex title track (a duet with Todd Snider) to the jaunty piano pop of ""The Deal"" to the twangy anthem ""Are We Ever Gonna Have Sex Again?"" (""We used to be triple x-rated/look at us now, so domesticated""), Rigby dissects desires and doubts with vivacity and humor.- Steve KlingePhiladelphia Inquirer"
4,Late nights with NPR,"I first heard of Amy Rigby when she was interviewed by NPR; I was driving along I-80. Her album seemed like the perfect soundtrack to driving alone, at night. She so impressed me with the candor of her songs. I bought this album and have not regretted it in the least. 'Don't Ever Change,' 'Break Up Boots,' and 'Even the Weak Survive' continue to be favorites that I'll listen to on repeat, over and over. Her lyrics are smart, snappy, and insightful. I've always been a sucker for lyrics. Rigby's voice sometimes waxes thin and reedy, but her lyrics more than make up for what might be musically lacking."
4,A wonderful book about an extremely talented guy.,"This was a wonderful book for me to read. In fact, I read it cover to cover the first evening that I had it. It is very informative, and answers alot of questions that I had about Ub Iwerks. I had heard and read alot of stories about him, many filled with alot of contradictions. This book put those contradictions to rest. Ub's relationship with the Disneys was not a strained one, after he returned to the Disney Studio. In fact, he was a lifelong friend of both Walt and Roy. I knew of his work with optical printers and matte photography, but was not aware of all the technical work that he did for Disneyland and Walt Disney World. All in all, a great book. A must for any classic Disney animation fan."
4,Underrated,"Okay, the production does sink this album---too many fake drums, over-distorted guitars, cheesy keyboard sounds, and it sounds like 10 guys together shouting every chorus. BUT, if you can beyond that, the actual songs are really tight on this album. One can't help but think that if these songs were produced in the same manner as London Calling, with more of a timeless, classic rock sound, this album would stand up well in the Clash's discography. As it is, it's seen as an embarassment by most Clash fans. It's a bit sad, because you can see Joe Strummer desperately trying to rekindle the early spirit of the Clash, while at the same time trying to compete with Mick Jones' Big Audio Dynamite project that was using a lot of keyboards and beatboxes. He's not particularly successful at either, but still, his heart and soul and songwriting skills are all over this album, and I think that still makes it better than about 95% of the stuff that came out in 1985."
4,much better than the bad rap it gets,"First of all, you have to get past the fact that Mick Jones and Topper Headon are not on this album. But it's not Strummer's and Semonin's fault that those two were smacked out of their minds. That being said, this is not vingtage 1977 Clash, it is however, a pretty good album. They go in some new directions, although not to the extent as in Sandinista! and the end product is well worth a listen. Joe Strummer made such precious little music that we have to take what we can get.If you are a Clash fan or a Strummer fan, you owe it to yourself to own this album."
1,DON'T BLAME JOE!,"This album isn't indicative of the Clash's talent, nor Joe's. True, Mick was kicked out by manager Bernie Rhoades, and a new group was put together, but after Joe started work on this album, it was taken from his hands. This IS NOT A CLASH RECORD, IT IS A BERNIE RHOADES RECORD. The songs are Joe's, and they aren't all bad. So, do yourself a favor and buy Joe's solo albums if you're looking for post-Mick Clash songs. ""Rock Art and the X-Ray Style"" is excellent!"
1,Complete crap,"This album contains one good song: ""This is England"" and a couple cool riffs. Otherwise, an embarrassment and an indication of what Strummer would do in the future: nothing."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Just like Lennon needed McCartney and Jagger needed Richards, Strummer without Mick Jones is not the same. This is a Strummer project, not the Clash, and it hardly deserves to be considered along with any other Clash album. Anybody who considers this to be a great album must be a johnny come lately, who never saw the Clash live or picked up the Clash's albums when they came out on vinyl the first time around. All of their albums were breakthrough albums that stretched the boundaries of music and solidified their role as the only band that mattered. If you consider Green Day or the Offspring punk, go ahead and buy this album, but for those who were there the first time around and know better, don't waste your time or money."
2,if you cut the crap from this you'd have a decent ep,this is like a Clash karaoke lp with faux punk singalongs. there's actually some potentially decent songs but you'd never know considering how crappy they sound. Joe Strummer personally disowned this album
2,"""Collectable"" (read: sparingly purchased) sixth Clash album,","You wouldn't get into many fights going around saying Cut The Crap wasn't the best Clash album. Released in their final year of trading (1985), imagine a Beatles album recorded in 1971 without Paul or Ringo. The mighty Topper Headon had left under a drugs cloud in '82, and co-songwriter Mick Jones was thrown out in '83, but Joe Strummer and Paul Simonon (casting themselves as the ""wise men"") soldiered on with three ""street kids"" (according to the sleeve), and recorded this 40-minute suicide note, under whose wonky beatbox, Pistols riffs and terrace anthems Strummer's unique personality is buried. It contains a song called ""We Are The Clash"", but they weren't - The Clash were the greatest rock'n'roll band in the world."
2,Every Band has a Swan Song,"...and this is The Clash's. Had it been released as a Joe Strummer solo record, it might not have inspired the vitriol that it did on original release. But that Strummer and manager Bernie Rhoades had the nads to include ""We Are The Clash"" as a song pretty much guaranteed that ""Cut The Crap"" was soon going to be known as ""Pull The Plug."" There was exactly one great song here in ""This Is England."" I have since dropped ""Cut The Crap"" from my library since that song's appearance on ""The Essential Clash.""Other than that, if you must have all that The Clash and their spin-offs have recorded, ""Dictator"" and ""Movers and Shakers"" have some appeal. Tis a skippable CD, afterwards."
1,"""0"" stars","No matter how you slice it, this is the worst Clash album ever released. Major dissappointment on this. I have nothing more to say, except that ""Crap"" is crap."
2,this album is not indicative of the clash,"'Cut the Crap' is a seeming spin-off from ""Over-powered by Funk"" on Combat Rock. In it we see a lot more 80s pop influence (synth) and a lot less punk. The songs are boring and the clash seems bored playing them. I liked Combat Rock, and I liked it's experimentation. But this, this is complete unindicative of the Clash, in that it mires their political message with commercial trappings. It is by far the worst clash album. (And it pains me to say that.)"
3,its is the Clash after all !!!!,"not their best cd,but deffinatley worth getting if you are a Clash fan. bit different from earier clash,and a bit back to basics for them.but there are some gooe songs on it,If you are a huge fan of the clash,buy this album,if you are a fan o Combat Rock and its few hits on it and thats it,then pass it up"
4,REALLY GOOD,"The songs on this album rock. Bernie Rhodes ruined the album, not the band. The Clash will always rock!"
2,A mediocre attempt by a western writer at writing a mystery,"This book was not what I expected at all. I expected to read the history of Borden Chantry, father of Tom Chantry, and how he died, as Tom Chantry always talked about in L'Amour's book, North to the Rails. This was an attempt by a western writer at writing a mystery, which he obviously had little clue how to do. I was disappointed in it. It came across as a book someone would write just to make his quota of three books a year. I grew up reading L'Amour, and I wasn't pleased with this book. There is a new author critics call The New Louis L'Amour. He also puts mystery in a lot of his books, but this guy is really good at it. If you really like L'Amour, I would suggest you pick up a copy of Jonas's Death of an Eagle and compare. You'll see why I'm so down on Borden Chantry."
2,take that chance,I have met Brian Hilderbrand. He has a wonderful voice and alot of energy. He should continue with his music. I am sure once his fans find out he is playing again. His career could take a new path. An excellent voice.
2,Eh... BESIDES the fact that it's a boxed set.,"So I'm writing this not based on the fact that it's a boxed set of these three movies, but based on the fact that any one of them is not so impressive. I don't like Baz's direction because, in very short, it doesn't allow for the viewer to have an attention span - it felt like a continual climax and it tired me. (This is for all three of them, by the way.) Any one of them entertained me for about 40% of the time. That's 2 out of every 5 minutes for each movie. Therefore, it deserves 2 out of 5 stars."
5,Love Him or Hate Him,"Either you love Baz Luhrmann or you hate him. I love him--the color, the dancing, the whole singing, blooming, fuzzy overdoneness of his musicals, and, yes, I'm a sucker for love, too. It's not because I'm a woman. My husband loves Luhrmann and loves it that people fall in love, albeit tragically in Romeo and Julet and Moulin Rouge. This is a great collection. Strictly Ballroom is a premier feel-good movie, but it's also a brilliant take on the Hollywood musicals of the 50's. Romeo & Juliet is a bold reconstruction of how Shakespeare wrote his plays: full of hyperbole, often to the point of bombast. Shakespeare used the popular songs of his day and also had a lot of violence in his plays. He wasn't writing for college professors, but to the ordinary people of his time. Shakespeare wasn't highbrow in the 16th century, and Luhrmann doesn't make his R&J highbrow. Moulin Rouge is over the top, but, as I said, either you like it or you don't"
4,Worthwhile Purchase,"This is definitely a worthwhile buy if you're willing to incorporate material that isn't canon published by the D&D publisher. There are many creative ideas here, including those for tattoo and ritual magic. One downside is that it has a heavy leaning to the Scarred Lands setting. This is no obstacle if you are willing to rename or rework some spells/artifacts. This book is especially nice for druids, paladins, bards, and to a lesser extent rangers. They seem to get many of their own spells instead of overlapping wizard/cleric spells which the Player's Handbook seems to do. It also has about 8 new prestige classes.The reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars is because the layout isn't as eyecatching as official D&D material, and the art is of dubious quality, not to mention lacking colors. This should not be a strong deterrant to purchasing this useful book, but should be noted. Overall, a very useful buy."
1,not arrived at expected time,"there was so much delay in arrival of this item so I returned it back , ..... .... ... .."
4,Gloves,A must have for a masquerade birthday party we attended in costume. we were decked out from head to toe.
3,"The ""Best"" of STEPS???","I have been a fan of STEPS since I saw them perform on Disney. They were amazing!! At any rate, I jumped at the oppurtunity to buy their albums, but I must say that I was a bit disappointed that they didn't release Gold here. The Best of STEPS is a relatively good album, its just missing quite a few good tracks. But I guess as Americans we get deprived! :-) Most of the songs are from the US release of StepOne. They have like one from the UK version and a couple from Buzz. Personally, I think it's a decent album, but it could've been better with more tracks!!!!"
5,The Best of the Best - STEPS,"While it is true that the Gold album has several more of the awesome Steps hits - this is a unique album, made for the great USA! It includes not 2 but rather 3 new tracks, including Better Best Forgotten ( not previously released in America) and the incredible Chain Reaction. The CD is just one memorable hit after the other. I am a particular fan of One or Sorrow, especially the US edition (on the album), and deeper Shade of Blue. Steps are the ultimate pop group and they claim to be nothing more. This group is so much fun and the msuic is great to dance to that I fully recommend it! Buy the Best of Steps!"
2,Read before buying Best of Steps!!!,"Here's the ""supposed best of album"" of the recently departed band Steps arriving as a last effort of the music label to milka few quick bucks. Don't get me wrong, I loved Steps for theirenergetic pop tunes, dance routines and charismatic attitudes, but what you get in this cd are 8 songs from the 1st US CD, 2 from the 2nd one, leaving only 3 ""new"" songs imported. In my opinion, more songs from the second album Buzz should have been included, balancing the CD for old and new fans. The other letdown is that the import version of this CD has more songs (17 or 18), better selection of songs that were never selected or given a try to be released in the US. If you really like Steps, get the first US released albums (Steps One and Buzz) and shell out a few extra bucks for the imported version of this CD (called Gold)."
4,Splendid,"Sarah's first solo effort is an ideal following of Black Box Recorder production, but with a personal romantic hint that sometimes misses in previous works. Really good one."
3,okay but not amazing,I received the package in a timely manner but I am disappointed with the book. Although the condition is good I payed for like new and it has some damage to the front cover. Also the cover shown online is not the cover that I received also disappointed about that. Overall okay but not what I expected.
3,"not as helpful as ""Say Goodnight to Insomnia""","This book is written in a very dry and unencouraging tone. There is a lot of useful information, but the cumulative effect was to make the problem of insomnia seem insurmountable. ""Say goodnight to Insomnia"", on the other hand, was exceptionally helpful - much more attention to the underlying thought processes and how to break them down, and practical steps to take in a very constructive manner. Get that one first, for sure."
5,Incredible book that I'd recommend to anyone w/ insomnia,"I've had insomnia for several years. I was on medicine for two years and my sleep got really light, where I'd wake up constantly throughout the night. Furthermore, it was very difficult to fall asleep. This book had the biggest impact on my life, more so than any other ""self-help"" book I've read. I cut out my meds and tried a program suggested in the book, where you fall asleep at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning, no matter how little sleep you've had the night or nights before. Some nights it was very rough. After 3.5 weeks, I started sleeping great. I've had the greatest sleep I've had in years. And all without medication. I do have an occasional night without sleep, but I make sure I don't try to fall asleep early the next night. I'm sure everyone is different, and this book points that out, and suggests different ideas for different problems."
3,"Good, but not as good as ""WWF ATTITUDE""","This game is well made, but the graphics are very standard compared to ""WCW THUNDER"" and ""WWF ATTITUDE"". Worth a look for the hardcore Wrestling fan anyway."
5,WCW vs. The world Rocks.,WCW vs. The World rocks. Sure you can't go backstage but you can go outside the ring. One thing I really liked about WCW vs. The World is that Reversals are easy to do. I once the CPU reversted and than I reversed his move and than he reversated my move again. I'd buy it right away.
4,One of the better ones out there,"You wouldnt expect it, but this game is good for all the wrong reasons. If you were to buy this, you wouldnt think the best wrestlers would be the the guys you never heard of right? By far the best finishing move in the game is called ""The Alcapulco"" by some guy whos name I cant remember. Its the most devastating move ive ever seen in wrestling, if he does this in real life to other people, I would suspect these people often become paralyzed.I will attempt to describe the move, it starts off as a regular suplex, but once he has the guy verticle in the air, he releases him and comes down into a piledriver. So basicaly your being dropped directly on your head from 6+ ft in the air. A regular piledriver is like 2 ft and you have almost no momentum. Same with a tombstone piledriver. This tops both by alot.Besides this one move, the game is average overall, not great, not bad. But this one thing made it better than average for me, worth a look in my opinion."
3,Ruined By Over-tones of Racism & Bigotry,"I was really enjoying this collection before I came to the story ""The Street"". I had to stop and re-read the story several times because I didn't want to believe what I was reading. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong, but this seems to be a horror story about what happens when a ""swarthy"" (psuedo Jewish) element takes over a neighborhood, sneakily encouraging ""besotted beasts"" (psuedo African-Americans) to go on burning, slaying, and destroying the land of ""our fathers"" (psuedo caucasians)...I used to love H.P. I understand the fact that just because he writes about monsters doesn't necessarily mean he believes in monsters. But, I can't help getting the impression that he was definitely a racist. He seems to be irresponsibly exploiting some very prejudiced fears. Somebody tell me I'm getting this story wrong. Otherwise, I won't ever be able to read another H.P. story."
1,"Right stuff, wrong publisher","I haven't had this specific volume in hand, but I happen to own a set of pocket size paperbacks of Lovecraft's works also published by Del Rey (and still available). These were poorly edited, and ill printed on crummy paper. A publisher who gives this kind of treatment to a writer doesn't deserve your money.If you like HPL, or just want to discover his works, do yourself and the publishing industry a favor, get your book somewhere else, there are some better collections and omnibuses around"
3,Beautiful prose. Weak plots.,"Yes, Lovecraft was a racist. Talent is not reserved for those whose ethics are palatable to our society. And Lovecraft did have talent.These stories are filled with wondrous descriptions, the likes of which inspired many current authors, filmakers and visual artists. Personally though, I find his plots to be rather weak. His common theme ""man is lucky not to know the truth"" is at best annoying and at worst overly predictable. Don't get me wrong. His work is worth a look. I just prefer his fantasy and dream cycle to these stories. The idea of the restriction of knowledge is repellant to me."
4,Samsonite means Quality,"I needed this plug adapter for a trip to France and it worked very reliably. It is built sturdily (not cheap or loose) and is nice and compact.This can only adapt to double-pronged plugs, and it adapts very tightly (the female end), it took a little force to put on and take off of any appliance plug. Also, this does NOT convert voltage, it only adapts to different outlet shapes. The male end is built to expand in order to fit snugly in european outlets and won't fall out. Overall compact and well-adapted design, very good value."
5,Works fine,This works fine in India. Don't use this for high voltage stuff but it works fine for all small appliances like electric shavers and cellphones etc. Good build quality too.
2,no grounding plug,"this product does not work for the three pronged plugs, which is how most modern plugs are. so you can maybe plug it in, but have to be very careful not to touch the third prong, or you can electrocute yourself. i sent them back, need to get something less flimsy."
3,Incomplete reprint blacksmith,"This was one of the first blacksmithing books I purchased, I was very disappointed. If you're interested in learning to make wood working tools and lathe chisels, then by all means, this is the book for you. I found the original version of this book at the library the other day, only thing he's done in the newer version is move things around a bit, added a section or two, (about more wood working equipment) and that's it. I was very disappointed in this purchase and have yet to go back to it as a reference tool for my shop."
3,Not bad,"This was the first smithing book I purchased. I found a lot of useful information in there, and I still find I refer to it at times. Though many of the procedures described in it do not go into a lot of depth, and in some cases color photographs may improve the text, this book inspired me to learn more about the trade."
4,Good Information but Somewhat Dated,"I think Alex Weygers is an amazing man, artist and engineer. This book has a LOT of good information on basic smithing but has a few small technical errors. The only drawback is that some of the items upon which he goes into great detail are things that most people would prefer to just buy, rather than make. However, the TECHNIQUES used to make some of these items (like a waste water pump) can be applied to other things. He is a world-class scrounger and tries to identify good sources of junk metal. However, the world has changed since he wrote this book and the composition of some of the junk auto parts he recommends has changed considerably. It is a book worth owning if you are interested in smithing."
5,Culinary artistry from Dallas,"For those who have dined at the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas, or for anyone who is deeply involved in the craft of gourmet cooking, this book is culinary heaven. The photographs of some of the dishes in the book are indeed fine art, and they entice the reader to make permanent residence in the kitchen studio, with spatula-paintbrush in hand, and mimic or alter at will the recipes in the book. Having cooked all the main dishes in the book, with varying degress of success, I can vouch for the idea that one must depart frequently from strict adherence to the recipes. Definitely try the creme brulee, but use a cooking torch instead of broiling. Can't find quail? Use Cornish hens instead of course."
5,Relax and Ride the Wave...,"Listen to this album when you're enjoying another picnic on another idyllic day with your soul mate. It'll fit right in, without being obtrusive, with the light breeze, clouds lazily strolling across the sky, and light conversation. Perfectly.Or if you're wishing you were on that picnic but, for whatever reason, it'll never happen again, listen to this album and you'll understand it's okay to take time to heal and ready yourself to meet that one special person who's also been looking for you. Endure. Sustain. Smile. Trust your gut. Heal. You'll love (and be loved) again. And finally, you'll realize loving yourself and all your imperfections is the healthiest love of all."
1,a poorly edited documentary; story misses the mark,"I agree with the two other negative reviews here and am surprised there aren't more dissenting opinions. This movie made me feel embarrassed for the people in it. The topic would seem to have a lot of potential but the folks who are featured are repulsive and there is not enough in-depth exploration of the art to make it interesting. The story rambled, and the Americans (yes, that includes Paul Pena) behaved so awkwardly it was painful to watch. There was just a low-level vulgar tone throughout the whole movie. In many scenes, Paul totes a beer and looks like an indigent. He comes across as pathetic, socially tone deaf, and totally unworthy of his own talent. Mario was a boor - always coming up with something obnoxious, loud, and totally irrelevant to say. (Why the hell he was invited on the trip is a mystery.) The filmakers did a poor job of setting up the story and getting me to care about it or anyone in it. Don't bother with this one."
3,2 Vesions : Totally Confusing,"I vividly recall seeing this movie in theatres. It was a double-feature playing with Buena Vista Social Club and I enjoyed Genghis Blues much more. Recently, I ordered the DVD and just watched it last night. It is not the same movie. The DVD version is terrible. I agree with the negative reviewers. On the other hand, the original theatrical release is brilliant. I am quite shocked by the gap between the theatrical and DVD versions. They are vastly different movies."
4,Fascinating stuff,"The overwhelming impression I get from this film is: wow, these guys are alive! They are not just making their way through a boring life, they're out there doing interesting things, doing cool stuff, having adventures & generally living their lives to the fullest. The ""they"" that I refer to includes just about everybody in the movie, from Paul Pena to the guys travelling with him to Richard Feynman to the Tuvans that Paul meets and befriends.The documentary gets hazy in spots (I'm still not sure of some of the Tuvan inter-relationships) but does a good job of establishing empathy with Pena, a blind man relying on others in a place far from home. The DVD extras are o.k., the interview with the filmmakers gave some backstory to the movie. I did not watch the film with the filmmakers commentary turned on; a commentary seems kind of contrary to the purpose of a documentary but I suppose you could get more factual info & technical details on the commentary."
5,Buy this book!,"If you're a parent or planning on becoming one, you need this book. The chapter on positive discipline is worth the price alone. Then there's the chapter on alternative treatments for common childhood ailments--a godsend during cold and flu season--healthy eating for the whole family, wholesome family entertainment (full of projects to do with your kids)... I have yet to find a parenting book so comprehensive and so reassuring."
3,"some good, some bad","There is a lot of good information in this book, but beware, if you embrace Judeo-Christian values, it may not be for you. Also I found it very strange that a book with the title Natural Family Living doesn't mention one word about Natural Family Planning (using no artificial contraceptives). What's up with that?!"
2,"weird story, probably not for kids","We were house-sitting, and our kid tore up a copy of this book. We read it before we went online to replace it, and I have to tell you, this is the weirdest story I've come across. It was so weird, we actually bought extra copies to give to adult friends with warped senses of humor. Wouldn't recommend it for kids, though."
2,"Glorifies violent ""solutions""","If you want your kid to think the solution to violence is more violence, this is a great book; if you want your kid to be a thoughtful, responsible member of society, it probably isn't. I read this book often as a child in the early 70s -- it was a gift from some relative -- and always thought the drawings were funny, but didn't really remember the plot. I then pulled it out of a box in storage last year to read to my kids and I was appalled. The story teaches that the only solution to bullying is to beat up the bully. Some people might favor that approach even today, but I think it's indicative of a philosophy much more at home in the era in which the book was written (i.e., 1961) than today."
2,Too Many MD's,"This book is poorly written. Too many Doctors and not one of them can write a complete sentence without over explaining. And then the next sentence attempts to describe the previous sentence. Mostly, so far, it's just self serving tripe. I am getting my doctorate in Naturopathy and this is required reading. If I didn't have to read it, I certainly wouldn't."
3,Naval battles and the personalties involved,"An excelleny description of the Battle of Jutland, why it happended, and the consequences for naval warfare. A surprising aspect of this book, are the lifestyle situations, of the personalities involved, on both sides. Very unusual for a book of this type, and pleasantly off-sets the technicals details, necessary to describe the conflict."
1,Not a true step workout!,"Once upon a time, maybe in the 80s when it looks like this thing was made, this might have been a good workout. Now, it's just plain boreing and stupid. And to charge almost $20 for it? A total rip off. Step routines are supposed to be fun, challenging, filled with variety and move you all over the step. This thing has one, and I mean one pattern and she just repeats if four times. Then she basically has you doing squats over and over and over...this is where the ""buns"" workout comes in. Why not just call the thing, the squat workout.It's a stupid video and I wasted my money. Don't waste yours."
1,Before purchasing from this author,"Before purchasing from this author, you might want to search for his name and badge number (#2197) on youtube, to see just what sort of person you might be encouraging and assisting in profiting from being a miserable failure at his ""duty to protect and serve"".I strongly recommend against buying this book."
1,Videos of this officer on youtube speak wonders about his true self,"I strongly recommend against buying this book. I saw a video on youtube of this officer instructing fellow officers to strike peaceful people if they do not ""do what you tell them""."
1,BDSM,This officer instructs his subordinates to beat non-violent protesters. Don't waste your time buying this book and giving this sorry excuse for a police officer money.
2,This is terrible and not worth buying.,"This is basically a nonsense book that isn't worth the paper it's written on. You might as well use it as burning material for your fireplace.Sergeant Peter Thoshinsky just takes terrible photos in this ""booklet"" if you can call it that. There are simply better books by real policemen and real photographers who simply do a better job."
1,Terrible,"This was a horrible piece. I wish that I could return it. Just terrible. Also, see this video of the author instructing his subordinate policemen to strike non-violent protesters[...]"
2,very elementary,"Frankly, I find this text rather elementary. It is written on about an 8th grade level and this ruins the otherwise good examples and thorough analysis. For anyone remotely interesting in actually learning economics (rather than just memorizing the book to get A's on tests), a supplementary source is needed."
4,Away All Boats,"I'm also a Navy Vietnam-era veteran and I do love this film. I had recorded it years ago and now can't find the tape so I am sure I will be getting the DVD here. This movie was filmed, in part, aboard the Amphibious Transport ship USS SANDOVAL APA (LPA) 194. I was stationed on this ship in 1968-69 until we decommissioned her. Watching the landing exercises in this film brought back many memories as I was part of 2nd Division which was the boat division and we were ""graded"" on our readiness.This has good acting and alot of adventure. The script was a bit hoaky at times but that can be overlooked. I highly recommend this film. Get it and Set Condition One-Alpha!"
5,He died far too early,"Jeff Chandler. Many of you have never heard of the premeture grey haired actor who died from a botched routine surgery. Well THIS WAS AN ACTOR. It is very difficult to acquire his movies. I chased Away All Boats for years. You won't see a better WWII naval epic. George Nader, frank Faylen, Lex (Tarzan) Barker, and a young Richard Boone co star. Chandler is equally great in the true life WWII epic Merrills Mauraders and the western The Jayhawkers with Fess (Davy Crockett-Daniel Boone) Parker."
3,"# 1 reviewer has it right, good for a rainy day","I was a great fan of Jeff Chandler when I was young. I did not even see this movie until years after his death. He was underrated as an actor, and died way to young (at 42 of blood poisoning following surgery in 1961). Men will probably appreciate this as a ""war film"" more than women. Women will only appreciate it if they were fans of Chandler in their youth. Most people don't know about him. He is all but forgotten today, and was in the mid-fifties one of the highest paid actors of his day. Check out the tribute sites to Jeff Chandler on the web, and buy Esther Williams new bio ""Million Dollar Mermaid"" due out Sept. 14."
3,"A nice movie, well acted , but a little slow in places","As a child I remember watching this one with my Dad and enjoying it very much. I wish you could give half stars because that is what I would give this. The cast is first rate with special honors going to Jeff Chandler and his turn as the Captain. He really show what command must be like. We see the worry over his crew and how he has to ride them hard sometime to keep them ready to do their jobs and still shows the feeling of loneliness that goes with the job. My only problem with this film is that it tends to drag in some spots, but still I think most fans of war movies, the Navy, and older movies will enjoy this one."
5,A great Clint Eastwood film!!,Can you find him? Mr. Eastwood plays a bit part in this pretty good WWII movie. I gave it 5 stars because I think everyone should see it at least once.
4,BS&T's mellow album,"I always refer to this as their mellow LP becuase there is no breakout, absolutely driving uptempo tune (More and More from 2, Lucretia MacEvil from 3) although Go Down Gamblin' tries but, for me, does not succeed. Overall it is still great to listen to this CD when you are in a laid back mood. HOWEVER Sony has doon a terrific job remastering this recording and bringing together the original LP graphics. If my memory serves, there was a Quad release of this LP...how about a 5.1 SACD guys!!"
3,Great arrangements can't compensate for only-OK songs.,"I like BS&T a lot, but the songs on this recording have always struck me as being relatively mediocre in comparison to some of those on some other albums. There are some strong points in the songs (""Cowboys & Indians"" and ""Lisa Listen To Me"" strike me as the best), but most of the others sound weak. Even the hit ""Go Down Gamblin'"" isn't much more than a throw-away of a rocker - - and oddly, it seems to lose its momentum with a lackluster guitar solo from DCT. The -arrangements- however, are superb: interesting charts, and unexpected solos. Dave Bargeron not only has a tuba solo on ""Go Down Gamblin'"", but on another song he closes it while playing one note and singing another through his horn.Hunt out ""No Sweat,"" or ""3"" if you can: better songs and arrangements that are at least as good."
2,Too tight,"Very tight ring, looks pretty nice but if you wear it it doesnt come off and you can hardly bend your finger because it is so big! Not for me..."
3,Metal of ring quite insubstantial,"The ring is pretty enough, but the metal of the ring is very insubstantial it pushes in very easily."
4,Glorious,"For us long-starved progressive rock fans in the U.S., this is like throwing meat to a starving man. This CD is worth its price for one song alone: ""Miracle Man,"" an ungodly powerful, mega-testosterone, glorious epic that I've blasted until my ears blew out. In my mind, it is perhaps the greatest prog-rock song of all time. Though the rest of the CD includes some ho-hum work, two other songs leave me in awe of Ton Scherpenzeel's composing brilliance: ""Hold Me Forever,"" an achingly beautiful song of lost love that almost brings tears to my eyes, and ""Rings of Saturn"" a melodic mid-tempo song with a touch of sadness that beautifully ends the CD. If you're at all a progressive-rock fan, you will love this album.Now if only once I could see Kayak in concert here in California, this twenty-year Kayak fan would die happy..."
5,The best guide to Shakespeare's royalty,"One of the foremost experts on Shakespeare, Peter Saccio, has written a fantastic book on the history and intricacies of relationships between royal families in the works of Shakespeare. I reiterate the same positive things said by other reviewers...an essential book, by a brilliant man, for anyone serious about getting to know Shakespeare's kings much better."
3,Product review,"I wanted a leave in for my daughters so it would be easier to detangle. This product is not what I expected,it still left their hair a bit stiff and hard to detangle. My daughters have thick 3 type hair , but this didnt work and it did not give enough slip. Will not re-purchase. Has a nice scent though"
2,Works well but stinks,Does great to detangle as long as hair is sprayed with water before brushing however this product has an overwhelming fragrance and I prefer products without one.
5,tames the frizz,"I have thick wavy hair and this product is perfect. It smells light and fruity and the scent isn't overpowering at all. But it's a light product, I don't think it would do for kinky curly hair which would need a heavier product."
3,A Good Little Lighter,"I have had this lighter for about one month. It lights fairly consistently, which is what I was looking for.There is one negative for this product, however. It is a bit small. If your hand is large, it might be hard to maneuver."
4,"works well, priced well","This lighter does what I need, it lights cigars in the wind. I have had it for a couple of months and the only issue I had was the ignition button heated up during repeated use while sharing the lighter several times on one occasion. The lighting instructions are to hold the button before pressing all the way. I did find that it worked more reliably when this was done each time. The window to check fluid level was very useful. I did not pay nearly as much for this lighter as I would have for many of the other windproof lighters on the market. I would buy this lighter again."
3,"Okay lighter, funky cap","The design is nice. Works as expected and you can adjust the flame with your fingernail. Issue I have with this is that the spring on the cap could be a little tighter. When you turn the lighter upside down, as many of us do, the plastic cap wants to go in front of the flame. So I have to use my finger to hold the cap open. Last week the latch to open the cap broke, it's some cheap pot metal, junk! So, I've not cut off the cap and all is well, if not ghetto looking."
4,Hasn't burned itself up yet,"Most refillables burn their valves out faster than anything else it seems. This one has lasted longer so far with no real indication of damage. It seems it has some sort of heat sink around the valve. The only downsides are that the flame strength changes a lot depending on the amount of gas in the lighter, the adjustment range is fairly small, and it doesn't hold much gas."
2,No better than any other butane lighter,I killed 2 of these in 6 months....no better than any other refillable butane lighter.
5,Punisher MAX rules!,"This whole series was top drawer tough-guy, DEATH WISH style mayhem, albeit carefully orchastrated and shot through with the blackest of humor and irony. For thirty years of my reading experience, I never cared for The Punisher...until I kept reading rave reviews of this mature audiences series by Garth Ennis. Just one look was all it took. I then ordered all the paperbacks, loved them so much I then sold them and bough the oversized HC collections (2 paperback series her volume).Ennis has left the series for the foreseeable future, but has indicated that he will be back.if you want a dark, often twisted urban read, this series cannot be beat."
1,Great series horrible prices.,"Great book best punisher series ever. If your gonna read punisher read this series. Ennis has made a masterpiece. BUT DO NOT PAY THESE PRICES....Completely pulled out of their greedy you know whats, by these sellers. Search around they go way cheaper on other places."
3,good resource,"I found this a good guide to read in anticipation of a trip to Costa Rica. The problem with any detailed guide like this is of course that the information becomes dated quickly as businesses come and go and patterns of commerce and development change. Still, in the absence of a more up to date version, this really helps prepare and guide the visitor to Costa Rica well."
2,Nice Try,"This DVD just does not cut it. It was made in 1970 and its obvious that no chnages to either audio or video were made before putting in on DVD. This is an excellent example of a very poor digital remake... The acting is not great, and is very easily made fun of. The story is also very mediocre and seems to drag on too long. The movie airplane makes fun of these shortcomings."
5,profrom dover,AOK MOVIES sent excellent dvd of this classic air disaster movie.Well worth the price.Seller highly recommended thanx Robt
4,Arguably the worst film ever nominated for Best Picture.....,"yet it stands as one of the best guilty pleasures of all time. To call this film a cheesy, overbaked soap opera would be understating things by a factor of twenty. Still, the entire cast chews scenery (especially George ""Freudian Cigar"" Kennedy) wonderfully and the ""effects"" (picture in picture silliness) are of the bargain basement variety. Overall, a ridiculous film with zero suspense and unsympathetic leads, yet full of unintentional laughs and a script unparalled in its inconsequentiality."
3,Airport movie,"cant give a review though I gave it three stars, due to my mothers friends husband was in the movie as a control tower xtra. I guess he even said a few lines. I havent seen this in years, & though I did buy the trilogy of it, I havent watched them yet. Him being a traffic control operator at the airport was a reason he got the actiong job. I never knew the man. But it must have been succesful for them to do 2 sequels to this one being the first."
2,DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING,"I ORDERED THE VHS TAPE ""AIRPORT 70"".ON THE COVER AND ON THE TAPE ITSELF IT STATES, FORMAT:COLOR.THE TAPE I RECEIVED IS IN ""BLACK & WHITE"" FORMAT.THIS WILL JEPORDISE ANY ORDERS IN THE FUTURE. PLEASE RESOLVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE"
4,The Granddaddy of Disasters,"Inspired by Arthur Hailey's bestseller, ""Airport"" delivers a fair share of drama, thrills, and humor. Considering it's age, it is rather tame by today's standards. Standing out among the cast is Helen Hayes as the impish stowaway and Maureen Stapleton as the desparate woman trying to stop her psychotic husband. Both were nominated for supporting actress Oscars, with Hayes winning. Also great are Dean Martin as the womanizing pilot, Jacqueline Bisset as the beautiful stewardess, and George Kennedy as the tough-talking maintenance chief. With it's well drawn characters and multiple plotlines, this old-fashioned thriller is sure to entertain all ages."
3,the mother of all disaster films,"sure this film is corny, but compared to its sequals it's an art house movie. I have read that Burt Lancaster only did this for money and later on called it the biggest piece of crap ever made. But it is a good movie and it avoids the excess coniness of the following films,especially airport 77 and 79, not that the airport 75 was much better. I liked Dean Martin as the pilot,although people usually find the idea of him as a pilot funny, but hey he was an actor and his part was no Hamlet. He was his usual self and good enough."
3,"Classic disaster film, mixed quality DVD- 4 * movie, 3 * DVD","I'll admit it: Airport is a guilty pleasure of mine. It's a classic disaster film, spiritual father to all from the Poseidon Adventure to the present day. We learn the stories of the people aboard a bomb-laden Rome bound flight, and those on the ground fighting a blizzard and blocked runway to get them home. Characters are a little thin, a little soap-opera-y, but better than many modern films. Helen Hayes in particular, is terrific in her Oscar winning role. The DVD is of mixed quality, a nice presentation of an un-remastered copy of the film. Some dirt and scratches are evident, but color and sharpness are fairly good. Screen aspect shifts, usually cropped pan & scan, but occasionally letter-boxed to preserve some wider shots. Film length is misstated on the box, at 136 minutes, not the 91 listed. Recommended for all disaster fans."
3,Not the transfer I was expecting but it's allright.,"I saw Airport screened on a large 70 mm Cinerama theater. I realize now that the film did not survive the change to a smaller TV screen, and that the film itself is not so thrilling as it was back in the early 70's.More importantly, given that this was one of the last films shot in the Todd-AO format, the quality of the picture in its Blu-Ray edition leaves a lot to be desired. I am neither a reviewer or expert, but from where I stand I noticed the lack of sharpness and fine details, that are clearer to see in the transfer of negatives of the same format (e.g., South Pacific)."
4,Airport,"Nailbiter at 20,000 feet. An airplane takes off in a snowstorm, then a crazed passenger (Van Hefflin) sets off a bomb hoping to kill himself so his wife can collect the insurance. So Burt Lancaster and Dean Martin (a playboy type who learns one of the stewardesses is carrying his baby) limp back to the now-closed and snowbound airport hoping to land in one piece. They do, of course, but only after a Herculean effort by the ground crew to clear the runway. Lots of subplots involving characters (kind of like a GRAND HOTEL in the sky), and very slick - but very entertaining and watchable. Helen Hayes won a supporting actress Oscar. (A great take-off on this and even better in some ways is AIRPLANE.)"
4,"When will ""Grease"" ever see ""dime one?""","Although Dr. Nino Greasemanelli's sick and twisted brand of humor is best appreciated on the radio, this is still a good book. It's unfortunate that he got such a raw deal from the publisher. Not only did they consistently mispell his name (Greasemanelli is one word, not two), but they also fail to provide a Greaseman glossary promised on the jacket. Still, if you read the book you'll enjoy lots of jokes compiled from ""Grease's"" bit vault. As good as this book is, if you can you should try to hear him on the radio or listen to one of the tapes compiled by his devoted listeners. A book about the history of ""Grease"" and his fans would be a great idea to a sequel to this book."
4,Not a Bio!,"Come on, it's the Greaseman. Did you really expect this to be biographical? It's a biography of his on-air characters and schtick.As to the comment about ""recycled internet jokes"" from some child, I have news for you: Most of these bits were done LONG before the internet. The NET recycled THEM, not the other way around. I started listening to these in 1985. I'm pretty sure I didn't have internet.Besides, it's the delivery that's the killer, and if you haven't heard him live, he blows Stern away and has the market surveys to prove it, dating back to 1982 or so. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it's harder to relay the full effect without the stentorian vocal delivery.It's obscene, it's funny, and no one gets out without a drubbing and humiliation.Grease is an equal opportunity offender--he hates everyone."
2,Not worthy of his talent,I listened for years during the DC-101 years & followed along afterward when the show was syndicated. But this book is essentially taking his main characters & putting a routine on paper. It doesn't work. It lacks the sound effects & the voices that make it great on radio. This had to be a money grab & nothing more.
3,"Technically accomplished guitar playing, slick production","Besides being a fantastic guitarist, Les Paul is also an accomplished engineer and inventor. This album does not showcase Les Paul the guitarist so much as it does Les Paul the producer. Many recording and mixing tricks are featured here, including his interesting trick of playing several licks, playing them back at different speeds, and mixing them together in such a way that they're all in the same key. These recordings sound wild and futuristic today; it's hard for me to imagine how they must have sounded fifty years ago.Some songs here (notably ""Lover"" and ""How High the Moon"") are great, but at least as many are disappointing. Also, Les Paul's highly sped up guitar tracks can wear on the ears after a while - they're on nearly every track. In short, this album is essential listening for anyone interested in great guitar plaing and fancy production, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it holds up well to repeated listening."
4,Les Paul Legend and Legacy,"I expected masterful guitar work and innovative, ground-breaking technology coming from the man who invented a lot of it, but this disc is so much more. I've always had a soft spot for 30s, 40,s and 50s music and this recording is a master example of that time. Cuts like Bing Crosby singing, ""It's Been A Long, Long Time"" are priceless and remind us how much feeling and tone these folks had. Les's guitar work is so good, Bing allowed him a full chorus and stanza break on that song instead of the usual line or two for a lead guitar. Some Les Paul recordings are extremely rare and expensive, if you can find them. This is an overlooked gem."
4,the best,This game kicks ass! When i first bought it i didnt really like it but my friends and i played the co-op alot. The grafics are good and the weapons are kick. There are plenty of cars to pick from. the reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because of 2 reasons.1. Te cars are hard to stop i mean like when you go its almost inposible to stop in time. my friends and i got mad at that.2. In co-op you have to have the dificulty on medium to beat it. If you put it on easy it will stop after you beat minuan.(i am not sure if you have to have it on medium to beat the 1 player.) All in all i think a twisted metal fan would like this game but if you have never played a twisted metal you should rent it first in case you dont like it.( i doubt you wont like it).
3,Get Twisted Metal 3 Instead,I thought TM2 was alot of fun for the first couple mounths. Then I bought TM3. TM3 is so much better. I would recomend getting it instead.
1,the series ends tragically,"After the messy intro, we kick into a long version of the hardhouse diva anthem by DJ Disciple. After that, we get a series of instrumentals, some energetic progressive, hard tribal tracks, others not so interesting. Track 4 is somewhat trance with some vocal, 5 is more uninteresting instrumental, and Sounds So Good has a good , if not repetitive, hook. From there, it's a long boring journey into instrumental land. The best volume in this series was number 1. They should have enlisted David Knapp to do the entire series. Track times:1. intro/Caught Up (10:49)2. Freekwency (6:45)3. Direct connect (6:16)4. Song to the siren (6:45)5. sunrise (4:39)6. sounds so good (8:49)7. Addictions (5:24)8. wake up (5:07)9. Transmission (7:32)10. Traveller's theme (3:52)11. the heartbreak/outro (8:23)"
4,Too cute!,"My 7 month old shih-tzu, Brewster, looks absolutely adorable in this ""preppy polo shirt"". The minute I got his in the mail I put it on him. Too cute!!The only downside is that it is rather long.. So when he needs to go to the bathroom we have to remember to roll the shirt up or take it off of him. However my husband always forgets so the shirt gets peed on alot. :)We love the shirt though!!"
1,self serving iowa writer uses dead friend,"A lousy book by a typical and quite untalented iowa type or model or what have you will swill writer. Poor sad Lucy being used by in death, she deserved a grander tribute. Just buy Lucy's book and pass on this self serving untalented trash."
5,Objective Heartbreak,"What makes Ann Patchett's book so wonderful and moving (and it is those things and more), is the fact that she tells the story of her friendship with Lucy Grealy in a way that restores faith in what friendship is really about -- i.e., this is an unfliching gaze not only at love but in confusion and betrayal, as well. It is also a book that reminds us -- in a time when, as a country anyway, we may have forgotten -- how one's commitment to individuality and passion make the world a bearable place to live."
2,So many allowances made,"The thread in this book about the hard job of becoming and being a writer was interesting to me. The endless demands of Lucy were not. I have enjoyed Ann Patchett's novels, but this book just made me irritated at how invasive she let the relationship with Lucy become. I admired the circle of people who tried to support Lucy and stood by her, I just didn't understand how they could keep doing it. I don't mean to criticize, it's just that I had trouble seeing Lucy as a sympathetic character. I realize she suffered terribly due to her medical conditions but there has to be a limit to anyone's behavior. Lucy was actually only hurting herself but so many other people were constantly drawn into propping her up. I just didn't find it uplifting or inspiring or all that interesting to read about their struggle."
4,Beautiful memoir of friendship,"Ann Patchett's story of her friend, Lucy Grealy's life and struggle with becoming a writer gives poignant insight to what the life of a writer is like. This novel is also a stark contrast to Grealy's own autobiography, Autobiography of a Face. While Grealy paints herself as spunky and independent, Patchett shows the other side of her friend, the dependence not only on people but also on substances to fill the void in her life. This is a tragic tale of a beautiful soul that never seems to find peace."
3,Portrait of an unhealthy relationship..,"This was a quick, engrossing, well-written but ultimately dissatisfying read.Essentially, the dynamics of the relationship between Ann and Lucy make unbearable reading. Not only is Lucy self-absorbed and entirely dislikable, Ann is, in her own words, an 'ant' who continously and monotonously allows herself to be trampled on. Whether the portrayal of Lucy was skewed, it certainly was subtlely damning.As much as I wanted to sympathise with Lucy (and as much as I did in the beginning), she is was overbearing and unbearable character, and her self-destruction was predictable and repetitive.While I continue to like Patchett's writing, this book seemed self-indulgent and repetitive. Lucy and Ann's friendship was annoying and unbalanced, much like the text itself."
3,Exhausting read,"I finished ""Truth and Beauty"" last night, and found myself glad that I had finished it. By the end, I was quite weary of Lucy Grealy's antics and neediness...did Patchett intend for Grealy to come off this way? The relationship between Patchett and Grealy seems one-sided as portrayed by the author, and left me wondering WHY Patchett felt such love for Grealy. Frankly, the book drained me."
2,Memoir Of A Disturbed Woman and Her Girlfriend,"The question is which is which? Read it and decide. Lucy and Ann share an intimate friendship, so intimate that I wondered throughout the book whether it had a lesbian content, active or subliminal. Lucy never married and was unusually fond of Ann; a fondness, which, from Ann's descriptions, often had a physical (though not necessarily sexual) expression. True, Lucy has promiscuous sex with men. But what is the reader to make of her affection for Ann--an affection that expressed itself in naked baths, ""spooning"" in bed, kissing? . . . Again, it's up to the reader to figure out what's what in this perverse friendship.As many other readers have noted, I couldn't understand what Ann saw in Lucy."
2,Sexual Confusion,"Lucy and Ann are the best of friends. They even share a twin bed together. Ann gazes at Lucy during long, leisurely, naked baths. Ann does Lucy's bidding, whatever the personal or financial cost. I was shocked by Lucy's demands--and more shocked by Ann's willingness to comply, like a leashed dog.I kept expecting Ann to go down on Lucy, what with all the kissing, sleeping together, and long, hard stares. This book reminded me of the art house film 9 and half weeks, except for the fact that in this case the portagonists are both females."
2,Not as compelling as I was expecting,"This book was chosen by my book club for our latest meeting, and I was really looking forward to it. But by the time I was about half way through I was bored and truthfully wouldn't have finished it if it weren't for my club. It starts out strong but becomes tedious pretty quickly. I guess I just didn't feel that emotionally connected to either character. Patchett is a good writer but I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,fairly good,"wonderfully written. if you put a gun to my head and ask who was a better writer, patchett or her friend lucy grealy, the friend that makes completes this companionship, i'd say grealy. much more forceful, passionate and wild writer, hence grealy is not alive now, but patchett is. good book however. check out grealy's writings too."
3,Not Sure How I Feel About This Book...,"Ann Patchett has shared such intimate details about Lucy Grealy that are devastating, but Lucy is not here to refute them. I would have felt better had Ann given herself the same kind of treatment as she had Lucy. It was as if she was outing Lucy Grealy in all her imperfectness, but just skating the surface of her own. What I did like was reading this after I read Autobiography of a Face. It filled in some of the missing details. I was especially surprised when I read that Lucy had written her memoir at the very last minute. It is beautifully written and I would never have guessed that she wrote it so quickly. I do recommend reading this memoir if you have read Autobiography of a Face as it does serve somewhat as a continuation of Lucy's memoir."
5,Ann Patchett at her best!,"Skip her novel, Bel Canto (I know. I know. It won prizes.) and go straight to 'Truth & Beauty', a memoir of her friendship with the poet Lucy Grealy. I wish i could say more but I don't want to take away a minute of your pleasure from reading this. You'll read it in two days or less, I guarantee you."
3,An Evil Friendship,"This book is unexpectedly good, mainly because it recounts, in excrutiating detail, the strange and weird friendship between a celebrated author and a not-so-celebrated friend--Lucy. Lucy shoots heroin, trashes her friends, and has seemingly randon sexual encounters. According to the book, she is self-aborbed and hedonistic. She has a ""sweet"" boyfriend, but he is rejected--tossed aside like everyone else in Lucy's life, at least in this book. It's interesting to note that despite Ann's gushing appreciation for all things Lucy, she is not even mentioned IN PASSING in her famed book.I would recommend this book to anyone interesting in socio-pathic relationships."
3,Keep Notes,A good book but I recommend taking notes on characters while you're reading - i think they repeat but I couldn't 100% remember who each character was so reminder notes would've been helpful to me.
2,Insufferably Saintly,"Patchett is an unreliable narrator. One cannot trust a writer who presents herself as saintly. Nor does the writer earn trust with a one-dimensional portrait of a needy mascot, which is the ""Lucy Grealy"" of Patchett's creation. I submit that Ms. Patchett attempted this elegy too soon after Ms. Grealy's death. She has not brought enough truth to Truth and Beauty."
3,Intimacy and friendship: Where are the boundaries?,"This book reminds me of a 1950s lesbian pulp novel where the protaganists meet, fall in love, marry men, but remain lifelong intimate friends. This is a work of nonfiction, but I believe the analogy is still valid.Ann writes at length about Lucy's serial relationships with men. But you have to wonder whether Lucy's love of Ann was more than just a platonic friendship. Why? Well, from Ann's own descriptions, Lucy loved her in the extreme. So much so that she jumped in her arms, sat on her lap, slept in her bed, kissed her (ON the lips).All the while, I kept wondering: what does Ann get out of this relationship? She reminds me of an addict, constantly returning to the source of her love, her joy, her anguish, her pain, her compulsion."
3,A One-Sided Friendship,"I think Ann Patchett is a fine writer, and at first blush this seems to be a well-written book. But I wonder how such a fine writer could go on and on about her love and friendship for this Lucy person without letting me the reader know what on earth she - or anyone else - sees in her! Lucy comes across in this portrait as selfish, manipulative, undisciplined, and annoying - yet Ann claims to love her and certainly invests time, money and emotion into the relationship. Lucy, on the other hand, invests nothing. Oh, she keeps telling Ann she loves her, but she does nothing to hold up her end of the friendship. Allusions are made to Lucy's ""words."" Maybe that would appeal to another writer, but the reader of this book isn't shown any conversation that isn't about Lucy.Had Patchett included some hints as to how she got drawn into this relationship and why she stayed, I think it would have been a better book."
3,Clever and Entertaining,"This is a nice collection of stories, all well done in Chesterton's infectious style. There are little bits of social dogma stuffed into the margins, but the stories are primarily amusements.One odd note - this edition of the book contains some very strange artifacts - noticably occasions where the word ""die"" is substituted for the word ""the"". Almost as if it were translated from German and somebody missed a few articles. There were several other instances, which I've forgotten, but the number of errors in the text is surprising. The binding is also not vey sturdy - it's pretty clear that this Elibron Classics edition has been rapidly put together and not intended to last through more than one or two readings."
3,Great Stories,"I wish it had a searchable table of contents. Fabulous book with engaging stories in a poor format. But it was very inexpensive, so it might be worth it to you."
2,Awful Disappointment for Chesterton Fans,"These six stories are completely missable for fans of the ""Father Brown"" tales. The ""detective"" here is Basil Grant, and he's omniscient and uninteresting-- he has no detecting to do since he just seems to ""know"" what's going on long before his dopy pals Rupert and Charles Swinburne.I'm a big fan of the Holmes and Raffles and Thinking Machine stories, as well as all of the Father Browns. But these clunkers have no place in any canon of Victorian or post-Victorian detective/crime fiction.Give this a miss."
4,A clever droll piece,"These are six, separate, stand-alone little mysteries that together contain a larger book-length plot. The book is full of cunning though largely innocent deception, and each story backflips into a droll surprise ending. The characters -- the practioners of queer, and quaint, trades -- are likewise other than they seem. For all the philosphical and theological depth of Chesterton, these stories are light and deft and thoroughly entertaining. This is a small book expertly turned and burnished -- an exquisite Victorian miniature."
4,"Funny and quick romp, though not his best.","G.K. is witty, and even his weaker works will still make you laugh out loud. This book is no different, a parody of the classic Sherlock Holmes type deductive reasoning. They are really several sub-stories that all merge together for a fitting conclusion, involving the queerest trade of them all. A lot of G.K.'s familiar themes are here, such as emphasis on atmosphere as opposed to details, and how things seemingly ridiculous not only make sense, but are actually necessary. Probably not the best place to start with his works, but if you're a fan these short stories will not disappoint."
1,Awful Formatting,I wish I paid attention to reviewers notations that they were reviewing the paperback book version. The content sounded interesting. This was downloaded to my kindle and the formatting is AWFUL!! One line would start across screen but the next line would contain 3 words at the most then continue on the next line. This formatting continued through the whole book. No full sentences or paragraphs completed as a whole. I could not finish. The cost was free. Sometime you get what you pay for (or not). Freebies beware!
4,some dark love songs,"I have waited for 10 years for sniper and other love songs to be released on cd. The album is very dark, typified by ""Sniper"", and ""Woman Child"". The album features the Chapin anthem ""Circle"" and Harry's favorites song that he wrote ""A Better Place"" to be. Over all a very good album. aaron neubauer"
3,Stress Free Guide to Public Speaking & Presentations Review,"This video had very useful and valuable information. The presention of the information did not hold my attention. There was one person speaking the entire time. There were no visuals, music, etc. The video would have been enhanced with external aids. It was difficult to watch this one person talk the entire time.I also purchased The Standard Deviants-Learn Public Speaking at the same time. It was wonderful!!! It was light yet very helpful, had some comedy and a variety of presenters. Loved it!"
3,Dolly Duet Is Superb,"Dolly Parton fans will definately be interested in this album. It contains the song ""Leave That Cowboy Alone"" which Dolly & Ray Benson originally wrote for their TV-movie Wild Texas Wind. The track is a definate highlight of this album. Also standing out amongst the other tracks is Benson's cover of the Marty Robbins classic ""El Paso."" Fans of the traditional Asleep @ The Wheel sound will be plesaantly suprised."
5,A Blessing For Any Parent,Rockin The Day Away....What a great collection of songs to help calm the kids. We have a 3 year old daughter and 4 month old son who can definitely be less than calm at times. My wife and I have used this CD to calm our son during the day as well as for singing to our kiddos before bedtime. Tracks 6-10 are favorites for me. I love having the backing tracks as my son responds well to my voice and I can sing them to him at night to help him back to sleep. A definite blessing for any parent.
2,For diehard fans only,"Slapped together while the band was breaking up, DRASTIC MEASURES pretty much deserves the scorn it gets from Kansas fans and the utter lack of attention from everyone else. John Elefante has said that the album was pretty much an Elefante Brothers album with the Kansas name on it, as they were the only ones working on it full time, and for the most part it really doesn't fit in with the classic Kansas sound.Having said all that, there's no doubt that the album's hit single ""Fight Fire With Fire"" deserves its place on THE BEST OF KANSAS, although it seems oddly out of place here, and the band performs this song to this day in their live shows. I've given DRASTIC MEASURES a number of chances but still find almost all of it very forgettable with the exception of ""Andi,"" a terrific John Elefante pop song that suffers only from not sounding anything like Kansas (except for Rich Williams' power chords).Recommended only for Kansas fanatics and the musically curious."
2,DRY SPELL FOR KANSAS,"KANSAS' DRASTIC MEASURES is a prime example of style over substance. While technically proficient, the songs for the most part are curiously empty and easy to forget. MEASURES also doesn't really seem like Kansas. Branching out is not unusual or detrimental but losing your core identity can be risky.New frontman John Elefante obviously dominates MEASURES, both as lead vocalist and composer. Although Kansas vet Kerry Livgren shows up, none of his earlier influence is evident. FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE is the best song and a passionate reminder of how good Kansas could be. ANDI is a pleasant change of pace but ultimately nothing special. The remaining tracks seem like fillers on albums by Journey or Foreigner.DRASTIC MEASURES won't stand as a crowning moment for Kansas, but it shouldn't diminish their status as a great force in progressive rock history."
3,the kansas ZAP,"OK a bit of a shock to me and many other Kansas fans this cd wasOn first play I hated it , but I`m a ... for punishment and i played it a few more times and you know ? its not half bad. Mainstream and Going through the motions are great songs I can tolerate Fight fire with fire I like everybody is my friend and Andi is a good song. Plus there are bits and pieces on side two that also send the kansas ZAP. Kerry Livgren was going through writers block at the time and this CD sounds not much like the Kansas we know and love, but if you keep an open mind with this one you may find some great songs and enjoyment. Dont give up on it as its worthy of being called a Kansas cd. I will give this CD 3 stars because I actualy like it much more than most of the stuff that was released by other artist in the early 80`s"
1,Dissapointing Rubbish!!!,"From beginning to end this album is far and beyond a work of John Elefante. John has an amazing voice and even displays some great chops but his song writing which dominates this slab of garbage does not deliver any nuance of what Kansas once was prior to this release or what they were after for that matter. Vinyl Confessions was brilliant prior to this album, a true work of art and seemingly full band effort. This album contains ZERO violin..not even sure if Robby is listed in the credits. If he is, I am sure he was not happy about it. Even the song Fire With Fire in this age sounds over produced and very outdated. The only shining moment on the record is the moment before it starts and the moment just after it ends...oh yes...and the cover is actually amusing. Kansas did much better before AND after this project."
5,Last Great Kansas Album,"As a fan of the original Kansas, I love the lyrics and the music in this album. Not in the style of the original band, but the lyrics of several songs are among the best of the band; that's what makes this album special. I wish the members in this album plus Steinhart could do an album. Oh well, wishful thinking."
3,johnny winter still alive and well,"love the albut , but I ordered Lp instead of CD , my mistake just cost a little more and my turntable has quite a few years on it , so instead of going through the trouble of returns, I kept it now it don't have the cd I tryed to order, so I'm SOL, just need to pay attention when spending my hard earned money . thanx Bobby"
2,Johnny Winter Trys Rock...,"Johnny Winter was never really into Rock (being more of a bluesman)but at times he at least pretends to like it.This album is one of those times.Once again Johnny has to rely on Rick Derringer to prop him up,dust him off and get him thru this album.If it wasn't for the solid production skills of Rick Derringer this album might have flopped but Rick pulls it through not only providing Johnny with the title tune but also finding him a drummer(Richard Hughes).Another popular tune was Dan Hartman's Can't you feel it.It seems Johnny was never much of a songwriter.It's amazing this lp made it to #23 on the billboard charts at the time, even though it never had anything close to a hit single.One wonders though was it Johnny or the success of the then Edgar Winter Group which helped the album along?"
2,Still Alive & Well,"The album is too short, mainly due to the duration of each song. Only 12 titles. Need to review personal objectives prior to purchasing."
4,Scorching blues/rock from the great Texas Master.,"Johnny's comeback from heroin rehab album of 1973, it has some great tracks, including the Rick Derringer track Johnny took the title from. A treat for any lover of blues and rock."
4,THIS GUY KNEW HOW TO ROCK THE HOUSE,"I HAVE LOVED JOHNNY WINTER FOR AS LONG AS HE'S BEEN AROUND. HIS EARLIER STUFF IS MORE ROCK AND ROLL, AS COMPARED WITH HIS LATER WORKS. THIS IS A GREAT CD, ROCK ME BABY, LUCILLE, ALL TORE DOWN, ARE ALL GREAT SONGS. ONE CONCERT I REMEMBER IS JOHNNY WINTER OPENING UP FOR STEVIE RAY VAUGHN (THE DOCTOR PEPPER MUSIC FESTIVAL ON THE PIER BY 42ND ST. IN NYC BACK IN THE 80'S). DON'T GET ME WRONG, I LOVE STEVIE , BUT LISTANING TO JOHNNY TEAR THE HOUSE DOWN JUST SHOWS HOW MUCH MORE HE HAD TO GIVE."
5,If you only buy one of Johnny Winters CD this is the one to get,"A great collection of clean crisp Johnny Winters slide guitar work at the top of his game.If your looking to add Winters to your collection this in my opinion is the one to get. Every song in this collection is classic Winters, and in my honest opinion this is Johnny Winters at his best. Every song is a joy and some of the songs show off some of Johnny Winters best slide guitar work.There are ther J.W albums that deserve credit but this and Saints and Sinners are my two favorites just my opinion, but if I only had one to buy?"
4,Great Album!!!!,"Glad to see that Johnny is ""Still Alive and Well""!!!!Man, what a musician! I love this guy, and I love this album.Why 4 stars? I give very very few albums 5.... 5 is perfect. I haven't heard many perfect albums.Keep going, Johnny. We love ya."
3,The Fatal Shore.,"To date I have read 25% of the book. I'm struggling. I was expecting a novel type story following a few people through the whole dreadful experience.Getting to know them and suffering with them. To date I'm reading extracts of letters and extracts from other books. It's more like a text book I'm reading.It's interesting and chilling and eye opening but it's not a novel to my mind. It's not sucking me in. Don't let me put you off. Cheers, John Roughan."
5,Clear insight into the complex and unique Australian story,"At this time of focused international interest in Australia, it is incumbent upon any thoughtful reader to view this diverse and exciting continent through the lense of Hughes' profound history of the nation's founding. I have never been to Australia, but have known several individuals who came to America for education and career reasons. At first blush, it might seem to an American that Australia shares much common experience with our own: British colonial origins, settlement of a vast western frontier, the oppression of an indigenous people, strong Judeo-Christian traditions, etc. These factors are all present. However, understanding the differences between the Australian and American experiences must start with an appreciation of the role that the English ""transportation"" system played in shaping Australia. There is no better treatment of this subject than ""The Fatal Shore."" It is truly a great cultural history of Australia's beginning."
3,The Fatal Shore,"I found it rather tedious to wade through, some interesting iinformation & statistics but a lot well known. I thought it was more about the settlement not disjointed facts. Disappointing & boring."
5,Outstanding -- of Australia and the England we came from,Maybe not as polished as a Michener book but certainly on par with his best historically.
2,As Boring As The History We Hated In School!,"The first third was ok,but after that I skimmed through to the end,and relief at last!Not written in a way to make it interesting.It is extremely tedious to read.Reads exactly like a textbook.I am hoping I will be able to find a book about the founding of Australia that is actually an *engaging* read. The Fatal Shore missed that mark by a long shot!Very Disappointing."
3,Informative but difficult read,It took me over a year to finally get through this book!!!! I found the subject matter interesting and Australia rise from its very humble beginnings is impressive. Still the book certainly drags at points.
2,Fatal shore or fatal flaw? History as sham,"Try doing quantative analysis on Hughes' statistics for floggings conducted at Macquarie Harbour, the place of secondary punishment situated on Tasmania's west coast. The figures are internally inconsistent. This book is based largely on impressionistic accounts, many sourced from the 19th century convictism literary genre. The Fatal Shore is a popularist and popular account by a storyteller. It is sham history."
2,"Dry, overly technical","While there is all sorts of interesting information about the founding of Australia, it is overly dry and technical -- more of a textbook than I had hoped. There is no story to the book, just every possible detail about every possible facet of life in early Australia.This book would be much better suited as a reference, not a book to read from front to back."
1,Don't waste your time...,"I hate to disagree with most of the other reviews..well, no I don't...but out of the hundreds of history books I have read this has to be one of the worst. I found myself skimming whole chapters. It is poorly organized and boring. A masterpiece? Bravo? Books like this are the reason most people hate history."
4,The Fatal Shore,This is a gory retelling of Convict life in Australia. Robin Hughes says it is slavery where men were at the mercy of sadistic monsters. This might be a exaggeration but it does give a moving picture of the convicts life.
4,The Fatal Shore,Interesting in that it had the views of the convicts from their letters so provided a more balanced picture of early settlement than other documents I have read.
5,What's This Book Got To Do With America ?,"To the reviewer below.....this book is about the founding of Australia. It has nothing to with America. You should focus on reviewing the book rather than using this as a platform to express your political views. Anyway, this book shed much light on Australia's origins. This is history not too well-known. I didn't realize there was this much detailed fact in the convict beginnings of Australia. It's a fascinating read and colorful characters come to life on the page. A highly recommended book."
5,Very well researched.,This book is really informative from very beginning. Absolutely amazing detail. Author should be congratulated. recommended read for sure. Ozzie Ozzie Ozzie Oi Oi Oi !!!!
3,the Fatal Shore,"This is quite a tome and covers extensively the plight of the English convicts, who were sent toAustralia and faced unbelievable, inhumane conditions, especially on Norfolk Island. Many of them didn't survive under their cruel and sadistic English masters.It's rather long winded and repetitive, in parts and I found myself skipping chunks of it to get through to the more interesting parts. It is not easy reading and certainly no historical novel.It is a book of special interest to people who are either Australian or to those who are familiar with Australia and its heritage.Edith"
5,Fatal Shore by Robert Hughes,I wish we had been given this book in school...he makes history come alive without being boring..just brilliant I would recommend Fatal Shore to everybody especially Australians who's knowledge of our history isAbysmal..
3,Hughes vs. Hughes,"Much as I enjoyed this work, and as informative as it is bound to be to any American reader who grew up learning nothing of the history of Australia, I found Hughes' violent swings of attitude about the colonization of his native land to be a major drawback. He simply can't make up his mind as to whether settling Australia with convicts was a good idea, a bad one, or something in between. He sometimes goes from pole to pole in a single paragraph."
5,Better than fiction!,This book was a great read. Hughes did an excellent job of creating the picture of Australian history. One of the best books I have read. The stories stay with you. I read this book just before a trip to Melbourne and Sydney and the places were just as he described them. Now I know why there are so many red-headed men name Sean.
5,ALICE COOPER LIVE.,awesome hd dvd alice cooper is so awesome. the hd dvd makes the sound so much better than a normal dvd. a true awesome hd dvd.
1,Big Letdown after Brutally Live DVD,"Very disappointing DVD. Camera cuts from one aspect to another at a headspinning rate. Crowd looks like zombies, not really into it. Maybe they don't understand English over in Switzerland. Rent Brutally Live if you want to get the feel of an Alice Cooper concert on a DVD produced with high quality. Plus the London crowd is alive. After attending AC's concerts annually for the past 10 years, the Brutally live DVD is the best one to watch if you want to see what Alice is up to these days. Classicks + some Brutal Planet tracks. Live at Montreux doesn't even come close. Glad I rented it before making the mistake of purchasing."
2,"Good song selection, good band, weak singer...","First the good stuff:1. Lots of songs, spanning much of Coop's career.2. Good band, especially Eric Singer on the drums. That guy is phenomenal. The guitarists (Ryan Roxie & Damon Johnson) are somewhat average.3. Video quality is superb.4. Great show. Alice (even though he's probably 87 years old) has tons of energy.Now the bad stuff:1. Alice's performance is stunningly weak. Honestly, it's bad. He yells most of the songs, and the song Poison is just horrendous. (To be fair, he sounds pretty good on the ballads.)2. No extras at all on the DVD. Not one. Nada.I'm a big fan of Alice and have really been impressed with his last 2 studio albums (Eyes of A.C. and Dirty Diamonds), but this was a big letdown, mainly due to Alice's vocal performance."
4,very good,"Very good sound and video. Show is great, but I found I basically only like the hits - other parts just too hard rock for me."
4,Still Rockin',"Alice Cooper proves that he is alive and well in this amazing performance. In probably the best band lineup since the '70s, the show kicks off fast and the hits keep on coming. At first I heeded the words of other reviewers who bashed the camera and its seemingly ADD style of shooting, but I think it actually added to the show and helped create a sense of urgency and chaos. The only thing that kept me from giving this Blu-Ray disc a fifth star is the crowd. The first 10-15 rows are totally into it, and that's great. But after that, the crowd is formed of funny-hat-wearing jazz fans."
2,Alice Cooper 30 years later,"It's hard to believe that in 1972 I was still in High School and first saw Alice Cooper in Concert. I thought he was the GREATEST!!!Fast forward 36 years later as I watch this HD DVD concert from the comfort of my own home, sipping a diet Coke, having given up drinking (like Coop) years ago.It's true, you can never go home, and as I watched this dvd, I couldn't help but be reminded that Vince Furnier aka Alice Cooper never could sing a lick and still can't. Having said that, it's a fun trip down memory lane and his new band with Eric Singer on Drums is in fact better than the original band.Having said all this, what was cool many years ago is now a caricature. RIP Alice.PS. THE HD DVD had a LOT of bumps in it and I now know why Blue Ray won!"
1,WON'T WORK,"i GOT A COMBO DVD/CD AND BOTH WOULDN'T WOK. I SENT IT BACK AND YOU REPLACED IT. THE CD WORKS FINE AND THE DVD WON'T WORK,SAYS UNKNOWN DISC.IWROTE TO YOU AND NEVER GOT A REPLY. I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM AMAZON AGAIN.THE CD WORKED IN MY DVD PLAYER."
5,Better than the Chicken Soup books,I loved this book. I actually thought it was better than the Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul books. This book is quite uplifting. It is trully a great read!
4,Good for regular SD cards,I didn't realize when I bought this it doesn't work for SDHC cards. It worked fine for my other SD cards but I ended up having to order another one.
4,You will read with enjoyment,"Excellent details...reading this book is like being that ""fly"" on the wall. Mr. Rencher goes above and beyond to give his readers a very descriptive details of the 70 era and characters. The Joshua Tree is a wonderful drama with the bonus of romance. This novel does a wonderful job of expressing how powerful love is! You journey through the torment of Sarah and the love and effort of Joshua to save her. This book is a treat for the passionate readers.Margot Herrell""UnTchablGAAL""G.A.A.L. Book Club of Atlanta"
3,"Fast read, but superficial",The book was a very fast and easy read--took me about 90 minutes to read it. It is interesting but it did not tell me anything that I didn't know about ballet except for maybe the Balanchine quotes. It is a good book for teenagers and those who don't know much about professional ballet. I was expecting something a bit more profound but I guess I expected too much. She was quite young when she wrote it so it is a courageous attempt for someone so young and also decently written for a first publication.
4,Mustaine Not Mellow Live Either,"This double live album and apparent send off for one of thrash metal's giants shows why they should be(and usually are)respected as true metal stalwarts. Leader Dave Mustaine's fiery tongue and trademark riffing are on full display in too numerous places to mention. Newer songs like ""Dread..."" and ""Return To Hangar"" sound just as menacing and accusatory as older chesnuts like ""Mechanix"" and the band's long time credo ""Peace Sells."" Lead guitarist Al Pitrelli adds his own spark while reproducing the classic lines of ""Wake Up Dead"" and ""Ashes..."" The musicianship and mind of Mustaine is stellar and still full of life after 20 long years and this disc shows that. While his band may never have reached the pinnacle of popularity Metallica enjoyed, that in no way makes Megadeth any less important. And I'm sure Dave would be the first to tell you."
5,The greatest of and live!,"Fast, loud, thick and clear sounding live performance of Megadeth's greatest songs and who could complain?You have ""Peace sells!,"" ""Holy wars!"" ,""Angry again!"" , ""Hangar 18"" and ""Return to Hangar"" , and more.This live performance covers ""Killing is my biz"" to ""World needs a Hero!"" On two CD'sNo more neeeds to be said.Enjoy!"
5,excellent live album,"This album sounds great, nice chunky clear recording. My gripes with it are: some songs (ie. Hanger 18, holy wars) are played to fast for their own good, Al Pitrelli doesn't play some of the friedman solos very well (especially hanger 18). And I hate the songs trust and kill the king. But thats just me. Contarary to what some people have said in their reviews of this album, Dave Mustaine sings all the songs on this album (just watch the DVD), but he cleary is straining a bit on a few of them (Train of Consequences, Devil's Island). At first I found it a little bit cringy, but i soon found myself enjoying this singing. It never really sounds off key, just raw and weird. The singing at the start of Tout Le Monde is pretty poor though. Overall, very good album, everything played excellently, good choice of songs. Devils Island is just brilliant...."
4,MEGADETH GO OUT IN A SYMPHONY OF DESTRUCTION....,"....and decibels. This excellent double CD captures the energy and heaviness of Megadeth's live performance. With their disbanding metal has lost one of its greatest bands, but RUDE AWAKENING will be pumping out of your stereo speakers for years to come. The track list includes the expected classics like MECHANIX, HANGAR 18 and SYMPHONY OF DESTRUCTION; though the RISK album is completely ignored, which really isn't such a bad thing. Unfortunately the likes of RATTLEHEAD, GOOD MOURNING/BLACK FRIDAY and SET THE WORLD AFIRE aren't on the discs but why complain? I just hope that one day they'll be back."
2,Megadeth Rude Indeed...,"Megadeth never sounded good live on a disk and this is no exception. Although the last tour was great and in my opinion was a high point in Megadeth's live playing career - on the sterile unforgiving format of CD, where every bum-note and nuance can be heard they simply have never been able to cut it. Dave's voice is far too strained and inconsistent live to do any justice to the material on the albums they've recorded and the constant use of ""autotune"" (a digital pitch correcting process) makes Dave's voice very plastic like and quite frankly unenjoyable. Megadeth's strength is their studio efforts not their live recordings...stay away...."
2,"No matter how good or bad, it's just another compilation...","The first live Megadeth album.. so what? Megadeth entered with full force into the realms of compilations: first, the horrible Capitol Punishment,; now this live album, which does not contain their classic line-up (Mustaine, Ellefson, Friedman, Menza). So, what's the point to obtaining this album? I can't see it."
4,Solid Live Disc.,"If you are a Megadeth fan, this is a must have. All around it is a solid disc. The sound quality is very good and captures that classic Megadeth sound. The setlist is what is so great about this CD, covering a long span of music including all of those Mega-essentials. A definate must for fans of heavy guitar."
2,Haven't used it yet,This wasn't exactly what I'd expected. I have yet to start using this book as it's intended - to sketch your own landscaping out. I need more picture books for ideas and such first. Hope to use it once we design our xeriscaping - which may be next year.
5,meenty,"1. more beautiful than personal violence between lovers.2. if terrence mallik had directed million dollar baby, it might have sounded like this."
3,"A little death, a little art","3 1/2Brutally heavy band, with just enough artistic merit to warrant distinguishing from the legions of groups that scream their evil upon us in unconvincing manner. Converge still feel like a band beginning to explore new terrain, as the more wickedly unescapeable songs like the sonic prime evil exuded from the title track show. It is in the staggering simplicity that Converge feel the heaviest, churning black riffs on top of a proper death metal vocalist-one of the few that actually seems to justify the overdone approach to screaming with a snarling terror never falling into near-parody. The band seems promising, one of the few in the genre to watch for helping to transcend it's narrow confines."
5,HEAVIER...,"Yeah, I was excited. Yeah I got it when it came out, first day. There are some really cool parts to the songs, which is what I got out of it. Youll probably like to skip past the two long middle tracks, 'heartless' and 'you fail me', because they just drag. And it really does take a little away from the rest of the short album. Its like 30 something minutes in length. Almost every other track though is reason enough to get this album. Jake and Kurt really came up with some killer riffs. And vocals are different on tracks 2 and 12, a different type of scream for Jake. Its a weird concept album, but for the most part it works and really makes you want to go insane to the beats. Support Converge, a Boston journey band. Just listen to it open minded..."
5,Originaters,"The godfathers of the hardcore/metal scene are back with ""you fail me"" its defenely a change from jd but it still has the same brutallity and egde of converge. I lvoe every track here and the lirycs? Pure genious. Crazy,chaotic,insane and all the above. Get it !"
2,Not that good,"I read many opinions on this album and while we all know what opinions are like, I thought I would write my own.I found this album very disappointing. It sounds very rushed and converge really needs two guitarists. There is a gem or two on this record but they could have done much better. Nobody wants to hear high pitchy whiney guitar chords over and over again. That stopped being artistic when slipknot overdid it. Sorta like when ashton kutcher started wearing his hat crooked on punk'd, but that's another matter. ....anyhow Jane Doe was amazing. When forever comes crashing was amazing. I heard the song plagues from no heros and that sounds much better. More so than 90% of You fail me at least. I really did try to give you fail me a chance since I paid money for it, but it is pretty much crap compared to all of their other records."
2,the great downfall,"so, i was a bit skeptic on the new converge. i did not really enjoy jane doe much, and i heard from all the reviews that this was ten times better, and you could see some roots on converge returning. so i bought it. i cant say how disappointed i was. as far as i am concerned.. this is just a more *well put together* jane doe... and return of their roots? there is not ONE real sing along part.... nor i should say your typical converge guitar riff.... jacob has totally changed his vocal style, he has cut down on the vocal distortions.. which i felt was great about converge on *when forever comes crashing down* the cd is not BAD, but as far as converge goes- i do not listen to it telling myself this is converge, it is too differant form the converge i grew up with. sadly the best track is the title track. i was very disappointed in this cd. i would not recommend it to anyone. converge has changed everything about their music.tony"
2,title of review,"I still don't like this band. Their music is like thrash-punk-hardcore. The off-timing changes work well I guess, and I see a comparison to Botch from that, but I'm not into it. Their intensity is a gritty streetpunk type intensity, and I like my metalcore to have more of a crunchy metallic edge and be less rock n roll. I can see that they're a bit more sonically adventurous than your typical streetpunk hardcore band, but it's not enough. This music is weak and boring. I just don't get the melding of Black Flag and Motorhead influences with Botch and Dillinger Escape Plan influences. The former just dilutes the edge and intensity of the latter. Keep punk rock out of metalcore."
1,Outdated video,While the DVD says that it is in 2008 the information was obviously recorded in the early 80s. It has not been updated since then therefore it is more than 20 years out of date. I highly recommend that you do not buy this product. You will be disappointed in the information contained within. If you're interested in alternative energy I suggest you pick a different product.
3,Good Simple Lanyards Instructions,This book is a good starter kit for kids who like to make lanyards.
5,"The one, the only, Judy Garland.",Anyone who thinks Judy's voice was gone by the sixties should buy this album. The first time I heard the L.P. recording I was just blown away. Her powerful voice and her emotional rendering of the lyrics are unbelievable. The C.D. is even better than the original L.P. Highly recommended.
5,Brutality at its best.,"I just listened to the samples and was blown away by this band. ""I was throwing up through every sample"". That's how brutal they are. I can't wait to buy the album. If you like bands like Kreator, Destruction, Beneath the Remains Sepultura, Reign in Blood and Divine Intervention Slayer, Dark Angel, etc. Get this disc. Only for metalheads that like old school brutal speed - thrash metal. You should also try Necrodeath and Criminal. Anybody can recommend any more bands like Hypnosia, please? I would greatly appreciate it."
1,Quel dommage...One of Deneuve's worst!,"I must say that I agree with everything readernyc said about this film (facelift comments aside)! As a truly devout Deneuve fan, I was thoroughly disappointed with the slow, meaningless ""plot"" and (lack of)chemistry between the actors (and why William Hurt??!!). Yes, Ms. Deneuve is still beautiful, as always, but there are plenty of Deneuve films much more worthy of your dollar!"
4,Cheap and effective,"If you only have a cheap, flat plastic ice scraper like the type companies hand out as promotional items, this is definitely a huge step up. Clearing away ice with this takes a lot less time and effort, and the foam handle is round and easy to grip while wearing gloves. It probably doesn't clear away ice as easily as a scraper with a brass blade, but it performs well for something in this price range and has also made it through several winters (and ice from multiple blizzards) so far without fracturing like the freebie scrapers."
1,No better (maybe worse) than a free one,"I've only used it on frost so far, but it simply doesn't work. No matter how much pressure you apply, only the edges of the scraper come in contact with the glass. Maybe it works better for heavier ice, but for frost, the free one I got years ago works much better. Pretty disappointing."
3,got misled,"I thought it is 10 inch wide,no,it's 10 inch long! my bad.anyway it is a good normal scraper you can buy from anywhere local."
4,"It works, Kind of","If you hold this tool with the ice chipper side up (meaning, the way you'd assume to hold it, with the big flat side down) the flat side doesn't QUITE lay flat on your windshield. Meaning, you get two scrape points, and no scrape point in the middle, rather than one continuous scrape point. So, it doubles the work required. If you hold it the other way, with the Ice-chipper part facing towards you, and push, it works, but that's an awkward way to hold it.It does the job it's supposed to, but not in the most convenient way. I do like the grip on the handle as it keeps your hands from getting too cold by holding onto cold plastic or metal."
5,Amazing!,"I borrowed this book from a kind lady who was willing to lend it out. I am forever greatful for this! I have read many books in my life, but this book may be the very best I have ever read. I truely wish this author would write more books. I could not put it down. I was thoroughly impressed with her knowledge of the world and past ... there was very few mistakes that I caught, being a history minor. Very impressive and hard to put down ... a must read for anyone interested in fantasy and/or history ... it combines all into an imaginative experience. Not a book you want to miss out on!Now that I have borrowed the book, I am planning on purchasing. It is a must for my book collection. One that I want to re-read and SOON."
5,Excellent,"I received the material in a very timely manner, the quality was as described. I most definitely would buy from them again."
5,Delicious!,"I had long enjoyed these, but they had disappeared in NYC supermarkets. What a pleasure to have found them again."
4,Very different.,"This is the very first twisted metal game to come out and i loved it. It is different than the rest of them but it is still fun to play. It has the original people and tracks to go to so if u have played any of the other twisted metal games u will reconize most of these people. It is very hard to beat because it is the first game and it took a long time to get used to. The graphics well this is the first one, its on the ps1, and it is a very old game so yes they r not very good. It is all blocky and the cars move in weird directions. This is a great game on multiplayer though, there r many different things to do unstead of just battleing each other. After u beat the game a couple of times it is easy to play and beat ur friends at it. This is a very fun but challenging game."
3,Twisted Metal,"Twisted Metal 1- Not the best game that I've played, but its pretty cool. Great for first time Twisted Metal gamers. After you've defeated it a few times and can beat your friends at it, move up a notch to TM2, which I think is the best of the all. You might not, though.Bottom line is that if you are just starting to play the Twisted Metals, I would start with Twisted Metal 1."
3,Not the First,"Twisted Metal started the whole car battle racing genre for the game consoles, but it was not the first of it's kind. For that you have to look to the British video game Carmageddon. It was the first and IMHO still the best one out there!Both games now look a bit dated, but for sheer fun and mayhem, they can't be beat and Camageddon is the deeper game of the two."
2,Twisted Metal,"Twisted Metal is a great game. Nothin beats fully equiped vehicles battling it out all over the world in hopes of becoming the victor and claming the ultimate prize, anything they desire.....You battle your way all through los angeles desroying everything in your path. There are may vehicles to choose from such as darkside, sweet tooth, yellow jacket, outlaw, pit viper and many more. You should definetly pick this one up. Check out Twisted Metal 2, its even better than this one. Get'em both....."
2,Not very good,i got this game a couple of weeks ago and I do not see how anyone could like it. The computer always gets behind you so you have to turn around with horrible car physics which takes a while with people like Darkside and Minion. The cpntrols are bad and all the fighting seems to be in the same place. You can have some fun woth this game though.....
5,Cute!,"This apron came quickly and looked exactly like I was hoping. Nice size for anyone I would think. I'm about 5'5"" and this stops halfway between my knees and ankles so the length is good, even if you are a little taller. The neck strings measure like 26"" (perfect for HUGE heads) and each side tie string is 36"" perfect for the BBQing man with the 60"" waist. I guess the only thing I can think of to make this apron any better is if it had been made in AMEEEEERICA and not CHINA."
4,"Fun for kids, cheesy for adults","We bought this after we borrowed one of them from the library and our oldest son loved it. Unfortunately, our kids have watched it maybe 5 times now (not the whole DVD) and don't ask for it. I think it's a fun and educational way to teach kids about these things, so my husband and I are bummed that they're not excited about it. Yes, Dave is kinda cheesy, but the younger kids (toddlers, preschoolers) should enjoy it. I think they'd be more into it if we had started them at age 2. My 4 and 5-year old childcare girls always ask for it, though. I guess every kid is different. Still, I think the DVD is the perfect blend of humor, excitement, and information for kids, so I'm giving it 4 stars. The price is reasonable, so you could buy 1 set and see what your kids think of it. Their favorite is absolutely the Rescue one, no surprise there, and it's the most interesting for me, too. Our kids actually enjoy the ""There Goes a Bulldozer"" DVD, if that's any help."
3,Boys love it. You will hate it,My boys love all these videos. I do not love it. It actually is educational but really only appealing to kids >4
1,So bad... uncomfortable to watch.,"It's just bad bad bad. Children's entertainment is big money. There is so much better out there to choose from. These are at the bottom of the barrel in any sort of value. I simply wanted to sit with my son and watch trucks, street sweepers, trains, planes and tanks do their stuff with a lot of life-like noise. I don't want to see stupid horrible actors perform useless skits to fill 90% of the run time!!!!"
1,Horrible!,"I'm a big fan of Richie Ray's so I couldn't believe what I was hearing when I played this one. Sounds like Joe Cuba having a real bad day. If you like screechy amusical singing combined with Psychedelic Latin sounds maybe this is for you. Otherwise, save your money for Se Solta, Comejen, Jala Jala Boogaloo, etc."
3,OY VEY!!!!,"Richie Ray or Ricardo Ray, and his Salsero compadre, are great founding members of the modern Salsa movement and go way back to the Allegre-Tic0-Fanis-Jerry Masucci Latin days in Nuyorkian Latin Soul. This recording, and I use the word ""recording"" advisedly, has some value as a historic document. Pianist Ray-who is a world class piano artist-is unheard on this record. How about miking him? This was when Ray took Latin into Bugalu-Shin-a Ling,soul, but sound is awful. Please, go on to his later recordings. The pianist is a genius."
3,could've been amazing! wasn't.,"Unfortunately, this CD does no justice to this dynamic, very talented group. I saw them live and purchased the newest album and was completely disappointed. The bass isn't mixed in correctly, so that it's either overpowering or dull. Most of the songs sound muffled (perhaps the effect of the bass?) and because of this, seem hesitant and uninspiring.Perhaps this wasn't meant to be brilliance (tu me gustas, no me disgustas...come on.) but it's also not the funky great-to-dance-to production that these guys are capable of."
5,A Great How To of the Beverage World,This was my frist book about brewing. It was a wonderful read and an even greater kitchen companion. I love the simple recipies given in the first part of the book so that when you find a recipie with in the pages you are instructioned to death with the retellign of the basic steps. I would recomend this for any one who enjoys making and loving there own stuff. This is a great way to get in touch with the energies put into the beverages used for cerimonies also. wine was wine until I made it my self.
3,A Christmas Regular but Toward the Bottom,We own at least thirty Christmas movies and they form the nucleus of our holiday celebration. We bought this one last year and would recommend buying from this year's crop first. The actors are fine but the cineamatography is flat and dreary in places. Okay to fill out the season but not on my first team.
3,sweet,"The acting is good, however it does leave one guessing.The actors are a delight and they do maintain the viewers interest. HOWEVER; The ending of this picture leaves one suspended above the play.To me, this film is a fill in the blanks movie that leaves the viewer wondering if this is all there is. Still I found it a delight to watch and a very wholesome picture."
5,Great Christmas Movie,This is a great movie to watch during the Christmas season. I watch it every year at this time. I was glad to find it on the Amazon website in a DVD format. And the pricing was just right for a classic film. I would recommend this film.
4,"For thinking viewers: a pleasing, memorable film","I stumbled upon this and it was available for instant watch. So, there it was! How refreshing to find not only thoughtful dialogue and seasoned super-actors, but a story that echos with reverberations that only somewhat older folks are likely to understand.Actually, I do know people in their late teens & early 20s who would ""get"" this movie, but most younger people are looking for flash gratification and giggles. This film, instead, draws upon real life emotions and reflections. Christmas is merely the frame around which it is built.It is the story of a mirror being held up to two fine people. One of them will emerge with a positive new horizon, and one will need to go forth wishing the taste of happiness she found could have been real. To say more is to spoil the plot. I am glad I found it. It isn't filmed particularly beautifully or I'd have been happy to give it a higher score. But I suspect it had a very low budget. Or?"
4,"Nice story, great characters, good ending","For once, a realistic portrayal of people and relationships, that doesn't have to end with happily-ever-after, but still leaves you with a good feeling. Well worth the time. Characters are very likable."
2,A 'creepy' film!,"(Spoilers!)The screenplay leads you along...a mysterious woman agrees to have Christmas with a lonely widower. She is dysfunctional...he trying to recover utilizing the mechanics of a Christmas holiday. We find she was in it for the money (her husband of a bad marriage pimping her out), while he only wants companionship. She returns to her bad marriage...he starts looking at other women. If you didn't feel alienated already, this flic will do the job. Bypass this one for something that won't make you want to commit suicide!!"
2,Why bother,"I bought this movie because I thought Jason Robards would be good, but I really just wasted my money. By the end of the movie my husband and I looked at each other and asked ""What was the point?"" Did not like the story line and it was too drawn out and slow moving. I will not even pass it along to a friend.The Christmas Wife"
2,Disappointing,"I loved several Jason Robards movies, including The House Without a Christmas Tree, The Holiday Treasure, etc. However was quite disappointed in this movie. While the actors were good, I didn't care for the story line at all."
1,Jason Robards' worst movie,"Or, I guess it would be more accurate to say that it's his only bad movie. I have always loved Jason Robards, so it is a major disappointment to see his great talent wasted on this stupid movie. There's no point and not even any 'feel good' moments, which one expects in a Christmas movie. Awful.Someone said this movie is for ""thinking viewers""?? I've been told that I think TOO much, and I HATED this movie."
1,THE CHRISTMAS WIFE,JUST DIDN'T GET THE POINT OF THIS MOVIE IF THERE WAS ONE! THERE WAS NO PLOT OR POINT!
1,The Christmas Wife,"The video was blank, I contacted the company that mailed it and nothing has been done. I would like a working video or my money back. Thank You P.S You have the website set so I had to rate theproduct, I can't honestly rate something I haven't seen."
1,Worst movie ever!,"This has remained the movie to laugh about. It's such a horrible movie with no plot. In the end, nothing happens. There is no action, no drama, and no comedy. What's left? Nothing. Watching grass grow would be more action filled than this sleeper."
3,Beautiful insight into other people's lives,"Several stories of love. Wanting love; having love; losing love. Young love; old love; new love. Very sweet.I always enjoy a peek into other's lives, especially when they are in far away countries."
5,"""Sticks to the ribs""","I loved this movie - have watched it twice and loved it even more the second time - saw more and felt more. The reviewers who were bored with it, I can understand - it's not a movie for everyone. But the stories are very touching, very real, very haunting - the people and the images keep coming back to me here and there. I recommend it highly for those who like deep stories that don't whack you over the head...the stories sort of unfold out of the characters. The autobiographical story that comes along about half way through adds more weight and depth to the overall (disjointed) stories that the movie first presents...then it ties them all together in a lovely, lyrical way with a satisfying ending. Magnificent."
1,Really Sucks,"This is a quirky, slow movie. It had extremely little dialogue and little background noise. I'm sorry but I couldn't finish it and I can't imagine why it got such good ratings from the rest of the reviewers. This is not for the average person."
5,Good starting point for ADO.NET newbie's,"It starts exactly where I want it to start and guides me through to the more advanced stuff. I saw the Active Directory Stuff, which isn't really me, but I do like the Message Queuing material. That was excellent. I am a fairly decent VB programmer, but the new VB.NET has taken me quite a while to get used to, so I was looking for some good book or other material to teach me ADO.NET, because it is so different to ADO. This book, even with its minor ""mistakes"" is worth every dime."
5,Solid to the core,"Great book with lots of excellent and USEFUL tips, ADO .NET object model tear out card and best of all: Extremely easy reading. This author is going places in the coming years! BTW, chapter 3 is just perfect."
5,Best book on .NET database programming,"This was the book I was looking for, which covers all I need to know on dataaccess using .Net, with great examples.The chapter on message queuing is excellent - the best I have read on the subject so far.Thumbs up!"
1,Another Dissapointed Reader,"After having read two books on VB.Net I assumed this would cover details about programming database applications with VB.Net. Yet after lots of basic material, and a good beginning on VB.Net database information it seemed suddenly done with that and on to other topics such as messages queuing and active directory."
4,Second edition is better,"A lot of companies including Apress tried to saturate the market with .Net books while Visual Studio.Net was in the Beta. This book is an example of that. There are 2 editions for this book, one is based on the Beta 2 and the other on the initial release of Visual Studio.Net (1.0). The Beta book has several noticeable errors and the editing was a rush job. Some of the examples resemble the on-line help and may be screen shots from the on-line help. The on-line help has improved tremendously since the Beta. The 2nd edition has corrected most of those errors and the editor has done a higher quality job. The chapters on disconnected databases (Chapters 9 thru 12) and XML (Chapter 22) are very good for understanding some of the new features of ADO.Net. Microsoft made several changes to ADO.Net and Visual Basic.Net while these products were Beta, so you want to buy the 2nd edition only. The Beta book may mislead you on several key issues."
3,Older Viewing Audience,I have twin boys 18 months old and the Computer Caper part of the DVD is over their heads. They do enjoy the Elmo's World.
3,A pleasant surprise!,"I often think the newer Sesame Street videos don't stack up to the old, but this one is an exception: a great introduction to computers that's entertaining, covers a wide variety of topics, and has an Elmo's world at the end for the diehard toddler fans!The premise (which should spawn some discussion about internet and email safety with parents whose kids are old enough) is that Telly, who has sent his friends a request for replies after setting up a new email address, gets a mysterious email message from a friend who asks him to guess who they are. Telly and other Sesame Street friends search high and low to find out who the mystery emailer is! There are a lot of Sesame Street animated clips and songs to help the plot along, including a GREAT bit with Cookie Monster and Prairie Dawn. If you're raising a budding hacker, this is for you!"
5,"Sound, biblical counsel on courtship and marriage","The advice presented in this book is somewhat dated, but it's GOOD advice. It goes against American culture and the way we typically view dating, marriage, and raising children. It has been revolutionary for me, as a single man, in terms of how I view relationships and marriage. To be honest, it has caused me to completely change my views on godly dating. I recommend it especially for single men and women."
5,Fun!,"I love the way this collection kicks off and ends with ""Lullaby of Broadway,"" and what's sandwiched in bewteen is all good, too. I even like the overblown swoon of the Lettermen on ""Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing."" The real highlights, though, are a live Nat King Cole ""Continental,"" Peggy Lee's ""Days of Wine and Roses,"" Bob Hope's ""Buttons and Bows,"" Tex Ritter's ""Do Not Forsake Me"", a swinging Bobby Darin ""Call Me Irresponsible""...I could go on. If you like this kind of thing, you'll love this CD."
2,A poor book for a fascinating subject,"I bought this book expecting to find well written biographical data of the various heroes of the Fallschirmjäger arm who won the coveted Knights Cross but I was let down by the poor presentation of the subject. The photos are not always from their wartime carrer or are of very poor quality, the text is very short (one or half page for every individual) and the only useful aspect of the book is the trivial data, like date of birth, date of awards, promotions etc. Overall, this is not a good choice for the military history fan."
3,Was not overly pleased,"I was told the book was going to have a dust cover and the quality of the book was so so. Overall, I was not as impressed as I was with other books I recived from different companies."
3,Poor Transfer to DVD,"My copy of the Earthworm Tractors DVD has an oversaturated, distorted soundtrack. This especially evident in the opening fanfare. I find I must turn down the volume to make the DVD listenable. The video quality of the DVD is no better than a VHS copy I have viewed."
3,Poor Transfer to DVD,My copy of Alpha Video's DVD of Joe E. Brown's Earthworm Tractors is marred. The soundtrack is oversaturated. It is very distorted during the opening fanfare. I find I must turn down the volume drastically to make this DVD listenable. The visual quality of this DVD is no better than the VHS version I have borrowed from my local library. I recommend instead the VHS version distributed by Nostalgia Family Video - until a better transfer is offered on DVD
3,Earth worm Tractors,"This is a silly old movie. It was fun to watch, but somewhat predictable. Not one I would put on the top of my list."
2,Too big and poor construction,"This is way too big for its purpose and thus ends up adding too much bulk.The build quality is not great. The battery door makes a poor contact and thus sometimes the controller doesn't work. Also it opens up easily and drops the battery.Finally, the switch is very hard to move, which makes it inconvenient because sometimes is hard to activate single handedly.Aside for that, the audio is good and it does let you peek in to exterior sounds without having to remove your headphones."
1,Junk,"Yeah, this thing is junk. I was scoring ""Freebird"" as a banjo piece with cello accents highlighted in the background and the banjo sound reproduction was terrible, the dotted half notes were in sequence with the 3/8ths and 5/16ths....and don't get me started on how the treble cleff was out of allignment causing my measures (and eventually verses) to slide in to one another. I gave this program 1 star because it didn't give me the option of putting a barfing face for a rating. Yeah, this thing is junk."
5,Finale is What? AWESOME!!!!,"This is the absolute best music notation software out there--don't let the price scare you, it's worth every penny. It make beautiful and professional(this is what BIG music companies use--Hal Lenoard, Warner Bros. to name a couple)sheet music. Every musician, whether you're a teacher, student, or even a musician for a church or religious organization can use this! You can do your own arrangements of music to FIT YOUR GROUP! It uses a user-friendly graphic interface--it looks just like a blank score--you add the rest through it's powerful entry methods."
3,Problems and Solutions in Quantum computing and Quantum information,"It is important to have a book on QC and QIT with concrete themes and problems. It is,also, a source for a theory not always well understood or misinterpreted."
1,Worthless Author,"I have read many self help books, but this book tops the charts as being a complete waste of time and money."
2,....at least Latino actors are getting paid.,"I love movies that feature people of color in Chicago, but this is no ""Love Jones"" or ""Soul Food."" This was just a low-budget ""Boyz N the Hood"" set in Little Village. The actors aren't as hot as the men in ""The Street King."" This movie veres on the long side and has many subplots that lead nowhere. Even the ""drive by"" of the title is not significant. This movie is filled with violent deeds such as gang-initiation rape, murder-suicide, and several homicides, but the acting is so terrible that it becomes funny, rather than sad. Every man in this film sports a leather jacket: c'mon! Chicago isn't that cold! There's one great scene where a mother loses it at her son's funeral. I'm glad Latino actors and Latina actresses are getting hired and paid, but this movie was on the poor side."
2,Drive By,Didn't like because there was too much cursing. Movie would've been better without all those dirty words.
1,Failed very quickly.,"I got less than 30 minutes of use out of this hammer drill before the chuck failed completely. It hammered and drilled very well, but after changing drill bits a few times, the chuck would not release the bit. The bits that came with the tool dulled very quickly. I have used many Makita tools in the past with good results, and this is the first tool from Makita that has disappointed me."
5,EXCELLENT,"Used a discounted Hammer drill and burnt it out.I purchased this Makita because of the price and that it is a Makita drill.I have 2 Makita drills and I have had them for years.I have used this drill to drill through solid concrete block in my home to run cable.The drill did a fantastic job.For the money this is a good buy,I recommend it."
2,Buy a Dewalt,"Light is in a terrible location, the unit heated up to the point where the chuck froze. Do not buy a keyless chuck if you plan on using the drill for extended periods. I think it lasted 4 weeks before the chuck froze. I now keep a keyed chuck Dewalt on my truck. It will heat up to where you can't touch anything metal on the unit and keep working. It was worth the extra $50 over this one."
1,Smoked the motor within 20 minutes,"I bought this drill to replace my cheap old Black & Decker which had finally bit the dust after about 12 years (pretty good for a $30 Chinese drill). I bought it because it seemed nice, powerful, and Assembled (not MADE) in USA.As soon as I went to test it, though, I noticed a lot of run out in the chuck.I did a little drilling, and it seemed to work fine, although it did emit a rather high pitched whine from the motor.I switched to Hammer Mode, and it started to turn, then stuck, and smoked.I took it back, and switched back to an el cheapo Chinese made Black & Decker."
3,Here's the fight card,Fight Card:Chris Botelho vs. Steven RivenbarkChris Kiever vs. Richard MontoyaRocky Batastini vs. Jeremy PetersonJay Hieron vs. Pat HealyJosh Haynes vs. Shonie CarterAaron Brink vs. Fabiano SchernerRoger Huerta vs. Brad BlackburnTravis Wiuff vs. William Hill
4,First step in chess strategy,This book is a first step to the amateur who want to improve. There are good insights on strategy.
2,Ok for advanced player,"This isn't a fireside reading book on chess so you better have your chess board out to understand what is being said.I found it rather difficult to read and for the average player I would recommend Ward Farnwsorth's ""Predator at the Chess Board"" which has more detailed explantions in writing instead of diagrams."
5,Modern Chess Strategy,"I can't say enough about this book,if your below grandmaster level ,this book should help very much giving you the proper strategy on pawn play and postion."
5,This cat knows her stuff :),"As one of the two humans claimed by three cats (and one dog), I can wholeheartedly endorse this book - at one point or another, we've had every one of the techniques set forth here by Momma Cat practiced on us. She's an excellent teacher, this cat, and evidently an awful lot of kittens have read this or have had it read to them :) If you love cats or would just like an insight into the mind of these often mysterious creatures, you will thoroughly enjoy reading this ""manual for kittens""!"
5,A Guide on How to Manipulate Humans,"This manual for kittens, strays, and homeless cats was translated by the gifted writer, Paul Gallico, after it was typed by a wise cat. The result is alternately uncanny and heartwarming. Uncanny because I recognized every ploy that my cat, Duchess, uses to wheedle from me a life of incredible comfort, and heartwarming because it portrays the wonderfully affectionate nature of cats. After you read this, you will never again view a cat in the same manner. They are calculating creatures, but they are also full of love for you. The lessons in this manual are enhanced wonderfully by dozens of terrific photographs of a cat named Cica. Don't miss this splendid book."
3,"Helpful Kit, But Case Has Design Flaws","This kit is a must for any first year organic chemistry student. I liked having the different colored straws representing the different atoms. The things I disliked about this kit is that you have to cut the straw lengths yourself and hope you don't make a mistake. Second, there is no ""jack"" for sulfur atoms. Lastly, the kit is not designed to house the final cut straws properly and it is not designed for portability. You need to keep some sort of rubber bands or clamp on the plastic case to keep the lid from coming off; terribly designed, but very helpful in the long run."
4,Excellent Toddler bed,"I bought this Toddler bed for my 1 1/2 yr old daughter and she loves it. She even put herself down for a nap in it. It wasn't too difficult to put together and it's beautiful. It's low enough to the ground where if she rolls out, like she does often, she could really care less.My only issue with the bed are the guard rails. I think they should be a little taller and a little longer. My daughter's pillow is about as tall as the rails and is about 1/2 as long, which makes it easier for her to roll out of bed. Since she sleeps in about the center of the bed and flip flops some at night.Other than that I love it. I even bought the nightstand to match it."
2,Blah,"This film suffers from a lack of everything: interesting characters, good-looking scenery, and most conspiciously missing is the scares. The story goes on and on and really doesn't do much at the end. The final scenes feel a bit tacked on. Another thing that really gets me is the over-reliance on CGI. Sorry, but computerized ghosts are just not very frightening. Yes there are some extremely hot (but totally and completely clothed all of the time) Thai women, and there are a couple of gory scenes, but this is does not to Thai horror justice. There are much better movies to see. The Victim is just cashing in on the success of its older, bigger and better siblings - The Eye, Shutter, and soon-to-be-released Alone. Now those are Thai horror movies worth your time and money."
3,Could be better,"There are better books about there on these subjects. However, Jennings has written an eye-opening book although it is seriously undermined by poor editing and some inaccurate facts."
1,Hmmm,"I must admit I haven't read the book but I've read Jenning's other work ""A Mouthful of Rocks"" and, if he lies and exagerates like he does in that work, then I'd question the veracity of what he writes about here.One of the other reviewers talks about Jennings honesty? I served with him in the Legion and his account is far from honest.Don't get me wrong. I'm not for one minute attempting to belittle what went on in Rwanda but Jennings may not be the best man to report on it."
3,Material for fans only.,"Once you get to analize the live footage, you will realize that it does not match with the image provided by KMFDM through their art and albums, meaning it is not specially thrilling. The videos are ok, just as you migth know."
3,It falls short to expected,"There are a couple of useful ideas within the book. Advantages and pitfalls of simplicity are outlined and some paths featured. Nevertheless, as it's common, when you end up the chapters little remains. The book is too much dense and padded out. It's a contradiction with the issue of the book. There are 10 rules at the end that summarise the ideas. If some pages with the useful points were added on to this summary, the book could be reduced to 50 useful pages. It's a pity not to practice what one preaches. As stated by himself: ""One reason for complexity is trying to show deep knowledge on an issue""."
2,This book is way too long for its contents,"Ironic that a book on simplicity violates its own principles several times. Even though this book is printed on every other page (with ""insights"" on the even-numbered pages), it takes too long to make its points. There were several interesting concepts in the book, but not enough to justify more than 20 pages or so. Additionally, de Bono oversimplifies (something he cautions us against) by making blanket statements that reveal his lack of understanding regarding industry practices he is critiquing. de Bono himself has developed brilliant theories that have been widely applied around the world, but this book isn't the best source for discovering those ideas."
3,"Beauty, profundity -- but not enough clarity","This is a sonically beautiful, intensely moving performance. Giulini, and the players and singers under his direction, present a lyrical, dignified and thoughtful view of the B minor Mass. There is, however, one major drawback: Bach's complex polyphonic textures are too often muddied. This is not, as some people might think, an inevitable result of the use of ""modern"" instruments and a large chorus: Eugen Jochum, conducting the very same choir and orchestra, achieved much greater clarity in both of his recordings. Giulini's performance proves that there is much to this music besides polyphony, that it can move even when this aspect is not sufficiently attended to. But polyphony IS an essential aspect, and it ultimately enriches expression as well. Giulini's relative failure in this respect sadly mars what is in many other ways a great performance."
3,No clasp.,Got the product timely and the quality is fine; my only complaint is that there is no clasp on the necklace. Just be aware when you purchase.
4,The Readers' Digest Version Of The Rolling Stones Tale,"There is enough material in the Rolling Stones' history to come up with something similar to ""The Beatles' Anthology"". Until that happens ""25 X 5"" is a great condensed version. The numerous clips of the band in newsreels, on Ed Sullivan's show, on pop music shows of old, at press conferences, and much more are treasures. I enjoyed listening to Bill Wyman, Charlie Watts, and Mick Taylor giving their perspectives instead of the usual Jagger and Richards. The performance clips that capture the band at various stages over the years are equally entertaining."
2,Very basic about SCO.,"Just the basis about SCO and admin. If you don't know anything about computer and SCO, this is book is good for you."
4,Love It!,I wish we put this together sooner. I love to walk and this is a wonderful stroller for walkers. I did not want to spend a lot of money on a second stroller for walking but this was a great price and well worth it. It is so smooth and easy to turn. My 7 month old loves the steering wheel.I have to admit there are some downsides. It does not fit in the trunk of my car and it is difficult to recline.
5,Great Stroller,"I love this stroller. We just received it as a shower gift. I like it much better than the ""Limited"" version. We had trouble fitting a infant car seat into the Limited, but have no problem getting the infant seat to fit securely into this version. It was so easy to assemble."
4,Not a jogging stroller.,I bought this stroller so my kids could take the baby outside and to walk down to the neighbors and it wouldn't mess up my Graco stroller. It is a good stroller for the park and walking up and down the road. The only bad thing is it leans to the left a little bit but other than that it is a nice stroller.
1,Beware,The Back support on the stroller from the front looks nice and comfy for baby but beware the back of the seats material is thin and the card board backing inside the seat split through the cover and now there is no back to the seat! I spent alot of money for this stroller and got to use it twice! Since I have had this problem I have found 4 other people who have shared the same problem and only with this model. I tried going to JeepBaby.com for assistance and their email address is not a known domain and the number they have down doesnt work. Becareful!! Luckily my 10 month old daughter wasent in the seat when it gave in. I have had to sew the cover three times now and the material is so thing it just continues to split open and tear more and more.
3,"THIS IS NOT THE ""LIMITED"" VERSION WITH MUSIC AND TOY","FYI: Many people are writing reviews on the wrong product. Toys R Us carries the Jeep Libery Urban Terrain Stroller, shown here. Babies R Us carries the Jeep Liberty Limited Urban Terrain Stroller, which has the music plug ins, and steering wheel clip on toy. There is a $40 price difference in these two strollers. When searching online, only this version shows up under strollers, but if you type ""Jeep"" into the search field, both versions will be listed. I own the Limited version, and have posted my review under that listing."
4,Jeep Sport Stroller,"This stroller is better than the higher priced Jeep Liberty Limited Urban Terrain Stroller (with music on the go - never used this feature). I purchased the higher priced stroller first but had to return it after the air would not stay in the tires. Also, the canopy on the Jeep Liberty Limited Urban Terrain Stroller is mesh causing the sun to always be in the childs eyes.The Jeep Liberty Urban Terrain Stroller in Royal Blue has thick, hard foam tires. No more flats! It also has material for the canopy creating more shade. It does not have a toy, but small straps around the canopy allow you to hang toys. I did jog with both strollers and had no problems. If you have a long stride, your feet may hit the basket. My husband is tall(6'4"") and an adjustable handle would be better for him. I'm only giving it four stars because it would be nice to have a seat that reclines more for sleeping. Other than that, I use it everyday and I'm glad I purchased it."
5,Strolling,I researched and read all reviews before adding this to my registry. This is the ultimate best stroller around. Our evening walks are now complete. Can hardly wait to take it with us on vacation.
2,It flipped over with my baby in it!,"I initially loved the Jeep 3-wheel stroller-until it tipped over with my baby in it! The first time I was at the mall paying for my items and my son leaned on the front foot rest and the stroller fell sideways and my baby's head skidded on the floor (she was buckled in). About a week later I was walking down a slanted driveway and I had to catch it before it completely tipped over again! I am returning the stroller, and have contacted the manufacturer so the issue can be corrected immediately."
1,Not Safe! Do Not Buy!,"I put this on my registry after reading reveiws online. I found out too late that the reviews here refer to a completely different model. This is a basic stroller, there is no padding in the seat, there is no place to plug anything in, there are no toys included...just a plain Jane model. They tray in front does not stay latched at all. My son too fell prey to the shoestrings used to secure the back of the seat. When you put your child in the seat, the weight of the baby on the shoestrings pulls them tight-and you might as well be rubbing a curtain rod against his head. My son ended up at the emergency room...AND BOY DO THE DOCTORS LOOK CLOSELY AT YOU WHEN YOUR CHILD HAS A HEAD INJURY! I had to send my husband home to get the stroller to prove how he hurt his head. The lump stayed on his head for over two weeks. He cried out of pain for a few days. No donating this one...it went straight to the dump. My strong advice....DON'T BUY THIS FOR YOURSELF OR ANYONE ELSE."
3,Not a jogging stroller,"We ordered this stroller at Amazon.com after it came up as one of three ""recommended"" when we searched for ""jogging strollers"" online. The reviews were great so I went ahead and ordered it for my daughter-in-law. When it arrived, however, the box was clearly marked with ""This is not a jogging stroller."" I was surprised since it came up in the search that way. We ended up sending it back to Amazon not because it was a bad stroller but because it could not be used for jogging. I also recommended that Amazon include that disclaimer in the description for this product."
1,Becareful!!!!,"I got this stroller for my shower... my daughter is now 2 months.. i wanted it because i love to go for walks... well, the left shock sinks down and pulls to the left... and the worst part is, it's so Heavy!!! I have a truck, but it is very difficult to put in the back seat... so i have to put it in the bed... it either lays on the wheels and the tray...(which scratches), or it lays on where you put your child...ugh dirty... I am very dissapointed with it...if it didn't get scratched for transporting it, i would have returned it..."
1,Do not buy this stroller,"This stroller tips over constantly. when my daughter leans forward it tips, when you try to cross the street the wheels get stuck in the gutter and over it goes! I tried to return it and they would only even exchange, same problems with the second one and now I have tried to return the second one and since it was an even exchange they are using my original purchase date and tell me they cannot help me since too much time has lapsed. The manufacturer is of no help! Do not buy this item it is very unsafe and should be recalled."
3,A lesson for everyday life,"I have read this book and the very first time, it is true that it gives an impression of overwhelming death and sorrow. The protagonist, Vanessa, comes into contact with life, that is REAL life and she just finds it hard to cope. But it is a story which is just so incredibly true-to-life that any one can identify themselves with the main character. It is only many, many years after that Vanessa understands what had confused her when she was 10 : her grandfather, so much feared and respected, and all the deaths which she had to endure in her family. If you have ever been at that stage, losing some of the people you loved in your heart of hearts, you will understand what Vanessa had to go through and see yourself in her position in front of new things as painful as death. It is not morbid at all, it just shows you that your family is there to help, but that in any case, everything's not hunky-dory!!!"
3,this book was insightful yet lacked detail,"this book did not quite meet my expectations like other works written by margaret laurence. it lacked in detail and plot development. i would recommend this book to persons not familiar with ms. laurence's style but to those who are fans of her literature, my advice is to stay away from this one. thanks ms. mackinnon"
3,"Insightful, realistic, but not very exciting","I had to read this book for an english project and I found it slighltly boring. The setting was a little depressing and Vanessa's grandfather was very ingnorant and frustrating. The book was realistic and enjoyable though. Her responces towards the several deaths could have been expressed with a little more sorrow and sadness. Her aunt Adna was a nice uplifting character. Overall the book is good, but not the most exciting. It deals with many deaths in the family and is a good for some one who is dealing with a death."
2,fields of wheat,"Why are students constantly subjected to boring narratives about prairie boredom and depression? I live in the prairies and don't see why anyone would want to capture the soul-crushing essence of it all. If you are free reading, pick a book that will improve your state of well being rather than dragging you into the flat quagmire of prairie realism. However, as required reading there are definately worse books that professors could assign you! ie. double hook!"
1,Not accetable for a teen,This book was the worst book i have ever read. I had to read it for an english project and man it was boring. It had no point to it at all and it was so confusing it didn't make any sense. I found that the prarie idea was a bad idea to write about becuase it doesnt capture a teen audience and it was so confusing becuase it jumped from year to year going back in years and then to two years alter and characters would leave and then never come back. The eight stories in one book just made it too much to take in at once.
1,This book isnt very good,"i was forced to read this book by our public schools which are strongly influanced in theocracy i think that this book has too many references to ""THE GREAT LORD"" well i think this is wrong and obviously i didnt enjoy this book it was too boring and really really slow at most parts its a bunch of short stories which have been writen over a period of time. Margaret laurence isnt a good writer, i personally think that my review has more intelect and insight than any one of her novels"
2,A holiday insomnia cure,"The theory behind this CD series (also focusing on Metallica, AC/DC and others) is that you can take a hard-rockin' band's signature music and give it a little holiday makeover for all the good boys and girls to enjoy under der Tannenbaum. But the execution is a schmaltzy, sappy reinterpretation of songs including ""Good Riddance (Time of Your Life),"" ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams,"" ""Welcome to Paradise,"" ""Jesus of Suburbia"" and ""Warning"" into something you wouldn't even find playing in the lobby of the Hotel Ennui in Dullsville, N.J. Oh, and then they add metronomic jingle bells in the background for that extra holiday oomph.... Sorry, I'm afraid I started to nod off. I gotta go find something peppier to liven things up -- maybe a little Neil Sedaka or Karen Carpenter would do the trick.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(net) editor"
3,Instrumental only.,"It says ""you'll be singing about the Green Days of Christmas"" on the product description, but be warned, there are no vocals on this cd. This is basically a cd of Green Day songs recorded with a Christmas sound. Most of the rhythym is provided by sleigh bells, and the vocal melodies have been replaced by chimes and flutes. While they claim these songs would ""make Irving Berlin blush,"" there is really nothing edgy about these arrangements. The only guitars in this album are muted in the background, and the drumming is limited mostly to large orchestral drums. Overall it's not a bad cd, and in some ways it really helps bring out the quality of Green Day's melodies. However, the song selection is so/so and the tempos don't change much from song to song. It's an okay listen, and you can always sing along if you know the words, but after a while this album gets kind of boring and it doesn't really have the feel of a Christmas album."
3,Ok for what it is- an attempt for someone to cash in,"Having heard about this through a friend, I had to give this a try. I figure that at the worst it would be something to laugh about & at the best, this would be one of the better types of muzak. Let's face it- any version of a song that isn't done by an orchestra or sung along to is muzak, or at least this CD is.All that aside, I wasn't entirely dissapointed by this cd. It's cute, but it's not really anything to write home about. The songs just lack the edge that made the songs great in the first place & like one other review said, it's a good cure for insomnia.Bottom line? This just isn't Christmasy. It takes more than a few bells, flutes & a slowed down beat to make a song seem more holiday-ish. I'd recommend that the average buyer listen to the free samples & then just pick which songs they liked the best. Honestly though? I'd skip this & go for a true alternative Christmas album like ""Maybe this Christmas""."
4,Great Supplement to Lessons,"My daughter has been pitching for less than a year and takes weekly pitching lessons from a pitching instructor. This DVD is a nice supplement to the hands-on lessons and reinforces many of the same principles by allowing her to watch drills and pitches to understand the finer points of how the motions should look. While we have just gotten started with the DVD, I also plan to video my daughter's pitching motion so that we can look at it in a side to side comparison with the DVD. It has also helped me as a dad to better understand the exact motions of drills, and to identify specific drills that will be helpful to my daughter."
2,Cheap,Inferior quality. I would not purchase again. The picture is 10 times better than the actual product.Very cheap material.
5,great cheats,"i got these cleats for $50 at amazon. they are the best cleats i have ever bought. I am not sure they are worth $150 which is what they are asking for them right now but if you will use them every day, they are worth it. i kick somewhat better in them and they clean very easily. this is a big deal for me because i travel a lot and my team's home field is constantly muddy. the interchangeable parts of the shoe seem cool but i don't actually change parts of it depending in where i am playing. it takes a little while to actually do it."
1,Do NOT buy these shoes!!!!,"These shoes are a joke! My 16 year old son plays varsity for his high school and on 2 Select teams. As it is for everyone, money is tight but, we bought these for him. (Did not buy from Amazon, purchased locally at a soccer store.) One of the cleats ""stripped"" in the first 3 weeks making the shoes totally worthless. I contacted Addidas and they have seen no reason to talk to us. Took them back to the store where they were bought and they were going to ""fix"" them. Told them not to bother. We got a different, better pair of shoes and a gift card for the trouble. I don't care how much my son might believe in another pair of Addidas but, I refuse to buy any of their products ever again because they have NO customer service."
5,Great Product - Very Fast Shippment,"As always, Gund makes a great product... it's exactly what I expected and why I chose this one. The seller is actually the reason I'm writting this review though... I had expected this item to come in the mail about 10 days after I ordered it (I chose the cheapest shipping) but was very happy to see it on my doorstep within 5 days. The seller had very fast turn around on my order and I'd certainly recommend them."
5,great and cheap,"Like these boards for use in collage and painting. Good price too. Painted an X on the back with mod podge to keep it from warping, don't know if that was necessary but why not?"
5,Stupendous trio recording,"This is a stunning, stupendous album. The playing is tight, delicious.(How can I say it at the six or seven stars level?!!) I keep goingback to this jazz album with great satisfaction. And it wasn't anaccident. I heard the players live at an east coast festival afterthe recording, and it was just delicious. Does muted bop trumpet,guitar, and bass work as a trio? In these hands, incredibly well!"
2,not for my glasses,"I got this item hoping that my ""car sunglasses"" (never drive without them) will be in one spot and easy to find in my car. Unfortunately they're too big for this holder. I guess it's for glasses with very thin rims."
3,Sunglass Holder,"This unit clips to the sunvisor of your car. It works relatively well, but needs to have a more secure closure when sunglasses are inserted. I had to attach Velcro strips to keep it closed."
3,Good Collection,This is a nice DVD. It would have been Excellent if it consisted of the complete 21 appeareances of the Supremes on the Ed Sullivan.
3,Region code?????,Amazon's description is crucially incomplete. Could anyone who actually bought this tell me if it's region 2 or region free????
3,BEEN THERE...DONE THAT,"I bought this DVD thinking that maybe for once we would get all the Supremes performances from the legendary Ed Sullivan Show. Most of these performances have been included on other DVDs but the worst omission of them all is not including their performance of ""Someday We'll Be Together"" from the farewell performance of Diana Ross and the Supremes. If you are going to market this DVD as The Best of The Supremes on the Ed Sullivan Show, why would you not include that performance?? A missed opportunity to say the least. That being said, Motown needs to put both TCB and GIT on Broadway on DVD. Hope someone is listening."
1,Same old stuff....nothing new for fans,"These all have been seen before. That last song without the legendary Ross is the only one not released. Don't buy...not worth the money. Hold off until better, rarer video is released (Funny Girl, TCB, etc.)"
1,"Where Is ""Someday....."" ????","Why isn't ""Someday We'll Be Together"" on this? It was their final performance on the show. It seems they are leaving out alot....."
3,these are newer scooby movies and i don't think that they are as much fun,"while i don't like these movies that much(the fun just isn't there like the old ones),my boys like them and so we keep these in our van also for long trips."
3,"Lots of foam, no bubbles and lackluster scent","This is a nice foaming bath, more creamy than bubbles. The scent is off , but the package is really small and kind of expensive for what you get. I wouldn't purchase this in this scent again."
2,bad camera man,this is the most annoying of the bellydance superstars videos-the performers are tremendously talented -why must the camera constantly change views continually? a long shot for one second then a closeup for a second then a ridiculous view from above for a second -you cant follow any of the movement jumping around like that-the stage lighting seemed like something psychedelic from the 60's -totally unneccessary and didnt add anything to the performance-would not have ever gotten this dvd if i had seen it ahead of time
5,FANTASTIC PERFORMANCES,"There are fantastic perfomances on this DVD. Overall the camera angles were good on this DVD. They didn't wander too much. There is a variety of perfomances from all the stars. There is everything from cabaret, tribal, egyptian, and even polynesian style dancing. No extras really. Always disspointing. I saw the live show in Los Angeles in 2005 and this DVD brought great memories from the show. Definitely worth getting if you cant make it to a show or if you want to make sure you never forget it."
1,Junk,"Save your money. I purchased this mainly for the phone case. Although they stated it would fit my Katana, I have to SHOVE it in, which put a huge scratch right across the camera lense. When I got a call, I couldn't get the phone out of the darn case since it was so wedged in there and kept missing calls!! It also doesn't look anything like the photo. The photo is a hot pink case which appears to be a decent quality. This pale pink peice of junk they sent wasn't anything like the photo. If the case is any indication, I'm not even going to try that car charger. It might blow up the phone!!"
5,this was a great price,The only negative thing i have to say is along w this item another item was also ordered and i recieved this one but not the other...otherwise this was a great buy...wonderful price and great product!!
3,Baldessarini,It smells like Baldessarini and does the job. Good price too and the delivery was prompt. The only fault I can find is that the photo and description clearly states its made by Hugo Boss! But nowhere on the bottle or packaging I received says it. Worrying as there's so many fake products about. The seller reassured me its genuine and offered me a refund so I decided to keep it. Have used it a few times the past few weeks and I'm happy.
4,Good renditions of great oldies,"Great presentations of some of the best, and best known, Rodgers and Hart. But I was disappointed that Dancing on the Ceiling was absent. Also, I was hoping to find some R&H with the Andrews Sisters, especially Sing for your Supper. Can't have it all, but this is a great CD with great artists."
5,Prophetic Tale?,"EXCELLENT adventure novel on a very timely topic: foreign terrorism on American soil. The author skillfully presents a chillingly plausible scenario, and garnishing it with a lineup of quirky and likeable characters, develops a plot that unfolds like a modern-day film noire. Whenever I thought I knew what would happen next, I'd turn the page and be completely surprised.If anyone knows of any other books by this author, I'd like to know."
2,"Great idea, but.....","This item has the potential to be great, but fails for the following reasons. The speakers hum noisily when the unit is plugged in. The unit also picked up a radio station even though no radio was built in. The unit uses loose USB wire and speaker wires to conect to the Motorola Q. This is unattractive and cumbersome when wanting to use the unit. The worst part was that when everything was connected and I played music the unit hummed so loudly that I could barely understand the music. The seller refunded my money but I was stuck with hefty shipping charges. If the bugs were worked out this may be a good buy. For now I suggest not buying this. Two stars because the idea is great."
2,A rather out of date guide to starting an online business,"The book features some very good content, while I recommend it, I have to say like many computer text books they can become out of date as quickly as overnight. The book is well orgranised into easy to read sections and contains many useful links, unfortunately many of those links are now deak links. Another dated part of the book is about promoting your site with search engines, these day search engines have cought on to the fact that they can make money by making people pay to have their site listed, so if you want to have your site listed on one search engine it can cost several hundred dollars, gone are the days of adding your site for free"
5,NEEDED FOR BEING THE ONLY MISC. METAL TEXTBOOK,"For the first time there is a book on the market that covers Miscellaneous Iron and other Metals, such as aluminum and bronze. Steel stairs are also extensively covered. This book should be revised for actuality, in a new edition, regarding estimations, because it dates back to 1989."
2,Outdated Textbook,"I guess I didn,t realize that I was buying an outdated textbook as opposed to something newer. There was literally nothing in the book of any usefullness. My fault for not recognizing it's age."
5,great resource; great price,"Wonderful images, practical text. Made THE difference in my cell bio performance in my first year of med school. thanks for the great product and prompt delivery."
1,Little Pet Shop Big Disappiontment,I brought this for my niece.She loves dogs so I thought she would like taking care of this virtual doggie.While it's easy to feed and brush the dog.You have to press the charms into the side slots hard.Plus if you lose the charmsyou can no longer do these actions.As for the games to play.You need to go toa website to find out about them and what they are.If you don't have a computer your out of luck.The graphics are small and fuzzy.I would not recommend this toy.
3,Promotional video for Desert Roses!,"I think the Desert Roses are awsome but when purchasing a documentary I was hoping to see the history of American Belly Dance which should include American Tribal. This video is completely about how the Belly Dance Superstars were formed, which is fine if you market it that way. Rachel Brice's name is heavily used in the advertisement but she's barely seen on the video. Where's the history of American Belly Dance? Where's the Tribal? Where is all the stuff that makes American Belly Dance What it is today? I love all the ladies on this video but there are so many moore icons of our art. This is NOT a documentary on Belly Dance but rather a documentary on one mans vision to make international belly dance superstars."
4,All about the Superstars,"I rented this DVD from our local library and have considered buying it. Overall, it's a good documentary. I agree with some of the previous posters in that, it's definetly makes you think that Miles Copeland is all about money when it comes to belly dance. I enjoyed seeing the interviews with the stars. The cd that comes with it is great in my opinion. Some of the same old same old music, but some newer stuff that I haven't heard. :)"
4,Audio Visions Review,"As a huge Kansas fan I was very satisfied with this album. After reading the other reviews listed, it's obvious all the previous critics are familiar with Kansas. Although this album does not achieve the perfection of Leftoverture and Point of Know Return, it is still classic KANSAS! . There seems to be a definite separation between Livgren(songwriter) and Walsh(vocalist). No One Together is brilliant; Got to Rock On, Hold On, received air play. But the one song I'm suprised no one mentioned which is the best on the album is ""relentless"". Although Relentless received minimal air play, I think it should have went top 10. Don't Open Your eyes and Curtain of Iron are also well orchestrated."
3,"1980 Album, Are Kansas At A Crossroad?","For me Audio-Visions is an interesting listern rather a top notch, must have recording. For example I don't think it can compare with Leftoverture, Point Of No Return or Vinyl Confesstions.What is crystal clear is Kerry Livgren's desire to write songs regarding his Christian faith in Relentless, Hold On and No One Together.Meanwhile the other main songwriter, Steve Walsh, is writing of painful relationship breakdowns in No Room For A Stranger and Back Door.The majority of the album, while maintaining high production standards, does not sound distinctive enough to stand out from the many other rock bands of that time.However for fans who want all their releases, this will be an essential purchase."
4,The last album by the original group. (Until 2000).,"""Audio-Visions"" #26 (1980) was Kansas' last studio album by the original group. Steve Walsh, Kerry Livgren, Dave Hope, Robbie Steinhardt, Rich Williams and Phil Ehart put out a very listenable platter here. Walsh and Livgren were butting heads about which direction Kansas should go at the time. Walsh released ""Schemer-Dreamer"" #124 a pure rock release later in 1980, as did Livgren ""Seeds Of Change"", more of a Christian based release, but with some good rock undertones). Back to Audio-Visions"", they would release 2 hit singles in ""Hold On"" #40 and ""Got To Rock On"" #76. After these two releases, they had great album tracks in ""Curtain Of Iron"", ""Relentless"", ""Anything For You"", ""Loner"" and the Steinhardt led ""Don't Open Your Eyes"". Not a bad record from a band going through some turbulent times."
3,Not what I expected...,"This is not a funny commentary on raising children as I expected. While I agree with many of the author's basic principles, it was really more of a rant than anything else. I didn't learn anything from the book that I didn't already know (yes, I let my children rule my life more than she thinks I should, but not nearly as much as shown in this book and certainly a lot less than many people around me). I expected a much funnier look at how parents give their lives to their kids."
5,Hand these out in the maternity ward,"Not only is this just HYSTERICAL, but she is dead-on. Come on parents... TAKE CONTROL!My husband I are laughing out loud. Even my teenage daughter finds it funny.I think I'll need copies, set aside, for when my daughters are mommies."
1,parenting advice with a twist of sadistic humor,"After reading part of this book, I put it down. Frankly, the author takes things a bit too far. As a loving parent (who by the way enjoys a great life of my own as well) I can't stomach such advice as cooking meal after meal of strikingly unpalatable food, ""until their tummies rumble""...and they'll eat just about anything...or centering a child's first birthday party around adult drinking. Maybe I just don't get it, but this to me is more twisted than funny."
2,Cheap Imitation of Miss Manners,"The title is hilarious, but once you get past this, it's a second-rate [version] of a writing style perfected by Judith Martin in books like ""Miss Manner's Guide to Raising Perfect Children."" Mellor's comic references to children serving their hard-working parents cocktails are amusing at first, but soon grow tiresome. Mellor comically enshrines alcohol consumption as the ultimate adult pleasure. But she ignores the unfunny, dangerous and skyrocketing issue of binge drinking among teenagers, which this book could inadvertently reinforce. I realize Mellor's intent is not serious, but it underscores the wrong values. This book would never sell if it were called, ""The Three-Marlboro Playdate"" and emphasized the joys of parents smoking cigarettes together while their well-bred children provided ashtrays, dumped the butts, and then ran along to play among themselves.(...)"
5,Buy Several Copies!! I give them out like appetizers!,"Bought every copy in the bookstore after reading the chapter titles. Now that the bookstore is out, I'm here buying several more. I am a stay at home Mom who had three boys in 3 1/2 years. I didn't need the advice as much as I needed to laugh. The advice is great too. I love it. The humor was just what the OB ordered. Raise a glass to anyone who challenges the child centric bull@#&% to put forth a child raising treatise that has a senisble logic that adults have rights too."
4,enjoyed but a little extreme,"I really enjoyed this book but felt that the author was a bit extreme. It was a bit darker and more acidic than I thought but still amusing with some good points beneath the sarcasm. Not for everyone, though."
5,Hilarious,"This is not a ""how-to"" book. If you are looking for a good laugh and break from all of the advice books out there, this is the book for you. I read it in about an hour, and laughed out loud! It is a refreshing take on parenting. This would be a great addition to a girlfriend's welcome-home package (which would include a bottle of champagne and a gift certificate for a manicure and pedicure, of course)!!"
3,soft n smooth,The brush set was a little smaller than I expected but great fro travel. The feel of it against my skin was amazing.I did not expect it to be so smooth and soft. I really love it!!!
4,So very different-quite compelling,"Penny Vincenzi has written a very entertaining different story. The characters are dimensional, with very real touching story lines. The story itself it quite fascinating---I thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved the ending--the reader has to use their own creativity a bit which is wonderful."
3,Review,The story is rather involved and kept me in suspense right to the end. Only disappointment was not actually bring back Cressida into the story to close the gap. Good storyline.
5,sturdy and reliable,"I got tired of buying scales every couple of years at the store because the previous one went on the fritz.. so i broke down and bought the HealthOmeter. It gives me an accurate reading every time and it will still be around when i am gone because these things just don't break. If it becomes off balance, it is simple to balance it back into place. I have only had to adjust mine once over the last year and a half and it only took about 1 minute to do.. and thats only because the kids like to play on it everyday and pretend to be weiging themselves.. if you love having a reliable weight reading, this scale is for you."
4,Great scale,This scale met my expectations. Easy to put together and easy to use. I checked it for calibration and it is right on the money. no adjustment required.
5,Excellent product,The Health O Meter 402LB Physician Balance Beam Scale is exactly what I wanted. I have been unhappy with normal bathroom scales and wanted something more dependable. The scale was easy to assemble and is a perfect addition to our exercise room.
5,Pleasantly surprised,"Scale was exactly what I was looking for.. I have spent 100s over the years buying scales from diff stores, but decided to finally spend the money on a ""real"" doctor's scale and I have not been disappointed. The delivery occurred in very short time, so I was able to have it wrapped in time for Christmas."
4,HEALTH O METER,I really like my new HEALTH O METER. It is accurate and easy to keep track of my weight loss. Also the bar to measure my height.
4,Better than any spring scale,It is Better than any spring scale and more accurate. Doesn't give you different numbers each time you step on and off the scale as spring scale does
4,Just like the Dr's office.,"Excellent scale. I gave it 4 stars because the numbers could be larger, so I have to put on my glasses to see it."
5,scale,Easy to assemble. The scale is perfectly balanced and offers accurate weight. We tested with 5 pound hand-held weights and without weights and the accuracy was spot on.
2,Not up to his good stuff,"I am a loyal Elmore fan so it was difficult for me to rate this book. It just didn't measure up to a lot of his other work. It seems very dated. The style isn't crisp and edgy. The characters are pretty dull. In all, a very disappointing buy."
5,Between a Rock and a Hard Place,"In the unknown man Leonard has Jack Ryan a process server who is one of the best in the business looking for a man known only as ""Unknown Man #89"". Not truly unknown a few know him to well. A blonde hates him with a passion and a very bad guy wants him in hell. This all makes it hard for Jack Ryan as he has to get between those two people in order to capture #89. A very good read."
1,Scrooge is still Seymour Hicks,"Collectors of different interpretations of ""A Christmas Carol"" should beware. If you already own the Seymour Hicks version (available asScroogeor as part ofA Christmas Carol (Ultimate Collector's Edition)(B/W & Color)), you don't want this. It is the same film. Why Hicks' name is omitted in the cast listing at the top of this page, I don't know. The movie itself is not bad - I am rating it poorly because of the major omission in the cast listing."
2,Looks Better Than Image DVD But Not As Complete!,"I agree that Legend Film's version of SCROOGE (1935)is visually better than the Image Entertainment's version, however, be forewarned that the restored Lengend version is the shorter more common public domain version found on dozens of different video and dvd labels. The Image Entertainment version is 18 minutes longer and is derived from a complete print provided by Blackhawk Films. While I give Legend's DVD ""TWO STARS"", the Image DVD I give ""Four Stars""."
2,Recorded at wrong speed,"This version of Scrooge has made the now all-too-common mistake of running the reels a half a beat too fast when recording it. I think folks want the initial music to be livlier, and they set the speed based on that, rather than the moving and speaking of the characters. Consequently, the beautifully clear print is spoiled by the annoying speed of the dialogue, which makes everyone seem exceedingly nervous. My search for a watchable copy of this movie continues!"
1,NOT THE 78 MINUTE VERSION - INCORRECT PIC,"The product received was of the 61 minute version not the full 78 minute one advertised here. Also the one received came as a double feature, the one advertised and picture here is not double feat. ~A~"
2,Should have looked at length of picture!,"This is the 60 minute version of the film. I'm a bit dissappointed in myself for not rerading that in the description. Also, I was very unimpressed with the transfer. Very VERY dark. I didn't view the colorized version, though, so it may be better. The movie itself is the earliest talking version of the book. Perhaps there's a better, complete print available somewhere."
4,Scrooge in B&W and Color 1930's,"Considering how old this movie is, the clarity ws not bad. The ator who played scrooge was wonderful and is up there with Alistair Sim and the rest of them. Nice movie to have on your bookshelf."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!,"Colorization, clarity DO NOT matter when 18 essential, vital minutes are hacked out of this version. I have the full movie as released by Image in 2002: try to get this one, if possible. And if you expect to find the full version as an extra on the ULTIMATE Sim version released last year or so...don't be fooled. They offer up the abridged version likewise.This release, though, is a total travesty. Two of the BEST scenes in this version are NOT to be found herein: the Ghost of Christmas Present's tour over London and beyond and the wonderfully touching ending to the film, unique in all the Scrooge versions I know of. ( Please see my review on Amazon of this version when LEGEND first released it last year solely in black and white, but truncated all the same, for further information.)"
2,Extremely poor quality edited version,"Having purchased other colorized dvd's from Legend Films, I was anxious to see this little 1935 gem in color. Legend Films has a patented process that makes colorization look much better and more natural than others. As mentioned by other reviewers, this is a heavily edited version of the film with 18 crucial minutes deleted. It would be more aptly titled ""HIGHLIGHTS FROM A CHRISTMAS CAROL"". The biggest disappointment is the picture quality. One feels like they're watching through a layer of gauze or through a screen door (the picture is VERY fuzzy). There is also a nearly constant ""flicker"" to the picture. It is a very poor so-called ""restoration"". Legend Films really let me down on this one. For the best quality full 78 minute restored version of this classic, buy the one from Image Home Video."
5,Super Mood Movie!,"If you are just not in that right Christmas sprite and because you think everything has gone commercialized and no one knows the ture meaning of Christmas anymore, then this is the movie for you. It brings back the old days in you and and renews the youth in you. I remember going to see this movie, it seems like every year at Christmas when I was young, with my Dad and Mom. It is a little tough on the eyes because it is in black and white and we are custom to all the new technologies of the world. However it put me back into that old Christmas sprite where it is all about families getting together to celebrate the good news. Not Just how many and how much we find under the Christmas tree, Super Movie to put you in this Mood."
1,Very poor quality,The picture quality was not good at all. I found myself straining my eyes while trying to watch it. About 15 minutes into the movie I just gave up trying to watch it and ended up shutting it off. I will definitely will not be ordering anymore dvd's from this vendor!
3,Short Version,"I love the colorized version, if only for seeing it in a different light.The problem is that they chose to restore and colorize the short 60m version instead of the full 87 min version which has been available for quite a while. In addition there are different versions of the shorter 60m version that are in the public domain.For the price its worth the curiosity."
1,Big rip-off,"BEWARE, DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!!! This is the made for America 60 minute version, NOT the longer 78 minute original as stated right on the case and product description here. (So much for truth in labeling!)I bought this specifically for the longer version that includes such critical scenes cut from the 60 minute version such as the two gentlemen soliciting money for charity from Scrooge in the beginning to Tiny Tim's ""God bless us, everyone"" at the Cratchet's Christmas dinner.Also, the quality was rather poor. There is a much cleaner 60 minute version that came with the Alistair Sim's 1951 double CD set.Greatly disappointed. Will never buy another product from Synergy Entertainment again!"
3,"Vintage Dickens, very dreary!","Hicks is a convincing Scrooge, but he seemed to be a lot more sympathetic in the beginning than he should have been. Cratchit, thin and frail looked the part of a starving worker trying to raise a large brood, much better than the portly Cratchit from the later Christmas Carol. The scenes were very authentic and dreary with cobwebs in Scrooges home showing he was too cheap to even spend money on nicities for himself. I didn't like the fact that Marley's ghost was heard and not seen. In all the other Christmas Carols we get to see the vision as well as hear his words to Scrooge. It's too short for my taste, so much of the story has been left out, but if one isn't familiar with the story, you won't mind."
3,Okay,"I always enjoyed watching the 1936 and 1952 versions of the Christmas Carol. When I found an earlier version, I had to watch it. Had some great parts, but overall I was disappointed. The first ghost was more a figment of his imagination. Some of the actors appeared to be stage actors and not film actors.....over dramatic. I am glad that I did watch it."
3,Seymour Hicks Christmas Carol,"The only reason to have this version of this movie is because it is so old, we can watch and reallyl appreciate what we have today in terms of quality...I love this story and I want all versions of it for my library. I watch all of them every year at Christmas ...all of us should ...it's the story of the people of today: selfish, greedy and successful in the eyes of the world."
2,Poor Quality DVD,"I received this DVD in very good time and in good, unused condition. However, the quality of the movie itself is very poor. I do not recommend purchasing this product."
1,Beware of Defective Merchandise,"I was very excited to finally find this version at a good price. However, when I received it I was very disappointed to find that the SOUND DID NOT WORK.I exchanged it for another one from the same manufacturer and the second one had the same problem.I cannot say that every print from this lot is defective but I know that two of them are.Evidently this manufacturer has produced a run of defective merchandise. BEWARE!"
2,Not Blu Ray Quality,"Though it comes with extras, they don't make it special. The quality is the same as I've seen before on DVD. It's not even close to looking like anyone cleaned and remastered it. The color version is better to watch."
3,Misleading photo of item.,"This item was returned. The photo showed a vertical display weather station, that could be hung on a wall. The item I received, however, was horizontal."
5,self help,I purchased this book for personal reasons and It was easy to read and understand. I would suggest this book for anyone who has struggles in their life
2,Religious,"I bought this book since it was quoted in another self-help book I had read and enjoyed, but this book was a little too religiously oriented for me to benefit from."
1,Product defect,"The seller stated that the book was in good condition. The book was in terrible condition, the cover was torn and when open all of the pages begin to separate and become unbound. This was the worst item that I have ever ordered on Amazon. com. The seller should be ashamed to have their name associated with the condition of this item. In short, the book should have been thrown in the trash."
4,Interesting,There are sections that are enlightening; but for the most the book has not grabbed hold of me. Worth a look.
1,Admitted sexual child abuse,A settlement has been reached in connection this Roman Catholic priest accused of sexual abuse. At least six adults claimed father John Powell abused them in the late 60's and 70's. No criminal charges were filed against Powell but the priest has admitted to the abuse.
5,This book changed my life...,"It opened me the door to the world of understanding the interpersonal communication, understanding my own feelings, desires, needs,...I read a lot of John Powell's other Books (this was my first) and they all impressed me and helped me a lot by personal growth. I found in them a lot of answers or confirmations of my feelings or thoughts, I felt I am not alone,... They helped me to see a direction when having problems in my relationships,... So i consider it for a great honor, to be able to write a review first...summary in few words: ""Thank you, John Powell!"""
5,why i am afraid to tell you who I am,"highly reccomended the author of this and other books is very thought provoking, with just the right amount of humor to help you see the light and guide you to take that fork in the road. I appreciated the book so much I am trying to find all his books to take camping with me..."
4,Good modern Aida,"This is a good modern Aida with good sound and a quality production. However, some older versions (sound only) are superior. The version with Nilsson and Corelli is my favorate."
1,Poor substitute for a real Aida,"Avoid if you can. If you want a real Aida, go for the DVD of the Covent Garden production with Studer, d'Intino, conducted by Downes. This Aida from Zurich is a minor embarrassment."
3,Just okay,I would recommend this video for someone who is just starting out or wants to maintain their weight. May be a little difficult if you have knee problems as there are a lot of bending exercises.
5,Awesome workout!,"I recommend this video to everyone who is looking to lose weight or just tone their body! Chris Freytag is amazing, motivational, and down-to-earth. She keeps you at a good pace. The workouts are awesome and effective!"
5,DVD,Instructor on this DVD easy to follow.Like the fact that each segment is only 10 minutes long.Great product for the price.
2,Couldn't get into it....,"I own a ton of workout dvd's and thought I might try this one due to the ten minute interval toning sections. I like to use these as add-ons to my cardio vids. However, I tried the entire video twice and could not get over the instructor... her chatter was really annoying and I felt like she was teaching a kindergarten class. I am not easily annoyed, and was surprised by my dislike of this dvd... I am definitely selling this one on ebay!"
4,It is an exercise tape after all...,"I like this and the other Prevention Fitness dvd. Very positive. Easy to follow. I like the 10 minute intervals.Now, I just have to find the ambition to do it regularly. Sigh."
4,not what it seems!,"A nation-wide group promises bereaved & guilt-ridden parents they will return their vanished children whose cases the police have given up on.Not so the parents. When they are approached by a seemingly charming & dedicated woman, they gladly accept her invitation to attend the secretive local chapter meetings where other parents are desperately hoping to retrieve their lost children.At Linda's first attendance, the woman brings in one of the lost children, & all the parents are elated, reaffirming their allegiance to the group & dedicating themselves to the training of surveillance & snatching of the people the two leaders say are child abductors.Linda isn't so sure. Something is hinky about the whole setup, & her doubts will put her in danger.Rebeccasreads recommends LIES as a tightly wound tale of terror, quite well written, its pages filled with tension, passion, action & fear, & the resolution is swift & riveting."
2,"Not that ""Easy.""","Anyone who is busy and doesn't have much time to decorate may not find this book's suggestions easy to accomplish. After checking it out as a possible Xmas present,I feel it is too flimsy to give as a gift."
3,This is a handy decorating tool.,"This book has some valuable but simple information for decorating your home. Some of it may have been a little too simplistic, but definitely a worthwhile read."
1,"Been there, done that","The book is filled with many little tips, but the trouble is I've read them all before in other books, decorating magazines, etc. It's a collection of cliches, but I suppose it sells because it's worth the $10 or so that amazon charges for it."
3,Paint Chapter Helpful,"I've spent many an hour looking at paint chips hoping that I will be happy with the results which stems from my lack of confidence and the overwhelming selection available at the store. This book gives you some tried and true paint choices -- I enjoyed this section very much. I only wished they had fleshed the chapter out much further to give more suggestions on taupe and sienna colors as well and a few more common interior colors beyond what was offered. Their suggestions for white and the underlying color tones in whites and molding and ceiling tricks to make it all harmonize together are very good. Other chapters had some thoughtful information in it as well. This book does not replace a good design book, more it is to spark some ideas and other tidbits that perhaps you hadn't thought about before. I think it was worth my money solely on the paint chapter."
3,paint colors dated,"I was really excited to read the section on paint colors. However, Benjamin Moore and fuller O'brien have changed their color palates and do not have these colors any more. If anyone knows how I can get or mix Fuller O'brien's Beauty C-23, please let me know."
1,A slim book with a mishmash of ideas&#65533;and no photos,A decorating book without photos is like trying to get the flavor of foods only by reading a menu. Something is definitely missing. A disappointing purchase.
2,From the Simple to the Silly,"This book is a list of bullet points with specific decorating ideas from the simple (weave artificial ivy through the security bars on your windows) to the impractical (have your lampshades custom lined with gold or pink silk for a flattering light). If some of the ideas appeal to you, you may find the book worthwhile. If not, you won't find any general decorating theories to help you design own space. (And by the way -- if you can afford custom-lined lampshades, skip the book and hire a decorator.)"
5,Interesting,"For an introduction to Media politics Graber provides the perfect setting. She exposes various theories to Media's influence on Americans. In fact, I recommend anyone going into campaign work to give this book a brief scan; it's an easy read."
1,This Isn't Even DJ Screw,Only A Few Of The Track's On This Cd Were Done By DJ Screw The Rest Of The Cd And Even The Track's DJ Screw Mixed Were Chopped By DJ Nasty Don't Bother With This CD !!
4,Pas le meilleur...,"Mais en mme temps, je ne peux cracher sur cet album. Je reste critique mais je ne peux dire que je n'aime pas cet album. Mais disons que mon amour pour les Surfers ne sort plus grand à l'écoute de cet album. Beaucoup de répétitions et peu d'inventivité comparé à d'autres albums pas mal plus tordus. Remarquez qu'on était peut-tre trop gaté avec leurs précédents albums non? :))"
3,addendum,"For those of you who may not notice while evaluating the tracks, *all* of the ""single part"" songs are covers (real covers, not just borrowed riffs). One with a medium difficulty rating is Something, and here's a hint: not just the Beatles, but Scottish brothers (not the Proclaimers). It's worth a few bucks just for the brain-teasers."
3,A sweet little book,"Though not entirely scripturally acurate, this is a nice little book. Read Matthew, Mark, Luke and John first so that you can catch the errors in Dickens story before you read it to your children."
4,Good Book,"Thanks for the speedy service. Got the book in record time!The only disappointment was that even though I knew the book would be used, I didn't know it would have an inscription inside the cover. I won't be able to give this as a Christmas gift."
2,A dull affair,"This isn't really a very good recording. Levine's treatment of the music is episodic and, at times, rather lifeless, and he fails to portray both the turmoil on the physical and psychological level.Morris's voice is drier than usual and his Dutchman cannot be said to be one of his best achievements. Voigt sings beautifully but sounds underpowered as Senta. Above all, she completely misses the passion of the character. Heppner's Eric, by contrast, is one of the best on record.As there are better recorded versions around, this set is by no means an essential buy."
2,Levine's sinking Dutchman...,"This recording is a major disappointment. The singers are so wonderfully cast that I would have loved to see what they could have done with a reading of the score that wasn't so sluggish. And I know, I know. That's what EVERYONE has been saying about Levine in this recording. But I still gave it a listen hoping that maybe these reviewers were exaggerating, or nitpicking. Unfortunately they were absolutely correct. Under Levine any momentum the orchestra and the singers build just...DIES. I found my mind wandering waiting for passages to start, waiting for a singer to spit out their lines already. It's just a complete drag.I don't want to be completely unfair. The sound is clear, the orchestra has power, the leads can definitely sing. In the end however, this doesn't even crack the top 5 Dutchman stereo recordings: the Dohnányi, Klemperer, Doráti, Solti and Sinopoli sets are all superior. At least check out a few of those recordings before settling on this one."
2,"Orchestra is fine, but . . .","The Metropolitan Opera Orchestra gives out a spectacular performance, creating enormous power and precision. And that's probably the only thing that's good about this Flying Dutchman. James Levine's tempi are dragged (most notably the ""Overture"" and the ""Spinning Chorus""), making this the least Wagnerian of all studio recordings. The choir is surprisingly unpleasant: their diction isn't good enough and their pitch isn't completely correct. The vocal soloists . . . well, let's just say that even Daniel Barenboim's choice of casting is better than this. As for the sound quality, it's just plain awful: The volume is a bit weak and the bass sound is heard incorrectly.All in all, if you want to get this ONLY for the orchestral sound, then do it. Otherwise, go for the Solti, Sinopoli, or Klemperer recordings."
4,My son loves it!,"My 18 month old son loves the Winnie the Pooh stories and characters. His favourite is, of course, Tigger, and this new addition to his library is much loved. The text is large and quite basic - just explaining on one page, for example, that Tigger climbs a tree, and on the next page, that he can't climb back down again (uh oh!) which means it's a fast moving read. It's great that it's in the shape of Tigger, too. I believe there's also a Pooh Bear shaped one in the series, that I might purchase next time."
3,Don't add to love and logic library,"If you are new to Love and Logic, this is a great book. If you are not, then all of the ""techniques"" are redundant; however, I loved all of the information that basically describes how this disease of entitlement came about in the first place (but I think you'd probably get more in depth information from Dawn Billings book Entitled to Fail, Endowed to Succeed, which is quoted heavily in this book."
4,A good pep talk,"Another great book from the Love and Logic people. Much of this book is about identifying how poor parenting and our self absorbed culture can mix to create kids with a sense of entitlement that can eat a child alive. I felt that this was largely a rehash of previous love and logic books, yet directed on one particular area where good parenting can make a huge difference. If parents could see this entitlement tragedy coming, they may be able to work against it. I love the scripted responses to typical kid attacks. Sometimes I need someone to tell me what to say and to remain calm. It's not easy. All my kids are teens now and suffer from different degrees of entitlement. Not too long, full of stories and examples."
5,Government leaders please read,"Too many people expect too much given to them without working for it. They want a ""hand out"" rather than a ""hand up."" I believe that most people in this country can give back in their own way to make this country a better place. They will have self respect and pride rather than feeling self pity. We need to foster this attitude from small children up and this book does a great job showing this."
3,"More and introduction to "" Parenting with Love and Logic""","This book was a quick read about children today, who have developed an ""entitlement"" attitude about almosteverything in their lives. Its a good introduction for people who want to learn more about ""Parenting with Love and Logic""."
2,Good Wife Bess,"""My Just Desire,"" a superficial look at the life of an Elizabethan gentlewoman, leaves much to be desired. Peppering her writing with modern phraseology, such as ""boy toy,"" author Anna Beer's diminishes both her subject and her readers' interest in it.Better that the fascinating life of Bess Throckmorton, wife to Sir Walter Ralegh, had been treated in a more reverant and scholarly manner. This is a choice subject poorly limned."
4,I was there!,"It's been a while since I last read this book, but I was in Jr high at Mickle middle school in Lincoln. It was less than ten years that the events took place if I recall right. It seemed like all north side schools had us reading this book.Bottom line, it was so close to home, it has remained in my head and every time I see reports on drugs and kids, I can't help but to be reminded of this story. When I was younger I thought it was all [...], but now I see what it's all about.You can't ""just say no"" but if your kids read, then you need to have this book for your kids."
4,Deighton's detail and panache carry his plot,I liked this book but I think the plot was a bit hard to accept at points. I very much enjoy Deighton's authorial voice for his nameless protagonist and this made it quite enjoyable for me. I find his writing style very appealing. But the plot of this particular story wasn't entirely convincing.
3,Definite product of its time (and showing its age),"While written in 1967 and first read then, I found myself re-reading this book on vacation in 2011 and being pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable it still was.While a lifelong Len Deighton fan, one has to accept this story of international espionage and sex clinics used for political ends located in Paris now definitely shows its age in parts. The use of passports to move between EU countries and worries over national security, pirate radio ships located outside the 3 mile zone, and some dialogue that could only reflect the heady socialism beliefs of the late 1960s all date the book.However the basic story line is still classic Deighton, with the inevitable nameless lead UK agent seen from prior novels, a cast of international characters who fit easily alongside the many acidic lines of dialogue and cynical observations plus a plot of many twists and turns that keeps you guessing all the way.Not his best but still a pleasure to re-read."
4,Good Pre-teen Reading,"Reminiscent of the Hardy Boys books in feel and style. The reading level is suitable for pre-teens. The story was entertaining and should prove interesting to young boys (it has it all - a ghost, old house to explore, pirates and a dog, what more could you ask).The historical elements provide a moderate overview of pirate life along the American coast in the early eighteenth century and seem fairly accurate without introducing some of the more unsavory elements of pirate reality. The historical figures involved, Edward Teach (Blackbeard) and Isreal Hands, are fairly true to life; Blackbeard may even be more realistic than the demonic depiction in Captain Charles Johnson's A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pirates.Included in the book are various elements like a short biography of Edward Teach, a guide to ship's rigging, and a timeline. I would not hesitate to recommend this book to children with an interest in pirates.P-)"
3,Not As Good As The First Album,"""Don't Look Back"" came out two years after the first one and although it maintains all of the familiar elements that made the first album so good, it does not measure up to said album. I am not sure what it is, since in many ways ""Don't Look Back"" is very similar to the first one, but it just is not as good. The title track got tons of airplay back in the day (and still gets a lot on classic rock stations today), and is a cool tune. ""A Man I'll Never Be"" is another really strong ballad full of buildup and bombast, but the rest of the album somewhat leaves me cold. The songs are not bad, they just aren't great either. The music is mostly a re-hash of things done before, and the lyrics are very, very average 70's rock n roll good time party stuff. The album is also a bit on the short side, even for 70's vinyl standards. All in all ""Don't Look Back"" is a bit of a letdown from the band's debut, but probably better than everything that came after it."
4,Boston's second album,"Boston's second album Don't Look Back isn't as good as the first album, but is still good. The title track is a classic as well as Feelin' Satisfied, and A Man I'll Never Be. I'll just say if you liked the first album you'll enjoy this one their both pretty simuliar in sound."
5,A TIMELESS and DEFINITIVE classic rock MASTERPIECE!,"To say 'Boston' was unique, influential, and ahead of their time, is an understatement. Case in point- after I graduated high school around the time 'Dont Look Back' came out, my best friend and I decided to take our 'dream trip' to Europe for 6 weeks, where we backpacked the continent on foot by day, and slept on trains and ferry boats during the nights. Almost everywhere we went... clubs, pubs, beaches, brothels (LOL!), music stores, outdoor wine fairs, the inside of taxis, etc. ... we heard the first 2 Boston albums being played in so many cases! In Greece, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, etc.! It was uncanny, really, we thought. 'Boston' was such a popular rock band, and not only in America. Their 'reach' was worldwide within a few short months! How many bands can claim this?R.I.P. Brad Delp, and THANK YOU for some of the best, heartfelt, good time rock EVER!!!"
5,Another 70's Adult Oriented Rock classic,Great songs - Boston were consistently good. Easily enjoyed by the masses. See my review for the original Boston album -- all the same comments apply here!
4,Felt satisfied. Definite road trip CD.,"I first heard it while in grade school, and I liked it. Today, well, I still like it. Boston is just one of those bands that you never get tired of no matter what they churn out over the years. It is not the greatest album, but if you compare Boston's stuff to 90's music in general, this album starts to sound really good!"
3,Decent and listenable.,"Don't Look Back is on the same level as Boston's debut album. Both of them are listenable, but not classics. Just like on their first album, the first track on here is the best of the bunch and the rest of the tunes are mostly just okay. That aside, the musicianship displayed on Don't Look Back is tight and professional. The production is cool and crisp also. ""Don't Look Back"" is a good song, but I don't think that it matches up to ""More than a Feeling."" This album sounds basically like the first album. It isn't a favorite of mine, but it still has some decent energy and songs. Worth a listen."
1,Snooze away,"Boston's 2nd album is pretty much interchangable with their first aside from the absence of ""More Than A Feeling."" If you have the first album, you don't need this one."
1,Never Forgive,"As much as I really hate to admit it, I like the song ""More Than A Feeling."" It is just too bad that it, this band, and their inexplicably massively popular debut album, helped user in the ever dreaded arena rock craze of the late 70's and early 80's. Horrid bands like Journey, Styx, REO Speedwagon, etc. owe their careers to this band, and for that they should NEVER be forgiven."
4,Boston Party,"Don't Look Back was the follow up to what was at the time the biggest selling debut album in history. Boston's self titled debut was filled with arena rock anthems that featured a wall of guitars that inspired air guitarists everywhere. Don't Look Back follows that winning formula. The album doesn't contain the number of classics that the debut does, but it still pretty darn good. The title track is barrage of guitars that contains an explosive vocal from Brad Delp. ""The Journey"" shows off Tom Scholz's studio wizardry. ""A Man I'll Never Be"" finds the band treading into ballad territory to good results. ""Feelin' Satisfied"" is a burner while ""Party"" is just that a party of guitars. If you like guitars and lots of them, then this album will be to your liking. Alot of people liked this album as it became the band's first number one album in late 1978."
3,A Hard Follow Up,"Boston's debut album, Boston, was sensational. More Than A Feeling was their follow up and while a strong album in itself it let down some expectations, even if this was unfair. This album does sport some strong tracks with More Than A Feeling fitting right in with the previous album's tracks. But from there, it went a bit downhill. I still give this project 3 stars, which I rate as good because it is good and is measured against one of the best recordings in 1970's rock. If this would have been a debut album it would have rated far higher.For someone who liked the first album this will be enjoyable too, only not quite as consistent. But still worth the price."
2,TOO MUCH OF THE SAME,"Boston's 2 cd was too much like their first cd. Sound and music wise. Other than the title track, Party, Feelin Satisfied, and A Man I'll Never Be, the songs sound second rate rejects from the first cd. BIG let down from the first one. This cd would have gotten a higher score maybe if it had been done before the first cd, but it wasn't."
2,Sophomore jinx,"Boston guitarist Tom Shultz attempted to avoid the sophomore jinx by following up his band's classic debut album with another set of similar sounding material. Unfortunately, he used up most of his best ideas the first time around. Though the title track of ""Don't Look Back,"" and perhaps ""Feelin' Satisfied"" are up to the first album's standards, the rest suffer from a fatiguing similarity and show that the Boston arena rock formula was already beginning to wear thin. Shultz must have sensed this, because he fired the rest of the band (except for lead singer Brad Delp) and went into seclusion for over seven years before reappearing with his next effort. By then of course, time had passed him and his band by."
4,It's not fair to compare it to the first album,Coming out with something as good as their first album was all but impossible. But their 2nd is still good on it's own.
4,The title song made this album,"Don't Look Back is my all time favorite Boston single, but the depth of the first album overshadows the album ""Don't Look Back."" I did enjoy ""A Man I'll Never Be"" as well. Though I didn't give this CD five stars, it is still an essential component in anyone's 70's rock collection."
5,Remember....,"OK. Raise your hand if you bought this on 8-track when it first came out. Remember how the music faded out near the beginning of ""It's Easy""..... (click,clunk) ....and then faded back in on channel two!I imagine everyone who's wincing from this brutal (and totally uncalled for) lurch back to August, 1978 already has this on CD.So for anyone who's wading into Boston for the first time, let me say: there are no bad songs on this album! It's short (a mere 33:42). It's famous for Tom Scholz declaring that he released it before he was finished (under pressure from Epic Records). But there's nothing lacking about the tunes, the playing or production. It's pure Boston and every bit as great as the first album!"
4,great followup to their debut masterpiece,"Boston's 2nd album, Don't Look Back, doesn't surpass the brilliance of their first self-titled album, but it's still essential listening. Don't Look Back is very similar in style and feel to the first Boston album. The original band lineup only made these two albums and they are both classics."
5,guiter ! before synthesizer...,"when i was 17 years old,i listened this music and i was shocked and amazing.Tom is the most greatest guitarist more than synthesizer machine.at always...."
4,Popular concensus is wrong: This album contains some of Boston's best,"Popular opinion is that this is the weak followup to Boston's classic debut album. The truth is that half of this album represents Boston's BEST work of all time, while the other half is filler. The first half of this album is terrific, from the opening chords of the title track to ""Man I'll Never Be"", this is ace stuff. The trouble lies entirely on side two, which is generally sub-mediocre. The hidden treat on this side is ""Used to Bad News"", which is a great sonic pop bon-bon. Tom Scholz' record label rushed him to release the record, and it's painfully obvious on the remainder of the second ""side"" (second half for you CD fans). Nonetheless, the good stuff is so good, I'm inclined to give the whole album 4 stars. Make your own compilation by jettisoning the remainder of side two and adding most of the first LP, and you have one for the guitar gods' time capsule.dap"
2,Ooof.,"Probably should be 2 and a half stars. Pretty much more of the same as the debut but not nearly as interesting, except for the title track and A Man I'll Never Be, both of what are excellent tracks. The thing I noticed is that Boston album sides got progressively worse on the first two albums. Boston Side 1 was truly exceptional, Side 2 was very, very good. Boston's Don't Look Back Side 1 was good, and Side 2 was, well, it was there."
3,A rushed follow up to the debut album,"To me, Boston falls into the One Hit Wonder category, only in their case, their ""one hit"" was their entire first album, released on Epic Records in 1976. That album has gone platinum an incredible seventeen times, and all of the songs on it were staples of radio back in the day. Don't Look Back on the other hand, was less than half as popular as its predecessor, and it is easy to see why: it simply was not as good as the first album! In 1978, the fat, balding, cigar smoking record company executives in suits and ties had grown very impatient with Tom Scholz's meticulous production style, and kept pressuring him to get the album out so they could add some more millions to their bank accounts. As a result, some of the songs sound rushed and not quite finished. No wonder Boston's record sales have been so sluggish from 1978 onwards. The music industry was just too greedy and demanding for Tom to produce his music the way he saw fit."
2,Dont look at all,"This album is a carbon copy of the first. With the exception of the title track, this CD is for die hard Boston fans only. Everyone else can do without it."
4,a constellation guidebook,".... Primarily a constellation guidebook. Charts by Wil Tirion. Charts are mag 6, scale is 27mm per 10 degrees and each chart covers an area 4 hr RA by 45 Dec. A fair amount of sky surrounding each constellation chart helps with orientation. Has 100 pages of science, how to, equipment and data tables including nearest stars and brightest stars. Lots of good science with excellent visuals. All sky maps for every month. Several notable objects described in each constellation provide a wide variety, however many would not be found with a moderate telescope. Good charts, but could label more stars and plot more objects. Moon maps and a limited section on the planets. Excellent bibliography and list of resources. Overall a good choice as a constellation guidebook and astro science book."
4,Fantastic guide! Very helpful for the beginning astronomer.,I received this book with my first telescope. It has a section in it with sky charts that are easy to use. I strongly recommed it for novices.
5,A moving story read as a child and never forgotten.,"I have been searching for the book ""Space Cat Meets Mars"" for decades. If ""Space Cat"" is the same book, I read it in the 1960's when in elementary school, and renewed it as many times as the library would allow. As the years passed, I never forgot what an incredible impact this story had on me as a child. Now after more than 30 years, I don't recall precisely the story line or details, yet I do recall the book as part of a fond childhood memory."
5,"Forty-five years later,","I still remember these books! Incredible.When our cat had kittens, we named the black and white one Flyball!When I was in my twenties I went to the library and reread them again, and let my kids read them.So glad they are available again!Space Cat!"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"These hoses are absolute crap! I wouldn't even give this product 1 star! I made the mistake of buying 5 of these a few months ago. None of them actually sprinkle no matter what side of the hose is facing upwards, they just barely drip. And then the second time I used them 3 of them developed big holes through the side of the hose in several places! They are unusable now since they don't take a repair very well, they just develop more holes further down. Save your money and buy the more expensive ones - at least you'll have a useable hose!"
1,Worst garden hose ever,"I should have read the existing reviews before purchasing. Indeed, the watering pattern is so uneven that it is unfit for gardening. If your garden depends on water during dry times, 2/3 of your garden will die because only a few oversize holes in this hose will spurt water. Go with a Gilmour hose instead. The Swan hose is so bad, it should be pulled from the market."
5,Excellent continuation of the first volume,"This continuation of Yong Ho's ""Beginning Chinese"" follows a slightly different format, First of all, it does not have the cultural insight digressions that made the first volume so enjoyable (however the useful ""Language Points"" are still there). Secondly the structure of the chapters are different; this volume has reading and translation exercises that the first volume didnt have (not a surprising development as one progresses in learning the language). Thirdly the quality and organization of the CD is much improved over the CDs found in ""Beginning Chinese."" The book concludes with a guide on internet resources and computing in Chinese that is very helpful. As is the case for Ho's ""Beginning Chinese"" and his ""Chinese-English Frequecy Dictionary"" you'll get some grammatical insights to Mandarin that are difficult to find elsewhere."
2,Disappointing,"I am sure that the author was well-intentioned, but according to my Chinese friends who are on the Mainland, there are numerous errors in the cultural information sections. Also, some of the phrases and usages listed in this book are very uncommon, some were described to me as being flat-out incorrect. I do not know how much of that is publisher/editor error, but the end result is the same.This is unfortunate, because it could have been an excellent resource, but it does not reflect the language as it is spoken today by educated native speakers in Beijing, Shanghai, or Guangzhou (I have friends in all three cities)."
2,Live at Montreux 1994,This recording is awful. Would not recommend this to anyone. Not sure why Paul Rodgers would even let this one out.
4,"Good perfromance ... but not as good as the ""Glasgow"" DVD.","For any Bad Co. / Paul Rodgers fan this should be purchased ... the performance and musicianship is 1st rate, but not quite in the same league as the ""Live in Glasgow"" show ... as with all of his shows, you get superb, straight ahead hard rock ..."
5,RUCKMAN IS RIGHT-ON!!!,"In spite of the girly-men who can't take the solid truth so they brand someone ""a fundamentalist"" (which means someone who believes God's perfect Word), Dr. Ruckman is right on!!!Seeing that about 80% of bulidings today with a sign on it that says ""church"" don't have a clue, don't believe the Bible, accept corrupted phony-baloney modern ""translations"", and believe in bringing in the Kingdom without the King (NCCC and so on) who walk step in step with the country's first Muslim President.It is an honor to be called ""fundamentalist"" by these fake, phony, world peace, Israel hating, Satanists.Mark O'Neill"
1,The man who killed Fundamentalism,"Peter Ruckman is to be commended: before him, Fundamentalism was a shadowy variant of the mainstream Evangelical movement. It took Evangelicalism's emphases to embarassing extremes, inviting scorn and criticism on ALL born-again Christians.But Ruckman's King James Only movement took Fundamentalism outside of the Christian Church. Now, independent Baptists are more likely to be raving heretics rather than misguided Christians. Evangelicals no longer need to bear patiently with Fundamentalists. We no longer need to do damage control. Today's Fundamentalists are not orthodox Christians. We're finally free of them.Thank you, Dr. Ruckman."
5,It really IS good on everything,"I bought some of this after seeing it featured on Food Finds. At first I thought it would be a good alternative to cranberry sauce at Thanksgiving but it's even better than that. It's not tart like regular cranberry.....even with all the different tart fruits in the ingredients, it's surprisingly smooth and surprisingly good. I've tried it on ice cream, with cheese and crackers and have even put it on barbequed pork. So far, it's been fabulous on everything. I just keep trying to find more things to try it on! Will definitely be buying this one again!"
2,Disappointing,"Saw the product on television years ago when it first hit the market. Finally, got around to purchasing it. I expected a thick, naturally delicious fruit mixture, with predominantly cranberry and cherry flavor. In my experience, it was very reminiscent of cooked prunes and raisins. Way too much money for the product, in my opinion. Sorry."
3,The Human Figure,This book has some interesting poses and there were an equal number of male and female photos but that's about where the praise ends. This would be a better book for reference had there been a variety of different models. Another problem is the fact that the male model is wearing something that interferes with the lines of his body. This book is also somewhat difficult to use because of the layout. With every turn of the page some of the pictures are upside down and some are rightside up and some are sideways. So you are constantly flipping the book around to view the photos. There are other better reference books available.
4,A good reference,This is not a new book and I have had it for many years. While I don't think there is enough variety (in models and positions) to make it a great book I have found it to be a useful reference quite a number of times. I do wish that the lighting had been stronger to give sharper shading in general for muscle definition.It doesn't have the variety or sheer number of options available in the *pose file* series but quite a few pictures are fairly large in this book which is very nice. If you do find a shot that works for you than this is a very nice book to have.I think this would be a good adjunt book if you already own several. I wouldn't make this your only figure book or your first one...unless you happen on it and find a figure in here that you wish to draw. this book isn't an instuction book on how to draw as much as it is a nude figure reference.
3,The Human Figure Erik A. Ruby,I would have liked to see more variety in the figure models and poses that were more artistic.
2,Better free online.,"If you don't mind looking through the trashy online sites you get more poses of various types from different angles without impeding clothing on xxx sites. It just takes a while to find some good nude photo rather than porn sites, but once you find one with good links to others your set. Sorry but Artist friends of mine have this book and its only advantage is it's conviently in front of you and not on screen. I recommend not getting it, get a printer and find some tasteful online nude photo sites. The only other advantage this book has is that anyone seeing it on your coffee table or studio will not find such PC and unaturual poses offensive, but I suspect this would not be a concern for artists that need nude references for their work."
5,Biblical scholar resource,The Dake Annotated Reference Bible is simply the best biblical scholar resource that I've ever come across. I was pleasantly surprised to have received exactly what I've ordered - delivered on time.
5,The most thorough study Bible by far,"Though, as an Independent Baptist, I don't agree with Dake's conclusions every time, this is a masterful work, truly comprehensive beyond any other study Bible I've had, and I've had quite a few. The study helps alone would fill multiple regular volumes, yet they are at your fingertips right in your Bible. It also comes in large print.The only disadvantage I saw was very little space for notes (all the space is filled up with study helps) and maybe the concordance could be a little more complete for a work this extensive."
5,Lots to digest,"As I rated this I was thinking of when I first opened it and saw all the work Finis put in to this work. I thought that I would use it at first for my daily reading but once I started I changed my mind. What usually takes me 10 to 15 min. in the morning to read and the same in the evening turned in to and hour and a half. I figure it was because of all the interesting footnotes which I call ""rabbit trails"". I do indeed love it."
1,The Product,"I got the bible for myself, when I finaly opened the bible to start reading it, I noticed that in the middle of the book, pages were toren like they had gotten caught in the printing of the book. I could not return it becuase I did not keep the packaging and it was opened. Next time I will pay the extra money and purchase my books from the actual books store. Lesson Learned."
3,a happy disappointment,"I had forgotten how many great songs PH had done! Wow, 3 of them! I am glad to have the disc, but, if I play it again, it will likely be just the last 3-4 songs :("
5,The definitive Goldwater,"Goldberg's biography is the definitive work on Mr. Conservative, Barry Goldwater. Essential reading for anyone interested in Goldwater and an excellent reminder that Goldwater's brand of conservatism is a far cry from the conservatism of the religious right. The book is a balanced view of the man from Arizona written by a scholar with an engaging and highly readable writing style."
3,Okay,Recieved the shoes today...I was disapointed with the buckle--it is leather and incorporated in the design. I was hoping for plastic or tortis shell. Do not know if they are keepers...hmmmm
5,maxwell is one of the sexiest hottest r&b singers .,"maxwell is one of the hottest r&b singers in the music industry.he is laid back,mellow,sensitive,and last but not least good lookin!"
5,COOL !!!!,"This is an incredible cd it is very nice this is Maxwell's debut album and it is great and it is wonderful composed and arranged the editing and vocals are wonderful . Maxwell has a nice voice he sings very well I enjoy this album he has a lot of nice songs on this album and I truly enjoy it and I would recommend anyone who likes Maxwell to purchase this album. My favorite songs on this album are: When The Cops Come Knocking, Ascension, Sumethin Sumethin, and many others so therefore buy this album if you like neo-soul!!!!"
4,Not Really My Style But,"I truly think that Maxell is a very talented singer but still it's really not my style in buying his records. This is an album with a lot of power in voice and production, it's hard not to give it a 5 star review. The beats are very smooth and can set a nice mood especially a chill one. The only problem is you shouldn't play it a lot cause this guy is liable to take your girl from you. I do feel that one or two of these tracks should have been cut because they seem lower in value and unneeded but overall it's still a nice album."
4,Urban Hang Suite,CD arrived in great condition and on time. No complaints here...and the price was right.
4,Wow!!,"Hey, I just found my CD by Maxwell and have not heard/played it in years...and all I can say is, ""WOW""!! It is still good! and my favorite is still ""Til the Cops Come Knocking""...WOW!"
5,OUTSTANDING!,"I totally agree with the remarks of a previous reviewer who likened this production to those of the earlier works of PRINCE. It smacks hard of 'For You' and the 'Prince' album which, by the way are the most underrated albums, I believe, of all time. Maxwell has taken off like a ricochet rabbit and Embrya is just as tight. Suggestion: when listening to Maxwell's stuff, do it with someone you love and try not to take your clothes off right away. Knowhutimsayin sugababe!?"
5,WORDS CAN NOT EXPRESS!,"MAXWELL IS THE GREATEST. I PURCHASED THIS CD AFTER WATCHING THE VIDEO FOR THE SONG ...TIL THE COPS COME KNOCKING. I LISTENED TO THIS CD EVERYDAY AND ONLY A FEW OTHERS HAD HEARD OF HIM. THE SONGS, ASCENSION, LONELY'S THE ONLY COMPANY, REUNION AND SUITELADY ARE MY FAVORITES ON THIS CD. MAXWELL IS IN MY TOP THREE MALE ARTISTS. I SAW HIM IN CONCERT IN AUGUST OF 1999 AND I MUST SAY THAT WAS THE BEST CONCERT I'VE BEEN TO SINCE THE LATE 1980'S WHEN I SAW LUTHER VANDROSS IN CONCERT. I LOVE YOU MAXWELL, YOUR FAN FOR LIFE."
4,........a must,"I never get tired of this disc. Great funk, smooth vocals, and never boring. If your reading this and you don't buy it, your making a big mistake."
4,So Smooth,"I have owned this cd for years. I never get tired of listening to it. This is my favorite Maxwell CD. My favorite song on the cd has to be Lonelys the only company. mmmmm,so smooth."
5,Smoooooth Groooooves....,There is so much smooth soul on this CD ....I can't stand it....no CD collection is complete without it.
3,Just the Beginning,"Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite is for the grownups. Smooth music to get your grove on, experience band that hangs on his every verse. I love it, I had to come back and add this to my collection after getting his latest cd Black Summer Nights."
5,one of the best albums ever,"I still remember the first time I listened to Maxwell. Here in Greece and especially in 90s there was only one show in the radio that was playing r'n'b and soul music. And I still remember when I bought the cd. God, his voice is like velvet or silk. soft and powerfull in the same time. And the songs. I like all the songs but I have to admit that I ADORE ""till the cops come knockin"" and ""Sumthin' Sumthin"".I strongly believe that is one of the best debut album ever along with D'Angelo's of course. (oh how I miss him!)(I apologize for my poor english)"
5,umph umph umph what a man!!!!!,"Anything Maxwell is off the chain!!! Can't wait for his latest CD. By the way, wonder what's takin so long?"
1,Outdated glamour,"This book would have been a nice try about 25 years ago. Now it is outdated and oldfashioned. The genre has developed rapidly, and the 'glamour' of the 80's is not so glamorous any more. The pictures look aged, and, then, we have the digital world nowadays - just an information for the writer ;)"
3,Good information... bad image examples!,Great information but at the price of some really bad images really keep this book from being a definitive source.
5,Pretty Badass,"My main fascination with photography recently has been lighting, so before reading this book I decided to read ""Lighting for Glamour Photography"". I almost wish I had read this one first since it covers glamour lighting in great detail, plus a whole lot of other stuff.I just finished reading it today, so it's still sinking in, but if you plan on taking beautiful pictures of women and taking it seriously, you pretty much have to read this book. It's a career's worth of experience in an easy to read book.I've got to say though that some of the 80's style pictures are pretty laughable, especially the 80's sunglasses! Ironically, the author mentions how ludicrous things like sunglasses look when they go out of style!"
1,"Canned , boring and not glamourous","First, the look inside on this website is not what is in this book,but of another edition. The photos are so simplistic and boring............................................................... Glamour?.. Def. of Glamour: An air of compelling charm, romance, and excitement, especially when delusively alluring. ........ This book has 95% nude women, many with their legs spread open, or breasts and crotch as the focul point. Photos a15 year old boy would take and like or for men who see only this aspect of women.The photos are of poor quality--primarily nude women done like simple snapshots of your wife with an adequate camera. If the women were clothed you would not think much of these photos. Not artistic or glamourous at all. The technical information is weak. A bunch of photos of breasts, butts and open crotch shots."
2,Dribbles and does not whistle!,"I purchased teakettle because it was large and matched my kitchen appliances. It does look nice but it does not function well. I will be purchasing another to take its place as soon as I find another large, white kettle. Pretty disappointed."
1,Future IHOP Waitresses,These little girls have no talent. Don't bother with this CD- you might as well just throw your money in a ditch.
3,Cheesy,"There are a couple of nice songs on this, but most of the numbers are played on one of those roller rink type organs. Reminds me of ""what if Santa ran a funeral home?""."
1,Rotten!,"Possibly the worst movie ever made? John Wayne must have been desperate for something when he took this part! Don't get me wrong, I LOVE John Wayne, but really, this movie is the pits. He wasn't cut out to be a Mongol. It's interesting to watch just to see how bad a movie can get! It's so extremely dumb!"
1,John Wayne's worst movie!,Total miscasting of John Wayne as Kahn. It's laughable with the makeup trying to make him look Asian.
2,A Silly Movie,"I thought this was a silly movie. John Wayne was hopelessly miscast. It is historically laughable. Susan Hayward's part is absurd. The ending was absurd. All of this said, it was a passable entertainment that was in other ways well directed & still somewhat enjoyable. The script if silly was well constructed."
3,laughable,"John Wayne`s performance in this film is laughable, watch it in much the same way you would an Ed Wood movie. A good actor becomes the character he`s playing. John Wayne always makes the character he`s playing John Wayne."
2,Movie Trivia,"Once you stop laughing at the idea of the ""Duke"" playing Genghis Khan with that same western drawl, consider this: almost everyone who worked on this film died of cancer because the movie was made on location in the desert where there had been testing of the a-bomb."
1,"A BOMB, figuratively and literally!","The well-documented fact that the principal actors in this film eventually died of cancer affirms that this one was doomed from the start. Accepting Wayne and Hayward as Asians is more unbelievable as blue-eyed Burt Lancaster as ""Geronimo"".While ""The Conqueror"" does sport high production values, the absurdity of the casting makes it one of the looniest decisions ever to come from a major Hollywood studio.Ed Wood would've done better!"
2,A bizarre casting of John Wayne,"I have always been a John Wayne fan, but I had never even heard of this movie till I saw it on the shelf at Blockbuster early in 1999. I couldn't believe my eyes. Since Genghis Khan is my favorite historical personage, I couldn't resist the combination. I have to agree, however, that it was a fairly silly role for Wayne. On the plus side, he actually looked somewhat Mongol. What really didn't fit was Susan Hayward as Bortai, the most obviously white person there. She absolutely did not fit and, I believe, did not even come close to a proper portrayal of Bortai. She was clearly the worst item. It was also bad when the Khan's horsemen attacked the Tartars near the end. There was none of the disciplined army in evidence. They looked like an unruly mob. Very disappointing."
3,Advice For the Cost Conscious,"If you really want this (in)famous epic, you can do a lot better than this Universal Vault Series by acquiring the Universal DVD set of ""John Wayne: An American Icon Collection,"" which was released a few years ago, but which is still available for about $12 right here on Amazon. For this price, you get a nice Anamorphic CinemaScope print of ""The Conqueror"", plus ""Pittsburgh"" (B&W), ""Seven Sinners"" (B&W), ""The Shepherd of the Hills"" (in 3-strip Technicolor), and the other loopy Howard Hughes epic, ""Jet Pilot"" (with Janet Leigh playing an escaped Russian jet pilot wearing the tighest fitting sweater this side of Anita Ekberg). You should hurry before the set becomes extinct and falls in the hands of the price gougers."
5,Galapagos Islands,"We had just taken a Galapagos cruise on the TipTop III, that was owned by Rolf Wittmer. It was a very interesting book, that covered the history of the Galapagos."
5,creative,"the pieces are selected by great care.they develop your imagination.whether you are a beginner or an advice beader, you should have this book."
5,Inspiration on each page,"If you're looking for a how-to manual,keep looking. But if you're looking for a book with beautiful photographs of glass beads, you're in the right place. Each page contains photographs of beads by talented glass artisans. What's especially nice about this book is that there are artists represented from many different skill levels. For an intermediate glass artist like me, it's good to see that I've come a long way, but there is still so much territory to explore. The photographs in this book catalog this evolution exquisitely.It's inspirational and almost overwhelming to see so many gorgeous beads together. It will provide me with inspiration for a long time.I would recommend this book for artists and collectors alike."
5,"Amazing, inspiring examples","As a beginner in making glass beads, I am inspired by the variety and complexity of the beads shown in beautiful photos in this book. I hope I can just begin to create some beads one tenth as beautiful as some of these."
3,bit too much filibuster,"To be honest, this book reads as if it were written about me. There's about a 90% similarity in our lives. Its way to canny and surreal. What I didn't like was that it was filled with filibuster... Almost every paragraph had an explanation with a ton of examples. Ok we get it your kids have friends, did you really have to name them all. Another instance naming every quirky things your kids do or naming every favorite foods they like to eat. Ya I realized he's not a writer, he's a punk rocker, but hey was there no one that could have read it before you had it published? or even your publisher, no reaction? Anyhow Pennywise rocks and I'm also glad to know you're a NOFX fan... I've got 3 kids and 2 of them are girls and they're my little punk rockers. Don't get me wrong, I too send them to prestigious schools just so they'll turn out better than I. Hey if you ever need a replacement bass player for some stupid reason? Look me up in Reno Nv... Thanks for the laughsJohnny T..."
3,The Gratist Generation,"First there was that Mark Jacobson chrestomathy, then ""Alternadad,"" now this--what is with these people?"
5,Funny stuff! Good for reading in the evening in bed...,"Just read the first chapter, but it was quite amusing and for me especially interesting how ""Punk Rock Dad"" talks abouts his motives, why he changed into a punk, because I am ten years younger.Is quite good lecture for late evening just to sleep away..."
5,Put Your Fake Book to Work!,I have been using fake books for 30+ years and Ann Collins gives just about the best I've seen in showing new users the ropes.I have over a thousand dollars worth of fake books and despite the fact the I have been using them for so long already - Ann still gave insights that were new to me!Don't miss out - snag this book!
4,A very good debut!,"The cover blurb by Donna Andrews describes the book as ""a modern day Nick and Nora Charles,"" and I'd say she's not far off. The characters are part of the upscale, San Francisco, theatre, cocktail set, but it's the self-deprecating, first person voice that gives the story balance and humor. All of the supporting characters are wonderful, particularly Flank. It's a quick, fun read that is cozy with a bit of romance, but also an entertaining break for those of us who usually prefer something darker. I'll be looking forward to Charley and Jack's next adventure."
3,Not his best - or his worst,"eh. I recall hearing this and really liking it when it came out. On hearing it more recently, frankly it didn't hold up all that well...not that it's terrible, but certainly nothing to write home about. If you're big into Tom Scott, it's worth getting, but first opt for ""Blow Out"" or others, as this is well down the list of his albums overall.PS: I just saw what the CDs are going for ie $40-60+. Hilarious. If you pay this kind of money for this album, you will kick yourself."
5,Get your jazz sax fix with this kickin' disk !!,"Tom Scott - Street Beat was a vinyl album that I played endlessly. I was glad I finally found it on CD and nowit gets played in my car, on my laptop, and at my job. I have been a long-time fan of Tom Scott and am alwayssurprised at how little name recognition he has - even with so-called ""music lovers"". I recommend this albumto everyone and then encourage them to tell their friends, neighbors, relatives,..."
4,Commendable accomplishment,"A spirited read and praiseworthy effort to promote the historical importance of the Oregon Trail.In 1993, to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Great Migration westward, Candy Moulton, Ben Kern and Earl Leggett, with multitudes of others along the way, traveled from Independence, Missouri to Independence, Oregon in covered wagons. Although at times having access to today's modern conveniences and comforts, the undertaking no doubt was laborious, fatiguing and strenuous.Candy's writing style is creative and harmonic, bringing together quotes from overlanders' diaries and journals to emphasize the hardships and perils these pioneers had to confront.Enjoyable and insightful."
4,Great deal,"I got this DVD for Christmas and have to say that I am quite pleased with it. I have seen Macy perform live and watching this DVD was a great reminder of the show. She sounds as good live as she does on her CD's. You can always count on Macy to put on a great show. This DVD is a real value compared to some of the other DVD concerts that I have bought in the past. I gave it only four stars as opposed to five simply because of the lack of extra's. Basically the only extra on this is a slide show. I would love to see some things like back stage footage, etc... This is still a great buy to see a great live performance."
2,Don't bother,"Tired remakes of better earlier releases, made in the twilight of Dinah's career when her voice had but a fraction of its earlier power and stamina. It's painful to hear her wobble her way through a shortened soft-soap version of ""I'll close my eyes"", and to hear her impaired intonation on the high notes. My advice is, to choose from the many excellent albums out there. ""Jazz Round Midnight"" and ""Dinah Washington Sings Standards"", both by Verve are good ones, and ""The Fats Waller Songbook"" and ""Dinah!"", both by EmArcy are top notch. Any of these albums will give you a much better representation of Ms. Washington's incredible versatility, awesome expressive powers, and unmatched ability to seamlessly integrate with an instrumental group of any size or composition."
3,Dinah's Slow Jams,"This is a great collection. The songs are all pop/jazz standards recorded in 1962 and 1963. Two things I particularly like about his CD is that it includes ""A Stranger on Earth"" (later used as the title track to Lina's beautiful album) and only one song (""I'll Close My Eyes"", but a different recording) overlaps with Dinah's ""Mad About the Boy"" [Crimson, 1997] collection. Not much track information is provided; no photos of Dinah, either."
3,Entertaining,"A enjoyable read. Germond does confirm my feelings about McLaughlin, that he's obnoxious and a boor. I agree that Jack spent a little too much time in the bars and oogling the girls. (I guess when you reach a certain age this become funny instead of sleazy.) He also treated those who treated him well with more consideration. However it is an entertaining book, but as long as it was an insider's jottings it could have had more anecdotes. I don't think Mr. Germond was quite the principled person that he would have you believe him to be. He has a tendency to be too self-effacing to be true. But, I still read the book and enjoyed it."
2,Too much petty bitterness; not enough meat,"I agree with reviewer Bruce Novozinsky. If you're fascinated by Jack Germond, the person, or if you like reading gossip, then you may enjoy this book a lot. If, like me, you hoped it would provide real insight into politics and journalism from a sage Washington journalist, you'll likely be disappointed. Germond comes across like an Archie Bunker of the left, bitter, boring and repetitive."
4,Good book but...,"We enjoyed Germond's stories and insights on the political scene. However, we were sadly dismayed to read of his views regarding the abortion issue.Mr. Germond, either something is alive or not, and uninterrupted, will live or not. Aren't you at all concerned to make that judgment call? Scares us.You wrote so very well - at times one could almost hear your voice."
2,Disappointed,"When I saw the book I ate it up. I expected this book to be a page-turner and read like a who's who in DC and beyond. It left my tank on empty. Germond should be taking a reflective look at this book as an effort in ""should have been, would have been and could have been."" It missed. What I read was a reporter who spent a lot of time in hotel bars, looking ""at leggy broads"" when he could have told us about the smokey room deals and power brokers of DC. This is what I expected. It was not what was delivered. His look at the McLaughlin Group was a major axe-grinding and non-informative. ack, write one more in about 5 years and tear the blankets off American Politics."
3,Enough Anecdotes to Keep You Reading,"This book is on one level really personal. The people are described according to how Jack feels about them as human beings. Jack loved Nelson Rockefeller. Jack hated Richard Nixon. Jack was fascinated by George Wallace. Jack hasn't liked a president since Jimmy Carter. This is indeed interesting as Carter may be the smartest nicest president we have ever had, but it doesn't do much to explain why Carter was an absolute failure at the job. He had many criticisms about Reagan, Bush and Clinton, but he has little to say about the 20 years of sustained economic growth maintained by them.Jack writes that he is interested in the horse race aspect of politics mostly. Who is winning and who is losing. These stories he tells well. I particularly like his days covering the New York state house. His ""to hell with it"" style throughout is quite entertaining and the book's best asset, but I wanted more meat and less milk."
1,Review of Alaska Trees & Wildflowers,I purchased this guide and took it with me on a cruise to SE Alaska. The guide has too few species listed and too little information on each species to be of any practical use. I would not recommend it.Ron StoessellLondi Moore
1,Doesn't this disc need RE-MASTERING?!?,"I appreciate the content-based reviews, but some of us are long-time Cars fans who made their minds up about the songs many years ago. The question is, is this compact-disc everything it could be in terms of SOUND REPRODUCTION?Regrettably not. The Cars albums were initially ""dumped"" to CD back in the early 90s, and it took a long time for the first three albums to be decently re-mastered. (Sadly, ART and LYRIC reproduction still has not been handled properly! Each new CD version looks exactly like the older, worse version!) As far as I can tell, Shake It Up and Heartbeat City have never been properly transferred. In other words -- they sound terrible.Seems the problem is, Elektra's out of business. Certaintly, it's not a question of The Cars being able to sell records, since they ALWAYS DID, FROM DAY ONE. It's just not fair.Somebody, please, obtain the rights and do The Cars right! Don't these pioneers of 80s sound quality deserve modern reproduction?"
4,This is The Cars in the complete sense,"""Shake it Up"" is the perfect follow-up to ""Panorama"" and a nice prelude to ""Heartbeat City"". In a way the album is a mixture of the 2 album styles (""Since You're Gone""/""Shake It Up""/""Victim of Love""/""Think it Over"" sounding like they fell off the ""Heartbeat City"" album and the rest sounding like they could be leftovers from ""Panorama"").A very diverse album all the way with Ocasek's lyrics and Hawkes' keyboards ruling the scene. Ocasek's lyrics have never been better than they are in this album (""chicken encounters fill your bowels"" and ""is this the kill? is this the thrill? this could be love"" among many other poetic pieces).My favorites on the album are ""Cruiser"" and ""Think it Over"". Both songs are negative (ala ""Panorama"") in their approach, but say so much about Ocasek.This album is the advanced, techno, new-wave Cars that is so much their trademark - and the essential (but not their best) Cars' album in my book"
3,"Shake It Up is NOT remastered, as the first three albums were..","Wanted to confirm that this $6.99 Elektra release of Shake It Up is *NOT* HDCD Remastered like The Cars, Panorama and Candy-O releases were, and it really shows. This budget release sounds dank and uninvolving, to say the least. While Heartbeat City was also not remastered, it sounds a bit better than SIU. I see that there is an OMR (original master recording) version available for $26.99 but who wants to pay that kind of money when the other remastered titles are so low priced. I guess I'll keep spinnin' my vinyl on this title for now..."
3,better then I remember,"I remember being disapointed with the polish and the silly title track(it's far better live)but this album I now find far more likeableI always liked Ocasek's quirkiness and they do stretch with ""dream away""other strong numbers are opener ""Since your gone"" ""Cruiser"" ""think it over"" and the percusiion of ""Maybe baby"" definitely eightiesand not anywhere near as good as there debut or Candy Oand not as interesting as Panoramabut still as I said better then I remember"
3,Okay but not great,"This is my least favorite Cars album. In fact, I like Door To Door better than this. But why? Well, the material on here just seems too jolly. In stark contrast to Panorama, which was moodier, artsy, and somewhat cold, Shake It Up is very festive. Sure, it's got some great tracks on it, like ""Since You're Gone,"" ""Shake It Up,"" and the excellent ""Cruiser,"" but a lot of the stuff just doesn't have the punch that Heartbeat City does, or the experimentation on their first three albums.My advice: if you're a die hard Cars fan, you should get this anyway. If you're not, check out their self-titled debut album first."
2,dissapointing,After a debut masterpiece and an excellent follow up I found the cars album shake it up to be disappointing. The main fault is in the lack of good material. It feels like a rushed product lacking so much of the originality and spirit that made the first two albums so great. It does have some strong moments but those are few and far in between. Only for the most die hard cars fans otherwise you can skip this one.
3,THE BEGINNING OF THE END,"This release was an o.k. album but you had come to expect so much more from the Cars from the previous three releases. WHen you sell millions of records without a hit single (Panorama) I am not sure why the title cut was needed. There are some other good songs here (""I'm Not the One"" and ""Cruiser"" in particular) but you can get those on the Anthology. Not much else here mentioning."
3,A Step In The Right Direction!,"The Cars getback to the sound and style that made them a success. Not the ""arty"" style (thank god!) of Panorama. More of the fresh and fast pace that we came to depend on. A drive with the Cars is not a stroll, but a quick journey to fun, pain and rejection!"
1,Only has 13 tracks (not 18) ; sound quality is really poor,"The sound quality is like that of an old record & 5 tracks listed in the catalog are missing. They are: Canadian Sunset, Vaya Con Dios, Wonderland by Night, Exodus Song and Calcutta"
3,101 strings orchestra Hits of the 50's and 60's.,This is a nice easy-listening CD. Good for the office or background music.
3,"Enjoyable introduction, but there are more thorough books","One can enjoyably learn some Perl and genomics from Tisdall, but a more thorough approach is first using a dedicated Perl primer, like Pierce's ,Teach Yourself Perl in 24 Hours, or Schwartz & Chistiansen's, Learning Perl, and then studying the professional toolkit in Dwyer's Genomic Perl which is accompanied by 65 intuitively derived programs and modules."
3,Not really for beginners!,"It seems to be a very good book, but not basic at all! You need to know a lot of perl language before using this book."
4,Good reference for those new to programming,This book provides a quick and easy introduction to the subject and has clear and useful examples. Comming from a biology background I found the layout of the book and the clear explainations very helpful.
3,OK tutorial. Poor reference.,"I have used this book in a beginning Perl programming course for biology majors. While it is good if you sift through it from start to the end, I often found it impossible to find things when I needed to go back to remind myself of something. The index does not help, and there is no concise language reference anywhere.Also, I do not like the fact that it uses ""quick and dirty"" Perl (no ""use strict"" pragma). While it might be less confusing to skip it at the very beginning, very soon students start to waste too much precious class time trying to locate bugs that would make the program not compile with ""use strict"" in the first place (e.g. mistyped variable names)."
4,Reasonable book for learning Perl,"For the students of molecular biology and genetics, and also other bioinformatics-related departments, this book is an above-average supply to study Perl."
4,A good personal account of Galipoli,"Pvt horace Bruckshaw's diaries provide a detailed account of his participation in the Galipoli campaign from Jan. 1915 - Apr. 1916, and his service on the western front from May, 1916 - Nov 1916. Bruckshaw must have been quite a remarkable young man to have endured the hardships he faced with the stoicism and humor he demonstrates in his diaries. He died, killed in action, in April, 1917 - like so many others in that terrible war.The dairies are literate, day-to-day accounts of the alternating terror and mundane existance that every combat veteran is familiar with. Reading them one feels a bit voyeuristic, but I found the accounts fascinating. Unless you are a serious student of World War One or the Galipoli campaign, I don;t recommed this book - I am certain you would find it dry. For the scholar or compulsive WWI reader, this is a very interesting personal account."
2,OK book,"I bought this trying to prepare my daughter for a sibling, but didn't find it truly helpful. She liked looking at the pictures of other animal babies... but I don't think any real baby-big sister connections were made as a result of the book."
5,This GRRL Rocks when she has fun!,"How amazing is Cyndi Lauper? This album is one of the 1990's must under appreciated albums ever. From the opening track SISITERS OF AVALON's rock tinges to the disco beats in THE BALLAD OF CLEO & JOE and to the stunning HOT GETS A LITTLE COLD - Cyndi Laupetr is a true artist with a silken voice taht can build up in a dance hall beat and reduce you to tears with a ballad the next.I remeber when she was doing press on the album, and she did an acoustic version of the song FEARLESS on Rupaul's VH1 talk show. It was simple, elegant and mesmerizing to sit and hear her voice.She is an artist who has grown tremendously and radio stations need to rediscover this gem of an album!"
5,Cyndi Lauper is better than ever!,"Sisters of Avalon should remind any music fan why Cyndi Lauper was popular in the 80's. She takes creative chances and again she hits the mark. She still makes you want to dance and sing along on songs like ""You Don't Know"" and the title track. If you were ever a fan of Cyndi's or if you want to hear something refreshing buy this one. You'll get such pleasure from hearing great music that radio isn't cool enough to overplay!!"
2,"Something's wrong with it, but maybe it's me","I guess I liked her first three albums so much that I expected something in the same key. But the times and style have changed, and Cyndi grew up too. This album just didn't do it for me, except for ""Hot gets a little cold,"" a very touching song. Everybody here seems to like it, and I feel odd, but oh well, I just express my impressions."
1,Cyndi's worst album,"I really dislike this one. I think ""Sisters of Avalon"" is her weakest album, along with ""a night to remember"". The title track is very bland and unmemorable and the other songs are boring or just plain bad. I don't know why most people think this album is so great. I recommend ""12 deadly sins"" ""true colors"" or ""merry christmas..have a nice life"" instead of ""Sisters of Avalon""."
3,Not what I thought,"I have two other CDs from Cyndi Lauper that are different from her 80s music, and I love them, but this one just did not do it. Some tracks were good, and maybe it will grow on me, but I was not as impressed as I thought I would have been."
4,When Hot gets a little Cold,"...an appropriate sub-title for ""Sisters of Avalon"", as Lauper returns to the subtle hip-hop arrangements from the uneven ""Hat Full of Stars"". But that album was kept exciting and interesting due to a perplexing mix of moody material. Here, only ""You Don't Know""(a terrific single), ""Hot Gets a Little Cold"", ""Fall into Your Dreams"" and ""Mother"" really capture the essence of Lauper as an expanding musical force. The title track peters out before it's over and ""Unhook the Stars"" and ""Searching"" are a bit too windy and directionless. Still, it ends on a cheery note(with a head-scratching ode to lesbian love!)and Lauper as a performer is as engaging as ever. 'B'"
3,Unfolding Over Time,"It's an interesting album if not her most accessible. A few of the songs (""Searching"", ""Say A Prayer"" & ""Mother"") kind of blend together. ""Love To Hate"" is one of my least favorite Cyn songs. The rest of the songs are sheer brilliance, especially; ""You Don't Know"", ""Brimstone & Fire"", ""Unhook The Stars"" & ""Fearless"".FOR COLLECTORS: The version of ""Early Christmas Morning"" on this import is different than the version on ""Merry Christmas...Have A Nice Life."""
1,I'd rather eat mud than read this whole book,I'd rather eat mud than read this whole book. It is sooodry and I hate it. If you want to read a book that manipulate intersting subjects such as levitation than buy this book. It could even make the fantastic tale of Harry Potter become wretchedly boring!
4,A mostly winning formula,"A passionate, soulful white R&B singer, Jon B. (for Buck) had a gold album the first time out, and not without good reason. His crooning on sensual slow jams like ""Pretty Girl"" and ""Burning 4 You"" is smooth as butter and very reminiscient of Babyface, who reportedly had some writing and/or production credits for this album. These types of songs are what Jon B. does best, but unfortunately he tries to have it both ways here, and the formula does turn a little sour when he tries to get hip-hoppish."
5,BONAFIDE IS GREAT!!!!,"While I do like some of the songs on Jon's follow-up cd's, none have come close to the songs on Bonafide! From beginning to end, it is a wonderful ride. The climax of this cd is the truly underrated ""Love Don't Do""....I will just say that for anyone who has ever been in love and gotten hurt, this song will definitely speak wonders to your heart! Jon does a lot of ad-libbing towards the end of some of his slower songs which in my opinion brings out a truly unique soulful sensation that is lacking in music today."
5,You have got to hear this,"Jon B's debut album BONAFIDE is all that. For a young man to come out with such strong melodic tunes is amazing. Someone to Love which is the first single Jon B released with singer songwriter Babyface is beautiful. Jon and Face's voices flow together wonderfully. Pretty Girl was Jon's next cut, and this single makes everyone woman want to be his pretty girl. As the title states- It's a BONAFIDE album and Jon B is a BONAFIDE artist."
5,Good Debut,Jon B's first CD was what R&B fans had been waiting for. There hadn't been a white male solo singer to get love from the R&B community since Bobby Caldwell. I remember when the CD released in 1997 it featured the huge single Someone To Love and also featured the exclllent ballads Time After Time and Pretty Girl. Jon B released three more excllent CD'S after this and has a new one due in 2007.
5,PAUL NEWMAN AS COOL HAND LUKE!!,"This is my favorite Paul Newman Movie.The most eggs I've ever seen someone eat in one hour.This is a timeless classic, I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!"
3,Poor sound,"Was so excited to get on Blue ray But not happy when watching, played on new 46 in Samsung LED with surrondsound Great picture Very POOR Sound.."
5,The finest film never to win an ocar,"Eddie Peabody, known as ""King of the Banjo"" to millions of banjo fans worldwide for more than half a century, was perhaps the most famous banjo player of all time. His popularity survived two world wars, vaudeville and the great depression. In Eddie, with a shock of corn-yellow hair and small stature (5',5"" tall), one could find the full scope and meaning of the banjo played with superb mastery. he was jealous of luke and decided to play the fiddle .Now would you kindly shut your mouth kind sir."
5,Newman's classic role holds up!,"The title and my title says it all, and thats all I have to say about that. Really, oh come on"
3,Good Story ... but slow by today's standards.,"This movie was great! Back in the 1920's maybe. Paul Newman really makes it watchable and his portrayal of Luke makes you keep watching. There were several parts where I got bored, but nonetheless, I finished it! What we have here is a failure to communicate...well not anymore...we have cell phones, emails, text messages, websites, etc etc etc. And yes, I know the movie is from the 60's."
3,Cool Hand Luke,"Luke is a good flick, solid cast,a young Hooper,George Kennedy,Paul Newman.Brutally honest yet for me strikes too much Anti-Establishment,Yes I rooted for Luke and the guys, but This quintessential 60's movie can drag on,I also take offense to Anti-God Diatribes no matter how subtle. (with the exception of one part of course)the movie is depressing as it was meant,A notable effort in cinema.Certainly I am Anti-Establishment,Anti-Liberal,Anti-Hippie which I see as part of the establishment especially in hollywood.This movie would probably be good to watch if one is a lawless washed up 60's lib with nothing notable to do than spread fascist indoctrination of the liberal sort.you hippies should conform already,your generation is done."
1,Cool Hand Luke,"When I opened the case the DVD was not there, very unusual which also makes it impossible to review or even to view???????I/We purchased 11 titles altogether and 8 arrived with the other 3 still comming and apart from the 1 missing DVD the other 7 that did arrive were Great.Rick T."
2,"Slow-moving, predictable prison film","""Cool Hand Luke"" is one of those heavy-handed 1960s message films - set in a rural southern prison it features brutal guards and sensitive, misunderstood prisoners.These prisoners are meant to be tough but you get the feeling they would be eaten alive today. Paul Newman is excellent as always and the sole reason for watching this film. George Kennedy won an Oscar for his performance but it is forced and mannered by today's standards.Wildly over-praised this film begins to drag pretty quickly and builds to a predictable conclusion."
4,"Superb performances, with a look that's enhanced by the Blu-ray technology","Paul Newman is of course the standout performer in this celebrated movie, but the entire cast is terrific.It's more of a meditative film than an uplifting or dazzling one, but it moves along crisply with interesting plot twists. It also rewards multiple viewings with a lot of subtleties that are easily missed on the first viewing. Blu-ray technology sometimes doesn't add much to an older film, but here it really works -- deepening colors, making close-ups more revealing, and generally adding texture and freshness to the look of the film. This DVD is an especially good choice at the bargain price it seems to be selling for."
4,Classic Newman,"Any Paul Newman fan should own this. One of my favorite movies by one of the classiest Hollywood leading men, EVER!"
2,They botched the DVD,"One of the best movies made during my lifetime (born 1952), they botched the DVD.The image quality is average at best and if you factor in that this movie is a classic, the quality is poor. And, the special ""features"" are an insult to what this movie is, which is brilliance.As had been said before, this movie is brilliant if you like great acting, great cinematography and editing, and wonderful scripting.Beyond that stuff, it is supremely entertaining.My guess/hope (I guess) is that they are throwing out this mediocre transfer prior to releasing the ""quality"" version.They should be ashamed."
4,You just gotta love Luke. For better or for worse.,"Cool Hand Luke is just great, classic viewing entertainment. Paul Newman's spirit of non-conformity is so powerful. When we see him smiling in that opening freeze-frame, That classic frame, right then and there we automatically know we're dealing with a man who's head-and-shoulders above the rest. The system will never understand him. There's this feeling that's he's always got something up his sleeve for them. And we see that. There's a quality of life in him, that, even by the end, is never extinguished. Because his legacy carries on. Here's a man who won't betray who he is. Refuses to be catagorized. You gotta love Luke for who he is. The system can't keep him down. He's going to keep going..... push the limits......"
3,Great movie - but mono sound?,I guess they are preserving the original feel of the old-time classic but I would have expected at least some updated sound option like at least stereo. Mono sound with a Blu-Ray? Seems like blasphemy.
5,Classic!!,Loved it!! Great movie!! Great story and many great lines in this one. An all time favorite. If you've never seen it I highly recommend it.
5,Daughter,"My Daughter is into film, and she loves these ""old"" movies, she has enjoyed watching Paul Newman and his acting."
4,simple movie in a simple time,"this is one of those movies no matter where you come in, channel surfing immmediately stops & someone always says ""I didn't know this came on today"". Without a doubt, its a favorite movie for whole family. As we've aged, the Newman appeal hasn't.Hope EVERYONE has a SAFE & MERRY CHRISTMAS! And brings in 2008 just as SAFELY! :)"
3,Cool Hand Luke,Good classic movie. My son used it for completing a portion of a boy scout merit badge. Paul Newman was a driving force in the prison and influenced all
5,It's the classic.....,"This is the classic. The one that all the guys talk about. Any guy that has ever been incarcerated, any guy that has a menial job or an over bearing employer knows this movie. ""I'm shaking the bush boss"". My wife and I were around a table with several friends doing a task when that line from the movie came up and my wife didn't know what we were talking about. So that is why I rented it for the umpteenth time. [[ASIN:B001EC2IXK Cool Hand Luke."
5,A must see,"This is by far one of the greatest movies of all times. Paul Newman is amazing, the ultimate rebel. Who else would cut the heads off parking meters because ""Small town, not much to do in the evenin."""
2,Classic and classically boring,"I have to admit Newman puts up excellent performance in Cool Hand Luke. But the film is really quite boring and Luke just gets annoying after a while. He annoys because he doesn't really want to escape prison and just wants to get caught. Of course this just serves to emphasize his existentialist nature, but it ends up being silly to a skeptic like myself."
1,a problem with the video,dvd would not play in blue ray or regular dvd-Region error. I tried it in multiple dvd that are known to work.It always said region error.
2,Cool Hand Like DVD was not usable at all,DVD was loose in its packaging allowing it to be scratched and totally non usable from receipt making the total purchase a loss...
5,Pelican Case,"We have used several Pelican cases for misc items at my office. The foam allows you to custom cut to fit anything you like. We use these for our cameras, scale maters, misc. electronics that go to the construction job sites. The case is extremly sturdy. These are also great for people who travel with fragile items. I highly recommend these cases and we will gladly use over and over again."
5,Good value for money (...),"For the price offered, it's hard to beat. The XP-M processor is the counterpart to the Pentium-M and saves battery power. Plus, with 802.11g and an 80GB drive, it fulfills all my needs as amedia desktop as well. Great functions for a low price. [...]Two thumbs up for Averatec."
1,You should know how much I am mad at the Averatec laptop.,"This is my first time to review a product! I cannot believe this product has this much high rating! Don't be deceived by the previous compliments to this product. Now I seriously regret that I spent my money on this shoddy laptop. Now I'm searching for a new laptop just one year after I bought this product. This laptop has tons of defects, but especially the AC adapter sucks! It is really hot not in a good way, the battery life is short, the speaker sound is bad, the fan is VERY noisy, and the AC adapter stopped working because it melted the plastic around the connector. If you have enough money to check whether my complains are true, buy it as you please. Otherwise, keep my warnings in mind!"
2,Not comfortable,"I have been wearing New Balance sneakers for over ten years and this is not their finest product. I purchased these for just strolling around the park with the kids, no long distances, but they were quite annoying. The sole is recessed and there is an odd portion on the end of the shoe that rubs your heel as you step. Unfortunately, I tried to go up a size and had the same result.They look really nice but they're not worth the discomfort. I suggest that you take a good walk around a footwear store with these on before you add to the unwanted shoes in your closet."
4,Great fun!!!,"Im upset at some of these reviews...i cant believe people dont like it because it is too unbelievable....unbelievable???? This is nothing compared to other action movies, in fact, it is probably one of the more believable ones out there...this is a great film, it is never boring and always exciting and some of the twists are so good....its a perfect action movie and one I definitely recommend...."
2,They never let poor Rudolph...,"Boy. There are very few times when I leave a theatre dissatisfied, but Reindeer Games was definitely one of them. With three castmembers I typically enjoy (Affleck, Theron and Sinise), I don't know how this film could have disappointed more. The convoluted plotline only gets worse as the film goes home...and only God knows what Bruckheimer was thinking when he shot that ending. Best watch this film in the company of friends a la Mystery Science Theatre 3000."
2,Where's the action?,"That's what we were asking while watching this mess of a movie. It seems that this movie wastes more time in stupid dialog than in the action piece. Now I know most action movies have stupid dialog, but they make up for it in excitement, Reindeer games had no excitement at all. Save yourself a couple of hours and skip this movie."
3,Not the best movie I've seen but doable,"Reindeer Games has a great cast-Affleck, Theron, Sinise, Farina and Williams III. It has a nifty plot-Rudy (Affleck) assumes the identity of his fallen cellmate Nick and, upon release from prison, hooks up with Ashley, Nick's penpal. So why was I distinctly underwhelmed? Maybe it was Affleck's performance. I love Ben but I think he was miscaast. I didn't for once believe that he was a car thief. Sinise delivers his umpteenth performance as a baddie (been there, done that). The plot is generic until the end, which is the only reason for the 3 stars I rated it."
2,Exhausting w/ Nice Ending - Comedic Special FXs,I enjoyed the ending. I just wanted to write this because I believe the explosion of the car going over the cliff is the worst example of special fx modelling I have seen since the early days of this. Check out the flames - It will make you laugh. Plot is a little too much for us to believe. The Charitable ending was neat. It just needed a better movie behind it.
2,reindeer games,this movies was such a dissapointment to me that it mad me sick. It is so confusing and pointless that I couldnt help but to laf at how stuped and pointless it was.
2,SKIP IT,"I skip any film featuring Ben Affleck because, after watching some of them, I think he's a really bad actor. I forgot my own rules and watched this one here. What a garbage."
1,Blech!,"For every film I enjoy with Ben Affleck (Chasing Amy, Dogma), he seems to come out with two that stink! (Armagedon, Reindeer Games, Pearl Harbor, etc). He's over-rated, and can only play about one character... my guess is he's not acting, that's just who he is, and every now and then a script fits his personality very well. This script is so bad that it doesn't matter who is in it... the movie just stinks."
4,Great Fun,"This movie has non stop thrills and action.The plot is great.The acting is great such as Ben Affleck,Charlize Theron and Gary Snise."
3,Not as good as I had expected.,"I was expecting more after seeing the previews of this movie. I found the beginning of the story to go very slow. It seems to take a long time to get to the ""point"" of the film. The action scenes in the casino were very good but were over to quickly. The movie seemed to build up to this scene for so long and once it got there it did not expand on it as much as I would have liked. The ending had lots of twist and turns, almost too many. It was getting to seem that another twist was added to the last twist, just to add yet another twist (if that makes any sense).I have a feeling this would be a much better book then it was a movie. The director took too much time setting up the viewer with the information that would be the first few chapters of the novel and then had to hurry up and put all the action and the twist to the plot in the finale."
4,Excellent popcorn movie,"I went into this with a ""well, this is all they had at the video rental store at 11:55pm on a Saturday night and I know better but I want to watch SOMETHING"" attitude. But I came out pretty pleased. This is not a great film. But it's well paced, suspenseful, and boasts some good plot twists.The acting by Affleck and Sinese is top rank. Theron doesn't so much act as provide delicious eye candy. If you look like Theoron, and you don't have to carry the movie, you get a pass and she gets that pass here.This is no Arlington Road (a movie that share's the same writer); that is an example of a GREAT movie in this suspense-with-clever-plot twists genre. But this movie is a terrific popcorn movie. Sit back and be entertained. Note: be sure you engage your willing suspension of disbelief before starting the movie.dap"
5,Good Movie !,Pretty good movie. You need to pay attention to this movie since there are many twists. The ending is good !
4,Superb,"I know this movie didn't do well at the box office by either the critics or the audiences; but I find it terrific action and wild, twisted storyline to be one good ride. There is nudity and sex, and lots of bloodshed, but again, that is becoming standard these days on regular TV. If you like double-twists in storylines, and plenty of action, then this is one for you. And oh yes, Gary Sinise as the chief villain is definitely a killer!! Enjoy."
2,A surprise ending save this movie,"You have to sit through at least an hour of this movie before it starts to get your attention. The casino robbery scene is quite exciting and the DVD provides good 5.1 surround activities. And the surprise ending saves this movie from being below average action movie. The story is about a convict (Ben Affleck) who just released from prison and was mistaken as ex security guard from a small casino and forced to rob the casino. Sounds good, well let me tell me it is very boring until the last 30 minutes or so. If you are looking for a good action DVD, this is not it."
2,I wasted two hours of potential sleep time for this?,"This film, while not really awful, is quite bad. The plot is forced, the dialogue is just bad, and it contains a performance by Gary Sinise that one is tempted to call ""hammy."" The only actors to retain their dignity are the ones with little screen time, namely Donal Logue (Pug) and James Frain (Nick). At least Affleck's accent is consistent.I thought this would be a good Friday-night-with-chinese-food flick, but it's not even fun. The fault lies in the script, because all problems can be directly attributed to the writing, including the twist at the end.The actors give it their best, and Frankenheimer does what he can to keep the pace up, but there's really nothing that can be done to salvage this patently unnecessary waste of time.Just skip it."
4,I think about it often,It's been a couple months since I saw Reindeer Games on DVD. I liked it then and I think about the plot twists often today. It is visceral entertainment and not meant to be cerebral.
2,rediculous from start to finish.,"A guy in prison decides he wants to rob the casino he once worked in. Since this is likely to be dangerous he dupes his cellmate into comitting the crime. But poor Ben (who, in some scenes can hardly keep from laughing) doesn't know anything about the casino. Oops.Now I understand this is not a documentary but this is so utterly unbelieveable that it spoils everything. The problem is, there isn't any reason for the bad guys to keep Ben around--except that he's the star.Big comedy potential, especially with the Santa suits."
3,santa's a couple of reindeer short for a sleigh ride...,"...went to see it at the movies in stadium seating, very psyched for what i was about to encounter, then ""thud"". it just didn't move me. it has all the potential of being a great flick but something was missing. i can't place my finger on it, but it was missing something. it's well worth the rental fee but please rewind and return on time. it's a grade ""A"" watch. i repeat.""A"" watch, meaning one viewing then you can say you saw it and move on to bigger and better movies. maybe one cold sunday night past 10 p.m. after knowing where your children are and ""Reindeer games"" happens to come on one of those cable t.v. channels that your legally being ripped-off by, i'll lay in my bed with the lights down low and give it another watch....it's my prerogative.peace and God blessp.s. sorry for the lower cases."
2,DO NOT PURCHASE!,I bought this DVD and I have to tell you that this has been one of the worst movies I have watched this year!The storyline is not so bad but it's things like the cheesy lines and may I say HORRIBLE acting that make this such a dumb movie!I gave it 2 stars and not 1 because of the plot twists and Charlize...other than that....my advice is rent....and on a rainy day!
1,Reindeer Poop,"Why let logic get in the way of a movie's ending? Why do we need script writers at all? Let's just put some good looking people on the screen, add some scary character actors and then blow stuff up. This movie starts outs ok but it is always desperate to find ways to keep this group of backstabbers together. The logic gets thinner and thinner as the movie goes along. It doesn't have a lot of logic to begin with but the ending is so laughably insane that you'll find it hard to believe. Any other special guest villians hinding in the wings? The movie is so intent on ""tricking"" you that it loses all believability. Just fast forward to Charlize's topless scene and then cut your losses."
1,Maybe i'm being a LITTLE harsh...but,"I love ben affleck, and this happens to be his worst film ever! Reindeer games finaly twists and turns until everyone gets killed, and you just can't figure out who the bad guy is...it changes all the time, till their all dead. HORRIBLE....to be honest though, and give the movie some credit, it was good until the ending, and was a very good idea."
1,If only a little enthusiasm were put into this film....,"Is it just me or is it as if everybody in ""Reindeer Games"" appears with a look on their face that screams ""I'm just here for the paycheck!"". This thriller by John Frakenheimer has an incoherent plot (like most action thrillers of late) and no energy whatsoever. The usually great Affleck, Theron, and Sinise all look so bored and depressed while onscreen. The stupid plot twists which make absolutely no sense could have been easily forgiven had the actors put a little energy and enthusiasm into their roles. Affleck was just plain cheesy. Theron was annoying as was Sinise. I'm not even going to start on the supporting characters played by James Frain and Dennis Farina. I strongly suggest that if you're in the mood for an action thriller that's actually fun that you need to keep on moving. ""Reindeer Games"" is definitely not fun...."
3,Some cats know how to force it open.,"This cat door has a small key that switches the door to either fully locked, fully open, in only and out only. When in the position chosen, it does stay in place. There is no way for it to accidenatally lock itself due to the way the locking mechanism works. Easy installation instructions. It is made out of a heavy duty plastic that is spray-paintable (I painted mine black with spray paint made for plastic to match by screened door).I have had it for over a year, and recently adopted a new cat. This cat forces it open with ease. The main problem about this, is that once it is forced open, the other cat can follow, and then both can't get back inside. I now regret not buying one of the models with the solid panel that slides down over the flap to lock the door.All in all, this door is great, unless you have a determined cat...in which case, you'll be in my boat!"
2,flap broke in 1.5 year,"It worked okay for a year and a half. Then, when one of my cats came in through the door, the corner of the plastic flap broke. I tried to superglue it, but that didn't work. The only way to replace it is to get a whole new unit. The company wanted to charge me more than I paid in a store for a new unit. So much for their ""limited lifetime warranty."""
3,Not that sturdy,"I just bought my second one of these, having owned the last one for 18 months.The only reason I bought this model again is the original flap was broken to the extent that the door would not stay in place and we had a hole where a door once sat. I needed a quick fix. I intend to buy a better model when my work schedule permits me to fit a different style door.The Cons:The tunnel that connects the inner and outer doors doe not attached securely, it clips together very loosely and can fall out.The tunnel attaches on the inside, and protrudes on the outside; it is not secured between the two sides. From the outside, with very little force, you can slide the tunnel out.The door flap is held in place by two very flimsy pins.The lock is easily defeated by a determined cat; one of our cats just bats its paws against it until it opens.The Pros:It comes with 3 different length sets of screws to accommodate different door thicknesses."
2,Cat Flap,The cat flap is less easy to use than expected. The magnetic catch at the bottom adds resistance and confuses the cats. The large external door restricts the entrance to slender cats.
1,Cat Flap,"We were disappointed it only had one magnet, as we have two cats. I must have missed something on the description.? drg"
5,This is the ultimate screwdriver,"I'm surprised I'm the first to review this. All the bits and pieces you need in their own rubber holder and if you will only need a few and don't want to carry the whole holder to a job, you can flip the top open and drop in the bits you need. Well made, tough enough for electronics repair or a home tool box. I'm picky about my tools and only buy good stuff. This is good stuff."
4,The Discussion Begins,"The Dan K Theory (out of Athens, Ga.) combines alot of talent and some ""JAMMING"" details...this is good, smiling jam/funk/jazz oriented music and not a bad cut on it. JJ Cale and Funky Meters influences; and maybe a little Phish-y-esque on the ends..and some additional pedal steel by Atlanta artist, Mark Van Allen round this out nicely."
5,great for teenagers and their parents,This book gives a variety of stories of kids their brief history of why their room is like it is.It's like being a fly on the wall.In the sometimes confusing time of being a teenager you realize you are not alone.
2,Bossa Nova modernized,"This is the same Marcos Valle who was a mover and shaker of the original bossa boom. The liner photos show how very pretty he was then, and how much the worse for wear he looks now. His music has changed in much the same way. I don't like to listen to this album often, because every track goes on far too long. The old melodic flair is still there in places - the best is 'Mushi Mushi' - and he has modernized his style by adding elements of pop and jazz; it is only fair to add that some people will like it that way. Valle's keyboard playing is much featured, and most tracks are instrumentals. He sings on 'Mushi Mushi' and there is also a female vocalist on a few tracks. I was recommended to buy this by a young fan of Brazilian music, but I prefer the old Valle of the 60s."
5,Simply beautiful,What beautiful expressions of love--words and actions--in this fictional memoir of a woman! One must read it to appreciate the simple beauty and joy of its sentiments as well as the simply beautiful writing style of its author.
5,Such a beautiful story!,"I have read many books over the years but can't remember one that has touched me so deeply. Although a city girl, I appreciated the description of farm life and the closeness of those who work the land. However, the details of the feelings and life of Hannah and her husband, Nathan hit home with me. I was at the beach with my husband of 28 years celebrating my 55th birthday while reading the book. Several times I handed the book to him so that he could read the author's view of the beauty of mature love. It was also meaningful to him. The sorrows and eventually, joys, of empty-nesting have never been described so accurately. What an accomplishment of a male writing from a woman's outlook! This is the first book I have read by Wendell Berry but it will not be my last. Thank you, Mr. Berry, for making my birthday so special."
4,excellent,"HANNAH COULTER: This book was delightful. Not a heavy read, but such a pleasant one. Hannah was such a wise women and shared her wisdom with those around her and the reader. Thoroughly enjoyed this book."
3,book,"While the lyrical prose of Hannah Coulter was a joy to read, the story was at times plodding and long. Berry did capture the sense of how the dreams of a parent for a child is a two edged blade. Hannah and Nathan wanted and provided the very human dream for their off-spring - education as a means to a better life, but the very thing they wanted for their children was the means for them to fledge the nest and move away to a life distant from their parents. It was a good read, but not a great read."
3,A country read,"This story is lovely, but reads rather slow. Has much detail about the people of the county their life style."
1,Didnt watch it,Sorry no review cause I never got around to watching it. It might be a good film so dont take my star rating seriously.
2,"Hated the bed, love the bed cover!","My dogs did not like this bed at all!!! The cedar smell was too strong. Also, it is divided into two interior pillow cases. As a result, there is a crease down the middle that gets worse as the dogs lay on it. I did like the cover, though, with the rugged outdoor friendly bottom. Ended up removing the cedar and dumping outside for mulch. Ordered 4"" twin size memory foam bed topper then cut two pieces (one for each dog bed) to fit exactly in the cover. Kept the egg crate foam that comes with the bed. Now the dogs love my home made version and it was much cheaper (cost of original bed + memory foam) than buying a ready made memory foam dog bed."
4,Recommended,"My daughter has been playing all of the I Spy games since she was about 5 and she thinks they're terrific. She is now 7 and still enjoys them. We parents find them plenty clever and interesting, too. As a bonus, they work seamlessly on our Mac. This is the most basic of the several I Spy games we own, and is better for younger kids; the other games are much better. But this one is still recommended."
1,I Spy School Days,The I Spy School Days was a disaster. Did not work on any of the 6 computers we tried it on. Tried it with all kind of Window programs. Have many other I Spy discs that have been great. Would not recommend this.
3,The scent of dissertation is strong,"A sturdy account of the life of an interesting and productive woman, now underestimated as a writer, is seriously marred by the scent of dissertation that hangs over it. Too often the best writing belongs to extended quotes from the subject's fiction presented as biographical facts. It reads very much like a dissertation on ""Possible Parallels between the Life and Fiction of Fanny Trollope"" with both the juicy bits of life and fiction, and the weasel words of academic caution omitted. I would have found some family trees of the tightly interlocking social circles Fanny Trollope moved in far more intriguing than the illustrations included."
2,Fact or Fiction?,"This is one of those biographies in which the writer assumes that the subject's life is reflected in her fiction. It's a chore to separate the fictional quotations from the actual life. It's also one of those annoying biographies that is full of phrases like ""She may have. . ."" and ""We may assume that she. . . ."" When the biographer has no facts, she puts her subject into the contemporary scene and then suggests activities for her that she may or may not have engaged in. This method of writing biography is dreadfully out of date."
2,ALL FIRED UP FOR NOTHING,Man where do I start. I saw the Faces with Rod back in 1972 in Chicago. I was 17 years old. Ron Layne was playing bass back then and that is one of the things you notice about this dvd right off the bat. He was just as important to this band as Rod Stewart was. The quality of sound and picture is terrible. It looks as if it was recorded on 8 mm film. I know this concert is 32 years old. But I bought the Led Zeppelin DVD with footage that was older than this and they did a masterful job on the picture and sound quality. I really feel that anyone except hardcore Faces and rock historians will find this dvd worth putting on on front of your friends. This really made me think about how I will buy my dvds in the future....
5,Enlightening Book,"If for no other reason, this book provides an understanding of the perils of programs that go too far and actually end up harming the causes they stand for. Darren Lossia"
4,An excellent primer of libertarian ideas.,"Browne does an excellent job of explaining Libertarianism without going over anyone's head. It is highly readable, concise, and compelling. He takes us on a journey through the history of the United States, showing us where we have gone wrong and what we can do to get back on track."
4,Something completely different....NO GOVERNMENT!!!!!,"Interesting theories, but totally unrealistic and sometimes scarey! This book is great for fans of politics."
4,An excellent presentation of the Libertarian viewpoint,"Harry Browne's new book ""Why Government Doesn't Work"" provides a concise analysis of the common flaws inherentin Government programs, and presents a common-sense alternative to them. The book is well-written, presenting the Libertarian case in a non-confrontational manner. This is a must read for anyone interested in alternatives to the two party monopoly this election year."
5,Gohan failed. Vegeta failed. Can Goku beat Buu?,"Well, Gohan was nearly killed, and Vegeta was killed trying to stop Majinn Buu. Now, it's Goku's turn in the ring, and with everyone in the world watching, Goku, having powered up to Super Saiyajin 3, battles it out with the fat pink blob. The fight scene is AWESOME, and beyond words, as the two pummel each other, refusing to yield in battle. It's not as good as Goku and Majinn Vegeta's fight in ""Rivals,"" and ""The Hatching,"" but it's definitely up there in the top five. If you're a Goku fan(like me), you owe it to yourself to buy this volume immediately. If you're a just plain DBZ fan, well, you still owe it to yourself to buy this one!"
3,The Gin Game,I love the story but the picture isn't too good. I will watch it again aas it has been a while.
3,satisfied,I was very satisfied with the item appreciated the free gift and I recieved the merchandise in a very timely fashion. Good experience.
4,A great book for those who need help in applying wicca.,"Ms. Telesco is one of the best authers to write about wicca. She wicca out of the just ritual trappings and teaches you to live wicca. The first part of this book is a great self help manual. She gives activities that every one should try. It will help you to see your self in a divine light, and make it brighter if you already do. She then gives examples of how to use daily chores such as cooking and clipping cupons in a magickal way. A great book for people who are finding it hard to apply magick in there every day lives. The God and Goddess are every were and all things are magick, even if it is only the laundry."
3,"Too ""New Agey""","If you consider yourself a ""New Age"" Witch, then this book is good for you. If you don't, please walk away from this book. I was ""very"" suprised that Patricia Telesco was more of a ""New Age"" Witch because so many Witches/Wiccans like her books. I do like her other books like ""The Wiccan Book of Ceremonies and Rituals"", which I think is a great book. But I feel that this book is useless and that her other book ""An Encanted Life"" is much better, but still ""New Agey"", although she is different because she actually wants to save money.I gave this book three stars because it has good ideas and is good for self-esteem. I hope this review helps you. Buy this book if you completelly love the author, but keep in mind that you already know this stuff."
5,It sounds awesome! I think it's the best one yet.,"Here are the girls' names: Heather Floyd, Denise Jones, Terry Jones, and Shelley Phillips. I have all four of their albums and I think it's all beautiful. The combination of music types make the album sound great!"
5,Great musical variety with the best tight harmony!,"Point of Grace is by far the best female group for achieving tight vocal harmony, highlighting different musical styles and paces. Though I might skip through some tracks depending on my mood, I find myself replaying others until I can't remember how many times I've sung along - most notably Jesus Will Still Be There, No More Pain and This Day. My college aged daughter likes it equally well."
5,Fantastic arrangments w/ alot of heart and soul.,"I own over 250 cd's from all types of music and these four ladies are my favorite. I have their 3 cd's and video, waiting on the new release of Steady On coming sometime in August. If you're looking for some christian music w/ a top 40 beat, you won't go wrong w/ Point of Grace!"
2,Not What I Expected...,"This is the first time that the negative reviews I read were right. This is not the kind of book I wanted, there is not a lot of information on important things and mostly tells you to take it to the shop. Almost half the book is information on buying a new car, which cars are great to buy, should you lease, buying a new or old car, etc, etc etc. I already bought my car (duh!) and found this pretty useless."
4,Good Start!,This book speaks to the basics of auto maintenance written for non-mechanics (male of female). The author has a legitimate background in auto repair. Her ability to make things basic and understandable is a treat.
3,Great fun for a group of intelligent people,"The quiz format was a blast as my enitre family of brilliant minds listened and answered. We enjoyed the questions, the challenge and the game! Much more interesting than the book version simply because it could be shared. For those of us who love trivial information and think there is little as fun as learning new things (and laughing at what we thought we knew but didn't), it is a blast. It wasn't meant for non-thinkers or impatient people (or the kind that look at the answers to their crossword puzzel!)."
2,not what i expected,i was disappointed when i bought this for my reasonably advanced 7 year old but found it was STILL out of his range - a lot of fine print reading and quite in depth ... i wouldnt suggest this for any child under the age of at least 12
3,A Gift,"For all you people who question everything, this book is for you. It talks about all the crazy things that exist and why."
4,Great for inquisitive kids,Our granddaughter was thrilled to receive this book for Christmas. She is very inquisitive and she loves to read. She especially likes to be able to have the answer to odd little questions people sometimes ask. At nine years of age she just likes to KNOW! It was a great choice for us.
4,Why do Clocks Run Clockwise?,"I've always been a Q&A; fan, so David Feldman's great books were just the thing I needed to read. There are questions for everyone, but the risk with that is that there are undoubtedly some questions you just won't be interested in. Many of the questions are also irrelevant in the modern world, as it is a slightly older book. I love the tone in Feldman's answers: sprinkled with sarcasm, making for an even more enjoyable read. As funny as the answers are, of all things, the illustrations accompanying some of the questions. Priceless!Rating: 4/5"
2,Don't waste your time,"This audio book is absolutely terrible. I sat down and listened to this thing, all 45 minutes of it, and was completely annoyed with the way the impoderables were discussed. They chose a stupid quiz format between three letters: A, B, and C. One answer was correct, but I was all wrong to buy this garbage."
3,Curiosity matters,"This tape deals in some curious questions and indeed these are imponderables. I managed to get a great score in the answers. Overall, I would say this is an ok book, although a little predictable."
3,Ercu & WHITE,"This bassinet cover is a good price and is good quality. I returned the cover because it is NOT ecru. It is ecru AND white. The outside skirt and the hood is ecru. However, the portion of the cover that covers the inside of the bassinet is white. I had also purchased ecru sheets to match. So, inside the bassinet you saw ecru sheets surrounded by a white cover. It just looked funny to me. I would recommend this item only if you don't mind the color combination."
4,"Very cute, not the best quality but still a good product","This bassinet liner, skirt and hood are very cute! The outside material seems a little rough and the sewing on the bow could have been done better... However, I'm hoping a delicate wash and a little extra stitching on the bow will help. I was given an older bassinet and it fits this perfectly and is cute enough that I don't want to return it!"
2,Not what I expected,I thought this product was the Thank you CD which has several songs. But instead it was a sound track for the song Thank You.
2,CD offered is mislabelled,"I ordered this CD because I wanted the ""Watch the Lamb"" song to give to someone as a gift. It is listed as ""Thankyou/Watch the Lamb."" That would make you think that the song ""Watch the Lamb"" would be on this CD. I rechecked to see if there were a list of songs on the CD on the site, but I couldn't find any. While I like anything by Ray Bolz, I would not have purchased this particular CD had it been correctly identified. I am sort of disappointed that I now have to buy another CD."
4,Mortal Kombat: Legacy,"This title was a long time in the making, at least for me. The last film from this series came out way back in 1997. So, there was a great deal of anticipation when I first noticed it on Amazon, and this item specifically was topped off rather pleasantly, considering I got lucky, and got it on Blu-Ray. The only reason I gave it a 4 star rating was because I didn't know that it wasn't going to actually be a movie, but a series with chapters that had originated online earlier this year, and I also found the chapter of Raiden quite disturbing. Anyways, for the most part, I'm very glad that I purchased it."
2,MORTAL COMBAT LEGACY,"Guess I didn't read enough about this before purchasing. Would be a very interesting concept for ""MORTAL COMBAT"". But the way this was put together was very disapointing...."
5,Simply amazing,A great live action mortal kombat just what any fan has been waiting for leaves you wanting more cant wait for season 2
4,Good Mortal Kombat reboot,"There are some good actors in the series. Keep in mind this is the collect web episodes, so they aren't that long. There are quite a few features on it. The only thing that really confused me, is that most of them are live action with cg, except for the Kitana and Mileena stories which are animated but have some live action fights. This is more for hardcore MK fans, the story is good, the fighting is great, but it's just so short and feels unfinished. Would love for them to make a movie from this though!"
4,MK IN HD,Great short clips. Big MK fan many years. Just can't wait to see what happens when the director get the budget for warner bros on the agreed movie deal. Any MK fan should have this title.
5,Awesome short films,I really like these short films..annoyingly too short but very well done. I love the character development and how the freshened the characters. Job well done...now if I they would just do a full-length feature film...hmmmmmm.
5,GREAT Series and So Much More,I already knew what to expect when i ordered the Blu-Ray but the behind the scenes footage was really the icing on the cake. REALLY GREAT STUFF!!!...this is a must buy for any MK Fan
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!,"I purchased this thinking it must be an action pack movie since some of the actors are known, however discovered this is not a movie but segments (very short segments). If it would had been a movie, it probably would have very good, however this proved to be very disappointing."
3,Why is this even on blu ray?,"It was an ok video series on youtube, but why would anyone pay $18 for something that is free to watch on youtube? Save your money because it is not worth it!"
1,Mortal Kombat: Legacy [Blu-ray,This was not a movie and it really sucked! Don't waste your money. I will re-sell this one on eBay!
4,"Great story, but cheap filming","The story on MK Legacy is very cool. It is unfortunate that it was done with such a low budget, :-(. If only they would invest on this, I am sure it would have a great turnaround for the investors. Try to make it as a 2 or 3 part movie and not just a cheap series. Because of the filming quality, is why I cant give it 5 stars, but the story def. deserves the 5 stars. Hopefully they will make a sequel and it will be a little better quality movie. About the actors... they were pretty awesome I would say, and the action as well."
4,The Legend Continues,"After watching all the Mortal Kombat films, I would say this was ok, but not great. They keep changing characters, so hard to keep up."
4,Loved the show. I want to see more!,"Loved the web series. I can't wait to watch it on the big screen in hi def. Yes it's free on youtube, but this is something I want to support as a fan, plus there are meant to be some great extras"
5,Need more,"Need more length (time) these would be great for trailers, it would be nice to see a full length movie or 1+ hour tv show the creator of these is really thinking. Having grown up with Mortal Combat always a fan even though the last movie was a let down."
5,i like it,good sfi fi good action it has everything that a sfi fi fan needs and it is a new twist on a old story
5,A must buy,This is so much better then the 2 other mortal kombat movies its so good! A must buy for any video game fan of the mortal kombat series!
3,Decent Reimagining,Saw the original mock trailer for this like a year ago and then followed up on it randomly a couple weeks ago. Bought it for a great price and I would say it is very entertaining. Only reason I wouldn't rate it 5 is because all of the stories are very short. Like 5-10 mins per character.I was hoping for like a mini-movie or something more then just barely touching on each character.I would recommend checking this out if you are a fan of Mortal Kombat
5,Buy it,"I will agree with other posters it is a good series i really wish they would make a full series made for TV out of this or a movie but i would prefer a series, This is really good for a webisode i am not a MK fan so to speak but the show/characters has rich back stories that one can pull from to make the show go really any way they want.Anyway i have long since watched this on the net but i bought it because its good and i am hoping they can take this somewhere, and really Jeri Ryan is just the best! come on show some love maybe?? no?I know they are making another season here's hoping they go all in."
5,Bow Wow Delicious,HiThis is Japser and I must tell you. My mom sure knows my taste buds. She chose the best ever.
3,What happened here?!?,Anticipation was high when I read that Megaherz had a new CD out. Unfortunately I'm rather disappointed. Where is energy that came thru Megaherz' music on the Himmelfahrt & Kopfschuss CDs? Only one track on the CD sounded a bit like the Megaherz sound I love. *sigh*
3,Is This The Real Megaherz?,"A very emotional album from Germany's own Megaherz, pretty uninspiring however. Megaherz went throught a transition, they obtained two new members, but lost the more important thing... their edge."
5,Good,"Herzwerk II is a great cd, The songs on this album are fast, heavy, and loud. Herzwerk II brings it all the way through.My Favorite songs are: 5 Mars, Perfekte Droge, Herzblut, and FFF"
3,It could have been better,"This CD sounds different from their other CDs. This was the first Megaherz CD I got, and I loved it, so of course I got their other CDs right away. Then I realized that it's not as good as Kopfschuss or Wer Bist Du. It seems like there's something missing on this CD, and it doesn't have nearly as much energy as their other CDs. This CD has good music, but it's just over-produced. Megaherz is a great band (although sometimes I think they sound a little too much like Rammstein), and I recommend this CD, but their older music is better."
2,Like chewing cotton wool,I had high hopes but this album is pretty much forgettable - bland and stodgy.
5,Clean and clear sound,"I bought this product in hopes of reducing background noise and it definitely worked. I get beautiful sound. At first I thought that my amp was bad.Before I changed to Monster interconnects, I was getting bad noise when, for example, the fog lights were on or the air conditioning was on high. Talk about embarrassing when you're trying to show off and its hot outside. So I quickly changed to Monster 202 and 204 LN Audio Interconnects and problem solved.A very tight fit as well, great connectors.Don't waste money with other products; go with Monster the first time, every time.-Keven"
3,Well constructed . ...But,"These are very serious cables, very thick jacket, very clean signal transfer, solid connectors. I purchased two of these along with a 2 channel pair for my sub amp and just love them. There is a major BUT though- just try to get these to unplug!!! I swear you almost have to put pliers on them to get them to disengage from their mated ends (and I mean its like they MATE 4 life). I had some problems and had to relocate and change amps around and had a real difficult time getting these off of the amp inputs and I literaly was in fear of damaging the amps. I wish I could tell you a trick learned to get them off (time, sweat and patience)all I can tell you is that if you buy a set of these know what you are in for! I can't beleive a company such as MONSTER would design these to grip so tightly that you cannot remove, or if there is a special trick put it in the manual. This is the only reason for 3 stars"
4,Good product.,"They work great, but as many of the other poeple has pointed out they are very tight when being installed and if you need to remove them I would be very carful not to pull the pins out of the amp or radio."
3,Moving Toward Mainstream,"As a long time M.P. listener I was disappointed with this effort. Not as much soul as ""Running From The Seasons"", not as much power as ""How Do You Live"". This CD seems to move toward a more generic, processed sound. Too bad, I really enjoyed the edgier cuts on her earlier outings (especially ""Seasons"")."
4,Blast from the Past,"This is a fun toy to record your garage band. Brings back memories of the symphony of young, aggressive music."
4,Just ok - not worth $5.50,I am avid stationary collector and sometimes I buy notebooks just because I think it is pretty. I decided to buy this because I thought it would be good to carry a pocket book to make adhoc list during meetings but just didn't find it useful.I am giving it 4 stars because the quality is good and the ink doesn't seep through. I don't have problem with the make. Please note it is really small - which will not work for note taking. Makes a good to-do book but not like a notebook. In the smartphone era - not worth 5.49.I am deducting 1 points for the price point.
5,Perfect Cookbook for Two,"Someone had lent me a copy of this book and I loved it. I had to have a book of my own. It is an excellent cookbook for a household of two. The recipes are practical, easy to prepare and most use everyday ingredients. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for tasty low-cal recipes for two."
2,Not the right CD set,"When I searched for this product, I entered the ISBN number for the CDs for the exercises book (the green book). Instead I received the CDs for the textbook (the yellow one), which is not at all what I wanted. I needed the exercises CD to actually do some of the exercises for class; now I have to find them elsewhere. You would think using the ISBN number would get you the correct product."
1,This dictionary is 50 years old!,"I bought this dictionary after seeing a glowing review, and once I received it I saw its original publication date was 1955! It has been reprinted a million times, but the content has not been updated in 50 years. Needless to say, the dictionary is completely useless, so I returned it. I am writing this to alert others who might be fooled by what seems to be a current publication date. The key thing to remember is that this dictionary is 50 years old and counting. A lot has happned in law and other areas since 1955! A whole lot!"
3,really noisy cooling fan!,"I've used HP DAT drives for ten years or so - internal SCSI til now - so I'm used to their noisy drive mechanicals. However, with this external drive, they've added a 400mm cooling fan that just screams. It'd be ok if the fan only ran when the drive was working - I do my backups overnight - but, alas, the fan's always on.Another oddity about the cooling design, is that there are no vents to let the cooling air in. There are 'pretend' vents on the front of the case, but they don't go all the way through the plastic. (Uh, hey HP, maybe if you vented the case, it wouldn't need such a noisy fan!)One last thing, is that HP requires if you're using a USB hub, the drive should be the only thing on it (and the point of a hub is....?)Otherwise, the drive seems to work well, and I've had very good response with customer service at HP."
2,Extremely Noisy,"I unpacked the drive, plugged it in and powered it up. Then I heard the noise. I turned off the drive, unplugged it and request an RMA."
3,"Salt, Vinegar and not much else","Louisiana Roasted red pepper hot sauce is very salty and light on pepper flavor. Unlike Tabasco brand and other premium pepper sauces this formula doesn't focus on the pepper, but on pretty much everything else. It is about medium hot with a strong vinegar tang."
1,DON'T BUY FROM THESE CROOKED SELLERS!,"Bought an electric guitar from this seller. There were problems from day one. I e-mailed the seller about the problems, got a response asking me for details, I sent details, but suddenly, after 30 days passed, they stopped responding to my e-mails. I continued to send e-mails, I called, nothing. Now, just two months later the guitar is totally broken and doesn't play at all. My son is totally crushed. Austin Bazaar doesn't stand by their products, and Amazon doesn't stand by their partners. SAVE YOUR MONEY. DON'T BUY A HUNK OF JUNK FROM THESE CROOKED SELLERS."
1,"Horrible bunch of splinters...awful guitar, great wall display, pups fell out in 5 weeks!","Screws stripped out of wood anchors on both p-bass half pups! I week out of 30 day return. I have purchased over 200 guitars for my shop, and this Austin Bazaar trash wood Chinese termite food in Zebra is the worst i've EVER encountered. This was a Christmas gift sent right to the relation. With all the holiday hub bub, the 30 day return ran out as my 14 year old Nephew did not tell me until Valentines Day!Forewood. My nephew brought back, firewood. Terrible , terrible, terrible, excuse for a wall hanging. I'm still upset as all my other purchases, ( hundreds ) that this hunk of junk made it to the listings here.Pretty obvious recommendation--------steer clear of this pile of panda droppings!STAYYYYYYY-------AWAYYYYYYYYYYYY!BOOOOOOOO------HISSSSSSSSSSSSSS!NO, NO, NO!THEIR BADDDDDDD!"
1,Don't Waste your Money,"I bought this bass guitar as a starter for my son based on the good reviews I read. The neck is entirely warped and the amplifier was indented. That's how we received it. Unfortunately, my son broke his finger right when we bought this and he was unable to play it for a few weeks. By the time he took it to his teacher and the defects were identified, we were beyond the 30 day return period. The seller, Austin Bazaar, never returned my emails or request for a replacement. Amazon tried to help but was unable to convince the seller to replace it. You'd be much better off going to Guitar Center and buying a starter guitar there - at least you can see what you're getting. Don't waste your money on this guitar. The seller has atrocious customer service."
1,Broken parts may not get fixed...,"This guitar was given to my daughter,she loves anything zebra related. But doesn't really play.The guitar has always been gently used. The strap broke within two weeks and was quickly replaced by Austin Bazaar.Within two months the fretboard nut snapped in two and the emails began. I still have not heard a peep from Austin Bazaar. I started to pursue the issue with Amazon directly and this was not an easy process either. Kept getting back that I didn't email within 90 days of purchase which is NOT the truth. FINALLY after some direct phone calls Amazon has offered to reimburse up to a certain amount for the repair.When we got an estimate today on fixing the nut at a local guitar shop they quoted us $50 to $60-. This was not as much as Amazon offered us. We'll see what happens...."
3,Smoky Bacon,"This bacon was really good and smoky. It was not great, though. I would shop around before ordering again."
5,A great feeling and playing ball that stays perfectly inflated months longer than our other premium balls,"Our ball never needed inflation... well past the first year that Spalding recommends. Once it did, we pulled the valve cover off (protip: to those reviewers who couldn't figure this out) then inserted the filler tip into the valve as usual and inflated it slightly. My only knock on this ball relates to the microfiber composite wear. My son used it daily, both on hardwood and on asphalt courts, and the tackiness wore off pretty quickly, turning it into a brushed feel, worn and slightly slippery ball. It's still a ball he brings to practice occasionally, and it's still properly inflated, but I bought a replacement ""court-only"" ball to replace the original feel. I felt a need to write a review as I'm about to buy another NeverFlat and I wanted to counteract the single star reviewer above..."
3,Decent basketball but kids always choose it last,The ball stays inflated fine as described. It definitely has a different feel than a regular ball and the kids at practice tend to select it last over more traditional basketball designs.
1,ball goes flat,"Don't believe it, the ball does go flat. No way to inflate the ball because the valve is blocked. Don't waste your money."
3,A Love of The Artist For His Mother.,"Throughout the ages, poets and philosophers have extolled the virtues of womanhood and motherhood. Pablo Picasso is quoted: ""My mother said to me, 'If you become a soldier you'll be a general; if you become a monk you'll end up as the pope.' Instead, I became a painter and wound up as Picasso."
1,not good,"I don't understand what all the fuss is about. I agree with the other reviewers here who found this lacking. Too much style, too little substance. Like imitation Graham Greene."
1,another vote for pretentious and imitative,"This isn't literary, it's ""literary."" Ciment writes with one eye on herself in the mirror as the great writer, and it shows in every sentence. The plot limps along and everything that happens is signalled a mile away. If you're surprised by anything, it's your own fortitude that you've kept reading."
1,over-written and self-conscious,"This is ultimately a question of personal taste, but I found this novel appallingly over-written and self-conscious. Yes, she has a decent story in mind, but the writing itself is just too distractingly over-wrought. Metaphors and similes pile up at an alarming rate on every page and the story moves along, but it's not as good as it could have been, if Ciment had a better grasp of her own strengthes and weaknesses. Her memoir is better writing and truer in every sense."
4,Enjoyable Time Travel Romance,"I did enjoy this book and agree with the other reviews. I read mostly regency-era historical romance, so I must say I think at times what it would be like to be transported to that time period. I liked all the characters and felt they were well developed. Liked the ending, it was unexpected. I agree that Maggie uses too much slang and it did not seem natural. It was almost like the character made too much emphasis on the speech differences and it made you think that Maggie could have blended in better if she even tried a little. Overall, it was a quick and enjoyable book."
4,Pretty good....,"This workout is slow, calm, and relaxing. You probably won't break a sweat or feel any real strain if you are already in moderate good shape. However, you will enjoy the tranquil poses and stretching. This is a good DVD for those looking for an intro to yoga."
3,Very relaxing but not much work out.,I really enjoyed this from a relaxation stand point but it was WAY too easy for me personally. I have not done a whole lot of yoga and I'm not in very good shape and this presented no challenge what so ever. This would be a very good starting point for someone who is very out of shape and has no experience at all with yoga (or for people who just need to relax)
4,Decent,"I'm not huge into Yoga, but I knew I needed to increase my flexibility, and since I'm a ""plus size"" I figured this would be perfect. It's not bad. I am grateful for the modifications offered for the non-flexible and that they recognize that bigger people don't always move like thinner people. For the absolute beginner, like myself, it's not too easy. I wouldn't imagine that anyone who is intermediate and above would get much out of this one."
5,WOW ! Finally something I can do!,I am so happy with this DVD. It is nice to see someone who understands the needs of larger people. I have knee problems and the video did not hurt me at all which is amazing. If you have wanted to try Yoga and were nervous about being forzed into a preztel go buy this product.
4,Excellent Introduction,"I have had a little experience with yoga tapes in the past. I have never used them beyond one or two times, because I found the postures difficult. Megan is a wonderful teacher and this tape-in combination with her wonderful book-MEGA YOGA, is a beautiful foundation for the plus-size and average size beginner. Her love and optimism shine through and act as a light of encouragement and strength."
5,Yoga: Just my size with Megan Garcia,I would highly recommend this to any woman or man that is larger. It is fantastic. I am very out of shape. The more I do this the better I feel. And my body does not hurt afterwards. So it makes you want to stick with it. My husband is also enjoying the workout. Good Luck to all!
2,A bit too simple,"The setting and the instructor one this dvd are quite nice, and the yoga program is very, very easy - almost too easy.As the workout section only presents six poses (mountain pose, warrior 1 & 2, 5-pointed-star/goddess,child pose & downward dog), I think this video is only for REALLY absolute beginners, even if you're on the larger side (like me :-). You do get some nice tips for modifying the poses, but personally I prefer the beginners video from Patricia Walden, especially because it's more back-friendly."
5,"Finally, something for big people.","I'd been searching for something to exercise to and came across Yoga: Just My Size. What an idea. Actually have something for large people, by a large person. I'd been so sick and tired of video's by females that didn't weight 100 pounds soaking wet. Exercising at a pace I couldn't possibly keep up with. I was looking for something that didn't rattle my bones. This was the answer. It's geared for large people, is easy to follow and will not jar you to pieces. Yoga is a gentle, slow paced stretching video that just works wonderfully for me. I can not do the Jane Fonda routines nor the Richard Simmons ""oldies"" routines, as much as I'd like to. I'm too large. This video is perfect."
4,Enjoyable,"This is a good product for light, body compatible Yoga. Be warned if you have trouble getting on your knees, it isn't for you. You do spend a good time down on the floor. The instructor is informative and easy to follow. I really enjoy this DVD."
4,This DVD is just what it says it is,"I am very pleased with this DVD. It is the only Yoga DVD that I have come across that is done by a woman of my size. I am a ""plus-sized"" woman who likes the concept of Yoga and was intimidated by most Yoga DVDs because of the ""size"" of the instructors - small and trim. I may be short, but I am not trim or skinny. Finally, with this DVD, I too can enjoy the benefits of Yoga and feel comfortable with the instructor, since Megan is about the same size I am. I recommend this DVD to anyone who is plus-sized and interested in the benefits of Yoga."
2,Ok... not for yoga enthusiasts...,"This DVD is pretty damn boring. It's too short and the meditation part SUCKS out loud. It also says that it gives alternate poses for those with bodies not quite up to yoga par, but you have to switch to a spceial mode in order to do this and remember it for when SHE does the plain old yoga w/out the modifications. I've only used it once and it did make my back feel better for the day, but I can't bring myself to use it again because it's so dumb. The five star pose is hard work, and that's good, but other than this all it is is stretching."
2,Not what I expected,"I am sure some people would find this DVD useful, but it wasn't at all what I expected. This may be attributed to my not being familiar with yoga, and have nothing to do with this particular DVD, but I wasn't even able to watch the entire thing."
3,A great beginning,"This was a really good introduction to yoga for bigger bodies. I had never really done yoga so it went slowly and explained things well (instead of trying to guess what subtle movements were happening on the screen). I had a few complaints.1. There were some details of the DVD that made me feel a little awkward about cultural appropriation- I don't want to do namaste or say ""Om"" or any of that, because I'm don't feel like I know enough about it to use it respectfully.2. The timing was a little strange because the DVD would instruct you to take 5 deep breaths. I would be on my third by the time they would move on. (So maybe they meant deep and fast, but that feels counterintuitive to yoga).But again, it's a good starting point, it is relaxing, it's a short routine so it can be easier to incorporate into your schedule, and there are great tips for folks that can't do certain movements because of weak joints or other physical ailments.:)"
5,Great for Beginners,"I purchased this DVD along with several others to help get myself back into shape. While I occasionally work through the other DVDs, this one is the one I return to time after time. The workout is definitely for beginners, and anyone with yoga experience will probably find it much too easy, but for those of us who have let our middles get a little too soft and haven't stepped foot in a gym in a few years, it's a great DVD. The exercises are soothing and invigorating, and Megan is a wonderful instructor. I recommend this DVD to any plus size women who want to take control of their bodies and do something good for themselves."
4,Great for yoga newbies,"If you have always wanted to try yoga but have felt too intimidated, this is a great DVD to start with. Megan is an excellent instructor, and anyone can do the workout. My only complaint is that she didn't spend any time explaining how to get into the various positions. That is the only reason I am giving this four stars instead of five."
2,Not for anyone with even a little yoga experience,I a real yoga neophyte (< 6 months 1 X weekly class) but I found this disk not at all challenging. I was hoping for something that would supplement the weekly class. This doesn't do it.
2,Not the best!,"I am a beginner, and started with ""Yoga for the Rest of Us"", the back care DVD. I thought I would be adding more good poses with this DVD, but was sorely dissapointed with the poor instructional quality. In my opinion, beginners are better served by the first series!"
2,Yoga...not for the rest of us,"While Garcia looks like the rest of us, she's a lot more flexible. If you have knee or wrist problems, you probably should stay away from this video. When I finished the video I felt more frustrated than anything. I've resorted to doing yoga moves without a video because there aren't a whole lot of videos catering to those of us who are somewhat familiar with yoga, out of shape, and in need of modifications so we don't hurt ourselves."
4,great for beginners,"I bought this DVD after reading about it in the WEight watchers magazine out this month. Megan is a friendly, really knowledgeable instructor. The DVD goes through warmups and poses and breaks them down into easy steps. It was a good pace for me - no longer young, no longer skinny :) and I think I can stick with it. I started a walking routine and will be adding this yoga tape after my walks to stay flexible and build strength. I hope Megan does more fitness tapes soon."
3,Good Beginners Yoga DVD,"This yoga DVD is a good program for those just beginning yoga, no matter the person's size or weight.It shows basic breathing exercises, poses, transitions into the poses it uses, and a few ways to modify a pose or two.For those persons looking for more yoga instruction or more advance yoga work, I recommend looking into the Gaiam yoga series with Suzanne Deason."
3,trapped in silence,This is a strange movie but you do get involved in it and wonder what is going to happen next. I would recommend this movie but i do not like some of the explicit graphics..Anyway i can say without giving the story away i did like the ending..
3,a mixed bag of goodies from the great Daphne Du Maurier,"Daphne Du Maurier is one of my favorite authors. Her prose is always elegant. Unfortunately her shorter novels have a tendency to clash with her style; characterizations are not well-developed, the outcome somewhat forced. This is generally true also with this collection of short novels written by Du Maurier late in her career. ""Don't Look Now"" and ""Not After Midnight"" are the better of the bunch, but none are enthralling ... certainly not when compared to her best short novel ""The Birds"" (yes, the story from which the film is loosely based on).Bottom line: go for the author's novels (eg, ""The Scapegoat"" or ""Rebecca"") instead of these stories. Still, this book is overall a satisfactory read."
4,Good stuff for Whigs fans,The alternate versions of 'I Keep Coming Back' and 'Tonight' make it a good purchase.CD #11 Debonair2 My Curse3 Little Girl Blue4 ReadyCD #21 Debonair2 Rot (Marcy Mays / Scrawl song)3 I Keep Coming Back (alternate)4 Tonight (alternate)
3,Electronic Folk Music,"I originally gave this album 5 stars but I felt that might be misleading. Although this album has a place for a specific mood, it's appeal is somewhat limited. What's more, on a third listening, the feeling I described in my original review is a bit inconsistant from track to track.Original review follows:Chill-out electronica folk music, California Dreamin' has the flavor of the Sixties without leaving the 21st century. This album is a great soundtrack to anytime you're alone and melancholy, like driving in the rain, looking at old photographs or floating in a pool (think Dustin Hoffman in 'The Graduate'). This is an amazingly well put together album of various artists, each piece flowing nicely to the next. Having nothing noticable to do with California but a lot, perhaps, to do with dreamin', this album is a five star selection only if you're in the mood for it. Lazy and wistful, it won't perk you up but it will compliment the times you feel reflective or dreamy."
1,STINKER!,"What a waste of money. Even my 11 year old hockey player hated it. The story line is really bad and the acting is worse. I thought it would be a fun, cleaned-up version of Slap Shot, since we won't let him watch that yet, but at least on par with Slap Shot. It should be called ""Slap Me Silly if I Buy This."""
1,Slap Shot 3!,"They should of stuck with the Original 1,This 1 was worse than the 2nd,Waste of time evev the Hanson Brothers could not make thios movie funny,Stinks!!"
5,Pretty good Hockey Movie,"Was surprised to see that there was a Slapshot 3 when I saw this at Walmart, I liked the original, the 2nd one was so so,but this one actually turned out to be a pretty good movie and I would most certainly recommend it- especially if you like hockey."
3,"Not bad, but not great either","I won't as dour a rating as the previous reviewer, but I won't give it a good one either. A Slap Shot followup rated 'PG'? Come on, you can do better than that!On the other hand, there were several ""repeat gags"" that were apparantly tributes to the original in a setting that is a little more presentable for kids.Being a former hockey player myself I can attest that minor league hockey life was very much what the original Slap Shot portrayed, and that's not something I'd expose young kids to; Slap Shot 3 is for the parents who grew up with the original and want to give their kids something in the spirit of the original and don't want to have to stoop to giving their kids 'Mighty Ducks' films (don't get me wrong, this film is only a notch or two above 'Ducks' films, but undoubtably better)."
5,HH187,"I've owned my 187 for over 2 years and have nothing but good things to say about it. Unless you plan to work with aluminum and would later need to invest in the gun/controller I would say this is just about the most any home would need. It will weld 1/4"" all day long on a 30 amp breaker without breaking a sweat. My #3 bottle of c25 is still 3/4 full after many projects running at 15-30cfh....though mostly small volume projects."
3,Mellow ballad sessions by legendary sax master,"Recorded in June 1950 and April 1952 in Paris, and, as the title might lead you to believe, these sessions find Byas soloing melodically on mid-tempo ballads. With only one upbeat blues jam, the set list is on the mellow side. There's little display of the advanced swing stylings that he's most well-known for, though it's a subtly pleasant listen.Don Byas Sax (Tenor)Art Simmons PianoMaurice Vander PianoJean-Pierre Sasson GuitarJoe Benjamin Double BassRoger Grasset Double BassBenny Bennett DrumsBill Clark Drums"
3,"The last Faces ""Live"".","It is not a good live recording, and does not have a very good sound, but Keith is here. We can hear the ""duets"" between the future partners Keith and Ronnie."
3,"Weak after last volume's mayhem, but check it out.","Well, Goku says goodbye in this volume, as due to fighting Majinn Buu in his SSJ3 form during the previous one, his time on Earth has been spent. Although these episodes feel a bit slow-pace after ""Defiance,"" they're still worth checking out, since the scene with Goku's goodbye is done pretty well. Also, the previous volume features Buu encountering a blind kid(voiced by Hayashibara Megumi!) and winds up helping the kid up when his attempt to make the kid fear him backfires. A little WAFFy, but nice, although I would like it to get on with the main story as soon as possible. Although this one isn't must-buy like some of the other DVDs in the Buu saga, fans should check it out if they have the time."
4,Diving DOM,"Beautiful photos but too heavy to use as a field guide, which was what I was looking for, so I returned it. I would recommend it if you're looking for a coffee table book."
1,Beneath Clouds,i did not care for this it seem to move to slowly - did not watch any more not reccomend
2,Subtitle is inappropriate,"Based on the subtitle of the book, one might expect this to be a history of the Rajneeshees and their eventual establishment of a large community in Oregon. Instead, this book is basically an autobiography of a former Rajneeshee, who does touch on some of the more infamous actions by the Rajneeshees. There is precious little detail on the salmonella poisonings in The Dalles, the political posturing in Antelope and other parts of the state, or even the anti-Rajneeshee actions such as the bombing of the Zorba the Buddha restaurant. Good for those who want to read an autobiography of someone who was in the movement, but hardly a tome about ""the rise and fall of Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh."""
3,Talk about damning with faint praise...,"One of the reviewers stated of the Orthodox Church: ""...the church that is still a driving force in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Russia, Ukraine, Serbia, Ethiopia and Albania."" That reminds me of what the old Canadian humorist Stephen Leacock said about the classics professor who claimed Thucydides was responsible for ""everything I am today."" Said Leacock--""this is a serious charge, indeed."""
2,"Certainly no ""Farewell My Concubine""","This movie moves incredibly slow. For example, instead of showing one second of pool and then going into dialogue between the pool players, they show a whole game of pool with no dialogue besides ""Good move!"" At one point, they film the outside of a bathroom for an entire minute: no dialogue, no actors, nothing. The thing to which Western gay male and lesbian viewers may relate is the heterosexism and compulsory heterosexuality. Straight characters frequently ask the gay main character if he has a girlfriend without once thinking that maybe he doesn't want one. They try to matchmake him with women, as if all men are attracted to women. I just cannot imagine anybody besides Sinologists enjoying this film."
1,Poorly printed,I returned this book because the print on many pages was blurred making them unreadable. I think this is unacceptable in a paperback at this price.
2,200 hundred pages without a single captivating paragraph,"Brazil have certainly produced fantastic writers, but I fail to miss to point of this book or what the author wanted to convey. The drama feels artifical and the ""humor"" can only be described as lame.If the reader is looking for some type of description of the XIX century customs and ambiance of the brazilian lifestyle, he/she will also end up being very dissapointed since the atmosphere only provides with bits and pieces, which are the barely minimum to locate the reader in the space and time of the novel.Frankly your money will be spended better in other book."
3,zebra lounge,"when i purchased this movie i thought the story would be interesting to see,the idea of the movie is good,but with a subject like this and in the beginning it says strong sexual scenes,theres no sex,the little there is is with clothes on ,some horrible acting from stephen baldwin,the other actors were ok,still woth a look"
4,KRISTY RULES,"Okay,you know this wasn't an award winning movie. I wont bore you with that and the whole plot...you can see that stuff here from the others. But i will mention that Kristy Swanson is very hot and spicy in this movie. Kristy is wicked in this movie. Kristy uses some 'provocative' language in this movie. Kristy is engaged in sensual kissing with another female in this movie.Now you have all you need to know to rent or buy this movie."
4,Beware,We enjoyed this movie. But beware of the life-style of this movie. The ending will tell it all.
3,"If you play with fire, then don't complaint yourself in case you burn!","The influence of Attraction Fatal around this script is much more than obvious. The erotic atmosphere, the sensuality and senses` delight is convincingly expressed and sumptuously suggested.The main problem has to do with this weak script that simply cannot escape fro the anecdotic archetype and makes of the empire of the senses a warning advise. There were so many roads to explore about it; but..."
2,Ho-Hum Canadian Thriller,"Kari Skogland, who previously directed the throw-away Nazi teen drama ""White Lies"" with Sarah Polley, directed ""Zebra Lounge,"" an unsuccessful, run-of-the-mill take on ""Fatal Attraction."" A married couple post an ad in a swinger sex column to rekindle the dying flame of their marital sex life, getting response from hundreds of people, including two seemingly-normal pyschotics (Kristy Swanson and Stephen Baldwin). The film starts off as a look into the life of a failing marriage, turning into a boring, predictably unambitious thriller. Canadian cinema has seen better days."
4,Good Job,"Yeah, I ordered two books at the same time, one from amazon and one from this seller. This seller provided the best service. While Amazon's order was delayed and frought with difficulty the transaction with this seller was quick and efficient."
3,"He didn't exactly go out on a limb, did he?","Hmmmm....it appears that BW's fave BB's songs are exactly the same as his record companies fave BB's songs. Which begs a few questions: 1. Why does this piece of product exist? 2. Where's ""Let Him Run Wild""? 3. Why did I even bother writing this review?"
3,Why another greatest hits package?,"All of the hardcore fans, have numerous copies of all of these songs, why did Brian try to suck another $.. from his fans in order to sell one more 'new' song - and its not even new. Why did he make a new version of the song with the Wondermints and put it on a BEACH BOYS CD? Why didn't he release the Beach Boys version - which most fans have bootleg copies?"
2,"Unexcited, hazy presentation; at least accurate & coherent","Despite the myriad typos and mostly confused presentation, this book has at least couple of redeeming virtues, namely that a few sections, like the point-set topology section, were decent; in general the proofs were mostly rigorous and solid; and the exercises listed many good problems to help our understanding. Most important, the integreation of linear algebra with the calculus/analysis was, as advertised, pretty good. But the text was unexciting and very often completely unhelpful. It gets the job done of presenting the material, but not very well."
3,"Maybe should have been titled, ""How to use common sense""?","This book is pretty good and would definitely be useful for people who misplace things. But unfortunately most of the principles are already known to everybody and mostly common sense usage. The book does bring in a good sense of humor, but also extends its welcome by about 30 pages by stories which could have been kept out..."
5,Evolution,"This is a great Cd that I only recently (year or so ago) took the time to listen to. Squirrel Bait was awesome, don't get me wrong, but I'm tired of people being upset when an artist develops. I'm not really a fan of his newer work, nut Starbilly was awesome. Dark, popapunk, fun to listen to, but deep enough to stick with you. It has some more polish on it and it's a good thing. I'm not going to get rid of my squirrel bait albums, but this is a great progression from a talented man. If I didn't evolve, I'd still be sitting in my parents house listening to Anthrax. :)"
2,It won't catch any squirrels.,"Peter Searcy, all grown up following his stint years back as the frontman(boy?) for the magnificent post-punk teen wunderkinds Squirrel Bait, and that's too bad. He's cleaned up some of his wail, and has apparently excised a large amount of the angst he had in the 80's. Nevertheless, for those wishing there was more Bait out there, this is it. Starbilly is pop, but not to the saccharin extent of Searcy's recent solo effort (watch some late night VH-1 to catch remnants). Send me back to Skag Heaven."
4,Cheesy but addictive to children,"These videos have the smarmy, low budget feel, but what do you expect for the price. My son cannot get enough of the train and monster truck videos as well as the others. If you need some quiet time while your 3 year old boy is totally entertained, this is a very good and inexpensive way to go."
3,Speedo,I bought this CD for the first song on it (Speedo). I don't care too much for the rest of the tunes on it but for me it was well worth the money just for the one song. The CD was dirt cheap and if you like very old Rock and Roll. This one hit wonder is a must have.
2,Not impressed,I recently bought this video along with The Firm Super Body Sculpting. I agree with one person that she zooms through the workout like you know what you are doing. The music on this video is all wrong. I will make an attempt to do the work out but won't make any promises. I can see the difference in these older and newer firm videos. The music is up to date and you don't have a ton of people excercising at the same time. They don't give you a modification of each exercise.
4,Great for Beginner to Intermediate! Tracie Long is great!,"Great for Beginner to Intermediate! Lunges, lunges, lunges, lunges..... oh and they do a very short cardio segment and then..... But at 45 min you can do this tape twice a day! Only complaints are to many lunges (oh, my knees), and too short of a cardio segment. The music is very good, atmosphire is good BUT the best thing is the instructor, Tracie Long, she is the best that I have seen!!!"
2,Not for Beginners!!,"The description of the video states that it is for beginners to intermediate...use only if you are planning to enter the Olympics. Do not even consider this if you are a beginner. Tracie Long is supposed to be the instructor on this video, she is rather a demonstrator only. The tape has no introduction or instruction whatsoever and Tracie zooms right through each excercise as if the viewers were totally familiar with all movements of the routines. If you are looking for a step by step or even minor support, this video is not for you...I was most overwhelmed and discouraged."
1,Aerobic work out isn't there,"I was very disappointed, when it said 30 minutes of aerobic I was expecting a cardio work out to get my heart rate up, it wasn't there. I have ordered Gilad, Kathy Smith, Tamilee Webb, Kelly Roberts and have been VERY pleased with all of those but NOT with this one. I was expecting a cardio work out mixed with weights. In this work out it jumps around too much, picking up different weights, body bar, push ups, after I finished I had to jump on the treadmill for 20 minutes just to get a cardio work out. Also, it doesn't use a normal 'step' I had to add risers (making the Reebok bench 4 risers high) and still didn't get the cardio."
4,Great toning video,"This is the first time I have done The Firm and have bought a video specifically for sculpting. I LOVE it! However, I would like a video of this caliber (sculpting) with more cardio. Although my heart rate does increase and I feel a difference in my body - - I would like higher intensity. I think it would shape a bit better with an additional 15 minutes of aerobic activity (the tape is only 45 minutes)."
4,"Silvestri, fabulous from feather to finish","Alan Silvestri's SCORE for Forrest Gump is a classic. Movie music lovers all over the world surely will recognize the theme filtering through the first seconds of the movie, accompanying a feather carried in the wind. Don't be fooled: the other 20 tracks on this cd wil carry YOU back to that very first time you saw this picture, and - if you're old enough - to that time in American history. From 'run Forrest run' and 'Washington reunion' to 'Forrest meest Forrest' and 'Jenny's grave', it's Silvestri's way to tell a story. From subtle piano to majestic symphony variations: his orchestrations are magnificent.Enjoy.NB. Besides this SCORE there's also a double cd, titled 'Forrest Gump the soundtrack'. It contains 33 hits from this era (from Elvis Presley to Bob Seger) plus about 8 minutes of Silvestri's score."
5,Life is like a box of chocolates....,"Thescore for Gump is a sweeping instrumental score with inspiring woodwinds, synth. and piano. The ONLY downfall is the Jeasus on the main line song...it just does not fit in there what-so-ever. But still, the score is 100% a keeper!"
5,a walk through the later part of the twentieth century,"This CD is great for people that like American History. It includes songs from the 50s(Hounddog), 60s(Sloop John B), and 70s(Sweet Home Alabama)."
5,The Best Movie Score of the '90s,"If you enjoyed the ""Forrest Gump Suite"" on the double cd soundtrack you will love this release. This release contains the orchestral score that complements every scene from Forrest Gump. It is a very moving and powerful soundtrack that adds so much feeling to certain scenes, especially ""You Can't Sit Here"" and the recurring ""Jenny"" themes. The only track that doesn't belong here is ""Jesus on the Main Line,"" the only original vocal track written for the movie. That should have been released on the previous compilation. You get a good 40 minutes of peaceful music in this package, perfect to put on at work or at home for stress relief. Fully orchestrated and thoughtfully arranged for such a wonderful movie. Buy it!"
1,"I thought it would be all the 60s and 70s music from the movie. Instead, it's all some classical, easy listening. wasteful!","I thought I was getting the music of the 60s and 70s from the movie. Instead I received the classical musical soundtrack. Very disappointing and a waste of my money, at least."
5,"So emotive, it brings tears to your eyes :)","This is one of those rare soundtracks that can bring someone like me, a 18 year old teen to tears in some parts of the score. I believe this to be silvestri's best work since his Back to The future Series . You can really always tell a good soundtrack, by its ability to be heard over and over again and to still move you in new ways. Like when jennifer is a little girl and prays to god to be made into a bird to hide from her father with forest in the fields is just so beautiful, you will feel so tingly and tearful all of a sudden!What a triumph! Anyone who loves this film is in for a real treat and even those who dont will be able to admire silvestris emense talent to capture human emotion in such an artistic and warming manner :) Silvestri you have done it again mate :)"
1,Most of these reviews are NOT for the cd shown above,"Most of these reviews are NOT for the Silvestri cd shown above. Instead, most of these reviews are for the cd that contains a collection of thirty-two songs by various artists. The Silvestri cd contains mostly instrumental selections."
3,Nice heater but way too bright,"I have an old Presto Quartz heater similar to this one and it has a nice strong orange glow. This one is lower wattage but gives off much more of a bright, sunlight color. A message to hyundai home improvement was not returned. Appears to be nicely made for the price and good for someone with SAD. It might be good for a chicken incubator also."
1,...,"While I'm sure that many of the ""facts"" presented in this book are correct, the obvious errors make it incredibly difficult to trust anything Rowan says. On page 163 he begins to tell how each month relates to the tree. But Celtic astrology definately does not work in this way. Each month does not correspond to a specific letter of the ogham, nor to a tree. After all, you can't say that if you're born in September, you're a virgo. it doesn't work that way, and Rowan, as a bard or druid, should understand this. it leaves the reader questioning what other ""facts"" he has made up."
5,One of the best True Crime Books I've ever read,"I feel the best thing you can say to an authur of a true crime book(or any book) is that you couldn't put it down.Unbelieveable, meticulous reaserch.You will read this book late into the night and you will bring it to work the next day and read it when you boss isn't looking.There's only one problem with a book as good as this....it has to end.Bravo..Maury Terry!"
4,Math Art,Very fun. Lots of good activities. I recommend it for alternative enrichment activities for kinesthetic learners. I have already used several ideas with great success.
2,for teachers,I bought this for my daughter but it is really meant for a teacher. I thought it would have cool math related art projects but it really didnt.
5,Craft Mania,"A very interesting and good book for all those like my wife who like doing various crafts. Monies worth and very reliable,efficiant service from amazon."
1,Do not choose if you are looking to make high fashion bags,I totally disliked this book...if you want to make craft show type stuff then perhaps this is a good choice but I came lloking for info on how to make high fashion high quality beaded handbags likened to some of todays top designers and thisbag did not even stracth the surface of what I needed. I would only suggest this book for those looking to make little trinkets in thier spare time certainly not for resale.
4,Beaded Purses,The layout of the book was easy to follow. So were the instructions. The colors used in the purses were too muted in some. Therefore a person using the author's color schemes will find that some of the purses look washed out when they bead them.
5,Commentary and reprints of vintage comic books.,"Includes color reprint of vintage comic books (Superman, from Action Comics No. 1 (1938); The Bat-Man from Detective Comics No. 29 (1939). Also Scribbly, Plastic Man and Jack Cole; Captain Marvel and C.C. Beck; Dr. Dimwit, Powerhouse Pepper from Tessie the Typist (1947); Little Lulu Donald Duck, Pogo, The Spirit etc."
5,Exellent! One of a kind! Exiting,"I love comic books and books about comic books. I have a collection of comic books in my room in a box. I have alot of iron man comics. I have some fantastic four comics too. My favorite comics and superheroes are Plastic Man, the Fantastic Four, and Iron Man. I love the Smithsonian Book of comic-book comics!"
5,I can sleep at night!!,"I had no idea how much my wrist was preventing me from sleeping. Furthermore, I didn't realize my left wrist was hurting until I started wearing the brace on my right wrist. Amazing, now I just need one for my left wrist."
3,Not worth the money.,This item is just ok. It provides limited range of motion for your fingers and yet the support is somewhat weak.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,The brace is too large and does not breath even though the advertising leads you to believe that it does. Try a smaller one. Futuro has smaller braces that are better.
3,wrist support,Vary comfy and soft but its more a hand support then wrist. I tore a muscle in my wrist because the doctors cant cast it they have told me to wear a support but i wanted to softer one to wear to sleep. I loved this one when i tryed it on but it doesnt support the left side of your wrist and it will acctully hurt it more im still going to keep this though because its so soft and nice im just going to have to wait till i can move my wrist more and dont need as much support.
