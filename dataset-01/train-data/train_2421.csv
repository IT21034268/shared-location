3,Beware of the Vidmark VHS release,"The movie itself is great, but it seems the Vidmark release of this movie is fatally flawed. I've bought THREE copies of this VHS tape over the years looking to upgrade from what I already have, but each time the tape rolls to blue screen and acts horrble in the multiple VCR's I have tried them in--regardless of ""supposed"" condition.If you can put off a down payment on a car, pick up the SEVERELY overpriced OOP DVD release or the equally overpriced Anchor Bay VHS release instead. So please, if you enjoy spending money for a specific reason, DO NOT buy the VIDMARK VHS release!"
5,Overlooked Gem from the 80's...,"This film, made for television in the mid-80,s; is a lot of nostalgic fun.Great performances; make-up and a lot of laughs (plus Wolfman Jack) make it a must see.The downside - the DVD is long out of print and waaaay too expensive. Well - we paid for ours; and are glad we did - but it hurt the pocketbook at the time."
1,Seriously?,Ok this review isn't about the movie its about the ridiculous prices these sellers are charging. It makes me sick how these people take advantage about how hard it is to find this title. If anybody reading this has actually paid 129.00 which I see is the lowest price to 250.00 the highest price I would be surprised. I remember seeing this 12 years ago in a bargain bin for 7.99. I'm all for making money on hard to find collectibles but at least be reasonable. My hope is that the studios re-release this so people can enjoy it without spending their rent money. Once that happens I will take this down and write a real review. Rant over.
4,"""Blast from the Past""","Hey everybody! If you like Halloween movies, this is one you have to see. A classic ""blast from the past""!Christy G."
1,Hackneyed,"I saw a bad copy taped off TV once. Oh my, what junk it was. The basic story is: a couple of high school students (notice in all horror movies the main characters are never older than 20) find this cursed...I dunno, thing and that just sets off zombies to rise from their graves and run amok during Halloween. Hmm, how convenient. Basically everyone becomes a zombie except for one kid who tries to, like, ""uncurse"" it. It's forgettable if you're a die hard horror fan, actually even if you're not it's forgettable. Although I imagine it must have been a hassle to make Kevin McCarthy look scarier than he is in real life. See ""Dawn of the Dead"" instead if you want horror, or ""Return of the Living Dead"" if you want horror comedy."
1,The movie is GREAT but the PRICE is WRONG,"I think the movie was a great movie but your price is outragous.If you go to F.Y.E. you can get the same D.V.D. for $27.00 After taxes and shipping. Seems like alot better deal,Dont you think?"
3,Too brief...,"Those of you who want to learn about guinea pigs and how to care for them in detail, I'm afraid that this book is not suitable for you. The contents are too brief. Despite that, the pictures are very clear (and there are lots of them!) I feel that this book will be perfect for young children who are learning to care for their cavies as the language is simple to understand."
5,Fabulous buy!!!,Great book for creating learning centers for all the teachers I work with! It is so easy to use and the activities are quickly completed! Love it!!!
2,not satisfied,"I'm not satisfied with the quality of papers. If it's just for practicing words or reading, it's ok. But this is kind of a game. It's not fun to play game with it!"
1,Not tasty at all,This product tasted like a watered down chocolate baby food product. I purchased it for dipping when I needed a chocolate fix did not live up to half of my expectation.
3,Sour aftertaste,"I think this actually has a chocolate flavor, like cocoa. But...the sour aftertaste is not appetizing. Same thing with the caramel sauce and other items. I've been on Ideal Protein program and found that mixing this with the chocolate shake, which has a little milk protein in it, dulls that sour aftertaste. I've made popsicles that way. If you can have milk, try that. It may help. Better than no chocolate at all..."
1,Horrible! Stay away... I like some of the salad dressings they make,so I figured I'd try this chocolate dip. The reviewer who described it as a horrible chemical taste was right on. It is awful beyond words. I am sorry I ever put that stuff in my mouth! Threw it out right away.
1,YUK!,"Every Walden Farms calorie-free product I tried was terrible, including this one. It's not just that it's not as good as ""the real thing,"" but it is truly AWFUL! Don't waste your money."
1,taste like chemicals..,I thought after trying the gross peanut butter..that this cant be much worse ...and what do ya know?? it was just a bad. It went straight in the garbage! dont wast your money!!
1,"Wretched stuff, tastes like something from a chem lab","I had been looking for a low carb chocolate sauce for dipping fruit but was under no illusion that a no calorie chocolate sauce would be as good as a homemade ganache. I decided to keep an open mind.I wish I hadn't. This was the most disgusting stuff known to mankind. It actually took me back to high school chemistry lab when we created the fake banana scent out of something that smelled like sweaty feet and baby vomit (butyric acid). The previous reviewer mentioned a chemical taste and this is it. It tastes like it was manufactured in a lab, which it very likely is.Next time I will take the time, chocolate, stevia and cream and make my own. At least I know what I am eating and it will really taste like chocolate."
5,"Not quite your typical full flavored chocolate, but great for cravings","I have to watch my sugar (PCOS and insulin resistance), and I have a bad sweet tooth. I read bad reviews of this product, so I had to write my own. I just tried it frozen on strawberries and thought it was wonderful.. No aftertaste, not too strong (sadly), but a great way to treat myself to something that tastes sinful. I did not try this by itself, and I dipped half bananas in it and placed them on corn on the cob holders and put them in the freezer to try later, so I can't wait to see how they turned out.. But if you have to limit sugar or are cutting calories this is great. I can't imagine the bad reviews because I wouldn't dare drink a diet coke (I got used to coke zero and diet dr pepper, but REFUSE diet coke because it tastes like poison to me). So give it a shot on strawberries at least, and hopefully it will be great on other things, too. :)"
1,horrendous!,"This stuff is horrendous. It honestly almost made me vomit when I tried it :( I was so excited to buy it in hopes it would curb my chocolate cravings while dieting. uuugghh, just horrible!! Guess I'll stick to sneaking a spoonful of nutella here and there instead"
1,don't waste your money...,"I bought this and figured ""hey nothing but $4 to lose."" and it is not even worth that. I opened it and it looked like chocolate cake batter and figured ok, nice. At first taste i was like, ""not horrible... oh, there it is."" It has a horrible after taste that makes me think of random chemicals. Don't buy this."
2,a Dissapointment,"I was looking for something to calibrate my home theater, and it this sort of does it, but there are much better discs out there. I expected more from Manheim Steamroller."
4,A rehablitation of American values written by an European,"One of the most difficult themes: Americans in Europe, Europe in America. Very daring literary form of ""vignettes"" and some socratic dialogue. It is a success.Professionally the facts and conslusions are what they should be, the author being a Yale professor.This fro the point of view of an Northern European historian."
1,No lo recomendo,"A no ser de una de esas personas que les gusta tener un disco por UNA SOLA CANCIÓN, algo así como la Macarena, este cd es realmente para el olvido y a pesar que respeto y me encanta la diversidad de gustos, las personas que calificaron este disco con una nota superior a tres estrellas......Por favor!!, escuchen otras cosas ya que la buena música es cultura y este intento de cd dista mucho de estar en esa categoría."
4,NOT POP BUT GOOD,"I do not know what this other guy is talking about but this cd is not europop. It is more like flamenco and it is entirely in spanish and there are dance songs on it. It is more like spanish pop then europop. If you are buying it expecting to get more songs like the main song which is the best do not. The good thing is that you could consider it like a single. It has the spanish, karaoke, and hippi versions of the song. But overall you can open your mind to a new type of music. If you want the radio Spanglish version look at the american issued album with the red and yellow cover. I met them on Columbus Day Parade here in New York and they wee very snotty and rude and stuck up."
4,Visol Shark,"For many years I was happy using Windmill lighters even though I had to keep sending them back under warranty. When Windmill changed their warranty and started a ""service charge"" that likely covers their cost of a new lighter, I switched to the Visol Shark a few weeks ago.I'm not really sure what the other reviewer meant when they mentioned burning their hand. The ergonomics work fine for me. I'm also a little sketchy about the comment about checking the fluid level. If you remove the bottom screw so that you can see the reservoir, the reservoir is opaque white plastic that you will need to hold in front of a very bright light in order to see whether or not it is full.Pluses: solid feel, strong flame, reasonably windproof, good capacity, lights first time, very hot, nice style.Minuses: no way to check fluid level, flat black finish is showing wear on the bottom, chrome flame cover shows some scratching."
3,Great Ideas To Copy,"Full of great designs to copy - I have made at least 3 already - but the instructions are a bit disjointed so you keep having to go back over them to find out what your supposed to do next and the images are only semi-helpful. Shows a great photo of the end product but not really how to get there.I have been decorating for years and most my cakes turn out sort of like the picture but not exactly. The icing colours, the modelling and the covering - you really need to have some sort of skill or decorating experience to achieve these designs."
3,"Great ideas, but missing details","Debbie is very talented and she's got some great ideas for cakes. However, Debbie has a tendency to keep to herself important parts of the assembly and skip some phases. You can use your imagination and talent to fill in the blanks, but it will not come out exactly like the picture.It's like getting a magician's book that shows you the tricks, but doesn't teach you how to perform them."
5,cutest cakes,This book has tons of great ideas for cakes. I loved how detailed it was in showing how everything was done.
1,Radical,"Be careful, the copy sent to me was in either Spanish or Portuguese--neither of which can I read. So my star rating is irrelevant."
4,+1/2,This is more like it. Too many blues people are going the way of the dinosaurs. Michael once again gives me hope that there are true blues artists out there. If you have been happy with his other albums then you have to get this one. It rocks your soul down to your last blues.
2,Target audience too wide,Love the concept of getting mom/dad and baby interacting! The age range is too broad though and needs to target one age/developmental bracket. Suggest you look at Bright Bubs instead which has age appropriate activites for each baby phase.
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"The professional reviews on this video are good, but I was very disappointed in the video. The moms are too enthusiastic to be real, the potted plant character is incredibly annoying and the video tries to do too many things for too many age-ranges to be successful at anything. Buy a Sesame Street or Wiggles video instead!"
4,A terrific late-nineties bay area comp,A terrific late-nineties bay area comp featuring mostly exclusive tracks. I certainly recommend this along with 2 other Swerve Compilations released around the same time:Spread Yo Hustleand3 Beam Circus.
3,great,this stuff is the best thing that i have taken and with a workout regiment it works wonders i have no complaints on the product.
5,Energy for days...i love this product,"I will take one or two of these 20-30 mins before I go for a run or the gym. I even took it once one evening when I was drug out by my friends to go dancing. We stayed out late so it helped keep me moving and awake :) I would never suggest you take this stuff before bed. It won't let you sleep, unless that isn't your intentions ;P I enjoy the burst of energy that is sustaining for longer than 20 minutes. The crash is barely there if you don't take too much. My appetite was extremely suppressed as well, so I had to be mindful of that as well as my water intake (I live in the desert). Overall great product, I have bought more than once and have used for some time now. Worth a try if have a busy schedule, a job where it requires focus, or just a boost to your exercise regimen."
2,Didn't help me lose any weight.,"I am still using it and exercising and trying to eat better. so far, I can't say this is helping in anyway."
2,ok but severe crash/fatigue at eveninig,"I have been using and testing various diet pills mostly for placebo and mental effect. After taking this pill in the morning before breakfast and then one around 2pm before lunch, I noticed a severe tiredness and crash around 5pm. This pattern continued for about a week till I decided to use my mathematical mind and find out what changed in my diet during that week.The main culprit I could point to was this pill. I stopped using the pill and now I am back to normal. I am back to using RoxyLean which is one of the best pills out there. Just remember that body to body is different so whatever you are taking , pay close attention to body, tiredness, fatigue and your moods till you find the right one. I typically don't like leaving negative reviews but this pills barely got a 2 out of 5 from me. The pills that have worked for me really well are RoxyLean, OxyElite, SubQ and LeanExtreme. Best of luck to all."
2,Nothing Special,"Gave me a little bit of energy for a couple weeks, after that I couldnt feel any difference at all between taking them and not taking them, except chronic headaches a few hours after. Might work for people trying to suppress appetite, not sure, but for energy I would keep looking."
5,A GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!,I work out all the time this product always give me the energy that i need!!!!!!!!!
2,Didn't work for me,"I was very anxious to try this product after reading all the reviews. I've never left a review before, but figured I should with this product. I bought the pills mainly for an energy boost. Once my pills came, I couldn't wait to try them out. So that morning I took 2 on an empty stomach, thinking that they would give me some energy. Well they didn't,in about 2 hours I was very drained and fatigued. So I figured maybe because I didn't get much sleep the night before, that was the reason the pills didn't work. Over several weeks I continued to use them hoping that once they got into my bloodstream I would see results. Well it never happened. I finally had to face the fact, that these pills just didn't work for me, like they did for everyone else. So now I'm back to the drawing board on finding some type of energy booster for myself. If you decided to try this product, I hope your results are better than mine."
3,Decent.,"This Wolverine is much more posable than some of the other figures, plus it comes with a motorcycle. The figure doesn't really fit on the bike well though, and that was disappointing. I'm really pleased with the jacket he comes with. He can move in it, and it isn't a bulky fabric coat, either."
1,Legendary Riders,"I have got to say that the ""Legendary Rider"" figures that I have seen are TERRIBLE looking. Logan looks like his face has been completely flattened and his head is too small for his body. The only ones of this series I haven't seen in the stores are the Scarlet Witch, Task-Master, and Ultron. I've seen the others, and they are easily the worst looking bunch of Marvel Legend figures to come out."
3,Big but fun,"I got this toy when my baby was quite small, about 4 mos, and I thought it would be way too big for her to enjoy (it's about 8 inches across). However, she liked chewing on the various ends and enjoyed the different textures. You can entertain the baby by holding onto an end and twirling the toy around - it makes a satisfying ratchety noise that the baby likes. This is a toy that should grow with your baby for quite some time."
3,Twisty toy...okay,"This toy has lasted two children now but is not much fun. My kids chewed on the teether part a lot but that's it. The twisting feature is hard for little ones to do and when they get it to twist accidentialy, it kinda scares them and they don't want to play with it anymore. As a teether I'd say it's good. They have four sides to choose from. But as a toy....not so much."
3,"Fun, but uncritical","""Retro Hell"" is the equivalent of your friends sitting around saying ""Hey, remember the Wonder Woman TV show?"" ""Yeah! And what about Diff'rent Strokes?"" It's fun as memories are jogged, but these glances at 70s & 80s culture are entirely non-critical.OK, so people loved roller disco: So what?"
5,Inspiring tales of hope,"This book is replete with optimistic tales about the Polish experience in America. My favorite is the story of Katarzyna Q. Razynska. When a power outage wreaks havoc on an unsuspecting Polish mall, this brave woman gives those around her hope . . . hope that when the escalator starts back up, she and her stranded compatriots will be able to free themselves and claim their dignity."
1,Buyer beware!,"I ordered this book as a Christmas gift, and I'm glad I decided to take a peek before wrapping it! The cover is for ""Polish-American Folklore,"" but the contents of the book are ""British Logistics on the Western Front."" I informed Amazon customer service about the problem and ordered a replacement copy. The replacement has the exact same problem! This time I requested a refund, and I plan on ordering the book from my local bookstore."
2,Too difficult,"This book is written exclusively for the academia and experts. It's a killer. I tried and tried but so many names and references and data and bibliography that when I finished it -yes, I did- I wasn't sure of one single thing about John's life. What was myth, what was true and what is hypothesis.A waste of time."
1,Order makes no sense,The cart is always before the horse in this book. It constantly covers more advanced topics without covering introductory topics. Example: It covers ions before covering electrons.
4,"Step by step learning, most essentials",The book covers most of the essential points about OpenGL. Step by step examples and developing techniques makes it more readable and entertaining.
1,Useless book,This is one of the worst books I've ever bougth. The examples are so simple that you can find much better sources of information for free in the Internet. The explanations are so shallow that you must search other sources. Keep your money and buy something else. It is a shame to publish such a book.
1,Just for compensation...,"Well, a book on OpenGL with Delphi. OpenGL is certainly a good graphics API, but forget about Delphi..."
4,The Great Divide,"(CD Review)Shows Willie has many stylings! Although he isn't necessarily good at all of them, these are. They are a stray from his popular Country sound, but one should remember Willie started singing before popular Country became the `Country Sound'. This is reminiscent of his ""Stardust"" and ""Blue Skies"" days. Good CD. Oh, yeah, interactive too."
3,"Worth a number of listens, but...","This is a good album. It may not be album of the year, but it is pleasant to listen to despite what many of these reviews say. That being said, there are about three very good songs, and a number of the others leave you feeling like Willie is coming to terms with his aging. Songs 'This Face', 'You Remain', and a few others may leave you feeling scared of growing old! Still, I'm not dissappointed I bought the album, and, like I said, it is still a hell of a lot better than a lot of other artists' albums. Any Willie fan would have to buy it."
2,Might be time to hang it up,Somebody should have tapped Willie on the shoulder before this one made it to the press. I never thought I would see it but I guess if you've been around as long as Willie and recorded so many fabulous works in all types of musical genres eventually you will exhaust the possibilities. Now Willie has. Its worth one listen only.
2,Don't buy this album!,"Contrary to what some other civilian reviewers have written on this site, this album is not a worthy addition to the Willie collection. I too bought the album because , well, it's Willie. Big disappointment. The duets are uneven, sometimes even impossible to listen to. While there are a few good songs on the album, not enough to reccommend it. And it is definitely not even close to ""Milk Cow Blues"" (A great album!)or even to ""Rainbow Connection."" If you are a die-hard fan of Willie, wait a couple of months, and you'll find this one in the used bin at the local cd store. trust me."
2,I am hurt to say this,"Let me start by saying I loved Teatro, Red-Headed Stranger, Shotgun Willie, Spirit, and his ""greatest hits"" records that I've heard. Unlike a lot of folks, I found plenty to like on Across the Borderline, too. THIS album, however, doesn't measure up. It's thoroughly overproduced, with guitar work and instrumental work utterly overwhelming the subtle joy of Willie's voice and always satisfying guitar playing. The production is like pop country, and I can only say I bought it on my feelings about his other material. He always changes the feel from record to record, which I like, but now and again you're going to fall on your face with that: so here's the tumble, let's hope the next one works. Sorry Willie, but I'd advise people to stay away from this one."
2,A pale contrast,"in the past two weeks i've procured both this album and willie's live album from the late 70s with the family. perhaps it's due to such a stark contrast with that earlier, energized and authentic performance that i find this album to be so remarkably unfulfiling. depressing, actually.yes, ""maria"" is catchy and the title track isn't bad, but the guest stars intrude, the production smothers, and the albums sinks beneath its own bloat. pity, really, as willie and his fans deserve better.to echo another reviewer, ""across the borderline"" covers the same concept in an infinitely more creative fashion; direct your attention there. or almost anywhere else in willie's catalog for that matter. and, of course, ""willie and family live"" is essential."
5,"I agree with K. C. from TX... ""out-friggin standing!""","the words, the music, and Willie's voice make this one of the BEST I've heard in a long time!!! The duet with Bonnie Raitt, ""You Remain"" is worth the price alone!"
2,ARRGGHH!!!,"This is NOT better than rainbow connection or Milk Cow Blues...in fact this is the worst willie record since that last major label travesty ""Across the Borderline"" and at least that one had ""still is still moving"". None of these songs will become willie classics... Simply put, this record sounds nothing like willie...it is overproduced and sappy...and why one of the greatest songwriters of all time would do a bunch of rob thomas and bernie taupin songs is beyond me...that said, probably one of the better pop releases this year so far, and whatever they play off of this on the radio will still be better than having to listen to clay walker or creed, so at least there's that...Decent pop record, horrible willie record."
5,Willie Still Amazes Me,"I have listened to this cd over and over and have purchased for other friends. Maybe these songs hit home at this time of my life, or maybe just the music and not the lyrics. Who knows, but it works and as usual, I am always excited to hear what Willie is feeling next. Because, after all, that is what music is......a feeling. I sincerely hope that this cd gets the airplay it deserves. And I hope they are included in Willie's songlist for the next concert I attend. GREAT ..."
2,Another Quincy Jones/Santana thing,oh the Guest Album's how they have changed the Game? Quincy Jones did this Concept for many a Moon but it was Carlos Santana that has gotten all the Juice from it in Big term sales.so Willie Nelson is next in line for the Big Cash Out.but like with Santana the Best Material here just as there to me was when the Artist themselves were showcased.overall you don't get the guest adding anything to the mix instead just a cool Pressence&very Little overall Substance to me.Willie Nelson has created some Great Stuff but this Set is basically going thru the Motions for a Album as to adding any depth to it.
1,don't buy this record,"I'm a big Willie Nelson fan for 20 years or more and this album is the worst that I can remember. It's so bad it prompted me to write my first review for Amazon after reading them anonymously for the past 4 years. [Bad], overproduced, sad really to put Willie Nelson's soulful voice in the middle of such hokey pop arrangements. These songs would fit best on a soundtrack for a Disney animated film. The same producer who brought real magic to Carlos Santana's SUPERNATURAL has buried Willie Nelson. Buy ACROSS THE BORDERLINE instead, an excellent execution of the same concept."
5,I love this album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I think that Willie Nelson is one of the best country/pop singers around! I absoulutely loved this album with all the songs on here being excellent!!! My favorites are:1. Maria (Shut Up And Kiss Me; with Rob Thomas)6. The Great Divide7. Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)10. Time After Time12. You Remain (with Bonnie Raitt). You should definetly get this one!!!!
3,Huh?,"What is with the bashing?. Every one on this CD are great talents. There is no question. Willie has done so much for so long for country music, that he can do anything his heart wants to do. If it displeases and upsets some fans, so be it. Willie doesn't care. He does what he wants to do. There's no reason why he can't. Willie could release a rock/rap CD if he wanted to do so. The one star reviews are entitled to their opinions, but they made some really uncivilized and unintelligible remarks. They obviously base things on their own narrow minded way of thinking and not on the great talent or humanity of the person. Yes, the CD isn't great, but it's not bad either. Willie is entitled to have an album or two that don't hit the mark. Every artist is. The people who are at the ready to attack, need to cool their heels and be quiet for a minute."
1,This is not the Willie I know and love!!!,"I have almost every Willie Nelson album made. I love him, I love his music, and I play them more than any other music that I have. However, this album is a big disappointment. Rather than singing about broken hearts, drinking too much and generally having too much fun, the underlying theme of this album seems to be getting old and getting wrinkled. Yuk! It's going to happen to all of us -- but do we want to sing about it. Also, I miss the Willie sound of Sister Bobbie on the piano and Mickey on the harmonica. This sounds a little like big band - Lawrence Welk - and who knows? Don't buy it!"
2,I like Lipton Better,"Well, I never thought I would say THAT !I've tried multiple brewing methods and so far (about half the bag already)I haven't really enjoyed this product. It is sold as ""loose tea"" but, it looks like and behaves like freeze-dried crumblies. It makes dark, brown tea in about 1 1/2 minutes. It's strong, but not flavorful. It has none of the delicacy I drink teas for, in the first place. This is the coffee of teas. Yes, it is better with milk and sugar in it, but it shouldn't have to be added to. No bouquet. Today, I used loose-leaf Lipton (very cheap at the W store). It is absolutely delicious and not flat like the Yorkshire. Reviews are subjective, of course. I must say that Taylor's makes very good teas, especially high-end tea bags (if you must)."
4,The River Warren is a unique literary approach,"The novel is certainly worth one's time. Told from the point-of-view of its characters, in several short snippets, each person is defined by the stories he/she tells. A small community attempts to come to terms with a bizzare incident, but its biggest obstacles as a community are in overcoming the prejudices of its people and its mindset. The novel is set in an interesting, rural backdrop, and is perfect as the microcosm for small-town U.S.A. Description is good, and though action (other than the prefatory accident that sets the story in motion) is minimal, the author still pulls off a stirring and very effective story. I would highly recommend this novel to all serious readers of mainstream or literary fiction, and especially to those practicing their craft as writers. It's a wonderful model."
3,It's an okay toy.,"My daughter has enjoyed this toy BUT I have a couple of negatives......1) The purple pieces (joints?) that allow the light up desk to open & close broke within a few months.2) The 1 light is in the middle so the desk doesn't exactly light up evenly. You have to move your picture around on the desk so you can see the lines to trace.3) Because of the placement of the light, storage is limited - much less than a child would like to have/need for papers & such.I looked forever for a light up desk like I had as a kid. This was the best bet at the time. Actually found mine at my parent's home shortly after my daughter rec'd hers. 20 yrs later it still works & better than this one. It is electric & the crayola one is battery. Wish I had found it b4 I bought this one."
3,Ok but....,"I bought this because of a review that said it was perfect to use for making cards, Well... It is marginal at best.The light only illuminates a 1/4 of the work surface that being the area directly above the small bulb. As for a kid using it it is fine as they aren't concerned too much about their work area!"
1,I hated it,this product was the worst in the world the lightbulb burned me and went out once or twice a day . Do Not Buy This Product !
5,"My husband & I loved this item, but kids :(",My husband and I liked this item and the quality of this item. My oldest loves to draw and was into tracing pictues under lamps and on windows so we searched for a tracing table. We weighed our options and we liked this one more than the roseart that does not require batteris etc. My daughter wanted the roaseart as seen on TV. I still think this one is better than the roseart you dont have to draw free hand. What do I know I am just her mother not an artist. MaryAnn
5,Old Kid,"I'm 48 years old and I got this to do my pictures with. Instead of paying so much for an expensive real lite box I got this. It works GREAT! I can lay my picture on my card stock and see perfect where to mark to cut out the hole for my picture on my greeting card. FANTASTIC. Does just what I wanted, The light does not hurt my eyes either.. GREAT for Greeting Card making.JUST LOVE IT!! Got here FAST TOO!!! Going to use it for my lettering too.."
5,great toy,"Our daycare has a toy similar to this one,however it is much more expensive. My daughter absolutely loves her tracing desk, she has already gone thru one set of batteries and a light bulb. She is six years old and the intricate designs really challenge her. I was very pleased with this toy and would not hesitate to buy it again."
3,"Good, simple fun","This product produced a few hours of fun for my 7-year-old daughter. She was attracted to the included, tracable clothing patterns. The product uses ""D"" batteries, which provide a long lasting, strong light. Since this is basically a light table, it works best with thin paper where the image is only on one side. A small pad of tracing paper is included and everything fits back into the 12"" x 11"" x 2.25"" container. My only concern is the ability to leave the light on and run the batteries down. I recommend it for any child between ages 6 and 8. It can also come in handy for adults."
5,My son loves the vehicle version !!!,"Yes, they make a version of this with vehicles to trace and my 6 yr old son loves it! For some reason the vehicle version is harder to find than the girls' fashion version. For any boy that loves to draw cars and trucks, this is great. Also, good for their fine motor skills."
4,Surprising twist to an Interesting Plot,"Melinda and company have been taking all of the books on an interesting curve. The book was wonderful, except, of course, for it's apparent lack of Michael and Maria interaction...there was some, but there's never enough for this Candygirl. As for the book, It was well written and it was fast reading. I read most of it today :) But there was a part that I was extremely disappointed with, and it completely blew me out of the water that this happened. So, because of this unfortunate part, I had to give it only 4 stars...when I would have given it 5. But it's worth reading, so go get it, and find out what happens."
4,Very enjoyable.,"Its a good story line, with characters that you want to follow and see where the next page takes them.I dont think there is much detail on the day to day lives of people from the 12 century, but I didnt miss that.Some writers have a great deal of detail and if done right it adds to the story. Sharon Penman does need that here."
5,"Fabulous read, give it a try.","This was the first Penman novel I read (recommended by another Amazon reader) and it's a whopper. I had serious doubts about it in the first chapter...I wasn't certain I'd be able to keep all of the historical figures straight and my unfamiliarity with anything Welsh made it difficult to follow at first. But as it turns out, after that first chapter, I simply could not put this book down.This is not a cheap romance book, folks. Rather, it is an extremely compelling historical novel in which Penman takes real-life people and fills in the historical blanks (personal details which we have no way of knowing for certain). Her research is absolutely meticulous and where historical mistakes are made, she acknowledges them on her website.Whether you are a medieval historian or just curious about this period of history, Penman will deliver a first-rate history lesson and a great tale at the same time."
4,Good Read but lacking substance,"I feel compelled to write this review because I feel this book is a good read with an engaging plot. It is a page turner for me but lacks a little bit of ""something special"".Firstly, I wish that the story did not focus so much on Joanna's even though, it helps give dimension to Llewelyn's character. I wish the author spoke more of the historical events of the time.Secondly, I wish we had appendices listing all the Welsh words and their translation as well as places. But mostly I wish for a list of characters and their relationship (ala Dorothy Dunnett) as well as a family tree for the Welsh and English royal houses. This would add more depth to the story as the reader could better understand the politics and relationships between states.As is, the book is a good read, but if you wish for some good historical fiction, Dorothy Dunnett is the queen of that domain."
5,Expertly blends history and romance!,"This is not a war novel and it is not a romance novel. It is, IMO, the perfect blend of historical fiction and romance. Although the novel is centered around the true love story of Joanna, daughter of King John, and Llewellyn, unofficial Prince of Wales, there is so much more to this epic novel. You are caught up in the world Penman creates. The descriptions are so lush and vivid it's like reading a movie. I absolutely love this story and highly recommend it!"
3,"A very talented writer, but...","I found the book most enjoyable - few people write with such clarity nowadays. (For this reason I plan on getting her other books!) From a historical view it is however sadly lacking, and she tends to leave out huge gaps in time. The book focuses very much on Joanna and her romantic feelings (I will confess this is not my genre) and leaves out the movements and conflicts of the key players (or the 'shapers of history' - if you will). I would recommend this book for good writing but not for its historical content."
3,More Romance than History,"I am usually wary of historical fiction, but there were so many five-star reviews that I decided to give Penman a chance.Like another reviewer, I only made it to page 283, and that was after 4 weeks. I finally put it down. There were parts that were wonderful - I enjoyed the passages regarding John Plantagenet and Eleanor of Aquitaine and the young Llewelyn.And there were parts that I could not stand; most of them regarding Joanna. I did not care if her step-son learned to respect her or if her husband made love to her or if her daddy remembered her wedding. I skimmed pages hoping for it to stop.I can understand the five-star reviews for those who like historical romance. This one is well done. For the rest of us, though: be warned!"
5,My favorite book,"All of Sharon Kay Penman's books are fabulous, but Here Be Dragons is my favorite. I have two copies of it, because I read the first one to pieces. Its one of those books that makes you feel as though you have experienced another place and time. I highly reccommend it to anyone who likes to get lost in a book."
5,Here Be A Great Book!,"I really enjoyed this book. The only complaint I would have is the overwhelming amount of characters!- makes it somewhat hard to keep track of who's who (especially when so many of them have the same names!!) However, that did not stop me from purchasing the 2nd book of the series, nor will it stop me from purchasing the 3rd!!! I think the price is quite reasonable as well."
2,Too sensationalized,Too much about the sensationalized personal lives of the nobility and little about what it was like for a broad spectrum of people at the time.
2,"Too Much History, Not Enough Fiction","I read historical novels because the history makes a good story even better. For me, this story is weighed down by the historical facts and falls short on the storytelling. I fully expected to love it, but I did not get fully engaged in the characters, and if you don't have that in a novel, you don't have anything."
5,Fabulous!,"Although it started out a bit slow, this book has become one of my all time favorites! So true to life, it takes you to the Middle Ages, enthralls you. The main characters are some of my favorite from any book. Make no mistake; this is truly a love story, but not for those who just want fluff.I have always found novels that went into depth regarding many of the main characters to be the best.I felt I knew Joanna & Llewlyn:I cried several times over their story.If you loved Madeline Hunter's ""Protector"", yet want something more, this is the book for you. Can't wait to order Ms Penman's other books!"
1,boooring,This book was picked for me by Goodreads because I read a lot of historical fiction. I read reviews that said it takes some time to get into. I read 150 pages of this book and was still not into it but I pushed on. At 200 plus pages I was still bored out of my mind. The author jumps from time period to time period and gives no explanation as to where and when he now was writing about. The characters had no depth. I do not recommend it. I am sorry I wasted my money
3,Too long,Good book but too long. Begins to be more of a task to finish than an enjoyable adventure about half way through the book.
5,Cymru Am Byth,"A beautiful, magical work. The reviewer who compared it to a Harlequin Romance with a bit of history probably isn't used to reading imaginative, historically-based novels like this one. Yes, most of the characters DID exist but Ms. Penman is a WRITER and therefore at liberty to discuss Llewelyn and Joanna as much as she likes without it taking away from the validity of the work. If you want pure dates and events, read historical NON-fiction! Therefore, I don't think one can review this book for what it is and not see the absolute beauty in it. Only one side of my family is Welsh, but I have always felt FAR more pull towards that aspect of my heritage than the other side. It is a beautiful place and Ms. Penman's work brings Welsh history to life."
2,Are you a lover of romance novels or historical fiction or both?,"This book was recommended to me because I am a ravenous reader of historical fiction. I found this book more of a romance type novel It seemed to be presented like the ""history plays"" we use to put together in elementary school. You would take a time period and each class would take a major or minor event in that time period and act it out. We'd go to the library, get the gist of it and contrive the characters on how we thought they would be at that time. What you got was a play with shallow characters, flat dialogue and dubious accuracy on how it all went down. If you love a good romance novel than this might be for you but if you're more a solid historical fiction person than this may not be the novel for you."
4,A Portrait of a Period of Ambiguity,"This first volume of Ms. Penman's ""Welsh Trilogy"" is perhaps (by a small margin) the least compelling of the three, but it provides a solid foundation for understanding the other two. Its hero, Llewelyn the Great, tried to do the impossible, to unite the warring factions of Wales while making peace with England in the Norman-English way, by strategic marriage. To understand the sad loss of the independence of Wales, it is critical to start here, because the pattern of this book is repeated again and again over many decades: the Welch rebels keep thinking that they can use the English lords as their allies against their own in-power countrymen, only to find that Wales always loses in the end. Still, they never learn the lesson, and the Welch remain disunited pawns of the English crown and nobles. I'll resist the temptation to draw modern parrallels, but they are starkly and sadly there."
4,Great story for history novices,"Penman tells a great story here. I am terrible with history-dates, names, all that stuff. But through her book I can gain a perspective and see history through the shoes of those who lived it. Of course it's fiction, but it helps me get interested enough to actually pay attention and care about what happened in 13th century Europe"
4,Here Be Good Reads,"Sharon Kay Penman has done a very good job penning a good read in this historical fictional account of the life of King John I of England and the politics of the English/Welsh relationship in the twelfth century. Though the characters tend to lack any real emotional development, the events are assiduously researched and the author does a good job of keeping a well-oiled pace. One of the delights of this book is being mildly aghast at once-common practices, such as marrying twelve-year-old children, and the facile relationship with death. A great read for those looking for an informative, entertaining novel."
3,Good read,This book got off to a slow start. Too much arguing in it.overAll a good read and wasn't disappointed but needs less dram!!
2,Good characters and story but too long...,I enjoyed the first half of the book but it just drug on too long. By the end I could not even remember what the disagreement was even about. It had good characters and a good plot it just keep on rehashing the same old thing.
3,From the back cover:,"Revenge...Italian style!A gold-digger, that was all Charlotte Summerville was, and she was going to get everything she deserved! Billionaire Jake d'Amato was determined to make the money-grabbing beauty pay. His plan was simple. He'd take revenge - in his bed!It might have looked as if Charlie was avaricious, but her intentions were purely innocent - just like her! Jake's masterful lovemaking blew her away, but passion had its consequences...Suddenly she was married to a man who wanted her but hated her...and she was pregnant with his child!"
2,Recording quality disappoints,"I realize it's difficult to record such a large orchestra and choruses, but this BD had me examining the settings on my playback system to try to mitigate the flat, almost muffled sound. I could find no fault with my system and had to conclude the recording sadly misses on the dynamics and clarity that is so important to this work.The performance itself is beyond reproach, but this BD falls sadly short in recording skill and effort, and does a great disservice to the recorded material."
1,Don't believe everything you read!,"I recently purchased a book, ""Sondheim & Co"", from this bookseller. I was specifically looking for the 1989 paperback edition of the book as it had information on later Sondheim shows. I'm directing one of his later shows and this was to be a very important piece of research. The only one I found that fit this discription was $50. The other, earlier 1974 editions were plentiful on Amazon and all priced under $10.The shipment came to me very quickly. But when I opened the package, I found a 1974 edition, which is totally useless to me. I contacted the vendor via email to tell them I was shipping back the book and wanted a full refund, including shipping. They advised that they would refund my monies as soon as they received the book. UPS shows it was delivered last Wed, it is now Monday and no credit on my card.I will follow-up and I imagine ultimately obtain my money, but this is a hassel I didn't need and I still don't have the research material I need."
4,Well done.,"This script is probably their(the Coens) best, Fargo not withstanding. I see this as more of a shooting script rather than a screenplay, in the traditional sense. There several references to point of view and the camera location or angle used in a slugline form. No matter, the pace and mood of this story are beautiful and haunting. I think it's the simplicity of the action and the great detail paid to the action that enthrall the reader. If you've seen the film, it's dark and atmospheric texture are a direct result of the attention given within the script. Well done."
3,Too scary?,"Informative book, with nice illustrations. Perhaps a bit too scary for a small child? I found it rather sad to read about two small children escaping the volcano and watching from a distance as all of their village and loved ones are buried alive. Eek."
5,a real Companion to the cosmos,"I first read this book in 1999, and have always wanted to own one. this was probably my first 'serious' foray into proper cosmology after reading several random articles in newspapers and magazines. Ofcourse its not a 'book' book in the likes of Brief History or The First Three Minutes, but rather a handbook of cosmology, and an excellent one at that! (AND comprehensive)John Gribbin is known for his clarity and lucidity of his pop-sci writing; this is another proof.Buy it!"
3,This book is very entertaining.,"This book is very entertaining because, its a good way to pass time by. I would recomend this book to people because i think they would enjoy it very much. It is very funny and child-like."
3,Mostly pretty good...,"Emily Mann's play ""Execution of Justice"" was taken entirely from transcripts of Dan White's trial and events/news clips in its wake. This Showtime production is very different showing instead the lives of Dan White and Harvey Milk leading up to the murders.Mostly it's pretty accurate and gives a lot of insight to the times and personalities. Peter Coyote's portrayal of Harvey Milk is a little hagiographic. Seeing some of the ""warts"" would be a bit more deep and humanizing. (Yes, Harvey sometimes sneered at people.)Khalil Kain's portrayal of Sister Boom Boom as a one-man greek chorus always fluttering around Harvey was especially weird as Harvey was killed before the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence and Sr. Boom Boom ever appeared. It works as a dramatic device, but for those of us who were there it's just conspicuously wrong in a screenplay that is otherwise generally good on the facts."
1,Why pay for info surfing the web brings free?,"I bought this book to help me aid my entry back into school at the ripe old age of 30. I figured, ""Great! Peterson's is know for good guides, and I can use all the help I need"". Unfortunately, The information contained in the book is readily available on a wide variety of websites for free, and if you are reading this, you obviously have access to the web! I would save your money on this one. Instead, use the money you would have spent on application fees, and surf the web."
1,This book stinks!,"I bought this used (thankfully I did not spend a lot on it) thinking it would provide a decent overview of graduate and undergrad scholarships...not so!! The undergrad and grad sections where the scholarships are listed are just about identical! Nothing is listed easily - for instance English scholarships are under Literature/Communications, for which there are only 3 listings. Don't buy it!!"
4,getting money,"I was looking for books that would help me find money for law school. This book was great! It gave some avenues that hadn't yet crossed my mind. I would say that if you want to go to school and still have money to eat, get this book (I wish I had it before I started undergrad)."
3,Simple Clock,"Simple clock I would use for possibly camping but nothing much more. Requires batteries that so if its bumped off of a nightstand will fall out and you will have to reset date, time, alarm etc. Nice display and easy to read though. Nice touch with the weather."
3,Great as a Clock--Not so Great as an Alarm,"TheSharp SPC309C LCD Backlight Alarm Clock (Silver)is way too loud. The beeps increase in frequency over time, so there is an incredible sense of urgency---not to wake up, but to hit the snooze button or turn it off. Unless, of course, you know that it is actually quite an impatient little thing. It will shut itself off if you can wait it out (stuffing it under a pillow works well) and you can go back to sleep. In terms of an alarm clock, it is really quite useless.The display is bright, with big numbers. The functions are easy to use. And, the battery seems to last forever. The only thing missing is the main feature--a good alarm."
4,Sharp alarm clock,Good appearance and functionability. The process to set the clock and/or alarm is not hard but bothersome.
3,Not what I expected.,"I searched for this under atomic clocks and I guess I didn't understand the narrative of features, which is unusual for me. I'm normally pretty astute. This is not a self setting clock. Further, it does have a backlight, but seeing it at night involves reaching over and hitting the light button. Again, not what I wanted or expected. The clock works fine, but it's a disappointment as far as what I wanted. Too bad for me!"
4,Great for the Price,"The worst feature on this item is the display begins to fade when the batteries weaken. I suggest rechargeable batteries for this item. Other than that the clock does just what is advertised. Since the price is low you cannot expect the item to be to fancy although, as mentioned, it's great for the price."
4,Not bad,"Overall the book is not bad. When playing some of the melodies, they don't exactly match the version on the CD's. Close enough for enjoyment though."
3,"No, really--melody lines ONLY","Yes, I read the description. I consider myself a mediocre-at-best guitarist, with almost no flatpicking ability, so I was hoping this would be a little push in the right direction. This says ""intermediate level"" but as long as you can read tab, you should be able to handle this.Melody lines *only* don't tell you much that you couldn't figure out on your own, even if you're pretty novice. Melody lines aren't even that interesting: Really, would you rather have just the melody as Blake sings it or would you rather have some pointers on his ornamentation? Even just a few pointers? (Why would you want to sing it *exactly* as he does, anyway? Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose of this kind of music?)I'm still glad I got it, but I'm not blown away.Oh, and mine DOES NOT have a spiral binding, which is a royal pain in the neck. Music books and cookbooks should ALWAYS have spiral bindings so they lie open on their own."
4,The Untitled Col. L. Fletcher Prouty manuscript is a...,"Goldmine of Information aboutthe New World Odor syncophants(The High Cabal, Prouty callsthem, correctly, I beleive)who wish to try to controlour World and who killed our35th President. Don't beleiveit? Get to Len Osanic's sitewhile It's still on the www."
5,"""Les""... a Genius misappreciated in France : shame on us !","In France... about Les Paul's death... only 4 lines on only one popular news paper... and that's all !!!!Les Paul Trio, your record is wonderful : Thank you to let me enjoy playing the guitar with you.(Sorry again for my so bad English)."
1,Cheap:/,"The actual image of the mucles man is awesome - well done and clear. But the clip on the clip board, is plastic and broke within the first day of use. I actually bought one before at the body worlds exhibit and the same thing happened to both. For the price - its a shame!"
4,Another Great Edition,"I have the first Blues tape, and was waiting for the next volume to come out. This is a great series for people like myself who don't have enough time for private lessons. The instructors are fun and informative, not boring like some of these other tapes. Can't wait for the next blues in the series. Thanks !"
3,Not the same as Vol. 1,"I had Vol. 1 of Classic Blues on VHS way back when it was just Songxpress.The product on VHS was awesome! But I think in the DVDs vol.2 and vol.3, they edited a lot of quality material that was on VHS tapes.The biggest dissappointment was on the final performance of DVD for vol.2 and vol. 3 of Classic Blues. They edited out the entire performance..only giving you half the performance. Very Sad.On my old VHS tapes, i really enjoy playing along with their entire performances plus, you get to see Dan Warner perform solos in the songs..which I pick up by watching him play.I am sad that the product is reduced to a mediocore product compared to the original VHS recordings."
2,quite uncomfortable,"I bought the red slippers, but maybe the yellow ones might have looked cuter...but overall fit is quite uncomfotable. If you ever tried a pair of any shoes that has an elastic on the back of the shoes(which is a trend these days), you would know they feel like you have a rubber band around your feet, and the elastic pushes your feet forward, inevitably making your toes touch the front part of the shoes, which doesn't have any cushion...i had to cut the elastic somewhat to make it more comfortable....so if you are looking for comfotable shoes to wear, this isn't the shoes for you."
2,Disappointed and disgusted...,"Let me first say that I wanted to like this movie. I liked the main character even though he's a huge puss. I wanted to see him succeed. But there are way too many flaws for this movie to work for me. This poor guy is so down on his luck that he would eat a plate of gravy smothered dung? Do yourself a favor and just watch reruns of Fear Factor. The ending is not shocking nor is it a ""twist"". It's just another way for the main character to prove his puss-ness yet again & show us once & for all that he's no hero. C'mon man, really? After butchering a whole gang of bikers, finishing that steaming pile of excrement & executing ur girlfriends dog and u couldn't finish the last task? I call bulls***. Enough with movies trying to go for the total gross-outs. Horror is supposed to be scary."
3,"Entertaining, but a bit disappointing in the end",The premise of the film is great. The movie keeps your attention and keeps you guessing. I was so disappointed in the end of it though. Almost enough for me to hate the film altogether.
4,Interesting,"The premise is that ''everything begins with a single step', and poses the question, ""Does everyone have a price?"" How far will someone go before the moral ""stop sign"" kicks in...IF it kicks in.This Thai movie is being remade by Daniel Stamm as ""Angry Little God"", which will be out in 2013. Look forward to seeing how he treats the subject."
4,GREAT COMEDY,"Yes, I know, this is a horror movie, but it has hilarious moments. 13 Game of Death is defined by a grotesque sense of humor and it's brilliant. Gore comedy at its best."
3,The Thai Version of SAW!!!,"I thought this was pretty good. A guy has to do 13 challenges and he'll get $100 million. If he quits, he loses everything. My favorite challenges were 3,7,8, and 10. Challenge #5 grossed me out. If you like creepy games, and 'SAW' You'll probably like 13: GAME OF DEATH!!!"
2,Extremely Unextreme,"Why in the world this is put out under the Dimension Extreme label I will never know. This is the most ""unextreme"" movie I have seen from them yet. Easily a PG-13. I really wanted this to work, but I'm sorry, it just did not click for me. The people that are comparing this to ""Saw"" have obviously not seen it. I love Thai movies (Alone) and some other Dimension Extreme features (Inside, Storm Warning). Don't expect much from this. The cover is pretty much misleading. Boring, boring, boring."
1,not even a B movie!,I couldn't even finish watching this movie! It is dubbed in english& not very well! Don't buy unless u like wasting money!
4,Great premise...very well done.,"Thank God for movies like this. I don't know exactly what genre I'd classify this one as... part horror, part thriller, fully awesome. We follow a meager office worker as he goes through his dull existence, until one day after he is fired he get a strange call. From there it gets odd... he is on a game show being played in the real world, he gets calls with things he has to accomplish and if he does all thirteen he will win a huge cash prize.This movie is surprisingly well made, and endlessly inventive with some solid acting to boot. If you're into experimental films even in the slightest you must see this one. A great break from the norm and an easy recommendation. 4.25/5 stars"
5,HAHA! Good stuff!,"I really enjoyed this movie. The violence was great. The gore was great. When I first heard about this movie, I wasn't sure it would be something I wanted to see. I typically don't like plots that have to do with a crazy person by phone compelling an innocent person to do stuff. 13:Game of Death pulled it off for me. If you like violence, blood, hopeless and helplessness, you should check this one out."
5,The Lair: Season 2,"The DVD set is of top quality. All discs and episodes played properly, with sharp, clear pictures and good audio. As for the show itself, Season 2 is in every way a worthy companion and successor to Season 1. I enthusiastically recommend the product to anyone who is interested in the subject matter."
3,Beautiful and heavy flatware,"I bought this set for my mother for her birthday almost a year ago. I was attracted by the name brand, the look and the price. I was also interested in the 18/10 stainless; I find it tends to keep its shine soooooooooo much longer than 18/8.They are really just beautiful utensils--rather large, like the continental style, and very heavy which just *feels* like quality to me.Unfortunately, Mom recently told me that the knife blades tend to get small rust spots if washed in the dishwasher! She stated it as though all stainless flatware does and I had to insist (and prove with my 4 year old Oneida 18/10 stainless) that, no, that is not the case! So that was a great disappointment to me. Mom is still quite happy with the set--it's only she and my dad, so it's no hardship to wash a couple of knives by hand--but I feel a bit disillusioned.Overall it was a steal for the price (I paid $60-ish for 106 pieces!) and I would recommend it. Just be aware your knives may be vulnerable."
4,The book w/cd-rom will help students learn the New Testament,"At the collegiate level, the colorful book combined with the enhanced cd-rom and study questions for each chapter will significantly assist the student in learning basic New Testament content and doctrinal truth. The authors are clearly qualified and experienced in New Testament studies and this experience shows."
1,subpar,"i guess i should not have skimped on a chromatic pitch pipe. this one is poorly made, a few of the notes were not working when i received it. i think i should have spent an extra $10 and gotten a better pitch pipe....you really got to struggle hitting the correct note with this one"
2,Esperaba mas,"He leido otros libros de Roberto Bolaño, y realmente este ha sido el que menos me ha atraido. Puede ser muy interesante leer este libro antes de leer 2666 o Los Detectives Salvajes, pero despues de leer esos otros libros del mismo autor este se nota que fue escrito antes de lograr su gran estilo."
5,Plenty of product,"Not only did it come with the silicone case + elastic arm band, it also came w/ a screen cleaner and protector. This was a surprise and sure added to the great value."
5,Devil Boat,The product arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. I enjoyed the DVD itself as it was a good history and described the effort to rebuild the boat.
3,Devil Boat,"Some years ago I became interested in WWII PT boats. I have traveled to Fall River, MA where there are two restored PT's. Living in FL, I had the opportunity to ride on a restored PT in the Daytona Beach area a couple of years ago. It was a great thrill. This boat is stationed out of Key West.. The movie I am reviewing is the story of restoring a PT and while it is OK, I somehow expected more. It is OK but not great and that is why I rated it only three (3) stars.There are not better choices. If you can find it PT 109 is a great movie on either video or DVD. The PT was what was used to evacuate MacCarthur from the Phillipines. The written story of this trip is well worth reading. It is a miracle that the mission was successful as they used a lot of 'dead reckoning' and a compass not much more that what a Boy Scout uses."
4,La dolce Napoli,"I had first discovered Claudio on napster, so I needed more. I was not in the least disappointed in this CD. Both the bittersweet softness and sense of drama that is so Italiano!! You must hear it!"
2,What a shame!!,"If you are a hard core 70's rock concert fan this MAY be for you.First, let's say that sound quality and image are less than poor, so if you are looking for top digital transfer: FORGET IT.Hard Core Fan? If you are so, then you can enjoy (with some effort), what for me are the the highlights of the whole show: Family, Pink Floyd (just a portion of their long performance at the concert), Santana (at his best) and It's a Beautiful Day (simply amazing. Did they play just 2 songs?). Soft Machine's Esther's Nose Job performance is long lost since the days of the first issues on VHS (also, where is the rest of their performance?).Just half star thinking as a human being and two stars being extremely nostalgic and deeply hard core. There's an audio CD somewhere (bootleg?) that it's worth to be listened to."
5,Love it!,"My 2 month old son loves this swing! I love that it can go from room to room, it's easy to carry and when going on a trip doesn't take up too much room. I even put it on the dining table while I'm cooking dinner so he can be close to me! It was also very easy to put together... Over all, I'm glad that I bought it, and I'm glad that it's so lightweight and easy to move around!"
4,Working Blues,"This is a working person's book. Many of the poems have the feel of the poet writing notes on a small pad during brief breaks at work, imprinting observations about customers, workers, produce, clouds, items in the dumpster. The poems feel like a cross between Basho amd William Carlos Williams--the immediacy and sensitivity of haiku with the sharp eye of Dr. Williams. Lau further creates the working environment by intercutting announcements on the intercom. If you like the work poems of Philip Levine, you will like this book."
3,water pilates,"I found the voice was not coordinated with the picture. She was moving her mouth, but it wasn't in sync with the audio. This was very distracting. Also, there was too long a pause between exercises and the screen was completely black during this time. Music or just water pictures would have been better. The movements in the water used an under water camera for each exercise and this was helpful. It looked challenging and I found I will try this form of water pilates."
4,Good book,"I bought this book,but wasn't sure if I was doing the tapping right,so I bought the vhs video as well,and it made a big difference.There were things in the video,even Gary Craig didn't have in any of his.I did buy most of his as well.If you want to treat yourself and a few others,get the book and their video,which would be great together.If you want to professionally treat others,you'll have to buy Gary Craig's dvd's as well,because the more you know the better.The sequence is the same for most problems,but it's good to have lots of info.If you're interested in healing others and yourself,you should also look into Reiki which I have also.You can buy a dvd on here by Steve Murray,so you can get a level one attunement.Gotta love Reiki,it's good for you too."
2,just waste money,"My computer vaio already has 512MB. When I bought this item, I thought it is 2X512 MB, total is 1 GB. I checked in my bios, it is total 512MB. I try so many ways but I still got 512MB. My laptop is still slow and I just waste my money."
1,Corsair memory card,"The memory cards did not work in my Dell Inspiron 5100 laptop. When I turned the computor on with the two new cards in place, the computor turned on for a couple of seconds and then shut down."
1,More junk form China,I bought one of these from a local pet shop for an ornamental display in my tank. It lasted 2 months. Good thing there were no critical systems that depended on this unit. Don't waste your money!
5,If Only Christians Would Buy Books Like This One!,"The average Christian books are so full of milk, fluff, worldly philosophies, and secular business teachings but seldom contain sound doctrine or meat from the Word of God. You will not find, for example, doctrinal books at the top of Christian best seller lists. How sad!Dr. Sinclair Ferguson's book is a breath of fresh air for understanding the theology involved in the normal Christian life. His book is not a book of how to's or pop psychology but is a sound doctrinal book for every disciple of Jesus. Ferguson covers in 218 pages the theology of Christians. He covers our sinfulness, justification, election, prayer, and glorification and much more. He gives Scriptural truths for the sanctified life. This book is highly recommended!"
5,"Great glue, my primary 'go to' item.","Easy to use, better than white glue, bonds well, easy clean up, and environmentally friendly. Exactly what I wanted."
5,Wow!,"I just bought a used (but mint) copy of this for $50.00. And it was worth every penny. Not only are there amazing (really amazing) nudes of male models like Joe Sayers, Raphael Verga and the Carlson twins, but Bruce Weber's photography of less titillating subjects is beautiful, too. If you like his work, this is the most satisfying collection since Bear Pond. At least that's what I think!"
4,Syrian Christ,This was a facinating presentation of the Bible from the perspective of a Christian minister whose youth offered him a unique vien of the biblical envoronment.
2,The edited full screen version,"I love this movie, unfortunately I have to give it two stars because it's an edited full screen version. The music, action and ending are all picture perfect, or it will be when it's finally released in it's original widescreen and original length."
2,Who is that masked man?,"I don't know who screwed up here, Amazon or the DVD producers, but the picture of the DVD has the Zorro from Disney's TV series, Guy Williams, pictured on it, not Alain Delon. But this error might be indicative of the stories I've heard about the UPGRADED DVD of this film, which has been reported to be low quality and chopped up like salad, with some of the tomatoes missing, which is why I never bought it. But, I did see the original version at theaters, and it is excellent, with Delon making a great Zorro. But on the other side of the mask, I think he comes off with too much effeminacy, as though he is gay, but not to the extreme George Hamilton did in the deliberate gay version of the, in that case, fox-tailed coat. If and when I hear that the producers get their act together to put out a version that, if not improved, is at least not cut up and missing segments, I'll buy it. But until then, the below-six or five-dollar price for this is MAYBE what it's worth."
4,Great movie! I wish it wasn't as chopped or had better video quality.,"This is cult classic Zorro that appeared countless times during the 1970's. I can remember sitting up next to our 27 inch console tv singing along to the theme song ""Zorro's Back"". This was played about once a year on the CBS evening movie. Remember, this was a time before internet and thousands of tv channels.It's now 30+ years later and I'm introducing Zorro to my 5 year old. I was surprised how well the movie held up with a story line. I really enjoyed watching the movie with the only disappointments being the video quality and some poor editing. It doesn't quite live up to being played on a 50 inch HDTV with 7.1 surround sound.However, for a movie under [...] and the opportunity to review a piece of my childhood television watching, I suggest making the purchase!"
5,Zorro,"The movie was excellent. Had someone waited a few more years to restore this movie, it would not have been as good. Alain Delon did an outstanding job as both Don Diego and Zorro."
4,Best Friday sequel (along with 2),"This Friday film had a really entertaining cast, and a really entertaining backstory and 'big chasing/ending'It was the only sequel that really scared me as a little kid when I used to rent these at the video store nearly ten years ago. The blu ray looks fantastic and the 3D version is of course, classic. Good sequel, fun series. Great blu ray, recommended"
1,Poor 3-D Release.,"This red/blue 3D version does not work. Period. You get a tiny bit of depth every so often, but its really bad. This is one of the worst 3D presentations I have yet to see, in any format. Like the other standard DVD's that have come out recently, the color is completely washed out. The print of both the 3D and non-3D versions are very grainy. No extras, except for the Trailer. Just a bad release all around. It's a shame that this couldn't be released in the non-red/blue, polarized version...I have that one - from a copy of a copy of a copy on VHS - and the effects are still superior to this one."
4,Most of Jason's movies are pretty bad`,I didn't like the second and I didn't really like the first. Jason X was good but did they need to make nine rough drafts first. This one was bad but I thought some of the characters were ok. The same thing happens everytime though. At the end of all the movies a girl is left running away from Jason. Is that worth seeing ten times. Jason's my least favorite slasher of the three and his movies are by far the worst. Please don't make Friday the 13th part 11.
4,VERY GOOD FOR A JASON MOVIE,"IN THIS ONE, JASON REGAINS CONCIOUSNESS AND CONTINUES HIS VIOLENT SPREE AT CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE. VERY ENJOYABLE MOVIE ON ALL LEVELS. THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST IN THE FRIDAY THE 13TH SERIES. THIS MOVIE WAS ORIGINALLY IN 3-D, BUT IN THE VIDEO AND DVD, JASON'T JUST HIS REGULAR TWO DIMENSIONAL SELF. GOOD MOVIE AND IT'S VERY THRILLING. WHAT ALSO MAKES THIS SO SPECIAL IS THAT JASON IS FINALLY SEEN IN HIS FAMOUS HOCKEY MASK. I'D RECCOMEND THIS TO ANY HORROR FAN."
1,Crappie,Never buy 3D movie unless it says BluRay 3D. Never made it to the end I was expecting too much for a low price movie. Price was great. I just was let down because I bought a 3D HDTV for Christmas. It still is a great movie but set it aside to watch real 3D movies.
1,Sick! ...I would give it a BIG FAT ZERO if I could.,"In this ""Friday The 13th"" film,a young woman who is pregnant gets brutally murdered,by a fire poker being stabbed through her belly,killing her and the baby inside of her too.How is that entertainment? That is just morally sick! Being killed off is one thing,but like THAT? I mean,come on. Anybody who would get enjoyment out of this is just as sick as the person who came up with the idea to have the young woman killed off in that fashion with a baby in her womb.Complete trash! I give this film ZERO stars!"
3,Make the video in 3-D!,One of the better movies. The 3-D looks like it would be great. The acting seems better. Diana Kimbell needs more acting lessons.
2,Review of 3-D Only!,"The 3-D for this DVD is outright terrible, they didn't even take the time to correct it. I'm sure it would look outstanding with BluRay 3-D or polarized, but anaglyph didn't do it justice and gave it a terrible name. Yet another horrible release from Paramount Home Videos... Terrible, terrible, terrible 3-D!!! STAY AWAY."
3,The Pulse Is Weakening.,"The Friday the 13th series is one that will go down in history as one of the most celebrated, yet bad series of all time. This entry still shows that there's life in the series, although it doesn't do that good of a job showing you the possibility.This, as with the first twoFriday the 13thandFriday the 13th, Part 2, begins where the pervious one ended. This edition brings Jason back for his second go around and it's more of the same.Another recommended, but mostly for a watch release."
5,very creepy slasher flick!,I love the friday the 13th movies. They are scary and gory. they totally creep you out. this dvd is good. buy it.
3,One of the best in the series,"Friday the 13th Part 3: 3D is one of those films that scared me when I was bout 4. I mean a guy in a hockey mask chasing you in the woods? The film wa shot in 3D and features some cool scenes, nudity etc. These films aren't made to be Oscar worthy they are made to be fun and that what this is now that I'm 26 it's still a fun movie."
4,3-D,"Friday the 13th Part 3 in 3D will feature both the regular 2D version, as well as (for the first time ever on DVD) 3D version, complete with a pair of 3D glasses. This edition will be in Widescreen 16x9-enhanced with 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound! It will also have the theatrical trailer."
5,A Classic F13 with the best chase sequence in the series.,"It is the single greatest movie known to man, and 1000 words wont do it justice, so i'll just stop writing."
2,Yep the 3D sales pitch is a rip off.,"Just like the other people here who bought this cause it makes you belive it will be in 3D, it is not in 3D, well barely. Pretty terrible, and misleading too."
5,JASON,"THIS WASN'T AS SUSPENSEFUL AS 1 AND 2-BUT IT'S STILL A GREAT MOVIE!I LIKED THE MOTORCYCLE GANG.ANDY WAS CUT DOWN THE MIDDLE AND TIED UP LIKE A PRETZEL.I DIDN'T LIKE CHRIS AND RICK.CHRIS SCREAMED ALL THE TIME, AND RICK WAS A DORK.JASON STILL IS GREAT-AND HE ALWAYS WILL BE!"
1,"I ENJOY THIS CORNY SERIES, BUT THIS ONE IS JUST BAD","I AM A BIG FAN OF THIS CORNY SERIES, BUT THIS FILM IS JUST VERY BAD. THE FILM WAS ORIGINALLY IN 3D AND SINCE WE DON'T HAVE GLASSES WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IMAGES THAT ARE JUST AT ANNOYING ANGLES. AND SINCE THE FILM WAS ORIGINALLY IN 3D, THE DIRECTOR OF THIS FILM CONCENTRATES MORE ON 3D IMAGES THEN ON THE FUN PLOT. I RECCOMEND THAT YOU SKIP THIS ONE."
1,A USELESS SEQUEL TO A ONE STAR FILM,"Why anyboby would continue to torture us with this blood and guts, no plot crap is beyond me. I mean there's no guessing as to who the killer is a first-grader could figure it out. Plus the teenagers aren't characters you'd find interesting anyway so you don't even care that they are killed anyway. I wish I could give this film no stars, it richly desrves it!!!."
1,did steve miner really direct this movie-h20 was way better,this is the third time round for camp crysta;l lake killer jason voorhees and by god you though the series would grow on to become a little better and have some one pic up the peices from the disasterous part 2!(which steve miner also directed) but he just breaks it up even thinner.well this is supppose to be 3d but it is as flat as a pancake and as stupid as the teletubbies!!!.this horror series shouldve been panned out more carefully sean s cunningham should be very ashamed of how his 2 follow ups have turned out.this is even worse than 1&2 butnot as bad as halloween 3! and thats saying something
3,Third Installment,This third Friday the 13th film is actually kind of scary. Jason hacks people up the duration of the film. You know what's coming. I would recommend it to horror fans. A nice shower scene.
3,ok but not my favorite,"This is an ok movie of the series, but definitely not one of my favorites. My two favorites are Part 4 and Part 6. It just wasn't as good as either of them. I'm not saying I dislike this movie, I just don't love it. Still, I recommend buying this movie if you havn't seen it."
3,"Yes, this Blu-ray WILL work","The guy above is trying to be helpful, but he doesn't understand something very basic about HD: PAL/NTSC issues no longer matter. Those are standard-def issues only. As long as this disc isn't region-coded (and Amazon doesn't seem to carry region-locked Blu-rays), it will play fine.Once again, PAL/NTSC issues DON'T MATTER when it comes to Blu-ray/Hi-def."
3,"The least ""Deluxe"" of the new Friday the 13th releases","Don't expect much from this new ""deluxe"" edition. There are no special features except for a trailer--no commentary, no featurettes. The only thing special about this new release is that it's in 3D and comes with glasses (if you're lucky and buy it new) and that it has been remastered."
2,To Cement the Facts...,"I saw Friday the 13th Part III during its original theatrical run when I was 11, and it was, in fact, presented polarized with clear glasses, not in anaglyphic red/blue; anyone who says to the contrary has, sadly, a very poor memory. I kept the glasses for many years, only to lose them during an apartment move in the early '90's; to this day, I wish I hadn't been so careless.The point: Please be certain to have your facts straight about these movies before posting such rhetorical nonsense."
1,movie is good but not the 3D effect,"The 3D effect of this movie is horrible. Compared to today's 3D movies, this one is a junk. I'd wish I bought the 2D version instead. So bad I can't return it."
4,"I like the movie, but I would wait for a real 3D Blu-Ray","Ever since the release of Avatar, the demand for 3DTVs has gone up and now since the BDA has made a new standard for 3D content on Blu-Ray disk media, it's safe to say that I'd wait until we get a real 3D Blu-Ray of Friday the 13th Part 3, and not have to deal with old school 3D glasses. I've seen the movie in 2D and I already think it's a good movie, and now the next Friday the 13th movie will be the second to be shot in 3D, I think where going to be in for a treat. We don't have to wait long, if you have a Playstation 3, then you'll just need the upcoming firmware update and an HDMI 1.4a cable and a 3DTV and just wait for Paramount to re-release the 3D version of Part 3 on the 3D Blu-Ray, if you don't have the PS3 then hopefully your player can also just accept a firmware update.Avatar (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) [Blu-ray]"
5,Cinematic history now available for home use,"I saw the original 3D theater release. It doesn't get better than that. The home version is limited to the size of your tv screen, the smaller viewing area and glasses provided. You get what you pay for. The 3D effect is stronger in some scenes more than others. This is a classic horror movie and the 3D does make it a different kind of viewing experience. Occasionally a stick like object appears to be in your living space but the bulk of the 3D effect is the image on your screen. The effect is like looking out of a bubble window at a world on the other side. It adds to the creepy nature of the movie. You don't normally get this kind of viewing experience watching tv, digital or HD. That's what makes it special."
4,More ways to kill...,"RECAP: Carrie(was that her name?) beheaded Jason's mother, only to be killed in Part II. At the end of part 2, Jason, and his knap-sack, get tricked into thinking that the whore-nee teen who wore his mothers sweater was his mother.(sorta corny & dumb.)Now, we see ourselves in Part 3: the debut of the Hocky Mask. Thanks to a kid with an afro.Part 3 is good. It has a good variety of scenes with a good way of utilizing sharp objects. It is a really cool movie. You should buy it, if you are a Friday the 13th series fan."
2,2 1/2 stars,"Friday the 13th,Part III starts up right where part II ended. Then another group of young adults go to the camp crystal lake area and encounter Jason. The same events happen as in the first two Friday the 13th films. Do take not however this one is where Jason gets his hockey mask!"
1,It's not a real 3D blu-ray,I know it was cheesy and I saw it when I was a kid and thought it was so cool when the spear flew out of the screen and almost hit you in the face - but they used polarized 3D glasses back then even - not these cheap red / blue things that come with the disc. THIS IS NOT A REAL 3D blu-ray and they fail to mention that so forget about playing it on your 3D tv or projector with any real 3D quality. 1 star for deception. Otherwise I would say 2 and a half stars as this IS the Friday the 13th where he gets the mask.
3,Fun but painful!!!,"Purchased the U.S. region free release as unlike in the U.K. it includes the 3-D version of the movie, and has a decent cover art. I also bought the U.S. release of Part 2 and the DVD of ""His name was Jason. I have two regrets. Regret no.1 is that I was stung by customs and excise to the sum of 14. The 2nd is that I will never be able to sit through the whole 3-D version as it is just too painful. It feels like you are always trying to focus or see past something that is kind of obscuring your view. I got such a headache that I had to fast forward through the slower sections to get through it quicker. It was amusing to watch at first, but regretfully I could have saved a packet by getting the U.K. release. WHY DO WE GET SUCH AWFUL COVER ART?"
3,yet another good sequel,"Friday the 13th part 3 originally was a 3-D film when it hit the theaters. I would have liked to have seen it in 3-D but none the less the movie is good. Come Part 3 you can pretty much figure out that there is no continuous story line. Well, that is somewhat typical of slasher films. Friday the 13th doesn't have a continuous story line until Part 4 (aka the Final Chapter). Anyway, on with the review. The two things I like about Part 3 is that it is short-to the point and Jason obtains the one thing that stuck with him for sequels to come...the hockey mask. Plus, viewers might be able to tell the scenes that were supposidly 3-D from the theatrical showing. I really liked the opening music to Part 3 and in my opinion another good theme song didn't come along for the series until Part 6."
4,"""Now we're talking!""","I;d give this movie 5 stars, but I really don't think it was necessary for Jason to show his face. But, he finally has the Hockey mask, and he has the machette this time, too! This is finally a REAL piece of Jason history!"
3,The best in the series,"Another group of horny teens find themselves stalked by axe-wielding murder Jason. The formula for the series is now becoming annoyingly repetive, but this gory shocker does have a few new surprises of its own (especially Jason's variety of weaponary - the spear gun; oh what a treat!). Debut for Jason's hockey mask. Originally screened in 3D.This DVD, like the others in the FRIDAY series limits itself to only a trailer, but like the rest has clear and wonderfully bloody picture and a standard but clean Dolby Mono track. If your a fan of the series, you can't go wrong."
4,Best in the series,I seen this one when it came out back in the early 80's. Although I am not a big fan of the 3D- Friday the 13th part 3 ranks as one of the best of the films in the series IMO. Outshines the frist 2 and the ones that followed. If you only want to buy one DVD in the series- Part 3 is the one you want.
2,"Jason's back, but why?","This film pulls off the tough feat of being senseless, unoriginal and completely derivative of its predecessors while still being mildly entertaining. Despite 2 previous bloodbaths at Camp Crystal Lake (chronicled in the first 2 ""Friday The 13th"" films), yet another group of less attractive but equally sex-crazed teens travel there intent on reopening it. As you probably suspected, that murderous, non-speaking, zombie-like psycho Jason awaits them (he dons his infamous hockey mask for the first time in this installment) and many gory slayings ensue. The shocks work surprisingly well and the killings are as brutal as ever, but of course the finale degenerates yet again into a one-on-one chase between our antagonist and our heroine where, despite all appearances and no matter how hard she tries, he never seems to actually be dead. Ho hum."
3,better than the first and second,"i was surprised when i saw this movie. i thought it would be lame like the first one but it wasnt at all.this movie had cool killings! bad acting though.but still good.i'll just tell you,dont get the first or second one.this one is where it actually has jason and a hockey mask.in the first one there wasnt even a jason at all.in the second one,jason was the killer,but had a cloth over his face instead of a hockey mask which wasnt scary.this one,is scary.get it."
3,DECENT,"Ive recently started to collect the friday the 13th series and nightmare on elm street and i have seen all the friday the 13th movies in the past and some i own on video- i just got this one on dvd and i give it 3 stars. The acting isnt that great , the plot is the same thing as the first 2 basically and in this movie jason finally gets his mask. The movie is also in (3d) but it dosent effect anything diffrently. This movie is basically same old same old -jason killing campers and some stupid motorcycle gang- thats the only part of movie that annoyed me. I would buy this is if your a big fan of friday the 13th series. I just bought part 4 and 6 and they will be arriving shortly - its been a long time since i watched those ones so i dont really remember them to good , i just hope they are better than this one. I already own friday the 13th part 1 and jason x. I think part one is very good and jason x is pretty good. The nightmare on elm street series is very good , i also recomend that."
2,Friday the 3rd time around!,"Just when you thought Jason was dead....well he's not in the sequel that started him wearing that creepy hockey mask for the rest of the series.Part 3 is at times slow and annoying ,but the rest of the 3-D effects from the theaters are some points hilarious on video."
2,Why put this one in the toilet?,"Jason's back and hunts down a group of teens on vacation near the sight of the murders from the first two. Not much on plot, but then, were the first two? Some qualities that would set it higher than the first two but too many toilet scenes hold it back."
4,GORE to the masses!,"The slasher film makes its mark in 1980 bringing ""Friday The 13th"" to the masses. With gore galore, a mysterious maniac hacksup camp counselors at Camp Crystal Lake and the level-headed public gobbles it up at the box office. ""Friday The 13th"" was the beginning of the slasher flick empire. The unknowing counselors prepare the camp for summer, all the while beingstalked by an unseen predator. We know that most of them will die, we just don't know when or more importantly, how. This makes for a thrill ride of suspense and gore. Like it or not, ""Friday The 13th"" was a milestone. Every mass-produced slasher film made since can be traced back to this original blockbuster. JASON LIVES!"
4,One of my favorites so far,"This movies great fun and I highly recommend it to anyone who like Jason Voorhees Flicks and Horror Movies in general. The plot is that 8 friends Chris, Rick, Vera, Shelly, Andy, Debbie, Chuck, and Chili, go to a farm in the woods near Crystal Lake for the weekend for fun in the sun, Smoking Weed, and doing it with each other. Unfortunatly, only the day before madman Jason Voorhees (who was thought dead) killed 10 counslers at a traing camp, escaped and has now killed a shopkeeper and hid wife. Now Jason is stalking/killing the 8 friends and 3 bikers on the farm one by one. Who will survive and who will get random limbs choped off? As I said this film is lots of fun which all Slasher/Horror/Jason Voorhees Movie Fans should watch and enjoy.Highly Recommended!"
3,straight...but not groundbreaking,"steve miner actually made an attempt at making a half decent film with this one. this is the first one where jason gets his mask. the ending of this film leaves one rather confused and kind of takes away from the film. had this film been released on the video format in 3-D, this film would've been better but i guess that us viewers will just have to use our imaginations for that...this one was ok...nothing more"
3,Jason finally wairs a hockey mask,"Jason has toatally always bean known as the hockey masked murderer from the Friday The 13th series, and this is the one that started it all."
2,Not done right!,"OK, here is the bottom line with this product. It is poorly done! They didn't put any of the cool extras on here, banking on the 3D effect being the main drive, and the 3D here stinks. Nowadays, with the advancements in 3D, this cardboard crap is just bad. I too was really looking forward to finally seeing this again in 3D, because I saw it in the movies back when, but to see it this way isn't worth it. The opening credits, for some reason are in 2D. The credits popping out are some of the best 3D effects in the movie and they left it in 2D. The entire movie has heavy duty ghosting throughout. 20 minutes in and you have a major headache. And remember, this disc offers NOTHING except the 3D version of the film. I hear the Blu ray release has ghosting problems as well. Also, the movie is very grainy. Don't buy the same movie 10 times and make these people even more rich than they already are. When they get it right, they'll get the money."
2,friday the 13th part 3 in 3d,"i just got my copy of this movie today, and the 3d is really bad, i dont no why they cant improve on the 3d going to dvd, iwas really excited to watch this movie again as i remember and the 3d effects cant get focused at all, if they took the time and redid this for dvd it could be a lot better, dvd version 2 stars, movie version 5 stars, come on paramount pictures do a better job, after all these years waiting for the 3d version you could have done much better than this, my last words are it is a waste of money to buy, stick with the 2d version much better"
3,Why did this have to be so disapointing?,"I am probably the greatest fan of the Friday series, But this one was pretty sad. The ""effects"" when the boyfriend's head is squished could be done better by a five year old. The killing scenes are lame, but there is gore aplenty, and its Jason, so it deserves three stars, but no more."
3,He's Back,"Jason gets up, after being injured at the end of Part 2 and this time, hunts down a group of teens on vacation. About as much plot as the first two, give or take. Very entertaining (except for a few unenjoyable toilet scenes), and keeps you in suspense all the way through. The best so far."
3,A Few Good Moments,"It's probably the best of the series' sequels, due to some scenes that are pretty shocking, especially the ending, and its neat 3-D effects, but overall, nothing else is very imaginitive and it has basically the same plot as all the others."
1,3D works fine,"The 3D on this movie work just fine. Its the original red/blue 3D, so watch it on a TV not a computer and from at least 10 feet. I watched it on a 32"" screen from 12' and the only effects that had a double vision were the snake and wooden pole in the first few minutes. The opening credits are shown in 3D but the old stock from part II is in 2D. This movie is much better in 3D than 2D as much of the film is focused on the visuals that can only be seen with the red/blue glasses. The only reason why I rate this a 1 star is that people tend to read the low reviews and make their decision, all of which say the 3D doesn't work. It does but if you sit too close or have a sight problem, like color blind or such it won't work correctly. This movie is well worth the money if you like the series."
5,A Great Sequel,I really enjoyed this one. This is the one where Jason get's his hockey mask which is the trademark of the series. I found this very entertaining and fun to watch.
3,Not the best in the series but still good.,"This one is not the best in the series but it is still good. Friends go to Camp Crystal Lake and Ignor the death cures again. They get killed off one by one by Jason. This one is remembered by because of the 3D effects and the hockey mask he gets.Rated R for violence, a sex scene(but you only see her bare feet touching his bare feet as they do it), and some language. Any Jason fan should check it out!"
3,This Movie Rocks,"Only I have To say is ....... This is the best movie in the world the murderes are perfect ( except with the eye ) if you are wondering what friday the 13th movie you want to buy this is the one ( the sequels often sucks ) if you love cool kills then this is the answer chucky,michael myers,hannibal,norman bates,ghostface,freddy krueger,leatherface are just a babys JASON is the god so if you are a horror fan buy the friday the 13th films (exspecially 1,3,6) i would give this movie 100 stars if that were available"
4,FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3,"FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3 was the first film in the whole series where Jason Vorhees picked up the hockey mask that he would wear for the rest of the series (that is of course, after he kills the guy who was wearing it). This installment has a group of teenagers who go to a farmhouse in the country to party for the weekend, and the farmhouse just happens to be located down the road from Camp Crystal Lake, which means that the teenagers will eventually meet there death at the hands of our mutant maniac Jason. A welcome sense of humor helps this third entry in the series."
4,This movie ROCKS!,"Jason comes back again and kills a bunch of teens just having fun on vacation. The same tired old thing keeps getting better every time we see it. A great flick. Even though it's not in 3-D, the effects are still REALLY cool. Popcorn, Pepsi and Pizza."
3,Thankfully a few improvements made since Part2.,"Though this film is a virtual re-make of its predecessor (teenagers near Camp Crystal Lake get slaughtered one by one) it is at least a step in the right direction for this series. Jason is much more of an intimidating figure than before and there are at least some interesting characters besides the stereotype dozy teenagers. Shelley is a humorously nerdy practical-joker, and the scenes involving him and the bike gang make essential viewing.The film is also in 3-D, which means that all you need is a pair of those red-green glasses and before you know it there'll be baseball bats, knives, severed eyeballs and even Jason himself coming straight out of the TV screen.Don't expect much of a plot, but it's certainly much more worthwhile than most of the early Friday the 13th films."
4,Eye-popping 3D,"The first of the series in which Jason wears his now famous ice-hockey mask, and also one which has some great 3D sequences. Though the plot is similar to Parts 1 and 2 and the ending is just a rip-off of the original, the film has much more interesting characters, refreshingly new situations and is on the whole far more enjoyable. Jason himself is also a much more intimidating figure than previously. A must-see for fans of the series and anyone who likes horror in general."
5,Friday The 13th Part 3 (3D) 1982,"Jason Returns and in this one he gets his hockey mask thanks to some poor prankster kid with a jewfro, the movie gets more violent and you can tell it's not the same place as Part 1(New Jersey Locales) this time they thought that no one would notice the new location but it's okay the movie despite being part 3 does not disappoint.Same Jason different story and more Kids to slash and even a hippie or two."
5,The best of the series,"I totally adore the Friday the 13th movies. I've been watching them since I was a kid. They are filled with eerie suspense and lots of gore and some of the movies contain good tunes (Alice Cooper.) This one however, seems to stick with me the most. It's my personal favorite of the bunch. Jason gets the hockey mask for the 1st time in this movie. The kills are REALLY good and OMG at the end, ewwwww. Love it!!"
5,Brilliant,"Loved this sequel, once I started watching, I couldn't stop. The characters are origional and really likeable, there is a lot of suspence and the death scenes are pretty good, too. Also this is the movie where Jason dones his famous hockey mask.There's not much to say about the plot as it's almost identical to parts 1 and 2, although a small gang of bikers follow the teens to camp (but, of course, Jason is around so they don't last long...)I thought that the chase scene at the end between Jason and The Last Girl was suspencefull and very well done.Great movie, especially considering it is a sequel. Highly reccomended."
2,"For a ""Friday"" film it's okay....","...but alone, It's bad. But then again, all ""Friday the 13th"" films are pretty bad, but okay for slashers. This film **really** deserves one star. This one features a cool disco theme-song, and the hockey-mask makes it's first appearence. Reccomended for fans of slashers."
2,Unsatisfactory!,"wake me up when this bore of a movie has end. This film is past ridiculous. The movie is about stupid teens who get slaughtered. Why would anyone be impressed by that? Plus there is no point to making this movie. Furthermore, There is hardly a storyline and the acting is horrible."
3,Could be worse....soughta,"Ok, I'll be honest i actually did enjoy this movie as I did all the other ""Friday"" films (minus ""A New Beginning""). This is the film that Jason becomes ""whole"" with his trademark hockey mask (but I still think the Michael Myers mask is the best one...at least in the first Halloween). But you have to admit that this film at least tried to continue on with the previous two films but they can only come up with so many original consepts for the Friday films that it just started falling flat...1 and 2 connected perfectly, 3 tried to connect and did moderately along with 4 but after that...well you know the deal...~AnT~"
3,One Mean Goalie...,"The third installment is the one ""Friday"" fans remember the most, because this is where Jason gets his trademark hockey mask. a group of teenagers decide to spend the weekend at one of there parents' summer cabin, that is right adjacent to... yup, you guessed it, Crystal Lake Campgrounds. This is the first ""Friday"" film that I saw (in 1984...on VHS...as a new release...I feel soooo old, right now) & its still one of my favorites.Dana Kimmell, who plays Chris, is married w/ kids & has a strong Mormon background. She hasn't done any sort of acting since 1990 but, she might return to acting in the future. Paul Kratka, who plays Rick, practices Chiropratics in California (source - www.fridaythe13thfilms.com).As for the DVD, there isn't much hope. 2.0 Dolby Digital with no special features (""Paramount Home Video"" knows its going make money off the strong fan base to these films, so, the studio threw the films out to the public for a quick buck. Thanks for almost nothing)."
5,JASON RULES THE WOODS...,"Out of all the Friday the 13th movies I love this one the best in my opinon this one gets 10 stars because it was so ... funny. And Jason was such a great actor for what went on, I just love how the whole thing was done, and the actor Kane Hodder rocks big time in this one it is his best performance in my opinon they should put him in the Jason vs Freddy movie because he is the best Jason for the part...I love the screams in it too those were the best ones. And I'm not the only one who says that too there are others,like a friend of mine her and I are big fans.Jason Rules The Woods!!!!"
2,3D isn't very good,"In some parts of this movie the 3D is ok, but others show some bad ghosting. They obviously didn't take the time to do it scene-by-scene to synchronize the two colors better.The movie itself is pretty good though. It's one of the better ones in the series IMO."
3,Friday the 13th 3-D,"It wasn't bad for an old movie, but could have been better with blu ray and newer 3-D technology. Which possibly could have eliminated some of the ghosting and better color presentation."
3,Better than first two but still not as good as a first class horror movie!,"This part was the most underrated in first three. and better than first two. In this part Jason found his famous mask and became Jason that most of us know! First part honestly was ridiculous. second part was better but not scary at all, but this part had some real horror scenes. It was a better try than first two but still not as good as first class horror movies. Most of murder scenes were good specially when Jason split up that boy into two parts I reallt got excited! but Killing Rick by pressing his skull although was good at concept but was fair in production. Jumping out one of his eyes from a soft plastic face was more like some of that games in play houses! Nowadays they make every thing they imagine with CG, natural and beleavable! but in old movies I think they should have not created scenes that they couldn't made them perfect!Anyway, in my opinion this was the part that real Firday the 13th series has begun!"
2,"'F13 Part III' will satisfy fans, but...","Friday the 13th Part III: 3D (1982) Dana Kimmell, Paul Kratka, Richard Brooker, Nick Savage, Rachel Howard, David Katims, Larry Zerner, Tracie Savage, D: Steve Miner.Horror fans won't be too disappointed with this third atrocity that's more of a remake of F13-originally presented in pointless 3-D. The anemic plot is again at Crystal Lake where those gosh-darn teenagers don't know any better: sex equals death! Better than Part II, this sequel has some bothersome characters you want to be killed at once, but the infamous hockey-goalie mask worn by Jason memorably shows up in this one. Not bad but unintentional laughs don't help. Look for Miner as a newscaster (if you care).Running Time: 96 minutes and rated R for gore/violence, brief nudity and language."
2,good enough i guess,"friday the 13th part 3 wasnt the worst flick i ever seen but was not great either.this film has its strong parts through its great kills.jason is starting to get a little creative this time around.but i wouldnt count this movie as one of the major sequels in the series.i mean , the lake is green!!!! come on now. it was beatiful crystal clear in all the others , but green in part 3..lol..that was a little stupid..mrs. voorhees apearing in the movie ,(yawn yawn),now where have i seen that scene before?lol.like i said the kills are good,most of em but the characters are corney ,there are some funny parts though.i guess what made this movie so cool was that jason got the mask for the 1st time in THIS one."
3,Jason in 3D on DVD at last...and the movie is bloody good !,Part 3 of Friday the 13th - this is also a good offering as were parts 1 and 2. I have always thought the first 3 were really the best & got worse after Part 3. More dumb teenagers go to Camp Crystal Lake and Jason hacks them all off one by one. There is no one to root for but Jason. Characters are goofy or just dumb. The suspense/scary moments were plentiful. Gore and nudity as usual. There is even a shower sequence (a nod to Psycho ?)The DVD can be seen in 2D and 3D. So far I watched it in 2D - the 2D print was kind of grainy for the first 18 minutes but was ok from there.When I see it in 3D ill add to my review...so right at this moment I can say this film is still part of the good early ones and recommended to any Friday the 13th fans.
3,It's More Like 2 1/2 D,"First off, this is not so much a review of Friday the 13th Part 3, but a review of the 3D aspect of this particular release.Most of the 3-D, involving the characters themselves, is blurry. The main 3-D gigs in the film are intact and do come off the screen. Some of these gigs include: the laundry stick, the snake, the wallet, the baseball bat, the spear, the grass in the foreground when Chris and Debbie walk through the grass, and the yo-yo. Each of those gigs came off the screen enhancing the experience of this film.However, throughout the film, you can clearly see clear bubble like structures around the characters most of the time, which might give you a head ache.This release is far from perfect, but it is very fun to watch the gigs I have listed above in their 3D form as they are in your face."
1,How can people enjoy this movie?,"When i first heard about this movie, people where saying ""Oh, its so cool! Oh, its awesome."" So, when i got my hands in it, i was soooooo dissapointed: Bad actors/actresses, dumb 3D effects, many logic and acting errors, and a extremly bad storyline. I concider myself a fan of these movies, but this movie is the stupidest movie in the whole serie (except for part 5: A New Beginning). Some newbie horror fans might enjoy this movie, but for the rest of us: KEEP AWAY!"
1,Don't Buy This For The 3D Version!!,"I bought this for the 3D version and can't describe how awful the color looks. I watched ten minutes before I had to shut it off. If I could rate it lower I would.I have no problem with the 2D version. For me this movie falls into the ""It's so bad it's good"" category. When Rick and Jason ""meet"" it's truly and eye catching moment."
2,"""Releases 2/24/09""","This dvd has already been released on blu-ray in the UK, and as it says above, will not be released HERE in the states until Feb 24th. The box pictured above is the UK addition, not the one that is apparently to be coming out. Deluxe versions of this on regular dvd have been released this week, including 2 pairs of 3D glasses, as this was of course origially shown in 3D in theaters. Personally, I would not preorder this blu-ray without knowing if it will be 3D, and packaged with the glasses. Will the 3D even come across in a home theater? I don't know but can't wait to find out! Otherwise it could be like watching Jaws 3 on tv, really bad! The US release of this blu-ray is news to me, so i'm waiting on more info..."
2,Noticeable Improvements,"For once the makers of this mediocre film series, at best, decides to put aside gore for scare. Although there are not many scares, it is still a step up from the usual gorefest that these films glorify. GRADE: C"
2,3 d or not ?,"hi , i just whached spy kid 3 3d it was great .. the 3d was great .. i cant not say that about friday the 13 th part 3 in 3d ..it was only good in the theater.. if you like 3d you would like spy kids 3 long live digtial 3-D ..."
3,Fub to watch in 3d format,"The story really did not make sense and it was saturday the 14th 1982 I guess. The 3d was pretty awsome for the time and this is film where Jason get his hockey mask. as I said story line really suck as must of jason type films. Nevertheless, the 3d is awsome and it would be great to see it on big screen again. Horror movies never should try to explain itself, but they damage the film more."
2,and the point of this movie is...?,"First of all, this movie had absolutely no real plot. A few of the characters were bearable (Shelley) but others (Kimmel's character for example) was just ANNOYING.Another thing I noticed was on the back of the case for this movie, in the overview it says that ""Another group of unsuspecting camp counselors..."" Ok, none of them were camp counselors and the setting was nowhere near anything even resembling a camp."
3,Disappointing but perhaps not surprising,"Incredibly beautiful sounding, lush and perfectly vocalized. Unfortunately, it has little to do with the essence of this music, despite its accuracy and vast soundstage. While it's not a truckdriver's interpretation, its interpretative value is modest, at best."
2,Save your time and money,"Recorded in 1998, this is one of the poorest videos I have viewed in the last 20 years. I have VHS tapes with better image and sound quality. The audio is terrible - many glitches and sudden shifts from one song to another. There is no introduction and no break or interlude between the two bands. Through the entire video a HUGE ""LIVE"" banner displays on the screen. Save your money, or spend it on ""Live at Red Rocks"" or ""Live from Albert Hall."" The six songs (2 Yes and 4 Moodies)were at best an amateur production and a professional rip-off."
5,What a FANTASTIC book!,"WOW! This book was incredible. Using the techniques suggested in this book, I find that I am able to make the most of my day. I can finally work to my full potential!! It is very easy to follow. Finally a book that gives step-by-step directions to acheive personal excellence!!!"
5,The Boat of Dreams: A Christmas Story,"This is a little gem of a book, for all ages. It reminds us of what Christmas should be all about: not shopping, but of love, kindness and faith. There's lots of magic, humor and drama, too, with children flying through the sky in Santa's lobster boat-sleigh, a mean landlord trying to evict the family, a father away at war, and neighbors who at first covet the missing father's particularly beautiful lobster boat and in the end find the true spirit of Christmas in their hearts. The scenes and characters are beautifully evoked and drawn. And it shows the impressive breadth of this author known for his meticulously researched books on bio-terrorism."
4,Nice comfortable night gown,"I bought this gown when I bought two others, this one is my favorite one. Its sized right and comfortable."
1,Only for mindless fanatics with too much money,"I love the BNL but this just wasn't worth the money. Don't get me wrong I love their music and I suppose I wanted to ""collect them all"" but this changed my mind about that idea. I'm actually upset that saved up for this. Forget about this import and just save your money for the next album."
2,Not for people outside of the US,I bought this book because of the many positive reviews it has....The majority of sample foods he uses are hard to find outside the US. I wish I knew this befor buying it.
2,Not for the long term,"I read this book and quickly dismissed it as yet another extreme diet book. You can follow the diet and lose weight, as you can with any starvation diet, but it is not good for the long run and for improving health. There are better thought out and balance vegan diet books out there, that make it possible for a life long change and weight loss."
1,It didn't help,Didnt think this book help at all.would not recommend it?i found it very repiticios?i don't think it is very easy to follow
1,Don't buy this book if you have kids.....,unless you want to prepare two meals at each meal time. I can see myself offering my 10 year old beans and sprouts for dinner--NOT!!!
5,McDougall Program for Maximum Weight Loss,"It surely has been awhile since I purchased this, and amazon is just now asking me to review it? Let me say that I definitely ascribe to the McDougall's wellness regime, if not their politics. I have used this book over and over - and keep coming back to it as needed - and highly recommend it."
3,Good stuff but some of the selling is a little over the top,"The main problem I have with it is this; you're constantly being sold by the author on the ""McDougall Program for Maximum Weight Loss"" all the way through. I already bought your book, you don't need to keep trying to sell it. That said there is a lot good advice backed up with solid evidence to support it. You could do a lot worse than to follow this plan. Though, I doubt if it is for everyone as the book claims. Not everyone could stick to it."
3,"Great, if you are willing to be a quirky vegan...","Being a vegan is already considered kind of quirky. Add to that the fact that Dr M says to avoid things like carrots and soy products. Too strict for my taste. However, veganism is an incredibly healthy way to eat, and this diet works... if you can do it."
3,The McDougall Program for Maximum Weight Loss,"I am finding this program extremely difficult. I feel deprived, have tons of cravings and just moody. I have been doing it for 3 weeks now and those feelings have not subsided. My husband on the other hand is not having any problems with it."
4,Stricter Vegan,"The book explains many things that I did not know. I like the stricter diet for loosing, but found some of the ingredients repetitious. So, like the book suggest, I improvise with different allowable items. Being stricter, I found the diet is easier to stay on and I am satisfied. If you feel like cheating, I suggest for you to eat another piece of fruit, (instead of only two, like the book says.) L.Dowen"
2,Just plain bad,"Incredibly boring, repetitive and unimaginative sludgy thumping EBM. Every song is exactly (EXACTLY) the same, with the same rhythm and approximately the same lyrics. I would admire Funker Vogt's work as a single military concept album (the uniformity of music fits the theme), but they keep churning out the exact same stuff on every single disc.They are essentially a one-trick band. I actually quite like some of their remixes (they've done particularly good work with Velvet Acid Christ and Front Line Assembly), but their original work is just plain bad. If you're looking for angry and hard-pounding stuff that actually has some art to it, check out Suicide Commando's industrial / EBM or Combichrist's grinding electro."
1,"Synths improved, Lyrics grew worse","A trend with Funker Vogt is definitly that the music sounds better as the band progresses. From ""Thanks For Nothing"" to ""We Came to Kill"" to ""Execution Tracks."" But, the lyrics get worse.Even keeping in mind these guys aren't native English speakers, you can't help but chuckle at some of the lyrics -- and the entire song in the case of ""Shaven.""This album is definitly not what you'd want to buy if you're interested in lyrics, but then Funker Vogt isn't the best band when it comes to lyrics to begin with. Most of the songs simply blend together, so there isn't much variety in the sound either. However, the music is good and definitly would work on a dancefloor -- just don't pay much attention to the lyrics."
5,Dance Groove For The Future War Generation,"Simpley the best album I've bought within the Trance Electronica genre. If there ever was to be a movie made based on my sci-fi novel ""Amerikkka Part Two"", I simply would have to have ""Fortunes Of War"" as part of the soundtrack. Come to think of it, Funker Vogt should just do all of the music.True the subject matter within all the tracks are all on future war and/or dystopia ( unlike say FV's ""We Came To Kill"" album), but hell....the more the merrier. And the Trance is dancable too, unlike say Paul Oakenfold's ""Cheese Trance"" or some the other more loungy Trance performers. Over all 5 stars."
4,ferocious music. goes straight for the jugular.,"Wow. Loud. From a scale of one to ten, this CD should be played at eleven.However, do NOT buy this CD if you are looking for anything more than than stomping music and screaming about war, cuz you're not gonna get it. What you will get are thunderous beats, growled vocals, and all that anger that gives industrial music such a wonderfull sound. It really doesn't get much more intense. Funker Vogt doesn't screw around. The songs are ruminations about pain, death, war, etc. Basicaly what most other industrial bands sing about. They don't push it to the limits that Funker Vogt does, though. This is about the limit at which one can still be taken seriously. Much more and they delve into the realm of the charicature. Luckily Funker Vogt knows just where to stop."
5,"After a year and a half, this album is still my most played","Simply put, I've always had a craving for fast and pounding synth songs. I picked up Execution Tracks after reading about FunkerVogt and hearing a partial track on a German industrial/gothic website. So, I ordered the album and was instantly consumed by ""International Killer"", ""Tragic Hero"", and ""Shaven"". The only song I ever tended to skip was ""Fortunes of War"", because the volume drops dramatically after ""International Killer"" and seems drab in comparison. I had a hard time finding any industrial bands to compete with this FV album. After a year and a half, I still love driving with this album blasting in my car. If you yearn for synth sound as much as I do, this album is a must-have! =)"
5,The best episode in the TV series,This video was the best lodoss ar i've ever seen! How Ashram returns and the problems of little Neese make it an excellent plot.
5,Really good tea!!,"Bought this monstrous KILO of tea for my dad. When i got home two months later it was almost gone. Seriously its so much tea for so little money. The tea is strong, the rose hips aren't overwhelming and complement the tea very nicely to give a really nice rosy aftertaste. If you like strong black tea, and with a nice floral taste, then definitely try this tea. great deal for the amount and quality of this tea. would highly recommend."
2,Not what I though,I enjoyed the essays that dealt with his life and his experiences in the theatre. The politically based essays aren't anything that I am interested in.
5,A Must Have Collection,"I rarely write comments about books but this is a welcome exception. A beautifully written, thoughtful collection of short stories. With quiet grace the author touches on deeply felt and experienced life issues. As a writer and an obsessive reader I must say this is the best book I have read in a long time. I highly recommend it."
4,extremly rugged light,"i bought this light 4-5 years ago, i use it everyday sometimes many times a day or for a few hours straight, i have used it as a hammer many times, its very water proof it gets very greasy, i use it for working on cars then i just wash it off, its totally sealed, putting it in a bucket of water no water gets inside the light. my light is very used and abused but still works perfect. i wish it was brighter but quality i would give a 4.8"
4,It's a great little light.,"It makes a really bright spot, which is what I wanted. Also it's small and compact."
2,"Cheap, Poor Design",This is a poorly constructed flashlight. The beam is hard to control and casts a vivid rainbow at anything you point it at. Those $3.00 bargain LED's run circles around this piece of junk. The lens even looks awful. Stay away.
4,Great flashlight,"This is a great flashlight.Strength: durablea aluminum body, bright, small, belt holster, seemingly eternal battery life...weakness: the beam is too narrow-focused, a bit heavyOverall solid and dependable flishlight."
5,The Fairies Want to Talk to Everyone,This is one of my favorite decks. When I feel down and confused about my life purpose this deck always finds a way to deliver messages to me that I can easily understand. I think the fairies want to help and talk to everyone and this deck is a great way to get answers without having to pay someone...You can do it yourself! Great deck for beginners and advanced oracle card readers!
4,Beautiful Cards,I bought this deck for my self as a graduation present. I love them very much but had a hard time learning to use them at first. I went and got the book but found that didn't help much either. I am getting better readings with more practice. So don't give up after a little confusion. I am glad I didn't.
3,Healing the fairies,I really wanted to love these and I do think the design is beautiful. The problem I have with them is the cheap paper they are printed on. When I use them pieces of paper sheer off and leave a huge mess.
5,Healng with the Fairies card deck,Absoultely fantastic. It's amazing and almost scary how accurate and fulfilling the readings are. I recommend them to anyone who is open to believing. They do work really well with Healing with the Angels Oracle Cards.
5,Simple and Quick,"My husband was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes last year. It was a shock and I went crazy buying cookbooks on Amazon to help me deal with his new dietary requirements.This cookbook is awesome. I've been working my way through it and have found the recipes simple (not a huge laundry list of ingredients) and sophisticated. On occasion they need a little salt (haven't come across a recipe that asks for salt yet!).My husband has been very pleased with everything I've done out of this one and always asks - what's next? Can we try something new out of that 30 minute book?Buy it - for the price - it's totally worth it.(by the way, there is nothing exotic about pumpkin seeds, peanut oil and oyster sauce - unless you live in a cave)."
5,An adult view,"I have been a fan of fantasy and science fiction for all of my life. I stumbled upon this series and have enjoyed each of the books. As you progress with Bobby from book to book it hooks you into waiting for his next journal. The books are written for teens, but adults can enjoy them as well. The moderation is well done and consistent between each of the books so no different voices to piece together for the same character. I've found that as each book in the series builds upon each other, the storyline keeps getting better. I would recommend this series to both young adults and adults. As good does not always win in the books, as in real life, the storyline of perseverance and making hard choices parallels decisions that our youth face in their lives. A good series for anyone to read."
5,Pinkpanther's* Cool Pendragon revvvvview,"Black Water is a fantastic story and fans of the other four books will love this book!This time, Bobby Pendragon confidently heads off to the jungle habitats of Eelong. But bad things are happening to Gunny, Courtney, Mark, and Bobby. Will Bobby fail on this territory as he did the last territory? Is the council planning to destroy? This is a must-read book. It seems like Alla (the god of all things) is weakening, and Saint Dane is getting power. Will this be a disaster? I liked this book because the story was usually in the midst of an attack or a tense dialoug."
4,Amazing!,"The fifth installment in the Pendragon series was an amazing edition. This could be my new favorite installment, shunning out the never war as number one. MacHale goes farther into the fantasy area in this book (these books are a cross between sci-fi and fantasy), the territory of Eelong was a lot different than the other territories. ;) The territory is very unique and I congratulate MacHale's imagination. The only problem with the book and why I gave it only four stars was that the plot (though not greatly) resembled the plot of The Lost City of Faar just a little bit too much. But yet, both books are immensely different. And, wow, what an ending; suspenseful, sad,and yet still have you hanging on the edge of your seat waiting eagerly for the sixth book!"
2,Action on every page. It's too much,Hi. I have read this book and was very disappointed. On every page it was the same: 'Oh No! Were not going to make it!' and then 'Phew we made it!' I got very bored by the middle of the book because I always knew what was going to happen. I can only hope the next pendragon book is not as bad.
5,fact not fiction,"Pleased as punch with this book. It is clear, concise and very informative in all aspects of what you want to know about magical notions and potions."
2,Noisiest laptop I have ever heard,"It was very disappointing when I first got the Compaq Presario from Frys Electronics. It was extremely noisy. And this noise from the fans never turns off. Each time when I turn on the computer, I cannot wait to finish my work and turn it off to gain my peace back. However, my husband liked the fast processor and the multifuntion capabilities. Therefore, I did not return it back to the store right away. Unfortunately, when I try to burn a CD for the first time with the preinstall software, the CD writer broke. Now, it is too late to return to the store. I really regret buying it."
4,Love these little spatulas,"These little spatulas are wonderful for getting fudge, cornbread, etc. out of the pans with no crumbling, or pieces breaking off because the spatula is too big!They are not terribly heat resistant, however, have one the is now rippled and not exactly sure why."
2,Short and purely written,"I expected much more from this book. First part is exaggerated and unrealistic. And second part is so short that there are no characters, no emotions, and no sex scenes as well. Very inexplicit language, no plot and no fantasy. Total waist and bore."
3,"Good, but Not Great","After hearing so much about this book, I, frankly, was disappointed.The concept is good, even grand, and the book follows the idea--looking back at well known parables through the eyes and perspective of a little known person in the story. But it just doesn't deliver the power and impact that its ""buzz"" said it did.Like many such books written by ministers, it needed an editor, somebody to keep it sharp and moving. At times it read more like a sermon. Needed to be written tighter and the idea flow moving faster. Needed to be told and written in a more crip manner.His points, most of them good, all of them good actually, got lost in the words. And that's unfortunate."
4,Using this for Small Group Bible Study,Our Small Group is using this book for our Bible Study through the Summer. It's a nice alternative look at familar Bible stories.
4,An easy read and study,"This book offers an easy read and a great study. The book allows you to think of other perspectives, and is great at breaking the uniformite so many were raised to follow."
3,Creative sermon spark-ers,"Because the parables are stories with the kind of twist that can completely undo our usual ways of living our lives, I appreciated Pastor Kalas' attempt to tell us the story of these stories from a fresh angle. The 12 chapters in this volume are basically sermons. This, in fact, is the value of the book. If you are a pastor who has gotten a little too predictable in the way you create messages, this book will help you climb outside the 3 alliterated points box in a thoughtful, application-focused way.Though I didn't find it especially helpful when I was writing my own books on the parables (Parablelife: Living the stories Jesus told in real time - FaithWalk, 2005 and Uprooted: Growing a Parablelife from the Inside Out, scheduled for release in late 2006) in terms of information, I did find inspiration in Kalas' pastoral approach and welcoming tone."
1,Misleading information,Nowhere in your description of this book do you state that it ia a video study. This is very misleading.
3,This product has no graphics,"This product did not have graphics for a karaoke machine, you have to read the lyrics from the booklet that comes with the cd."
4,NICE HOOKS FOR THE CLOSET,Bought 4 of these to use in our closets. They work fine and the price was a little less than the local big box store.
5,Rob hook,Arrived on time. Very easy to install. Beautiful product finish. Will buy this product again if needed. Highly recommend it
4,This is one of her best!,"OK OK the recipes are better in some of the other books. And would Goldy really be have the ability to concentrate in a church committee review board while her fiance is missing? And unfortunately this is one of the shorter books....BUT!! This is truly a gem to read from beginning to end. Being Episcopal myself, I can relate to some of the items that Goldy talks about with her church. Her reaction to a miracle performed at the church, not to mention a certain thing happening to her at a Women's Prayer Group (I won't spoil it), show that Goldy truly is not a one-dimensional character. I guess what really got me in the end was the true love that Goldy showed for Tom by not thinking he just ran off on her. Thank you Dian Davidson! Keep on cooking"
1,a hardly progressing novel focusing on food and church,"i read DYING FOR CHOCOLATE and THE CEREAL MURDERS, both of which i found barely passable, but i wanted to continue in the series anyway. This book was a big disappointment. the mystery barely progresses at all, and suddenly you're hit in the face with the killer. there is way too much focus on the church. i'm not a religious person and i was seriously lost in this book, skimming and even skipping several chapters. i just wanted to know, whodunnit?? but even the solution was unsatisfying, complicated, and left me feeling cheated out of both money and time."
2,What happened to the mysteries?,"I am disappointed in this series. I started with ""Catering to Nobody,"" and have all the others (save the latest--""The Grilling Season""), but I don't think I'm going to be able to finish them.Ms. Mott-Davidson's storytelling talents began to fade with ""Dying for Chocolate,"" paled some more in the overwrought ""The Cereal Killers,"" and then went out altogether on ""The Last Suppers,"" which I didn't finish.At least Grafton and Evanovich's mysteries kept things lively. In each volume, Ms. Mott-Davidson's body count rose to an incredible level and left me with serious doubts about wanting to befriend Goldy and her clan.I'm disappointed and will no recommend this series to my readers, no matter the wonderful recipes. This was a waste of my precious leisure time."
2,Not the best in the series,"I am reading all of the books in this series and this book was rather disappointing, although the monster cinnamon rolls were most excellent. This one was just a bit of a downer and then I missed Tom also. If you don't have to read EVERY book in a series you can skip this one. Janet Evanovich is a funnier, more enjoyable read."
3,The Last Suppers,"Goldy Bear, our lovable caterer, is back and waiting at the church for her bridegroom. When Tom calls her and says he cant make it because their priest has been murdered Goldy is devestated. However, this doesnt end her bad day. Tom has been kidnapped by the murderer and no one knows who that is, or where theyve gone. A cryptic note written by Tom at the scene is all the police and Goldy have to go on to find her fiance before its too late.This is a cute series with great recipes."
5,one of her best,"""The Last Suppers"" was the first one of Diane Mott Davidson's charming Goldy Bear Schulz series that I read, and I rate it as one of her best. As the book opens, Goldy is at the Episcopal church gowned in full wedding splendor, worrying not only about the life-changing ceremony but also about the food for the reception.....A female British mystery author once wrote that, despite whatever else is happening in life, women still have to worry about what to make for dinner! This is certainly true for caterer Goldy, who cooks and serves no matter what or where.The wedding does not happen as planned. The priest is found murdered, and the groom, police officer Tom Schulz, disappears. For much of the action in this book, Goldy is on her own, worrying about Tom, focused on finding him. There is more tension for Goldy in ""The Last Suppers"" than in any of the books of the series, but she carries on and the plot will carry you along with her.Recommended as a page-turner!"
2,"Too Much Food, and Too Much Church","I managed to finish this book, but will definitely not read another one in this series. She's written a passable mystery, but I found too much emphasis on food and church. If you enjoy those two things, you would really love the whole series. The author is VERY knowledgeable about church affairs, and calls on that knowledge to write this series. the emphaszis on food is meant to bring humor into the book. But I don't find that mystery and humor mix very well. Also, I just could never come to like the main character (or any of the other charaters, either, and therefore, never really got pulled into caring about what happened in the books. I had really looked forward to reading one of the books in this series. This was the first one I came across. It was a disappointment for me personally."
4,Cooking and reading - two favorite pastimes,love these books and love trying the recipes. have had many successes with the recipes and enjoy serving new things for friends and family. Would really like knowing these characters in person - well developed personalities that come across through the story. Thks for fun reading and cooking!!
1,too churchy,It will have to be sent back to the kitchen for too much Episcopalian. This was the least fun of her books.
3,I'm being generous with my stars,"...only because I'm a cat person. I totally agree with the other reviews about ""too much food & church"". The thing that really grated on me, however, was the way Goldy kept referring to her fiancee as ""Tom Schulz"", when ""Tom"" would have sufficed for the remainder of the book once his last name had been established. I'll stick with the likes of author Marge Piercy, in future..."
4,Last Suppers,"Although not quite up to some of her better works, I found this to be entertaining, as is always the case with Davidson's books."
1,does not set itself,"I have the analog version of this clock that is supposed to be ""self setting"" It was very cool when I first inserted the batteries, but now with DST dates changing and/or because it does not work as advertised, the clock is wrong every time the DST time changes. I have a feeling if it was really ""linked"" to an atomic clock, it would display the correct time. As is, I have to search on the internet for directions to try to figure out how to reset the thing. It's pretty, but does not do what the packaging said..."
3,NOT THE TURTLES I GREW UP WITH,"I don't see how kids could even like this kind of stuff, but I guess even the turtles had to get in on the christmas spirit. The TMNT should stick to eating pizza and fighting crime because rappin' ain't their thang!"
3,Informative but not succinct,"In additional to basic family, tribal and racial frameworks, the authoress lists in Table 2 on page 35-36 no less than 12 astrological factors reported to co-determine physical appearance, some of them with 'bewares'. No flow chart is included.Although the book conveys much of what many authors have opined on the subject over the centuries, it remains nevertheless inconclusive. A series of blind delineations of physical appearance based only on accurate natal horoscopes would have done much to improve this and could have demonstrated the real skills of Ms Hill in this field.The authoress' drawings do illustrate the text within the framework she explains."
2,looks like it was made at home,What I had read about Judith Hill in her blurbs on her astrology readings led me to believe that she was some professional author and researcher. I get this book and it's a comb-bound book where all the illustrations (by Judith herself) are line drawings of people with the same face! The whole thing is shoddy and amateur and I don't find evidence to back up her credential claims. Astrology needs more professionals and fewer charlatans in our profession.
5,Awesome Unknown Gem,"Fans of Darkwater and Harmony take note,This is guitarist Markus Sigfridssons side progect.This time he uses different players and the singer from Mehida and Daniel Flores on drums.I almost think this stuff is better than the other bands.It has a more heavy gothic progressive sound with soaring melodies.It's beautiful and heavy at the same time.There is a cover of Wisdom Calls by Veni Domine and it sounds great.I can't stop listening to this CD!A must buy if you are a fan of Darkwater and Harmony."
4,Works great,"I've been looking for a replacement u-based tape measure since leaving my last employer 10 year ago, but had trouble remembering the brand or name. I finally stumbled on this ""Rack Ruler"". It seems pretty standard as far as tape measures go. The plastic housing is adequate and the belt clip works just as well as any other tape measure I have used. It slides out and self retracts easily. An interesting bonus is on the back of the extended tape: there are fraction to decimal conversions, ohm's law, etc. While not necessarily relevant to someone who is using the tape measure for its u-based abilities, it is still an added bonus. The one minor issue is that the u measurement labels are in orange and can be difficult to read from a distance. I wish the u-based labels would stand out better from the bold black inch labels."
2,DISAPPOINTED,I HAVE BEEN USING THE PRODUCT ABOUT 45 DAYS. I SEE NO CHANGE IN MY SKIN. THE LOTION IS VERY STICKY. IT WAS RECOMENDED BY MY DERMATOLIGIST. SORRY I WASTED MY MONEY.
4,lotion,"i bought this product by recomendation from my husband's doctor. My husband has diabetes, his feet become dry and irritated, therefor his specialist asked to try the lotion. He applies it several times a week to his feet and skin that is considerably dry. Thank you for the swift action in shipping."
1,Perfume fragrance of the lotion is too strong,"My daughter has eczema and her skin is sensitive. The lotion has too much fragrance. It smelt as if my daughter pured a bottle of perfume over her body. I have been using natural oils,lotions and soaps I have purchased from the health food store. They seem to be doing a good job."
2,"Nice looking, but not really dishwasher safe","One of the reasons I bought this set, was because the description said it was dishwasher safe. Unfortunatelly that was not the case. After one use in dishwasher small rust patches started appearing.I guess producer is aware of potential problems as there was a small instruction supplied with the set that said how to polish in case stains occur."
1,Careful!,This set is very pretty but the edges are very sharp. The utensils are not only uncomfortable to handle but also unsafe.
5,Enchanting,"I saw this show on TV eons ago.It's the story of a sweet little white seal, Kotick, seen as an oddity by his fellows, but definitely not inferior. Because of his aloneness, Kotick sees more around him than the others, and must attempt to save them from seal-hunters.There's a sweet little substory about Kotick's relationship with his father--you'll want to kick Dad at the beginning, and give him a friendly whap on the head at the end.An adorable little cartoon that won't make you throw up! (A rarity, no?)"
5,Very Thorough Research.,Waite does an excellent job of breaking the subject of occult and/or magic into digestible bite size pieces that can be understood by anyone attempting to learn more about this subject as it was originally taught. Well organized and readable.
3,Pleasant Diversion,"This is a pretty good book. I'm not normally into nautical books, but this one was well worth the time. I was bothered initially by the fact that the main character, Jim Leighton, was hired to be a personal fitness trainer for the owner of a boat. I just didn't think that would realistically happen. However, Paul Garrison has a good explanation for it, but you have to wait until the end of the book. What I like is the development of Jim from someone who knows nothing about boats to an experienced sea hand. I'd be willing to read another sea novel by Mr. Garrison."
2,Disappointing,"I loved Fire and Ice and Red Sky at Morning. But I set this book down because the characters were so thin, if not self-absorbed. Frankly, I didn't want to go on the voyage with them, however harrowing it might be.Mr. Garrison, you can do better than this"
3,Hard Work,"Lindberg refers this kit as a ""Skill Level 3""...hmmm...I'd rate it as Skill Level 6 required! I have assembled a few Lindberg kits and they are rough around the edges and the ""Sea Witch"" is no exception. Ill fitting parts...huge amounts of sprue (flashing)...amatuerish instruction guide. So many problems could have been eliminated if Lindberg had cast the hull in one piece. You're going to have to drill...cut...trim...and improvise to get things to work. Though it's a plastic kit forget about the traditional cement...you're going to need cyanoacrylate glue...and lots of it! However...it's difficult to find a plastic sailing ship kit in this scale for this price...and we all know what the wood models cost. If you have the time and the patience...and you enjoy the challenge of a difficult build...this kits for you! Good Luck!"
2,Not what you think,"I have built a few ship models in my time and this one is the worst model I have ever build. (1) the instructions are very poor most of them are in three or four languags.(2) the parts are all broken off so you can't tell what goes where.(3) Most of the sailes have no number at all so you have to guess where they go..This is the first Lindburg model I have built and I can say if will be the last.I'll stick with Revall they still make great model kits.For the money I spent and time I have wasted on this,well it realy waters me off if you know what I mean.Hope yall have better luck than I did.O Ihave built the USS Constitution,the Cutty Sark,and the Flying Cloud.Not my first rodeo.Good Luck."
5,Excellent book,When I was a boy my uncle tryed to teach me Cree...the language of my ancestors. I can only remember his voice. But now there is this dictionary that allows me to find precise meanings for words I dont remember clearly. The book will help keep the traditions of my people alive. an excellent book...highly recomended
4,Item in good shape,This was a Godsend find. I'm of 1/4 Cree decent and my daughter and I are trying to learn our ancient language. All the other sources for this book wanted more than my budget could spare. This source made it possible for us to take another step closer to our native roots. Thank-you.
5,A MUST HEAR !!! TREMENDOUS ORIGINALS...... A SURE PLEASER,"I have played this album over and over in the car and I can't get enough of this great blend of melodies.....the songs make you want to move, to dance to smile!"
5,wonderful product,"received the boiler in a very timely matter. I have used a Zojirushi for many years and I can't live without it. My old one has always worked great. I purchased a new one for my Mom with some upgraded features. Has a timer and 3 temperature levels, works like a ding dong. It is so convenient to have boiling water any time all day. I am a big tea drinker and would tell everyone that this is what you need if you are."
2,Find a better boot,"You get what you pay for, I guess, but I really don't like these boots. They look fine, and the construction (appearance) seems sound; however they are NOT comfortable. I have had several pairs of Skechers sneakers and expected these boots to be comfortable (at least nearly so). Yet the right boot's footbed is clearly not manufactured correctly, as I can barely go an 8 hour workday wearing them. It feels as though there is a hump under my smaller toes. My foot also seems to pronate markedly. The left boot doesn't seem to suffer from the same defect. They also have very ""hard"" cushioning...I can't imagine them being worn in a work environment -requiring- boots.Also I've had the boots less than a month and the laces are starting to fray where they contact the eyelets.I should probably return them as defective, but the extra shipping fee makes that cost prohibitive."
1,Terribly disappointed with both content and appearance,"I was terribly disappointed with both the content of this book, as well as its general appearance. The book itself consisted of mimiographed pages glued together, and the mimeographed picture of the text was very small in relation to the rest of the page.. As far as content, just your average run of the mill esoteric text - lots of conjecture, but no real substance... A general disappointment all around."
4,Tai Chi...good starter video,Good video....like the tempo...not to fast gave time to learn the moves
4,Pregnant woman's dream come true,I bought this for my wife a few weeks ago. She is pregnant and was tossing and turning all night long. Something had to be done. I could not sleep with all the pulling of the covers. She was becoming very disruptive. She actually found this pillow at my behest. Like magic no more tossing and turning from the wife. I can actually sleep. Fellas get this for your lady. It works great and is very comfortable and well constructed.
2,Too difficult to get in and out of bed at night and too hot,"I purchased this item because I was starting to have trouble getting comfortable in bed at night around my second trimester. I found that I was even less comfortable with this pillow than without it. First, I was very very hot wrapped up in this huge pillow, which doesn't breathe, also the pillow case/cover it comes with is kind of itchy. I also found it very difficult to get out of bed when I was wrapped up in the pillow, which is a problem with I'm getting up 4-5 times each night to pee (hey - that happens when you're pregnant) and trying not to wake up my husband who is sleeping next to me.I am sure that for some people this pillow might work great... but I didn't really use it (I think I actually slept with the pillow 1 or 2 nights tops). I'm hoping that I will be able to use it to prop the baby up for nursing once she comes to it isn't a total loss - otherwise I will pass it on to a friend if one every wants one."
3,good overall,my wife said it would be better if the pillow was a little softer. she hasn't complained about anything else.
4,Comfortable but BIG,"It's a great pillow but is does take up a lot of room in bed. If you are sleeping by yourself, it's great but my husband complains that he doesn't have any room becuse of my new giant pillow. Besides that, I love it."
2,Does not work out for me,"This pillow is too big for me ...Although I tried to use it several times for a better sleep, I ended up throwing it away every time.The pillow case also does not feel comfortable.To me, this pillow is a waste of money."
4,Great pillow!,"I bought this pillow around 19 weeks right before I was supposed to stop sleeping on my back. I had been using a body pillow and another pillow behind my back. This worked so much better! It keeps me on my side and I am comfortable. The only reason I am not giving this pillow 5 stars is because the material of the pillow case is a little rough if you are used to sleeping on soft sheets and is a pain to take off of the pillow. Still, a great buy, considering I am usually a stomach sleeper. Oh, and it works fine in a queen bed. I bought this instead of some of the others because I thought they might be too big for a queen.Edit: I am now 37 weeks pregnant and am still loving the pillow. It is the only way I can sleep. I sleep horrible away from it. Honestly, with the exception of bathroom breaks, I sleep pretty darn good considering I am 8 months pregnant. The biggest flaw continues to be the cover...I would suggest buying a second cover right up front."
3,WAAAAY too Big!,"Sadly, I had to return this pillow, as it was Waaaay too big! When I ordered it, I thought it might be too small, not puffy enough, but just the reverse! I might be terrific for some folks, but I found it incredibly hard to move it around, and get into a comfortable position...and I as I am a real tosser and turner, it wouldn't work for me. Also, as I think someone else mentioned, the head pillow part was very rigid, not comfortable. Otherwise it was a great product...very good quality. But not for me."
2,"Great support, as long as you never wash the cover.","This pillow will sure keep you sleeping on your left side and provides limited protection from Hubbie's cold feet. But you might lose sleep when it comes time to changing its cover. The distress of threading a 9-ft cloth condom over a U-shaped pillow with widened ends is enough to put you into labour. It's worse than putting ski boots on a squirming child. C'mon Leacho. Technological advancements like buttons, zippers, and velcro were made to rescue us from designs like these."
2,Not Comfortable,"I bought this pillow when I was 19 weeks pregnant, thinking it would help relieve some hip and back pain I was experiencing. While it's very nice to have something between my legs when I sleep, this pillow is very large and takes up quite a bit of room in the bed. I also found that the part where your head rests is too firm and full. It gives me kinks in my neck. After spending the money and being disappointed, I have switched to a standard pillow between my legs and my regular pillow to sleep on."
2,Makes it hard to swtich sides,I purchased this pillow but ended up returning it because it was a little too flat all around for me. I need more head support. Also I didn't like that if I switched sides I had to turn the whole thing over--it's a bit heavy. I purchased Leachco's back 'n belly pillow instead which I'm happy with.
2,better order a king size bed too!!,"So I thought I would be the good husband and order this for my pregnant wife who was beginning to not be as comfortable sleeping through the night...result, lasted one night. This thing is huge. After she put it on the bed I felt like just getting my pillow and blanket and heading for the couch with my head down, realizing I had probably just kicked myself out of my own bed until the baby comes. She seemed to like it on her trial run before bedtime. It is a really goofy shape, but I guess the folks who made it probably gave it that shape for a reason. Anyway, halfway through the night my wife felt like the thing was strangling and suffocating her. The thing was pitched out of the bed and was banished for good. I guess it is possible that some women might like it, my wife sure wasn't one of them. It was just entirely too big and she didn't like the fact that it really only works if you stay in one position all night."
4,I don't regret the purchase,"First of all, we have a four inch memory foam matress topper that makes our bed pretty soft. I've found myself pulling my regular pillow from under my head to snuggle it because the memory foam is comfortable enough to sleep on without a pillow. I wondered if the Leacho pillow would work better on just the regular matress but have not tested it.I like the pillow, but i only use it on one of my sides. While trying to sleep in one of its recommended positions, it is very comfortable at first, but after maybe 3 or 4 hours I would get out of the position because my neck would be a little cramped because its propped up too high. So essentially i could of gotten a regular body pillow. However I still like the way this one is shaped over standard body pillows because I have a few options on which parts I want to snuggle."
4,great during pregnacy,"My husband bought this pillow for me during the second trimester of my twin pregnancy. At first I thought it was a ""luxury"" item, but after using it the first night, I couldn't sleep without it. The versatile design provides excellent belly and back support, and I don't find the cover scratchy like other reviewers (I'm very picky about how fabrics feel). The only negative thing I can say is that the cover is a bit difficult to get back on after it has been washed. Otherwise, I think it's great and highly recommend it!"
1,inside U part hard on the neck,"we ended up returning the product next day. i must say the only product we have returned on amazon. didn't have any problem with the return, no questions asked!the inside edge (the U part) of the product was very rough on the neck. we thought it might have been the cover on the pillow, so removed, but it made no difference.manufacturer probably took short cuts sewing it, and can easily fix it (they can take cues from the neck supported travel pillows)"
2,Not for the petite,"I ordered this pillow because at 8 months pregnant, I'm having trouble sleeping. The pillow is just too big for me. I'm 5'4"", 140lbs pregnant and the pillow did not cradle me well. Also, the stitching at the top of the pillow, (where the neck and shoulder go) dug into me. I even tried to use the pillow backwards, putting the ""u"" between my legs and sleeping with the my head on the wide end but I'm just too short for it to be comfortable. I think I would try this product again if a petite size came out."
5,Great pillow,This is an awesome pillow. It provides not only comfort but stability against the back which I especially like since I tend to roll on my back while sleeping and after a certain point this is a no-no. It's versatility is supreme. It is like curling up into a cocoon. I'd not only recommend it but got one for my sister and my friend has one too!
4,sleeping better...,"I'm 5 months pregnant and was using a king size pillow between my stomach and legs. I constantly had to move it when I rolled over, and could never get comfortable. When my husband left in the mornings, I'd take his pillow and put it behind my back so I was supported front and back.That's what this pillow does automatically, and it takes up less room. It's two sides together are about equal to the width of a king size pillow. So even though there is support in front of and behind you, you don't take up the whole bed.Now I only roll over when I wake up to go to the bathroom a couple times a night anyway. I'm sleeping great.Cons:a) it did take a few nights for me to figure out how I sleep best with it...be patientb) you are completely separated from your spouse, so you have to move the pillow out of the way for cuddling"
4,"Great pillow, small issue.",This pillow is great and my wife sleeps like a baby for the most part. One issue is that the pillows digs into her shoulder a little more than she would like. she uses another small pillow to cushion the edge. Overall a great buy that made a pregnant woman happy.
4,Good Pillow,This is a pretty good pillow.I am 9 weeks pregnant and find that it is pretty comfortable.It's a bit overstuffed which may be difficult once the belly grows but for now it is helps me from rolling on my back and allows for comfort while sleeping or just lying in bed resting.
4,Excellent Choice for pregnant woman....,"very ergonomic pillow keeps happy my wife, during her pregnancy, but is not recommended if you have a full or queen size mattress."
4,Not too shabby,"I bought this when I was about 18 weeks pregnant and was having a hard time learning to sleep on my side. Just putting a regular pillow behind my back me wasn't stopping me from rolling over, so I knew I needed something that braced on either side of me. It definitely worked, and I didn't find myself getting too hot.This wouldn't stop me from buying it or recommending it to someone else, but some things you should know about the cover.- After a few weeks and a few washing, the cover began to pill quite badly so I needed to use a fabric shaver to clean it up.- When you wash the cover, it is an ABSOLUTE PAIN to get back on. Make sure you have a husband/partner/friend with a very good sense of humor that will help you get the cover back on. It's a two person job.- Some other reviewers said it was scratchy. I didn't find it scratchy...just not as nice as my regular sheets.All in all...a good buy!"
4,Really helps,"I'm 6 months pregnanct and have been using this pillow for about a month now. The difference is quite drastic. I'm sleeping through the night and wake up without back and hip pain, which I had before. I also toss and turn much less. I haven't been able to use the head support because my arms fall asleep. Instead I use the pillow upside down with my feet around the curved part. I wish the longer side was shorter and not take up most of my pillow and the shorter side a bit longer for more even support for when I turn from side to side but overall it's been great."
4,Worth it,"I got this pillow during my pregnancy because I was a stomach sleeper and needed serious help. I loved it, and even my husband liked it - he would use the long side at times, too. My only complaint is that the pillow case is HARD to get back on when you wash it. Not a big enough annoyance not to purchase, though. It's worth every penny. I'm still using it 5 weeks post partum."
4,Great for comfort - definately good buy,"I Purchased this pillow when I was 6 months pregnant and started to have back pain continuously. I did get good sleep but the pillow is shrinking on the sides where we keep our hands and legs and not that stiff after only 2 months of usage. For the price of this pillow, I expected the quality to be much better than this.Other than that, I give good rating to the pillow."
5,Ahhhhhh,"I'm a tall person and I used this in all my pregnancies. I didn't want to give it up, but another friend is pregnant and I guess it's time to pass it on. But my goodness, it was really comfortable and I could use it for many different positions. I even used it at times for nursing. I think that some people don't like it because of their height - it may not work for their body."
2,Cover almost impossible to remove!,"The pillow itself is fine, but the cover is barely removable, even with their instructions. When I called leachco, they refused to send me a replacement cover (even though we actually had to cut it to put it back on). They referred me instead to Walmart, where I purchased it originally, which of course is a lost cause. Dont buy from this brand, if only to teach them a lesson about poor customer service!"
2,Useless,Description for the item said it came with mounting hardware...nope. Just paid $35 for a black frame that won't fit my car.
3,Good information but dated,"The information provided in the book is well presented and thought out, but is dated, particularly in light of the cover title of ""2002 - 2003"". Also, the link in the book for updated information does not work. The ride ratings are helpful in determining which ones might be too scary for children, but do not give you any sense if the ride might induce motion sickness. Overall, is does give a nice overview of Disneyland and surrounding attractions, and provides nice details of the various rides, but purchasers of this book will need a backup source of more current information."
1,"It's useless, don't buy it.","Maybe its name should be ""Complete screen shots of Rational Rose"", it really is.There are absolutely no contents. You cannot use it to learn UML or OOA/D.If you don't have Rational Rose software but want to learn how to use the tool, the book might be somewhat useful since it contains (almost) all the screens Rose has. That's the only usage of this book I can think of."
3,Just 'OK' But Still Fun,"Let's be honest, I bought this for the Finn hat. Unfortunately, the hat runs small--it's probably made for kids not adults haha. But I was able to get it to fit my head decently because I'm a little smaller. As for the DVD, it's nice having an assortment of episodes, but I wish it would have been a single season. I think the value of having a season on DVD would be worth the extra few bucks."
4,Totally Math,"The episodes on the dvd were among my personal favorites of the series. Not only do you get one of the most creative and beautifully animated shows on dvd, but also you receive a Finn hat with the dvd. To me thats pretty radical"
5,awesome,"It arrived fast and good quality, nice mix of episodes on the dvd, Cool Finn hat. I'm British so I had to be play it in a region free Dvd player but works fine :)"
1,No more random assortments!,"I agree with all of the other posters, it is insanity to buy a DVD of a show that is anything other than a season of that show. The hat looks pretty sweet though."
3,Jake Vs Me-Mow Hat Mystery,"Adventure Time: Jake Vs Me-MowI've always enjoyed the series, but--I thought it would be fun to try the hat on as a gag. Did so--fit well. Put it aside and later came back, and... The hat somehow got turned inside out so that it's now unwearable. Both my wife and I can't find any seams; it's a tremendous mystery. Anybody have any clues about this?"
5,adventure time,My son has been asking me for this. I got this for him for Christmas and he can't wait. He loves the show and the hat is a plus. This is a great set.
5,Actually a gift,"This is actually a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loves Adventure Time as much as I do. I think he'll really love this, especially the hat. We're children at heart."
5,ADVENTURE TIME,very good! The Finn Hat is very soft and well made! also a good selection of episodes! Highly recommend for any fan of this series!
5,Classic Rock's most underrated ......................,"This cd, was recorded at XM radio's studio in 2004. It also has 3 bonus tracks, including the new ""deaf, dumb and blind"" The new song is reason enough to buy the cd. It's also climbing up the AC Charts.In addition to the bonus tracks, we're served up some of the best material from Dave's history. The recording is sharp, the band is tight, Dave's vocals are better than ever, his guitar playing (on his RKS guitars)is amazing, and finally the songs are classics. Run, don't walk to add this to your collection. It will remain in your cd player for a long time."
4,Good memories,"I bought this CD after catching one of the cuts on XM Radio. I hadn't really thought about Dave Mason in years. This CD has been a real pleasant suprise, and a good reminder of how involved Dave was with rock music in the late sixties and early seventies. On this live CD, he's in excellent voice, and his guitar playing is still extremely sharp. I would highly recommend this CD to any serious rock fan. It's been playing in my car for a month, and I still enjoy listening."
5,stuff REALLY WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I wanted to wait a good year before doing this review. But here were my numbers before using this product- LDL was 157, total was 222, hdl was 33.. After doing blood work last Friday, 08/26/11, the doc was very surprised, LDL is now 116, total is 167, and hdl is 31. I did eat right, and cut way down on salts and sugars, and exersized 2 times per day, so it wasnt just sitting back and taking these pills and praying. You have to do some extra things also, their is no such thing as ""magic pills""!!! You cant be lazy if you want results!! The HDL is the only puzzling number, since it did decrease a couple of points, but the doc said that was normal with plant sterols, and to ignore it, since ldl was WAY LOW!!"
1,placebo,I tried this product as a cheaper alternative to Benecol on the basis of its literature. During a period of 60 days my LDL went up 30 points. Don't waste your money on this placebo.I returned to Benecol.
5,Effective,Cholest-Off is very effective.. I felt the difference within a week's time. Feel energetic and above all shed a few pounds of weight too :)
5,good for you,"This is a good product, and much easier to get it through Amazon. I usually have to visit several department stores before finding one with this product. Amazon's price is comparable, even with shipping, and no gas expense."
3,cholestOff,"My Cardiologist have been trying to lower my cholesterol for years. I have taken lipitor,crestor Zetia etc for several years. I have to stop taking this statins because of the severe musclecramps I experienced with this drugs. It was so painful and uncontrollable that I stopped taking them. I exercised,lost weight ate the right food and the right amount ,skipped junk food etcbut my cholesterol remained ab0ve 250 mg. I heard a friend who had the same problem who started taking CholestOff so I looked it up on Amazon and lo and behold they have it so I orderedtwo bottles of 240.caplets each. I take i caplet 15 min. before each meal.So far I have not had any side effect from the plant statins and sterols.Amazons price is better than the big chains. For the same price you get more caplets per bottles.I will let you know what the results of my blood chem.after my next three months check up"
2,eat oatmeal!,"Nothing has ever affected the lowering of my cholesterol like eating a bowl of oats each and every morning.In fact, a friend of mine was also instructed to do so by her doctor. She followed his advice but continued to eat fast food lunches regularly. I admonished her that she must eat a healthy diet on top of eating the oats in order to see any lowering in her cholesterol.Six months past and her next check up was due. I was smug in the assurance that her cholesterol was going to be as high as ever. Not so. Despite her ""evil"" ways her cholesterol was 30 points lower simply by adding oatmeal to her diet!Go figure"
3,Not sure,I haven't used the product long enough to really know how effective it is. On the other hand it's a pretty good price. In talking to my doctor he suggested a prescribed medication because these are not evaluated by the medical assocations. It's a choice left to you. I haven't really seen much of anything that really tells me this works.
4,Cholest review,So far I can tell it works because the way I feel when I eat. I feel good after I eat and that tells me it is working. Thank you.
2,bad for stomack,Causes me to have stomach distress. If you can take it with no problem order more. T price is great
1,It didn't work for me.,"My normal cholestrol reading is 270, too high, the doctor put me on Lipitol. My cholestrol came down to 170 but my liver enzymes went up. So doc recommended Cholestoff for a couple of months so he could determine the cause of the enzyme rise. I took the stuff faithfully as prescribed on the bottle, two tablets before every meal. When I returned to the doctor my enzymes were back to normal but so was my cholestrol..270. It did not appear that the Cholestoff made any difference, whatsoever. Perhaps it works for some people, just not for me."
3,GOod,"Product did not help me at the rate I required to get my cholestrol down, but I know people who use it and it worked wonders. I'm sure its just the difference in metabolism."
1,Bogus product,"It doesn't work. I faithfully took this product for a whole year, hoping to decrease a high LDL (my other numbers are great). Then, I had a cholestorol test and saw absolutely NO CHANGE in my numbers. What a huge disappointment. I will never take it again. I am in great shape, work out regularly and eat right, in case you're wondering."
5,Great little skates,I bought these for my boys and they love them. They have a lot of fun learning how to skate and we laugh a lot during the process. I like the way that these skates adjust to the skating level of the skater and also adjust sizes. They seem pretty durable and I don't have any complaints.
2,Horrible design!,"I really like the idea of a roller blade version for my son, so I purchased them for his 3rd birthday. Bad idea! The design is somewhat flawed. My son only wears about a size 8-8 1/2 sneaker, but I had a terrible time putting on the skate. The sneaker was such a tight fit, that it took several minutes just to insert past the opening whilst fully enlarged. I don't even think his sneakers are extra-bulky, they are a medium width Sketcher low top. I consider these a waste of money as my son will not get much use out of them. With each new size sneaker, width gets added, and there is no way a wider sneaker would fit easily into this hard plastic. I suggest the regular toddler skate with 2 straps."
4,Skates,If you buys these skates make sure that you invest in a good helmet and some knee and elbow pads. My little one loves these. They are well made even though they have a very plastic sound to them when they are being used. I was very surprised actually how adjustable they are. The three different settings make it easy to progress your little one. 1 - wheels locked 2- wheels move in a forward direction only 3 - wheels go both forwards and backwards.
3,Did I get a lemon?,"These skates were great last summer when my son was 3. We kept them on Level 2, and he marched around, all proud of himself. Well, this Spring, after a year of ice skating lessons, he was definitely ready for Level 3. But they don't roll. He still basically has to march in them, and can only get a teeny bit of momentum if he goes down a sloped driveway. I am very disappointed, as I thought we would get at least another season out of them. I rated them 3 stars, since I really did like them at age 3, but don't get them for an older child!Nobody else seems to have this problem in any of the reviews, so I do wonder if we just got a bum pair..."
4,Great Product,"These are great. I recently purchased them for my 2-year-old grandson. They fit, they lock, they let him learn. His 5-year-0ld brother also loves them. And they seem durable enough that his 1-year-old brother will probably also get to enjoy them."
1,amazon is a toy ripoff,This costs $20 at Toys r us and in fact went on sale for ten the other day. amazon get a clue!!!
1,kid first skate diego combset,my grandson wanted the diego skateset so me his grandmom order it for himit for it took forever to come and the skate fix on any shoe sneaker or slipper just sock but it was to short for toe to go in the pocket the kneepad or the arm pad fix it was acheaptoy which it costed $19.00the tls was25.in some cahange this skate is one of the worse gift i purchase for x-mas gift
4,Polar S1 Foot Pod,"This product was much easier to set up than I expected. All you have to do is coordinate it with your watch, run a specified distance (I did this on the treadmill so I would know how far I've gone) and the next time you use it it'll tell you how far and how fast you're running.Now, I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because I've noticed a slight difference (roughly 5%) between the distance I've ran and the actual distance, but this could be from my treadmill being off (or from using the treadmill) when I calibrated the foot pod."
4,"Pretty Accurate, drains batteries","The Polar S1 worked as advertised right out of the box! I tested it on more than one track and it has been accurate to within about 25ft. It does look kind of bulky on my shoe but I don't even feel it because its so light. It does go through batteries pretty quickly though, that's why I give it 4 out of 5 stars. But still worth it over all."
1,polar S1 Foot Pod,After owning a Polar S1 Foot Pod previously for 4 years and losing it while running in thick forest.(only lost because i neglected to replace a broken strap)I could not have been more happy and impressed with the accuracy of the unit.To the extent where I ran numerous 100km events and the distance recorded was spot on.So i decided I'd purchase another one.After going through the Run Calibration sequence and also the manual calibration. I repeatedly get incorrect readings of my current speed and also cumulative distance.I have gone through this calibration on numerous occasions where I know the distance and also on a 400m track. I have even bumped up the manual calibration by doing many laps to get the unit to read the correct distance. But still no luck. THE UNIT READS INCORRECT DISTANCE AND SPEED.I'm going to purchase a GPS unit.
4,Very Useful,Very Useful item to add to you Polar watchAccurate and very comfortable.Really recomend it.
3,I didn't know I need an wrist screen,"it was unclear to me that I need to purchase the wrist screen. I thought this had a display. After spending so much, I returned it because I didn't want to spend more."
3,It's okay but probably not critical to your training.,"I bought this to enhance my overall tracking of my progress. First off it is not easy to wear and is quite large. When working it is fine, however it does go through batteries pretty quickly and I am not sure that it is that accurate either. It's an okay product and perhaps I should have thought more about what I wanted from it to start with, but I do not think it is worth the money, there are probably better ones out there."
3,Mmmmmmm. Dairy!,"I have recently started to try my hand at vegetarian french cuisine. So far, I have made the Gnocchi w/ gorgonzola sauce, the Wild Mushroom Ragout and the teleme croque (a french toast grilled cheese). All were really tasty and very hard to make poorly. Things to be aware of:1) Author's descriptions of the dishes are silly2) Does not teach you about the cuisine (for example, what is a Ragout?)Overall, I am really happy with it."
2,poor quality,The jacket was to big and very poor quality. I will be returning this item. I will leave a review about the return process when it's completed.
5,Cloete,"Perfect gift for someone who grew up in Africa. Cloete writes beautifully, describing things and sharing his philosophy of life."
2,Worth the Money,"We recommend this, if you have fallen for Villa's special mystique. Don't make this your first Villa CD - you won't get the right perception. (We started with ""Collection."") Quite a mixture of musical styles & voice - that's good & bad. We LOVE Villa so had to try these: 8 of the 16 are very nice to great. The songs, orchestrations & arrangements are worth it."
3,"Useful, but read Dr Sarno's books first !","This book can be a useful tool for people already familiar with Dr Sarno's approach and books (The Divided Mind and The MindBody Prescription), but I would strongly recommend to read Dr Sarno's books first. BTW, if you happen to read a review here linking this book to yoga and warning Christians against it, don't pay any attention to it. This book is not about yoga at all, and the review in question is... weird, to say the least, and completely misleading. I actually did report about it to Amazon, because it's more spam than review, really."
3,Tru-Fire Jr.,I bought this for my 8 year old son to use thinking it would be a little smaller than it actually is. It is pretty bulky on his wrist and could easily be used by an adult so it's something he could grow into. The trigger isn't spring loaded so it has to be set forward after each shot.
2,Positive lock,"Some of the time the grippers don't lock closed. This is ok for shooting in the yard, but I wouldn't let anyone use it for hunting."
3,ummm...,Don't buy this or the bigger size if you have big hands... I'm 13 and the bigger size is way to small after like a month of having the release I grew out of it but if you have small hands then I suggest you should buy this release esspecially if you are a begginer.
2,Strap / Loop uncomfortable.,"The plastic loop that the strap wraps around to secure the release to the shooters wrist was on the end of the strap and dug into my sons wrist, so it wasn't comfortable for him to shoot with. Other releases (Cobra Pro Caliper Jr. Release) has the plastic loop attached to the top of the strap vs. the end for some cusion so will try it."
3,Don't forget the nocking string!,"Forgot this needs nocking string on the bow to work. Did not order, oops. At least there are utube videos on how to do it."
3,Expected better,"This doesn't come up to the quality of Chessman's Lydia Cassatt Reads the Morning Paper. Although the story itself is interesting, there is too much jumping from one point of view to another to allow much development of any one character in such a short novel, and it felt fragmented to me, with an artificial ending."
5,looks good,It looks very good .my baby do not eat it yet.hope it will be fine. he can not drink milk.
1,Acupressure Facelift,"The concept is good BUT you never can tell where to go next. It is poorly filmed - the before and after pictures were a joke - there was no difference except a smile! I'm sure Meredith MacRae had never done the facelift on herself until just prior to filming. She often had her fingers in the wrong place (i.e. on top of the cheekbones instead of under). After the first 10 minutes where you are ""suppose"" to learn how to do it, they fill up the rest of the video with useless information. I got mine through a book club for $1. and I don't think it was even worth that!"
3,To Much Work!,"Granted this is about the only software on the market that semi gives you what you need, but it takes alot of time to learn. I actually had to print out all the help notes, and i'm an experienced user. The shopping list is really worthless. You need to write the recipes exactly in the same wording, so it understands what items to add to your shopping list. When I first got it I spent hours loading and re-loading the software because it would freeze up and just quit. What's with that? I did like the ""pantry"" feature, but when you want to buy two different sizes of the same item, trying to figure out the ounces takes major time. I think Valusoft needs to listen to their customers before releasing their product. But the recipes are a hugh benefit.That's the only reason I didn't return it...."
2,Please give us back old Sierra product,"I can't imagine a groups of software writers putting out a product like this. It is slow, buggy, difficult to organize recipes. I spent a lot of time collecting recipes but they are so hard to find in this edition, the whole program is worthless. To those that give this a good product review, you didn't know the old Mastercook 3.0."
2,Not great software,"I have had both the 7.0 and 8.0 versions of this software, and was duly unimpressed with both. It is loaded with LOUSY recipes, the search function is awkward, the software runs slowly, backups are unreliable and, the thing that irritated me most, the nutritional analysis of recipes was always WAY off. Either it didn't recognize half the ingredients in the recipe or it was just plain old unable to calculate the values. I thought that perhaps the 8.0 version would have worked out the bugs from 7.0, but I was wrong. I just purchased Cook'n software and so far it appears to be far superior."
5,item arrived ahead of expected arrival date and as advertised.,Love this program. It is very versital. I use the program to organize more than just food recipes.
2,bad software,"I purchased this software after doing much research and it worked fine for the first couple of times I opened it. On the 3rd time using the software, the program would not save lists (and deleted all the information I've put in) and started to get error pop-up windows. I've uninstalled the software and reinstalled it and had the same problem. I've contacted the manufacturing company and their opinion is that the computer has a problem. This seems to be the usual answer, when they don't know what the problem is. This software is aweful and will cause a lot of frustration."
1,mastercook deluxe 8.0,"This is a horrible program,it is not user friendly. For a recipe program pictures are very helpful. Whoever thought picture weren't necessary for a recipe was an idiot. I wish I had known this before purchasing this product. Waste of time and money"
5,what hit me?,"Pretty soon you get the feeling it's not going to ""end up happily"" (or even ""end up""...) but you still can't put it down. For anybody into Gothic/romance fiction & curious about experimental poetry (or vice versa): this book (& its ""heroine"") tiptoes nervously along all those border lines--terrifying, terrific!"
2,"compared to house ofleaves, this book is nothing","I just read house of leaves, which blew my hat off. This is really pale in comparison although it tries to do the same things. Go read House of Leaves instead/"
3,"Cable is good quality, but packaging is mediocre.","I purchased two of these to do a house wiring install. They at first had some problems when spooling out, the downspout that goes into the spool was broken and I had to fiddle with the cable to prevent it from kinking up for the first couple hundred feet. Other than that, no complaints."
5,Great Purchase,It is a cable. It connects things. It runs in my house. It has wires inside of it. It is not crappy. That is about it on a cable review. Hope this helps.
5,Boiling Point~ A GREAT BOOK!,"This book gave you an ideal look on how kids today, spend there summers, and how they act. I really enjoyed reading this and Diane Muldrow's other 2 books in the series. It's about how two twin girls, there freinds, Peichi, and Shawn cope with friends, customers and running their own cooking business, DISH!If you like a book about the 21st century girls, the internet and life pick this book up!"
1,Wish they'd make a better version!,"I am a teacher who reads this book to my class every year. I show the movie and this is a terrible version. They leave out almost the whole story, and change the rest. It is such a great book and I think they could have done a better job on the video. I am always hoping a newer and better version is made."
3,A Cricket in Time Square (VHS),"I bought this for my 4th grade students, and they loved it! We read the story first and compared it to the video. It would be great, if it was on DVD."
4,almost as good as his other book. still good though,"Dick Couch's previous book, Warrior elite: the forging of seal class 228 is one of the best Seal books i've read to date. this builds on that book. It's just a tad bit dry, but still a fairly good read."
2,Underwhelmed,"I bought this book in the aftermath of Seal Team Six's success in Pakistan. I assumed there would be no better author to delve into SEAL training than Dick Couch based on his earlier work. I didn't get what I expected. What I got was a lot infuriating acronyms, unnecessary minutiae, and God Bless America propoganda. I was hoping to learn a little more about the dudes that becomes SEALS, what they do as SEALS, and what becomes of them after their service. This is NOT that book."
2,Nostalgic,Pretty tame by todays standards but it was fun seeing the 1970's hairstyles and untrimmed bush's. The plot lines were so silly that the DVD reminded me of an X rated movie without the X rated action. The Movie is done in German so it was hard for me to follow at times.
5,Interesante Documental,"No cabe duda que Europa está mucho mas avanzada que nuestro continente, estos reportes de 1970 hablan de lo abierto que son en cuanto a la sexualidad los alemanes, si bien es cierto algunos casos parecen inventados, la filmación de los mismos en los 70's y las preguntas que hacen a los transeuntes hace por demás interesante el documenmtal. Desde el primero hasta este último, flata esperar el Reporte 6"
4,heavy duty trash can,I thought it was a little difficult to put together. I didn't figure out that you have to loosely put it together and then tighten the hex screws part way. If you tighten the screws all the way the frame distorts and it won't go together properly. It is a bland kind of gray but it is very sturdy and well made. Much heavier than you would expect. I would buy it again.
3,not so all weather,"Overall it serves its purpose however, it is not so ""all weather"" it gets very very hot in the sun making it nearly impossible to open without a pot holder. The hinges are cheap. I ordered two cans 3 months ago, one is holding up nicely while the other has a broken hinge and the legs are questionable."
2,Disappointing,This was a disappointing buy. Two of the plastic end caps on the legs used to keep from scratching your floor up were totally broken off. There is a hole punched in the very front (of course) about the size of a nickel that can't be fixed. I glued some floor caps on the piece myself because this thing is to big to fool with returning. I had two sides put together before I noticed these defect. Don't waste your money.
3,pain in the can,discolored section on front of can. and the bags are extremely difficult to pull out because of the metal bars on each of the inside sections that hold the metal ring that holds the bag in place.
4,Wicker-Resin Trash Can,"This product was received in excellent condition. It does require assembling which takes about 30 minutes with simple directions. Very functional, looks good as I have similar accessories on my patio that go with this. This was the most reasonable priced wicker resin trash can I could find. Frontgate has one for over $300 which is ridiculous to spend for a trash can and is almost the same look.Great deal! Especially if you use your amazon credits like I did and it only cost me after the credits less than $2.00!!! Go Amazon credit card!"
4,Nice product,"This is a very sturdy trash can. It is a very dark, but muted color. Kind of a grey-brown, not the rich brown shown in the photo. It is great for outside, and I live in AZ with extreme heat and it is holding up great."
4,Can Can!,We wanted a trash can to match our patio set and this is it! We bought our furniture from Home Depot and this is wonderful with it. It is a great size so you don't have to empty the bin after each outdoor meal (or during!). Heavy enough that it won't blow over and attractive.
3,trash,Very handsome and made well. I don't use it too often only when I entertain for barbeques because it can't be left out.I only gave it a 3 because of the price and it can't be left out.
4,A wonderful surprise.,"I'm not usually a fan of ""violin"" / country style music, which is what I thought Tracy Bonham did. Well, she opened for the Blue Man Group and had some really interesting music. A little 60's, and things I never heard before. So I picked up ""Blink"" on a lark. I would honestly say there are 5 tracks on there that are now on every playlist I have... really, really good stuff. Very upbeat, with some thoughtful lyrics (man, she's got ""pipes"".If you like music where the artist really wants to ""convey"" a feeling, pick up Blink when you need a ""pick me up"". Tracy is a goot artist, and I think you'll enjoy."
3,Pretty Good,"I was glad she finally had a new album out & purchased this one quickly. I think this album has to grow on one more. I am still deciding what i do and do not like about this latest endeavor. I still like her first album the best, but this one isn't bad. It has some good lyrics and music, but it seems she's suppressing her edginess. Its good but not excellent in my opinion."
4,A mature Bonham sound that's still unique,"HOOORAY!! Finally a new TB release. After listening, I was a bit surprised...the girl has grown up, matured, but has managed to keep her signature sound. For a little on my favorite tracks, read on:The opening track, Something Beautiful, is just that. Great vocals, great guitar, great everything. What a pleasing opener. Eyes has a very catchy melody and is a well done near-ballad. Dumbo Sun is awesome! A fun tune with fun lyrics. Shine is my second favorite on the disc. I love the inspirational lyrics and smokin' melody. Shine has the best chorus of any song.Bottom Line: TB fans, this is a must buy. You won't be disappointed, in fact, probably very pleased with her mature sound. You can still hear some of the early Bonham influences here, but they are refined and polished. Thanks for the music, Tracy!"
2,Wha? What Happened Here....,"Well... Not much apparently! I'm just gonna come right out and say it: the story has gone down the tubes!(as has everything else, save the great music)The animation quality has gone from poor to just downright ugly. This makes shows like Digimon look like Ghost in the Shell. As for the new characters... huge dissapointment! They are all shallow and simply put, very dull in apperance and character. Well, if you've collected the first three videos in this series my advice is stop now or look forward to being let down. A pity, because near the start this series had some potential."
4,Contains a different side of the story of espionage,"This book seems like it is not a typical documentation of spying and sabateuring as most government and FBI files have publicized to America. It seems to be the ""untold"" story. A plus for this book is that it presents not only it's perspective upon the spy stories, but others' perspectives as well. Johnson chooses the stories well and alternates between different stories throughout the book, and thus held my interest."
1,I did not enjoy this book,"Did I enjoy this book: I really didn't enjoy this book. I was expecting so much more after reading the synopsis.This book is not a YA book so much as it is a middle grade book. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy middle grade books but this book just really fell flat and was not intriguing at all. For the most part, the sentences were short and choppy and the story just didn't flow that well in my opinion.I could not connect with Jack, who is eleven and in grade school during this short story (about 80 pages on my Nook). His adventures and actions were not believable. I did like Mr. Fink and Arturo, which is surprising since Arturo was sort of the bully in the book. They were the most believable characters to me.Would I recommend it: No, I would not recommend this book.Will I read it again: No, I will not read this book again."
4,Surprisingly good!,"Not gonna lie, the summary and front cover had me thinking this book was going to be YA. However, the main character, Jack, is just eleven years old - which definitely threw me - especially when I sort of expected him to grow older as the story progressed. Again, my mistake.In spite of my surprise, I quickly warmed to Oliver and his young mind. The way he talked about his ""fiancee"" was endearing, and you couldn't help but admire his determination. You see, Jack puts 110% into everything he decides to do - and his bravery might even put Harry Potter to shame! :pBack To Bataan was obviously written with a great deal of thought and care. It's impossible not to get caught up in Oliver's story because it is just so believable. Jerome Charyn created a character you want to root for, even when he does something bad, you can't help but cheer him on and hope everything works out for him.If you're looking for a quick read with a good dose of action and humour, it's definitely worth a read!"
2,Didn't like them,These did not work well for large boat bumpers or hanging from a pontoon. They might work better for a small boat or a jet ski. The rope never stayed in place.
4,Dance all night long!,"This is one of the only CD's that you can play straight through and dance to every cut. I highly recommend this cd for parties. Your guests will dance all night! The fast/slow mix is well ordered, and even enjoyable for those who choose to just listen.....but they will be few."
2,Padded out,"It's refreshing to see a thriller where people do things for ideological reasons, instead of the usual '25 tons of metric gold' stuff.But there is quite a lot that is extraneous to the main plot: Consuala and the judge who kills Ines for example (though it's the best writing in the book in my opinion). There's also too much preachy stuff in the middle. I also find it unlikely that a terrorist organisation would take a gay dress designer into its inner councils with little more than a nod and a wink.But the book's main drawback is that Wilson can't really do character. He tries to achieve this by talking psychology, but it doesn't work. Virtually all the men are interchangeable - which is a problem if they have unfamiliar names - and the women are mad."
3,"NOT QUITE ""SMALL DEATH IN LISBON""",A GOOD BOOK BUT NOT AS INTERESTING AS HIS EARLIER BOOKS. I THINK HE SHOULD GO BACK AND WRITE THE WEST AFRICA SCENE AGAIN AS MUCH HAS CHANGED.
2,Missing and repeated pages,"My paperback version pages go 1-24, 73-104, 57 to I think the end of the book. So I agree with some of the reviewers that the book repeats :) but I'm hoping to find a complete version to read as I stopped at the second reading of page 73. First Harvest edition 2007Can anyone verify that the Kindle version is complete?"
3,This little thing here,"Truthfully, this thing is incredibly difficult to figure out. It took me near 15 minutes trying to change the time zone. I had to put it away until I could keep my cool in order look at it again. It's nice but it takes a while to figure the thing out when you first get it."
2,hard to use!,"I misplaced the operating instructions shortly after purchasing this clock. How hard can it be to set a clock, you might ask? Spend 20 minutes trying to get it to the right time zone and you'll see the problem with this clock. Not intuitive in design at all! Hard to read at night, too."
2,Annoying,"Here's a link for the instructions.https://home.comcast.net/~mark.flint/spc364/I've had this about 6 years and am just about annoyed enough to throw it out and try again.I live in Columbus, Indiana and it has never synced reliably with the signal from Colorado. Without the sync, it drifts about 16 seconds per week, so it needs pretty frequent manual time setting.For comparison, my cheap Casio watch only gains about one second every 3 days. After two weeks, the watch is still within 5 seconds, while the ""atomic"" Sharp has drifted 30 seconds.As other reviews have pointed out, the loud beep with each button press is also quite annoying."
2,Sharp SPC364 Atomic LCD Bedside Alarm Clock,"I bought this as a present for my wife. After a couple of weeks it quit sychronising with the world time signal, and drifted out of accuracy like any other clock."
1,It stopped working but I couldn't return it.,"When we got this alarm clock, it worked fine and we were happy with it. Unfortunately, after about a week, it stopped working. (It was not a bad battery. I tried several batteries and I have a battery tester.) We had recycled the packaging so I could not return it. I recycled the clock, too. I'm glad it wasn't more expensive. By the way, when the clock was working, we could not have set the alarm without the instructions. How it worked was not obvious."
2,I'll second everything here ... not worth the hassle,"I actually found this page while searching for instructions for the two that I have. It's impossible to figure outhow to set almost anything without them. The ""backlighting"" is actually an incandescent bulb that is virtually useless. OTOH, the clock functionality seems to be fine.Anyone know how to turn off DST?I wouldn't purchase these again."
1,You need a flashlight to read it,Setting it is not intuitive and it is easy to accidentally touch a button and throw some setting off.The time is nearly impossible to see at any angle even when I hit the snooze button to activate the weak backlight.
3,Changing days is not good,"I've had this clock for a couple of years. Every once in a while (seemingly random) the date will be incorrect. I can't imagine how this happens, since the clock is in a room where NO ONE ELSE GOES. Just this morning, I found it to be one day off. The time is exactly right on, but the date is off. Today, it was one day slow. Other times I've found it MANY days off. There is seemingly no indication that the battery is low. I'm just reporting this here, since this seems to be a clearinghouse site for problems/solutions for this clock."
1,Find something else,One third of the clock display went bad after less than a year. I do not have the receipt and looks like it costs at least $8 plus shipping to get warranty sevice.
4,Perfect travel accesory,"I purchased a second Sharp Atomic clock to replace one out of warranty. The cost to have it repaired and shipping for getting it there was more than the cost of a new one. I love the clock. It keeps perfect time and the button on top for illuminating the time is very handy and does not bother any other sleeper. The alarm, when I have used it, is of sufficient loudness for me to hear without my hearing aids, but not so strident to startle or awaken others."
3,Location for Directions,"The directions for this clock are available online at spc364 dot comI had problems finding them anywhere else.It is a nice little clock, but the interface is very hard to figure out. I had to read the directions."
2,Noisy clock,It keeps time - wow - what a surprise - Its a CLOCK - duh. The beeping it makes EVERY time I push one of its buttons is incredibly annoying (especially if I miss the minutes by one and have to go 59 beeps to get it right). Is there no way to turn these unnecessary beeps off? This makes it impossible for me or my spouse to set the alarm AFTER anyone has gone to sleep - unless we don't care and just wake them up with the incessant beeping. AAAAARRRRRGGGGHHH. So much for a good night's sleep.
2,Clock review,"Doesn't pick up time signal consistently, which is why I replaced it. The last one I had was the same model. Sharp just doesn't build things the way they used to."
1,"If you buy this product, no matter how cheap, You're an Idiot","So, I qualify for idiocy. Guilty of buying this crappy thing 'cause it looked decent. It has everything wrong that you could possibly design wrong. Very difficult to set alarm (or switch alarm times), alarm too loud or too low, switches between military time and normal time on its own, can't just click or push a button to set the alarm at night. I doubt this product is actually a ""Sharp"" alarm--but rather they lent their name to make a quick profit. Now, they can pay the price through these kinds of reviews. I would give it Zero stars if I could."
1,In the trash... finally,"Now I remember why I removed the battery and put this in a drawer almost a year ago. It wouldn't adjust to correct time and when I set it manually, it kept going back to weird time.Put a battery in 3 hours ago, clock defaulted to 2:00AM PST. I changed the time zone, to MST. Still incorrect.Changed the time and day to the correct settings. 3 hours later, it reverts. It's 10:03AM MST where I live, the clock reads 5:45.I'll save the battery, this thing goes in the trash today."
3,Works fine but impossible to figure out,I agree with the person who said it is impossible to figure out w/o the manual. I did lose it and I couldn't believe my luck to find that this person had thoughtfully placed the directions in his/her review. Thanks! I somehow got it off my timezone and could't get back. Otherwise it works fine. I have had it for two years. I like the smallness and dim light for my purposes. But I can see why those who use it as an alarm would find it less than great.
1,Frustrating - dont wast your money,"This frustrating little clock is a waste of money. Does not sync up, gains time after I corrrect the time (from my computer time), and impossible to figure out without the manual. Worth nothing. Its a waste of time - pun intended...Better to get a cheap one from the drug store."
2,Trouble Picking Up Signal,"I have two of these clocks. I love the accuracy of atomic clocks so wanted them to keep me on time in bathroom in morning. However, this clock does not seem to be picking up atomic signal because over time it loses minutes. Perhaps a one-battery atomic clock is not good enough for connecting with the signal (from Colorado isn't it?) when one lives in Virginia, as I do. We have two other atomic clocks in the house, both of which require more batteries and have no trouble picking up the daily atomic signal. So, I am looking for small atomic clocks with more than one battery. Agree with problems with instructions - have to dig them out whenever I need to set anything on clock. Not self-explanatory like more clocks."
1,atomic my runp!,"This cute little alarm clock is just that...cute...nothing else...I set it and got military time (it set itself to that) and when I set the alarm, good thing I woke up and looked at the clock, as it never went off...Will buy something else...this is a disaster...a CUTE disaster..."
1,Sharp neve made alarm clocks,I have one of alarm clock which has SHARP log on it. My relative who is upper stuff of Sharp in Japan found this alarm clock at my home and he was surprised because they never made alarm clock in the past. This must be fake Sharp products made in China.[...]
2,The picture is wrong,"The brace probably works really well, but it's not black, it's ugly medicinal beige. Like, really ugly, greenish beige. Order it if you are okay with that, but the picture is not what you'll get."
2,Epi-Lock Elbow Brace,"The brace is not well made, the stitching is not going to last long in my physical outdoor job. While it is good to have material on the inside that gripes so it doesn't slip, it is a poor choice of gripping material."
2,Don't use this book as a primary study guide,"There's a lot of unnecessary info in this book that you won't even see on the exam. The practice questions in the book are way too wordy and confusing. Exam Cram has helped me in the past, but not this time."
3,Good for companion studying,"As someone stated for a review about th 70-272 book, this book contains alot of high leven material and really no basic information that Technciians deal with on a daily basis. I am sitting this exam tomorrow and purchased this book today for a quickcram. After reading a few chapters I feel like I have never studied before. When they do attempt to hit on some basic stuff they contradict themselves in later chapters.For example:Capter 1 review question: Which of the following OS's cannot be upgraded to XP Home or Pro? One of the answers is Windows 95 which is fine, but then in a later chapter (I forget which one) a question starts out: ""You have just upgraded your Windows 95 PC to Windows XP Pro....""I would use this as a companion to another study guide."

3,Slogged through it,"For a debut novel, this is not bad, but not worth reading again or buying. The character development was good, but the story line was questionable. The Whyos and Why Not gang members were not realistic and I agree with another reviewer that I felt it was more like West Side Story than true gang membership. The gang members are chosen and inducted because they have perfect pitch and can carry on complex sounds and techniques used by ventriloquists. While, I credit the author with a creative idea, her style was not able to convey the concept well. I liked the characters in the story, but the pace was very slow. I kept reading hoping it would get better, but when I finished it, I wished that I had stopped earlier."
4,Compelling read,"Unlike one of the other reviewers, I am not familiar with much historical fiction set in New York City. That being said, I think the author of this novel did a great job of painting the picture of post-Civil War New York and filling out the life stories of the main characters. While for me some of the characterizations (the Why-oing) and plot twists (main character's job changes) seemed far-fetched, I was drawn in by the characters' stories and the rich texture of the setting of the story. It did take me several chapters to get into the author's prose, but by the middle of the book, I was flying through the pages and looking forward to the next time I'd be able to sit down with the book. I don't know, if you're an expert on New York history or are more interested in the history part than the fiction, maybe this book is not for you. For me, this was a compelling and enjoyable read."
4,Opportunity and opportunism abound,"I enjoyed this novel. It is well-written, mixes history and possibility in a style broadly similar to The Crimson Petal, and the White.The story is as much about New York as it is about the characters who glide, stride or bustle across the pages.We see the best, and the worst, of the people and the metropolis they inhabit. Opportunities are seized, opportunism abounds.We leave the main characters poised on the brink of a hopeful and successful future. I wanted more."
2,Just okay,"I am generally a sucker for anything about New York City, especially if it is set, as this book is, in a historical New York City. However, while this book's take on the building of the Brooklyn bridge and the gang culture that made up the Five Points was interesting, I felt that it was too long and that the ""coincidences"" that continually made things go right for the characters were too on the nose."
3,Locking tool bag,"Like the fact I can lock the bag. Wont stop a Thief From getting in bag but you wont have to worry about Random people barrowing tools out your bag when your not around. I bought Strap kit for bag, This Bag was not built for strap. The metal frame at mouth of bag bends over your side when carrying bag. Found a little 3/4""x 1/4"" Flat bar and drilled out 11 rivets on one side of metal mouth, side I put strap on. Bolted Flat bar to metal mouth with 11 #10 Machine screws. Then bolted strap to the holes at end of Flat bar close to top corners of tool bag. Works Great now"
1,Product not as advertised,"The product is shown in Canon retail packaging. The Cartridges came in a generic white box with foam and a note saying essentially 'Don't worry, these are genuine Canon Cartridges'. While they may be genuine cartridges, the packaging makes me suspicious. In addition there was ink on the outsides of the shrink wrap for each cartridge and the shrink wrap did not quite match other Canon cartridges I have. The cartridges may be fine, but I won't take the chance. Especially since they aren't any cheaper than buying them elsewhere. I choose to return the cartridges, which fortunately Amazon makes very easy."
1,"Get Confused, Gauranteed.","Although the preparation material is decent, the sample practice tests are awful. I just took the verbal tests and more than one third of the questions were either low quality, unclear, or just plain wrong. More than half of the critical reasoning questions have arguably no correct answer or more than one correct answer. The explanations are just a few words more than ""Answer B is correct because I say so"". The author seems to be incapable of critical reasoning and logical analysis, let alone teaching you about them."
1,"Not the best quality prep material, save your money","I got the book a few days before my exam because I wanted more practice. The material in the book is early beginner level. If you rely on this as a primary guide, you're in for a rude awakening on test day. More importantly, the testing software leaves a lot to be desired. Besides being buggy, there are problems with the material as well. Some questions are vague, incorrect and at least one was simply wrong. The level of the questions in the quant section is low and unrealistic. I believe that the same software is packaged with the Peterson guide as well (same publisher) and I looked at that guide too.You could apply any of the reviews written for this book to that book as well.In short, save your money and time. Go elsewhere."
2,Plain wrong sample questions,"2 out of the first 20 practice questions (quantitative section) are wrong. I don't feel like using it any further, as the remaining questions are ambiguous.Glad that I borrowed the book from a library and did waste my money."
1,what a mistake,"I bought this book in a hurry at a local store, since I remembered good things about a different Arco prep book - what a mistake. It doesn't seem like the writers spent too much time putting this together. Lots of copying and pasting of instructions; annoying formatting/structure; sometimes questionable explanations to example questions.In short - I'm going to purchase another guidebook today. Don't waste your time/money on this one!"
4,Handy little book on color,"This little book is packed with color schemes suiting a multitude of applications. Whether you are a textile designer, graphic artist, 3-d animator, any kind of visual artist, ""Color Harmony"" opens up a world of color. I find this very helpful when I need a fresh approach & am pressed for time. The text offers a keen insight into how color really works! A simple, handy little book suited for anyone working with color."
4,Resource for Color Combinations,"This book is a great tool for finding color combinations. It contains small samples of 2, 3, and 4-color combinations. At the bottom of each combination page is a tip for using colors together. My only quibble is that the samples are VERY small, probably because the footprint of the book is also small.Recommended for getting ideas on color."
3,Looking for better guidelines for use of color,"Overwhelmed with color combos, but not effective guidelines for combining."
3,Hard to use,"This book has some decent information, but using the colors in the book is made ridiculously difficult by the color chart at the end of the book. First, if a value is a zero, they put nothing at all. This makes it difficult for your eye to trace the line of numbers for your color. Second, though the colors are given in CMYK, they are given in the order YMCK. This means to enter the color into Photoshop or another image program, you have to start with the third number, read back to the first, then jump to the last. It's not brain surgery, but much more difficult than it should be."
1,great idea / bad product,I looked long and hard for this product. I wish now that I had not made this purchase. The cutting blade portion is thicker than a steak knife and it does not cut the butter into paper thin slices (like the add says it does).More like the thickness of a pad of butter. Also you have to chase the butter all over the plate or hold the butter still with your hand to make it cut. I did find if I stood the butter up on one end and cut down toward the plate it worked better but still very thick slices.A few days after I purchased this I found a carrot/potato peeler that does the job perfectly. And it really does cut paper thin slices. The peeler I found has an open blade so the butter falls away nicely. I wanted to do this to get my kids and myself to lay off so much butter when we have pancakes.Sorry for the bad review...
4,The Compact Reader,"I don't care much for the textbook part of it -- it's wordy and too prescriptive. But it has lots of readable examples of essays from a diverse group including: James Thurber, Ellen Goodman, Bruce Catton, Langston Hughes, Mark Twain, and others. It's hard to find a better bunch of non-fiction writers in one spot. If you ignore much of the intra-essay content, it is a good collection."
5,natural enemies,"Great book , arrived on time, no problems at all. Good read to help me get through the summer and get ready for the season!"
4,Outstanding,"Firstly I was impressed that the author is Canadian.To have the knowledge and determined approach to gather the statistics, about something as sacred as Bigtime college football in the midwestern USA is a job in itself.The book was not just something that has statistics strewn all through it, but a glimpse into the politics and thinking behind the scenes of college footballs biggest rivalry. Well done!"
1,It's been 30 days and I haven't received my order yet!,Would love to write a review of this product but 30 days after I ordered it I still have nothing to use or review!
2,Dull,"Young Buck, the 3rd member of G-Unit to release a solo LP, didn't find too much sucess with ""Let Me In"". The song had nowhere near the impact as Lloyd Banks' ""On Fire"", mainly due to its overly simplistic production and cliched hook. Young Buck couldn't match up against Lloyd Banks lyrically either, and with the two songs peaking at around the same time, it didn't help Young Buck's cause too much."
5,A Strong Case for Darwinian Compatibilism,"After reading Freedom Evolves, I would have to say that Dennett accomplished that which he set out to do, namely, to explain in a popular science book that all the varieties of free will that is worth wanting is possible on determinism.Dennett exposes the metaphysical baggage that has been around the debate on free will and argues that free will is the ability to simulate probable events and act to avoid unpleasant consequences and that everything you do is a result of your nature, your thoughts, desires, knowledge and past decisions; what you do is a result of who you are.A marvelous book that might just provide the solution to the problem of free will. In essence, it has gone a long way towards this goal. Another good treatment of compatibilism can be found in Richard Carrier's bookSense and Goodness Without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism."
4,"Molecular Structures, but Very Special Molecular Structures","The fundamental thrust of the book is to devolve ""free will"" from naturalistic determinism. This is well set forth. Unfortunately, he also argues that humans are the only beings with free will: though I suspect that anyone who has spent much time around other animals is unlikely to agree.Mostly well presented, though at times tendentious. I do wish that he had not felt it necessary to preserve the ""We humans, even if not made in the image of god, are still so very special in that we are the only beings with free will.""Objectively, we are neither the ""Lords of Creation"", nor the ""Most Wonderfully Unique Animals in the Universe"". We share our biological, and behavioral, roots with the rest of the life on this very small island in space."
2,Nothing New,"Same old Dan, he trys so hard to redefine the myth of destiny-controlling agency, i.e. ""free will"", in a way palatable to the public. The end result is semantic gymnastics that try and substitute evolutionary complexity for free will. Sorry Dan, it doesn't work. Complex biological processes have not transcended the innate physical causality of neurophysiology and they never will. Paul Churchland does a far better job of articulating these issues without the self-serving bombast."
2,Thoroughly unimpressed,"I didn't learn anything new in this book. The writing is cloudy and arrogant and redundant and inefficient. While I agree with Dennett's basic premise, that questions of ethics and free will should be asked from an evolutionary standpoint (how does this help the species survive?) I closed the book feeling altogether unsatisfied. Dennett always meanders around points and then claims them later. His arguments are not clear and convincing. Some of the main points in the book are:that free will is an evolutionary adaptationthat indeterminism is not made possible by quantum mechanicsthat decisions are processes taking place in the brain over space and time and therefore cannot be pin-pointedbut to me none of these theses are new or surprising, and I just don't see what took him so many pages to say what he said."
4,can freedom go beyond horizon?,"Dennett is using the analogy that free will is like atmosphere and that how it has evolved to support the life on earth is associated with free will (our free will started journey as infant and is still growing up). He is also comtemplating on determinism using sort of simulation logic. so far so good, but some arguments have been employed over and over from his previous books(like game theory..etc), as if Dennett feels obliged to put forth the same computer generated,IT like matters to convince readers. It would rather be more convincing if he used more philosophical arguments."
1,WRONG ITEM - Not even sure an 11' salad bowl is made in the Sterling pattern by Wedgwood (not on their or any other website),"My experience was the same as the other reviewer--a creamer was sent. I did some research after it was delivered only to discover that there doesn't appear to be a Serving Salad Bowl like this on Wedgwood's site for the Sterling pattern. Macy's doesn't have one, nor does any other site I search through.I noticed the product description on the packing materials from Amazon reads: STERLING CREAM Wedgwood Sterling Bone China Salad Bowl--perhaps people fulfilling the orders are only reading the ""STERLING CREAM""--if in fact this item really does exist (doesn't explain why no other websites specializing in Wedgwood china has no such item).Never had any other problems with Amazon purchases or the items shipped by Amazon over the past 10+ years; I'm confident they'll quickly process my refund."
3,"polar power is ""ok""","i used the polar power meter for a season and felt that it was ok while i used it. i wanted to go to the powertap. after i did, i realized that polar was way off. i know this because polar's website claims about 10% accuracy and powertap was 1.5%. turns out my lactate threshold was about 10-15 watts below what polar was registering. not cool."
3,"Great Idea, Faulty Execution","Bought this with an S625 monitor (same as an S725 but with a foot pod) for my new Trek 5200.It should be noted that the Power Sensor should be installed by a bike mechanic who has had experience with the device and it's connections. Trial and error are the key here. The HR watch connection should be VERY secure, as any large vibration will disconnect the sensor leads.Once properly set up, the device works as described. The frequency approach to force calcs is an elegant solution.Unfortunately, the device has proven to be not very robust. After only about 200 miles of use, the sensor has died... twice. I have returned it, and will buy a wireless Polar speed and cadence sensor to replace it and do without the power calcs."
1,Quality poor from Polar,"I bought this item, though not from the merchant listed above. I bought in a physical store and installed it, which took hours. I then realized there was a faulty connection. I took it back and replaced it, when through the whole installation process, then again realized there was a faulty connection and also the battery cover did not fit properly.So in short, a great idea, but I had bad luck the two times I tried it with lousy product quality. After the second attempt I asked for my money back.It's a shame - I really wanted this to work as the product is so much cheaper than the alternatives."
3,Frame vs. Picture Quality?,"The frame is more beautiful than the picture. The clarity is not as great as I've seen in some for the money. I purchased it to match the decor in my home, but the picture clarity is lacking (brightness in particular) and volume extremely low. Would likely be better in an office setting than a home. My $60.00 generic frame does a much better job a picture display, but the frame is not near as nice. Your satisfaction with this product will depend on what is important to you."
1,Malignant 360!,"I wish I could have given this steaming pile of bits no stars! I installed Norton 360 on two computers. It slowed down both of them. Not severely so, until the program started to nag me to renew my subscription. After I did so I lost the use of my laptop for about 4 days. It slowed down so much that it took 4-6 HOURS to boot up and about the same amount of time to shut down!!! After determining that Norton could be the problem it took me almost 18 hours to delete the program. Perhaps the problems have been corrected in Version 2. I AM NOT GOING TO TAKE THE CHANCE!!! I had already removed the program from my other machine because it blocked me from connecting to my ipod, pda and many online functions."
1,"Stink, Stank, Stunk!!!",This is the worst Norton product ever!!! They should be ashamed at even releasing it. My computer has been used more be their service techs than by me. Shame on you Norton!!!!
3,Slow start up,I loaded this on 3 computers and I have noticed a significant different in boot up time now when powering up the computer after I installed Norton 360.
1,MOST USELESS SOFTWARE I'VE EVER USED - DON'T BUY IT,"I loaded on three computers. Within 24 hours the software warned that my/their firewall was not working. It took me to an area in their product where I could fix it. I clicked 'fix' and nothing happened; I tried this many times. It simply wouldn't work. Tried to call their tech support and learned that both phone numbers in their documentation had been disconnected. Tried to go online - by then they moved me to a ""working offline status"" - and I couldn't get online to get tech assistance. This happened to 3 computers in one night. I returned Norton 360 to Amazon."
4,Need imporvements.,"Although Norton Symantec has the best customer services in the world so far, but the 360 V.3 to V.5 still need more improvements. Too bulky and large software for small net-book, and kind of make slow the 2 GB ram notebooks. Need more RAM to run this software smoothly and transitional. I still admire this Norton because of the best customer services all around the world. If you travel in some point of your life to the third world countries and have a very slow internet the upgrade or update is horrible and painful processes. In fast internet area I do not compare the Norton 360 Symantec to any other available product in customer services.Dr. Qader Noorzad"
3,Perfect INternet Security package for a Senior,"I'm involved with a non-progit organization called SeniorNet that teaches seniors how to use computers. Many seniors are primarily interested in the Internet and Email, but tend to get nervous about possible threats. Norton 360 is the perfect package for them, providing great security without a lot of technical tuning. It's basically install and forget, let the default settings do their thing."
1,360 WAS A JOKE,"This program only gave me problem after problem.. When I wanted to open a web page, say to pay a bill, the program said my bank web was a virus and would not let me access it. Yes, not able to get on my bank's web page to pay a bill. I had to delete the program from my computer, then restart it to be able to access the web page. Over and Over!!! I kept e-mailing the support, and they said they are working on the problem. When will I be able to get to the imporant web pages? That is why I have a Computer!!This program was nothing but a problem. Don't waste your MONEY!"
1,Major Problems,I had had prior Norton products on this computer with OK results. After I installed Norton 360 headaches started--freezing and crashing on the internet and desktop programs as well. Finally my computer was almost unusable. My computer revived after I uninstalled it: it works fine.
1,Worse than a virus,"As an IT professional I would strongly recommend against installing Norton 360 on your computer. I have been a big fan of Norton Security for years and I have it installed on all my home computers for years. After installing Norton 360, it erased most of my security settings and my computer continiusly crashed. It messed up on of my home computers to the point that not only it would crash several times a day, but I couldn't even use System Restore to recover my computer and I was forced to rebuild the system from scratch.Don't believe the promise to install it easily on 3 computers either. Symantec makes as difficult as possible for you to download the software and isntall it.I am ready to switch to McAfee."
1,My computer runs so slow,"I installed this after my old Norton expired, and I made the mistake. Others are all correct. It took half a day during a busy work period to get the thing installed and since then it takes so long to load pages. I need it as a profession and I can not wait as long as I do inbetween pages to load !!! Hate it !!"
1,Vista compatibility,Installed great - looked good. Day 3 it started blocking me from websites 'as their security certificate had been revoked' - Amazon even? After a week of back and forth 'support' they couldn't fix it and left me with a partially working PC to drown. THe PC support is partially automated as they didn't read my responses and their advice went in circles. Plus trying to fully uninstall it is a nightmare.It might work on XP but don't get it if you have Vista.
2,I am terribly dissapointed with this product.,"There is obviously something wrong with this product. My internet connection been very slow since I installed this product, and closing programs take an unusually long time as well too. I thought it was because I had 3 other Symantec products that were previously installed that had to be uninstalled, but I installed the 360 on my wife's computer - which used McAfee - and now she has the same problems as well. Symantec quality control really messed up here. I've been a big fan of Symantec for many years, so I hope a patch is released soon. In the meantime, I suggest waiting for another version of this program before buying."
2,Shoud have stayed with System Works Premier,"Quirky & always demanding of intervention. I cannot recommend it, and I am glad I experimented on myself before recommending it to others."
1,Bloatware,This software makes Internet browsing slow down to a crawl because it's so bloated and resource intensive. Stay away and use anything else but this horrible product.
1,Worst software purchase ever,"I was a satisfied Norton/Symantec customer for years, and considered their software as the ""gold standard."" My first round of frustration was last year's purchase of Norton Internet Security, but I eventually worked out the various problems with the installation when it turned out I had a bad CD (I eventually figured it out; their tech support was useless). I bought Norton 360 for my 3 computers this year, and it was the worst mistake I have ever made with software. Installation problems, multiple errors, and poor/incorrect technical support via chat. Symantec has lost me as a return customer. I wish I had read more of the user reviews first."
4,Norton 360 All-In-One Security,"Very easy to install after removing McAffee. After 2 months it works quietly in the background without the constant solicitations that are part and parcel of McAfee. Norton has blocked a couple emails that almost certainly were hostile and it did that without a big fuss. Any virus scan involves quite a lot computer resource usage, and this one is no exception -- the usage is tolerable and about average and that is the only reason for giving it a 4 instead of a 5."
1,Do not buy this product,"I downloaded this product and immediately my computer slowed down. Then I noticed my ""system restore"" and ""defragment"" programs had completely disappeared. Also, I got an extra toolbar that wouldn't go away. This software is extremely intrusive and overreaching. Once I uninstalled it, all my problems immediately went away. Save yourself the trouble and purchase another product. I am currently trying to get my money back and hopefully don't have to go into the legal system."
1,Norton 360 Caused and UNRECOVERABLE crash,"I ""upgraded"" to Norton 360 about two months ago on two computers with both afterwards performing extremely slow and CPU usage (from Norton modules) often running in excess of 80%. But, worst of all, just today when it was doing a ""routine"" scan and cleaning, it crashed my computer bringing the ""blue screen of death"". I have been unable to restart my computer even in safe mode. (I have found online that this is a problem that has affected around 1000 computers in China due to a Norton mistake that deletes a Windows system file.)Norton's online chat-help was not helpful. They only thing they could tell me was to restart in safe mode and then UNINSTALL Norton and reinstall...their classic response to every problem. I immediately uninstalled 360 from my working computer and installed NOD32.DO NOT BUY NORTON 360. I sure hope I can get a refund..."
1,Shame on Amazon!,"I received an email from Amazon touting this ""wonderful"" product. With reviews like these I wouldn't touch 360 with a ten foot pole! C'mon, Amazon, you've been known for quality products for all these years. Your integrity is worth more than recommendations for people to buy junk. Please withdraw your support for 360."
1,junk,"Unfortunately this is one of the worst pieces of software I installed on my PC. I regret it. From multiple unnecessary windows that the program opens, through complete lack of automatic communication with its own server to permanent email scanning errors and crashes this program is waste of money and time."
1,Amazon erased all the reviews Do not buy terrible program.,"Do not buy this junkware Amazon erased all reviews.People may be fooled into buying this junkware.It will kill your programs and erase your critical data.I will add more info on the review if it goes past the amazon censors..Update 7/19/07.The reviews were restored..I just want to add that my computer was essentially destroyed by this wonderful program,costing me over 200 dollars to be repaired.Never Again Goodbye Norton!!!"
1,JUNK! Avoid Norton 360,"After installing Norton 360 my computer's performance went downhill. Boot time took about 5-9 mins, programs were slow to load and often stalled. Once I uninstalled the product, performance was back to normal. Basically this is junk."
1,forever problems - true to form,"I have had many many versions of Symantec. the latest is Norton 360. I bought it because it was a 3 computer license, and I have 3 computers. But, true to form, it is STILL one of the most annoying softwares on the market. thanks largely to one piece - ccapp.exe. if I put a CD in my laptop, Norton 360 hangs. No matter how many times I click on it, nothing, and ccapp.exe is running at 50% of my cpu.Try ANYTHING else."
1,Software is a disaster,"I had Norton 2004 running on XP, never experienced a problem, so when it was time to renew my subscription I opted for this upgrade. Big mistake: it devours system resources, especially memory, slows processor speed to a crawl, made it impossible to connect to the Internet with Outlook, froze up IExplorer, and then, to make matters worse, would not let me either uninstall it or download the Norton remover utility. I struggled with the online help at Norton, fixed all the settings -- no go, and the darn program froze up after every adjustment so I had to reboot repeatedly. I finally got the removal utility off with another computer and voila, all the problems I'd been struggling with disappeared. Bad product, bad service, a waste of the nearly $50 I spent on it."
1,WARNING WARNING,"Highly recommend not installing this on your system. It completely took over my office computers and eliminated internet access, disabled all our printers and cost us almost two weeks of manpower to somewhat restore things to normal.Uninstalling Norton 360 caused extensive damage, we had to reinstall multiple programs.I would like to see a class action lawsuit against them to recover time and wages lost trying to fix the problems they caused."
2,Norton 360,"I have a Vista 64 Ultimate with Intel Dual Core.Literally for the first 3 months of trying, Norton 360 would failduring install. EMails were ignored, but I figured eventually itwould get fixed. After one Live Update, it did install.Now today, 6 months into my contract, Norton 360 decided my trial had run out. There was no way to convince it to go to Symantec to check, so I was forced to uninstall and reinstall. Now it is back to saying 6 months left.Because I reinstalled, the link to my backups is broken, my 2GB of free space is full, and Norton gives no tools to delete those files and free up space.I would pretty much recommend any other product over Norton 360.Robert"
1,Half-baked security software,Norton 360 made me uninstall Norton System Works and doesn't have the full set of System Works functionality. I'd go with Norton Internet Security instead.
1,Rubbish dont buy this,"Norton 360s auto protect keeps turning itself off, despite the fix offered on Symantec's website. As a result a virus recently deleted all my files as the auto protect was off. Would not recommend any of Norton's products, the previous version of Norton 2007 was immensely slow. If you have Norton 2005 or previous versions, then these are quite good, the recent cohort of Norton products is poorly developed."
1,"Will not work with Vista, Do not waste your money!","I just purchased this a few weeks ago for a brand new machine. The first time I tried to run a virus scan it froze the machine, promting a message from Vista of an ""Application crash"". Like other reviewer's ,I wasted day's of time with Symantec with no resolution to the problem and a refusal of a refund. You might as well flush your money down the toilet and save the time and greif."
1,Manure,"This thing is crap. Norton stole money from me. I've had nothing but freezes and all manner of problems since installing this worthless dog. DO NOT spend your hard earned bucks on this piece of crap. It doesn't function and WILL slow down your machine. Junk, garbage and a rip off."
1,Better Alternatives,"Norton 360 does not perform as well as System Works. After running Norton 360, I bought the latest Norton System Works and it found 168 problems in 9 areas. The really sad thing is that Norton 360 'looks' like it is working correctly. If you think 360 is working well, borrow a System Works disk from someone, run it, and you'll see the difference.A second, related problem with Norton 360 is that it doesn't provide you with any feedback, after it is done, you have no idea what happened. Given the hickups with Vista, I prefer to know when files have been successfully downloaded."
1,mad as *ell,"This is the worst software I ever spent money on. My brand new, working fine before 360 computer along with my laptop which is 2 years old was so bogged down with this software. It took simple task like opening filesestimate of 15-20 min. just to open. I also called for help "" I was on hold long enough to cook dinner for a family of six. When they finallyanswered I could barely understand what they were telling me to do at whichtime that didn't work. I uninstalled ""ALL' Norton's software went with another form of protecting. Norton 360 trashed it.""BUYER BEWARE"""
1,Bad software,"This is a bad, bad piece of software. After installing it and running it with default settings, it ate ALL of my memory. I finally figured out that I needed to adjust the settings to run tasks manually. Apparently Norton is so busy working in the background that it forgets to leave room for anything else to run. Then I tried to run Live Update. Won't work. Downloaded and ran the ""fix-it"" tool, which said it was fixed. Reran live update. Still won't work. Told me to run the fix-it tool again. Still didn't work. I'm supposed to call customer support, but software is supposed to WORK. I've already spent at least 10 hours trying to fix this mess. I'll never buy another Norton product again."
1,1 star isnt low enough,"The only thing I've seen norton protect me from was getting work done. When things go wrong with norton product you have two choices: talk to someone who doesnt speak english or take your computer in for service.At the recommendation of a service technician I installed AVG Antivirus, which then found 4 viruses on my machine!If security is your concern then do yourself a favor and uninstall this piece of crapware and install AVG."
1,Garbage,"I'll make it quick - unlike my computer once I installed this garbage.It slowed my computer to a horrible crawl. Whereas before it took a few seconds to open a web page, after I installed this, it took minutes. My productivity went down the drain. I was really surprized that this happened since I had been happy with previous versions of Norton security software.After many calls to Norton's ESL Third World support personnel I finally found out that this software runs in the background . . . . and just keeps on running and running and running.Nevertheless I had faith in Norton and tried to resolve the problem over several weeks by calling ""support"" personnel, installing and uninstalling and installing again. Eventually I passed the statue of limitations for a refund and so I lost my money, unistalled Norton for the last time and put it in the trash can where I normally put my garbage.A real disappointment. Absolutely not recommended."
4,Norton360,"Over all a great product. It does impact startup and shutdown speed. It more than tripled the time it takes for the computer to shut down once you click the shut down button (Windows XP). I do like the features better than other security systems I've tried, however."
1,SYMANTEC NOT REPUTABLE,"Symantec (seller of Nortaon Anti-Virus products) is not a reputable company. I purchased an on-line anti-virus subscription, had difficulty installing it, got fed up and went to McAfee. Symantec refuses to give me a refund. Their customer service is terrible and very hard to reach. It's in India and if you aren't a ""preferred"" customer you will wait at least 30 minutes. I know because I've timed it.McAfee Anti-Virus software was easy to install. Their customer service personnel were very helpful. Go with McAfee and avoid Symantec.Kurt Helmig"
2,not good,"I have been using Norton anti-virus for less than a week. It had an impressive first day, removing a particularly irritating and tenacious bug; otherwise, it's most stunning achievement has been to wipe out my Internet connections, and to provide inadequate instructions for restoring them. Fortunately, I have a family member who can find his way around such problems; otherwise I would have had to spend extra money to pay someone to undo Norton's nuisance. Norton should not be selling a half-developed product."
1,twtex,"This thing is horrible!!! If you buy it you'll just be buying yourself a ton of trouble. I just removed it for the last time after fighting with it for several months trying to get it to work. Like, if you have to reinstall it they will ask for a product number. When you enter the number they have in your account on their website, it will tell you that that's not a valid number. For sure, they really should change the name of their Technical Help Department to Technical Stalling. Norton USED to make fine products. NOT ANYMORE! Something in that company has gone terribly wrong. I'll never buy anything from them again. This has got to be absolutely the worst seventy bucks I have ever spent...."
1,HUGE installation issues; Circuit City technicians couldn't fix it.,"My title says it all! I bought it new at Circuit City, and it WOULD NOT install properly. Circuit City technicians had it for FIVE HOURS; no results. I tried live tech support from Norton THREE TIMES; still no results.I returned it and installed Webroot. It installed perfectly the first time."
1,norton 360 is the worst,very rude programming. This thing would bog down my computer and not allow any kind of shutdown or override. I scheduled all my scans for saturday night at 2a.m. and it would still take over my system during the day. total piece of garbage. forget about getting through to tech support. Unless you make 2 bucks an hour it won't be worth your time to try to get your money back after you uninstall it.
1,Norton 360,"I loaded this software on my laptop and it was a very heavy drain on the computer's resources. Additionally, the software also wreaked havoc with my wirelesss connections to the printer. I was not impressed with this software and I ended up uninstalling it.Norton 360 All-In-One Security Annual Subscription - 3 PCs"
1,This has destroyed my computer,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I wish I had read these reviews before I purchased this product at a local store. Norton 360 has made my computer very difficult to use. I am constanting getting error messages. It will not allow me to go on the internet unless I disable the product. I only gave this product one star because the reviewing system forced me to.
1,Don't Install This!!!,I've used a previous version of Norton with no problems so a few days before my expiration date I installed Norton 360 & it slowed my computer to a crawl. I uninstalled it today & my computer is back to its previous lightening fast speed. Don't bother installing Norton 360...it's crap. I just installed the clearwire security & it's running fine. I wish I had read these reviews before I installed it. But I'll cut my losses...but you...save your money!!!
1,Norton 360 -- a time wasting disaster,"I've now spent 26 hours trying to get this buggy product to work. To no avail. Autoprotect fails and cannot be fixed. Live chat help is worthless, since all they'll tell you to do is remove, reinstall and pray. Inevitably, the product fails again. Caveat emptor."
1,Worthless,"It took me several days of online chat support to get this product installed. When it was finally installed, it did an initial deep scan, and passed the XP box with no sign of infection. The very next boot, it had been entirely disabled by whatever has infected the box. I strongly suggest you look elsewhere for your security needs. However, ZoneAlarm, which used to be an execellent product, may still be worth getting asneta separate product. It was, at one time, the very best firewall, for preventing rouge applications from turning your PC into a robot for some hacker. But, 360 is a very big disappointment. I wish I could give a strong recommendation to another vendor, but I have yet to find a product that finds the bug in my box."
1,Internet Security and Systemworks are a Better Alternative,"Similar to many others, Norton 360 caused serious slowdown and the crashing of Internet Explorer on my Dell desktop (P4 with 1G Ram) and on my daughter's Dell Inspiron m600 laptop--both running Windows XP. I had used Norton Internet Security and Systemworks previously without major problems(Systemworks appears to do more regarding registry cleanup than 360, but can't be used with 360). I have replaced 360 on both computers with Internet Security and Systemworks and the problems have gone away. There seem to be serious problems with 360 for many users, and it is amazing to me that the major tech reviews of this product were so positive."
2,Buyer beware,This product may be OK for virus and spyware prevention. As best as I can tell I haven't had any viruses sneak through. When it comes to something that I can evaluate well i.e. its' backup capability I can say that it is a complete failure. It is difficult to schedule a backup. You cannot backup to a drive on your home network. Online capability is way too slow and too small. When I click -backup now- it fails. It will give a message that I am adequately backed up and when I check the backup file I find that none has been done for 2 weeks.I would suggest looking elsewhere for a program such as this. Ithink that the only reason I still use Norton products is simple inertia.
1,WARNING Don't Buy Norton 360,I decided to buy norton 360 after using Norton products for many years. This software is horrible.1) It has made my cpu extremely slow.2) My system crashed for the first time ever after I loaded it.3) The system scan does not work properly - never completes.4) The check for updates option never completes properly.Don't say I didn't warn you. I'm taking mine off both the machines I loaded it on and its my last symantec product.
1,Your own risk,"Norton 360 is the biggest piece of garbage I have had the displeasure of using. (would not let me rate less then one)I have used Norton Internet security for many years, and had no problem. I have contacted Norton about this issue which they started out trouble shooting with me. Not one of their fix's worked and they have not responded to my last message, or the resending of that message.It will scan fully maybe every 4th time. Every other time it will scan one file for ever(I have stopped it after 12 hours) not the same file every time either, it's random!Click stop scan: it will be stopping forever. It will not allow taskmaster up nor will it allow a shut down with windows software. It will lock everything up to the point that it will take 15 minutes for something you start to appear. The only way to shut down is hit the power. If you buy it enjoy. PS this is a newer computer running XP And it does happen on all three computers."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you search for ""Norton 360 problem"" and make a list of the most frequent problems, I have had all of them in just two months. From Live Update refusing to update, blocking legitimate programs from the internet without any explanation or means of allowing them, the famous ""red X"" problem that never goes away, Auto-Protect refusing to turn on...and all Symantec says is ""reinstall it"". I am on a two-month trip away from home so I can't.On top of it all, my conputer now takes ten minutes to start up. It never took that long before @#$%&*ing Norton 360. I am on the verge of un-installing it and just going unprotected until I can get something else.Don't waste your money. I wish I hadn't."
1,What happened to this company?,"I've been using Norton products since the old 286 days, but the past few releases haven't been pretty. Doesn't matter how much memory I add, my PC, which should run like the hare, crawls along like the tortoise.5 days after installing Norton 360, my computer got infected with the trojan.zonebac virus. Norton says it removed it, but I am still getting porn ads in place of Google Adsense ads. So today I contacted support. Their answer for me was to pay them $90 to have their tech professional remove it. Silly me, I thought Norton was supposed to stop it from infecting my pc in the first place.I should have paid more attention to the reviews here."
2,Slowed down my system,"I recently upgraded my norton antivirus to 360 recently and it has slowed down my PC a lot. Simple tasks like startup, openeing a webpage take forever. There is always some background activity. I tried contacting the Norton support which turned out to be extremely agonising task. Telephone support is available. But, you have to pay for it 10 dollars per issue. For online chat support, you will be placed in queue and finally when somebody answers it, it takes 2-3 minutes for the support to reply. He finally asks you to delete temporary files and restart the PC and if this doesn't work, to call back errrrr.. chat back. This cycle repeats til you get frustrated. Then there will be a followup e-mail from symantec asking if the issue has resolved. When I replied that it has not and asked them to contact me, they simply resent another followup email. I returning this product. I am not sure if it works ok otherwise. But, the support is terrible. So, I am returning it."
1,BUY WINDOWS ONE CARE,"I bought this using the reviews in, I believe Feb. issue, PCMAG. They gave it the best reviews and highest score. According to them it is automatic and will not need my attention(LIE). Well every time something needs to be done I manually have to take care of it myself. I have to update windows myself. I want something that will do everything for me and leave me alone. It slowed my computer down pretty good as well. I then decided to try Microsoft's One care product and I never hear from it except an occasional popup telling me that I need to update windows, and this is a rarity, for optional updates or one that requires a restart.I will never buy a Norton product again. One care is seamless and takes care of everything and you can get it on EBAY for around $10-15 for a year and 3 PC's"
1,"If you have kids, look elsewhere","What kind of shortsighted company would put out a product that doesn't support parental control settings separately for each user on your computer? Of course I want to restrict what my kid sees when using his limited account, but why would I ever want that restriction applied to my account??? Oh, and by the way, the previous Norton Internet Security 2005 DID support parental contol for each user separately!"
1,Don't walk......run from this product - you'll be glad you did!,"I was a faithful Norton user for many years, until their product got so bloated and resource consuming that I gave up about five years ago. After reading glowing reviews about a leaner, completely reworked program, I became intrigued and finally decided to give it another try. What a mistake.The LiveUpdate (upon which the whole anti virus function depends) was broken nearly from the start. After many sessions with tech support (who really seem to be trying - in a losing battle), Live Update was working. Other things stopped working, like backup, and the program became unstable, with random characters scattered in it's dialog boxes. After following tech support's instructions for a complete uninstall and reinstall, viola, Live update was once again not functioning, and backup would crash the entire program.Apparently little has changed at Symantec, releasing what should be early beta software on an unsuspecting public."
1,do not purchase,"I decided to upgrade to Norton 360 and downloaded the program. That was after I called on-line sales because could not delete the extra $10- service fee they kept tacking on to the final price. Long story short, my computer became totally disabled. Could not access secure sites (my bank, broker, gmail and so forth)and removing the program did not help. I finally installed a new Explorer(7) and added the secure sites to ""trusted sites"" on my computer. There is no service telephone number listed on their site but found it through a private site. (800-591-9334). They don't want you to call. I waited 50 minutes on the phone (with horrible music playing). The ""technician"" tried to get me to download the product again and add a ""fix."" I almost did this except my computer was so disabled it could not access the site. Miracle of miracles, I received a refund (or so they said). Do not buy this program!"
1,Worst Product I've Ever Purchased,It is several hours later and I'm still setting up this product. They don't tell you that it takes an entire afternoon to install this thing. There have been so many problems that I wish I had read the reviews here first. Next time I'll buy McAfee.
1,A 360 degree waste of money,"I have already published this comment under Norton 360 (without 3 licenses)Have a look at the 5 people on the product cover:- The Asian old lady on the left is saying that I'm not protected at all since the software doesn't work if you have a ""limited user"" account.- The man with blue shirt is saying I get ccApp.exe errors each time I do shutdown or switch user.- The boy with glasses (started wearing them after installing the product) is anxious to see the result of the 4 hours full system scan that happens every couple of days to eventually find nothing!- The lady on the right is waiting for a window to open since the PC became dreadfully slow (I mean really slow).- Finally, the lady in the middle is saying I'm surrounded by fools who purchased this product and I'm sure not going to be one of them..What a waste of money... I guess I didn't see the cover since I went for online purchase..."
2,Not Recommended,"I was a fool to have purchased this buggy software that prevents me from using my computer the way its intended to. $40.00 from Brick and Mortar store - not that big of a loss. I won't make the same mistake again.If you don't need to use the internet, this is the product for you. On the otherhand, if you use your computer for a variety of internet-related tasks (specifically online banking), DO NOT BUY NORTON!!!(Thankfully I was able to uninstall the software without incident...otherwise it would have gotten 1 star.)"
4,works for what it was intended to do,good virus protection and very convenient for family use since it can be used on 3 PC s ; if it is not 100% protecting then of course the risk will be that you end up with 3 infected PCs.............
1,Trying to get my money back,Norton 360 Version 2.0For Grandma...Can not schedule tasks.Can not control where speed disk places files.Removed Unerase capability.Seems to run the AntiVirus very often.Can not turn off the AntiVirus scan.CcSvcHst.exe will lock up computer from being shut down.CcSvsHst.exe will take over the OS.Removes Norton System Works.
2,"Norton 360 ""Downgrade""","I have used Symantec and Norton products for years, on both Mac and PC. I 'upgraded' from Norton Internet Security Pro to 360, and my computer misbehaved ever since. I had numerous problems with links failing to load (""unable to find server"")requiring multiple refreshes and general slowing of all internet connections all links seemed to have a one to three second delay before loading...I use WinXP and a fast cable modem. I had no real help from customer 'service'...it took 8 days to hear back from their 24 hour response site. The advice was unhelpful and I eventually uninstalled the program. Ta da...everything worked fine!I did go back with Norton Internet Security however, and so far, so good. BTW, the refund process is like pulling teeth on a horse."
1,Don't Buy This!,"I have had more trouble with this software than any other software I have purchased. The online backup is a joke. I bought more online storage space because I received a message saying I needed it, but then I could never get it activated. Whenever I try to backup online, I get a message telling me some of the files could not be backed up. Tech support was useless. My computer has been ""acting up"" ever since I installed this software. Don't buy this product; you'll be sorry if you do."
4,Norton 360 Ver 2.0,"I have just recently upgraded to Norton 360 Version 2. I was running Norton Internet Security 2006 on 2 seperate computers (1.2Ghz laptop and 2.6Ghz desktop.) I can tell you that the install and initial scans take forever. (On the laptop, was over an hour.) However, after installation and all the scans were complete, boot times, downloads, virus scans were all faster with Norton 360 than Norton IS 2006. I have experience with just about every other Antivirus program, (mostly repairing friends computers who swore their programs were better.) I have installed Norton on all my computers and my families computers......and have yet to have a virus infection or system crash. Older versions of Norton tended to hog resources, but I am very happy with Norton 360 ver 2.0."
1,Uugghh!!!!,"My new laptop came with a free version of Norton, which worked great. When the freebie expired, I opted for Norton 360. It worked for about a week. I was eventually unable to run LiveUpdates because of a message saying it is already running. Now, I can't even run my scans or anything else. I am essentially locked out! When seeking support, it tried to fix the problem itself, but gave me an error of some problem with my license. I emailed the support team and accidentally gave them both of my email addresses for this problem. Funny how I got 2 different fixes from 2 different people! Haven't had time yet to try either one! Hopefully one will work. Am seriously considering uninstalling the program and going with something else, but hate to waste the $60.Save your money and go with another program."
5,Great first time skates!!!,"Love these! Comfortable, secure and love that there are 3 stages to adjust forward/backward movement. Great for the price!"
3,Know what you are buying,"We bought these skates after my 6 year old daughter went to a roller rink and wanted skates of her own. They are nothing close to the quality of the rink skates. I didn't expect them to be as good, but I hoped they would be useful. They do not roll very smoothly on any surface that we could find. We tried hardwood floors, concrete, and kitchen carpet. They rolled the smoothest on the kitchen carpet, but they would not roll without being pushed. The wheels are made of hard plastic. My daughter cried in frustration while trying to make these work. For bigger kids, I recommend buying something similar to what the roller rink has for rental.I am going to let my 4 year old have these and hope that she likes them. Since the wheels lock in place for learning to wear them, I will also let my 2 year old try them."
5,Perfect for first skates!!,You can adjust them for size and also to make it that they walk in them to start. These are a great way to start out a little girl on roller skates!
4,Getting back to childhood basics!,"My 2 year old grand daughter is very active which I love. I believe that children are spending too much time in front of the television and that is the reason we have an obesity problem with our nation's youth. Getting back to basics and allowing our children to be active is the answer. Allowing them to enjoy the things ""grandma did back then"" is the ticket. Professionals say skating improves gross motor skills; I say the increase fun! These skates allow me to encourage the next generation to get an early start on leading a healthy, active lifestyle!"
4,Good First Skates,"I bought these skates for my five year old daughter. She wanted ""big girl"" skates like her sister, but I couldn't find any to fit her toddler size feet. This pair works well. They don't go as fast as her sister's, but that's probably the point of ""my first"" skates."
5,The greatest Atomic Movie Ever,"This video provides so much awe and amazement toward the power of nuclear weapons. Anyone can find themselves watching it, jaw-dropped and tense. Along with dramatic sound and excellent footage, you'll watch it more than twice."
5,An impressive documentary,"With impressive detail and incredible footage, this has to be one of the most exceptional documentaries ever produced on the subject of the atomic bomb."
2,The Rain Comes Down But That's Just About All,"The pictures are glorious; however, the story is extremely disappointing. There is no real conflict and thus no conflict resolution - which is so important to the little ones. The rain does, indeed, come down, but that's just about all that happens. Unfortunately, this latest book by Mr. Shannon does not measure up to his wonderfully delightful David series or his great cautionary tale, A Bad Case of Stripes - all of which bring a great big smile to my heart just thinking about them."
1,"Lazy, Exploitative, Fanboy Nonsense","Life, apparently, is unfair to Wesley Gibson. Oppressed by his wimmenfolk and talked down to by his various minorities, he dresses like a tool and feels sorry for himself. Then, kazam. He turns out to be a supervillain.Wesley reacts to his new powers by raping and murdering his way to the top of his supervillain game without a single hesitation. I think there may have a moment or two where he stopped and tried to generate some empathy, but I probably blinked and missed them. Fortunately, he's surrounded by a cast of equally vapid monsters, with nary a bit of depth between them.Wesley is a dweeb as a mundane human, but as a supervillain he's actually one of the most genuinely unlikeable characters in comic history. I imagine that I've missed the post-modern/ironic twist, but I wasn't going to go rooting through it in this pile of nihilistic fanboy trash."
1,unoriginal and uninteresting,"This is yet another tale of the painfully average guy who is suddenly given the chance to realize his true destiny through super powers. The difference here is that the main character is to become a 'bad guy', with the potential to be the baddest of the bad guys. It sounds like a good set up for an interesting story, but it disappoints because the only thing the book has to offer is shock value. The main character goes from dead end loser to mass murderer & rapist. There was definite potential for black humor here, but the story never got that clever. The story has lots of brutal killing, the occasional reference to rape for fun, lots of swearing, etc - but if those things aren't original or shocking to you then I think you'll be as bored and as disappointed as I was."
2,Not impresed,There was so much potential for this story but in my opinion it was executed badly. The story moves way to fast and the plot is very predictable. However the art is pretty nice.
2,Not so Wanted,"Jones' art is great and I really sympathize with what the author is doing, but I do not think that Millar's story is focused enough and detailed enough to warrant his harsh conclusion. The set-up of how the office drone becomes the super-villan is far too perfunctory and it becomes entirely lost in the sub-plot of the war among the super-villans. I think that if the book is going to pull-off its about-face ending, the reader needs to be significantly more co-opted by Wesley Gibson's transformation, significantly more sympathetic to him despite his abject degredation. Instead of just dropping hints to the depths of perversity in this world, the story should have shown them off. As it is, Millar is in too much of a rush to shove it all back in the reader's face to set his trap sufficiently. Good idea - poor execution."
3,An Epanded What If?,"Wanted is a story about of a world without super heroes told through Wesley Gibson tinted glasses. In essence, this is a What If? told over six books. I enjoyed this book so much more than the Movie, which is why I bought the book in the first place.I am a firm in the belief that no medium should ever insult its audience, and *SPOILER ALERT* that is exactly what the last few panels of this book do. I understand the reasons and usefulness, much like the rest of this book, it is dificult to swallow. I found some plot holes inexcsuable, like what was the point of introducing cape, it never becomes an element of the plot.I do not read the Ultimates regularaly but I did appreciate Millar's departure from that writing style. If I had to make a final recomendation I would say read this if you're interested in a book that departs from the normal Super Hero book, use this as a palate cleanser to delve deep into the darker side of comics."
4,"Wanted: Awesome, because it accomplishes what it sets out to do...","The goal of this book is to be as vulgar, violent, and politically incorrect as possible. And...I love it for this reason. The storyline is a little choppy, but I don't know how else Millar could have done this. You'll have to read it to see what I mean. The art is amazing, the idea is great, and I crack a smile/chuckle on almost every page. Definitely worth reading."
3,Your mileage may vary,"Reviews on this are pretty polar; I liked this with some notable exceptions which I will detail here.It's a good story with some interesting characters, but the ending left me with a ""is that all?"" feeling. Having said this, the journey is a lot of fun.The art is good, with a great many old school touches that I appreciate, but the main characters Wesley and Fox, resemble Eminem and Halle Berry to the point of distraction. Also, their diction is detailed with curse words to the point of ridiculousness. Adult language is great, but some restraint here would have served the book better."
2,Graphic SF Reader,"A look at life from the supervillain side. A young man discovers he is the child of one of the supervillains that rule the world, having teamed up years ago to beat the superheroes in a 'crisis'.Starts off ok and deteriorates quickly, as he quickly moves out of his crappy job and gets rid of his cheating girlfriend.He learns his talent is shooting, and by shooting, shooting the wings off moving flies, that sort of good.Unfortunately, the promising start wanes quickly."
1,Boring.,"For better or worse, the book has very little in common with the film based on it. Don't expect a similar story to the movie.I was excited to dig in to Wanted after glancing at some of the elaborate artwork, but was disappointed to find a lack of depth or anything actually interesting. When a book primarily aimed at exploring every carnal desire you could think of can actually be called boring, it's pretty clear that this is a book that misses the mark completely. No lesson is learned, no characters are developed, no point is made at all - Wanted feels more like a chore than a fun read.Great artwork wasted on a weak story and boring characters."
2,Juvenile and gratuitous,"Reads like a high schooler's creative writing project - ""I can include profanity and sex, isn't that cool! So every other word will be a profanity! Yeah!"" Unfortunately, the result is sophomoric, predictable, and lacking any sophistication. The art is ok (a poor man's Brent Anderson), but the focus on gory close-ups and leaking brains makes it clear the intended audience is 16 year olds who need a quick read between Halo games. Very disappointing."
4,A fun story of anti-heroics,At times the creators of Wanted get a little caught up in what might be their own pretensions. However the story moves along pretty well with enough unadulterated violence to keep it colorful. Obviously this book is meant for a mature crowd but older audiences might not appreciate the cynicism.
2,Not as cool as it thinks it is,"Mark Millar has turned out some amazing comics like The Ultimates & Superman: Red Son. But I wasn't a fan of Wanted. It's the basic Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter story, only this time the main character is a supervillain. Interesting premise. But Millar's writing here too consciously influenced by Fight Club and Eminem. There were times when I downright hated this comic. The last page is a perfect example. Millar lays on the nihilism so thick that it doesn't take long to get tedious. The casual attitude towards rape is also disturbing.J.G. Jones is the book's saving grace. While it's annoyingly obvious that Halle Berry and Eminem are visual references for the 2 main characters, the rest of the cast are interesting takes on DC villains. The coloring is often a bit too muddy, though.For a much better take on supervillains check out Brian K. Vaughn's The Hood from Marvel Max."
4,A great read,Having run across a reference to the graphic novel I picked this up. The artwork is incredible and the story line is well done. The anti-hero theme is one that's been done before but they managed to make a great new version that's not overly mythical or buried in mysticism or philosophy.
4,What if the Supervillains Won?,"That very misleadingly simple question is the basis of a captivating narrative by Mark Millar (co-creator of Kick-Ass) and JG Jones of Final Crisis. Millar's work is often biting and most importantly fun to read. Admittedly this is a more polarizing work with many divided on whether or not to fully support the protagonist Wesley Gibbons. While beginning the story as an everyman character Gibbons shifts quickly into the supervillian his father always wanted him to be. This is not meant to be a moral guide, as Superman typically is. Instead Millar and Jones create a character study into what supervillains are truly like. Giving readers a fun romp that veers from showing villains that are DC/Marvel analogues to a bloody shoot em up.THe only thing that holds the series a little down is an ending loaded with exposition."
5,Great but not for everyone,"Generally people who are uncomfortable with taking insults for their hobbies and fanboi-isms are generally going to dislike this book. There is an interesting universe constructed here, with a fairly interesting plot, and through the sex and violence there is deeper meaning here as well. But most people won't see it, they will focus on one aspect or another. I think to enjoy it, you have to appreciate all parts of it. Not unlike enjoying A Clockwork Orange (the novel or the film), there is definitely a message from writer, and it's meant to shake you from a sleepy modern life rather than lull you into a happy place."
1,Disappointed,Much happier with the movie than the source material. I do not recommend this graphic novel.
1,Wanted (paperback),"My son saw the movie preview, and thought the book would be something cool to have. I ordered it for him for Christmas and was very disappointed with it. It's contents are vulgar and discusting.I would not recommend this for an adult, let alone a teenager. However, I have had great customer service on my return of this book with Oxworth books."
1,NOT wanted,"This piece of rubbish has a clever setup which goes nowhere interesting after Wesley turns into a super-villain (early in the book). The setup posits a world where murder, rape, etc. (on any scale) goes unpunished, and the notions of guilt or remorse never arise. This makes a mockery of the idea that this is an 'adult' story, or even 'edgy'.The artwork is good, there's plenty of violent action, blood, guts, profanity, and dark humour. A cheering adolescent may feel a bit conned however since there's almost no sex."
1,Waste of time,"This was a waste of my time to read this thing. Its message was that life sucks, and its mode of communicating that was by showing a bunch of people getting raped and shot and dying and whatnot.I hated this piece of garbage and don't recommend it to anybody."
1,Morally Repugnant,"The trade is introduced by Brian Vaughan, ironically he says ""At their worst, superhero stories are just dopey male power fantasies, but at their best, these myths don't just entertain, they work as powerful allegories that help us understand who we are."" In my opinion ""Wanted"" falls firmly in the former category... or it would except 'dopey' implies a level of harmlessness that ""Wanted"" lacks.This is the story of a thoroughly unlikable loser who gets the sort of life he couldn't even dream about before by picking up a gun and killing everyone he dislikes or who got in his way. Plus some random by-standards just for the heck of it. It's a book about killing lots of people while looking cool and feeling no remorse. It's a glorification of the sort of thinking that leads to high school shootings."
1,Wanted.....to be erased from memory,"I picked this book up because of the hype it was getting at the time but this is just awful. If foul language & violence is supposed to equal a good story then I guess I missed the punchline. Millar's work for Marvel Comics' ""Civil War"" & Icon's ""Nemesis"" books are so much better than this. ""Superman Red Son"" is Millar at the top of his game. But this? This was a total waste of time."
4,Better than the feature film,"Fair warning: this comic is quite a bit more graphic and major elements were changed for the motion picture.This is a fine example of the book being better than the movie for 3 reasons. First off,the story delves way deeper into the comic book world. Unlike the film, there are several allusions to superheroes (including Superman) in this book. Second, the casting is way better - they use Eminem and Halle Berry lookalikes for the main characters and I must say I wish they were in the movie instead. Lastly, the writing is gritty, obscene at times, and passionate."
2,Dumb,You either you love it or hate it. I didn't like it. It was over the top violence with no story line. Every page was like reading youtube comments.
4,Good product for nasal itching,If you have allergies and suffer from dry itchy nasal passages this product really helps. It relieves symptoms almost immediately.
4,Ponaris Nasal Emollient,"Good product. I use it to keep my nose lubricated at night.I need to add eight more words, so here they are. (Sheesh)"
3,Didn't work for me.,"That's not to say that it couldn't help others, but it didn't help me at all with my congestion.The main reason that I gave it three stars is that it's expensive for such a small bottle, and the results were less than ideal."
2,Smell really starts to get irritating and won't go away,"I got this stuff after reading so much about it and with the hype and all about how astronauts used it or whatever. Well, it seems fairly legit, but is smells like pine needles mixed with dirt.So, your nasal cavity is going to have a strong smell of pine needles mixed with dirt and for a long time throughout the day! I suggest you save your money and get sesame oil. Costs a heck of a lot cheaper and works REALLY well."
5,amazing product!,"for dry cough and dry sinuses this is the cure.....for cpap users we suffer from dry sinuses and throat from constant air pressure during sleep. this caused me to have a dry wheezing caugh i could not get rid of, until ponaris. after 2 or 3 days of use, dry cough and wheezing gone, sinuses feel much better. this stuff should be in every pharmacy across the country!"
5,This stuff works!,A while back I suffered from frequent nosebleeds. I was treated by an ENT doctor with several cauterizations. She also wanted me to keep my nostrils moist at night. She suggested Ponaris. Well it helped me heal and I have used it every night since and have had no further problems with nosebleeds.Bottom line; doctor recomended and effective!
4,Ponaris helps for my nose condition,I try ponaris from the sample of my nose doctor. It help me to get less mucus. I feel my nose condition is better after I use it. I can't get it from drug stores and supper markets. I hope ponaris shows on the shelf of drug store.
4,great product,"This product was suggested by a doctor, an ENT, for lubricating my airways. I have found it effective. The combination of essential oils opens airways, and has a pleasant fragrance."
4,Ponaris,Ponaris Nasal Emollient if very helpful in soothing irritated nasal passages. It was recommended to me a few years ago by my ENT doctor. Very helpful
5,Very nice,"An ENT surgeon recommended this product to me. I used to suffer from frequent nosebleeds in the winter, but after using this product, I have no more nosebleeds."
5,Wonderful,I second the review by Maximus Scriptorius. I would also like to note that M.S. is being very humble. He doesn't mention that he has produced a facsimile of the 1582 printing of the Rheims New Testament and of the 1635 printing of the Douay Old Testament. His is a photographic reproduction of these printings in the old script and the old spelling. It makes a wonderful companion to Dr. Von Peter's transcripted version. I own both.
1,Pure Crap,"Buying this book is a waste of good money. I enjoy reading fiction, I love authors like Eric Harry, Richard Herman, Coyle, and Larry Bond. But this guy is none of these. This book is terrible. If you want to read a riviting narrative of how a submarine goes up, down, left, or right, or how such a machine can travel at unheard of speeds under the water, then this is the book for you. I've never been so bored and disappointed by a story supposedly about WWIII in my life. Return to Oz is a more believable tale than this book presents. And the errors in sentence structure, doesn't this man know what an editor is? I mean, ""He speaks"" what the heck kind of dialoge is that? Is this a book or a screenplay? And the ending! The only good thing about the ending of this book is that it ENDED!!! The true disaster of this work is that it was actually published. Learn how to write and learn how to tell a story."
3,"Good plot, butttt...","I have read every WWIII book ever created, i think that for people who enjoy the WWIII scenario this book is not bad. The writing is a little primitive, but the pace is good. I would have liked the author to develop a little more substance on the issue's in this book. the biggest thing that bugs me is how the Islamic armies could have occupied Israel without Israel obliterating every square inch of muslim land with nuclear weapons. it really drives me nuts. any country in the world that possesses nuclear weapons would never allow itself to be conquered without destroying it's opponents country first"
1,Weak plot...not overly plausible,"Understandably this is an action thriller only type of book and should not be expected to live to the works of Coyle or Clancy, but there is little to zero development of any of the characters. The plot is not one that anyone could take serious...how many Islamic carrier battlegroups were there??? Not to mention the relationship between the CO and XO leads towards an opinion that our Armed Forces are unprofessional.The cover alone should have said something for what I was about to read...a bad digital picture blown-up even worse from some website.Sorry people, I do not recommend this book,. It was a disappointment even for someone who is into books for action alone."
2,No finished,"This was strange book. It was short but had some very exciting sequences. However, it appeared that the author got bored with what he was writing and just stopped the book mid stream with no ending. Had he written a full 400-500 pages he would have had a winner for readers of this genre up there with Clancy and Coyle"
2,Is there a young adolescent category?,"Because this is where this belongs.There are the glimmers of a good story in here (Think: a house potentially, when you see the concrete piers sticking out of the ground).Mr Fulgham needs the support of some pro's (which is a common feature in the techno thriller area). Larry Bond & Patrick Larkin to name just 2 - LB started out as Tom Clancy's writing partner (just not on the cover) and then PL started out as LB's (unacknowledged on the cover) partner.He also needs to go back and re-visit both his area of expertise and the wider military community as well.Essentially it reads like the outlines I did of high school essays - a lot of points loosely coupled, awaiting the ""fleshing out"".As it stands, it is just a very large waste of money."
1,Stupid Freakin Book,"This book spent more time talking about the love affair between the captain and a female subordinate then actual combat. When it finally gets to the combat portion the events, weapons and tactics are absurd."
1,Just not good,"There is just no way the countries in the middle east can develop the naval assets that are accounted for in this book. It is pretty much a slam-bam action novell, and if made into a film would deserve actors rated somewhere around the Wings Hauser - Steven Segal level. Don't think your going to get another Red Storm Rising here, more like watching FOX and playing battleship at the same time."
2,Weak,"This book is not a great choice. Weak plot, includes a no-interest romance and basically just stop in the middle.Only if you have nothing else to read imho."
3,Flashlight with some major flaws,"My first and the most accurate impression, I think, was that this flashlight is over bulky and overweight for poor light and functionality it provides. Prefocused lens for very short (or very long with little center spot) lighting distances doesn't do very good job of distributing light evenly in the beam. Beam is divided on at least 4 brightness layers separated by dark rings with very little, and very bright center spot that makes too big contrast with the rest affecting viewing perception. I did also comparison with 2 ""D"" size cell industrial and 2 ""AA"" cell MAG flashlights. It's little brighter than MAG and much darker than 2 ""D"" one. Overall, average performance with very good casing that doesn't justify its high price."
1,Piece of crap.,Don't buy it. Worked good for a couple of months and then it would only work on one of the brightness settings. Soon after that it would not work at all. I like the on button on the back like their base model which I have and still works.
2,no wonder they are out of business...,"It doesn't charge batteries as fast or as deep as the built-in charger in the Powerbook. I averaged around 56% charge, 72% max with this external charger... the built-in would attain 100%"
2,"Great pictures, little else.",I was looking for a book with more than 7 plans in it although it does have lots of fun pictures of all different styles of playhouses. There are several websites to check but it was not what I was hoping for.
2,Misleading Title -,"This is a picture book with a few ""plans"" but does not contain details necessary to undertake a building project. If you want to look at photographs so that you can get some ideas, than this book will be helpful. If you want a book to guide you through the steps necessary to construct a playhouse - this is not the one."
3,"Ideas Yes, Plans No","Basically a pictures only book of professional designed and built playhouses. Some of the photos are of poor quality and should not have been included. Forget about the Plans part, they are mediocre at best. You may find inspiration in the photos, but I was underwhelmed with the purchase."
2,Good as a picture book,"This will give you creative ideas on different playhouses, but it won't show you how to build them. Out of 50 or so pictures, only 2 or 3 have plans; and general plans at that."
5,a classic game of fun,"I was very please with the vendor, they supported prime which is a plus, and it arrive quickly, and in perfect condition!"
5,Carefully-Observed Insanity For Connoisseurs,"This book is a cruel masterpiece of cynical and nasty slapstick humor. The protagonists, the Bullards and the Beelers, are both families of barely sentient wit who behave in ways that are competely understandable, completely human, and completely stupid. Berger's writing and plotting, though, are first-rate-- I laughed out loud throughout this thing, and I've read it three times over the last 25 years (time to read it again). You've met people like this before in the works of Flannery O'Connor, Faulkner, Charles Portis, and Erskine Caldwell, but Berger's light touch makes ""The Feud"" a real find."
1,"Quoted from ""Not My Kid""","""Training a child not to use drugs is not unlike housebreaking a pet. If the newspaper across the bridge of the nose comes at the right time, the pet soon makes the association between the ""fwap"" on the nose and the action. Children need such rudimentary training where drugs are concerned.""Child abuse is not an effective method of treatment for children suffering from drug addiction or mental illness.Children are not pets. I can not fathom how the intentional, premeditated infliction of pain can have anything but a detrimental effect on a child. Perhaps this theory quoted from the book explains the countless accusations of child abuse and physical assault by victims of Miller Newton and his ""treatment"" programs."
1,Great product but not at this price,"I purchased this product directly from Amazon at a cost of under six dollars, and have reviewed it on Amazon. It works very well, and I gave it five stars.The reason for this one star review is to prevent an unsuspecting consumer from purchasing this product from a seller who is currently charging five times as much as Amazon for the exact same thing."
1,An excellent text made useless by publisher BiblioLife - BiblioBazaar,"This is an excellent,comprehensive text book on geometry by outstanding American scholar William Chauvenet. However, publisher (BiblioLife - BiblioBazaar) did a real bad job in this book - print is too small for reading, and sketches are really difficult to see... there was ample space available though...read similar comments about BiblioLife - BiblioBazaar from another reviewer in Amazon... had to return this book for lack of readability."
3,EAT AT WHITEY'S,"SO SO NOT WHAT I HOPE FOR, SOME OF HIS MUSIC LIKE ""SAVING GRACE"" HE CAN BE SO GOOD SOMETIME"
1,Misleading ad,"For those looking to purchase the cartoon ""Family Dog"", you will be very disappointed in this package. These are ""dog movies"", with Lassie, Rin Tin Tin, Yellow Dog, etc. All fine and dandy if dog movies is what you are expecting to receive."
4,Simple but good,"I really love this movie. The story is simple, but heartfelt. Crystal Kwok is just beautiful and wonderful as a recently graduated young girl who returns to her village in rural China, and grapples with whether she should believe in Jesus or be part of the political system. She wavers one way and then the other, asks difficult questions and is sceptical of the answers until the abuses of the political system drive her to faith."
1,what next?,"My husband wanted this item thinking it would remove inches from his waistline, it did it moved everything up....this is like the girdles from the 50's just reshuffle the fat.....works best for self image......."
3,6-inch powerband rolls down on me after bending and sitting.,"The product design is generally good, but I don't think the 6-inch powerband is enough for a tall person. I am 6'2"" and it kept riding down on me after normal stooping, sitting or bending. It would probably work fine on a shorter person. I have since tried the 10 inch powerband with better results."
3,Good but not great product....,"This under-garment is ok for what it does; but is certainly no bargain at the price. In my opinion, it should sell for 8 or 10 dollars - MAX!Additionally, the zipper is of poor to medium quality and will surely pull open eventually, rendering the product useless. Imagine all the stress on a tiny zipper try to hold in your entire fat tummy! Physics, my dear. Simply physics."
5,back support,"I needed this because I took up tennis again and my back was killing me. It was a great help and lessened my back pain significantly. It worked so well, I dont need to wear it everytime I exercise now. Its true, the zipper doesnt help to tighten things up, but, as a whole, this garment is a great support belt...."
4,This is the TV series version.,"A word of warning, this is not the old movie ""Northwest Passage"" starring Spencer Tracy. This is a later TV series version with different actors and stories. However, both are solid adventures on the 18th century frontier of the pre-Revolutionary War colonies. The heros predictably find their way out of trouble in a variety of situations as was standard for the 1950's."
5,Kid clips Radio,"I got this for my daughter, who is 3. She just loves it. She can easy change to clips by herself and sings along with her favorites. The problem is finding more kid clips for it."
4,Wrong Picture,"Just a heads up, the picture is wrong. The product is what the title says Edelbrock 4207 Elite Series Round Air Cleaner. I ordered it hoping it was the air cleaner and it was, they just have the picture wrong. The air cleaner is great as most Eldelbrock product are. Anyway, just thought I'd let people know that the product name is correct."
2,Disappointing Scratch-and-Sniff,"Very disappointed in this scatch and sniff book. Smells were almost non-existent, very weak, and if you could smell the item, it didn't even smell like what it was supposed to be. Plus, the scratch and sniff area was about the size of a nickle, way too small for my toddler to easily scratch, let alone find. Don't waste your money."
3,"Going, going....gone.","This is a nice easy reader book for my 6 year old daughter. The scratch n sniff was a fun added bonus. It worked well & had very accurate scents...but only for one reading. The second time she picked up the book to read & scratch she was very disappointed that the scents were gone. Don't expect it to last long. But on the other hand, it's a fun book that she still enjoys reading. If you can find this book on sale--great. Don't bother otherwise."
3,Don't buy it for the scratch and sniff.,"My son likes Biscuit books so I went ahead and got this book. But all the other reviews are correct. I don't know why they bothered with the scratch and sniff. Half of them don't smell at all and some of the ones that do, smell terrible. If there is a cheaper version of this book without the scratch and sniff, get that one instead."
3,Biscuit's Christmas,I ordered this for my granddaughter for Christmas - Unfortunately itdidn't arrive until much later and I will keep it for next Christmas.
5,Keeps you thinking,"I currently run a rock climbing school here in the Black Hills of South Dakota, and before that I was a Wilderness Ranger so I spend plenty of time hiking and working outdoors. I must say that this book offers up the tools to capture the spirit of what it is to know and love the wilderness you spend a lifetime getting to know. Some might dis John for providing all the natural history, and I must admit, I was not sure I was going to make it through the first chapter, but after that it's an easy read with plenty of food for thought. Read the book on a rock climbing vacation in Mexico and looked forward to reading a few chapters every night. Profoundly entertaining without being the ""pure drivel"" that so many stories are. Beware, this book might make you think about your relationship with mother nature."
4,the GOLDEN spruce,A gr8 history of old growth forests in the NW with excellent look into the life of the BC lumber industry b4 the change of the last century and the Haida Indians.
3,Literary license should be revoked,"John Vaillant is an excellent writer. He is able to weave together disparate details into a comprehensive historical perspective. He does that well in this book. If you weren't interested in the Pacific Northwest or its trees before reading this book, you will be by the time you finish it. My only beef with Vaillant is that he is prone to exaggeration and hyperbole. He gets all of the basic historical facts straight and makes them engaging to the reader. But in the process, he will magnify certain details until they no longer resemble the truth. Endnotes on these exaggerated (if minor) details are lacking, and that is telling. Some might call this a writer's flourish, or literary license, but such hyperbole calls the rest of his research into question. Vaillant is trying to make history read like a novel, but he needn't exaggerate the truth to grab the reader; truth, after all, is more interesting than fiction."
4,No more paper towels for me.,"After finishing this book I felt like booking a trip to British Columbia to see some of what remains of the precious forests Vaillant describes. Warning: This book will make you question your consumption habits and your personal culpability in the destruction of North American forests. If you read it, be prepared for a shock. Few of us outside the logging industry know just how much has been lost. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is entertaining, informative and motivational without being preachy or condescending."
3,Important work,"My entire book club thought this was an important work for the extensive research on the history of the west coast region, particularly in regards to the Haida people, the greed that decimated sea otters, beaver, and the forests of the North American continent. It was not an easy read due to all the details. The story of the Golden Spruce is a sad one; a unique life that cannot be replicated/replaced."
4,good picture of primitive place,"Having travelled in the area I found the description of setting and characters very reminiscent of what I know to be there. Good story but the fifth star is withheld because of pools of distraction here and there in the book. I suspected that the story needed to be ""plumped up"" to make it book length rather than a short story.Pictures and map greatly appreciated. Grant Hadwin is a fascinating person to read about though misguided in some of his impulses and actions. The reader grows to care about him--and the tree!"
2,A valiant attempt,"As soon as I started the book I thought, this reads like a National Geographic article. Sure enough, when I looked at the author notes, I saw that Valliant has written for NG. Which is precisely the problem with the book. He has used the story of the Golden Spruce like a hook to hang a number of science articles on. As for madness and mayhem, the actual culprit becomes a ghost in the book, a sketched out caricature used as an excuse to give the reader a geology lesson.Valliant loves facts, and if this was a textbook it would be above average in readability, but it purports to be something more, and in that it fails."
1,Too old style tennis,"I am very dissappointed after receiving this book.This book teached only classical style(ex. only easternforehand grip)If you want to play tennis just for fun, then buy this book.BUT if you want to play well , forget this book, get lessonsfrom a modern tennis teaching pro."
3,Value for Money??,"Why can WOC produce giant red and black dragons a reasonable price, but smaller red dragons hard to get? My belief is that is all marketing. It's all done to make the next addition of D$D ED4 more like the mini game."
5,More miniature goodness!,"Like the other miniatures from WOTC, these are highly detailed and are a great addition to the D&D roleplaying game."
3,Random?,"Although Amazon replaced one that I received due to the bottom access to the ""huge"" figure being already open (which is a tactic used by people in-store to find the more attractive ""huge"" figures""), I'm still skeptical of the randomness of these boxes. I've continually gotten repeats without ever getting any of the more interesting Huge figures.Otherwise, the figures themselves are great. I really like having the huge figure in there to give the set something interesting in comparison to some of the other mini sets."
4,I like!,These minis are very nice. I really love the huge one's there fun to collect. But I hate how they are so random.
4,Very beatiful,"The images are very nice, most in B&W;, but you can easily see the amazing details from each piece.The pages are bright and colorfull."
1,Not Good,We was Doug at a concert and liked his work. This CD had only two tracks we liked. Very disappointing!!
3,"cool, but could be better made","I metallica rulez!!!, this beanie is cool, keeps my head warm through the cold winter. My only complaint is it shrinks alot after one or two washes and the color fade fast too. Needs to be made better!!"
1,jersey shame rock,"This bands second album is a miserable collection of songs. It's one CD that remains to be a coaster of uninspired material that drowns out all hope. Bionic it is not, sorry guys."
4,Not as advertised,"This is a good amp for the price but Amazon has it listed as a 2ch amp but the model being sold is actually a 4ch amp (TS960-4). The 2ch amp Power Acoustik makes similar to this one is model TS980-2 which does come with the remote dash mount bass knob control. Model TS960-4 does not come with the remote knob. Instead of using the amp for 2 subs in the rear as I had had planned, I'm using it to run a 6.5"" component system and 2 6.5 midbass woofers."
4,Master of Dragons,The condition of the book and cover are excellent. Shipment was timely. A++ That's the review of the seller. I haven't read the book yet.HN-Texas

WHAT HAPPENS IN THIS BOOK IS VEN FINDS OUT HE IS NOT ALONE, DRACONAS CAN TAKE THE APPERANCE OF A LITTLE GIRL, ANORA IS IN ON THE PLOT TO INSLAVE MANKIND, MARCUS'S FATHER ACCEPTS HIM FOR WHO HE IS, AND SETH IS BROUGHT BACK (JUST ONE CHAPTER IN THE WHOLE BOOK), AND EVELINA GETS WHAT SHE WANTS AND HER JUST DESERTS."
4,ENTERTAINING,"I FOUND THE ENTIRE TRILOGY VERY ENTERTAININGAND ENJOYED THE FINALE- ""MASTER OF DRAGONS"".I FOUND MYSELF THOROUGHLY WRAPPED UP IN THECHARACTERS & OF COURSE- WITH THE WRAP UP & HAPPYENDING."
5,Can you be a mystic and still pay your bills on time,"Yes ! according to Jim Rosemergy. This book not only allows, but encourages you to test well known prosperity principals. I especially liked the ""40 day guide."""
1,Out-dated edition,"Beware! The Kindle edition of this book is seriously out-dated. The current print book was published in 2009 (the 4th edition). The Kindle edition is from 2003, six years earlier! My urologist said, ""Be sure you get the current edition."" I would have ordered it for my Kindle so I could start reading immediately, but I started comparing the two books and discovered that the Kindle edition was an old edition, not the one I should be reading. I'm submitting this warning to keep people from buying old, out-dated material. The subject is too serious to be reading out-dated material. As it is, the print book is now two years old, but do you want to be reading material from eight years ago? Shame on Amazon and the publisher for trying to pawn off old material."
4,Prostate & Cancer,"This is a very informative book which brings together information we had gleaned from multiple sources. It also went into a deeper discussion of the diagnosis and treatment options. Although it got a little repetitious at times, the information concurred with what we were advised by our urologist."
4,Good Info,This is a good book that details lots of information and possiblities. It needs to be updated as the treatment options are changing rapidly for this disease.
3,Not my favorite on this topic,"Contrary to other readers, I didn't appreciate this book quite as much as Prostrate Cancer for Dummies. Some of the advice was in conflict with other sources, and I was really concerned with the section that suggested it was kosher to return to the diagnosing urologist for the surgery. Skill and experience are critical for this surgery - I think you should find the best (and forget about professional courtesy). I also felt like the author tended to be arrogant with his opinions. Just my opinion, but I wish I had gotten Walsh's book which I've seen recommended on multiple support sites. I am very happy, though, with the Prostate Cancer for Dummies book which I found to be upbeat and easy to understand."
1,Biased and inaccurate,"While this book provides much information that is helpful and accurate, and in a good Q&A format, readers should know that the author has a clear bias towards surgery versus other approaches and includes some misinformation. For patients trying to get objective, unbiased information to make reasonable choices between RP (surgery), RT (usually brachytherapy for early stage), or active surveillance, this is not a helpful resource. In particular, the author appears unaware of the use of active surveillance for younger patients with low Gleason sum, low PSA, and early stage -- surveillance that, despite what the author says, does include biopsies every six months (preferably with more than 12 cores) as well as PSA and digital exam several times a year. There are better books and better information out there. Google the topic and find recent articles in Oncology magazine (October 2009)."
5,As for the uninformed comments of UVa student Anna....,"the only things I find ""ridiculous"" here are her comments. As a UVa alumna who actually took Dr. Rhoads class...and still finds it to be one of THE most thought-provoking, informative, and important exercises in critical thinking I have been involved in...I am glad that there are men like Dr. Rhoads teaching at my University and disappointed that there are students like Anna."
1,"An evangelical in ""research"" clothing.","He manages to do nothing but try to reinforce the same sterotypes about the sexes of Gray and Gurian.The same tiredmyths ""men look for beauty"" and women ""power,money and strength"" are a theme of the book.I have read many books aboutgender and they smack of agenda and recycling of sterotypes.Don't waste your money.Better yet don't waste your mind on thisnonsense.The right wing has an agenda to keep the status quo,to undermine women and keep all men in the shackles of power even if they don't want it in many individual cases.He doesn't want women to have any aggression,power or status and usesmyths to help his sorry cause."
2,I love this guy,"I love Chris Caffery's work with Savatage and TSO.. But his solo projects always leave me a little flat. Caffery is a very talented musician, one would think his efforts would shine a lot more on his albums. But it just comes out to be straight ahead, uneventful power metal. The same holds true with former band mate Jon Oliva.. his first solo album was pretty good, after that, it all turned into poinless screaming, banging and zippy guitars. No one expects Caffery and former company to release carbon copy Savatage music.. But it would be nice to see them put some magic into their solo projects.. They can do it, why settle for less?"
1,Pins And Needles CD !,"Pins And Needles Is Right-When Listening To It, Your Walking On Pins And Needles From It's Aweful Sound !!! I Love Savatage-John Oliva's Pain-Circle II Circle-Trans-Siberian Orchestra-Chris Caffery's Albums ""Faces"" ""Music Man EP"" And W.A.R.P.E.D. Is An O.K. Album-But This Album Is Total Crap !! Chris Return To Your Roots Or Go Bankrupt With New Albums Such As This !!!"
1,This is a 220V only UPS - WILL NOT WORK ON 110V,This is a 220V only UPS. It will not work on a 110V circuit. This is not mentioned anywhere in the Amazon description. The front of the included manual mentions 110V/220V/240V but the back of the device only shows 220V as the input and output voltages. All I can manage is a little beep noise when pressing the power button on the front.
3,Still not what I need,This was stil too large for the use I had in mind. I REALLY liked the product that the company discontinued. BIG MISTAKE!
1,"Seems nice, but you can do much better","If you are buying a headlamp I highly recommend getting one with LED lights such as this one. An LED lamp is bright, uses less energy, and just lasts longer. However due to the style of batteries this lamp uses, it can only give you 8 hours of light, and the batteries aren't cheap. I went to my local sporting goods store and found another lamp for the same price that takes 3 AAA batteries, and lasts for 100 hours."
2,Superficial coverage,"A pretty typical Lonely Planet Guide, with good practical information on travel through the region.The problem with the book is that it barely skims the surface of most of the destinations it covers. (If it isn't clear from the title, ""Western Balkans"" translates to the nations that used to be part of Yugoslavia, and Albania.) If you plan to spend a lot of time in Croatia and or Slovenia, LP's individual country guides for these too countries offer far more depth and detail. For the other countries (Serbia and Montenegro, Macedonia, Bosnia and Albania) you're probably better off with the Bradt guides. (Or buy both.) LP only touches on a handful of major cities in each country. Given the low page count, the writers/editors could have easily expanded the coverage by just expanding the book!"
3,Better than no guidebook at all,"I chose this guidebook because I was still unsure about where I wanted to go in the area. As has been said before, the chapter on Slovenia is great. I found the chapter and maps on Serbia and Montenegro to not be very helpful. The maps would be much more useful if they had street names in both Roman and Cyrillic alphabets (where applicable)."
3,"Average, but LP usually does better","This is a Lonely Planet first edition,and it shows. I used this book on an expedition through Slovenia and Croatia; while I cannot comment on the other sections, these two sections need a bit of work. Slovenia has introduced the Euro since this book was published, yet all the Slovenia prices are listed in its native currency. That rendered the pricing guide as useless. The section on Croatia could easily use another 100 pages; current descriptions feel short and very brief. In short, this travel guide could use another 100 or 200 pages easily. As it stands now, it is an adequate travel guide, and Lonely Planet will probably fix thses minor annoyances in its second edition."
1,WHo's controlling the inventory?,"This book is apparently hard to get. I received my copy of this amazing book of photography, ostensibly new, and while paging through it noticed that one photograph in the middle had been carefully cut out. It did not appear to be the work of the publisher. I have ordered a replacement copy, which appears to be hard to get. Quality control, people!"
5,Exactly What I Needed,"Got this for my Fluval 405; fits perfectly. The YouTube video for installing was helpful. But clear instructions are not possible for this product as there are multiple installation possibilities. My setup, for example, is a bit atypical:Used both spray bars and the extension connector. In my 36"" wide tank this was a glove-like fit, leaving just enough room for the filter's intake. This left only one part unused: the smaller elbow. Still not sure what it was 'suppose' to be used for. *heh*My goal was to reduce surface disturbance and distribute the power of the filter's output. So I faced the spray bar toward the wall and slightly down. Now the floating plants are no longer being shoved around by the filter output. Still gas exchange is important. So a more gentle surface agitation is provided via air pump."
4,Very good product however...,It works great but the only problem is the installation. There's no direction to this so you kind of have to wing it also comes with 2 extra pieces which threw me off a bit other than that once its installed its great!
2,No Instructions,Be nice to have directions on how to install. I will have to spend some time looking around for information on how to use. I feel i paid for a product that was incomplete. I expected better service than this = FAIL
3,OK,Installed in my 75 gallon tank with my fluval 406. I used both spray bars and connected them together with the rubber boot. The two plastic elbows are to keep the output hose from kinking when connecting the spray bar. The plastic elbows keep it a 90 degree angle if need be i didn't use it through. The bigger of the two works on the 305/405/406 series and the smaller is for the 205 and below i believe. I wish it came with a way to hook it up on the top lip of the tank for us who have 3d backgrounds. I just wedged the suction cups in between the two parts of my background to hold it. I will make a trip to the hardware store and get some elbows and straights and will probably just end up making my own.
4,Rockbag,"The bag itself is fine; it is practically layed out and has ample space for everything. I was disappointed with the cart though. When it arrived and I began to assemble it the black metal tube structures were showing signs of rust to the point that the paint was flaking off. In addition, after only three usages, one of the plastic wheels broke apart causing the wheel to come off. I am looking to upgrade the wheels to metal hubs to prevent future problems."
1,junk,"I purchased this lantern and it worked the first time. The 2nd time, we had a power outage and I went to turn it on. Nothing happened. I changed the batteries. Still nothing. I tried to find out how I could return it. I called and emailed several times with no response. After about 6 weeks, I tried again and a real person answered. I would have to pay almost $9.00 to mailed it back. It's not worth the postage."
1,Leaves you in the dark,"My wife always buys high tech looking bad equipment. This was to go with the tent she bought for her New Zealand relatives to camp out in the grand canyon. I dug it out, a few years later... No batteries, which is good when stored. Kicked it around for 4 or 5 months wondering when I would locate suitable batteries without wasting a trip to the store... Found bats, have lantern -load batteries (accordingly) and Wa-laa... NOTHING!!! Reload... Nothing, nothing, nothing. Worthless junk, tossed it in garbage. Use once and toss... If I could give it no stars I would. If I questioned why I'd take this time to review, I wouldn't. It's obviously a bad product not worth mention to begin with. Lesson learned? Help wife who goes camping before I going sailing. It's cheap because it is. Buy the better cheaper but not this one because it is worthless."
1,Very Poor Light Output,"I really wanted to like this lantern. It is a nice size and is nicely made at a great price, but the light output is pathetic. The package gives the impression that there are 4 leds in it, but I find that doubtful. The light output is no better than the output from a tiny key fob Princeton Tec or Photon. In fact, I think you could read a map, or a book, play cards, or follow a trail, more easily with one of the tiny key fob lights. I'm returning mine."
1,"Looks great, poor output","Like other users, I found the light output substandard. I bought it specifically as an emergency light source. If I really needed this light, there really would be an emergency! Absolutely pathetic."
4,Focused and clear,"I just began treatments with the author of this book last week and she told me to read the book. As I have read many, many books on Candida, I was not looking forward to rehashing the material. However, I was surprised at the readability of the book(even with small print!), the clarity of her explanations, and her ability to stay focused on the topics presented in each chapter. I feel like it is the best organized Candida book I have read and has the clearest language for non-medical customers. Other books have made me feel like they were a little bit ""out there"" and too alternative to share with friends. I intend to order this book for at least 4 people: I have no problem in recommending it. I will try to remember to come back and report on my outcome with this treatment in 3-6 months."
2,Nothing new,"The information presented in the book is readily available online for free, this book does not bring anything new to the table. I found even a 1986 edition of 'The Yeast Connection' by Dr. William Crook to be more interesting and comprehensive."
5,Great conversation piece!,"This book is AMAZING! It always catches the eye of my guests as I leave it on my coffee table. It's an amazing conversation piece and icebreaker for those awkward silences! In addition, I sleep soundly at night now that I have the tools to conquer those yeast infections!"
5,A Marvelous Read,"I absolutely loved reading this book. The author has the right combination of historical data and character development to keep the reader engaged in the story thoroughout its course. I wished in the end that Harold could have a different ending. Ms. Hollick is that good in her character development. Dorothy Dunnett did that for Macbeth in King Hereafter and Elizabeth Chadwick did that for Walteof in The Winter Mantle, all based on real people who came to tragic ends. Kudos to Ms. Hollick. I'll be looking at other books by this author."
1,"Nothing New Here, Minimal Substantive Content","A small book of only 116 pages, 43 of them blank, memo, or title pages! The balance which is substantive is referenced material from other low-carbohydrate diet texts. Nothing new here!"
5,Best Ever,"I have bought a lot of books on losing weight, this is so simple but yet so true. My doctor told me to do a low carb way of eating and I had heard of this book, I ordered it and received it today. I couldn't put it down."
5,ONE OF THE BEST ART FILMS I HAVE EVEN SEEN,"JENNIFER RUBIN AND KYLE SECOR ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER. EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE THE BAD GUYS, YOU CAN'T HELP BUT LIKE THEM. SECOR PLAYED HIS PART WITH PERFECTION."
1,Prints used to create this DVD were poor quality and it shows.,"I normally don't notice flaws in the prints used for DVD transfers, but in the case of this DVD, the flaws really stand out. This makes it difficult to enjoy the shows. I own a 26 inch Sharp TV, which is by no means any kind of high end TV. However, even with this TV I can see dirt, water spots, and scratches on every episode from the first season. I haven't watched the rest so I'm not sure of the quality for the remaining seasons, but I suspect it will be the same. You can clearly see dirt and water spots on the prints, especially on the faces of each character, due to the color used for their skin. I loved this show when I was a kid, and am disappointed in the poor quality of the prints that were used to create the DVDS. I am also surprised that the studio's quality control department allowed the product to ship like this; it would appear that their motto was profit over quality."
1,No Blu-Ray?,"Ok, I am not spending money on this DVD Set because there must be a Blu-Ray version of this right around the corner which they are not telling us about.My wife and I love the Flintstones but, we are both disappointed the Blu-Ray version did not come out the same time as the regular DVD version did.We are saving our money on this one and will wait for the Blu-Ray version.Oh, the Flintstones get 5 Stars. 1 Star is for the DVD version."
4,the flintstones; THE COMPLETE SERIES,the flintstones;the complete series is a must have for those who love classic cartoons or for those who have small children and want to show them what 'real cartoons' are. i highly recommend this series. the only problem is that the discs are hard to get out of the cardboard sleeves that make up the 'book' that they are packed in. seems like the discs will scratch easily. for that reason i give the flintstones a 4.
3,Okay set but has it's flaws,"Just received the set and it's okay being the whole series is here but it's no different from the original 6 sets. I would have liked it better if they included maybe a book or something besides the disks like the Batman Animated series box set does.It mentions 4.5 hours of extras leading me to believe they added more extras but that's not the case. The extras are the same as in the individual sets.Packaging comes in 2 booklets made of cheap cardboard with very tight sleeves to insert the disks. This can and will cause some scratches on the disk being it's tight. About half my discs do have visible scratches on them. The booklets are nice with just the episode titles of each disc listed on them.I hate the ugly orange case so i got rid of it and kept the 2 booklets.So i give a 3 star rating for the content, and minus 2 stars for lack of anything extra from the original sets."
4,Nice Complete Series DVD Box Set,"I like most everything about this complete series box set except the cardboard sleeves that hold the DVDs. The picture and sound quality is excellent considering this cartoon is almost 50 years old. It doesn't appear any remastering has been done. I have seen shows that remastering actually made the picture quality worse. If you are a fan of The Flinstones you will not regret buying this entire series set.Because of the cardboard sleeves, I give this set 4 Stars."
2,What a dumb idea,I saw this set advertised and thought wow all the Flintstones in 1 box. Now that I have it I am very disappointed on how the dvds are stored. They are put in cardboard sleeves and if you take them out even once you will put scratches on them and I find this unacceptable.jeff
4,"Great content, cheap packaging.","I bought this item as a gift for my Aunt who is into nostalgic tv shows. The dvds get a lot of use. Unfortunately, the collection comes in 2 cardboard like books that are not very durable. In each book there seems to be one dvd that doesn't have a color label. They still play in our old dvd player, but its difficult to read the tiny print on the inner circle of the dvd. In addition to the cheap dvd sleeves, the decal on the front of the orange exterior box has started to curl up on the top and bottom. Its nothing more than a thick sticker. The dvds themselves play with great quality and sound. Despite the packaging, this is still a great item to add to your collection."
3,Good Overall But...,"Good overall but the case is cheap and I would not use the paper sleeves once you remove the disc once, the discs can and will get scratched."
3,The Flintstones complete series,"The Flintstones complete series has to be the worst dvd set for how they pack their dvds, they put them in a cardboard booklet , and their really tight in it, if u pulled it out u would scratch it , meh , i cut them out and a few of them had scratches , one of them i had to go spend 3 dollars to get it cleaned , cause it had a big mark on it and would not play, i was lucky to get that mark off"
2,echo of their own voice reported by other party,"i'm the returning unit now due to folks who were on the other end of the call complaining of hearing echoes of their own voices ... i tried adjusting the speakerphone volume level ... helped but they still said it was annoying ... similar problem whether calling landline, VoIP phones and cells ;-( ... experience for me was generally pretty good though similar to another feedback when one other end party put me on their (Treo) speakerphone it was [not suprisingly] terrible ... sound v choppy;-("
1,Star Waste,"Sorry, didn't like. Costumes hideous, punch-outs don't correspond with the drawings, thick white lines around the costumes,tabs aren't all in the right places to hang correctly on the doll and one outfit shows a third foot protruding. I can't believe this was supervised by George Lucas! Poor quality but it is cheap so it gets one star."
4,Asuka & Rei Military figures,"The pair show came as a set, each figure in its own box. Each figure came with about 5 weapons each (either figure can hold an one of them at a time).The downside with the figures is that only the wrists of their gunhands move. Both figures heads can also move from side to side, but Asuka (the redhead) is very very limited in motion due to her hair. Also, due to the small cicular stands that attach to the figures' feet, I recommend placing them on a surface that is stable, as I've had both of them fall off my drafting table when I bumped it (one such fall snapped the peg off of Rei's stand while it was still in her foot. This was fixed with a dab of super glue, however.)The figures are great for an artist looking for a good standing pose to referrence. Their clothes and accessories are very detailed."
4,Fast Acting...,"I would present a video review, but I fear that would do more harm than good, so I'll say this:- it worked within 10 minutes- the crystal itself was very easy to insert- the overall process was about as comfortable as one could ask(considering that it involves inserting stuff into parts unknown).""Feed Me More"" - Ryback"
5,"Statistics in Plain English, Second Edition- Timothy C. Urdan","Great book! :- it answers not only what & how of statistics issues but also why, describing all the possibilities, covering all the possible questions one might pose with a step by step concepts interconnection. It puts technicalities and mathematical operations behind concepts. As a result, user is able to recognize a situation and apply the right tecnique.- for non native English speakers it uses a very clear language. No slang nor ambiguous words.- also, best book I ever found to teach the fundamentals of statistics."
2,Worthless packaging,"I ordered two sets of these dominoes for family members, and both sets arrived damaged. The dominoes themselves were fine, but the vinyl cases were ripped at the seams on both sets. They were obviously packaged that way because the shrink wrap on the outside and the paper label between the shrink wrap and the vinyl case were both fine. We kept the dominoes but had to buy new storage boxes for both sets."
5,good times,Great book!! Nice to hear from Steadman. I'm almost 50 and have been a fan of Ralph's and the good doctor since I'm 13. Painfull at times to read laugh out loud funny at otherrs. Thanks Mr. Steadman for showing me this side of HST and yourself. Jo Sullivan
3,HST was right: Ralph should stick to drawing,"The book should be commended as it offers some great insight into the, at times, testy relationship between Ralph and Hunter through the years. What I found disappointing is that Ralph's used this book as his latest medium to again whine on about the fact Hunter did not invite him on either of the vegas trips that were the basis for the infamous Fear and Loathing novel. At times, Ralph's continued bitterness is quite appearent and to me just comes off as very unflattering. In Hunter's life, there were many stories and trips that Ralph was not a included. Hunter had many friends and traveling companions like Michael Solheim (a.k.a. Yail Bloor), who accompanied the good doctor on drug and booze filled coverage of fishing tournament in Cozumel. I think a casual gonzo reader may find the book more enjoyable than those who are more avid and longtime fans."
4,Ralph's Take on Hunter,"There are passages in this volume which will cause your heart to weep. Steadman is no slouch with the written word. His recounting of the Kentucky Derby episode had me LOL. When he does address the dark side of his departed friend, you feel as though there's no axe to grind, merely an attempt to set the record straight.If you've been drawn to HST's work over the years, then this effort by Steadman should take its rightful place on the bookshelf next to Thompson's works. Part memoir, part elegy, it gives another insight into the ""bad craziness"" that made Hunter S. Thompson tick."
4,"Quick Read, Great Intro to Shadowrun","I haven't read any previous Shadowrun novels so I am not biased by that. I have played the game some and read some of the sourcebooks. Born to Run starts off a whole new series with a new cast of characters. The writing is not difficult to read, and the action is fast paced. You get to know some of the shadowrunners in Seattle, and follow the career of a new runner named Kellan Colt. Because the story plays out from Kellan's perspective most of the time, you learn the world of shadowrunning along with her. I consider this book to be light reading, and it won't win any literary awards, but it was a really fun read and I enjoyed it immensely. I recommend it for anyone new to the world of Shadowrun or even to more seasoned Shadowrun fans who want to go back to their roots."
3,Great for shadowrun noobs,"This book is great for people who dont know much about shadowrun, The book is following the career of a new runner Kellen Colt just after arriving in Seattle. The story tells about what a runner has through go through to start to make a name for her/him self in the sprawls. The book is well written and easy to read. This is my complaint though.Shadowrun just released its 4th edition rule set which sets the world in 2070. New technology has completely rechanged the world. Im curious why the writers didnt start the new books in the 2070 area. We all know what's been going on but I need reference material for the 70s Im hoping the new books catch us up to the new time line."
2,Amateur reading material,"While following the life and times of an up and coming runner can be made into an interesting story, this book is not one of them.The book follows along an acceptable storyline, however it feels like it was written for teenagers, or perhaps pre-teens as it was overly simple to read and felt like someone's first novel...ever. I would not recommend this book to anyone with a high school reading level as it will bore you to death. Could be decent for those interested in some fast paced action and bathroom material but other than it doesn't hold much promise."
4,Shadowrun Duels advertisement,"Just about all the characters in the book are part of the Wizards action figure Duels series game. This book is for new fans of shadowrun, all the older readers of shadowrun novels might find it a tad on the boring side.Having all the characters be of Duels origins, make this novel feel more like a novel advertisement than new material for the Shadowrun world.If your jonesing for some new Shadowrun material though, the book is a decent hold over until the next novel."
5,Perfectly good!I,"I found that the product lived up too it's claimed expectations and works perfectly as suggested. It arrived promptly and was easy to assemble. My seventy pound Standard Poodle was comfortable while it was stationary however, after we began to ride he becsme more trepidatious the next time I tried to coax him in while it was attatched to the bike. I also realized as anticipated that you can definitley feel the load when you get to a hill and the momentumn changes dramaticaly. All in all, I would say that it is a good product that you can use with your bike to haul your dog, groceries ...etc and to go green on your bike at at a very reasonable price."
5,Two paws up!!,"Absolutely love the trailer. Easy to put together, very sturdy. Folds up nicely for storage or traveling. I don't think I could have been any happier when I got it! We got an extra hitch so we can switch the trailer from one bike to another. Great purchase."
4,Breeces' wheels,We received this bike trailer yesterday and we were very impressed with how easy it is to set up. I bought the kit to convert it so we can push our dog in it. We have a 75 lb golden retriever who has osteosarcoma (bone cancer)in her front leg and is not able to walk for any great distance so this wasjust what we needed to take her for those long walks she has always loved.The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the bottom of this trailer is not very stable/sturdy. When she got in it she got very scared because of how warbly it was. My husband will put some kind of board underneath it to stabilize that for her and hopefully this will ease her fear. Other than that we really like it and look forward to many miles of walking with her in it.
1,Cheap - very disappointed,"This is a huge disappointment - the design was a good idea but the manufacturing looks like it was made by an unskilled kid in sewing class. The fabric, zippers and stiching are cheap and didn't fit properly around the frame. The material was baggy in spots and so tight it was ripping at the seams in other spots. One of the tires was defective and didn't hold any air. The final straw was that it made too much noise when I tried to jog with it. The bike hitch hangs below and rattles the entire time. After reading other reveiws - I have decided to return it and not ask for a replacement."
4,"fun and sturdy, but needs a bit of space!","I bought this to bike around New York City with my 10-year-old Lab, because he's too arthritic to come on long runs anymore. The axel hitch and cabin construction were easy and intuitive to set up, and the nylon/vinyl is durable. It's also plenty roomy; all 5'1"" and 115 pounds of me fit in it easily. I toss a slice of bacon inside to bribe my canine pal, and we're off.The only caution I'd give is: measure before you buy! The wheels widen the frame considerably, so I have to remove them (an easy pop-and-click mechanism) to get in or out of my apartment and elevator doors. Obviously if you live in suburbia with a garage, this is no problem, but if you're a fellow big-city dweller, it might take a little twiddling on the sidewalk before you're off and biking. It's also a bit heavy to carry without the wheels and doesn't fold down too small, but overall I'm very glad I bought it."
3,Not for every dog,"Cushion wasn't as soft as I expected. If you expose a puppy to the trailer it would be fine, but my dog was digging his way out."
3,great design but poorly constructed,"If only the manufacturer realized they could sell this at a higher price point, it would not have been so cheaply made. This trailer will last me the summer but I will have to purchase another before next year. The design is great--all the features as described are awesome. Unfortunately, one of the wheel's spokes had to be tightened right out of the box, the blue fabric color faded within one week, the rear access zipper broke at week three and the tires are nearly bald after two months. I use for 4-5 trips a week to ride my older 85 lb lab to work (about a 1.5 mile ride each way), while my younger 90 lb lab runs along side. I would gladly have paid more for this trailer if it were manufactured to last a few years."
4,Pulls easy,"I purchased this specifically for a trip I was making to Mackinac Island. The unit functioned perfectly, it pulls easy, and got a lot of looks from other bikers. On a trial run my dog, a 65lb border collie, decided to stand up while I was making a turn. The trailer went over on its side and the nylon wore away rather quickly along one frame member. I was a bit concerned about stability because of this, but the dog learned to lie down when in the trailer and we've had no other incidents."
5,A-MAZ-ING!!!,"I was completely blown away by the plethora of colors, the crisp video transfers, and the rush of each individual racing scene!!! This title is an absolute must-have for any Blu-Ray enthusiast looking to showcase the capability of their home theatre set-up. If you're on the fence, don't hesitate, just buy it! You won't be disappointed!!!"
3,"Speed Racer, take it out of 2nd gear","Well this is an enjoyable family movie but not particularly anything to cheer about. To some degree it seems to follow the orginal cartoons, and it reminded me of how the Flintstones were converted to a live movie. In fact we have Fred himself playing Speeds' father. Reasonably good effects and decent acting make it worth a look. I kind of liked it but felt something was missing. Everyone should get a kick out of the other drivers and some of the stunts used to take each other out. I suggest this as a rental first until you know if it is something you truly want to buy. Good quality DVD with some replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Spy Kids"" and ""Cars"".CA Luster"
1,"Whoa, Speed Racer!","A big mistake from the Wachowski Brothers. Fans of the Japanese animated series will scratch their heads over this garish big-screen disaster. In theory, most live-action cartoon adaptations represent a ludicrous waste of film. ""Speed Racer"" is no exception. The 135-minute running time becomes a cinematic endurance test."
5,Amazing,"Without a doubt, this film is better on Blu-Ray. But nevertheless, this film was everything that was missing in modern action films, most importantly - the emphasis on family. People have complained about the bright colors and fast paced races... this isn't NASCAR, it's Speed Racer!Don't listen to the critics, none of whom compared it to the original cartoon (probably because they had no appreciation for it's significance in animation history). I personally rank this up with Citizen Kane and the Temptress as one of the greatest films ever made. In 10 years, I promise you elements of this film are going to make their way slowly into more and more movies."
3,Sparkle Motion,"The important thing to remember about Speed Racer, is that it reveals the true meaning behind going to see a movie. Previously, I thought that the true beauty of a movie lay in the acting, writing, and directing. But now I realize that things like plot structure, set design, acting choices, are all just a vehicle to bring to audiences the Sparkly Light.I watched this a few months ago. I don't remember much of what happened in the movie, except that it was entertaining enough. But my head is still reeling from having witnessed THE SPARKLE."
3,"AMAZING technical wizardry, but - Speed Racer?","Ok, this is probably one of the most amazing technical movies I've ever seen - very well acted, especially by Susan Sarandon as Mom Racer, who was just amazing in this, but - Speed Racer??My 2 cents.If you're really really into speed racer the cartoon, you must have this.if you really liked the middle and last matrix movie, you'll probably like this. probably not enough to make it worth buying tho :(.If you're into the technical feats of making cutting edge movies, get this and watch the extra stuff.Beyond that? um - yeah, rent it maybe? (which is what I did).Still and all - it's a really mazing movie, technically - just amazing feats of digital movie making, and it's several steps beyond bullettime from the first matrix movie :). (I KNOW Kung FU! ;) )"
5,Go Speed!,"After having grown up on the classic cartoon (mainly due to my older brothers) I was very surprised to find that I liked this move immensely. It's not Lawrence of Arabia, to be sure, but it really has the spirit of Speed Racer and the visuals to match. Visually, this movie will knock you on your duff in no time flat. I just wish a re-release would tender a Dolby TrueHD audio track. Even with the Dolby Digital mix that is used, though, you might not even notice. Definitely a worthy flick if you are a fan of the old series!"
1,Horrible movie!,Only watched about 25 minutes and had to turn it off. I was a big Speed Racer fan growing up. Big dissapointment!
1,Dont get what you pay for,I purchased the speed racer movie only to find out that the digital download had expired the day before. I could not reach anyone at warner brothers so I sent it back.Do not buy any Warner brother movies unless you find out when the downloads expire!
2,why did they bother?,"Really, why bother to make a movie in the odd manner in which someone had the harebrained concept as to make this one? This movie had to have been produced almost entirely in front of a blue screen. There is practically nothing real. It is almost as if the joke is on the viewer who possibly expected to see an actual movie. It is that bad. An as for Susan Sarandon, John Goodman, and Christina Ricci, you can almost see the look on their faces that A. No one they know ever sees this dog, and B. The paycheck doesn't bounce. Frankly, if you like the old Speed Racer cartoon, then watch it, not this. The only reason I gave two stars is for the learning experience. I learned just how badly botched even a simple old cartoon like Speed Racer could turn out modernized in film length. Blech."
1,Blu-Ray = BAD RAY from Warner Bros.,"Warner Bros would like you to think you are getting a great DVD set of SPEED RACER, all you get is the movie on a 25GB disc with NO that is RIGHT NO HD Lossless Audio TRACK! All you get is standard DD 5.1 track... how old right esp for an eye and ear candy film. Even the recent release of the classic Eastwood films from WB's (the Gauntlet, Every Which Way But) Loose Got LOSSLESS HD audio!The second disc is a digital copy of the film which I feel digital copies are a waste myself. I could care less.The Third disc is a sort of game based on the film and you can imagine how bad and useless this will be!SO in short you are paying a lot for actually not even a Special Edition and you get not so great audio."
1,Not Compatible with Mac or iPods,"I love this movie, think it's the most unappreciated film of last year and one of my favorites. The Blu-ray is excellent, this is a film that's made for High-Def. This is a reference disk you show HD newbs, who'll take one look and say ""I get it now. The picture and audio are stunning."" The colors really pop on my Sony Bravia, the audio is amazing, good extra features. This 3 disk version gets 1 star because the Digital Copy isn't compatible with Macs or iPods. It's the first Blu-ray that I've encountered that does this and I specifically purchased this 3 Disc version for the Digital Copy. I travel a lot and like having that ability to watch on the plane and in my hotel."
3,"Two boys' review: The racing is jaw-dropping, the rest is yawn-inducing","I have two sons, ages 6 and 4, who love to play Mario Kart on the Nintendo DS. They loved the racing scenese in this movie but the dramatic scenes between each race bored them silly.This is a movie aimed at young boys, but perhaps ages 8-10 is the right target. There's just too much soap opera drama stretching this story past the hour and a half mark for younger kids. However, the dazzling special effects are something you don't want to miss."
4,Psychedelic fun for the whole family.,"Based on the animated TV series, Speed Racer may start out slow, but it soon becomes engrossing. Race car driver Speed Racer (Emilie Hirsch) loves driving - it's in his blood (and it's the family business). When he makes it to the big leagues, Speed learns about the dark side of the sport that took the life of his older brother.Costarring Christina Ricci, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, and Matthew Fox, Speed Racer is psychedelic fun for the whole family."
4,Video quality great. Audio quality is not much different from DVD,I won't review the movie but instead focus on blu-ray qualityThe good: The video quality is vibrant and looks great on Blu-ray. Extras are okay.The bad: The audio quality could have been so much more. It's a a standard Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track that never really wows like the video.Overall: It's not bad for the right price (bought it used + shipping for under $10)Tested on 110' screen with Viewsonic 1080p projector and 7.1 surround set-up
1,not worth your hard earned cash,"What a disappointment. Like Alice in wonderland meets Mario Andretti. Bad acting,flashing lights and colors. I'm sorry I spent that much and geeting so little in return. Both young and old in our home agreed."
1,kids today must be geniuses,"Because this is the most confusing movie I've ever seen. I was able to discern who the good guys and the bad guys were, but beyond that, I couldn't tell what was going on throughout the movie. Where are they? WHEN are they? Who's that? Why do they care about that? Why are they trying to kill him?But perhaps this whole thing was brilliance on the director's part, successfully mimicking the sensation of spinning out of control and smacking a wall?"
3,Warner Bros. Obviously Aren't Mac Fans; Glorious in HD,"No where on this page does is say that the second disc is a pretty boring DVD game. Nowhere else on here does it say the digital copy disc is only compatible with PCs.Luckily, the actual Blu-Ray disc IS multi-regional. I live here in Australia and the disc works fine, just finished watching it. It's a beautiful film in high-definition and completely mind-boggling.I'm not going to bore you with what I think the film is about or is like, but the Blu-Ray is a bit of a bummer. 3 stars for the whole shebang, but I rate the film four stars."
3,To childish,This movie is good for you if you are under 12 years old or if you are too nostalgic about the series.
3,Unneccesary violence...,"Good but unacceptable, unneccesary violence.... why do family movie makers keep screwing stuff up for kids? Just hint at the idea of a bad guy in a way that won't give us nightmares.. we'll all get it. I promise. So sad they turn great movies into SAW garbage nowadays...."
4,BD review of speedracer,It's a rather hokey movie but still manages to make you care about the characters and the final race (I'd give the movie alone 3 stars). The BD copy is crazy sharp and the colors of speed racer really stick out on the BD (video 5 stars). The sound was good but not exceptional and I agree with others that there should have been a lossless audio option (sound 3.5 stars). rounding it all together I give it an overall 4 star rating. For $10 it's a good addition to any BD collection to get a very unique picture and overall good BD experience.
5,A Fun and Colorful Movie,"I loved this movie. The action parts reminded me of the old Bat Man movies. The movie is filled with great actors. No boring parts, a great plot. The movie is about 2 hours long but it really doesn't seem like it when watching it. It's a fun movie for kids and adults. I really enjoyed it and think you would too. Ciao"

5,GET IT NOW!,I loved it! its fun to watch and gives me a title I can enjoy with my kids with something that I grew up with. Just like the old carton but made more modern.
5,Great movie! A hell of an adrenaline rush!,"Personally, I did not think of much when I went to see this movie in the theaters. Afterwards I left refreshed because this movie rocked me out of my seat. It was amazing. I was impressed with the Matrix films also made by the Wachowski Brothers and I figured they were going to do another groundbreaking film. I was deeply surprised that this movie didn't do better at the boxoffice. Well it was up against Iron Man and Indiana Jones technically. I did enjoy the anime in the past and the movie is like the anime. If you have seen the anime you know it will have cheesy moments and the race sequences will keep you on the edge of your seat. Overall, fantastic movie and can't wait for it to come out on DVD so I can race to the store and snag it ASAP!"
5,One of My Favorite Movies This Year,"The Wachowski Brothers do it again with ground breaking special effects and unique story telling. I really enjoyed this movie and don't understand why it wasn't a bigger box office hit. Elements of action, drama, love-story, racing, fairy tale, kung-fu, cartoon, and fantasy all rolled into one slick and entertaining production."
2,"No plot, but great graphics","This movie put me to sleep, literally. My kids were confused by the back-and-forth beginning.However, the graphics were excellent, and it should shine on HD."
2,DVD Review ONLY,"This review is for the DVD packaging. I received my copy of Speed Racer DVD only to find the disc scratched (yes, it was still on the spindle). So I ordered and recieved a replacement, and it was scratched in exactly the same manner. Perhaps a manufacturing defect?"
5,Speed Racer (Widescreen Edition),Great Movie! Lots of action and color. Looks awesome in HD! Great story and sticks very true to the original cartoon. This is a great family movie! Definately Recommend!
4,Speed Racer DVD Review,This was a gift for my son-in-law and he has been very pleased with this DVD. Works great and I was pleased with the price and the delivery time.
3,"A flashy,enjoyable family movie","I enjoyed this movie very much, the effects and action scenes were amazing and I think the wachowski's did an amazing job with the source material. The story was a bit cliched and shallow, but hey, the cartoon wasnt known for having deep and thoughtprovoking storylines. It is what it is, if your a fan of speed racer or of action filled family flicks, you'll thouroughly enjoy it, just dont expect a pixar film, lol."
4,Doesn't come with a book :(,"Great movie, dvd case comes with a cardbord case, but it doesn't come with the little book inside. why is this happening. I dont think that the real reason was the saving of paper."
3,Mixing of media,"Movies whose imagery are clearly the combination of live-action with animation are rare, with maybe one major release every year. Cool World and Who Framed Roger Rabbit are two examples. For 2009, Speed Racer was the only live-action animated combo movie, and did not do that well at the theaters. The movie tries to combine several themes, and tries to come of as a serious movie. There is the overall racing theme of the movie, which of course drives the special effects. Then there is the requisite romance between Speed Racer (yes the movie is named after the title character) and his girlfriend. There is also the tense relationship between Speed Racer and his fellow racers in the final cross-country marathon. And like any good sports movie, we have the corrupt businessmen who try and fix the sport for profit. All told, an alright movie. At times the animation gets in the way of the storyline with the bright colors. But still entertaining."
4,Loved the movie! Sad no sequel in the mix,"This movie unfortunately did not get the box office draw it was hoping and failed miserably. My family and I though absolutely love it. The Blu-Ray looks amazing with all the vivid colors and speedy scenes that take place in the movie. The movie itself is a great kids movie as well as having some adult humor. Overall though the race scenes, especially in Blu-Ray, do not fail to impress and if your a fan of the old school Speed Racer cartoons you'll like what the directors did to bring that world to life."
4,"5 stars for the movie, 1 star removed for the packaging ...","This is a marvellous movie. The level of imagination, work and style is breathtaking and as a jaded 44 year old I deeply loved it.However: where's the HD audio, where's the serious extras (if any movie deserves a production analysis documentary then this one does - there IS one on the disc but it's flimsy) and WHY IS MY BOX BROKEN?!The last question is a real bone of contention. Some multi disc Blu-Ray releases are packaged in a standard sized box with a moving section inside to accommodate the extra discs. I've got three of these boxes (Firefly, Speed Racer, When we left the Planet) and two have been broken on arrival. The plastic used is totally inadequate for the hinge mechanism required to move the disc flap and also it will not accept super-glue. It's astonishingly poor quality design and materials and I can guarantee I'm not the only person with broken boxes. Please stop using this design you manufacturing types!"
5,kids love it!!,"we saw this at the theater, but they were still excited to get it on dvd. there's plenty of action and cool cars, along with a little plot twist. this movie looks like it will be hit with these guys for a long time to come."
4,True to the Spirit of the Original,"I grew up watching Speed Racer after school. I was not sure what to expect from this movie, but all I can say is that it gave me goosebumps at times - especially the subtle music cues. Sure it's a bit cartoonish - but that's the point. My only problem with the movie is that for some silly reason, they decided to have Spritle 'flip the bird' which doesn't fit with the overall tone of the movie - otherwise I would be showing this to my kids right now."
3,"The ""Great Criticise Race""","When I was a kid, I'd run home from school to catch Speed Racer. As for the movie, I'll admit that I had epileptic fears watching all those color flashes (and I don't even have epilepsy), but the Wachowski brothers have made a masterpiece of a family film.Come on folks; it's based on a manga, turned TV series then translated into a campy, 1967 cartoon, but it is also one of the early pioneers of America's intro to Japanese anime. I think it's fair to say that too often with ""children's"" films, critics are quick to dismantle, dismiss and disrespect the surface of what they see and hear and in doing so, completely overlook the depth of what's really being said.Speed Racer may not go down on black and white as an award winner or blockbuster, mega hit; but it's what's under the hood that counts.. morals with heart. The way things are going lately, we could all do with some extra morals and there ain't NOTHING wrong with that."
1,Visually blinding and kinda stupid,"Throughout the whole film the bright, flashy colors made me fear that I would have a seizure or something! The film is kinda slow at first and there is a lot of unnecesary dialogue. Kids will probably leave during those long sequences of talking and hopefully come back during the rare moments of action. I give it a 1 star because it was painful to watch and the only thing that was really entertaining to me was the hot guy who played Speed(also who names their kid Speed?)"
1,Worst movie of the year!,"I only saw Speed Racer for 2 reasons: (1) I grew up watching the cartoon, & (2) It was done by the Wachowski's. Speed Racer is horrible! The biggest pile of **** I've seen since Spider-man 3. The 1st thing I wanted to do when I left the theatre was gouge my eyes out. Do you have to be on drugs to see this thing? No wonder John Goodman went into rehab after making this! I just hope the Wachowski's next project, Ninja Assassin, is better. Does the DVD come with eye drops?"
1,"Piece of trash movie, totally pathetic","Could not sit through this movie, found it an insult to my intelligence. Acting seemed stilted and fake from the beginning. Seemed superficial and aggravatingly ugly movie. I think I'll stick to watching the old movies for a while."
1,Blame it on superhero hype.com,"That web-site said what a cool movie this would be. Who are they kidding?This live action take on the cartoon was very stupid. No script, no acting. and no point to it at all. Better off buying a video game."
3,Speed Racer by Brandon M. Moskos,"I was pretty disappointed in this film. I thought it would've been a lot better. I bought it because Emile Hirsch is one of my favorite actors, (See ""Into the Wild"" if you haven't seen it yet!) I found the movie to be quite boring and I really found it difficult to watch the whole thing. The acting was average and so was the story. I give it a C. I think younger people under 15 would enjoy this movie more than older people. Quite disappointing."
4,Not as much nudity and sleaze as some of Gemser's other films,"I think this film may disappoint some people. Although the nudity isn't nonstop, there's some good nude scenes in the film; but it doesn't have as much nudity and sleaze as some as Gemser's other films. There's a couple of sleazy nude scenes involving Gemser and a crazy photographer, one of which is a sleazy rape scene. However, most of the nude scenes are more classy than most of the stuff with Gemser and Joe D' Amato; most of it isn't that gratuitous. The film has a couple elements of horror thrown in. In one scene Gemser is forced to pose near some dead bodies, and a baby goat is sacrificed near the end of the film; and the film benefits from its Egyptian locations that provide great scenery. I also thought it's well scored and directed.The DVD quality looks great."
2,Average,"This movie is your average Black Emanuelle outing. I bought it because it has my two favorite soft core (run around naked) actresses. It doesn't go quite as far as Emanuelle In America, but it's better than others. The transition to DVD isn't bad, and it's not as hard to come by as it used to be. I only recommend it if you're addicted to these two girls."
2,Wexler does not get Emma,"For the real Emma Goldman and for a far better understanding getyourself copies ofEmma Goldman Living My Life Volume 1Emma Goldman Living My Life Volume 2These two volumes amount to nothing less than the single finest, single most relevant and unmatched autobiography in the entire history of English language autobiography."
1,Hands off!,"This review is not about the music, it is just about the physical product. Beware, for this edition is not a factory-pressed CD but a cheaply made CD-R with a photocopied ""booklet"". The reason why any serious music collector - and who elese would purchase a CD edition of a non-mainstream 1980s heavy metal record - would want such crap is beyond me. I could just as well download the songs in mp3 format and print out the cover from one of the numerous scans floating around the web. The business model of selling CD-Rs just does not make a lot of sense nowadays, actually it would never have made any sense. Do yourself a favor and find the original vinyl or CD on ebay or discogs."
4,Very Entertaining,I thought this book was mostly great. I enjoy learning about past histories of countries and I found the story line as well as the facts of the country entertaining. I found myself wanting to read more because I started to feel sympathy for the characters in the book. The only thing that bothered me a little about the book was how the writing went from present to past time but when it all leveled out and was in present then it didn't bother me.
4,"This Book That Make Me Happy, And Stuff Like That !",Now this book like to make me happy cuse this book I read at myschool bus when I got home I was like can you pless give me thisbook so I can keep this at the media ctr plessand she said O.K
3,Solid teen fiction,"Not too bad - historical fiction for teens that imagines what Marjorie Bruce, daughter of Scottish King Robert Bruce, would have been thinking during the early portion of her imprisonment in a cage by Longshanks. The memoir format is very popular in historical fiction, and I think some teens respond well to a less formal approach to the narrative."
5,Excellent Santa Wig & Beard Set,"I make costumes and have purchased this set previously for Santa costumes. Can't go wrong for quality, color and care. Both wig and beard are pretty long which, gives you the option to having it cut / styled shorter by a hairdresser if you want a shorter look. Will probably buy another one by next Christmas."
4,After Dark,"Being an avid reader of this genre and a great fan of Jayne Castle (JAC), I found the characters intriguing and the plot very original. Lydia is a Para Rez recovering after a nightmare brush with an alien trap in the catacombs of the Dead City of Old Cadence. Working at Shrimpton's House of Ancient Horrors and trying to get her private sector consulting business up and running, she meets Emmett London, an ex-guild boss who hires her to find a missing family heirloom. After finding a dead body in a sarcophagus and dealing with a nasty ghost that scorches her bedroom wall and learning that her new client is one of the most dangerous people in the city is just the beginning of this off world adventure. Jayne Castle has a new hit; I read it cover to cover in one night."
3,Good read,Was an interesting turn to the normal readingPage turning with a nice twist can't wait go read the next one
3,Pretty Good,"I'm a big Jayne fan and look forward to all of her books, though my personal preference is for the Amanda Quick period pieces. After her three former futuristic novels about Harmony, all of which were excellent, After Dark was a bit of a letdown. The characters and the plot just weren't as solid as her previous efforts, and I found myself wanting more details of both than she supplied and wished she'd tied up all the loose ends. Exploration and resolution of her experieces during the Lost Weekend would have made this a much better book than it was. I would agree with other reviewers that the novel is richer if you've read the three preceeding ones. With those disclaimers, however, this is still worth reading, because even less-than-the-best Jayne is better than most other romance writers, and she creates a nicely imaginative world for the reader. I particularly liked the Fuzz creature. All in all, not her best work, but certainly a decent effort."
2,Sorry I waited,"I love Jane Ann Krentz's paranormal series but I am extremely disappointed in this book. I have enjoyed other books in the Ghost Hunter series and wanted to start at the beginning. It is extremely hard to like Lydia. She is described as sweet, nice and honest but every time she talked you realized what a snob she is. Her comments about the guild and her obvious disdain for the world Emmet belongs to makes it hard to believe he would be interested in her. I found it REALLY hard to like Lydia, sorry but I can't stress that enough. I am hoping she warms up in the second part of hers and Emmett's story, AFTER GLOW, but so far this book is my least favorite of the series."
5,romance/sci-fi crossover,"The thrill of a romance and the satisfaction of a good sci-fi. The premise deals with a planet where the occupants originally came from earth, but have been cut off from it for a couple generations. The settlers now have their own, different planetary and genetic history that create the background for this story. I recommend it to Laurell Hamilton/Anita Blake fans and to Dara Joy/Dark series fans. It is a favorite sci-fi romance mystery and I am sorry to see that others have given it so little credit for a successful change in venue. I would love to see another book(s) based on these characters or simply using the same background."
5,Great story!!,"Of all Jayne Castle's books, I love this the most. Oh, her other books (Zinnia, Orchid, Amaryllis) are okay, but somehow they sound the same once you read all three of them. 'After Dark' is rather different.The first time I read this book, I was kinda frustrated with the fact that so many 'jargons' are introduced, that made the first few pages rather confusing and 'messy'. But when you go deeper into the book, you will be amazed at how the story unfolds - the ghost hunters, the ghosts, ghost duels, the illusion traps - very, very creative story-telling here.Oh, and I especially love Lydia's pet dust bunny, Fuzz. Very cute, with his 'daylight eyes' and 'hunting eyes' and the fact that it is addicted to, of all things, pretzels.Very good story telling here, believe me."
1,Not worth the money,"Lately I have been very disappointed with Jayne Anne Krantz/Amanda Quick/Jayne Castle and sadly this book is continuing that trend. The science fiction aspect of it was neither smart nor believeable. The characters were flat and uninteresting. The love affair was practically non-existant. (After 270 pages they FINALLY come together, in a boring love-scene that is less than a page and a half long.) It makes me wonder if someone else is writing some of these more recent books, with the publishing house using Jayne's name to sell them. If so, they are ruining her good name!! If not, shame on you Jayne! As an equally annoyed friend of mine remarked to me: Maybe Jayne should stop churning out these formula books every six months and take a whole year to write one good one!"
3,Good story weak on romance!,"This is the fourth book by Jayne Castle I've read and enjoyed. Futuristic romances are fluff reading for me and I don't usually retain them very well. When I read ""After Dark,"" I didn't recall that Harmony was also the locale in her other three books, ""Amaryllis,"" ""Orchid,"" and ""Zinnia."" Perhaps if the heroine Lydia Smith was named Petunia or Rose it might have clicked for me. This did not distract or hinder my enjoyment of this book. Ms. Castle is indeed proficient at writing a good mystery, spiced with a little romance. In this book, however, ""little romance"" is the key. The story line was a good read, but if you're looking for steamy romance, don't expect to work up a sweat."
3,My first futuristic paranormal romance...,"left me a bit confused at first but left me satisfied at the end. I was a bit lost in the beginning because I didn't understand the ""historical backdrop"" of the plot and had some difficulty following along. But sexy Emmet London and fiesty Lydia Smith's world was more than interesting enough to keep me reading. I love Emmet's sense of humor and was amazed at Lydia's resistance to him! I love it when two people have instant attraction in the story, it's so much more fun to read. Of course, once I got past the confusion, I really enjoyed the story. (Though, the book was too short!!) I did find Jayne Castle ""para-rez"" terminology like ""UDEMs"" and ""rezzed"" quite entertaining."
2,A disappointment,"JAK cant write bad book. But.... After creating a complex futuristic world in the earlier books, why abandon it now? Why change tha basis of technology? Why change the basis of relationships between mature people. The love story hardly gets started and the book fizzles out with no natural conclusion. Sorry Jayne, I will keep buying your books for now, but stop testing me!"
2,Disappointed!,I usually enjoy Jayne Castle books (Amanda Quick and JAK as well) but this one was boring! I could not get into the characters. I ended up skiming through just to get it done. A waste of money.
3,Loveless,"Not once in did Lydia and Emmett say ""I love you"" to each other. I think that is a very important part of any romance novel. There was no talk of love or marriage. Only a date. This is not her best work. Personally, I like that sweet feeling a good romance novel leaves you with once you hit that last page. I usually smile. Try reading another JC book first. She has some really great ones out."
3,ok book,"I've liked Jane Castle since her first book Amaryllis and all the other ones since unfortunately I found this one lacking in the usual scene grabber. The book dragged on and did not show to much on the love interest and the plot was not so good. Dont get me wrong I love Janes books but this one was not up to snuff the cliffhanger ending was not so detailed. The climax came to fast and the supposed ""action"" scene was not exciting. I think if she would have focused on emmett and lydia it would have worked more."
3,Unsatisfied!,"I enjoyed the book, until the end. It was almost as if my book was missing the final chapter. I had too many unanswered questions! What really happened during the ""lost weekend""? Was she set up by the ghost hunters? Will Lydia and Emmett get together for more than just a date? What happened to the cabinet?!!I don't agree that you have to read the previous Jayne Castle books first. There is little continuity between the previous books. No mention of being professionally matched for marriage, none of the same characters, no coff-tea!Of course I can't wait to read the next one!"
2,A Disappointing Read,"I'm a big Jayne Castle fan and thought this would be some sort of continuation or pre-quel to her last sci-fi trilogy. Set in a similar environment, a world created after settlers came through the ""Curtain,"" I never did figure out how, of if, this book works in relation to her others. While her characters do possess psyhic powers, the powers are different, and not nearly as interesting. The book was rather lackluster and the chemistry between the hero and heroine never clicked for me. It was a quick, and forgettable, read. Although still a big fan, I'd say this book would make me pause before picking up my next Jayne Castle novel."
1,"Dull, Uninteresting and Not Worth the Price","I have read all of the Jayne Castle books and really enjoyed them; however, this one is sorry. There is no spark between Lydia, para-archeologist and Emmett London, businessman, formerly ghost hunter. They're just blah.The plot, if you can call it that, does not hold your interest. In fact, the further you read the more you'll decide ""Who cares"". This is not one of Jayne Castle's best efforts."
3,so-so,"This is set in the same futuristic world as her story, ""Bridal Jitters"" in Charmed. It's not nearly as good. She seems more intent on the setting and the mystery the main characters, Lydia and Emmett, are trying to solve, than on the romance. There is some sexual tension and a couple love scenes, but very little emotional conflict. Lydia spends most of the book griping about people in Emmett's profession, and Emmett spends most of the book being enigmatic. At the very least, I expect a declaration of love at the end of a romance novel, if not a commitment. Maybe there will be a sequel, because this book doesn't feel finished."
2,What happened?,"A true disappointment from one of my favorite all time authors. Lets talk chemistry. Their is none between the two main characters lydia and Emmett. The storyline never takes off. I can say that this is the first Jayne Ann Krentz book that I was able to put down. This book lacks all the elements that made Orchid, Amaryliss and Zinnia fanatastic reading which was characters that came alive, chemistry that was so hot you couldnt put down the book for a minuted so you could absorb every delicious detail. After Dark, not a favorite."
3,From a die-hard JAK fan...,"I hated to give this book only 3 stars, but unfortunately, that is all it deserved. I am always ready to buy any new Jayne Ann Krentz book, but this one certainly didn't live up to expectations. While the romance and intrigue were interesting and fast-paced, for the first time I felt that the setting overshadowed the plot. I'm not a huge fan of futuristic romance, but I always read a book with an open mind. I loved her other books of this nature, Amaryllis, Zinnia..., but I just could not get past the awkwardness of the setting in After Dark. If you are an avid JAK reader, buy the book. If you are considering this book as your first introduction to Jayne Ann Krentz, I highly recommend you start with a different book so that you don't get a bad first impression."
2,Not complete,"I have read all in the series for Harmony. I found this one lacking in several areas. The characters were not well developed. The overuse of the word ""rez"" made me want to white out all references to it. The ending was too abrupt, with no background information on the secret client. The love scenes are, in my opinion, what makes Jayne Castle's books enjoyable. This one falls short. This does not mean that I will stop purchasing her books. On the contrary, I have always enjoyed her style of writing and will continue to do so."
1,Bitter Disapointment,"I have loved all of Jayne Castle's fururistic romances until this one. It was so poorly written I checked to be sure it really was her book. All the things I loved about Harmony in the other three books, are missing from this one and I felt cheated. Part of the enjoyment, for me, was thinking about how things like cof-tea really would have tasted. I realize that remembering and thinking all these things out make it a lot harder to write the book but this most recent effort seemed like it was just thrown together. Those of us who read all your books feel like we know this world you have made, their special talents, moral background, culture. A lot of time was spent designing and explaining this in other books. I am fascinated when you introduce new talents so this book shouldn't have been any different but it was. I felt cheated. Please Jayne go back to your old format, I need your laughter in my life."
2,Let down,"If you're a Jayne Ann Krentz fan like me you might really be looking forward to ""After Dark"", but I was really let down. It was very hard to care about the main characters in this story. I kept reading hoping it would get better but it didn't. I've read Krentz's other books writting as Jayne Castle and relly enjoyed them, so my advice is to read one of her Jayne Castle books."
3,good but I hope there will be more of this story,"I liked the book but thought it was missing something.It wasn't as good as Amaryllis,Zinna,and Orchid. The plot was interesting with Lydia's quest to redeem her professional life and Emmett's search for a family heirloom that dissapeared with his nephew. While working together to solve the mystery their differing views create a definite friction between them. I thought that the characters were terrific but that they didn't start really connecting romantically until to near the end of the book. Now I am hoping that there is going to be another book with these two to develop their romance to a passionate conclusion. If that is what Ms.Castle(Jayne Ann Krentz) is planning I will be first in line to buy the second book."
1,Disappointed in this series.,"I usually love all of Jayne Castle's work, and Amanda Quick's, too, but I was seriously disappointed in this new series. The entire premise just seemed to convoluted and contrived. I generally like science fiction as well as supernatural romances, but these characters seemed not to be that well thought out. I felt that the whole world with its resonances, crystals, etc. just needed more work. Creating an entire culture from scratch has to be difficult, but she needs to take this one back to the drawing board."
3,AMBER STONE POWER IN SCIENCE FICTION,"This book gives a futuristic look into a parallel universe where antique hunting is a major revenue, causing the usual problems that inevitably occur when big money in involved. It's a universe where humans with well-developed psychic powers can summon ghosts for protection and destruction. In this universe, there are also other humans with intensive ghost-fighting powers. The story starts with the discovery of a dead body and no suspects. Then it continues until the killers and the reason are found. Amber stones worn by everyone and the color green play important roles also. Behind the mystery and the powers, there's a small love story brewing. AFTER DARK is a science fiction story where a highly vivid imagination is mandatory."
2,terrible,"unfortunately this is her worst book ever. Although I have enjoyed almost all of her other books tremendously and she is by far my favorite romance novel, this book is not well put together and leaves the reader lost with many lose ends that are not explained properly. a big disappointment"
2,After Dark,"Let me start by stating that I am a BIG fan of Jayne Ann Krentz and was anxious to read her latest. I was very disappointed. It is not that I am oppossed to futuristic books, have you read JD Robb(Nora Roberts) Death series? I found the plot very difficult to follow, especially if it was not read in one sitting. Each time I came back to it I needed to do a quick review. Too much ""rez this and rez that"". Also, I found the interaction of Lydia and Emmett to be very cold . No chemistry here. All in all, a big yawn. Sorry JAK, this one didn't do it for me."
2,After Dark,"A real disappointment. The only thing going for it was it wasn't the same story again ( like Amaryllis, Orchid, and Zinnia were the same story with new characters). The beginning was slow, slow and hard to follow. It picked up as it progressed, but never was particularly interesting, and the ending left you somewhere near the beginning - ie nowhere. She still had the same job, she never got paid, and the romance had no commitment. Don't waste your money."
4,My faith is redeemed,I recently picked up After Dark and was completely surprised. I had been losing faith in JAK because the books were becoming repetitive. With this book and Eclipse Bay I see great books in the future. When I first read it I thought someone else must have written it because it was so different from what she had been putting out recently. I am pleased and excited to learn more. The only thing I didn't like was the even pacing that had defned the book being rushed at the end. the ending was just a little too pat for me. Otherwise it was an excellent book.
2,Falls short of emotion,"I enjoyed the premise, but the characters were wooden and predictable. It was about a man who just kept making passes at a woman who continuously fended him off, until in the end she reciprocated. There was no emotion, or heat, or seduction. There did seem like there would have been opportunity for that, but it just never materialized."
3,A little disappointed...,"After reading the Da Vinci Code, I wanted a book that could debunk the falsehoods presented in Dan Brown's book. I turned to this book only to find a cursory overview of some of the fallacies presented in the Da Vinci Code. This book was really similar, only on a much more concise basis, to Stobel's The Case for Christ. I would keep looking if you're looking for an in-depth analysis of the Da Vinci Code."
5,They don't come any better..,"Inside Moves is, in my opinion, one of the best movies ever. It's got heart and soul. It moves you, in a great way. If it doesn't, you might wanna check your pulse..."
5,GOOD MOVES!,Great movie about the human spirit! Shows how a person can hit rock-bottom then climb back out and find happiness thru friendship and perserverence.
4,"A Good Film, Herder FInd","This film is rather difficult to find, in fact I had not even heard about until an older family member recommended it to me.It was a good film, with good acting. However the script and plot were only so-so. Yet as a feel good film you can not go wrong."
5,FINALLY,"I can hardly wait until 3 Feb....release date for this movie.When we got our first VHS player in 1982, we rented this movie. It became one of my favorites the first time I saw it.It showed up on cable years later for a few times, but who could afford a recorder. So now that we can record even DVDs, ""Inside Moves"" is never on TV.No one that I know has ever seen this movie and I always tell them they missed out seeing a great one.It is really worth the time and money. I will be at the stores 3 Feb early, so I can come home and watch the movie. I know it was great on VHS, and I can hardly wait to see the DVD on my big screen."
5,Finally!!,Just another note to say this is a great movie that should be released on DVD. Hope it happens soon.4/10/10I finally saw this on DVD after a 30 year wait. It is just as good as I remember it. The acting of Savage and Scarwid is great. You should buy this DVD!! A feel good story with real characters and a director who gives the actors time to act.
4,"A Winner about ""Losers""","It's possible only a few of us saw this movie in the theatres, but we are a loyal group of fans. The characters ARE characters, each seemingly a misfit with his/her own unique story. A neighborhood bar in San Francisco is eventually ""home"" for this group of people who exemplify the definition of ""extended family."" Humor, music, drama, tears, some startling violence, and (finally!) even some romance. This is a movie that is difficult to adequately describe, but easy to eagerly recommend. I cannot imagine anyone watching this film and not being touched by its messages. Enjoy!"
5,Great Movie,"Great acting, low budget movie that did not get enough credit. Launched David Morse's career. He is one great living soul, who left the armpit of Hollywood to make sure his family lived in a better life environment. Still married to his wonderful wife of many years. Too bad Hollywood does not reflect his talent and values."
1,Ugh,"There is a reason this book is out of print. It's filled with enough 90's grunge to make you vomit. One of my Graphic Design professors required it for his class, and I'm only keeping it as an example of what not to do with my own work, ever."
3,Enjoyable but a bit simplistic,"This book reminded me of reading Nancy Drew stories. The writing was kind of elementary: short sentences, basic storyline, somewhat one dimensional characters, a few plot twists...likeable but not terribly sophisticated. That said, I did read it straight through in one sitting and enjoyed it overall. The editing was a bit messy; ""desert"" instead of ""dessert,"" etc."
4,Featherlite Robin Ballroom Shoe,"I'm a new ballroom student, so I don't have a ton of experience with ballroom dancing shoes. However, I find this shoe to be very comfortable, especially in terms of heel stability and padding under the ball of the foot. I did get a couple of blisters around my heels, but nothing you wouldn't expect from any new pair of shoes rubbing in new places. The only reason I gave this shoe 4 instead of 5 stars is that the ankle strap is unaccountably long, and I had to poke extra holes in it in order to get the buckle tight enough. Otherwise, especially considering the price, I am very happy with this shoe."
5,Pad Works Great,"This Gun Cleaning Pad works great. I have one that I purchased from a local sporting goods store that went out of business. I couldn't find another one until I found this one through Amazon. (I bought a second one for my brother.) I've had mine for 2 years and have not noticed any signs of wear. It works to protect the table surface you're working on, at the same time the protective coating on the bottom prevents it from slipping and prevents liquid from leaking through the green felt material. I use my mat to clean my pistols. Another convenient feature - it folds easily and fits into a plastic container that I keep all my gun cleaning tools/ materials in."
4,"Great, simple recipes","This is one of my favorite cookbooks - especially for working days. There's a great section in the beginning about stocking your pantry, and he even includes mail-order sources in the back for the few, hard-to-find ingredients. As other reviewers, I've never been able to prepare any of these dishes in 15 minutes, but they are fairly quick, and simple to prepare. My two favorites are the Flank Steak Salad, and the Moroccan Chicken Soup. I found both the San Diego Fish Tacos, and Shrimp & Goat Cheese Quesadillas too greasy for my taste, but enjoyed the other recipes I've made. I would definitely recommend this book to working folks who want to eat nutritious & tasty meals, with a minimum of effort."
1,"""Light Zombie""","A dreary follow-up to the Halperins' ""White Zombie"" - minus Bela Lugosi and the atmospheric qualities associated with the 1932 horror classic. Despite the offbeat Cambodia setting, ""Revolt of the Zombies"" (1936) is a lifeless disappointment. Random close-ups of Bela's eyes and Arthur Martinelli's photography cannot redeem this 65-minute journey into boredom. Dean Jagger (miscast beyond belief) makes a poor substitute for Lugosi."
2,Header misleads,"Why is this entitled FRIGHT NIGHT 3? Its an older movie about zombies...good, but the header is misleading. i think in the Fright Nights there were only 2-unless this is a general description like Elvira's Fright Night...zombie"
4,Good collection of early movie songs,"We may have to wait until PBS does a special to get a really comprehensive overview of film music. However, until then, you can enjoy a decent collection of early film music by obtaing this compilation of the first 21 songs to win the Oscar for Best Song with the original singers. These years included classics like Bob Hope's ""Thanks for the Memory"", Bing Crosby's ""White Christmas"", Judy Garland's ""Over the Rainbow"", Sarah Vaughn's ""It Might As Well Be Spring"" and Nat King Cole's ""Mona Lisa"". Only a couple of songs have noticeably annoying background noise. The only drawback is the lack of good liner notes."
3,Lenovo 3000 n100 core duo,This notebook's performance is acceptable for most applications so far. I like the display. The keyboard handles well. I still have difficulties using the touchpad to scroll after approx. two months. I had to upgrade the memory to 1GB.I get confused sometimes with the many utilitise provided to help the user.It would be a great notebook except for the problem below.The huge problem I have is the palm rests gets extremely hot on both sides of the touchpad and I cannot get any assistance as to what to do about it.
1,Not a good value!,"Ok first of all i was fooled because the package says it packed 57 grams of protein per serving. This is true, but you have to consume 4 giant scoops in one serving. The scoop that comes with the bucket is twice the size of any other protein i have ever taken. When you do the figuring one scoop is only equal to 14 grams of protein. Most protein powders are about 20-25 grams per scoop and the scoop is about have the size of this product. This is not a good value, I think the stuff they sell at the grocery store is even better then this. And it does not mix well, even when shaken violently. I would not ever buy this product again. Oh ya let me also say that this stuff taste like rotten baby formula."
3,pie in the sky - forlorn hope for great book,"Hope & Apollo are drawn away on a magical adventure, Hope to be rescued from the demeaning life of a scullery maid, and Apollo from the dreadful influences of his awful family.Although Apollo is snotty, he is a much livelier character than Hope who, although the principal lead, is quite a bore.Unfortunately it is not until 100pgs into this book that it really starts swinging.I understand this book is part of a series of books ""voyage of the basset"" wherein every book is written by a different author.Sadly it is not Tanith Lee's best book YA, and although it may scrape in a bit of appeal for 9-12yr olds, there are better written childrens books around, and some of them by Tanith Lee!I recommend the Claidi books by Tanith Lee, Red Unicorn, Black Unicorn & Gold Unicorn, Diana Wynne Jones books Adventures of Chrestomanci,"
5,the truth finally comes out,"I lived the al dunlap saga first hand. Breakfasts, luncheons, and diners with the man as well as frequent barbs and threats. I was as close to the story as any outsider could be. But I must confess; John Byrne's account of the Sunbean story was told better and more accurately than either I or any insider could tell it. Byrne is a pro's pro. I would probably read anything he wrote since I would know that it was written with honesty, integrity and passion. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the mind of deception and the evil of greed."
4,The Chainsaw is Cut,"Hmmm Interesting book. Recommended the fall is well documented. How many lives did he ruin 100,000?. All for his ego. Just a carpetbagger hated in Mobile and Montgomery. Also read the last comment on the back it tells the story. The SEC will tell the rest.!"
4,Some interesting pictures.,"I have not read this book yet - I bought it for it's pictures. It has pictures of some interesting planting combinations and hardscape applications. It contains chapters on Garden History, overviews of various styles (cottage, oriental, wild, parterre), ""sense of place"" (entries vs. landmarks vs. contemplation vs. workplace, etc.), elements of the garden (paving, light, water, structures, plant palette), a chapter w/ summaries of 15 diff. designers and a chapter on garden wisdom (planning, basics, revision & restoration). The book is well organized and designed and, again, has good pictures. It also has information on sources for plants and materials but since the book is from 1984 it is most likely completely outdated. Not essential but still quite nice."
2,"depth, but not 3d","i bought this system today and have tried 3 dvds with it, used all the different settings, and so far it offers more depth perception, but is definitely not jump-off-the-screen 3d. plus it kinda hurts my eyes. i was disappointed"
5,Fascinating,"Dishonest marketing aside, this is a fascinating film about life and death and fate.Looking over the DVD box I can see why one might feel fooled. This is not Due Date. This is an independent film that is all about amazing acting performances and a great script.I got the feeling that the guy in the previous post didn't even watch it. Yes, Zach Galifinakis is in only one (though long, and crucial) scene. It just seems more like a role his pre-Hangover fans would love."
4,Frenemy or Ally-Foe?,"...either title would have been inappropriate for this movie. This is a cool little story about 2 guys (who we don't really have a grip on until pretty far in) who are up to something (maybe insidious, possibly righteous) I have no idea why Zach G. is on the front cover (I speculate it was done in an effort to capitolize on his recent success) as he plays a minor character, but I did enjoy his performance. The main actors give solid performances, especially Callum Blue, a British import. This movie is quirky, with a slick, dark humor about it that I loved. The ending (no spolier alert dont worry) is very interesting (perhaps over my head). Definitely check this out if you like new takes on film noir crime stories."
1,horrible,"WOW this movie is horrible..... its not worth watching, a complete waste of time. I would give this a zero star but cant."
3,False Advertising,"Rented this from Redbox today hoping for a funny comedy, but what I got was an artsy fartsy film about good and evil and fate. Galifinakas plays a very small role in the very beginning of the movie and doesn't show up the rest of the movie. There is absolutely nothing funny about this movie whatsoever ,so I don't see how they can call it a comedy. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie and it's worth watching, just know what you are getting into before you watch it."
1,Horrible!,"no plot, no point, NO FUNNY. i watched it and don't have a clue as to what this movie was trying to tell us. dont waste your time or money. you'd be better entertained watching paint dry."
4,Excellent script pulled off by talented actors,"This movie is beyond trippy. The weird thing about it with Mathew Modine's character who plays Evil in the form of human influence is that you cannot fault anything he says cause its all true. Which makes you end up liking him in a weird way and you end up feeling sorry for the man who through self discovery comes to terms with the fact that he is a serial killer and therefore evil. Mathew Modine's character causes certain situations to arise requiring the choice in which to act good or act evil, as we have have our own free will and cannot be forced into anything we must be influenced heavily either in the right way or in this case the wrong way. I encourage people to watch this movie it is deep,intelligent,and witty not to mention great editing of the movie aswell."
1,Horrible Movie,"No plot and no direction - this should be removed from the ""comedy"" section because there isn't anything funny about it. Sorry Zach, you have been funny in the past but not with this flop."
1,Suckage in it's purest form,"I paid a $1 and wish I had downloaded it but then it wouldn't have been worth the bandwidth. When I saw Gregory Dark of porn fame directed it I knew it would be a turd ball and it was. Seriously, do all indie flicks have to put Ron Jeremy in them?If I want Carl Jung style I'll read a book. Crap cubed."
1,Braindead Entertainment?,"After the second portrayal of the ""Jerry Springer""-like program in this lame-o movie, I decided that maybe this movie would actually appeal to people that like Jerry Springer. It seems possible that this is the level on which this incredibly bogus film might be interesting or even entertaining. SUCKS on every level and a waste of time and money."
1,Useless waste of time n money !,What the hell was this all about??? I think Mathew Modine did this as a favor he owed to someone! Maybe he lost a bet!!!! Maybe he did it as a dare!
1,Frenemy - what is that all about,"Pretty damn dire. Some people watch movies like this and like them because they're 'artistic'. I never liked a movie described like that. 'Mainstream' is what the general populous like, which is most people. If most people don't like a movie, it's not artistic, it's just rubbish. That's what this is. Disappointing because I like Zach Galifianakis which is why I got it."
1,Horrible!!!!!!!,Thought this movie would be funny with Zach Galifianakis in it but he was literally in the movie for one scene lasting less than 10 minutes! It was obviously enough to get him on the cover.
2,another one for the pile,"yes, another brilliant assemblage of Solefald play. masters of their instruments, writer(s) witty lyrics and satire... Solefald, yes, but, again, this is Solefald. after masturbating in harmonium-style, ala metal-progressive, you might feel that there's really not much emotional groove. too heady?track that might last til tomorrow: Buy My Sperm.Try something new, guys."
3,The price,I thought for the price of 31.98I was getting all 4 sets of card. The way its displayed you think you are. The 1 Box of cards is worth 15.00. Do not understand.
1,Not Samsung Toner - it is Substitute,I ordered the Samsung Toner Cartridge as the name suggests in the Title and received an after market substitute Toner cartridge. If I wanted a substitute cartridge I could have purchased one for $44.
5,Fabulous training tips for every dog...and every dog owner!,"Martens' energetic style of training the pet *** and the owner*** is fresh,logical, easy to follow, and something other trainers overlook. Her approach of people-training is essential and she's taught *me* to have patience with my pup, making the training process all the easier. It is obvious that she has a real passion for what she does and that she does it well. The step-by-step instructions, hints for owners of both new and adopted/older dogs, and the stories of how her celebrity clients have overcome their dog-training hurdles are fantastic. Not only is this method effective, the book is fun, too! Paws for a Minute is perfect for anyone starting a new adventure with his/her first puppy, and it is a great refresher course for anyone who has had a dog previously and has just taken in another."
4,The Red Lion Inn Cookbook,"Unlike many ""Inn"" cookbooks I've seen, this book is full of excellent, well written recipes which range from breakfasts to elegant meals. All the recipes have a distinctly New England flair. The roast beef hash is exceptional, as is the baked stuffed shrimp."
4,same as transmutation live but with a bonus track,I thought I would be getting an all new live Praxis CD but actually I only got one song. If you dont have transmutation live and you like buckethead or praxis then definatly pick it up. If you have transmutation live only buy this if you want the extra track
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,"It is a total disappointment that the order for this book was placed on 22 June 2005 and till date - July 29, 2005, the same has not been received.The purpose of placing a priority shipment order is totally lost.This book was required to a course, which now comes to a close in the next 10 days."
4,Daughter was please,Purchased this as a gift for my daughter. She liked the ladles and theyappeared to be a good quality for the money.
5,Nabisco Ginger Snaps-The BEST,"These are crunchy and very tasty! I order these on a regular basis as I do not want to be out of them. Great for snacks, wonderful for many recipes or to put together with pudding, and so much more!"
1,I love ginger snaps...,"...but these taste like cardboard. The texture is reminiscent of cardboard too. I grew up loving ginger snaps and when our go-to brand was no longer available at our grocery store, we gave these a try. Needless to say, I soon stopped eating ginger snaps. They are hard as rocks out of the box, yet when they get stale you can bend them almost in half before they fall apart. Stay away. I just picked up a different brand after all these years and now I'm reminded what I've been missing."
3,Atlas Has Shrugged,We are breaking the back of the economic American Atlas..A period of decline and violence most likely awaits us..Stamp out liberal victim seekers wherever you find them. If you sit on a jury make it a point to punish those who yearn for the victim lottery..The alternative is decay and spasmodic irrational violence in an imploding economy.
1,Pointless Scolding,"He accuses us of being a nation of whiners. This book proves conclusively that HE is a whiner, but he does not represent the entire nation. It is just another in a long line of pointless books scolding me and you for nothing in particular. If he were honest he would offer some constructive suggestions. He offers no suggestions for how we can overcome the sins he accuses us of -- unless you consider ""stop whining"" to be a helpful suggestion."
1,"A waste of paper, ink and my time.","Save yourself $ and a few dull hours of reading (unless you like to read a lot of complaining). After a fairly decent Prologue and first chapter the author takes what should be an interesting and timely topic and offers little. He seems to be fixated on what he sees as the substition of Psychology for religion. Ah, if only we could go back to the good old days (pre 20th century attitudes) everything would be wonderful. To his credit Mr. Sykes does not claim victim status for himself but obviously feels victimized by a changing society that has left him behind."
5,It is not my fault!!!!,"Millionaire in 365 Days: The Daily Plan to Get ThereIt is not my fault....I deserve this or that...NOW !We are not responsible...we are victims....pay me, help me...I am a victim...WOW>>>>>revealing and TRUE......sadly."
5,william and kate,william and kate was a all in all great movie was very happy with this movie would tell other's to buy this movie
2,William and Kate,What a love story. I have watched it may times. Sometime almost everyday. Now that the actress who played Kate is on GA
4,Great dvd,This was given as a gift. It was greatly appreciated. Thank you! I would do this again! The wedding was the most celebrated wedding of the year...
3,Sappy but good,"I first watched this movie on cable and recently I bought the DVD at Wal-Mart, I thought it was sappy and full of what I call ""cheesy"" romantic stuff that I doubt HRH Prince William would do but as a huge Royal fan, I'd pretty much put up with any movie having to do with the royals. The acting was at best decent but I think that the scriptwriters should have put better lines and more facts in the movie but with all the hype the Royal Wedding caused they had to make the movie into some sappy romance."
5,"Excellent, thought-provoking biography","This book is an unusual, thought-provoking means of telling the story of Bessie Coleman's life. Written in free verse, Bessie's story is told by the people who attend her funeral, her family, friends, and acquaintances. Each voice is intriguing, weaving a complex tapestry of this noteworthy woman's life. Teachers and dramatists take note--what a great book to use for reader's theatre or as a play. E.B. Lewis' illustrations are perfect for the book, setting the right tone for each voice, and his portraits of each speaker bring them alive, talking to us as though we were there at the memorial service. I'm giving this as a gift to several children I know!"
1,"incredibly disorganized, and outdated too","this ranks as the worst casebook I've ever had the ill-fortune of being forced to read throughout my three years of law school. The fact that it is outdated and thus incorrect on many points is annoying enough. But, even worse is that the book has no sense of organization or direction, and most of its notes are worthless. I definitely expected more from the Aspen Law & Business publisher, whose text books are usually pretty good. You're almost better off not reading this book at all."
1,Ginger coriander salt,"Don't waste your money.I'm a real foodie and I have at least six different kinds of salt: Indian black salt, smoked Kosher salt, sea salt with red pepper,Spike and several varieties of Mrs. Dash salt substitute.Since I like both coriander and ginger, I thought that those spices mixed with salt would be terrific. I was very wrong."
3,you get what you pay for,"The machine is easy enough to use, but it is painfully slow. The worst part about this fax is the seemingly random ""Check Paper"" messages that appear on the display and halt whatever the fax is doing at that time. The ability to copy is a plus. If you are looking for a home fax machine that you will seldom use, this may be the one for you since it's cheap and it works but if you are running any kind of business, look elsewhere."
4,easy gets the job done,"Great sturdy little fax/copier. East to setup, simple user-friendly buttons & menus. Uses plain paper. Stores incoming faxes in memory if you run out of paper, and prints them as soon as you add more paper. It is slow if you set it higher than standard quality, but mine has run 10 years with no errors, or repairs. The phone is handy too. Solid, reliable, well-made. I love it's simplicity."
4,100 Years of Adventure and Discovery,"I wanted a copy of this as my grandfathers brother, Mathew Stirling was featured in an article! It was in good condition."
4,Great value..,Like the title says its a great value and its built pretty good also.I generally use this for motorcycle repairs..
3,Seems cheap yet effective,"This wrench feels pretty chintzy and the knob at the base used to lock the handle into place for a certain torque setting tends to stick open or closed. Maybe a bit of oil would help there. The wrench does function well and seems accurate enough. I don't have a way to calibrate or check it, though."
1,CHE*E*E*E*E*EAP ! ! ! !,"Received it in broken condition, ratchet does not work, but still usable. Not worth sending back , I'll know better next time."
1,Buy something better.,"After years of getting away without a torque wrench, I figured I should buy one and get it over with. I really wanted a fancy one, but thought that with the little use I'd give it, it would be a waste. This was a mistake. This wrench would not click at any setting to let me know the desired torque was reached. I dropped it to the lowest setting, put it on one of my trailer lugs, and pulled as hard as I could. Never clicked. I guess I could have just gotten a bad one, but I'm not taking a chance on another. Guess I'll order the Gearwrench and get it over with."
1,Not worth the money,"The wrench stopped working after the first use. I had to Torque a trailer tongue to 100lbs. This worked fine. I then had to go to 35lbs, and the wrench would not go below 100. I tried to go to the lowest setting and it still did not work. I wound up estimating the torque for the 35lbs."
2,The tool was not the one I ordered,"The tool i ordered supposed to come with the case ,the extent ,the hanger and the dice, none of them came with the order.it sould be like the one in the picture..Michigan Industrial Tools MIT Tool 1/2"" Drive Click Torque Wrench KitSo you fool me"
1,"waste of money, broke on the first use",Save your money and put it toward something besides this. Broke on the first use. Over-torquing manifold bolts may have done some serious damage. Definitely stay away from this product!!!! A real piece of crap.
4,good wrench but instructions are wrong,"The instructions say that the vernier, or micrometer scale, has 10 divisions between the major torque markings. This is wrong. There are 15. If you just follow the provided instructions you will be setting the torque incorrectly. Also, there is a small ""plastic cap"" whose function appears to be to keep dirt and debris from getting inside the wrench. It falls off at the slightest touch. So I taped it in place. I guess you get what you pay for. Having dealt with the use issue it appears to be an OK torque wrench, especially for the money."
1,Bad Wrench,Worked for a couple of times then just locked up. I checked it with a calibrated wrench at work and it was about 10 oz/in under. Poor quality and not trustworthy.
5,Great tool for the home mechanic.,I had my doubts about the accuracy of this tool. But I took a chance and had the accuracy checked at work. It was very accurate and well worth the price.
4,Does the job.,"If you follow the directions, they this torque wrench works superbly. As with any torque wrench, it you need to reset it back to zero when resting. Never leave it torqued when storing it."
3,"more like ""The Individual Glyphs of Ancient Egypt""","I am torn regarding this book. While it is an exellent study of the individual signs, covering several stages in the evolution of the particular glyph in hieroglyph, hieratic, and demotic characters, it lacks grammer and even word structure aside from a fraction of a page in the introduction. If you are a student of hieroglyphics in the history of the Egyptian culture this could be a most useful book. It is also entertaining and informative to the casual reader, but a student of Egyptian grammer would do better to look elsewhere. Perhaps to Gardiner's ""Egyptian Grammar."" Betro's book is not, in my opinion, the ""complete handbook"" it claims to be."
5,Perfect for your little hunter in your life,This tin sign is very adorable for any little boys room or a family room. The price i paid for it was well worth the money. My little one will get may years use out of this sign in his room
1,Very Disappointed!,"We placed an order for some Lindt Lindor truffles 2 weeks before Christmas that were PROMISED to arrive before Christmas - They did not!!!WE are NOT happy with the delivery service from this company.Plus, have not been offered any appolgies or anything to make up for this huge letdown."
4,"Durable, good quality, great value","I have had this monitor for over a year with not a single problem.And it takes a beating, changing from one cpu to another several times a week. No problems what so ever. Great value."
1,Sceptre X20 SV Naga died after six months!!,"This product is garbage & Sceptre customer service is terrible. My TV blacked out after only six months & now I have to send it to CA at my cost so they can determine whether the problem falls within the scope of their ""limited warranty"" or whether I have to pay a $205 dollar charge for labor & shipping for a $300 TV that's six months old!! I'll never buy a Sceptre again!"
1,This is junk!,"Be very careful about buying from Sceptre. I purchased this item and after about a year it stopped working. After calling Sceptre, they wanted me to fill out an RMA form and ship the unit to them so they could tell me it doesn't work. They may fix it but would send me an invoice if they decided it got there after the warranty expired. The maintenance costs are more than what the monitor is worth. I would have to pay shipping costs and fill out the form which is very consumer unfriendly. After looking at the RMA form and all the hoops I needed to jump through I decided to cut my losses and buy something else. Not only is it a cheap product (silly me you get what you pay for), the customer service is very user unfriendly and a pain."
2,"Unpractical, unusuable","This item looks good on paper but in practice is quite unusable. In order to have a workable yardage reading from which to select a club, it is necessary to hold the scope absolutely rock solid while sighting on the green pin. This is an impossible task. While the manufacturer acknowledges that the reading is approximate, ""approximate"" takes on whole new meaning with this scope. Readings are easily + or - 20 yards. Compared with this size of an error, my eyeball does equally as good a job."
2,Very cheaply made not worth the price.,"I bought this and found it to be extremely cheaply made and not water proof at all, I would not recommend buying this unless you are looking to waste money on such a poorly made item not even good enough for a gift."
1,Get what you pay for,"rather than spending an extra $10, I bought this one. useless. maybe it's just the one I got, but it's blurry. I had one (that was left in a cart) that I used to find my ball more than for distances, but this one can't focus on anything. you get what you pay for."
4,Takes a steady hand,"This scope is what it is, a small, graduated monocular. You must hold it steady to use it effectively. It should be used to augment your distance estimates, in addition to course markers, etc. You don't get sophistication at this price. For beginning golfers, it's better than a wag!"
1,Disappointed,Description of this item said that it measured a distance of 50 to 300 yards. It only measured a distance of 50 to 200 yards. Very disappointed.
1,I HATE IT!!!!!!!!!!,"it is the worst rangefinder i have ever seen i bought this item thinking that it would actualy ""find"" the ""range"" it is horable"
3,8X monocular - and 200 yard/meter combined ranger,"As a yardage estimate device, it's a 2 star; the grid pattern is supposed to list ""50, 70, 90, 125, 175, 250) on the left of the lens and ""60, 80, 100, 150, 200, 300"" on the right - so that you can line up the flag height to appropriate range height to estimate range with more accuracy. Simple concept that they fail in - Mine simply lists ""50, 75, 100, 150, 200"" on BOTH sides, one side yardage and the other in meters. That said, as an 8X magnified monocular, it's a decent product for cheap! Optics are clear, had no problem with fogging, tiny, easy to keep in the treestand with me for those times when you need a little oomph to identify a buck vs. doe, etc. No replacement for good binoculars, just easy to keep with you. So for an 8X miniature monocular, ok product - as a range estimater - not so great."
2,Jumping Jack,"He could very well be Jack and not Mark because he repeats the phrase ""Jump In"" ad nauseam. I was reminded of the Rolling Stones song ""Jumping Jack Flash"" which is a classic but I digress.It is a story of rags-to-riches told in somewhat candid manner. However, the author doesn't give a glimpse of his past and his psychology other than urging the reader to Jump In (there you go again). His life as a commando as well as his past in England are not told so the story lacks the foundation and thus robs the reader the opportunity to truly discover how Mark's brilliant mind functions.The book is peppered with motivational phrases and if you want to get 'pumped up' (this could be the title of Mark's sequel) then just read the sidebars of the book. It is a forgettable book, overall."
2,"All title,little substance","No doubt Mr.Burnett has achieved great success.But pay closer attention to his ""credible reviews"" on this book.They praise the man,not the book.I bought Trump:Art of the Deal,at a garage sale for a buck.Similar content.Famous author.Great real life stories.But like too many autobiographical self help business books,too much bragging,annd too little substance.We know what you've done,Mr.Burnett,tell us exactly how you did it.Bet his next book has an equally cutesy title."
2,Jumping away is the better choice,"This book did not live up to it's billing. I got it primarily because of the expected insider accounts of ""Survivor"". Burnett didn't have anything to say about ""insider"" information regarding the first show and very little to say about any of the others. I learned more inside information about the survivors from a three-page interview with Jeff Probst I read recently.Burnett does lather on self-laudatory remarks, and sucks up so obviously to Donald Trump and Martha Stewart it makes one think his lips are shaped like a vacuum cleaner.If you want information about set decorating and negotiating the best deals for shows, this is the book for you. If you want what is promised in the write-up on the book jacket, jump away from this trite little money-maker that showcases an ego that knows few bounds."
3,A little too much SURVIVOR and not enough MARK BURNETT,"I would have loved to hear more about the steps Mark took towards success. Reading about survivor for over half the book got rather dull, although the show is his bread & butter. Reading about his experiences coming over from the U.K. as a Para-trooper, ending up a Nanny, selling shirts in Venice Beach from a fence, to his first experiences before Making-It bigtime were very enjoyable.If there would have been more detail on these things and a little less emphasis on every single survivor show then I wouldn't have been able to put it down.If your a survivor nut (which I'm not) then this may just be the book your looking for. If your looking for a truly interesting bio on a power player within the entertainment industry I highly recommend checking out The Operator by Tom King which is all about David Geffen (The G in Dreamworks SKG movie studio, Geffen Records, etc...)"
2,Gets tiring,"While few can argue Mark's rise to fame and fortune is anything but spectacular, but to believe that virtually every decision he's made in his life has turned out fantastically well is a bit hard to swallow. At every turn (which happens to be accompanied by the phrase...""I jumped in..."") is another remarkable success.If he showed a bit more vulnerability in his stories, it would have been more believable, insightful and inspirational.I also could have done without excruciating detail of every season of survivor...it got a bit old."
3,the art of assemblage,i have not yet seen a definitive book which really communicates the art of this architects work. this book is a good value but lacks enough detail drawings or plan drawings although is has some. photography is good and again we need more on this architect.
3,Boring movie but gorgeous star,"This movie is a sad edition to the Emanuelle series. The plot is terrible and the girl, although stunningly beautiful and sexy, is a terrible actress. This movie is fine to rent but don't buy unless you like the actress as much as I do."
2,different item recieved,I recieved the 3 packets fajita mix but it was the low sodium version which was not what the description stated
2,Should be called Indian Fairytales,"I thought this would be more in the vein of grimm brothers, but it seems to be exclusively all indian 'fairytales' from before Canada was discovered. So it has a lot of nature and weird names going on."
3,"great music, horrible sound","Candi Staton is a terrific singer and her Fame-recordings are really great. It's a pity that the sound on this cd is zo horrible. I don't think they used the mastertapes. When will there be a high-quality cd (or cd-box)with all her Fame-recordings? It's a real shame that after thirty years there is still no cd that does justice to these beautiful recordings.Anyhow, this cd is the only one available at the moment... It's better than nothing."
3,slaves and missionaries by mary turner,"dear sir/madam, please send me a 800words review of this book now. It is an emergency I need to know about this book and I from Jamaica."
1,Over priced,This is way over priced for what it is. You can find simular products for around 500 dollars or find one that is better for the same price this one is.
5,A Pragmatic real life guide to Information management,"I found this book to the point, insightful and most of all practical. I highly recommend it to technology professionals in the field of Information management."
3,Worth the read,It's not Timothy Zahn`s best book but I still enjoyed reading it. Very dated however but that somehow adds a bit to the charm of the story.
5,Hard-hitting military science fiction.,"I often find myself disappointed by Timothy Zahn, especially with the inordinate time he spends with fantasy and Star Wars themes. His major contribution to military science fiction writing is via the creation of the Blackcollars and the Cobras. These display Timothy Zahn at his best with convincing plot lines, well-developed characters and interesting stories which make for page turning anticipatory reading. The best recommendation I can offer for Blackcollar is that I own the series. Definitely five star material."
5,Perfect,It was nice to read a good solid clean science fiction book. I won't own any books my kids can't read because of morality issues. I have young kids who read way above grade level and grab books so finding a book that wasn't to tweeny and yet clean was great. Solid adventures with some good turns in plot. Zhann has a way of making you feel like that charecter could be the kid down the streat. Excellent Characterization. Loved the book.
2,Microscope reviews,"Last year I bought a Meade 9460 microscope. I found the 12.5x eyepiece very dark and difficult to use. The x-y controls works ok while moving slides left to right but does not work well when moving the slide back and forth. Also this microscope doesn't come with a 4x objective which comes in handy when trying to locate your specimum on your slide. The microscope is ok but you can buy a much better microscope for a little more money. I looked around the internet and found a microscope for only 33% more than the Meade 9460 and it has 4 objectives, higher power (1600x), much better x-y controls, binocular eyepieces, variable light control, and the objectives are much much clearer than the Meade. For the money the Meade microscope is not a good value when compared to other microscopes out there."
5,Best relaxation CD I own!,"I use this CD every night to help me drift off into a more peaceful, restful sleep. The music is softly flowing, allows your mind to effectively rest. I can't say enough about it!"
3,Cute but scratchy,"It looks exactly how it is pictured, with bright colors and a different car on each side, but like most cheap kids bedding, it is a low thread count so it is more stiff and scratchy. I washed it once, but I may try to wash it again to see if I can soften it up."
2,Great Songs - Terrible Recordings,"These are great songs presented in great performances. However, there has got to be a better recording of them. This thing is painful to listen to..."
4,Pretty okay,"Its a book for ages 2-6. However, my 9 month old still likes looking at the pictures. It is only about 6-8 pages if I recollect. But it is a cute book overall. It can't beat a book like ""Goodnight Moon"". Its not my daugter's favorite yet. But I like the message this book carries."
4,"Live Fast, Die Never",The theme and instrumental pieces recreate the atmosphere of the show very nicely. The numbers performrd by Andy Hallett and Christian Kane are surprising bonuses that I think fans of the show will appreciate.
3,"Creepy score,a couple of wonderful songs...","I know it's lame but I couldn't listen to the CD entirely because the score was so creepy,I might say frightening,so I skept to the real songs with voice and lyrics and it was very good exept for those Andy Hallett's songs.I know,he's funny,has a beautiful voice but I think it was better off stayed on the show.Anyway,touched by vast is one of my favorite and had a crush on the first time I heard it on the show,glad they chose it.LA song is really beautiful and Christian Kane can really sing.And my favorite of all,a place called home by kim richey which make me think of Fred,my favorite character from the show.A soundtrack for every Angel fans."
2,Vampire Muzak,"The music on the series was very effective and enjoyable, but being written in service to the story and visuals makes it a little unsatisfying with the music alone."
5,...its about time...,"...myself, and im sure all other fans had been patiently waiting for this cd to be released...the angel theme is cool , but i love #20 on the disk (its the true battle theme for angel ; like when angel took linsey's hand to get the scroll back."
3,Brooding Score for the Angel fan,"Like the score for Buffy tVS, what makes this music powerful for me is that I connect it with characters and narratives from the show. So good for fans but maybe not as accessible for non-fans."
3,TV-Music from Angel,"I am a HUGE Buffy and Angel fan, and have bought all the CDs and DVDs from the shows. This particular CD was not one of my favorites, however, it was enjoyable for the most part. It is a CD of symphony work, instrumental, very little vocal. I don't remember any of the songs from the show. But, if you are into symphony/instrumental music, I would recommend purchasing this, after it goes on sale."
2,Really Disappointed,"I wish I could have sampled the music before purchasing. Really disappointed because I wanted to be able to close my eyes and envision the ""Angel"" TV series regardless if it was instrumental or not...but it didn't -- it just wasn't the same. I really enjoyed the Buffy CDs and was hoping to experience the same joy with Angel's. But after the 2nd playing of it, it has been filed in the ""perhaps another day"" stack of CDs located in the Garage."
3,Hmm,"much more orchestral then I remember the show sounding, the music sounds different to me at least, when apart from the TV show.Not for me. Though I did enjoy Lorne's ""Lady marmalade"" and ""Its not easy being green"" ^^"
5,What you've been looking for,"For people who like that music they heard on that show that one time! This is mostly an orchestral score of the music from Angel. I personally liked Christophe Beck's music for Buffy better than Robert Kral's music for Angel, but it's still good. Also, I know a lot of people liked the song that Christian Kane sang in the episode ""Dead End"" called LA Song, but could not find it. Well, here it is! Plus a couple of excellent performances from Andy Hallett (Lorne) and an extended version of the main theme that I find preferable to the original.All in all, enjoyable and satisfying!"
3,Music to remember,"The opening track of the album by Darling Violetta, is absolutely fantastic. Having all the Buffy albums and knowing how thought provoking the music is from that show, I did expect more from the Angel album. But it's still good music and any fan would be happy to say they have it."
4,Randy's got the stuff!,"This individual is well versed in various styles. He's played with some excellent players in the industry, Barry White's bass player for one and the late great Joe Pass for another. He incorporated the various influences right here in this one cd. Studying with him for an unfortunately brief period, I'd discovered he had many more ideas waiting in the wings. Many of them are jazz/fusion oriented but here in this cd he has an eclectic mix of sounds. Very smooth and laid back to uptempo dancable, there's is rock, pop, light funk, RnB and also some middle eastern overtones. All this done with solid rhythm tracks. The instrumentation is all his own but the vocals, of course, he shares with his accomplice Lina. Very nice freshman project. I only wished I could have been around at the right time to record it with him. I certainly do recommend this one!!"
4,Folk for all times,"The hearty vocal harmonies of the trio is a very soothing style of music. I have enjoyed listening to this group since the '60s Their song ""Tom Dooley"" on the album is a classic for them and a great folk hit in general. If you havent listened to the band before, this best of album would be great. And for those who are fans like me, you gotta add it to the collection, I did!"
1,The cat broke it,"I bought this clock because I thought the alarm would be more difficult for my cat to turn off than the alarm on my old digital alarm clock. Instead, she knocked it off the nightstand, and the hands were never the same after that. It went back to Walmart the next day."
2,Too noisy for me!,"Living in a very quiet area, I find the ticking too loud. While it has an ascending alarm, it starts out too loud jarring me awake then gets just a bit louder and faster. The backlight is really edgelight with two LEDs one at numeral 4 and one at 10 that light when you touch the top button. It's plenty bright. The hands are luminous but not bright enough to see in the dark. Overall, an inexpensive alarm that does the job but proves that you get what you pay for."
2,Sharp analog alarm clocks,"Most Sharp analog alarm clocks use side lighting instead of backlighting. If you are nearsighted, as I am, the sidelighting is worthless at night.Sharp SPC830A Quartz Backlight Analog Alarm Clock (Black/White)"
3,"A little noisy , does the job","I bought this clock because my wife commandeered my other back-lit sharp alarm clock, and this was the closest I could come to replacing it. This one is a little noisy, especially when right by your head on a night stand. But not that bad. It arrived in unopened packaging but was broken. It took me all of two minutes to pop off the back, re-align the light bar/snooze bar, and get it working. The benefits of this clock are that it is large enough to easily operate the controls. The back light is really a side light at the 4 o'clock position, but it is adequate for double checking the alarm setting and seeing what time it is. From a sound sleep, you can either hit the snooze bar or disable the alarm without fumbling. It is keeping accurate time. Overall, it is a good value.Update: alarm now fails to go off at set time. After 5 years, I am shopping again."
1,Piece of junk,"Absolutely unreliable. It would alarm you at the wrong time sometimes, and not at all at others."
1,Not a reliable product,"I recently bought this clock, and I'm not happy with it at all.The alarm on mine barely, barely rings at all and is not nearly loud enough to wake someone up. It's a meek little beep that is about as loud as a whisper. The hand that determines what time the clock goes off is also not reliable - if you set the hand to around 7:15, the clock might go off at 7:00 or might go off at 7:30. I've had to resort to using my cell phone as an alarm after realizing that I couldn't count on this clock.Don't waste money on this piece of junk."
1,Not even worth the low price,"I bought two of these alarm clocks to replace a couple of lost and broken ones. My first impression upon unpacking them was that they were much larger than I expected (though to be fair, the measurements were provided in the description.)Second impression was that a hand was already broken off one of them, and on both, the knobs (for setting time and alarm) on the back were ... alarmingly... loose. The clocks rattled when shaken lightly.Within three weeks one of the hands fell off the second clock.While the alarm that I used for three weeks worked fine and seemed to have a good alarm and snooze system, it didn't keep time very well -- that hand was just waiting for its chance to drop off, I think.I really have nothing positive to say about these clocks. They were a waste of money. I'm surprised to notice the price has gone UP (!) since I bought mine-- I paid 9.99 apiece. I chose them because they were relatively inexpensive."
1,A picture is not worth a 1000 words,"Greatly disapointed ! On line the watch seems to be silver,in realitygold tone.I wouldn't have ordered. I wanted silver tone. In the descriptonof the watch it doesn't say tone of the watch."" Buyer Beware "" Richard Walsh, Bklyn. NY"
2,love style ...... hate quality,"looking for a travel mug that will fit in our car.. this one was ideal since the handle was attached high, loved not having to line it up and it was always tight fit.. but then it started leaking water from the bottom. the rubber bottom came off the bottom and the seam around the bottom is not sealed so if you put it in the sink (I don't have a dishwasher so can't say what it will do then) water seeps into the cup and then when you put it up-right it dribbles out.. on the counter, floor, your shirt, etc. Recommend spending a little more and getting one at Starbucks, they are guaranteed there..."
4,I've loved this book,I love this book and I'm still waiting for it to captivate our 2 year old. We've had it for a year and I'm holding on to this one for a while longer.
4,Cute book by a new author,"Adorable counting book with fun rhymes. Just the right length for nighty-night reading, with pleasantly rhythmic words. We're looking forward to new books by Ms. Schroeder."
5,This man can blow!,"A few months back I attended a Maceo Parker concert--a bad man in his own right--and was blown away by this guy, sitting on the side, a little too big to stand throughout the entire 3 hour concert. He sat in the background for a while and I didn't really notice him until he stood for a solo. Wow. He played the funkiest trombone I had ever heard, a combination of jazz and funk, a sound that got everyone to their feet. Who was this guy? It turned out to be none other than Mr. Wesley, the baddest trombone man alive. I later learned that he was also a band leader for James Brown before the two had a falling out. (Mr. Brown's loss)Fred Wesley is a creative genius--song writing and producing, yes, but most of all playing. All of his skills come through on ""Wuda Cuda Shuda."" The tracks combine jazz, funk, and a little hip-hop and introduce you to a side of the trombone I had never heard before. In short, this album is great."
5,review,"exceptional artists doing retro-cabaret stuff with a nod to Brecht and such. Well worth the listen. the music is original, the interpretations are spot on classical. If you can dig it you'll really dig it."
3,Changes,"I do not own this book, however, I do hold a series 7 license. I wanted to make buyers aware that the Series 66, and 65 have changed to much more difficult exams. Not to mention the material has somewhat changed. I would recommend trying to get new material that has these updates as well."
1,Try Robert Walker instead,"This book does little more than repeat the leagalastic jargon of the Uniform Securities Act and is simply not a very good study aid. I would highly recommend that you purchase Robert Walker's ""Pass the 63"" instead. It is well written using humor and actual ""English"" to explain the purposefully obscured language of the Uniform Securities Act. Malm's book merely repoduces that language. I honestly felt somewhat ripped off after I got this book and started reading it; so much so that conscience and ethics prevent me from re-selling it."
2,This book is out of date,I found this book to be very minimal and not up to date.There has to be better books out there.
3,Tough luck!,If you can't pass it on the first try your chances don't look good. I got an 80! U. Feel free to leave a feed back.
2,Quite Boring,Slow plot and not scary at all. I was expecting much more but it did not hold up at all.
4,natural goodness defined,"The New Whole Foods Encyclopedia is the holy grail to anyone embarking on a healthier, greener diet. Wood carries a relaxed, conversational tone through tales of sugar snap pea goodness or the brief history of quinoa, and I love her attention to detail in pointing out surreptitiously refined sugars in the most seemingly safest foods. At times, the lecture waxes a tad over-preachy, but the sheer breadth of foods covered, from South American grains to Asian legumes, makes this book a must-have for any cook."
5,One of the best Food resource books out there.,Thanks Rebecca your thorough research has helped to fill a void in my library.
3,Wasn't as good as expected,I think this wasn't the book that I was looking for. But its good for reference.
5,I don't know what this is!!!!,"So I look it up here. That's all. Sometimes in my travels ie ChinaTown. I find some very weird ingredients on the packages w/the few english words that is supposed to suffice us written for Americans. I'm grateful for this book, I found out some really good nutritional information on obscure seaweed that I had no clue was being used in pasta making in China. Image that, exactly what I needed for my thyroid gland. But best of all is the TCM and Ayurvedic info on these herbs & roots. Now I buy lotus root by the lb. But the best is correlating the info & giving my cooking a punch I never thought possible nor that I was capable of. I know that if it's something you put in your mouth, this book has got the goods on it. A must have in any kitchen witch's bookshelf."
5,Amazing!!!,I rcvd this book yesterday and spent most of my night reading through it - this is probably one of the most beautifully written encyclopedia's I have ever owned! Fantastic find!
5,Powerful!,"Fundamento Yoruba 1 is a powerful, agressive and earth shaking production in praise of the Orisa. I love the energy and hot temperment of the vocalist. There was a time music was not recorded on tapes or CD.. we must celebrate the library of percussion, styles and education we are provided through projects created by such artist as Papo Angarica ! Excellent!"
3,Nice book for beginning French students,"I used this book for my first two years of beginning French. It focused mainly on grammar and basic language. It had some French culture. It had a lot of cartoon pictures with the vocabulary which were helpful when learning new nouns. It's a little out of date, but other than that it's a fine book for beginning French students."
3,Consructive comments,The book did a nice job of demonstrating how much of paganism flowed into Christianity and that it lasted far longer and was much more vibrant than many might think. It confirmed much of what I already knew but also added nice touches along the way. It's easy to read but pictures would complimented and made the experience more fulfilling.
1,A dishonest and overrated scholar,"There are many disgraceful tales to tell about the early Christian communities and early imperial church, as one would expect. But MacMullen is not an honest scholar, and so one cannot tell the true stories from the false. He regularly misrepresents texts, using the impenetrability of his hilariously confused footnotes to hide his dishonesty. He assumes that none of his readers will think to go back to the originals to see if he is being honest (and he's probably right about that). Those of us who have studied the texts, however, know that this man is a disgrace to his profession, a person who violates every rule of scholarly integrity, and who simply, unambiguously, and shamelessly tells lies. What a pity he's taken seriously.Read Robin Lane Fox or E. R. Dodds, but skip this fraud."
2,BORING and ARROGANT,"While this is a very good, concise look in to Late Antiquity, the author writes in such a manner that he comes across as arrogant. I say this because he ""over does"" the way he writes. It is as if he wanted to impress the academic community with his eloquent language. What you really get is a difficult to read version of history. If this was not an assigned reading for my graduate course, I would have NEVER purchased this book! I read historical books all of the time, I think some historians forget that they WANT people to read their book. It's painful to read."
3,A sketchy overview of a complex subject,"MacMullen does a creditable job of covering several aspects of the transition from paganism to Christianity in the abstract. However the author is light on specifics. Granted, it is difficult to give a full and insightful summary of four hundred rather turbulent years of an empire encompassing three continents. Nevertheless, I was disappointed that most instances of persecution, toleration or assimilation are given in the abstract. Given the extensive and impressive bibliography, I am sure these are well-researched generalizations, but I found it hard to picture some of the concepts without specific examples. I consider this book a good primer for someone who wants to know where to begin studying the formation of the religion/culture called Christianity"
3,Real Grand Canyon stories,"I picked up this book when I was going out to see and hike the Grand Canyon. The book is much more interesting in context, i.e. you've seen and undertand the scale and the environment of the Grand Canyon. The book has a series of short vignettes, arranged roughly chronologically, about explorers, miners and assorted neer do wells that really gave life and reality to my experience hiking and exploring the Canyon. Each of the stories is concisely written and illustrated with period photos in B&W."
4,Worth your time,This would be a great book to read with a book club or a couple friends. The content makes for great conversation. It is also written in a way that makes reading easy.
4,HOW TO USE WEAPONS,"Okay, now that you've secured a stick, knife, or gun to defend yourself against that goblin crawling through the downstairs window, what do you do now? The intent of this book is to instruct the typical ignorant civilian in the emergency use of weapons. As you probably are aware, an automatic pistol or pump shotgun is of no use to an individual who has no idea how to load or operate it -- this book will tell you how. This book will also tell you the best knives to choose from your kitchen, and show why it's a bad idea to attempt to stab someone with a flimsy blade designed to slice bread or filet a fish. Perhaps this may be shorter than previous volumes, but it does exactly what it was intended to do -- TEACH."
3,Below Average Print Quality,"The source of this transfer is the old Blackhawk edition, possibly from 8mm, including Blackhawk's original opening titles. The transfer is passable, but very grainy. There may be a short scene or two missing, but I can't tell if they are missing from the original source, or this transfer. It looks like the projection speed is correct. The score, however, is simply needle-drop stuff, most often inappropriate. I just turned it off after awhile and used one of the generic scores I keep on file. The bonus short, ""Are Golfer's Cuckoo?"", is actually a better transfer, from a pristine source. The score, again, is needle-drop, but this time more listenable. So, until a better transfer comes along, these are the deficiencies we'll need to put up with."
2,"Unfulfilling, often frustrating diary of a for-hire skipper","Skipper Heutink clearly enjoys sailing, and occasionally enjoys his paying guests' company too, but he consistently fails to give us much to care about. I found this book frustrating because the author focuses on his infatuation with pretty girls (he's married and his son is his first mate), the daily trivia of mooring, cooking, and drinking, and how proud he is of his son and the trimaran he built. The prose is poorly edited and hard to parse, mostly due to Heutink's inconsistent nautical jargon, tendency to omit salient details, and failure to include maps with the names of places he visits. He's no storyteller; this is a fleshed-out (and mostly pretty dull) diary with no connective tissue. I learned nothing, and had more questions at the end than when I started the book."
3,Overall an OK book,"I mostly read non fiction sailing stories. Overall the book is good, but the author goes a little overboard with a negative attitude. I read it while on a sailing trip in the Inside Passage (Pacific NW) and left it on the boat. Normally, I read this type of book several times."
3,What a GREAT Adventure!,"For anyone planning to spend even some of their life living on the ocean this is a great read. Although he skips over places where more details would have been valuable, you cannot doubt the passion and love of sailing that Jerry shows in his book.As I'm planning a similar trip with my son, I could be a little biased here, but I'm sure there is enough material for a whole book in every leg of this long ocean voyage!Not a classic, but nonetheless an enjoyable personal insight into one man's great adventure."
4,A must for beginners !,"It's really difficult to find a good compilation and that one seems to be a good one! I don't buy this CD because I still have most of the tracks. But for begginers in bellydance and for people who wish to discover the different styles of the music from Middle East, it's a good choice."
2,Not enough variety for my liking,"I did not particularly enjoy this CD. I was looking for something with more variety and found there to be not enough of the gentler, more mysterious & earthy music that I personally enjoy listening to and dancing to."
2,Dreadful!,"The motivations and behaviors of most of the characters are either random or studid. You cannot make every character in a book crazy / disturbed / disfunctional! It would make no less sense to have any one of the suspects turn out to be the killer, based on a quick rewrite of a few paragraphs. That's not the way a mystery is supposed to work. Too many times, the heroine acts in a way that makes sense only because it will further complicate the plot. Surely no woman would have created this pathetic character. Probably the worst ""thriller"" I've ever actually finished (saving it from a 1 star rating)."
5,A master class in practical packaging,"I was drawn to this book originally for all of the fascinating stories it told about traditional Chinese medicine, but I became increasingly interested in what it had to say about different ways of packaging.Packaging, in its simplest expression, is little more than a wrapper. As shown throughout Hong Kong Apothecary, good packaging can deliver so much more - a brand promise, a visual guide to the product, a sense of the genuine.Regardless whether or not you ""believe"" in Chinese medicine or not, this book will reveal new ideas for how to deliver products of all sorts, and will give you a sense of how much more interesting packaging can be when its primary job is to tell a story.(It doesn't hurt that the book itself is beautifully designed!)For anyone who has wondered ""what's in all of those little drawers"" in the apothecaries featured in classic kung fu flicks, this should also be a big help."
5,a great reminder of the Great Commission,"What an incredible book this is! I started a small group for women in our church a few years ago, and God said it was time to ""get out of my comfort zone!"" This book was a nice reminder of of saying ""yes!"" to God each and every day and to not pass up an opportunity to share the truth with others. This book really helped to change my perspective and increase my compassion for the unsaved.This world is quite the battlefield, but with the power of God and the promise of Jesus, all things are possible.It's now being passed around the small group. And it is helping to seal the foundation of what we learned in the Way of the Master."
5,Witnessing Christ on the street,"We love Ray Comfort and his ministry with Curt Cameron called ""Way of the Master.""' Enjoyed reading about how Ray got to where he is now, he's fearless!'"
5,The Passions. Remarkable emotional roller coaster ride,"I owned this recording on vynel years ago but it was stolen. I have waited for years to find it again. Finally, out on CD. Yea!! Bass Shiva was a real talent and her work on this recording is extraordinary. Les Baxter was the master of mood music and this is one of his best works."
5,Excellent book!,Worked for my son who is now 2. We still use the same routine since he was 3 months old. Just bought this book again for my friend expecting!
5,a must buy book,II recommend this book to all expecting parents...it works . Just wish i got it before she was six months...5***** in my book
2,"Common sense, not worth an entire book",The book can be summed up in a few sentences...each day extend the space between feedings and pretty soon you will have enough hours so that the baby sleeps through the night. It is common sense...so not worth buying an entire book.
1,Does not work for us,"I started using this method with my son starting at four weeks when he was 11.5 lbs. He was eating 4 oz of breast milk or formula every three hours and waking up twice during the night. As soon as I had him stretch out the time between feedings during the day, he started waking up 4-5 times at night. He is now six weeks old and 13 lbs and we are trying to get him back to the way he was before. It seems that this book made things worse. I think it had to do with the fact that my son eats about 30 oz per day and will not eat more than 6 oz at a time when feeding are four hours apart. I'm not sure what I did wrong because I read this book five times and made sure that I followed every step. I may give it another try in a couple of months, but for now I don't think this method is for us."
1,Makes Me Sick,"Sleep training is such a disgusting idea. I bought a book about it and never needed it because I had enough sense to allow my baby to lead the way and I always follow his cues. He sleeps GREAT at night... no ignorance needed. If you choose to have a baby you better expect some sleepless nights. Trying to ""train"" your baby for your own selfish convenience is NOT a good idea. I hate that these authors try to make a buck by essentially telling you to let your child go hungry."
3,Good,Good book to have in mommies' library shelf. It helps with baby sleep problem. Recommended for every mom to try.
3,Good information but didn't work for me,"I read this book so many times that I practically memorized sections. It is well laid out and nicely explained. I was hopeful because it worked so well for my friends. As for baby and me, it was super stressful trying to do the day schedule. We were stuck here for weeks, we were both cranky and it didn't seem worth it. I was also breast feeding and couldn't sustain supply with the methods described. Baby is now 8 months and we finally got jhim to sleep through the night. More power to you of this book works for you!"
2,Not for Breastfeeding Moms,"The book is filled with lots of common sense advice and seemed to me like an easy plan to follow. It breaks down to giving your baby 4 feedings a day and night weaning. The main problem I had with the book is that it says to make sure your baby drinks 6 oz every 4 hours. I'm breastfeeding. I stretched my baby's feedings to every four hours and started to try an eliminate night feedings. The big problem came when my supply started dwindling because of this. There was no way to know how much my baby was drinking, and obviously not enough to keep my supply up with only four feedings a day. I went back to feeing on demand, and still working on night eliminating night feedings. My four month old now wakes only once at night. I'm okay with this. The book really isn't for someone who is breastfeeding. I'm sure if you are formula feeding the book works like a charm. Formula fed babies sleep through the night earlier than breastfed babies do... oh well."
1,Didn't really work for us,"This book was a very quick read and had some good ideas (so I thought). So, I started to use some of the ideas and my daughter's sleeping habits got worse and worse. The day I finally went back to feeding every 3 hours, she slept through the night the very next night. Huh."
4,It really works! Wish the book was longer.,"This book was amazing in that Giordano simply walks you through the steps to get your baby to sleep. My son is now 10 weeks old and is sleeping anywhere from 6 to 10 hours straight through the night. The first week was hell but it has all been worth it. My baby now no longer has any feedings in the night and only eats 4 times per day. I am currently working on getting him to take naps consistently in line with the book and get him through the full night every night. It is all about baby steps (no pun intended) and you have to be committed to make it work. I only wish that Giordano had put more info in the book about certain situations such as, ""what do you do when your baby won't sleep during the day?"" or ""how do you get your baby through the fussy times in the evening before bedtime?"""
1,Not as pictured,"This is not the same product in the picture and not the right description... its a newer version with different ingredients and needs to be updated. The version pictured is better, the one you get is junk."
2,A cornerstone to radical feminist thought,"Do I care for this text? No. Do I think its arguments are supported well? No. Do I think that it is worthy to be purchased? Certainly. The reason why this text should be purchased is because it is a cornerstone in the radical feminist debate raging over pornography. MacKinnon is bull-headed in this text (unlike she is in _Feminism Unmodified_ where she actually admits that women can and do enjoy sex... at times), but she is blatantly bull-headed. This text should be purchased if only to refute it, but it is worthy to be shelved on any bookcase that holds any texts of feminist theory. Does this book suck? Yes. Does it deserve one star? Certainly, but its impact grants it another star."
3,A believable Plot.,Though we know romance books always ends up with a happily ever after this one took the cake. Samantha or Sam as she is called has been best friend with Brad since she was fourteen years old. She never had any romantic feelings for him right? wrong. This is where the book takes a turn not expected. Brad becomes engage to a beautiful busty blonde and right away certain feelings started coming in Sam's mind. In the beginning she does not want to admit they are feelings of love. This book is not a typical romance book as i said before and readers will enjoy from it not been a typical romance storyline. I truly enjoyed it gave it 3 stars because it is romance after all and i had an idea of the plot before it ended. In the end a truly good read.
2,Not for the casual history buff,"Reading this book is not an easy undertaking. This is not an overview of the formation and acceptance of the Constitution, rather it is an in depth analysis of the goals and purposes behind its creation and those of its creators. A great effort was put into the writing of this book and my rating is based on my ability to absorb the information. It reads like a text book trying to appeal to a wider audience. In my case it did not achieve this goal. For a historian with the background to follow all the references I imagine it would be indispensible."
4,Difficult but interesting,"This is not incredibly light reading but Rakove's points are important. While many would have us believe that the original meanings of the Constitution can be grasped by reviewing the text of the Constitution, the Federalist Papers, and other important documents/statements, alas, it is not so easy. The Founders meant different things at different times and had different reasons for stating what they did at any given time. Does this mean that, because they said so many things, they actually meant nothing or anything? Of course not, however, it is not an easy task to understand them on the face of the written words - without also appreciating time, context, audience, etc. Oh well, so it goes."
3,hard book,"this book is not for students, but for academic faculty.it's so hard to read. and the book itself is not comfortable to watch. the paper is bad with easily broken equality and there are few grammer mistakesyou turned over 1 page, and you forgot what you just read. there are so much background and info you need to know.i should come to this book 10 years later."
5,the best,"have tried several shaving creams/lotions -- this is a uniquely dense formula that cushions better than anything I've ever used. No razor burn whatsoever, which is not the case w/others I've tried. Stays on your face even in a steamy shower."
1,Don't buy it!,"I am a user of a shaving brush and have tried many different brands of shave cream. This is by far the absolute WORST!! It doesn't lather well and the shave I get with this and a new blade is worse than canned shaving cream for $1.99. If you want a good quality lubricating shave cream, try the Jack Black shaving creamJack Black Supreme Cream Triple Cushion Shave Lather, it actually lubricates your beard for shaving and works well."
4,Helps children understand their parent's Hepatitis C,"When an adult gets Hepatitis C, the symptoms are often vague. Tiredness, irritability, and mood changes are more difficult to explain than something concrete and visible like a broken leg. Sometimes the treatments make the parent more depressed. In the absence of good understanding, the child may blame herself or her parent.This book describes a young girl whose mother has Hepatitis C. The story is clear and straightforward. It does a good job of explaining the illness and showing that the mother loves her child even when she is feeling ill. However, the plot is fairly plain, and the characters do not come alive.I have recommended this book to mothers and fathers who are dealing with hepatitis C."
4,Nice independent release.,"This is like old school 80's metal.The singer sounds a lot the the guy from The Cult,and the music is like Stryper and Dokken.If you can find this Cheap,it's a fun listen!!"
3,"Rehash of other books, nothing new....",I am a Princess Diana book and memorabilia collector. This book was less informative than I'd hoped. It was a bit of a rehash of other similar picture books but it was in good condition and the price was nice. Shipped quickly and is an addition to my collection.
4,Interesting book,"I had expected this book to have more photographs of the late princess, but I am discovering as Islowly read the book, more about the Princess than perhaps many of the memoirs I have read.I really had never paid much attention to the princess until the local television stationin the area where I grew up, interrupted --- rudely, I thought at the time --- with the announcementthat the princess had been killed in that horrible accident.From that day on, I became hooked on reading more and more --- some repetitious material --- andI am still searching for new material all the time about Princess Diana.I like this book as there is information that I might not have read, had I not ordered thisparticular book.And I must say, that because of my late interest in the princess, I suddenly found myselfglued to the television earlier this year watching as William, i.e., Wills and Kate, weremarried. I hope theirs will be a long and happy marriage."
3,A ten-pound fluff piece,"This book is a horrendous compilation of lengthy quotes--unedited, clearly-slapped on the diaphanous narrative. And it's a shame, really, that her Trust spun this as a testament to her essence. I hope they can come up with something better for the 20th commemorative edition. Don't get me wrong, I did like the pictures in the book. And I certainly understand the value of direct quotations--it's the abuse of that support for one's thesis that I despise. I also despise how, aside from her father and brother, men are removed from this book. The writing on Prince Charles would cover less than 1/2 a page; Dodi, a sentence. Her extramarital affairs receive scant mention. These huge influences, in life and in death, are simply too important to airbrush. If you want to spin Diana as human, then stick to the plan."
2,Poor Design & Performance,"I have had other Brother fax machines, but this one I put back in the box and in our storage room after 12 days. I was so unhappy that I called Brother to come out and please fix this machine. Brother came to my office and tried to fix the problem twice. Finally they gave me another machine to try. This one was even worse. Brother then tried to fix the second machine (same model) but failed. It seems that the interior rollers that pull the pages through to be faxed have to be adjusted so accurately, so as to pull the paper through straight. The faxed sheet (that is received at the other end) is twisted and longer than the origional. This is unacceptable when faxing die drawings and other related small drawings. For contracts and proposal letters, the faxed sheet looks very unprofessional. This model is only good for occasional family faxing."
2,"""Requires Decorator Preferred Heating Core, sold separately.""","I have not yet used this product, so my 2 star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the product (since I am unable to rate it that way yet). But imagine my surprise when my shipment arrives, and I find that the paper insert in the cake pan states ""Requires Decorator Preferred Heating Core, sold separately."" Nowhere in the item description did it state that when I purchased this item, otherwise I would have ordered one then!! Now I have to wait for yet another order to arrive before I can use this... AND pay for extra shipping. Fabulous. Thanks a lot, Amazon.com!"
5,Excellent Pan Series from Wilton,"I have many pans from the Decorator Preferred collection and they are excellent. The construction is heavyweight aluminum, the cakes bake evenly and release quickly from the pan. I prefer this series for the precise construction of the pans. You do need the Wilton Heat Core, which is sold separately on Amazon.Wilton Decorative Preferred Heating Core Bakeware"
4,Entertaining and very engrossing work all the way,"Cityscape really takes Open Game Content to a new whole new level with a really cool variety of races, the art is occasionally uneven but I loved the cover.When I think of Cityscape, I think of the works of Philip Jose Farmer crossed with Philip K. Dick crossed with a run of Marvel Comics.It's not perfect, then again what in the world really is, but it does really pull you in and it turns out to be surprisingly engrossing if you give it half a chanche.I would recommend Cityscape."
5,Great fun for all ages!,"I recently bought the Doodle Pro for my 2 1/2 year old and she LOVES it. She plays with it endlessly. Her favorite part is the shape 'stampers', though she does enjoy doodling with the pen (and asking Mommy to write her name and draw Elmo for her). I must say, I was having fun with it as well. ;-) Such an improvement over those cardboard-and-plastic-sheet doodle things we had 25 years ago!I can't say anything about the durability, as she's only had it for a short while. I'm hoping it stands the test of time, but even if it doesn't, it's not too expensive to replace every so often.My only gripe is the string that holds the pen on. It's a little on the short side and if it gets caught around the corner or back of the toy . . . ""Mommy! Stuck! Stuck!"" is all I hear until I go 'rescue' her pen. I'm tempted to cut it off the string and just hope she doesn't lose it. I suppose an older child, who could free the sting themselves, would have no issue with it."
5,Fantastic toy!,My 2 year old adores this toy. She sits and plays with it for long stretches of time and I'm amazed at how it has improved her drawing and writing capability. It is more manageable than paper and writing implement and portable and there is no mess involved. Her drawing skills have really blossomed.
4,Great fun - Great Value,Great price - kids love it. Not sure it is highly educational but my kids love to draw on it. We now have three one for each kid to avoid fights. The only downside is there is a small portion of the screen on two of them that are not pure white but have a gray tinge. It is not a major problem but is noticeable. My guess it connects to ok but not great construction quality.
4,Great!,"My cats love this. The moving water actually helps cool it off which my cats prefer. Since buying it 8 months ago, both of my cats have ceased drinking from the toilet bowl after I flush it (they love that cool, moving water). Yes, it accumlates fur, but as long as you clean it thoroughly once a week (takes 5-10 minutes), everything is fine. The motor is incredibly quiet if you have the item assembled properly . After taking it apart and putting it back together, sometimes you have to do it again if it is noisy. Not a big deal since THE CATS LOVE IT!The only complaint I have is that the charcoal filter is AFTER the motor... so it doesn't filter out any fur or other gunk from the motor.... which is why you have to disassemble the motor (VERY easy) in your cleaning process once a week."
4,...8 second's to load,"...the load time on this equipment is 8 seconds only,...I have had this now for 2 years and have never had any issues...superbly built"
2,BEWARE - 30 second cd load time.,"If you plan on using your unit for real gigs, BEWARE. It takes at least 30 seconds from the moment the deck accepts your cd to the moment you can actually start cueing it up. NOT GOOD.I have 2 of these but they've been relegated to weddings because they look amazing and attract a lot of attention. But that's it.If you run into problems, good luck on getting technical support. I've had to learn to deal with one of my units randomly skipping across cd's because the certified technicians were never able to duplicate or find root cause.Oh, and check out what your local bars and clubs are using because I guarantee you it's not the sl-dz1200."
5,Bravo!,This CD/DVD set are reflections of exactly what fans of Solas love about the group. If you like high energy Irish music you will not be disapointed!
2,Fails to penetrate my belief system.,"I don't understand why so many readers are excited over this tedious series. But I suppose at the time this came out Deathlands had not emerged yet, nor TechWars. But ""The Last Rangers"" did come out around this time, and is a far better series. TLR is superior to TNW in delivery of action sooner, and in the dry satirical asides its descriptive prose illustrates. TNW's prose is bland and static. I could get more interesting descriptive prose reading a Sears catalogue. Read Deathlands, Outlanders and The Las Rangers for the best in satirical humor and action."
2,Boo,"I'm normally a big bun head, but the writing on this show is super hokey... Many of the situations (and even performances) would not happen at a real school of that caliber...but hey, it's teeny bopper tv..."
4,watch,"Nice looking with what seems to be a very durable strap.The strap is long, so I had to cut it with a blade so it did not stick out as far.Easy to set up.Do not like the timer as it gives too many beeps when getting to the 5 minute mark, otherwise had everything that I wanted including a 30 databank for phone numbers when I do not have my cell phone."
2,Uncomfortable!,"Well, for those of you who like the 80's style discomfort of a rigid rubber wristband and no hope of adjustment, this is the watch for you. The band, regardless of position is terribly uncomfortable, either sliding around your wrist or biting into your skin. The way it is attached makes it nearly impossible (I haven't found one) to replace.The vibration is decent, but if you're a heavy sleeper it probably won't be strong enough. I'm not sure, because it is too uncomfortable to wear to bed! It is extermely water resistant and held up to salt-water snorkeling quite nicely. The numbers are clearly visible, however the backlight should have s feature where it stays on for more than a second, like the features that Timex has.I would suggest that you pass on this product and try to find something else."
5,Cute Tot Shoe,I loved this for my son's first walking shoe. I just purchased his second pair and I am a little sad to put these away. Stride Rite is a great shoe and this is a great price!
5,One of the best movies in years,"What a remarkable surprise! This film gives the viewer a strong experience--and so a first-hand understanding--of the incredibly subtle and profound topic it addresses. Watching it I felt confused, disoriented, annoyed, fascinated, intrigued, and ultimately awed by the way it wove in the loose ends for the finale. No details were overlooked. The highest praise I can give is that I have felt compelled to watch this movie several times, and have gotten more from it every time. It is a delightful and gentle work of art that will work in the back of your mind long afterward."
2,"Off-beat, but poorly done","This movie does have a refreshing philosophical perspective, but it's not executed well. A lot of the dialogue is plodding or obvious. The characters have no chemistry, relationship twists seem surreal, and the waste and extravagance is enormous for so called ""enlightened"" souls.The movie is too long and repetitive and ultimately predictable."
5,from a mario party advance owner: mario is PORTABLE!!!!!!!!!,"this game is awesome! my family adverstises for nintendo and my dad recently send me a copy of the mario party advance and i gotta say this is better than i thogth it'd be. I been playing lately and i'm really impressed with it. the minigames are really fun, they came with great ideas for this game's minigames.the graphics are awesome!!!!!!. the sound is pretty cool too. they have mixed some of the old mario songs. believe, this is one of the best games for the GBA. Wait until dec. 6 and you see what i mean. Hope this helped you make your desicion!"
4,Great game,"I would rate this game the third best in the Mario Party series, behind 4 and 3, respectively. This game has its own personality in that you have to move around the board and solve quests to get gaddgets. I like that you have to excel at mini-games to continue on your quests. I would say this game is quite easy, but that's what makes it so fun."
3,Somewhere in between,"Mario Party advance can be fun at times yet mostly annoying.Theres a whole bunch of unlockables called ""gaddgets"" that can be gained by completing quests.However if you run out of mushrooms(turns)your game is over.Gamplay wise this mario party is drastically different from before. The gaddgets are simple yet fun diversions,they can be found in shroom city (story mode)or bought with coins.In my opinion mini games are poorly explained,it doesn't give any extra tips to win,and the initial instruction could have been more concise.I do like how you can control where you go more e.g you could go backwards if you didn't mean to go down that path in particular.All in all Mario Party advance is pretty good yet it could be tweaked a bit more.Pros-Plenty of unlockables-Good music (some from Mario Party 4)Cons-Poorly explained instuctions-Annoying at times"
4,It is a little bit disappointing,"I like to play for fun but that this game seems to me more like work. I would enjoy it much more if I wouldn't have to worry about running out of stars that allow me to move around. However, if you are a good player (I'm an occasional player) and have no trouble with passing little games that allow you to collect stars, then this game might be fun for you."
1,The worst Mario Party game!,"Let's face it, all Mario Parties stink, but this is just plain horrible. It's probably the second worst Mario game ever. The graphics and sound are a pain to look at or listen to. No good gameplay means no replay value. In fact, there's nothing good about this game at all when you think about it. I rate this game 19/100."
1,BOOOOOOOO!,"IF YOU ENJOY MARIO PARTY GAMES LIKE ME DON'T GET THIS.IT STINKS!HERE ARE THREE REASONS WHY I HATE IT.1.YOU CAN ONLY PLAY AS MARIO,LUIGI,PEACH AND YOSHI!2.NO STARS.IT'S MISSIONS THAT ARE SOOOO ANNOYING!3.LACK OF OF MINIGAMES.YES,THE MINIGAMES AND GADGETS ARE FUN BUT,THERE ISN'T ENOUGH TO KEEP ME OCCUPIED."
3,Mario Party Advance,"What a great game, the plot is similar to the second Mario Party game. I still haven't figure out some of the the mini-games, just like in all the Mario Party games. The only draw back I can think of is that you get to choose from four characters instead of six. This game left out Wario and Donkey Kong, but other than that it is a great game! I would recommend this to anyone that has a Gameboy Advance or is a fan of the Mario Party games."
2,Nothing like the fun Mario Party games for N64 and Gamecube,"I was very disappointed when I first played this game. I am a huge fan of Mario Party 1-6, and even got my Gamecube so I could continue getting them. Mario Party Advance is nothing like any of them. The mini games are difficult with the gameboy and there is no real board game where you try to get the star. Those missions are really dumb. For more entertainment, get any of the gameboy Harvest Moons. At least they held my attention for longer than ten minutes."
5,excellent,"Works great,had no problems with it.Alot better then counting flashes...lol Has all the codes listed in the book for easy code retrieval. Have a 1993 Ford Aerostar Eddie Bauer, found out it needed an o2 sensor and a mass airflow sensor."
5,Ford code tester works great.,I got the tester to find out why the check engine light was staying on on my 1995 Ford F-150. It worked very well and the digital display is much easier than counting light flashes. The directions were clear and it was a snap to use. I recommend it to any backyard or part time mechanic that may work on a older model Ford.
