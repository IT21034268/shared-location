1,"Voice of a former ""Angel""","Charlotte Church has produced an average pop CD. Her voice, when singing her previous classical repertoire, was sublime. With her smoking and attempt at a ""rock"" sound, she is wasting her talents and ruining her voice. Listen to her earlier CDs and you will understand."
2,SORRY CHARLOTTE - Even God can't change my view on this album . . .,"I bought this CD, expecting it to be somewhat easy to listen to. I was wrong! The whole album is a waste of money! Every track is completely over-produced with terrible synthetic pop sounds and heavy background vocals. I am warning you - DON'T BUY THIS! I'm not going to write a long and dragged-out review about this album, with scores and comments. Her voice has taken a nose-dive. It's WAY to breathy and weak. Please - After Charlotte's recent behavior against the Catholic church and her use of language, cigarettes, and alcohol, all you're going to do is put more money in her pocket to keep doing these things."
1,Yech....,"Guess it's because I'm over 60, and my daughter is just a bit older than Charlotte, I've been following her career since she turned up on the local PBS channel's pledge drive.Mostly a lot of ""look at how much money that girl's making""... :)However, I liked her style of music. Not all of it, but much of it. If you examine ""Prelude"", it almost matches a compilation I made up myself from all of the audio CD's I have.This time around, though, there was nothing on the CD I cared to hear.... I suppose if I was a lot younger....She's still cute, at least."
1,when angels turn to rebels,"I dont have any of her albums but ive heard a few of her songs, and they were good stuff. But this record? its like a strickly religous person denouncing their faith and turning into the complete opposite. This record sounds way too britney spears-like. if your doing good with a particular genre, STICK WITH IT, and dont change for no one just to raise your ego cause then you start losing fans big time!"
1,Run of the Mill....,"One of the reviews used the term ""Run of the Mill"" and I can't think of a better description. At one time Charlotte stood out from the pack as a truly great singer; unique and fresh, but now she just blends into the middle. Just another sound-alike voice; vanilla. No distinct color, no distinct flavor. Mark Twain once mused over how many times we chase after things we were never meant to do instead of embracing and using the talents we were born with. This couldn't be MORE apparent in Charlotte Chruch's case. In her wiser youthful age she had high goals of becoming a great opera star. We her buying and adoring audience waited breath abated and in full support. She seems to have traded those aspirations in for a self-destructive path, both personally and professionally, of going for, and missing the mark, of a pop singer; nothing great; not even ordinary. One of the reasons she's so disappointing is we know what she could have been. What a waste."
2,Over ambitious and lacking substance...,"...The basic problem with this album is that it sets itself up to be a battle scarred, well rounded, emotional journey and it just isn't. Miss Church has a beautiful voice, no one can doubt that, but what she doesn't have is the experience, either musical or personal; to produce a reinvention album from a pop Diva. She is only 19 for goodness sake! This said she demonstrates some of the makings of a good transition from the classical world to the world of pop, but she a lot to learn such as Rich, brattish 19 year old girls don't have the kind of ""issues"" the world is clammering to hear about."
2,Charlotte Church,Ms Church definitely experimenting on this album- did not like it. In fact would not have recognised her voice if I didn't know it was her. Voice is different on each song- talk about multiple personalities.
4,"I dunno call me a ""Crazy Chick"" too...",But I actually love this cd.. Well I only have a cd single import that has Call my name and Let me love you on it. I am wanting to hear more. I LOVE the classical side to Charlotte but this experimentation with new styles is rather refreshing. She has grown up and that's hard for some people to grasp. I love it though.
1,AWFUL!,"I absolutely love Charlotte Church's voice, but I couldn't stand even 1 song on this CD. She's lowered herself to a ""Brittany Spears-wanna-be.""Monotone songs, horrible bass, every song sounds the same. I am extremely disappointed in this collection of music.Buy this one and you're just wasting your money.Would the REAL Charlotte Church please come back?????"
1,Why Charlotte??,"Charlotte Church has such a beautiful voice, & it's sad to see her sink to this.I'm not against her doing pop, but couldn't she have done good pop instead of this drivel? I don't know why she has allowed her voice to be drowned out & disguised on this massively overproduced album. Basically, it could be anyone singing."
2,Awfull!,"Charlotte.... oh God! what a change!!! that's pretty sad. I didn't liked this album, just one tune... the one of Even God.... but i hope youll g√©t back to sing like an angel"
1,what the...,Is this the same Charlotte Church who at the tender age of 12 or 13 had the most beautiful voice in the world? Boy she's changed!
1,WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED TO CHARLOTTE CHURCH?!?!?,"This cd was recorded by Charlotte Church?!?!? This album is defintely not her best work. Oh my God, I can't believe she trashed her beautiful songs. Well, she is growing up. We can't expect her to be the litte girl we once knew. She was amazing when she was young, but now she's changed. Everything has changed, including her music. BOOOOO!!!! Because of this album, it made my younger grandchildren cry--they admired her. Charlotte, you lost your touch. I'm sorry to say it, but it's true. Just give up. It's over."
3,Tissues and Issues Review,I like this album alot. The songs are catchy. Most certainly a change for Charlotte Church.
5,Charlotte's search,"I like this CD, Charlotte's proven she has a beautiful voice that can please even the most discrimitive classic music sod.Why so many base musical talent on complexity, I'll never understand. The beauty of any art is that even the simplest of work can be wonderful. This CD is no different. If it catches your ear, gets to your soul and makes you feel emotions, then in my opinion, the artist has succeeded.Charlotte's young, beautiful and full of ideas, her future work will most certainly be exciting.Cheers"
3,"If you like pop, here it is...","She definitely wants to exterminate her pretty image and beautiful voice for some popish sounds. Now some of the songs are pretty catchy and I was into the cd for about a month, but after I rarely even thought about or wanted to listen to it. I had to buy this from Amazon to import to the U.S...don't think it was worth the money b/c you can listen to her ""hits"" on youtube. Funny thing, when I first started getting into Charlotte Church she was asked ""Would you ever consider any alternative genres of music, like Pop?""...her response ""My voice is for more mature music and I'll let other singers create pop music"" or something along those lines..."
1,horrible,"what has happened to Charlotte Church? i can understand growing up and changing but this is insane. she totally changed herself - she looks like a hooker and her voice ugh she's totally wrecked it. she doesn't sing anything classical, opera, or hymns, or anything like that. i really don't know what to call the juck she is singing. i'm very dissipointed and deeply saddened"
3,Symphonic Dances Felix Slatkin,"Clean sound but somehow lacks body, sounding lightweight, no real dynamic punch. Performances OK, but the Gaite Parisienne lacking dynamics, no comparison to the superb Fiedler Boston pops release, especially on the remastered hybrid release from RCA."
5,Every software tester should read this book!,"This book is a very comprehensive guide to software testing on the mainframe. It would be beneficial for both experienced testers and those new to the testing profession. The authors have done a great job of describing the tasks facing software testers, and the unique (and important) role that the test process plays in delivering world-class software. The book is very readable--it covers a lot of important information in a straightforward manner. You can't test quality into a software product, and you can never find EVERY bug. This book helps place the focus on what's really important--finding the defects that matter!"
5,A great toy,The readon its educational is because it not just a figureits a model with pieces that are numbered so it some what educational since you have to put it togather plus it just like the electronic figures the same material is used so its not verey easily broken and it has great detail and a huge taleits says its thirteen inches tall but the figure is a little smaller than that the wing span makes up for about four inches
4,"Great Fun and Educational, Low Durability","My girls, 3 and 18 months, have honed their patience, fine motor, and teamwork skills with this wonderful toy. I've taught them how to take turns adding blocks to their tower and how to take turns knocking it down (this took a little while!). Never the less they play with it all the time. Great for me as we're having our third and any toy that they can play with together is a bonus. My only problem with it is it's durability as the blocks are made out of cardboard and won't stand up to rough play or being stepped on (as my 3 year old likes to do). Also, it won't teach your children the alphabet but it is good exposure. All and all though this is a great toy."
4,"lots of fun, my son loves it!","My son loves stacking and nesting the blocks, he especially likes to build the tower then knock it down. The product is more durable than I thought it'd be, its great!"
3,Colorful and fun toy but poor quality!!,Its a colorful cardboard stacking blocks with pictures and alphabets written in uppercase. And my son loves to stack blocks. And thats why i bought it but i am a little disappointed for a couple of reasonsmainly with the quality! its not durable. my son saw a lose end in one of the blocks and he pulled it and tore it!!Secondly its too cluttered. It would make this toy more appealing if they could put just one picture for each alphabet!!
2,Poor quality...,"I know this is not an expensive toy, but the quality is too poor. The designs are wonderful, immediately captivated my child, but the glued on paper has ripples and the edges are not quite matching. They also started to fray/shred along the edges immediately - I mean within the first 10 minutes. I wanted cardboard boxes instead of wood as they are not as heavy, but I didn't know that meant the design is printed on paper and glued on. I had seen other maker's cardboard nesting blocks that are much higher quality (no glued on paper) and I should have paid more to have that type. I wasn't able to discern that from the product description - lesson learned."
4,My girls loved these blocks,"These blocks are perfect for a 1-2 year old. They are brightly colored, lightweight, easy to stack and they stack up tall and knock over easily - all key elements of fun for a toddler. Both my daughters enjoyed them and I have given several sets as first birthday gifts. Because they are made of cardboard, they aren't terribly durable and we've probably gone through 3 sets at my house as some of the blocks get stepped on or sat on by accident and crushed. Considering the relatively low price, I haven't minded replacing them and expect to get a new set for for my third baby when he is ready for stacking fun."
5,Fun Birthday Present,"I purchased this toy for a one year old's birthday present. At the party, kids from age 1-5 were playing with it, and they were all having a blast!!"
3,Broken within an hour!,We LOVE Melissa & Doug products.. In fact I try to order 2-5 a month for my 2 year old. I was VERY sad when this item came and within an hour was broken. NOT DURABLE AT ALL.. I have never ever had any issues with any of their other products so hopefully it was just a fluke.
3,seems terrific but could be better!,"this toy was a big hit with my 18-month old twins, but unfortunately it didn't take them long to destroy it. the images are very cute and clever and we enjoyed stacking and nesting the boxes but they couldn't stand up to my children trying to stand on them. they did have fun with it until they crushed the boxes, though!"
4,Building blocks Alpha stacker,"The stacker is made of cardboard. Somehow, we thought they would be plastic. The cardboard is stiff, but can get the corners torn with little ones picking at it."
4,Great but easily destroyed,This is my second set. My son loves it so I had to buy another one. He stepped on the boxes and the bottoms came out. I taped them back on but it was long before he broke them again. He likes to put his feet in the boxes and walk around in them. Super cute but these are cardboard so it doesn't last the beating. After most the boxes were destroyed I threw them away and bought a new set. The new one he seems to be treating better as I have only taped 3 of them and its holding up. He loves stacking them and knocking them down as well. Would like this better if they were cheaper!! I also considered buying the wood ones but the cardboards are better for now as I do not want him to hurt himself on wooden ones.
3,cardboard is not last forever...good for a few months,"it keep my toddler girl busy and happy but the material is not good period! one cube brock and the others has cuts,scratchers and the paper coming out-its been less than two months..."
4,Fun product,I bought these blocks for my 2 year old daughter and she really enjoys stacking them and then nesting them. The blocks are made of a coated cardboard and are open on the bottom. They aren't the most sturdy and tend to fall when stacked if not placed exactly in the correct place. But the pictures on each block are great and overall I am happy with purchase.
4,"Pretty, but flimsy and made of cardboard","Length:: 0:50 MinsThe first thing you should know about these blocks, which you may already if you're more observant than me, is that they are made of cardboard. I bought these for my 10 month old as she seems to be nearing the 'stacking' phase and I thought they'd be fun. Unfortunately, she's still in the 'puts everything in her mouth' phase, too, and has gone to town sucking on the edges of the smallest block. These do not hold up well for a sucking baby.If your child is a bit older and not privy to sucking on things, these will probably last a bit longer although I'm guessing not forever. They are pretty and fun to look at with lots of alphabet themed colorful designs. They stack nicely, and provide a fun physical challenge for a child.If you want something lightweight, totally non-dangerous, and cheap, these are great stacking blocks and will be loved by careful children. If you want something sturdy for a younger child, these are not it."
4,Toddlers Delight,"My toddler daughter loves these blocks I purchased as a Xmas gift. She plays with them everyday for at least 3 hours, which frees me up and I love that! The pictures are rich in color and the letters are easy to read. When play time is over the blocks nest inside each other making them great to stow away in her toy box or on a shelf without loosing any in the process. These blocks can take a licken and keep on ticken too! Very sturdy and tons of fun."
3,Cute but cardboard,I guess I didn't read enough of the decription. These aree so adorable and bright and educational. I am just worried they won't last long around my two year old. They nest inside each other for storage but are constructed out of thin cardboard. I am hoping they hold up. My little ones seem to be very attracted to them though.
3,"Concept is great, but poor material selection","I saw this at a local kids museum and thought it was a great toy, so we bought it for our son. It's a great toy in concept, but I would not buy this for a child under the age of perhaps 4 or 5 since it is made of cardboard. My son is 16 months old, and he loves to play with it, but he chews on the cubes which of course damages them. Also, the cubes crush easily. We have several cubes now with no 5th side mainly due to me accidentally stepping on them while picking up the playroom!"
2,Not Durable,"Cardboard toy with a toddler NOT...I thought it would be more sturdier. My daughter had a good time after one use, but by the secnd use I was picking up pieces of cardboard. My daughter wanted to sit on them, knock them over, and do all things most toddler do with toys. I had to toss one block already. I would highly recommend that someone purchase this sort of toy in plastic. That way it's more durable and easy to clean if needed."
2,Horrible quality!!,"The first day we had these blocks, my 16 month old was playing with them and one of the blocks top caved in. We have had to throw them away, because they're all broken. He's not super rough on his toys...he uses them like a normal toddler boy! We have the Baby Einstein nesting blocks at his grandparents house, and he has had NO problem with them. They're all perfectly intact. I'd suggest buying them instead."
3,Stacking blocks,"These blocks are very cute, and my daughter loves playing with them. She is learning to stack and build. However, they are just made of cardboard and so they aren't very durable. We've only had them a few weeks and already one of them is ripped along the edge, and she has also chewed off a couple of corners. So if you're wanting a toy that will last through multiple children this is probably not it. They are cute though, and not a bad price,"
3,Cute but sort of flimsy,"These are not as sturdy as I'd hoped. The rigidity is comparable to a high-end matte shoe box - I think a really rough toddler could easily destroy them. They would never survive being accidentally stepped on by an adult, either. So far, however, they are holding up ok. The colors and designs are very vibrant. My 2 year old enjoys them on occasion, but moves on quickly."
3,Almost a great toy....,"I never would have bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas if I had known that it was made out of paper. I thought it would be either wood or plastic. It is actually material similar to a shoe box. As soon as my daughter (17 months) opened it on Christmas morning, she sank her teeth right into it. I guess we'll have to put it away until she is past her chewing phase. Also, I wish that these blocks had a little ""lip"" on the bottom that enabled the blocks to nestle on top of each other when they are stacked. Instead, they just stack loosely and unsecurely. If the product had been more expensive, I would have returned it, but it was cheap enough that it wasn't worth paying for return postage. I expected more from a Melissa and Doug product. I have many other products from them that I am very happy with. This one was such a let down."
4,Big hit,"Literally. My girls (and my husband) love building towers and then knocking them down. My 3 year old loves to find patterns in which sides she lines up. I do wish it was made of something a little sturdier than cardboard, but then it might be too heavy, so it's a fine compromise."
5,One of my Melissa and Doug Favs!,"I can't say enough about these nesting blocks. I love Melissa and Doug products and I have owned one of these for years. This particular one I bought was for my 1 year old nephew. My now 3 year old got it when she was one and it has survived her and my now 1 1/2 year old. They both love to play with this still. It's sturdy and colorful. Great for nesting, stacking, discussing the alphabet or the animals on them, comparing sizes, and more. Great learning tool (as usual with M&D) and I would definitely recommend this."
2,"Great toy, but not for rough little boys","My two and a half year old son loved these blocks and spent time everyday stacking, nesting, and reciting the letters and animals. For that, I would give it 5 stars. Sadly, I have to give it 2 stars because he figured out within 2 weeks how to rip apart the boxes, and I had to throw out every flattened block. These would be great for an older kid or a gentler child ;) If they made them in a durable plastic I would definitely buy them again."
4,Great Blocks with Wonderful Graphics,"These blocks very colorful and keep my daughters attention with the funny graphics. They are very well made, but I still wonder why blocks like this are made of cardboard. That is the only reason I gave them a 4 and not a 5. I have a feeling if my daughter were to step on them, they would get crushed."
2,Cardboard,"I bought this without looking closely because I have been very pleased with other Melissa & Doug items, but this was a huge disappointment, as the blocks are made of cardboard. My daughter chewed and sucked on them almost from the very start, and there are holes in some of the corners.Now that she is almost 3, she will still sometimes play with them, however for the age group that they are intended, cardboard is a poor material choice. I am buying the wooden set for my nephew for Christmas this year.....much more appropriate and durable."
1,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to these, but was very disappointed for a Melissa & Doug toy. The quality is not great, especially if your child likes to chew things... they disintegrate quickly. Mostly though, I was very disappointed by the colors on the outside of each block. The top of every block (which you spend the most time looking at) is a star in the middle of a series of black squares. Not at all appealing. Each box has letters with drawings, but the drawings aren't very accurate... would you expect a lion to be lying on its back turning on a light bulb..? My daughter, who talks to almost all of her toys, was not interested in this at all (once she chewed through the corner of one box)."
2,Does not last long; not durable,These blocks are made out of cardboard. They didn't last more than a couple months with my kids before they started falling apart. My two year old occasionally sucked on the blocks and now they're not looking pretty sad.
1,This are cheap?,"Purchased these ""Blocks"" with the intention of having my 18 month-old being able to play with them; kinda what kids are supposed to do with blocks. However, these are cardboard boxes, not blocks! They should never use the word blocks; they are so cheap and can get damaged very easily. Don't buy these, they are a total rip off."
2,REALLY?!!! Come on?!,"Ok. Let me start by saying I LOVE Melissa and Doug products! We have spent literally thousands of dollars on them! Its crazy! I have never had a bad thing to say!I will still purchase this brand. Matter of fact I have two things in transit currently to be delivered.These blocks are worthless! I received them late. They were damaged. They do not stack even. The ONLY redeeming quality was the box it came in. The kids thought it was fun to carry it around. We also have the wooden animal stacking blocks. They are GREAT! We love them! So I am not sure what happened with these? They usually make GREAT stuff! These are a total waste of $!!! Again, it will not keep me from purchasing this brand but unless it is made of wood I will stay away from it totally!"
4,Surprisingly entertaining!,"I was skeptical at first, but my toddler loves these! We stack them (and then knock them over), and nest them, and I am amazed at how much she studies these - she looks for the stars, and the squares, and she tries to figure out what each character is doing (the bunny is smelling the flower, the cow is blowing out the candles, the bear is putting on his boots, the lion is going nite-nite, etc.). I think she could probably destroy these if she wanted to, and if I let her - I've had to stop her from trying to step inside the boxes a few times, but overall, these are a great toy!"
4,Fun but not the most durable,"My two year old daughter thinks these are really fun and loves the pictures and letters on the blocks. The only problem is that they are not the most sturdy and will most likely not last a real long time, but for the price I think they were a good purchase. Very cute and kids do love to build towers!"
3,A good buy,"It is a lovely toy. Very colorful with lost of detailing. My son is 1 yr and 9 mos- He doesn't play with it much. But when he does he is occupied for a while. He likes to knock it down more than putting it up. Be prepared to go on a hunt to find all the pieces. It's made from very strong cardboard, but it will show signs of wear very quickly. My toddler has already used the largest block as a step stool. My son is at the throwing stage, so I am very glad that they are not wooden blocks. I would recommend this gift, and I would certainly buy it again."
3,I had to bring it back...,"I don't think that this is a bad toy. It just was not the right toy for my almost 2 year old daughter. She loved stacking the blocks... but if she stacked them out of order, and one ""nested"" with another, she got very upset with the toy. So I had to help her pick which ones were next, which is fine except that I can't be there helping her at every moment. Oh and she was not interested in nesting the blocks at all. So to avoid frustration I brought it back. Still gave it 3 stars because it is really cute, and I am sure lots of kids would love it. Just not mine :)"
1,These are very ugly,"No one has mentioned how ugly these blocks are.The color scheme on each block is so painfully awful.Incredibly unattractive blocks.Very, very, very ugly.The colors that are on each picture are obnoxious.They are functional as stacking-nesting blocks, but the pictures are so ugly that I've thrown them out."
2,Good in theory,"I bought this for my two year old daughter for Christmas. I just knew she would love it. I was wrong. She played with it for about 5 minutes, and hasn't touched it again since December. My four old tried to play with it, but the blocks are not made out of the most durable material."
3,The price speaks for itself,Not very good quality cardboard boxes. My daughter played with them a couple of times and hasnt used them since. I am suprised at the quality of these cardboard boxes considering how good most things are from Melissa andd Doug.
4,Great toy for kids.,"We like this product, but wish it were a little more high quality. The blocks are covered in something like a paper sticker. We will see how it holds up. But it is constructed well and a great toy for kids."
4,perfect,My son received these blocks for his 1st bday and absolutely loves them...he is now a year n a half and still plays with them...they r very durable for being made of cardboard. He even sits on them and tries to stand on them. We both love to stack them together and then he HAS to knock them down...highly recommend!
2,2 year old disapproves,"These stacking blocks are cute, and priced appropriately. The bright colors and variety of scenes seemed like a great feature that I hoped would keep my 2 year old busy, but she isn't impressed. Maybe I'll put them away and pull them out in 6 months to see if her preference has changed."
4,Fun Toddler Toy,"My daughter has enjoyed this cardboard block set. She enjoys the blocks because they stack tall, unlike her smaller plastic building blocks, which do not stand well on the carpeting. She often builds up the blocks, knocks them over, and starts over again.She does not care about the pictures on the blocks, but she recognizes the letters, which are all written uppercase. Some of the blocks are difficult for a toddler to associate the picture with the letter (e.g. a rabbit with a rose for the letter ""R,"" but most toddlers would see a bunny with a flower).I have used the blocks for other games, such as ""Memory"" by hiding smaller objects (such a sock or paper) under the blocks and asking her to remember which object is under which block.I would recommend this product for children aged two-years and older. The cardboard blocks could easily be damaged by a younger child, rendering the blocks unstackable."
4,Great Blocks!,"We have had these blocks for a year at least, and my son has spent much time stacking them and, his favorite, knocking them down. He is 2.5 now. The pictures are wonderful, and each drawing has at least two items beginning with the letter that it illustrates. For example, there is a cow with a cake that has candles on it, an alligator with an apple, a penguin wearing pearls and carrying a purse, etc. I have even enjoyed trying to find everything in a picture that starts with the letter.I would definitely purchase these blocks again. They all fit into a box with a handle for carrying around.The only downside is that they are not especially durable, being made of cardboard. The edges are worn and some of the pictures are peeling. But I just tape them down. My son doesn't care!I do think we will continue to use these blocks to learn the alphabet for a long time to come; as long as they last."
3,Fun Yet Flimsy...,"I bought these blocks for my 17 month old son. Luckily they were not expensive because they are not very durable. I stack these for him, and he loves plowing into them to knock them down. Then he sits and puts each block into it's nesting partner, hands them to me, and we start the whole process over again...so they have been a great way for us to pass the time!Unfortunately, we've only had these blocks for a few weeks and they're already starting to fall apart. Made of cardboard, they're covered in stickers that soon start to peel. If you have a child who likes to put things in his mouth (as I'm sure most of us do), then the edges of the blocks will soon start to become flimsy and less block-shaped. I don't highly recommend these, but I also wouldn't tell people to avoid them. Just be aware that if you purchase them, you most likely won't have them very long."
1,Love Melissa and Doug; Think these are trash!,The toys usually are well made; these blocks are not! Spend a little more and get the wooden blocks they make with animals. If you want them for the alphabet get the regular blocks. These are poorly made of a thin cardboard wrapped in a sticker that has the printing and is meant to hold them together. They are VERY easily broken and came new with defects where the sticker didn't cover corners. I have two daughters that have many Melissa and Doug toys. I love all the other toys from them as do my girls.
3,"Great idea, shabby product","I bought this for my one year old a few months back and he loves stacking the blocks and knocking them down. It's been a great toy for improving his motor skills, hand-eye coordination, etc. But the paper on the blocks started peeling within a few weeks. At this point they're downright ugly. Next time i'm buying the wooden version, although i fear they may be heavier and more difficult to handle by little hands. Plastic, maybe?"
3,Alphabet nesting and stacking blocks,"Recently I bought this for my grand daughter who is about 18 months old and she was quite taken by it. While she cannot read or stack well , she takes the smaller ones and tries to stack them and, more than likely, when I stack them for her, she knocks them down.she likes the vivid colors and likes to reassemble them to go back in to the box. I am sure ,if handled well as they are made of cardboard, they will last a while and will be fun as a learning tool as she grows up and learns her alphabets, but for now she is still in A B and C only.shaku"
4,Joy,This is one of my three year old son's favorite toys. I only wish it was a bit more durable. It is made out of cardboard and has been well used for about a year and a half so I can't complain too much. For and kid that love to stack blocks and knock them over this is great!
2,fragile,"Sound okay, but shortly after they were installed the grill on one broke. They are installed below deck out of the weather."
5,Solved all of my husband's canker sore problems!,"My husband used Biotene for years and it only mildly helped his canker sore problem. (At any given point he has between 2 and 5 CRATERS in his mouth!) We read the reviews on the canker sore toothpaste from Rembrandt and thought we'd give it a try. Within two weeks he was averaging only 1 canker sore in his mouth at a time. Besides that, the sore isn't nearly as bad and heals DAYS faster! He is now a new man!"
3,"Rembrandt Whitening Canker Sore Toothpaste with Fluoride, Mint 3 oz.","Have used Rembrandt's Canker Sore Toothpaste for years and it has been very effective in reducing the severity of mouth ulcers and sores. The Canker Sore Toothpaste featured a large ""C"" on the box (where the ""G"" is now). Hope the whitening aspect of the toothpaste does not diminish the toothpastes ability to suppress the ulcers. I can always whiten my teeth with peroxide and baking soda, don't need it as an addition to my toothpaste. I do need it to suppress canker sores and ulcers."
4,"Rembrandt Whitening Canker Sore Toothpaste with Fluoride, Mint 3 oz..","This is the only toothpaste that helps with canker sores, which is a recurring problem for me, and this is one of the few sites where I can find it."
5,Best canker sore solution I have found!,"I couldn't find this toothpaste in the stores anymore so I bought some ""natural"" brand and almost instantly, my mouth was irritated. I am SO HAPPY to be able to order it online! I've suffered with canker sores my whole life and this certainly keeps them away for much longer than without:)"
5,Best for canker sore sufferers,I have had canker sore issues for years and this toothpaste does the best job of not contributing to them as other brands often do.
5,No More Canker Sores,The product-Rembrant Cancer Sore Formula Toothpaste-is a wonderful product for those who have the occasional breakout of cancer sores. It works for my husband so I would say to give it a try.
1,umm... no thanks,This band is one of the reasons rock is dying. well i take that back. rock is dying and these simple [...] are pulling on the chord of the life support system. this sound is nothing new and at times sounds melodic and painful. this cd makes me want to punch myself in the head for wasting my time listening to it.
5,Reach 454 A Good band with a good future,"Reach 454 is a great band and it has one of the best Debut's Album around it's really good it combines a nu-metal with hard rock which makes the album great songs like ""6 years"", ""Wake Up"" all of them the worst song on this album would be ""California"" but of the best for me was ""Come Apart"" featuring Jacoby Shaddix (lead singer of Papa Roach) it's really a great song great album"
5,Best nu-metal group ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I first heard this band on a video game commercial.I was burned out on Linkin Park and Chevelle so I looked them up on the internet.On there webpage you can listen to there music.So I did and now they are my favorite band...BUY THE CD
2,Not Much To It,"Reach 454 is like many other rock bands, they seem to only be in it for the money. (ironically the CD is extremely cheap)Not much work was put into the music itself. Like many bands, it is more noise than music, though there are a few tolerable tunes throughout the album.In addition, the song writing is mediocre at best.If you can get this for free somehow, or are willing to spend the money; this CD is worth A listen."
3,Copco Virtue Stainless Steel Teakettle,"Very nice teakettle however I had to return the item because one of my requirements of a teakettle is, that you have the option of keeping the spout open or closed with a lever that is connected to the handle. Unfortunately, this one does not have that option."
2,Screws in lid rust,"This is a beautiful pot that works well & looks good at a reasonable price. Unfortunately we have to return ours because the screws in the lid rust, staining the lid itself & dripping rust into the tea."
2,Awful!,The plastic rim to the spout melted after 3 uses. Seems like a major design flaw. Clearly not suitable for use on gas. Don't buy it! I sent mine back.
2,Poor quality.,"It ""looks"" great but the spout lid mechanism has already sprung. It never did whistle properly. It does boil water (so will a kitchen pot) but you have to watch it because the handle will get too hot and potentially all the water could boil away and cause bigger problems."
1,Plastic parts melt.,"After about two weeks of use, the whistle became substantially low. The reason was the plastic parts around the spout started to melt, and no longer fit properly around the spout. We're disappointed with this teakettle."
2,Cheaply made,"This kettle is nicely shaped and at first blush the push mechanism for opening the spout looks great. The problem is that it doesn't really work. The button is extremely stuff and we've had to push down on the lever that is doing the actual lifting to make the spout go up. In a word, it's cheaply made but not cheaply sold."
1,Bad taste,I liked the look of this kettle.I used it 4 times when I noticed my tea had a very bad taste.I did what was recomended useing baking soda and lemon boiling that with water for 15 min.it did not help at all.I tried it again nothing it was still bad tasting water.I called the company the did replace the tea kettle with a very cheap new kettle.I am very unhappy about this situation.I am sending the kettle back now and am getting a refund.
4,"Target You, the DVD","They did a great job at restoring some of the old films. Nine different movies are included on the disk. I got this for if nothing else the chance to see ""Duck and Cover"" again. I remember seeing that movie when I was in grade school in the early/mid 1960's. Now seeing it as an adult, I'm surprised that the film was almost 10 years old when I saw it! I grew up in those 'home shelter- civilian defense' days. I remember my mom sending me and my sister to the local, Redlands California, Police department to pick up all the handouts about making your own home shelter. WOW, what a difference 40 years made! For a historical, and often hysterical, look at all the things we DIDN'T know, watch this. I'd say rent it over buying but it's hard to come by which is why I went ahead and bought mine!"
3,not enough to last 24 hours,"I like many of these Berger fragrances but they are too pricey and don't last anywhere near 24 hours, as advertised."
2,Very rushed and dissapointing,"The versus books Tekken 3 guide was great, so I was expecting more of the same. I didn't get it. This book was obviously rushed out and terribly edited. There are obvious typos and references to juggle combo sections that aren't even in the book!The move list is fine and that strategy isn't totally worthless, but overall a complete dissapointment."
2,The biggest disappointment ever,"This book was supposed to be so much more. I heard about its development for months at Tekken Zaibatsu (THE Tekken site for those of you who don't know), and how many of the best players in the US were putting everything they had into this book. Final result- the book has been severely rushed. Even though there's a few good things in here, and it's way better than the Prima book, there's nothing in here that experts haven't seen before. Great book for beginners though and the best overall Tekken Tag book. Get the Tekken 3 Ultimate guide instead for more in-depth strategy."
2,Ends break!,"The concept is good, but the connecting ends with the slits break easily. Some ends are hard to insert into the other pieces. I wouldn't recommend this toy to anyone."
3,Dollhouse just okay....,"We thought our daughter would love this toy...after all, she loves Dora. She played with it for a little while and then became bored with it. We did as well. We found the dollhouse and furniture to be pretty pricey, and not that great. There weren't as many features as we thought there would be. Our friend's daughter has the Fisher Price Loving Family Dollhouse, and our girl loves it. The pieces are made alot better and have really neat features. If you are going to spend the money on a nice dollhouse, I would recommend the Loving Family dollhouse!!!"
5,great but furniture hard to find,"All three of my kids love to play with this dollhouse, ages 6, 4 &2. It's very durable and they love to play with their favorite characters, Dora, Boots, and Swiper.Best of all, it's even suitable for a little boy - my four year old son loves it. I like that it has two sides rather than just upstairs and downstairs - it allows more than one child to play easily.My suggestion for the holidays is to look at the loving family dollhouse furniture. It is the same size and price and much easier to find. This dollhouse comes with just a couch & some built in furniture, along with the family members, mom, dad, dora, boots, swiper, and diego. Not all have the bonus characters so look for boots, swiper and diego to be included."
2,Little People are Better,"My 3 year old insisted that she wanted this for Christmas. However, she now NEVER plays with it. She prefers the Calico Critters, which are small and intricate OR she will play with Little People which are more interesting than this dollhouse. The furniture (that you have to buy seperately) is very boring and straightforward with very few pieces. The bed turns into a bunkbed, but otherwise it is just a hard piece of plastic.Perhaps you think this dollhouse is a stage older than Little People. To me, it does not appear to be geared to a higher age group.I also have a gripe with the design of the house ... why not a handle on top and a latch on the side to close it up? Why not a place to store the furniture? It is awkward to move the house and to store the accessories.Overall, a waste of $90 (house plus 3 furniture sets)."
4,Not just for girls!,"My 3 year old son loves his Dora's Talking House. I knew from the box that it did not come with many accessories, so we bought some furniture the same day. I have had avery easy time locating extra furniture, although it does end up to be expensive for something that is all plastic, I think it was worth it because my son enjoys it so much. He also likes to bring the characters into his bath. I like that it collapses down easily, and it is cuter than I expected. If your child is a big fan of the show, and you can swing the expense, I would recommend it highly!"
3,"Great Toy, Very Educational but...where are the accessories?","My daughter (age 5) and son (age 2) love Dora and this toy. However, I agree with everyone before who stated ""where are the accessories?"". I've never bought a dollhouse that didn't come with furniture and I'm finding it impossible to get my hands on some. If you find them, they're usually out of stock. And, my next pet peeve is the cost. [...] That's as much as the toy itself! While the toy is great and educational, I can only give it 3 stars due to cost and lack of the accessories. I wish now I had read other reviews before purchasing it because I probably wouldn't have."
4,missing parts,This is a nice dollhouse I think when they made this dollhouse they should of included the furniture with it and up the price cause tring to find the furniture is nearly inpossible and the second floor looks real empty with out the furniture and so does the bathroom the mama dora and her papa is real big so its easy to keep up with them word of advise dont purchase this dollhouse if you want need the furniture to go with it cause you not going to find it except maybe after the holidays.
1,DORA THE EXPLORER DOLLHOUSE LETDOWN!!,I PURCHASED THE DORA THE EXPLORER DOLL HOUSE. BUT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE FURNITURE THAT ACCOMPANIES IT. EVERY STORE SAYS IT'S COMING IN...I WILL NEVER BUY ANYTHING AGAIN FROM THIS MANUFACTURER UNLESS IT'S ALLTHERE..
3,Dysfunctional Family House,"Bought this for Christmas for my then 2 1/2 yr old, I bought it in early November so I found the house, bonus figures and some extra furniture easily at TRU. Although my daughter does play with it now and then, I have 2 major complaints: #1 as others said - the figures don't fit the furniture well, and slide off too easily. (They should be more rubbery and pliable, and smaller!) My daughter puts all kinds of other toy characters in the house, but her favorite thing is to try to lower the roof- which she can't do since the buttons are on oposite sides of the house. This function is the most desirable to her yet it's made in such a way that it is only a source of frustration, even now at 3 yr's. I also think the price is high for what you get, especially since the ""talking"" house doesn't really talk much, and the furniture sets don't have talking features at all. The only other set I might purchase will be the pool set since my daughter is a big fan of the pool."
5,Happy Mom!,"My 4 year old got this toy for Christmas and she loves it! Its tons of fun, and the best thing about it is when shes done playing, it folds up nice and small! Lots of nice accessories you can get to go with it!"
2,Missy,"My daughter got this as a christmas gift. We were finally able to get the furniture for it by April. The doll figures are too big for the kitchen table and the bathroom. The bathroom furniture barely fits in the bathroom. Dora's Mom's legs do not bend at the knees, only the dad's. She cannot sit at the kitchen table right and most of the figures fall off the chairs -it takes some skill to get them seated. Dora's mom cannot sit good on the living room couch either. The figures are too big for the accessories. It is cute, but I would not have bought this for a doll house."
3,Where is the rest of it?,This toy is great but..... My daughter was wondering why Santa didn't bring the furniture that was shown on TV for this house. I was wondering the same. The accessories are impossible to find anywhere in stock. Also if it comes with a couch- why sell an additional couch for it. Why can you only get Dora and Diego's pets and acessories by buying another figurine. The toy is cute but would have gotten a lot more use if more accessories came with it.
3,Not that Impressed,"The Dora house is cute and colourful, however:1) The house is big and bulky and heavy for a child to carry2) The house has no handle and no lock so it comes open when trying to move it3) There is no room in the house to store the furniture and people if you were lucky enough to find some4) It talks very loudly and there is no volume control5) Cabinets, etc.. in the house are hard plastic and do not open6) The people are very stiff and my daughter asks me to come and sit them on the chairs or the couch because when she does it they fall offOverall, my daughter likes it but I am not overly impressed and it wasn't worth the trouble locating the two furniture sets we have. We do not have all the people either."
3,Way to expensive,"This is a nice doll house, but the cost should be cut in half. It comes with just the basics. We bought the living room and kitchen set and there is no room for anything else. My 3 -year old is constantly frustrated because she can't get them all to sit at the table. So my advice is skip the house and buy the accessories. I don't think she would care if we had the house or just the box it came in."
4,Mom of a Dora fan,"My almost 3 year old recieved this house of Christmas. It is a cute house. It is larger, larger than most Little People sets. It is too heavy and bulky for her to carry. The accessories are very hard to find. We were lucky to find the kitchen, living room, and bedroom before Christmas. Now we cannot find any of the ""Dora friends"" or any other rooms. Our Swiper met an unfortunate event with our one year old dog and now we can't find a replacement. In my opinion, the price is a little steep. The house has a few phrases, but not many. The kitchen cabinets do not open, which I believe they should. The accessories do not fit into the house when it is folded up. There is no volume control and the speaker is on ""floor"" of the house. If your child is a huge Dora fan, then buying this house will be worth it, but be prepared to find extra storage for the pieces and to drag the house everywhere your child wants it to be."
5,Dora's House,"When I saw this toy,I bought for my grandbaby who loves Dora for her birthday and was quite surprise how easy it was to open and close it. I like the toy because not only can she enjoy playing with it but she will also start learning a second language. This toy is really cute and you can't help but like it."
4,Make sure you read the box before you buy...,"Like others that have written reviews, I reccomend looking at the box. Imagine paying almost $50 for a dollhouse that came with nothing!!!! It came with Dora, Mami, and Papi...oh and one couch. My daughter had nothing to do but push one of the very few buttons that are on the house. I think there are three or four...that's it. She loves it but I was very disappointed. And the toys to go with it...everyone includes another Dora. How many Dora's does one child need?????"
2,Doesn't work,"The only sound that has ever worked is the doorbell. It took me the past month to finally realize that the house is supposed to make other noises.No wonder this toy has been gathering duston the coffee table. This is the one toy that my 3 year old daughter wanted from Santa, so I ordered it from Amazon without too much thought. I'm very disappointed, and I am not sure how to return it, since we've had it for a month."
3,Watch out for the,"As mentioned in the previous reviews, the Dora House is a great gift. Unfortunately, in our case it was not as advertised. We purchased this house prior to Thanksgiving. We did buy this at Toys R US because of the extra bonus figures. While setting the house up Christmas Eve night, we discovered that these figures were not in our sealed box. We were at the store the morning of the 26th and were told that the Dora houses no longer come with the extra figures at Toys R Us and there was nothing they could do for us!Be sure to check inside the box before leaving the store. [...]"
5,Dora a magnificant toy,Dora talking house is a great fun edecucational toy and children respond to it so well
2,WHAT A WASTE OF THE MOST WANTED CHRISTMAS TOY,"This is the main toy our 3 yr. old daughter wanted for Christmas. Boy was she disappointed. The lack of furniture that comes with it and there not being any available at any store since Oct., made it very undesirable to play with. The house just sits and once in awhile she will pull it out and play with it. I think it should have been available as a package deal that you could get the furniture and extra characters, not just characters. This toy taught me a lesson, just because a child sees something on T.V. and says they want it, doesn't mean you should go against your better judgment and buy it. What a waste of money."
1,THIS ITEM IS NOT WHAT THEY SAY IT IS!!!!,"I ordered this item, and when I received it (1 week before Christmas) Diego, Boots and Swiper figures WERE NOT included at stated!!!"
2,Dora House-Lots of Fun but...,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves this dollhouse we got her for christmas. We only wish we could have found more furniture. We're hoping to find more soon since the holidays are over. Also, it would've been nicer if the oven could open as well as the cabinets to make it a true little house. My daughter really wants to open the oven since something is cooking in there. The house could've used a latch to keep it closed. Too bad the house won't close with the furniture in it. Maybe they should make a little storage case...However, my daughter loves to play with it and I can't wait for her friends to come over and play with her, too."
4,Dora toy's keep getting better!,"This is a very well built, sturdy dollhouse. I bought this for my (almost) 4 year old daughter for christmas, and she has been playing with it daily every since. Even my 9 month old son loves it! The only thing I have a problem with is once you buy all of the furniture, you really have to cram it in there for storage. She has 4 more sets coming for her birthday, Greenhouse, Pool and Deck, Backyard Treehouse, and Mami and Papi's Bedroom, and I have no idea where we'll keep it. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I have had no problem finding all of the pieces. All at local Walmart's and Target. It must be a geographic thing.I wish they would make my daughter's favorites, Isa and Benny, hopefully soon. My daughter has loved Dora for years, and with toy's like these, I'm sure that'll continue!"
5,DORA'S DOLLHOUSE IS A BIG HIT IN OUR HOUSE!!,"My daughter received this dollhouse for Christmas. I had the usual complaint of trying to find furniture - only found 2 sets before Christmas - but this provided enough entertainment for the time being. I also found today the Pool and Greenhouse addition - these are two ""must have"" additions that also expand the talking fun. I am confident that in another month we will be able to complete the room additions and until then we will wait patiently. This is a great, sturdy dollhouse with fun for all."
4,lots of fun but not that functional,"My daughter loves Dora and we bought this for her third birthday. She is really into imaginative play and she has a lot of fun giving Dora a bath, or putting Diego on the bed for a nap. My problem is with the furniture sets. Since she is potty training, she likes to put Dora on the potty, but Dora is too big and cannot stay seated. Also the mommy and daddy have a hard time to sit on the sofa. I think it is a good toy, but the figures seem to big to particioate int he actions we want."
4,I learned a lesson from this toy!,"The Dora dollhouse has taught me to do my Christmas shopping early and make sure I pick up the accessories to popular toys as early as possible! That is the only reason why my daughter's Dora house is furnished at all. It seemed that for every TWENTY dollhouses available, ONE furniture set was available.The set is fun to play with but I believe a bit overpriced. I agree that more furniture should be included with the set."
4,Great House... to bad you have to buy the furniture separately!,"This is a great house! My 2 year old loves it! My 4 year old even plays with it. So far it has been very durable. The only downfall is that you have to buy the furniture separate. Only the couch is included with the house! For something this size & the cost, the furniture should be included!"
5,My Daughter Loves this toy,"My daughter received this house last year for christmas, Sh loves it. I could pretty much give all her other toys away and she would not care as long as she had her Dora Dollhouse. I love how they have add ons now so we can make the house even bigger and better. An A++++++ in my book."
2,not easy for a child to enjoy,"i was dissappointed with this house. My 3 year old girl loves Dora and was excited but when she started to play with it, it doesn't do much to keep a childs interest. They made one door open. No other doors,oven, cabinets, etc open. The family figurines don't fit on the couch and keep falling off. They should have made this so the figurines can use the furniture. THe first thing my daughter does is she goes to put the family on the furniture, and they fall off. They are hard to keep standing, not very flexible at all and i think they could have done some more things with this for them to enjoy.. Kids love to open and close things and if you're going to have house furniture, the figurines that go with it should fit easily. I got frustrated trying to get the Mami and Papi to sit or stand. How do you think a 3 yr old feels."
5,What A Great Find!,"Unlike other reviewers, I was able to find all of the accessories to this dollhouse. As with any dollhouse, you have to plan on buying accessories to make a complete set, so I assumed this before purchasing. My children love the dollhouse and the vercitility of the furniture. Many of these pieces ""transform"" to keep playtime fun!"
2,"Nice, but...","We thought it would be a nice toy for our granddaughter, but after buying it we found out that it comes pretty much stripped of furniture and any accessories are hard to find if not impossible. Recommend buying either other brands or wait untilhouse and accessories are available together."
2,"Great house, but no furniture!",I bought this for my 3 year old daughter for Christmas. She has been asking for it since the first time she saw the commercial! I quickly hid it away and just realized recently it didn't come with any furniture. I have family scouring the country looking for some. I am very disappointed she is going to open this Christmas morning with nothng to furnish it with- unless I want to go on Ebay and pay $50 for a $10 item! Someone at Nick Jr or Fisher Price messed up!
1,Way too much $$$ for an empty house!,"What a rip-off! Grandma got the house for my 4 yo daughter for Xmas. I can't believe a dollhouse that costs over $60 comes with only three dolls and a couch! The TV commercial and packaging are deceptive, showing all the items that must be purchased separately. In order to get a playable house, you have to spend an extra $30 or more. $90 is way too much for a plastic dollhouse!! I thought maybe there would be a lot of interactive ""talking"" featuring both English and Spanish to account for the price, but there are only about 8 phrases in all--hardly justifying the ridiculous cost. Next time I'll investigate more before sending the request to Grandma. My daughter could have had a much more playable house for much less $$$."
4,where are the accessories?,"My five year old son has a major crush on Dora. Thank goodness that the house is orange and not pink, since it was #1 on his Christmas list!! I shopped at my local Toy R Us early- and bought everything they had to go along with the house, which was only the bedroom set. It is now February and the other furniture sets are still not available! Where are they?? We did have some fun making furniture out of Legos and toy blocks, but come on, get with the program. With all of us angry parents out here why aren't they making more of this stuff?? They're losing revenue. Till the accessories are available my son may not be interested any longer!"
1,It's a big disappointment!!!,"I bought this house as an early Christmas present two months in advance, and I'm glad, because that leaves me plenty of time to return it and get something else. After I opened the box I was totally shocked to find the house empty except for one sofa and some characters. It's missing Backpack, Map, Tico, Benny and baby Jaguar and all of the furniture!! So you are forced to buy all accesories separately which means you'll have to spend at least another $100. And I thought the house was a bit overpriced even before I found out it's empty.."
5,I found the furniture,My cousin is buying the house and I just came across the furniture at Sears they had the bedroom set and the Kitchen or Dining set..pretty cool....
3,My 5 year old doesn't play with it often,"My daughter asked for this for her 5th birthday recently so I, reluctantly purchased it. I had a gut feeling it would be a dust collector & wanted to get her more of the Sweet Streets houses which she still plays with all the time after 12 months + having them. She played with the Dora House for about 30 minutes that day and maybe 4 times within the last 2 months. I also bought all the furniture separately (uugh!) and she uses it more without the house. I paid over $60 for the house alone & in my opinion it's not worth it."
4,Upset,"I have recently purchased the ""famous"" dollhouse. I am upset though that I can't find any of the accessories. I have searched all up and down the east coast and everywhere on the internet. (That includes Thailand, United Kingdom and China) It seems to me that if a toy this hot was going to be manufactured, than up the price, but include the accessories, I would have easily bought the entire set for $100 or so, it would have saved me the time of finding the other parts. Don't go to eBay, unless you are willing to pay up to $200 for the four pack of furniture alone. But, the house itself is amazing, if you can find the other pieces, I would recommend this to anyone with a child."
3,ok toy but needs work and my daughter was not impressed,we bought this for our daughter last christmas (she was 3 at the time) she liked it ok but she doesnt play with it that often. a downside to this is that you have to buy all the Toys to go with it. and my daughter found it hard to open the top level on her own. she played with it for a while but now it kinda just sits in her bedroom. maybe they could add a handle also! its hard to move from room to room (my daughter likes to bring her toys to the livingroom) not the best toy but it was alright.....
1,Where Can I Purchase The Furniture?????,I've looked all over for the furniture that goes with this house. I cannot find it anywhere. I've looked all over and on the internet. Why sell a dollhouse that you cannot buy furniture for? I wish we hadn't made this purchase. I wouldn't buy it again. Save your money and buy the Little People House and furniture. The Dora House is a rip off!!!!!
3,"'Exclusively at Toys R Us', I don't think so","Ordered this for my 3 year old for Christmas. Haven't even given it to her, yet and I'm not happy. Don't expect to receive the BONUS characters 'Exclusively at Toys R Us'. They don't come with the house. I have received the toy twice now and both times the characters are missing. Unfortunately I've had to scour other stores looking for them - my daughter wants them, what else could I do? So plan on spending a lot more time and money to get what the product promises but doesn't deliver."
5,Imagine the wonders,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter received this as a Xmas present. She loves it! I was a little surprised to see that it only came with 4 pieces, besides the house. I did go out & buy most of the sets for the house though. Now my daughter is spending so much time playing with it. She'll sit there for an hour or more at a time, & just play. It's the best feeling to see your child using their creativity! I did have some trouble finding the additional sets. My local Target was out of everthing. But when I tried a major Target in San Jose, I found everything! The pieces are very well made & bendable in the legs & arms. Overall, I recommend this toy."
4,Great Gift For Dora Lovers,"This was well worth my money, but its an expensive purchase after you get the accessory which are about $15 dollars a set but its worth it when a child's face lights up and appreciates it."
3,Needed some NE help....,"Once you turn on this cd, you can tell after the 3rd song that RT wrote all of them. I am a huge New Edition fan but he clearly needed New Edition's help on this project. On what planet were you on when you wrote most of these songs?"
5,the best ever!,The CD was worth the wait! I absolutely love Strange Emotions and Never Noticed. Ralph is what true R&B is all about.
3,Buy the 2nd edition instead,"I used these books for my Korean class at college. For the Beginning 1 book, we used the second edition, but were told to get the 1st edition of Beginning 2. I would highly recommend getting the second edition instead, because just comparing my Beginning 1 and Beginning 2 books, there is a huge different. The layout of the newer edition one is just so much more convenient and easy to understand. Not only that, but it looks a little nicer, too. If you don't need this version for a class, then definitely get the 2nd edition."
5,A wonderful read,"I was in awe reading about the adventures of Smoke Jensen and Preacher The action was fast and brutal, a real page-turner. You can almost smell the gunsmoke! I'm glad I finally discovered Mr. Johnstone."
5,Great Series,"I was a big Louis L'amor fan. Johnstone is an exciting author and reads very much the way L'amor does. This book begins a series about Smoke Jensen. It is excellent!, easy to read, and worthy of the time to read."
4,Superman,"I am surprised how durable the toy is. The cape and cowl seem to be made to last longer than those toys that came before. Also, lots of fun, my 3yo son plays with his three Justice League figures all of the time."
5,EXCELLENT FOR DISPLAY IN ITS BOX,"I must say i love this toy. I am a collector and because of that i wont open it to play with it. i think its just perfecto for display it in his box. Its big, excellent replica from the tv show and very cheap compare to his price. I already have the whole set (aquaman, martian, batman, superman, green lantern, wonder woman an flash). Hawkgirl is coming out late october 2004. As an action figure its not that good to play with it due to his lack of articulation, but as i said before, for dispaying its just perfetc. It comes in a window box package. Get'em all while u can!"
4,Lovely Wooden Creche',"Mary, Joseph & Baby Jesus must feel quite cozy in this little wooden creche' by Lenox. They look beautiful together under the wooden rafters, but there is no room in this inn for anyone else. All other figurines in the Nativity scene must be placed outside the creche'."
4,B Noir Picture,This is a well done B Noir Picture about crooks who try to take advantage of the last gasps of the Spiritualist era. I enjoyed it.
1,Horrible sound quality...,"I was surfing through amazon.com to look for speakers for my shuffle. I saw these and felt compelled to share my experience.I bough these speakers from Best Buy for 24.99. I admit they were cheap and I wasnt expecting much. They were on sale from 50.00 which is about average from what I have seen for shuffle speakers, being that it was the holidays and there were so many great sales going on it never occurred to me that they were 1/2 off for a reason.The sound quality of these speakers os HORRIBLE! I returned them the very next day! I got feedback or reverb anytime there was any kind of beat to a song and I couldnt turn it up loud enough to actually hear it. I wasnt listing to music that is particaularly bassey.So in short you get what you pay for...."
1,Killed another Ipod Shuffle,"I was stupid enough to try this product, and it killed my son's iPod Shuffle. Ouch!"
5,eye opener,This book changed the way I look at my adopted child- especially her errattic push and pull behaviors. I have bought it for her therapists. She started verbally asking me for her 'mommy' at 3 years old (she came to me at about 5 weeks old). I recieved no training or information from the adoption agency about her reliquishment or any issues that might follow. The Primal Wound may have started us on the correct path to save my child from the pain in her own soul.
4,Probably not for birthmothers to read,"After reuniting with my birthson, I felt that I owed it to him to learn how the adoptee feels about adoption...it was EXTREMELY painful. Birthmothers aren't told how adoption affects their baby, most will relinquish to give their baby a better life. This book adds to the trauma of losing your child to adoption. I've spoken to adoptees who have read and loved the book. They've learned alot about themselves and I think that's great. I believe this book would be great for adoptive parents as well, to know what to look for and to know why (the primal wound) the child is acting as he does."
3,Take it with a grain,"This book was a very good, informative book about the process of adoption and some of the issues that adult adoptees deal with. However, I have found other books more helpful for the reunion process, and felt that this particular book didn't really relate to my particular situation very well. It was sent to me by my birth mother, and other adoptees have mentioned it to me with rave reviews; however, I found that I was ""taking what I wanted"" and forgetting the rest. Unfortunatly, I found that I was ""forgetting"" quite a bit!"
3,interesting concept,"I bo't this book upon recommendation from my foster daughter's counselor. I read the first three chapters then realized that as i started the next chapter that the author tends to go on and on just elaborating on her basic concept that infants should never ever ever be separated from their birth mothers unless it is such a dire emergency. And one should be prepared for that infant to be forever scarred without much hope of living a fully healthy functional life. I truly believe the concept or theory of ""primal wound"" is a reality. But not to the extent the author does. Anyway, there was an excellent part on Fathers that i found to be very helpful toward the end of the book (I skipped around thru the rest of it)."
5,A gift for all,"This book has no equal. None. Zip. I've read them all. No fluff-n-stuff. Just packed with the correct info. I'm an adoptive mother as well as being adopted myself. I searched and found both birthparents. I slightly know about adoption? This author has it all correct. If you give this as a gift to an adoptee, an adoptive family or anyone working with adopted kids; there simply isn't a greater gift they could receive and they will be blessed beyond measure because of it."
1,No basis in reality,"I am disappointed and irritated with this book. I would think anyone with any kind of basic common sense and knowledge would have adequate valid and reliable statistics and facts before they made such extremely biased statements.My daughter is adopted, during adolescence, she gloamed onto this book and other's like it. She sunk into an extreme depression and began cutting on herself. We went to multiple therapies. Unfortunately, the popular premise back then was that if you were adopted, it was the root of all your problems. I began to question the ""popular"" premise and found that the idea the adoptee was mortally, emotionally wounded and the only solution was in the one who donated their egg, was without merit or evidence.My daughter continues to wallow in the self pity and darkness this propaganda extolls. She is 35 years old. I am sorry this kind of literature is allowed as anything but dark fantasy. It carries a high cost to those who believe it."
1,"Silly, Unsubstantiated Pop Psychology",This book is great for people that want to blame their problems on anything but themselves. Balanced people will want to steer clear.
1,Don't Waste Your Time ...,"On and on and on.... about adoption and separation from the birth mother, etc., etc.Was left feeling like adoption is HOPELESS..."
2,"This Book Got Me All ""Wound"" Up!","Whether you work in a library or an IRL bookstore, it's difficult to find good books about the early days of clock winding. Sadly, despite completely unscientific research by the author, ""The Primal Wound"" (it rhymes with ""round"") was unsatisfactory in almost every way imaginable. Sure, you get over 200 pages for your money, but there are cheaper sources of paper for bathroom uses than a new book. More illustrations of early clocks would have been quite welcome, but instead the book is just a bunch of worthless words that seem to have been thrown together randomly."
5,must get,So helpful. I'm an adoptee and had major break throughs with this book. It gives a different perspective and is well written.
5,Must read for all in the Triad,"A groundbreaking work, presenting the state of mind of those who have been separated at birth from their mothers. A must read for anyone in the Adoption Triad and any professionals dealing with adoptees. This book is the first real view of what it feels like to be adopted. As an adoptee who was reunited in 1984, I found this book the first validation of my feelings. I've found family therapists nationwide who have said that Ms. Verrier's work gave them real insight in dealing with their adoptee patients....END"
2,A gross generalization of the adoptee mentality,"As an adopted person who found her birth family after years of searching, I found Verrier's book very narrow and not especially applicable to me. I, and I imagine many other adoptees, feel that the wounds inflicted by spending my first 9 months in the body of an unwilling host finally began to heel in the loving arms of my adoptive parents. More time with my overburdened biological parents may have damaged me beyond repair. Her book should be hailed as an honest account of one woman's effort to understand the the emotional turmoil of her adopted daughter, and not as reflection of how all relinquished children and their adoptive parents feel. In short, for many of us the wound was formed early on. The separation from our birth parents was the beginning of the healing process, not the source of our pain."
1,Definitely take with a grain (or a ton) of salt,"Verrier focuses on the biological tie between child and birthmother to a positively mystical extent, making some very dubious and scientifically-unsupported claims in the process. It's certainly vital to raise people's awareness that adoption is never problem-free, and that it's impossible (as well as unethical) to try to cut a child off from their past, but to do so through a glorification of some primal pre-natal ""bonding"" is unhelpful to say the least. I found the book woolly, annoying, and at times positively deranged."
3,The Primal Wound: Understanding the Adopted Child,"I read this book many years ago. Verrier states her opinions. Everyone has a right to their opinions. However, I was disappointed about the <lack of references>. Generally, an author will cite *references* and studies to back up one's claims, opinions, or hypotheses. That is why I give this book only 3 stars. On the plus side, it was a quick read (possibly because I have read so many other books relating to this subject matter)."
1,Biggest Load of Bunk Ever,"This book is why adoptees are seen by the public as ""troubled"". Not all of us feel the so-called ""Primal Wound"", and I for one, am insulted by almost every sentence in it.My birth mother thinks this book and its author are akin to the second coming, but I say, why not think for yourself? You don't need a book (and a poor one at that) to tell you how you feel."
3,Good for some people,"I read this book in a matter of hours (which is not usual for me). I really found a lot of insight in this book to the feelings of many adoptees. I was adopted 30 years ago and I have been having some recent issues with depression. I have seeked help from a counselor who is working through some issues with my feelsing about my adoption. I found this book from some references on some adoption websites and chose to read it.Many of the issues that Ms. Varner discusses did not directly pertain to any feelings I had felt as a child nor do I feel now. I do agree with the ""Primal Wound"" theory, but I thought that the book was specificly geared towards a child acting out. I had a happy home life and have just recent began to have adverse feelings. I felt that the book was great, but was too specific to Ms. Varner's child and not to the general theory of the ""Primal Wound""."
1,Written by someone who is angry with the process,"I was very disappointed to see how one-sided this book was, and I don't believe in the philosophy that every adopted child has this primal wound. Making such a broad generalization like this is very harmful to those who are learning about adoption, and for the many adoptees who do not feel this way. This book pigeonholes adoptees into being victims regardless of their situation."
5,Primal Wound,"I feel that this is a must read for everybody adoptee, birth parent and adoptive parent and ever those that were just given away."
3,Confused,"I am a new adoptive mum of a 16 month old baby, who was excited and ecstatic about our life ahead. After reading this book, I was terrified of the apparent impending disaster which is to lay ahead of us. I do believe much of what she has to say is true, however, each time she mentioned that some adoptees ""say"" they don't have the feelings she talks about, she says it is because they are in denial. Let's not forget she is not an adoptee. I think it is a valuable tool to have, but I think it could also be a little dangerous.To be completely honest, I am just confused as to whether to bury this book at the back of the bookshelf, or call it my adoption gospel!"
5,The Primal Wound,"I found this book to be very enlightening and would recommend it to all members of the triad - especially to adoptive parents and adoptees as it really offers a perspective that is seldom offered in other books on the subject of adoption. I am an adoptee who saw a great deal of myself and my adoptive brother described in the pages of that book. My birthmother and adoptive mother also found the book impactful. Too many books on adoption seem to me to be little more than psychodramas around reunions, or do not address what it must be like for a baby to be removed from the only world it knows, thrust into a new world where NOTHING familiar remains, and not able to process what is happening. I've seen this book both praised and criticized from those in adoption circles (newsgroups and the like). This ""chosen baby"" thanks Nancy Verrier for writing it and wishes she had written it years ago."
5,So Very Revealing About the Adoptee,"This book by Nancy Newton Verrier says more about the way the adoptee perceives life, and how he presents himself to the rest of the world, than does any book I have read previously on the subject. I have read perhaps 50 books on adoption since my teen years, and Nancy Verrier's is the one I come back to over and over. I loved her book, and have recommended it to many friends and aquaintences over the years. She presents the whole story, not just a one-sided blurb to support that one side's 'issues.' She is a supreme writer, and in spite of the deeply emotional and buried theories on why the adoptee is like he is, she presents her ideas in a very easy-to-read format. I could not recommend this book any more strongly."
1,lots of generalizations,"This book is written as though every adopted child is broken, damaged and beyond repair..I'm sure these issues exist and my adopted daughter and I are working through some - which is why I ordered this book. But once it arrived and I read the first several chapters, my gosh, I was so discouraged because this book makes it sound like she's hopelessly damaged. So i just outright asked her if what the book said was true and she rolled her eyes and said ""I'm sad and I wonder about my birthmom, but gosh mom, it isn't as bad as this book makes it sound.""so I returned the book and will trust my instincts a little more in the future!"
4,28 yrs in the boonies,After having heard of the story and seeing where he had lived near the Talafofo falls it was great to read it for myself.It's a translation which at times flows better than other with a few typos.There wasn't a lot of specific information regarding exactly how he survived which may put off those looking for step by step instructions.
3,Helpful info,Good information but not quite the book I was looking for. Most information I already had on hand. Book is in great condition and I will keep for friends who are anticipating a Macaw purchase. Thanks for quick shipment.
1,This book is hazardous to your bird's health!,"As a veterinary technician in an avian hospital, I can tell you that this book gives poor and even dangerous advice concerning the care of macaws and other exotic birds. The avian veterinarians with whom I work have read the book and feel the same way. I would strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this book. Your local avian veterinarian would be much better suited to recommend books which give accurate information about birds and their care. Great photographs are the ONLY benefit of owning this book but hardly worth the false information printed within."
2,READ ME!! Complete Manual? More like brief intro!!!,"Summary: Very scant on useful information. Some nice info, general details and history with beautiful pics, but 'complete manual' ends there.Pretty book for the coffee table but that is about it.Plenty more info needed.Save your money and get a better book."
5,I recommend it to parents for everyday use,"Both me and my wife have been reading this book regularly to understand our children better. It is both interesting and practical. What I like best about it is that its recommndations as to how to raise children are mostly based on experience and research, not on anyone's opinions.And one more thing: my two-year-old daughter LOVES the pictures inside!"

2,Brighton Mums Ahoy!,"Calling all Brighton Mums! This magazine presents a relatively contrived viewpoint on contemporary interior design, smothered in advertising for crisp, white bed linen and pressed quartz bench tops.

4,Billy Jack,We were discussing this movie one night and wanted to see if it was available for viewing then found it on Amazon. It is an old movie but we enjoyed seeing it again
3,Okay but problems,"The movie was good, but did not play properly. Was siezing up and had to reload at least two times. This is the only Amazon movie I have experienced such difficulty with."
4,What we wanted to do . . .,"Well, I guess an annual is sure to be ""old"" by the next year. But I found a lot of what was laughable about human foibles in 1994 still can shake some bellies.I found this book only because I was looking for a copy of Ron Carlson's ""What We Wanted To Do"" short story that got a party laughing out of control when it was read aloud, a few years back.If you find the explanations of U.S. administration officials before congressional review bodies laughable, you will find this one story worth the price of the book. It begins: ""What we wanted to do was spill boiling oil onto the heads of our enemies as they attempted to bang down the gates of our village, but, as everyone now knows, we had some problems,..."""
1,Seems pretty right wing to me,"From what I can tell by the reviews on this page, all the proposals in this book are basically libertarian. It is thus highly misleading that the book calls itself centrist. The fact that only one person on this page has realized this, yet seems to think it's a good thing, is also rather disturbing.The book seems like a thinly veiled attempt to move political dialogue rightward by making radical neoconservative proposals--many of which the Bush administration clearly supports--seem moderate.Let's call a spade a spade."
1,Radical Center - term coined by a rancher,"I don't know if the authors acknowledge this or not, but Bill McDonald first coined ""radical center"" as a way to describe the growing movement toward building cooperation and consensus in terms of resouce managment in the west. Bill is co-founder of the Malpai Borderlands Group and a MacArthur Genius Grant Recipient. He has been using this term, as are many rural communities (specifically western), for at least 5 years now. As one of the authors is described as a writer for the New Yorker, a magazine that has shown remarkably little interest in the viewpoints of working class western people, let alone its intellectuals, such as Dan Kemmis, I do hope the authors found their way to the origins of the expression. . . ."
2,Need a solutions manual,"I had a hard time following the concepts presented in this book. I agree with the previous reviewer that the example problems were particularly easy, followed by only medium-hard to hard problems in the excercise section. If the text had a solutions manual (not hard to to since there are 100's of problems in each section) it would be easier to see where I'm making my mistakes.Other than that, the pictures did help with my understanding of the material."
2,Poor problem solving examples led to disgust with this text,"This text is good at using wordage to explain how to understand concepts and problem solving techniques. However, like most people, i find that I need to see these things worked out to understand these concepts. The material itself is satisfactory in this book, however there are only about 2 worked out examples per concept in this text, and some of these concepts can be difficult to grasp. Lastly, intermediate problem solving is often not made clear in this text. If you are the type of person that likes to read a lot to understand statics, then this book may be for you, but if you are a person that needs clear demonstration of the concepts and techniques visited in this text, this book is definitely not for you. By the way, these comments also apply to the Dynamics book that is also written by Beer & Johnston."
2,"Statics is silly, take calc III instead.","I do not recommend this book. This textbook is difficult to follow, it is difficult to grasp new concepts from the book. This book is not detailed enough, it often does not show all the steps that are taken in an example problem; this makes it difficult to understand many of the problems, especially the more difficult ones. I would also suggest that if it is possible, take calculus III before you take statics.Calculus III gives a much better and more thorough explaintion of the basis of vector mechanics. If you want a book that lays a better mathmatical base for vectors and vector mechanics, try reading ""Calculus, 5th ed."" by James Stewart. This book is an excellent indroduction to statics and it explains in much clearer language the derivations for of many of the equations presented in vector mechanics."
4,"Great book, would be great with soln manual","This is a great book (aside from the one by Meriam and Kriege). Illustrations are clear, examples were clear with no steps missing. However...some problems are on the challenging side--great for training engineers, but not cool for homework without a solutions manual for the sticky (and usually even numbered) problems. Recommended nonethless!"
5,Incredible book!,This book help me a lot in understanding the concepts of Statics in a simple way that reflected in good scores in my grades.
3,Statics Textbook Review,I have been using this book in my Statics class for about three weeks now. We've gone through the first two chapters. It is a typical text book. The information is provided in section form and at the end of three or four sections there are sample problems to work. So far there isn't anything outstanding about the book nor is there anything bad.
1,Don't waste your money on this book - buy hibbeler's book,This statics book is horrible if you're trying to understand a new subject. The problems that follow the readings are not close to the sample problems that are worked out in those sections. I bought Hibbeler's book on statics which is WAY better than this book. It covers the same amount of material in a fraction of the pages and explains the subject in a way that's far easier to understand.
1,ARGHHHH!!!!!!,"Gives examples with no reasoning behind them.I am a returning student, 10+ years out of H.S. I recently completed calc based physics 1 (A-), calc 1,2,&3,(A,A-,A) and other similar courses, with some good instructors, some less than ideal, requiring that I read and understand the text book. This book fails to provide useful instruction, My instructor fails to present materials in an understandable manner, and this text does not make up for his shortcomings."
1,The worst textbook I own,"This book has plenty of problems for you to solve, yet they outnumber the sample problems by at least six to one. The layout is horrendous as there are pages of problems to solve after each section so if you want to go back to review a point from the previous section, you can flip through pages of problems. Wikipedia has been more useful than the book at explaining concepts."
5,Good!!!!,"Now with such a challenging class I must say I'm glad I didn't spend as much money as other students did for the right book. I am glad I buy from Amazon and have yet to be seriously disappointed. This is book arrived in good condition, the edges were a little bent but now a big deal. Would purchase from this seller again because my book arrived rather quickly!"
1,Worst seller EVER! I NEVER received the book! It was never sent!,"This is not a review of the product BECAUSE THE SELLER NEVER SENT IT!!! This seller failed to respond to any emails. The product was NEVER shipped. Do not having any dealings with this seller, or you will surely regret it. Amazon should ban the seller: AWEISER from selling on their site."
3,Misleading subtitle,"The subtitle ""The tragic story..."" for this particular DVD release of the film is misleading. As other reviewers have pointed out, this documentary is mainly of interest to people who are already familiar with Reich's life and work. As such, it is very fascinating, and an important historical document, but it does not serve as an introduction/education for everyone who is new to the subject. Also, there is a newer edition of this film available here on Amazon, with better picture quality, a different cover design, and without that subtitle which was apparently not part of the original title anyway:Wilhelm Reich: Viva Little ManTo all fellow Reich enthusiasts, I therefore recommend to get the new release."
1,Not for purists,"I had the ORIGINAL original soundtrack record album when I was a kid and played it till the vinyl wore out. If you want to hear the music you love and do NOT want it to be broken up with second rate outtakes cut in with the really beautiful symphonic pieces, then do NOT buy this album. Frankly I think it's dishonest to call it the original soundtrack. It is not. As far as the ""extra"" music they included, there was a reason why it never got into the movie. It was NOT GOOD ENOUGH."
5,YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW IT GOES READ THIS!,I THINK THIS BOOK IS A GREAT BOOK. IT TELLS YOU ABOUT HOW THIS DIEASE CAN CHANGE YOU LIFE .AN IT TELLS HOW WITH GOD YOU CAN LIVE A FULL LIFE WITH AIDS AND WALK IN VICTORY.
5,Turn the CD player on and start dancing with your little one!,Love this CD! Makes a great gift and gets the little ones to boogie down!
5,This had me jamming at work!,"I just bought this for my 8 month old daughter. I brought it to work to listen to it and just had to write a review because I enjoyed it so much. It had me singing along and I even had to shut my door and dance to ""Go Baby Go""I can't speak to how much my daughter will like it, but I sure had fun with it. It has a lot of fun lyrics, movements and sounds for kids, and it does sound different than your average kids CD, but still accessible. The short tracks highlighting drums, bass, trombone, etc introduces kids to instruments. I'm sure she'll love it."
4,A fun CD for kids,"This is a fun CD to listen to and my daughter seems to really enjoy the Jazz. It is great to expose kids to all kinds of music, so this is just one step in that direction. Good for adults to listen to, too, as it is upbeat and just plain fun."
2,baby music,"it is ok, but I was looking for music my son and I could both listen to without me going crazy...and this is not it."
4,Very good book.,"This book is an outgrowth of an earlier work. It is well-illustrated, and produced by the bona-fide lineage of the Founder, which gives it a definite Aikikai slant (although this is not a bad thing)."
5,aikido master,"best use of illustrations of any book reviewed on this subject. The incorporation of philosophy befits his father,the founder.complements the basic well."
2,Not In The Same Class As Naked Gun,"I was disappointed by the low level and frequency of the gags in this 6 show run from the doomed TV show ""Police Squad"". Initially, I laughed at the first few gags and thought all the poor reviews were just from ""Crazy People"". The jokes are few and far between, and of low intensity because ... remember, this was for early 1980's TV ... and the NETWORK CENSORS of the Reagan era. I should have tried to view it through Netflix first. Now I wish I had my money back. Enough said."
5,The Funniest,"The father of the Naked Gun movies. Alot of the gags from the movies were on TV years before. I like Peter Lupus as Nordberg,probably a little MI hangover. Stupid slapstick at its best. Right up there with the Three Stooges."
4,Hilarious Series,"Excellent 6 episode series from Leslie Nielsen. Fun, bizarre and downright hilarious. Definitely a must see for all those who loved him in the Naked Gun series and Airplane! I must also note that the Zuckers, fine makers of Top Secret, the Naked Gun series and more recently Family Guy did a fantastic job. I highly recommend this collection!"
5,"If you like the Naked Gun Movies, you'll Love Police Squad.","The three guys who created Airplane, Hot Shots, the Naked Gun, and other hilarious shows are finally releasing their greatest creation yet. Police Squad was a failed television series that inspired the later Naked Gun movies and used many of the same jokes. But here it is fifty times as funny, and not nearly as nasty or obseen. Leslie Nielsen stars in the series as Frank Dreban and his comedic timing always shines through. Watch for the scene in the boxing episode where the boxer screams out, ""Nobody owns Bobby Driggs, NOBODY"", and as he turns his back to the camera, on his shirt is printed the words ""Property of Martin"". Shows don't get any funnier than this. And while only six episodes were ever filmed, each one is so classic, you can watch them over and over again. Pick up Police Squad, and you'll be laughing the whole night through."
3,Freeze!,A short lived series that was a head of its time. I watched this as a kid and remembered it to be funnier than it seems now. I still enjoyed the DVD and the shows hold up pretty well. There is a new interview with Leslie Neilsen that is interesting. The bad news is there is commentary by some of the people involved in writing and producing the show and it is horrible. The sound quality is terrible and none of the B.S. in insightful.
4,Grateful this is preserved on DVD!,"The only reason this gets 4 instead of 5 stars is that some scenes have been inexplicably replaced with gag-less filler. In ""The Butler Did It"", a wealthy business man hosts a party for his socialite daughter who, during the dance with his daughter, asks the band to play ""Something Different"". They then surprise her with a traditional ""Happy Birthday to You."" Funny? No. But, in the VHS version, they play a silly, stupid, song called ""Something Different"" which all the guests seem to know as a birthday tribute. It was hilarious. At least one other episode has a similar music change, causing the moment to move from side-splitting funny to mildly amusing. I can't believe this is a copyright issue since these episodes were out on VHS previously.Many of the gags were repeated throughout the Naked Gun series, but in Police Squad they come rapid-fire. Even with the qualifier, this DVD is superior to the entire Naked Gun Series it spawned."
4,Too Shortlived,"I was unaware this series even existed until I purchased the Naked Gun trilogy and it appeared in my recommendations. Since I'm a fan of the movies I had to get this too, and it really is a rare jem as another reviewer stated. It was a hilarious series that actually had some continuity between episodes; for example they named all the people they locked up at the end of each ep. What I don't understand is why only six eps were made? Most shows, even the unpopular ones, are at least allowed to pull off a half season, in the double-digits. There's also a lot of repetitive jokes, such as the cigarette one, that were funny at first but quickly lost their punch. Overall a great (mini) series and this disk even has some good extras. If you're a fan of the movies I'd say get this too."
5,Am I seeing things??? DVD?,Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! This just made my friggin' month! 20 year fan with grainy tapes to prove it. Great show - too bad most of the country was too clueless to get the hunor. I'm all over this!
5,Another lost classic returns,Put this alongside the great Tick live action show. A must have for comedy fans.Best dialog:Bad Guy: Who are you and how did you get in here?Dreben: I'm the locksmith... And I'm the locksmith.
5,Police Squad! A Great tv show that nobody got!!,"I have watched this three times, and still laugh out loud, the only thing wrong is that they only made six of these masterpieces!!!! If you liked Naked Gun and the rest of the movies , then you will LOVE these. They are the start of the series , and in some cases they are better!!"
4,As dumb as I remembered.,"This show was pretty much the parent of Airplane and Naked gun. It is interesting to watch these 6 episodes and see where the style was honed. These were simply a parity of the cop shows of the time and as such they were very well done! The only problem is , as the commentary states, you have to watch them. If you glance at the tv every few minutes you will miss out on the jokes.You really have to look for the hidden jokes."
4,FINALLY! But audio could have been better ........,"I won't bother repeating how great the series is or how long I have waited for a copy of the complete set. They are all here now. But I do have one complaint, the audio could have been better. Sounds like a mono recording and the levels tend to go up and down considerably. Music and gun shots are loud while voices are soft, that sort of thing. But I would buy this DVD again in an instant!"
4,police squad - the series,"if you liked the ""naked gun"" movies this is a must!this series came out before the movies but was not very widely distributed. same kind of humour and great fun for all. - Kevin Hodgins"
5,Hilarious!!!,"The entire DVD is dead-pan telling of puns and bad jokes. This is a take-off of all the old black-and-white TV police shows: Dragnet, Peter Gunn, M-Squad, and others that I don't even know. The show is stupid beyond belief, but that is what makes it funny. There are jokes that I didn't find until after I watched an episode four times. It never gets old. Watch it late at night."
4,Short Tv Show,"We remember the Naked Gun films about a inept and absurd Liuteniant Detective played by Leslie Nielsen.This six episodes are the Tv series created by the ZAZ(Zucker,Abrahams) the same as Airplane where Nielsen also had a role.The series were a dissapointment and only run 6 eps as viewers didn't see how the visual humor and 2 acts and epilogue were.Also the eps have unique aspects never repited in subsequent shows.In the start credits a guest star died in the most absurd way.In the end credits actors are froze and all the scene while the credits were displayed in the screen.I never saw this here in Spain as never was broadcasted."
4,The funniest police work since The Andy Griffith Show,"Canadian-born Leslie Nielsen had television audiences laughing for a couple of months in 1982 with this buffoonery-packed short-lived series POLICE SQUAD. Nielsen is lieutenant Frank Drebin,who comes complete with gags. Alan North is Frank's partner Ed Hocken,who's the serious one compared to Frank and Officer Nordberg. The running time for these six episodes is much less than the three NAKED GUN films(inspired by this series) combined. Nielsen reprised his role in 1988 in the Paramount film THE NAKED GUN:FROM THE FILES OF POLICE SQUAD. George Kennedy played Ed Hocken and football great O.J. Simpson played Officer Nordberg. Two sequels followed,THE NAKED GUN 2 1/2:THE SMELL OF FEAR in 1991,and three years later,THE NAKED GUN 33 1/3:THE FINAL INSULT."
5,Police Squad! The Complete Series,"If you like the movies: ""Airplane, Kentucky Fried Movie,and Naked Gun,"" you will love this series! This hilarious TV show was not appreciated and lasted only 6 episodes. Many of the lines and sight gags that you saw in this series wind up in the ""Naked Gun"" movies. Leslie Nielsen is brilliant as ""Lieutenant Detective Sergeant Frank Drebin."" If you want side splitting juvenile type of humor that your (female) significant other will not stand, BUY THIS DVD!!!!!!"
4,old series but still funny!,I remember when this series was on TV. It always made me laugh and it still does!Lots of sight gags and one-liners.
5,"Great , Funny Show","This a very funny show! I discovered these episodes on video back in the 90's, but its great seeing them again on DVD! Great for repeat viewing and A must for Airplane fans or Leslie Nelson fans!!!!"
5,Don't call me Shirley!!!!,This is where the Naked Gun movies started. Sight gags and deadpan Leslie Neilsen make this a howl. This is the inspiration for the Scary Movies as well. Enjoy it!!!!
5,"A gem of ""Jewels""",Delicious dancing. The French have the most beautiful feet! Don't miss the documentary about Balanchine which runs at the end.
2,Blurry movement indeed,"I have to agree that the DVD is not of very good quality. Movement is indeed blurred. This is, in fact, the only ballet disk which I have where I have noticed this to such an extent. ABT telecasts of such ballets as Swan Lake or Le Corsair on DVD are much superior in terms of the quality of the disk. I found it coninually interfered with my enjoyment of the dance. One other complaint-- sometimes exits are as exciting as anything else in the dance. No one who ever saw Edward Villella will ever forget his whirling off the stage after the 'playing tag' section of Rubies. On this DVD, the camera cuts away before the dancer's exit!"
5,Love It! :),"Another cd that I have LOOKED and LOOKED for ....for years....And thank the LORD...I FINALLY found it on Amazon!Very cool Christian techno songs...My favorites are ""The Big Rock"" ....by Ma'ire Brennan....She is the sister of ""Enya""....Very fun techno song....I finally looked the words up online.....and WOW....I had never understood what she was saying....but here it is...Cr√≠osta √≥ cumhdaigh m√©Cr√≠osta coimh√©ad m√©Cr√≠osta coinnigh m√©Cr√≠osta an R√≠Cr√≠osta √≥ treor√°i m√©Cr√≠osta √≥teagasc m√©Cr√≠osta an R√≠(Christ cover meChrist guard meChrist keep meChrist the KingChrist deliver meChrist guide meChrist teach meChrist the King)POWERFUL! Enjoy!Seller was great....quick shipping....just as described....no problems.....! God bless you!"
3,precision screwdrivers,"This set isn't bad, the handle has a small grip section, and the whole handle bends at that point. I bought these last week (dec 6 07) for 2.52 a set right here, at that price they were well worth it, at 7.95 they're not."
4,beavis and butthead dvd,the dvd set is okay butt they really should release complete seasoned box sets on dvd instead of just putting out mikes favorites.
1,Banality Plus,"I don't think I've ever heard anything quite as uninspired as these little piano pieces, though the piano music of Felicien David comes close---you will be bored to death. The piano writing is far too simplistic, more suitable I suppose for a child's hand and capability, but there is nothing melodically or thematically gripping about anything here to make these pieces worthwhile even for a child piano student---there are so many better simple pieces out there to choose from! I found nothing here to enjoy, unfortunately.Avoid this disc."
3,Worth a look for fans of low budget sci-fi.,"Claude Akins and Wil Wheaton give great performances in this low budget film based (without credit) on H. P. Lovecraft's ""Colour out of Space."" A glowing meteorite falls on a Tennessee farm. The meteorite melts away and the glowing white energy inside escapes and goes into the water well. This causes odd mutations. The special effects vary in quality, but are slightly dated at worst. The characters of Zach and Alice form a contrast with the rest of the characters, who are ""larger than life"" in one way or another, with some of the actors properly hamming. It seems the effects of the energy are supposed to represent moral contamination."
3,"Claude Akins is great in this low budget ""food"" film.",Something in the food in this small town is turning the people into monsters. Good special effects. Claude Akins and Will Wheaton both do excellent performances. Not for the squeemish.
2,The Colour Out Of Space,"A faithful rendering of Lovecraft's ""Colour Out Of Space"", this movie just doesn't quite cut it. It's dull, poorly-acted and not very interesting. Stick to the story if you like Lovecraft."
5,A superb translation,"This is by far the most readable and enjoyable of the several translations of Lucretius that I have read. Humphries was a poet, and it shows. He has captured the ideas of Lucretius and expressed them in vivid English."
5,Wonderful,"I ordered this with some trepidation: Lucretius was difficult enough to understand in prose, never mind poetry. It turns out that this translation is the CLEAREST and MOST READABLE Lucretius I have ever seen. Lucretius is an author I read regularly. He has accomnpanied me through my life for years. This is now the translation which I will turn to. This is a book to study, memorize sections from, enjoy, and be dazzled by. I want to thank the author for his evident love for the material to turn out such an excellent translation."
4,Just a caveat for the Latin student...,"This is a fine prose translation for those who wish to read Lucretius' poetry in English and learn about his philosophy. It is not, however, a very useful tool for the Latin student looking to make sense of Lucretius' language, which can be quite difficult at times. Humphries' translation is NOT very literal or faithful to the original Latin; in fact, there are many times when matching the English and Latin texts together is surprisingly difficult.I would suggest this translation for those who aren't reading the poem in Latin, but for students of the language, look elsewhere - this translation will not be very helpful."
2,present for friend,"I purchased this as a present for a friend who has redhair, i thought it would be a cuteish gift for her, turned out to be a soul searching type book which took a while to arrive there and upon examination was way too somber to give to my friend."
1,"Haven't read the book, but...","I'm a redhead, and the title of this book is incredibly insulting. This author had better get it into her mind to choose less offensive titles for books. I have not read the book and have no intention to do so."
4,Hansel and Gretel,"I bought this movie on a whim .I like Dakota Fanning a lot.She's always been such a little sweetie-pie.Although it's a silly fairy-tale, I actually like that sort of stuff from time to time. It helps me to unwind after a bout with the evening news.Dakota [or Duck Odor,as I sometimes call her] is an excellent artist that I admire quite a lot.Good Luck with your life, Miss Fanning."
5,ONE OF MY FAVORITES!!!!,This is the movie I watch when I need a laugh with no strings attached. I bought my first copy years ago not knowing what to expect and was pleasantly surprised by the modern twists and the unexpected turns. There was just enough of the original story line to keep me on track without boring me. I've gone through four copies only because I lend it to friends (all were single and childless also) who understandably adds it to their collection. Each person had his/her own favorite line but we laugh at the others when we compared notes. I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE ONLY IF YOU WANT TO BE ENTERTAINED WITHOUT HAVING TO THINK.
1,Quite possibly the worst film ever made,"How this has received such good reviews here is unfathomable. This is an execrable, painfully unfunny film. Don't waste your time."
2,OH WELL.....,"Hansel & Gretel was o.k., but I like the Cannon Movie Tales one better. It kind of dragged on and on and on with Howie Mandel, even though I've always loved him-especially in Little Monsters. If given the opportunity to preview it before purchasing, I would have passed on the purchase and bought another movie that I truly like better. valilly"
1,"Bastardization of A Good, Classic Tale","This movie was horrible!!! I watched it with my twin 6-year-olds and we were all equally bored and disappointed with this video! It was just SO far off from the story and all these extra characters (an excuse to add some star names to the mix), just came and went randomly. Most of the jokes seemed more aimed at adults than the kids it is intended for. My kids, however, are OBSESSED, with the older version of this story starring Chloris Leachman as the witch and complete with the original Engelburt Humperdink music. The video is hard to come by though. Someone should re-release it. It's great."
1,Stupid. Boring Plot but my 3 year old loves it.,The characters are grating...the writing feels like its trying WAY TOO HARD (ie...forcing in current cultural jokes that fall flat). The best word I can find to describe this movie is annoying....no Stupid. No silly. I'm not sure which but its really hard to sit through as an adult. That said my 3 year old thinks its great and requests to watch it again and again.
2,Not for Adults,"My husband and I often enjoy fairy tales and the like. This was an exception. I will admit that 5-11 year olds probably love this, but why suffer thru it with them. If you like this lame movie you'll probably like The Magic of the Leprechauns too. If you want some clever script-writing, adult laughs, and decent acting in the genre, get Jack and the Beanstalk (The Real Story), Tenth Kingdom, or Snow White: The Fairest of them All."
4,Great for all ages,"Okay, I passed on this one for a while, until I got to see a few clips. All the actors are great and it has just the right touch of satire and unexpected twists to keep your interest.Delta Burke is perfect. Taylor Momsen shines.My favorite line of the whole movie--""I see fairytale people"" ---delivered by Dakota Fanning--always a great actress in everything she's in.Highly recommended for your DVD library."
4,"For the price, it's nice","I've seen very inconsistant reviews for Silver Insanity items. I received this necklace for Christmas last year, and it's pretty nice. Generally I always receive a compliment when I wear it. For the price, it's worth it. If you're looking for something nicer, you're simply going to have to pay more."
3,There are better recordings,"The performances have some intonation issues. A superior collection is from the Panocha Quartet, however it is a bit more expensive."
3,not the best,"This isn't the best of the X-Men I've been reading lately. Claremont has produced some of the greatest X-Men stories of all time, but here he falls short. Their time in the Savage Land gives an okay story, maybe one that would be really good if it were someone other than Claremont. The other X-Treme X-Men that I've read are pretty good though."
4,The savage land just got more savage.,The x-treme x-men( storm rouge bishop beast and others) go to the savage land to investigate some strange happenings.
2,alternative to hip replacement surgery,"I was looking for a book to guide me in postponing or avoiding hip replacement surgery. The title ""The Active Person's Guide to Taking Charge"" prompted me to buy this book, but I was disappointed in the book because so little of it was devoted to really taking charge of your physical situation so that you can strengthen your hip and achieve its maximum flexability. A better choice for those wishing to do everything in their power to avoid or postone surgery would be Dr. Klapper's book, ""Heal Your Hips"", which is also available from Amazon.com"
1,Make sure you buy the right one.,This did not fit my truck. I couldn't role the window up after I had fought with it for a long time. Thankful Amazon took it back.
3,They look good but.........,"The visors look good, but did not install as easy as shown in the video. My window channels are not all that deep in the front of the window and there is not much lip on the visor to hold on to the rubber stripping in the window channel. I had to use contact cement along with the 2 sided tape. Will it hold? Time will tell."
4,Cyberliteracy Book,The book was delivered in a reasonable amount of time and in good condition. I would definately do business with them again!
1,Don't mean to hate but . . . . .,"I'm sorry but it all sounds the same to me. The novelty is wearing thin when it comes to Filipino R&B/Rock Pop groups. There are exceptions like Pinay, Kai, Drop N Harmony & Julie Plug but they come few and far between.Much props for putting out an album thou. I myself can only wish that my group could put out even a single.""Don't imitate, innovate!"""
4,Definitely A CD Worth Buying!,"When I interviewed them on PhilRadio International, they had just released their single, ""When I"" which is included in this full CD. I knew then that they were going to be widely accepted not only in the Philippine and Asian markets but within the mainstream music scene as well.Devotion is gifted not only with great voices but with harmonic talent which is reflected in most of their songs. To this day, my favorite song in this CD is the acapella version of ""When I"" which puts Devotion in the same league as any of today's boy bands. I also like their version of ""More Than Words"" which was first made popular by the group Extreme and also by Eric Clapton.Devotion's passion for singing is what makes this CD worth listening to. All their songs come from the heart."
4,"Dope, yo!","Hey yallz! Their name is smooth to say as their voices. They're a really talented young group. The best one that I really love is ""Need You(By My Side)"". The whole album really kicks! Harmonizing lyrics and soothing voices are truly united in every song! Lots of heartfelt words. It's a true testament of my past relationships. Lots of memories...ahhhh.."
3,stable groom,"Veronica is being a brat again. Anyone surprised? No? Well, this time she is giving Red O'Malley the stablehand a hard time, and the Saddle Club is tired of it. They decide on a plan to get him some certification, in order to gain Veronica's notoriously hard-to-earn respect. Also, they are planning a secret shower for Max, who is engaged. Of course, both plans almost go awry."
2,Very poor casting,"This was my first recording of DonG, from which I learned the opera. So I ought to like it, right? Nope.Ghiaurov is dead wrong for DonG, which is a role for a midrange baritone, not an aging power-bass. His acting is overblown and unfelt at the same time.Franz Crass is bland and boring as the Commendatore, and gets outsung by Ghiaurov.Christa Ludwig is a mezzo. What's she doing trying to sing Donna Elvira???Mirella Freni is too big for Zerlina's role. I don't know why she pretended to be a small singer so often. She's probably only in the cast because she was Ghiaurov's wife.Claire Watson is emotionally unconvincing as Donna Anna.Even Walter Berry is mundane as Leporello.The only good casting decision is Nicolai Gedda as Don Ottavio."
4,from Ohio,The motor is great! i can't imagine trying to make pasta without it. it does make the unit shake if you don't have the right kind of counter top
3,Broke down after 12 uses,"This motor up and died within months of purchasing it. I was using it to roll out noodles and wonton sheets. It started to slow down and then completely stopped running. No overheat, no funny smells or unusual noises, so it's not dead from overwork. I emailed cucinapro to get an RMA but so far, have not heard back. Will keep you posted.UPDATE: The folks at Cucina Pro accepted my broken motor under warranty and sent me a new one in return. Haven't used it yet, but I hope it works as well as it did before."
3,"I don't think ""Anti-Fog"" means what they think it means",I have been using these goggles in an organic chemistry lab and they fog just as badly as the cheapo goggles you can buy from your college bookstore. Forgo the extra couple dollars on these and get some great goggles.
4,Interesting story!,"Interesting story! As expected, it is beautifully filmed, the dialogue is convincing and the actresses are wonderfull - like other Sarah Waters stories. The actresses do a wonderful job in displaying love for one another, despite the lack of love scenes between them. I Really enjoyed the twist in this one, very unexpected! I give it a 4 however, because the end was a bit disappointing. I agree with the previous reviewer in that if you like happy endings movies, this one will likely dissapoint. Overall though, I though it was a very good movie and worth a look."
4,I love Sarah Waters Novels,"I liked this adaptation on a spooky Sarah Waters novel. I am a huge fan of her writing and was a bit disapointed with another adaptation of a previous novel, but this movie did a good job. The movie is a bit spooky without being scary. The viewer can feel the passion and uncertainties that every character expresses even though the story is more rushed than the novel."
2,What it lacks: redeeming value,"Never thought I'd say this: a film with a lesbian subplot that can cure insomnia. I have not read any of Sarah Waters' novels, but this is the third movie I've watched that was based on them and I'm beginning to think that Waters has a poor opinion of women and lesbians (albeit disguised in her smoke and mirrors). In this convoluted suspense story, the female characters are crooks, swindlers, gullible, lonely, controlling, violent, desperate, suicidal -- and in one important scene, sexual molesters. If this was also the novel, then it's a mystery to me how Waters has managed to gain a loyal following of lesbian and feminist readers."
1,Terrible,"This was an awful movie! I am a big fan of Sarah Waters Tipping the Velvet and Fingersmith were excellent! This movie was too short, I could not connect to any of the characters, the directing was bad, and it did not give enough of the story! Don't waste your time or money. Get Tipping the Velvet or Fingersmith."
2,would have been better is not for marketing,"There are three problems with the movie. The first of which is lighting. Ok I know is a victorian prision and it not going be the best lit place in the world, but its also just a movie so realism is not needed. The second is the structure its a bit hard to follow all the flash backs, and some extra footage puting sceans into greating contex would be been welcomed. The third is marking, as the ending shows and if follow the drug use of one main characters, its the story of one most brutal assults I have ever seen. This is what makes the book and movie much better then somthing one would see on American over the air tv or the laughable lifetime nextwork."
5,Synopsis,"""A high-quality, erotic and original short films - with some added hunor! Boys in Love 2, fresh from its theatrical release, features BOOT CAMP, a cross between a leather bar S/M fantasy and an RKO musical; TWILIGHT OF THE GODS, a subtropical period romance between a Maori warrior and a European soldier: KAREN BLACK LIKE ME, a weirdly funny homage to the 70's cult classic Trilogy of Terror: MY BODY, a laugh-out-loud tale about a neurotic but cute young man in denial about his sexual orientation; SPF 2000, a gay spoof of early 70's Italian sexploitation films; and last but certainly not least, DIRTY BABY DOES FIRE ISLAND, a spectacularly animated tale (with some very live action) of sex, drugs and debauchery at our favorite beach hangout! 86 Min color & B/W"" - From Wolfevideo"
5,so bad it's funny,"If this is ""The Best Of Boys In Love"" I'd really hate to see the worst of boys in love. Some of these films are so bad you just laugh. And you're not laughing with them. You're laughing at them. ""Boot Camp"" is so stupid that you'll skip past it halfway through. It's a musical set up in a gay bar. It's funny for about 2 seconds. Then it's time to turn it off. ""Dirty Baby Does Fire Island"" is about a perverted baby doll that comes to life and enjoys watching men having sex. Weird. ""SPF 2000"" is about an alien that comes to earth to put suntan lotion on people's bodies. ""Twilight of the Gods"" is just boring. ""Achilles"" is ok. ""Karen Black Like Me"" is like a Saturday Night Live skit. It's about a monster dildo that attacks a queen. It's pretty funny. ""Death In Venice, CA"" is very good. It's a beautiful love story about a young 17 year old and an older man. It's the only reason why I'm giving this DVD 5 stars. The rest of the films are trash."
2,I should have read the reviews,"I purchased this video recently. I had been interested in it for a while, but had never really heard anything about it other than it was short films with gay themes. Aside from a few cute moments here and there, most of this video was just confusing, boring or down-right ridiculous. Next time I purchase, I will be reading others reviews first."
1,The Best of Boys in Love,The Best of Boys in Love is one of the worst items I've ever purchased. I should have read the reviews on either IMDB or Netflix first.
3,Average 70's Kung-Fu flick,"As far as I can tell, the only thing having to do with Wing-Chun is the title of the movie. It wasn't the worst Kung-Fu movie I've ever seen, but if you're looking for authentic Wing-Chun action, avoid this movie."
4,Winch Chun tonight!,"Great action, deep plot that sometimes may seem a little groggy, but overall a good film. Good quality film, that i truly recommend to anyone who enjoys the genre of martial arts."
1,Descendants of Wing Chun,"This is the absolute worst (martial arts or otherwise) film I've ever had the displeasure of watching. Any viewers should be reimbursed for their time wasted. I would recommend this film to no one. This ""c"" movie had no story line, terrible acting bad correography, and nothing of value to offer viewers. As a Wing Chun practitioner and avid martial arts movie goer, I would like to offer some quality films with skillful actors and great fight scenes. A few are: ""Fist of Legend"", ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"", ""The Legend of the Drunken Master"", ""The Seven Samurai"", and anything by Bruce (strictly for the quality of Bruce's technique and forgiving the cheesiness of the films). Have fun!"
3,Good but not great,"Well this one is a bit weird, it sees to have an identity crisis. Somehow the humour and seriousness just doesn't quite match, just a close inspection of the cover tells all, yes that's an orange in the monks hand. The fight scenes are ok, but nothing great."
4,I'm happy,"I really like the camera and it doesn't hurt to get all the extra stuff with it as well. It's a great camera for regular use and it's pretty easy to use. If i could give it 4.5 stars out of 5 i would, but there's no option for that.My only complaint would be the time it takes to capture a picture. Whenever you take a picture, the camera flashes once, then pauses, then comes a final flash. So by the time the first flash is finished, everyone thinks the picture has been taken, but the second flash actually captures the picture; basically, if everybody moves after the first flash, your picture comes out blurry.Other than that, i'm completely satisfies with this camera! It's my first camera ever, and i'm glad i bought this one."
3,good early evening martini music,great cd if you just want to sit back and relax at sunset with a cocktail or three.girl from ipanema and aruba liberace alone make it worth buying.
4,another solid entry into the sasek collection!,"as with all of m. sasek's books, this comes with the exceptional illustrations he is famous for. the information is plentiful, but in some cases here, a bit too wordy (or at least wordier than his other books). i could see this entry being a bit too much for some children to sit through, even with the wonderful visuals.i also found some of the points of interest in the book to be a bit random (old globe theatre information, anyone?). i happen to enjoy random information, so this was a welcome addition for me, if not a bit strange in parts.and with all the updated printings of sasek's books, there is a welcome list of ""this is the city...today!"" at the end of the book with changes listed since the original printing. it is great to see both the way the city WAS as well as the present day differences.wonderful book!"
4,I love it!!!,It is a very clear CD with a semi-helpful booklet. The CD's are easy to understand and go everywhere I go. Great product at a reasonable price
2,Great for learning random vocabulary... terrible for conversation.,"I only bought this Tagalog program because Pimsleur does not, as of yet, have a Tagalog lesson set. Wow, was I ever disappointed! It just has a person saying each phrase twice and then moves on to the next. There is no continuity to the phrases, nothing conversational about them, and nothing that would serve to cement the information into one's brain. If you can wait until next year, Pimsleur claims they will be coming out with a Tagalog course in the Fall of 2007."
1,One to miss,"Thanks to a mixup on the Amazon server, some reviews of this offering seem to have strayed into the Korean section, with predictable confusion. But in fact this CD (formerly published on cassettes) is of very little use even for people who actually want to learn Tagalog. You can't teach, or learn, a language via recordings of vocabulary lists and simple phrases out of context. Which is all you get here. This material will leave you completely clueless about how to string the words together in anything beyond the preset formulae used here. If you want to find out what a limited number of Tagalog words sound like when read out as lists, this is just about fit for that limited purpose; but there are cheaper (and indeed free) sources of better material for that, which a quick Google will locate. If you have anything more than mild and limited curiosity about this fascinating language, then don't waste your money on this item."
5,We finally found this book again!,"My husband had this book, then lent it out to a neighbor who never returned it. It was the only one of the bunch that the neighbor didn't return when asked. I am sure the neighbor didn't actually lose it; I believe he just didn't want to give it back. Understandable. This is a great book, and is out of print. I have been searching for another copy of this book for years and was so glad to finally find it used at a reasonable price. My husband, an avid gardener, treasures this book."
1,Eye-irritant and greasy,"Sorry L'Oreal, but this stuff makes my eyes red and causes tears each time I apply it, even though I avoid using it around my eyes...Also, it's very greasy, it does not properly absorb into the skin and leaves it very shiny...smell is bearable though...Had to throw it..."
5,TED NUGENT Without a doubt the greatest guitar player ever!,Get this video and learn from the master .also I need a copy of the whip lash bash I haven't been able to locate please if anyone knows where I might get a copy please contact me .
2,Its Ok.,"It is a flash figure. Until DC Comics and Mattel decide to do something along the lines of DC Legends, similar to Toy Biz' Marvel Legends, we have to be thankful for ANYTHING that comes out.Unfortunately, however, there is no detail to this line of figures. The bright side is, they do resemble the animated series, in that it is as 2 dimensional, as a drawing.Nevertheless, since there seems to be a lack of variety in the DC world for reasonablly priced superhero figures, some accolades and applause is deservant for Mattel. We can only hope they drastically improve on the design quality; and, thank them for not gouging us on this line. A much better value than the 4 inch versions."
4,More German dark electronica....,Quite enjoyable dark techno from Germany....surreal and engergetic...with good male vocals....and beautiful packaging...with hidden words on the sleeve...and a surprice of 9 additional hidden tracks. If you likeOptimiertes Leidenor Blutengel...you might like Noyce
2,Cheap -- in more ways than one,"This air horn set is priced at about one third of the cost of a good quality (Hella, Fiamm, etc.) set. Although the set is complete, including mounting brackets and relay, everything appears flimsy and a bit crude. It works as advertised and sounds just like a good Italian horn, but I am curious as to how long it will function before I end up replacing it with a quality horn set."
5,LOUD!,This horn is used on my 2005 Sequioa and its VERY VERY LOUD. Installation was kinda different from my other horns b/c I was just able to plug and play. This Horn I had to cut my stock harness and use the wires to connect to the bottom of the horn housing.
1,NO ClUE,"I seen these guys whenthey opened fir type-o a few years ago, and they pretty much suck live, everyone booed em and thought they sucked. But for some reason i got their first cd, its really not that bad, maybe they had a bad night in clifton park??? no idea, but they still suck live, dont recommened them, they need to come A LONG way before they get good, part of being a good band is being good live. Just found out they have another cd like 2 mins. ago, so ill prob buy it for the hell of it, see if they progressed. so all in all, their first cd is definetly good, and they used ta suck live, other then that, i have no clue"
5,great price,HP is the way to go to replace ink. Store brands do not last as long. This double ink supply is great and so is the price. slek53
1,Expired ink,"I received this item fairly quickly and expected comparable quality in the product as I had received in the shipping. When I attempted to use the ink, however, it was barely better than the empty cartridge I had just removed. Looking at the package, I found the ink had expired in 2009; though the ink was technically ""new"" (unused), it was not in any usable condition. It also arrived with only the inner plastic package (no HP box). Fortunately, this order was fulfilled by Amazon and I was able to return the cartridge for a refund, but I will not be buying from this seller again."
5,Enough ink for a small business and college student,When available and required this particular product goes a long way. I would recommend to anyone trying to save money on ink with high print volumes.
4,Sunhoney: Aidan O'Rourke con un toque el√©ctrico ambiental,"Un descubrimiento este disco de Sunhoney, proyecto musical en el que toman protagonismo el violinista Aidan O'Rourke (en todo el album) y la vocalista Alyth McCormack. Instrumental con algunos temas vocales (aproximadamente al 50% de los temas reunidos)M√∫cia celta evolucionada y contempor√°nea, con matices el√©ctricos, ecos de percusiones. Un sonido ambiental con gran protagonismo de un agil viol√≠n,configuran una sonoridad que es dificil de definir, quiz√° se aproxima a algunos temas instrumentales del rock celta deWolfstone,pero sin estridencias, o al estilo m√°s pr√≥ximo a pop de Capercaillie."
3,not the best introduction to Tim's music,"This is not a very good introduction to the genius that is tim buckley, the quality of the audio is no where near as good as the other two live albums that i own (Dream Letter and Live at the Troubadour). The only good performance on the cd is that of ""I don't want it to rain"".If you want a great live album get either the double CD Dream Letter or Live at the Troubadour.If you want a good introduction to the music of tim buckley, get either Goodbye and Hello or Happy/Sad. Then you can move on to the more adventerous Lorca or the avant garde masterpiece that is Starsailor."
3,"Lovely designs, but infuriatingly misleading","There are many beautiful designs in this book. HOWEVER, the charts are NOT provided for the majority of the loveliest and most interesting designs that are shown in the photographs. This includes (which I find unconscionable) the elegant iris band featured on the front cover! That was the design that prompted me to get the book, but the chart to stitch it is not provided.If you're considering purchasing this book, please find it in a bookstore first, and review it CAREFULLY. Chances are, there will be at least one or two designs in each color category that you'd like to do but cannot, because the charts are not included."
2,Strange..yes..angels..a big no...,"Jonis Agee's ""Strange Angels"" is a nobel attempt to modernize a Western. Set in contemporary Nebraska(Cherry county to be precise), the story follows the contempestous relationship between three siblings(Cody, Arthur and Kya). They all have a different mother, but the same father: recently deceased rancher Haywood Bennett. The novels follows their changing lives as Arthur tries to steal an attractive widow away from Cody, Kya tries to be less selfish(and man hungry), and their Indian friend Joseph tries to steer them along(he's the best character in the novel easily). Too slow for my tastes, and overly melodramatic with a hero that drinks A LOT. Only merits 2 stars."
3,Pears Ultimate Quiz Companion,"This is a great general knowledge reference book.Easy to look up subjects help make it a book to pick up at any time,choose a subject and learn in a relaxed fashion.Plenty of variety,fascinating trivia,sport,theatre entertainment to name but a few topics.A must for anyone interested in quizes of any nature or simply gathering trivia."
5,book,"i haven't even had a chance to read this book. however, it has lots of good b&w photos. makes an ideal coffee table book."
3,Batteries not included,"The box sent by Amazon doesn't contain batteries. The same company does offer boxes containing the batteries, but the ones offered by Amazon do not have them. People buying other products from other sites should refrain from commenting on these issues, unless they are sure. Based on these comments I purchased the item at Amazon assuming it a good deal, which it wasn't."
1,doens't work,We purchased this last Christmas. We didn't realize it required the separate purchase of 2 batteries. We bought the batteries for $30. The car didn't work. We exchanged it for another box. We finally got around to opening the new box and it doesn't work either. We tried the new battery and a battery from another remote car which works. It still doesn't work!
4,Batteries ARE Included,"This remote controlled car is a lot of fun. The front axle works in an unusual way that makes the car do flips and other tricks. It has a tight turn radius that makes it work well indoors.As far as what the previous reviewer said about the batteries, it's not true. I own one of these, and it actually came with the nicad battery for the car, a charger, AND the 9 volt battery for the remote. At the discount price, it's a really good deal."
1,Does Not work & No Batteries,"After I received the car, we realized that we have to spend $25 for the 6V recharchable battery and the 9V battery. Then the car was a lot of fun but only one day then died. Tried re-charging, and other battries with no luck."
1,I should have read the reviews before buying!,Hopefully others will take the time to read the reviews prior to buying and learn from the mistake I made. I neglected to read that the batteries required for this toy are VERY hard to find and expensive.
1,Crazy Taxi no bargain,"The front fender comes off with the slightest bump and nowhere is it indicated that you will have to purchase a rechargeable battery at about three times the cost of the car, so with shipping, this item comes in above the cost of purchasing a radio controlled car at Radio Shack or a toy store."
1,very displeased,This remote control car came without a battery pack. Pretty worthless to us now. I don't understand why that would be. My daughter was extremely disappointed
1,READ THE REVIEWS,"I too am caught up in the battery problem. I actually went back to the site to look up how to get the battery to find the reviews all talked about the problem. I guess that is why reading the reviews is so important. It is quite embarrassing when it is a gift. I give all gifts with the necessary batteries, however, this one needed much more than a 9volt."
4,That's Entertainment,"Somehow I thought that this was a kareoke CD. Is there one? I really would like to have the instrumentals. Thank you, Lynn Knudsen"
4,from a Third Eye Blind fan,"When you first start the cd, it grabs at you.They are sure to become this cd's bread and butter.I've come to notice that musicians are at their bestthrough the pain they endure in their daily lives.It's hard not to wonder if Stephan Jenkins public break-upwith actress Charlize Theron didn't play a major role in the over-all feel to the cd.Out of the Vein has the vibe that it is made up of their debut cdand blue, giving the audience the catchiness from the first and the classic rock on Blue.Overall, it is a great cd.I would still have to say that thierfirst cd is still the best."
5,3EB...keep doing what you're doing,"we've been waiting for this album for about four years, and people let me tell you, 3eb in no way disappointed me. Every song on the album, with the exceptions of #'s 3 and 7, are tight. Those two songs aren't bad, but they're just too simple. My favorite is ""Palm Reader"". The rhythm of the song makes you want to sing along. I drive an hour every day to school, and I listen to the whole cd without any complaints. ""Can't get away"" is a perfect song also. 3EB, please don't change!"
5,Brilliant!,"For any fans of Third Eye Blind's older albums, I highly suggest this one. The songs are in the old 3EB style, but they aren't at all repetative. A must have! :)"
1,It is NOT the same after KEVIN CADOGAN Left !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This CD is awful...out of the vein should have not even went out on the market! I would give this no stars if it wasnt for one ok song ""crystal baller"". Please let Kevin back in the band so we can get the OLD 3EB BACK! This isn't anything like the first awsome self-titled CD and Blue was much better than this one! I use to be a proud fan of 3EB and it is all over after Kevin got kicked out! Good luck Kevin Cadogan on your new band i hope you make it big so you can flip off Sephen Jenkins'suxy azz band!"
2,Unoriginal - Rehash of previous work,"First of all I don't dislike 3EB, but I have to say their new CD is junk. I haven't listen to the whole CD yet, and I don't need to. This CD is trash. Every single song has the same upbeat and annoying rifts. It's only after the first 30 seconds of each song and the display on your CD player that you know what song you are on because EVERY song starts out the same way.3EB needs to have more than one idea for a song before they release a CD because rehashing the same one over and over again isn't going to sell very many CD's. It's no wonder they haven't had a hit song in awhile--people are tired of listening to the same old stuff about the same old things with the same old melodies. And that is exactly what this is, a rehash of songs and melodies that we have all heard before...C'mon guys you can cetainly do better than this"
1,out of the mind,this album is SHEER BULL CRAP!!!!! it is all just screeches. the only remotely good song is blinded which got overplayed. 3eb is not good.
3,"Bought it for ""Blinded""","I've stopped downloading and started buying; the unfortunate side effect of that is sometimes you'll get a CD that is really only worth the one song you bought it for. Blinded is a great song; which unfortunately outshines the rest of the songs on this CD. Some of the others are pretty good, but the CD as a whole was disapointing. ""Blue"" is a much better CD as a whole.This CD just hasn't grown on me like the Stroke 9 CDs and the Coldplay CDs I bought with it. If I had to do it all over again I would still get it because it IS entertaining and 'pretty good'... but it wouldn't be my first choice. Hope that helped."
3,Nothing Special,"I love their first two cds and i eagerly anticipated this one. But as the release date kept getting pushed further and further back i worried. That's never a good sign. Still when the album came out I bought it. On your first listen to the cd nothing sticks out. Play it again while going through the lyrics and it has a couple good songs in the beginning like: Blinded and Faster. Even Forget Myself is alright. But after that the album just drags. All the songs start to sound the same. If you want to hear good, catchy Third Eye Blind songs pick up their self-titled album and Blue."
3,"Good album, could have been better.....","First off, no matter what, Third Eye Blind will always be one of my favorite bands. Within 5 minutes of hearing that this album was released, I ran to get my hands on a copy. At first, it seemed to me like the album was a bit dry. None of the lyrics really gripped me. But after listening a couple more times, the songs started to grow on me. Im totally loving the mellow, yet upbeat feel of Crystal Baller. These guys are pros at catchy choruses. And tracks like Can't get Away, and bllinded are typical 3EB hits. I was a little dissapointed with the absence of those awesome wah solos that were a Third Eye blind trademark. But overall, this album is worth picking up. It's defiently not on par with the debut album, but you've you've been dying for some new material from 3EB, this one should be a welcome addition to your collection."
2,A Vein Attempt at Former Greatness,"After the blazing success of their first CD and Blue, Out of the Vein is a real let-down. Gone are the innovation and poetic creativity that drove their first two CDs. It is clearly apparent that the departure of Kevin Cadogan has bled this band dry of it's artistic capabilities. Instead the band must now rely on un-inspired heavy metal and cheap gimics like a free DVD in order to sell music. Thus ends yet another short lived but great chapter in the anals of Rock...not with a bang but a wimper."
2,I'm an old 3EB fan,"I bought this cd simply because I love Third Eye Blind, and I still do love the band despite this new effort. Listen to it before you buy it, don't buy it on spec like I did. The problem is not that their talent has disappeared, but that it's a flat recording. I don't feel the umph that I require from a song. It sounds like they beat it to death in the recording studio, and lost the emotion of the words somewhere along the way.I was so surprised that I switched players to make sure my speakers weren't screwed up. It wasn't the speakers. In well thought out lyrics and sounds, somewhere it died for me. It seems from the other reviews that many people disagree with me, but my recommendation is to listen to this cd somehow before you purchase it. I was disappointed. Perhaps I should see them live to find their spirit, because I don't think it made it to cd."
3,Craving The Once Subtle Genius of Third Eye Blind,"OOTV has certainly grown on me in the two years I've had it. There's definitely enough good stuff on there to call it an above average record, and I commend 3eb for that. And maybe if this was the first album instead of the third, it would be on my list of top 5 favorite albums of all time. But that's the problem. Third Eye Blind's first two albums were for a lack of a better world absolutely incredible, and OOTV simply can't compete. When it comes down to it, they've lost something. It could be the signature sound of Kevin Cadogan; it could be that this album is just overprocessed; it could be the fact that Stephan Jenkins is just getting older. All I know is I'm craving the band I heard for the first time way back in '97, that ballsy, aggressive, power pop that none of us could forget. Buy this album; it's worth it. But for something that will truly touch you, Blue and Self-titled."
5,Out of this world...,If that's how his album sounds like after breaking up with Charlize Theron than he needs to get back with her and break up again and then make another album...
4,Buy it,"In regard to the editor's review I believe the CD is incredible. I am an extreme fan of 3EB. I went to one of their concerts on the ""Within Arms Reach"" tour which hit small clubs in the nation. While this CD can still not touch their first self-titled debut, I believe it is better than ""Blue"", even though Blue in itself is amazing as well. If you are a fan of Third Eye Blind, or just like alternative in general, get this CD."
4,Awesome Surprise,"Still studiofied, but a great return to 3eb's roots. I love this cd. it is emotional, but in a different way than the other cds. this seems to deal mostly with stephen jenkin's life and youth. a great cd, and the extra-dvd is a awesome bonus."
4,Consistent 3EB,"I agree with the other reviewers who say that this CD does not depart from the 3EB formula. But that is a formula I happen to like, and this album is another strong application of it. You can see Jenkins' rapping talents in his lyrics - there's some really great rhyming on this disc.One minor note, the track listing above is way off. Here's the right one:1. Faster2. Blinded3. Forget Myself4. Danger5. Crystal Baler6. My Hit and Run7. Misfits8. Can't Get Away9. Wake for Young Souls10. Palm Reader11. Self Righteous12. Company13. Good Man"
2,I expected more....,"When Third Eye Blind released their first major label CD, I was impressed with the introspective lyrics matched with memorable hooks -- they made the CD an almost permanent part of my changer's rotation. I said that after that collection, I would not hesitate to buy anything they put out. I bought the next one (Blue) the week it came out, and I felt like it was a huge step down -- not bad, but nowhere near the first.I am sorry to report that Out of the Vein hits a new low. Sure, the tracks are still marked with a personal tone, but at times this tone hits the depressing and painful. What is really lost, though, is the originality of the first -- most of this disc seems recycled and rehashed; in many cases, I thought I was hearing missing parts of songs from the first two CD's. There are a few exceptions, but they are few and far between, and I am rethinking my status as a 3EB fan with every poor effort that comes into stores from them."
5,Best Third Eye Blind release yet,"Out of The Vein is without question the best Third Eye Blind CD to date. The lyrics are smart, interesting and meaningful and this band has perfect chemistry and sound. Every song is awesome!!"
5,Wonderful,"I can't believe it...3EB shows another side of themselves again. Firstly, though, who was not in awe of the wonderful tunes and stream-of-conscious lyrics of their original self-titled debut? Then, they release Blue. What an absoulte charm - absolutely deep, dark, humorous, soulful, and highly intricate. On the first CD, Motorcycle Driveby delivered every essence of 3EB's original work. On Blue, songs like Deep Inside of You and An Ode to Maybe, those wonderful works of modern rock music, again unveil 3EB's originality. For Out of the Vein, Third Eye Blind combines flavors and themes from both of their previous CDs and work out an unbelieveable blend that not only draws heavily from the structure of their previous work but also builds new platforms for their music. Songs such as Danger and Crystal Baller are extremely well done, and Palm Reader and Misfits reveal another highly complex side of 3EB.This is a wonderful CD!"
2,Slit a Vein,"Out of the Vein is great...if you can't sleep and want something to put you out fast! Whoever says it takes some getting used to was partially correct. I'm already used to changing the station when their first single plays on the radio. Steven Jenkins is not ""interesting when he's wounded."" He sounds [bad]. Out of the Vein seems to be missing something the first two GREAT albums had...could it be fired guitarist Kevin Cadogan? Skip the album, and if you still want to spend money on Third Eye Blind, go to one of their concerts...oh, and a word of advice--the best time to make a run towards the concession stands is when they start playing songs from Out of the Vein."
2,Gone Soft,"Yes, the CD may have some good lyrics; yes, some songs may be catchy, but I remember Third Eye Blind as a band that rocked. I was thoroughly disappointed to find a CD lacking in anything resembling a good straight up rock song, such as 1000 Julys or Narcolepsy. Buy this CD if you're more a fan of the introspective, ""deep"" Third Eye Blind, but don't expect any songs you can drive to."
2,i'm glad this is a limited edition,"one of my favorite bands from way back when was undeniably third eye blind- making their self titled album one of my most treasured cds. however, this album is way to drowny its missing any form of melody whatsoever and it sounds like 3EB wasn't even enthusiastic about any of these songs. this cd is lacking all of the essential ingredients that they worked so hard to put in for their first album, and then not so much with blue (but enough) but there is an immesurable amount in Out of the vein (maybe just traces of their once good side). its missing all the spunk and anything really important. the best song is crystal baller and that is only so-so, the dvd is interesting but i really wouldn't have paid $18 just for that."
2,Lazy Rehash,"Loved the first two albums. This one sounded like reprocessed tracks from those. Occasional moments give enough pop rock energy for 10 listens. Then the dread sets in: these songs not only sound like each other, they sound like pale versions of what this band (when it had a much better guitarist) was doing 7 years ago, and you are never going to listen to this album again."
5,CDNOW Track Listing Is Way Off,"Has anyone else noticed that the track listing above is WAY OFF. not only do they have tracks that aren't even on the CD, they don't have tracks that ARE on the CD.. and they have tracks in the wrong order. has anyone else noticed this?this CD is amazing - everyone will love BLINDED immediately - and Crystal Baller. After a few listens, you will be able to appreciate the craftsmanship of all the other tracks as well. FASTER and FORGET MYSELF are so wonderful."
5,"Out of the Vein, Into greatness","I am a big Third Eye Blind Fan. I really liked their last CD Blue. This one is extremely good, even better than Blue. My personal favorite songs are Faster, Crystal Baller, and Wake for Young Souls. I recommend this if you enjoy rock without the emo, and punk. It's hard to write a review for a CD because it's all a matter of opinion, and my opinion is that this is the best Third Eye Blind CD yet."
5,Amazing album and no credit at all,Third Eye Blind shines on this album. The CD is just as good as their debut album and thanks to the world of downloading music - the band will not get the credit they deserve. This CD is masterful and filled with amazing lyrics yet again. Even the song on the DVD is phenomenal and could have easily made this CD. I highly recommend this CD to anyone looking for a good CD beginning to end - something many other bands simply cannot do.
3,Heartbreak City.,"Out of the Vein by Third Eye Blind is a very serious album documenting the break-up of lead singer Stephan Jenkins's break-up with Charlize Theron. The songs here are personal and raw to the bone. Songs I enjoy include: Blinded (When I See You), Crystal Baller, Forget Myself, Misfits, and My Hit and Run. I like this album but it is not as strong as their debut album. Interesting album to listen to if you are going through a rough break-up."
4,Refined - and that's a good thing,"If you liked Third Eye Blind's previous two albums then you will likely enjoy this as well. The band has taken their strongest characteristics and refined them into an excellent blend of the pulsing high energy rock that is the core of their greatness. If you only liked the experimental and fringe tracks from the previous releases then you will be disappointed, but if like most people you want more of the kinds of songs ""Semi-Charmed Life"" from their self titled album or the unreleased ""Camouflage"" from Blue then this album is for you."
5,Wow,"I can't believe it took me this long to get around to hearing this CD (some 4.5 years since its release). In short, its excellent. I am a huge fan of 3EB's first cd and I liked their 2nd cd but it really took a long time for that one to grow on me. Out of the Vein reminds me very much of their first album in that it hooks you straight away. I'm even tempted to say this one is as good if not better than their first album. Its that good. The sound that the band came up with for this album is great. Everything has a lot of depth to it and the songs have a greater amount of backup vocals than the ones from the earlier cds. Very well arranged and cool sounding. Every song on the cd is good with the exception of ""Self Righteous"". The female vocalist in that song sings off key and the song doesn't keep with the vibe of the rest of the album. If that song would have been left on the cutting room floor this would have been pretty much a perfect album."
2,Third Eye Bomb,"I have a compilation CD of the 3EYEBs best 10 songs that always stays in my truck's CD mag. I won't add any songs from this album. The spirit and lyrics that exploded in the first album began to dissipate in the second is hanging by a thread. This album sounds like a band trying to imitate what 3EYEB once was. Musically the songs are very similar. Gone are the intricate lyrics interwoven with guitars that crisscrossed effortlessly between powerful and haunting passages. If you love this band, my advice is to skip this album and hope they find whatever it is they lost."
3,Bleh,"I really liked Third Eye Blind's previous work, but this was a disappointment to me. Somehow they've lost that captivating feel."
2,Third Eye's New Effort,"What can I say...this was a great band who lost a great guitar player as well as the ability to write a SOLID album. Don't get me wrong there are a few highlights on this album like catchy tune""Blinded (when I see you) and the flat out rocker ""Crystal Baller"" (my fav) but other than that the songs don't do much for me. Sorry maybe their next album will be better, or maybe I'll change my mind but for now it only gets 2 stars."
4,Not bad. Not bad at all.,"Almost as good as their self - titled debut album, 'Out of the Vein' offers an amazing new array of tracks since their last, relatively unremarkable 'Blue' of 1999. The quality compared to 'Blue'? A vast improvement, indeed. If you liked their first album - pick it up."
3,This album is okay,"There are two points I'd like to cover before I start this review. One is that if you use the ""F"" word a total of two times on your album, then you don't need an EXPLICIT CONTENT sticker. The other thing is, does anyone even care that this album is out?All arguments aside, this album can basically be described as ""just okay"". The first single, ""Blinded (When I See You)"" is decent, but there aren't are any standouts to the likes of, say, ""10 Days Late"" or ""How's It Gonna Be"". Also, there are a few missteps, like ""Can't Get Away"" and the hard-to-get-into ""Self Righteous"".I was about to say this album is better than Blue, but then I heard some other tracks that made me hold that remark. ""Company"" is really unbalanced (listen to the song to understand what I mean), and ""Danger"" kind of sounds like a rejected Blink-182 song.There's not much else to say about Out of the Vein, except that it's too bad it's not getting out of the STORE.Anthony Rupert"
4,a landmark for 3eb,"This is an excelent cd by third eye blind. Althought the awsome guitarist from their best cd, self-entiteled, was not with them on this one made it a bit less than what it could have been. Still, the lyrics were excelent and all the songs fit well into each other except for a few. blinded, and crystal baller are most likely sure favorites to any one who buys this but instead of listening to those on repeat, listent to the whole thing. I found one of my favorite songs of all time on this cd ""can't get away"". all around this cd is pretty great"
5,they're back!,"Great band returns with a great new album. You gotta check out these tracks, if you were a fan before this will make you a fan all over again.Check out the 3EB official website. Congradulations to all the band members for an awesome album."
4,Interesting,"Overall, the album flows very well from song to song. Very instrumental at times, but always emotional; songs such as ""My Hit and Run"" incorporate both. This is a very good album, not as catchy as their first, but much more honest, and I think that makes it very good."
5,Been in my car for 6 months,"This record is much better than Blue. I encourage you to go to Third Eye Blind.net and get the lyrics for Crystal Baller, My Hit and Run (one of their best) and Palm Reader. These are awesome songs, and I have not take this out of my car since I got it last year. I am vey much looking forward to their long awaited EP which I hear should be out this year. The Third Eye Blind.net site has some cool demos you can listen to as well. Check out One of Those Christmas Days while you are there."
2,Not their best,"This album does not compare to their previous two releases. ""Out of the Vein"" sounds rushed. I was extremely disappointed with this release. I love 3eb...i know Steven Jenkins can't sing LIVE worth you know what, but i expected alot better. Maybe the 4th album will blow all of these out of the water?"
2,not worth it,My salon charges an extra dollar for this product and though it may dry the top of the enamel it does not dry through all coats 3 hours after my pedicure I needed to put heels on and my pedicure was ruined. My nails were still wet 3 HOURS later How is that a quick dry.
3,French reality-TV star crafts slick pop album,"Nolwenn is one of the bigger stars on the French pop scene right now. She's sold a ton of albums over there-- but you might take that with a grain of salt...after all, we're talking about the nation that idolizes Johnny Halliday. Here, she tries to cultivate a Kate Bush sound. The single from this album, NOLWENN OHWO, is certainly beguiling. But it won't hold up under repeated listenings. She's sort of the Kelly Clarkson of France-- good production, mediocre songs, short shelf-life. Actually, her songs are much better than Kelly Clarkson's pablum. But it's still commercial pop product. With a French accent. You make the call."
4,Shares printers wireless/wired reliably. Not for digital pix,"Got this on sale cheap and put several printers onto wired ports on my Linksys WRT54G home WLAN. The quick-start info is all you need for setup. Works ok under Win XP Pro & Linux Fedora 3 provided printer is powered on before you need it; otherwise an incomplete file is sent and you get pages of garbage from Postscript printers at least. Windows gives useless feedback on print failures, so be prepared for frustration. Note: this has a Centronics-type connector not USB, so is slow for big (digital camera) files. But fine for text and Web graphics."
1,Bad product support,"I set up everthing according to the Quick install. All setting is correct but i still could not print. I call Technical support,on hold for 20 minuts then told me he was not the right support agent. Back in the loop i go . wait for 30 more minutes 2nd agent told me the same thing. Don't waste your time calling thier support. if it work out of the box great if not return it don't waste ur life like i did."
3,Lack the hardware reset button,"It lacks a hardware RESET button. Maybe I should give it a four star, because you may not need it at all. For example, if you set a password, and then forget it, it will never ever be recovered, and you cannot change its configuration forever. And it is an expensive unit (about $60)."
5,D-LINK DP-301p+ FANTATSTIC DEVICE,"This item works really well. I have 4 pc's at my home, and they all are networked. With this D-link device, I am able to print from any PC, wired or wireless. This Dlink print server was very simple to install, and i would recommend it to anybody. The only drawback with this device is that it doesnt have a reset button, so when you first configure this device, MAKE SURE YOU REMEMBER ITS IP ADDRESS AND PASSWORD, if you gave it one. THANKS AMAZON!!"
4,that worked..,ok i was getting this for my printer to work with our server and that definitely solved my problem.. haven't had any problems since..
1,Bad product plus bad technical support,"This product and support is better to close shop asap to prevent further loses. The lady support I spoke to was not only limited in knowledge, she was arrogant and not user-friendly. I was feeling real good until I went through this lousy excercise, I have to take my hearth medicine to calm me down."
3,"It worked great, until I fried it","The power jack for this print server is exactly the same as the power jack for my HP printer - except that my printer takes 18 volts and the print server takes 5 volts. Just once, when I moved the printer, both power cords fell out. Unfortunately, I swapped them when I plugged them back in. It didn't take me long for me to recognize my mistake, but by then it was too late. The print server hasn't worked since."
4,"Works great but no reset button, requires TCPIP knowledge","This is a good print server, but it doesn't have a reset button. I was finally able to figure out what the previous tech had set the IP to by scanning old printer definitions in Windows -- without that info, I might as well throw it away.It works better than the DP-311P (all wifi, not stable with all routers) because it has a cable connection to the router. You're going to have to know some basic TCPIP theory to set it up: make sure its IP is in your router's DHCP range, reserve that IP address in the router. And before you do that, you'll need to manually set your computer's IP to within a few digits of the print server's IP, just to connect so you can configure it. But once you've got it working, it's pretty bullet proof."
5,D-Link DP-301P+ 10/100,"My network card in my printer recently stopped working. Instead of changing the internal network card, I decided to get this print server instead and installed it and worked like a charm."
4,D-Link Print Server,"I purchesed a Dell E520. The Dell has no LPT1 port. I own a Canon BJ200e that needs a LPT1 port. The D-Link DP-301P+ print server works very will and solved the problem of no LPT1 port. The only down side is the instructions are a bit hard to understand if you are not a full out computer geek. However, I got though it and it works will."
1,"paid for a ""new"" CD, and got a ""used"" CD","i was extremely disappointed when i received my christopher goze CD in the mail only to discover that i was sent a ""used"" CD when i paid for a ""new"" CD. would not use this seller ever again, and NOT recommend anyone else using them either."
3,Do not be deceived,"The colors of the item are not as they appear in this picture. The only real gold color (as it appears here) are the two circular lines at the top and bottom. Most of the gold painting is a very muted gold or brown. Thje vase arrived in good condition even though it is misrepresented. I had no contact with the seller. Be that as it may, I kept the item, but I am surprised at the misrepresentation."
2,Book is too small to capture the true cover art,"I was very disapointed after receiving this book. I have an extensive Superman book collection and looked forward to this item. I purchased it online and did not realize how small the book actually is (approximately 3"" x 4""). The size does not do justice to the cover art work."
2,Very small,This book is incredibly small. Quite a let down when I received it. Think twice before buying this book .
3,Appreciate,I can appreciate the work put into the book. I took the book for it's writing style to give me a how to guide and what not to do. The book is so dense that it could not cover everything. The author was left to decide what was important and the information that is important to him is not important to me. The book was a requirement for a course so we could get background information of higher ed and I can definitely appreciate it's purpose.
2,Very silly. The years haven't been kind to this musical,The song and dance numbers cannot rescue this musical from the silly plot and weak characters. The film goes nowhere. I found it hard to identify with the characters and thus very hard to watch. Perhaps a disk that had only the songs and the dances?
5,Great CD!,I love Elizabeth's album. She has a great voice and the songs she wrote are the best. I just saw her perform live at the Mall of America and she was even better in person than on the CD if that's possible. I think she will have a great future in music.
3,Good but Very Dated,"I went to Montreal for a week in 1998 with this and one other guidebook. While the organization and contents are all great, there were way too many listings that were non-existant. So, while it's useful for helping you understand neighborhood, DO NOT rely on it for specific restaurant and business listings. One night I went out for dinner and the first three listings I went to out of the book were no longer there!"
2,Decent Picture But No Zoom,"For the price this is a decent LCD, it looks nice, has a good picture, excellent variety of inputs but it also has a lousy remote and at least one major flaw that ruins it for me. The LT32HVE, and it seems all the LCDs from Syntax, lacks a zoom function to make 4:3 letterboxed sources fill the screen, ie anything shown widescreen on SD cable or broadcast TV as well as some DVDs, VHS and VCDs. You either have to watch with bars on all 4 sides of the picture or stretch the picture to fit the width, leaving the bars top and bottom unchanged and distorting the image. Also, the Olevia logo is very bright blue when the TV is off so it's not good for in a bedroom, unless you like sleeping with a night light."
4,what a great deal for a great product,"and to think when my friend asked me whether he should get this over a samsung LCD after my original response of ""syntax who?"" I suggested the samsung. of course, there is NOTHING wrong with getting a samsung, but that question led me to NUMEROUS great reviews from all over the web and my question ultimately answered with my own purchase of this TV. Great value (...) for the money. It is missing a few conveniences from other brands like detachable speakers and a decent menu system... but working off of a solid LG LCD panel with great specs I am throughly impressed with this TV."
5,Can't beat price w/ rebate. TV is amazing!,"I just got my unit on Dec 15, 2005. I was really worried that there would be dead pixels or some problem, but the unit worked like a charm right out of the box. We don't have HDTV cable service yet, but SDTV looks fine and DVDs look unbelievable. Its still early days, but unless something goes wrong technically, I'm sold on Syntax Olevia. With rebate and shipping included, $720.00 for a 32"" HD-ready LCD? Great deal!"
4,Very pleased with this LCD,"I purchased this TV based on a rebate and its great specs, plus I have heard good things about the brand.Without a doubt this is a wonderful LCD. I use it as my main TV and as a computer monitor for my HTPC and for gameing. It is impressive. No ghosting, colors are right on, black levels are very good. The Auto Adjust feature is perfect, I've sync'd the screen to work on every game, DVD display and TV display. Only problem I have with the TV is the corners have a light affect to them. Difficult to explain, but at the corners there is a cone of dull white light, only noticable when the screen is on a dark scene.Overall however, due to the great price I am happy with this purchase and would buy this brand LCD again"
2,Great review till Warranty Fiasco,"The TV was great then started to deteriorate i.e. sharpness constantly deteriorates and needs adjustment, brightness flutters and picture flickers.The so called onsite warranty means thier site, 3000 miles away. If I wanted immediate fixing I would have had to freeze the retail price on a credit card, then an exchange would have taken place. I opted to wait for onsite/inhome and that was 2.5 months ago.A report to the BBB resulted in a replacement promise because ""the needed part(video ship) is still not available.When working the TV is up there with the top of the line. If not, headache city."
2,Too many tracks by Peaches,"Based on how often Peaches appears on this double-album (four times, three more than any other artist), you'd think she was a driving force of Electroclash. She is not. Some of the usual big names are present, but all with older material.There are a few good entries onto this mix which are from artists unknown to me, but what I find most enjoyable on this album are remixes of material I'm already familiar with. Far too many of the tracks I don't think are very good, or even fit within the genre of Electroclash.If you can grab it cheap, or you're a die-hard, then this is worth it. But otherwise, select a different compilation."
4,The Deal of the Century!,"I,honestly, thought the price must be a misprint.What a fantastic collection of operas for a nominal price! Top drawer singers,conductors,costumes and scenery.My favorites are the ""Cosi Fan Tutti"" and ""Attila"". Fiordiligi & Dorabella's entrance duet is breathtaking. Samuel Ramey's Attila is legendary.His voce is so full of excitement and passion.I am a great fan of Renato Bruson.However, he succeeded in destroying the beauty of the sextet from Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor. The projected scenery in the William Tell was unusual. Mirella Freni's Adriana was very moving. Her beauty of tone was phenomenal for her age. Great performances across the board. A wonderful acquisition for the novice or jaded opera enthusiast."
5,Spectacular Opera From La Scala,"Not only are the performances top-notch, but the production values exceed what one has grown to expect from operas on DVD. Each opera in this collection conveys the feeling (almost) of sitting in the audience.This collection was recommended by a friend who works in opera. He not only is a talented producer, but is very close with his euros. I was about to order an opera DVD which cost most of what I paid for this entire set!First Class Opera at a bargain basement price."
5,A treasure at a bargain price,"This is a superlative collection of live opera transmissions from the most important opera house in the world, La Scala. The Lucia and the Due Foscari are among my favorites. Superb voices, gorgeous settings and sumptuous costumes. Verdi's Attila is seldom mounted, and this is a chance to witness this very exciting opera in a monumental production. I count this as a most important section of my operatic video library.Patrick C. ByrneCALLAS Corner"
5,i love opera,"although i have not viewed all the operas in the collection,those that i have seen are excellent.i am sure when i have viewed the rest i will feel the same way."
4,Opera on DVD,"As lovers of opera, my wife and I are finding that the choice, price and quick delivery of the DVDs we order from Amazon, give us a fantastic opportunity to watch opera regularly at an affordable price.The La Scala collection of 11 operas plus the Wagner I am now buying makes the Amazon site one we visit regularly.And we look forward to receiving regular parcels."
1,Dull La Scala,I've been an opera fan since the 1950s and have seen and heard many performances. This collection is DULL! Richardo Muti conducts the orchestra as if he were half asleep. The singing is at a tempo that does not interest or excite. I was very disappointed. Don't waste your money on this collection.
1,El Misterio del Tercer Planeta,Bad video transfer and bad dubbing. Movie is good but incompetently transferred. I would suggest you look for another version of this film.
4,Perry Farrel vs. Lush,This is a pretty good album actually. Good to just put on and have playing in the background. Good Summer music.But it totally sounds like it would've been released 10 or 15 years ago. It makes me think of Perry Farrel singing for that band Lush with a little bit of Sigur Ros thrown in the background here and there....
4,"Adopted, rescued? Must-have!","This is a great book if you have adopted or rescued any Parrot. Invaluable information and tips. I was surprised, and learned several new ways to help my Parrot adapt quickly, calmly, and with pleasure for all parties! Falsely labeled a biter, he got a bad rap. You, too, may have a secretly sweet-natured Parrot!"
5,Great Resource,"I adopted two budgies from my local shelter. This is a great book to help you understand the behavior of any companion parrot and it also lets you know up front what you are getting into when you take on a parrot of any species. Good information to have PRIOR to taking on the exotic animals. I may just stick with my two budgies but if I do end up adopting more and bigger birds later, I know I've got a great book to refer back to and this was after reading it cover to cover."
5,good info on the relationship between Humans and parrots,I bought this book because a neighbor of mine wanted to get rid of her mealy amazon who's age is unknown but is apparently older than 35 years or more of age. Well to shorten the story my neighbor changed her mind when I asked if I could take him into my care but this book in my opinion has very good insight on how to better understand and take care of our already established parrot we own. Reading the stories that The Second Hand parrot provides has help me learn from others mistake and misunderstanding of parrots to be able to really care for my Ruby.
2,Not too great,"While all of the music is good, there are only a few well know songs so I feel it was a big waste of a lot of money."
5,DooWop Box,Wonderful collection! Waited all my life for this and finally got it for a great price! Excellent selection for avid doowop collectors!
5,Fabulous obscurities,"Because all of the really famous songs went into the first Doo Wop Box, the selection here runs to the obscure but very deserving regional hits that in many cases are superior to the ""hits"". Many of the cuts here I never heard before this, and they really have to rate among my all-time favorites now. One of the best music purchases I have ever made!"
5,Breathtakingly Honest - Really Made Me Think,"This is indeed a story that explores the deep racial divide that saw many blacks flee from South to North in search of better lives in the 1920s. However, Ms. Williams Newsome's true historical account focuses on the overt adversity and discrimation that the pioneers and their descendents experienced upon settling in the North. The author's sparkling detail of her characters made me feel as if I knew them and that I was right there in the midst. This book is a winner - recommended for young and elderly."
5,HOBBSTWON- GREAT READING,"In reading Cindy William Newsome's book "" Hobbstown,"" it comes to life like watching a movie. One chilling scene in the book is so real and touching and heart breaking is when Sista's parent's are murdered. Ten years later Sista is chased by a mob of white'shunting her down like a wild animal. She has to flee because she's accused of something she didn't do. She flees for her lifeand that of her un-born child, but hatered prevailed and Sista and her un-born child were murdered. This broke my spirit, how could one human being be so cruel towards another. Cindy Newsome's writing is crisp and her writing of the history of an era when hatred towards black people and the sadness is no one stood up to stop the madness. I applaud and I do recommend foreveryone to read her book. I give her 5 *****Joseph Frank Baraba"
1,Not recommended,"The instructions make this appear like a relatively fool-proof process, which it is not. They warn you about smearing adhesive on the screen, when they should warn you that the screen is extremely fragile and the least bit of pressure on it will crack it and render the iPod useless."
4,better than the original,"The battery works as advertised. Replacement was fairly easy, specially with the included tools. Expect to do the swap in about 20 minutes. The ""spudger"" tool can be of better quality, but for the price of the whole kit - it works just fine."
1,Took my money and ran,"I ordered a iPod Mini replacement battery. When I got it, I opened it to find no battery, just an empty box.I called their ""Customer Service"" number well within the business hours, but each time I got the same recording saying to call back business hours. I called servile times starting at 9am but only got the ""you have called after business hours"" recording. When I did get in contacted with them, they said ""sorry, you took too long to contact us.""So I guess ""Batteries NOT Included"" with this replacement battery.They have a nice set,1. Take your money.2. Send you an empty box3. Not answer the phone or email.4. Tell you ""you should have contacted us earlier"""
4,Does what it says on the tin,"The battery works well, and replacement was a breeze with the video to follow. Yay for giving new life to an old pod we were going to toss out as a goner.The prying tool could be a bit better though. The soft plastic quickly lost it's edge, and thus any use as a prying device."
5,A book worth searching the earth for...,"I've been preparing authentic Chinese dishes from this book for over 20 years now. In fact, this is my second copy - I wore the original out after years of use and was lucky enough to get a second copy at a low-traffic book store. This book is so authentic, you'll have some real challenges finding and properly preparing the ingredients. But of course that is part of the fun, too. And oh what a sense of accomplishment when you serve your first Chinese feast and get rave reviews! Good Luck finding a copy - and good eating if you succeed!"
4,Madame Wong's Traditional Dishes,I've looked through and tried a few recipes which I found perhaps basic but very traditional. With my attention on Hong Kong and Szechwan styles I thought the 'recipes would be spicier'. Authentic is most important though; I can easily adjust heat range after trying these dishes. Very promising material. Thanks for sharing!
3,Good leftovers!,"This is a nice collection of demos & left off tracks from one of the bands that should've been a household name in the 80s rock scene. While I'm a fan of their first 2 releases, and not so much their third effort, this cd shows you pieces of each phase of their career. Quality is remarkably good on most of the tracks. Only two songs really sound like demos. The rest must have been produced by a pro, mixed down, and just missed the cut for the album.Stand-outs for me include the more rockin' songs (Break It Down, Don't blow Your Chances, Hot Women, Knock Em Dead, Nightmare), but ""Keep On Believing"" should have made it's way onto an album too.The mellower, synth driven songs don't do anything for me, but I know the record company was behind the push for that stuff.Wish these guys would've gotten the chance they deserved to shine. What could've been...At least we have this gem, and Pettology to remember how great they were."
1,Nothing more then a cash-in release...,"This LP was clearly rushed out to do nothing but make money. Half the ""album"" is more like a collection of announcers calling plays for the team over the years, which is a complete waste of time and NOTHING but filler, and it goes from bad to worse, collecting VERY miscellaneous tracks from all over the place.....This is some serious ..., I'm sorry to say. Even if you were to get this for free, it still would hardly be worth it...Avoid this as much as possible. It's nothing but a cash-in attempt on the Lakers recent success."
5,Da Bomb!,"Man, this album was tighter than lovejoys locks. It was of da hook. I mean Kobe and Shaq had there little thing goin on and my man Guy Pope he was buzzin Trust me dawl if you don't by this album you should get your head checked cos it's above da rim-to the max .HEAR ME NOW!"
2,Major disappointment,"This DVD consists of the PBS doc on the Gipsy Kings, Tierra Gitana, and a live concert at the Greek Theatre in 1990. The former is probably worth the price, even though much of the video appears to have come from PAL format tapes that were not terribly well converted. The story's the thing here, and the fascinating history and the vintage video from the Reyes' early lives and travels with their famous father is very interesting.The concert doesn't live up to expectations. The video is of very low quality--some shots have blown-out highlights--and the audio sounds as though it was rerecorded in the men's room at Howard Johnson's.For me to dis any Gipsy King's offering is about as likely as sunshine in Oregon in January. If you are willing to pay the price to see the PBS doc, you won't be disappointed, but if you're also in it for the concert experience, I'd give this a pass."
3,Don't really understand the purpose?,I would much rather use my hands and finger. I really don't understand the purpose. I tried it but my fingers do a much better job at applying my foundation!!!
3,Super soft but pink dye bleeds a lot.,"The Beauty Blender is super soft, and that's my favorite thing about it. That's also really the only difference between it and another blending sponge. You get the same results. It's great for the eye area because it applies makeup so gently. I don't know whether its worth the price though yet.I washed it a few times now and each time the dye has bled. Not liking that.The first time, the dye bled a lot. Now the sponge is a lighter pink color.Im also starting to feel like it takes less time to just use my hand/fingers for foundation application then using this. Eiether way you get nice results."
2,Not so much...,"I have to say that I had high hopes for this product, the reviews were good, and the shape made sense -- add to that the cleanser, and I was excited to receive it.Unfortunately, the sponge does not do the job well, nor is it firm enough. Regarding cleaning it, the enclosed pads don't do the job as well as water and some soap if neeed. Needless to say, I'm disappointed -- this is not the ""better mouse-trap"" I hoped for.I say skip this product as is, and let's hope they improve it, and not just be a girly-girl pink gimmick. The packaging is darn cute though <g>.just my .02 for free"
5,BEAUTY BLENDER ROCKS!,"I have been wearing liquid foundation for twenty years. I have tried every newfangled way of applying it: from expensive foundation brushes, all types of sponges and of course, my fingers. I always go back to application by finger. Seems the easiest and most effective way. Then I saw Beauty Blender in a YouTube video. It intrigued me. I watched a few You tube tutorials, and decoded I should buy one. At twenty bucks for one sponge, it is pricey, but I went for it, but keeping my expectation level down. I've tried too many gimmicks... but this is no gimmick. It REALLY WORKS! It transforms your foundation to an airbrushed look. So easy to apply (just make sure sponge is damp). And you end up using less foundation.Hands down, one of my best beauty purchases EVER!Suggest you go on YouTube and and view some BeautyBlender tutorials. It will help you perfect the application."
4,Great product,"I've seen so much about the beauty blender. I finally brought myself to spend $19 on 2 sponges, which I thought was too much. I do like them, foundation looks flawless and gives great coverage. Does not leave streaks like with a foundation brush. I have been using the beauty blender ever since."
4,"Like it, don't love it","It is a nice little shape and puts on foundation very nicely. I just feel it's a little over priced; only lasted about a month and a half before it sort of shredded, and I don't like that you have to buy a special cleaner for it. I didn't buy the cleaner, but cleaned it with gentle soap and water. When cleaning it, a bunch of the pink dye would come out, making me skeptical about rubbing that damp sponge all over my face or my clients faces. I most likely will not purchase this sponge again, I do like sponges, but this one just didnt perform any better than much cheaper sponges."
5,Love this sponge!,This sponge is amazing and does what it says - I have been using brushes & drugstore sponges for several years. Will never go back to either of them. :)
5,AMAZING,"This product lives up to all the hype surrounding it. I know it seems crazy that a small pink sponge can really be this amazing. I researched the BeautyBlender for weeks before finally making the purchase...curiosity got the best of me! I don't regret buying it at all. It works wonders for applying foundation and it really does give a flawless finish and application, perfect for blending, applying concealers and even blush. This product is highly recommended. I know it appears very pricey for a small egg-shaped sponge, but it's really worth it. It is so versatile and, if properly taken care of, the sponge can last months!"
5,best foundation applicator,Been using this for more than 1 year already and it is the best applicator for foundation! Makes it look natural and evenly distributed.
2,Didn't Do Much,Don't waste your money on this! It is a weird shape and doesn't get clean completely. the pointy end is useless.
3,Over priced,"I give it three star because it's really being over priced, you can get a way better brush at this price. Yes, it's a nice sponge, it works like miracle, but it doesn't worth it. If you watch Youtube and do a little bit research on prive labeling you will know what I'm talking about."
4,Fun and easy,"These are fun and easy to clean. They blend makeup well, but I still need a brush for some areas."
5,"Wow, love it!","I've always used my fingers or brushes to blend but I decided to try this sponge. It's awesome! I couldn't believe what a huge difference it made, both in ease of blending and how much better my makeup looked! It may seem a little expensive at first but trust me, it's well worth it. It's easy to use, just dampen it slightly and use it to stipple on whatever product you like, or to blend. Awesome!"
5,Love these makeup sponges!,"I heard about these on a YouTube video. I love the way these apply my foundation, the little amount of foundation I put on. Also it helps blend my concealer, makes my makeup look totally finished. You can use dry, but best if they are wet, the makeup will absorb better.If you apply liquid foundation, you have to try these! You won't be sorry!!!"
3,It's okay,I thought this product would help me have the illusion of having no foundation on. It didn't do much for me. I don't use this product to put foundation on anymore. I just use it to 'matte' my foundation if I do use it at all. I have embarrassing problem skin so I have to use foundation everyday to cover it. Maybe I just need to keep trying it. I rather use my foundation brushes.
4,A MUST HAVE!!!,"This thing is one of those...WOW , this really does work. I didn't give it 5 stars because when I washed, it ran pink dye under the water. Not a huge deal but I kinda wonder if any of that pigment is getting on my face? However, I love the fact that you can get heavy coverage by using it dry and light coverage when you wet it. The Beautyblender should be in every woman's makeup bag."
3,nothing special.,"I would say this product is really just nothing special. I couldn't tell a difference between using those disposable ones you can buy in a big bag. I have used this about 5 or so times and I am already seeing small holes and tears in it. I would have thought it should last a lot longer than just a few uses. So overall I would say, don't waste your money on this."
1,Disappointed,"I had high hopes based on reviews (on this site and other sites), but there is nothing special about these. I wanted something to help ensure smooth application of make-up, but the Beauty Blender did nothing much different than any other discount store sponge. It was more awkward to work with, too."
2,Really unimpressed,"These are really nothing special. They don't seem to improve the appearance of my foundation at all, and the pointed end is useless. I am disappointed. They are also extremely difficult to clean."
4,Not Sure What The Big Deal Is?,"Ok..it holds together nicely while you dab on your foundation...but really I don't see what the big deal is about this sponge. My skin looked absolutely the same as when I used a cheapy sponge from the drugstore. This will last a lot longer however as it doesn't fall to bits when you apply your makeup. I do not like the way all the pink dye starts coming out of the sponge when you wash it...yukko! Will I keep using it though? Sure...it's a nice makeup tool but if you are expecting it to make your skin look flawless...I think you will be disappointed. I say if you have the extra money and you like to play around with different beauty tools, go for it!"
1,Poor Quality,"When I use this sponge to apply foundation, tiny hot pink specks remain on my face from the sponge. I'm back to the drawing board, trying to find a sponge that will replace a brand I've been using for years that is no longer available."
4,All honesty,"I still ended up using more foundation than I would using the blender than when I use my foundation brush, and that's with using a primer as well. I did like the way it blended, almost flawless but if you naturally have a good hand at applying makeup then I suppose you could achieve that with any tool. The blender also does soak up way less product than your average makeup sponge does, but it's still a sponge and it still soaks up. I guess I was just expecting a miracle of sorts since most magazines and celeb makeup artists swear by it but there's still improvements to be made. Overall, I think it's a bit over priced for what it's worth. I'll continue to use the one I have until it inusable anymore but I don't think I'll be rushing to purchase another one anytime soon. I'll start looking for a good quality foundation brush for now."
2,Not for me,I've only used it a few times but wasn't impressed - especially for the cost. I got better results by just using a primer before makeup without applying with sponge. This seemed to make the makeup look thick on me and made pores look huge even with primer first. I personally wouldn't recommend it.~Melissa
5,Great!,"My makeup priorities: decent quality, not too expensive, and fast (I have 2 small children). These sponges are easy to use and leave my face looking even but dewy. I use them with Revlon Colorstay foundation, nothing fancy, and it looks much better than when I apply using just my fingers-- better finish and much longer-lasting. The only problem is that the bulbous, bright pink sponge is terribly cute to a 3-year-old's eyes...good thing I bought the 2-pack."
5,Excelent make up!,"Hello, this is Rogelio, and i just want to say that this is an AWESOME make up, OH! MY! GOSH!"
1,Not what I expected,"The photo showed 2 sponges and I was so happy I thought I got a good deal. Who knew, when I opened the package, I only saw 1 sponge and I was extremely disappointed. I'm sure its good, everyone says it is, but I am disappointed to be paying so much for only 1 sponge."
3,beautyblender,this product is ok. works ok but already peeling away. not sure i would buy again. concept is good.
2,Take My Advice and Pass...,"I read about this in a magazine where the reviewer raved and raved. I figured, why not and ordered it even tho it was pricey. It's cute, you bet, but just try cleaning it after the first use. What do you mean it won't come clean?? Try soap?? Still nothing?? You can still see and feel the make up ??So, now I have this cute, used to be pink, thingy on my counter. Can't get it clean no matter how I try. My advice would be to stick to your old foam wedges that can be cleaned."
2,sponge- tiny weeny,i was disappointed....i thought it was larger than it was and then i saw the exact same thing for $5 in TJ Max!
5,Can't live without them!,"I have tried everything to apply foundation. I love Beauty Blenders but they are expensive so I tried other options. I got an expensive professional brush, and even the Sephora sponge but I ended up returning everything. There is nothing like the Beauty Blender. I wet it before applying my foundation so I doesn't go on as thick. There are no brush marks or blotchy spots because it covers so much area at once. I don't think I will ever go back to another application method. No matter how much they charge for the Beauty Blender i will continue to buy it!"
3,I could never really get them clean,"Unfortunately, I didn't like these. The Beautyblenders applied my foundation well, but no better than the disposable round sponges I usually get. My main problem with the Beautyblenders was that I never really could get them clean (and they quickly became stained with foundation, which adds to the impression that they're not getting clean). And I'd go to use them the next morning and they'd still be a little damp - I worried bacteria was in them. Since I'm prone to acne and I have to be careful what comes into contact with my face, I've gone back to using disposable sponges. Also, I didn't care for whatever pink dye they used in these... it bled out of the Beautyblender every time I washed it."
4,Ripped but still works,"It's a sponge so naturally its going to rip after repeated use. I think it ripped fairly quickly though even though I moisten it prior to use. The price has increased since it's popularity has soared, way too pricey now. Okay product if you want to even and smooth out your makeup, 3 1/2 stars for me."
4,"Nice, quality sponge, no miracles of course","I like the fact that you dampen the sponge before using it to apply liquid foundation, because that helps with the smooth application results. This sponge is made of good quality sponge material that I dont anticipate cracking or breaking apart like cheaper sponges tend to. It doesn't work miracles, of course, but I am pleased with the sponge and it works a bit better than my fingers (which work better than any previous sponge). Read the directions for use and care."
2,Not worth it.,"Way too expensive for a piece of foam. I tried using this for a few weeks, and gave up, going back to using my fingers or brushes. The sponge gets stained easily, and doesnt really blend as well as it is portrayed to. Does not live up to the hype!"
5,Product of the year!,Can't imagine life without beauty blender! This product makes me feel like a million bucks every time!! Thanks! I definitely recommend this.
3,It's okay,"I bought into the hype but, I don't like how you have to clean it...kind of gross. If you think about how much bacteria stays in a kitchen sponge...eew...I couldn't get over how it couldn't be cleaned enough...the makeup went on flawlessly but, a nice brush can do the same and it is easier to clean."
2,Love it at first,Not sure if I was sold a fake version of this but I have had it for about 3 weeks and it has completely fallen apart. Not sure why but it is coming apart in pieces.
5,I love it,"It's amazing ! I saw that the make up artists were using this and saying how great is this so I order it. OMG ,I love it ,it is amazing how it make your foundation so smooth and natural looking. I love it love it love it..."
2,not my best purchase,"I purchased this item over the summer because of hearing good reviews on you tube, delivery was prompt but the product didn't really make much of a difference to me. I have used wedges, brushes and sponges in the past and the beauty blender doesn't apply foundation better than any other sponge or brush i've used. I do not have alot of scars/blemishes on my face but i love using full coverage foundation to hide those scars that i do have and i've found that my revelon concealer brush or a round brush applies foundation most wonderfully, the look is natural and never cakey. After purchasing and using this item it just went into the basket i store my other sponges in - i gave this item a two because delivery was good and it's my favorite color - pink! I would recommend if you're looking to buy a good sponge but in my opinion it's not the best one out there"
3,Good sponge but....,"I have been a make up artist for 20+ years and this is one of the better sponges that I've used because of the shape. However, I do not feel it is anywhere near worth what they are charging for it - downright ridiculous in my book. I will try the Monster bundle next time - much better value and I am guessing on-par quality."
5,love it,works well with blending makeup. Its cool how it doubles in size when wet. I love it sooooo much that am ordering more.
5,Great,"I love this product. Can see a huge difference when applying my make up. I loved them so much I bought some for my daughter, who also loves them."
4,Beauty Blender Pretty Good,Provides an even coverage of makeup. I definitely use less make up. The only problem I have is the sponge does not come completely clean and my sponge has already torn on the rounded ended after having for only 2 weeks. But the cleaner that is made for cleaning the sponge is excellent. I was cleaning all my makeup brushes with baby shampoo and could not get the white ones back to there original white color. However the cleaner does the job and my brushes look brand new...the cleaner is excellent!!!
4,Beautyblender!,The beautyblender works as the name says! It's great at blending makeups and can be used with every single one that I have. This really saves me from keeping a soo many sponges when I travel or in my toilet. The shape is amazing for applying makeup although it did take me a little bit of time to get used to.It is a bit pricey but you can use this for ages! Would definitely recommend it!

4,Great Book!,"I have read all three of Mr. Rusnells books. I think they really make you think about the coincidences in your own life. Many times I have thought about things that happened to me and wondered, how could that be? Why did this happen at this particular time in my life? I thought Mr. Rushnell's book help put these life events in perspective I can't think of a better name then God Winks too!"
5,I wish I could give it 10 stars!,"This book was Heaven-sent to me, it was a real Godwink! Never had another book filled me up with so much hope, it makes me believe in real love again."
5,When God Winks on Love is Great!,I thought this book was very intersting! The book was very easy to read and very informative. I related to the book in many ways. I agree with what squire says about love and relationships. I learned alot of what he says about godwinks and love. It was very much like the first book which made it easy to understand.
2,Better off reading The Bible for advice,"To make a choice on the person you live the rest of your life with based on sheer coincidence would be foolish indeed. God certainly orchestrates things, but He wouldn't give us an entire bible full of wisdom to teach us about Himself if we didn't need it.Most relationships in the bible did NOT happen on coincidence, most relationships back then were arranged.And not only that, Satan is real and knows how to bring about seeming coincidences in our lives...most certainly he is a great deceiver and if we don't have God's truth hidden in our hearts we can fall for the wrong coincidences!I suggest reading The Meaning of Marriage by Tim Keller if you want some good guidelines on what even is God's purpose for marriage. Get a good vision for what marriage should be and you will be able to make a wise choice on who to marry beyond relying on a series of whimsical circumstances."
2,"Mediocre, Derivative, Best Watched When Drunk","An army team of six soldiers and a sort of government agent are sent to a forgotten abandoned island in the Pacific once used as an internment camp for Japanese Americans. It turns out however that a UFO forty/fifty years ago had crashed there and the surviving aliens dissected by the government. One of these aliens escaped and went on a rampage (presumably angry that its mate had still been alive when cut into little pieces). Our sad sacks find this alien alive and well and still angry after all these years. Derivative of the Alien movies - down to the encasing of human victims in some sort of coccoon. If you're really bored and slightly drunk, you might like this stuff. Maybe. I watched it on cable and liked it, but then I was pretty high. Was this a comedy?"
4,gibberish 6,"Not a bad movie, but one with some redeeming qualities, like action.They also develop some of the charachters pretty well. All in all, not exellent, but not a total piece of crap"
2,Keep going...,"Except for one scene where this nice looking girl gets caught in a giant sticky web (nice bondage undertones ;) The movie is a flop, good for a rental if there is nothing else on, and if you have freinds over, to goof on."
3,Its not kitchen aid but does an ok job,Daily usage starts to show ear and tear very fast but it still does a fine job. Not for the culinary expert in the kitchen but for people who visit the kitchen one in a while it works great
5,"Great product, better price.","Got this as a great deal at $39 + free shipping. The lids fit fantastic. Steamer is decent size, small for some things, but perfect for most uses. Pans are overall very good, clean well, and the nostick is wonderful. The silicone grips of the everyday pan coule be larger, but that is a small problem. Pan edges can be sharp on the pans though, and I did cut myself taking them out of the box. Once you get used to the pans, they are wonderful. I find them in use every day. The price was a fantastic deal and since I paid considerably more for my last nonstick pan (just one pan) than this whole set, if I end up throwing them out after a couple of years, I have more than gotten my money's worth."
2,Not a real bargain,"The price for this item was 69.99 and I returned it. There are a lot of pans, but the quality of the material (thickness of the Aluminum) is very poor. I can buy just as nice a set at Ollie's Bargain Outlet for about the same price. I thought I was getting a real bargain at $70 because the set supposedly retailed for ""$400"". What a joke. It's only worth about $70 t0 $90. I you pay more than $70 to $90, you've been ripped off.The set has a lot of feature (lots of nice glass lids, riveted handles, etc...) but don't be deceived. This is NOT a high quality set. This is a starter set for a young family that needs a lot of cookware. The material is just too thin to heat evenly. Also, it will warp and then not lay flat on my flat ceramic cooktop. If you have a gas cookstove, this might be OK for you, but believe me, a set this thin WILL NOT hold up well on a ceramic top. Also, the box said it was good in the oven to only 350 degrees. That's less than I thought from the ad on Amazon."
3,"I love this toy, baby does not","I love this toy! It feels nice and is aesthetically pleasing. However my baby has never liked this toy. I tried it at 3 months, at 6 months, 1 year and despite my enthusiastic introductions and encouragements he has NEVER had any interest. Bummer."
3,Quality toy but my son doesn't like it,"I was really anxious to purchase this toy since it had so many good reviews. It looks really appealing, very colorful and basic but fun. However my son has had it for 2 months and has shown minimal interest in it. He'll hold it for a max of 10 seconds before either throwing it or just dropping it to grab something else, even from the first time he saw it. I purchased it mainly for teething purposes and thought it would also be a good rattle that wouldn't drive me crazy with a loud jingle. I think this might work well as a teether for babies who prefer a hard surface to chew on. I will say that it is very well-made, a smooth, nicely finished wood with natural-looking but bright paint. This toy would last through multiple children."
1,"Very disapointed, defective product.","This item comes defective. The red piece detaches from the white piece. Upon first rinse, the green piece also detaches from the white piece. You can still see the glue marks on both ends of the white piece. Very disappointed at this HABA teether! I didn't even get a chance to offer it to my 7 months old."
4,Nice toy,"I was very excited to buy this toy for my teething 8-month-old daughter as opposed to a plastic teether. But she doesn't seem to be as excited about it as I was. She doesn't really try to teethe on it very much. She basically picks it up and shakes it around, then throws it. I do very much like the quality of this toy - it seems like it will last for years and years. I will definitely buy Haba toys again for her."
1,Paint comes off!,"I bought this thinking it's an alternative to plastic, what with all the high quality assurances. A few weeks after my baby started gnawing the toy, I found that some of the paint has disappeared. And my baby doesn't even have any teeth! This is very worrying. Parents beware!"
5,Wonderful toy,"My baby girl ""played"" with this toy today for the first time while I was bathing her. She HATES pacifiers, bottles, or any plastic thing in her mouth. I wanted to introduce wood slowly so that once she starts teething, she can chew on something. She loved it. She held it with her tiny fingers, and I helped her chew on it. Slightly big to chew on for this age, but still wonderful. Very safe and durable toy."
4,Great for small babies but watch out for toddlers...,"I purchased this for my 3 month old son and it is great for him, although he's too young to use it for teething he loves the sound the loose rings make while I shake it and he is fascinated by the colors. We'll play with this for at least 30 minutes. The problem is my 3 year old thought she'd use it for teething and with one bite dented in the wood significantly (I got it away from her before she could splinter the wood). There is also a possibility of the baby pinching his fingers in it as the colored wood parts do pull apart and I can't help but wonder just how strong the string holding them together is. The colored pieces of wood are movable and can be twisted into shapes which really interests my son- this does pose a bigger problem of being pinched but so far it hasn't been a problem yet.While is is beautiful and clearly a much better option than plastic it's not the perfect teether in my opinion."
5,Great infant toy,This was the first toy my son started to play with. It's lightweight for a wooden toy and very durable. Overall another awesome toy from Haba!
5,Good Grasp Toy/Teether,My daughter loves to hold and chew it (which is great instead of her chewing plastic rings). It's also a good rattle.
3,My baby simply didn't like it,"Yes, my baby didn't like it, he prefers more Sassy Talk & Fold Phone and Sophie the teether. I was really anxious to purchase this Kringelring toy, It looks really nice and light, very colorful , a little thick. However my son has had it for 5 months and has shown no interest at all. He will hold it for a few seconds before throwing it away. But to say the truth it is very well-made, colorful, and nicely finished wood with natural material."
5,Love it!,"I love the quality of this toy. The colors are so bright and eye catching. My baby boy starting playing with this when he was about 5 months old, he really likes it a lot. That being said he likes his other 3$ rattle just as much, but I like this one a lot better."
3,Well made! but too thick as a teether,"I bought this thinking it would be great for our 4 month old to bang around and chew on since she is teething early. She definitely likes it as a rattle (tons of fun when you slip it on her wrist). But as a teether its a little too thick. Very durable, colorful toy that will last forever...just serving a different purpose than what i originally intended."
4,Fun rattle,"This is a beautiful toy. I don't have to worry about the paints used and I love that it isn't plastic. The white part is inflexible while the colored section is. The rattle sound is gentle and my four-month-old daughter likes to swing the toy back and forth. Plus it has a great name! :) However, I was hoping it would be a good chew toy and it hasn't been. It's a good size for grabbing but a little big (diameter of ring and diameter of the wood) to stick in her mouth comfortably. It's a five-star rattle and a three-star teether."
5,Simple but a great alternative to the plastic options,"This is one of my favorite toys that we had for our two children as babies. The wooden material has a nice, pleasing finish, is easy to grip, features bright colors, and makes a satisfying (if subdued) wooden rattle sound when shaken. I would buy this again!"
5,awesome my 2 month old loves this,my 2 month old son loves this its the first toy he grasped and he just loves it he was smiling and giggling and putting in his mouth the colors are very rich and its very durable and light weight he loves thesounds the rings make when you shake it
2,Good value for a collection - but nothing breathtaking,"I have never got particularly excited about Marsalis. I prefer the more restricted issues of his brother on sax. If you are looking for an introduction into Marsalis's work, this is a good value ""greatest hits"", played live. However, as someone with an extensive collection I rarely come back to this one. Rated as a box set, it sits well below My Jarret (Blue Note) or any of the Miles Davis Boxes, in particular my beloved ""plugged nickel"". Very average and at times hard going."
5,A Ticket To Jazz Heaven,"After I had listened to this 8 hour set the first time I was sad; sad because I couldn't play the set again since it was 2 in the morning and I had to get some sleep! Wynton's incredible mastery of almost every style of jazz is incredible. On Cherokee, he blows an absolutely amazing solo that I believe rivals the great Clifford Brown. The two tenor saxes of the septet create some very interesting contemporary motifs on The Egyptian Blues andMarsalis is also able to show his soulful and sweet playing in both takes of the ballad Stardust. These and many more profound tracks make this box set impeccable. (and its such a value as well!!)"
5,"A Very Good ""Bill Whithers"" CD","If you are a Bill Whithers fan then this is a must have CD for your collection. The CD contains all of his best hits. You are reminded of Bill Whithers from his ""Hey Days""!!"
2,Not Good. They almost Suck.,"These headphones crank up the bass really high and drown the treble.Beware of these if you have a big head: the cords connecting to each earphonewill bind tightly around your neck at the place where they converge,causing discomfort or minor strangulation."
2,Headphones don't fit properly; broke in 3 months,"Beware with these headphones unless you have a fairly small head. I am a normal-sized male and these headphones never properly closed over my ears. From the pulling down on the headphones, the hinge connecting the right and left sides gave out after a few months. Other than the poor build quality, the sound was about what you would expect for the price ... not bad but not great, either. The noise reduction adds a white noise to the output, but I never tried using it in crowded or noisy areas."
2,Digressive is right,"The cover of the book calls it wildly digressive. Too true! I want to read this book but I find myself becoming infuriated with the writing style. In addition, there are four people who ""speak"" in the novel. But they all sound alike. They are incapable of saying anything without going off into multitudes of tangents full of literary illusions. This takes more patience than I have."
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"I HAVE JUST ORDERED A FEW GREEN DAY DVDS AND HAVE JUST WATCHED THE DVD COMBO FROM SWEET CHILDREN TO AMERICAN IDIOTS AND THIS ONE GREEN DAY MUSIC IN REVIEW THE ARE THEY SAME DVD DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I HAVE ALSO JUST BEGUN WATCHING GREEN DAY ROCK CASE STUDIES, SAME PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT GREEN DAY NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHERS."
1,KINGDOM HEARTS NECKLACE,RECIEVED IN TIMELY MANNER UNFORTUNATELY THE BALE ON THE PENDANT WAS CRACKED & BROKE IN HALF BY THE 5TH DAY OF WEARING IT.
2,A 'do-fer'.,"This featherboard will do in a pinch, but the slots are long and weak, and tend to bow out, particularly the angled slot. I did not have the positioning problems that other reviewers mention, but I am afraid that, if I tighten the knob too much it will open up the slot and slide right in. Suggest looking for a different product."
1,Not a fan,"This stuff does not work at all, I really wanted it to, as the risk of all other brands are very concerning. i am very disappointed that after a couple of hours it smelled as if I forgot my deodorant!"
4,Soul Girls With Some Great Advice,"This CD is a personal favorite of mine. The well written insert adds to the experience. Who knew that so many of these infamous songs were written by men?This is a great album for all women, but especially single women who are looking to be reminded that low down men are just not worth it. The sassy tunes are very catchy.Songs like ""Wedlock Is a Padlock"" and ""The Day I Found Myself"" are reminders that although a man can compliment a woman...the wrong one can cause a lot more pain than good."
3,Ok but not the best,I liked the color but the ear buds keep falling out during my exercise so i have to get some better ones
1,Still don't have my order.,"I never received my order. If I get my order, I'll replace this with a decent review. I had planned on using my tippet for a fishing trip, but that trip has come and gone and still no tippet.VERY DISAPPOINTED."
1,sentimental,"I agree with the ""never"" reviewer, unless you are a personal friend of hers, there is nothing to recommend here, no talent, no insight, no sense of the language, no deep probes, -- in short, mere vanity exercises."
5,Cliff Notes on Pollack is a good introduction,"The author gives us the fundamentals on Pollock, the man, the painter, the influences, the critics, contemporary painters, plus Pollock's wife Lee Krasner and other supporters. I enjoyed it quite a bit."
3,"Interesting, but unfortunately, annoying","Um...Like...underline...superficial...as if! This book is cute but it's so simple and silly, it made me feel like I was hearing the story of a great and influential artist, being told by a pretentious poser. The points it covers really are interesting and important but I think this book is a bit annoying."
4,Lots of politics,"I really enjoyed reading about the history of Hungary as a person of Hungarian heritage. However, the author goes on and on and on in too much detail about the parlimentary proceedings. I did read with interest about the various regions and the conflicts and of the ethnic differences. The love interests in the book, as a female, kept my interest. I bought all three books in the series and hope I will enjoy the others as much as this one."
5,One of the best cookbooks!,"This is by far the best and most useful cookbook in my collection. Sara Finkel's recipes are true and exact and if followed correctly come out great. The recipes are from scratch and even though there are no pictures, every recipee I've made from this book has come out delicious. I've given this book to others as gifts and even had to purchase an additional copy for Passover, since my regular one was so used up.Highly reccommended for the novice as well as the expert."
1,bad,"It cannot work. I donot know why. You gave me replacement item. But neither of them can work. So I returned them two weeks ago. However, I received a letter from yours indicated that you have not received them and would charge me for two watches' cost. I would say I really disappointed with this item for it made me too much trouble."
3,Juli Reding is the only reason to see this film,The story of an investigator and his fiance going to an exotic locale is trite. The sight of cantilevered pin-up Juli Reding in a bathing suit and an angorra sweater is worth five stars although her acting is poor.
1,Great price; Too bad no Apple support,"It's a shame. This is one of the best written dramas of all time. And Amazon's price for SD streaming and downloads is very good. BUT, in our household, we manage our video collection and viewing using a 27"" iMac and two 2nd gen Apple TVs. Everything works flawlessly and wireless where needed. iTunes makes organization dead simple and the whole system always works flawlessly. Unfortunately, Amazon has decided not to produce Mac software to allow downloading to Macs for use in iTunes. (And I bet if they do ever create Mac software, it will require using a specific and poorly designed Amazon app to organize and stream directly from a Mac to an attached HDTV - no standards-compliant, iTunes compatible file formats.) Content providers and retailers need to learn that their place is to PROVIDE content, not control where and how we watch it."
1,$2 per episode is TOO MUCH for a TV series,"I don't know how Amazon arrives at the pricing for old TV series. We also wanted to watch some old x-files. That was $1 per episode. Just joined Amazon to see if they were an alternative to Netflix. At least not as far as streaming old TV shows. Will now check Hulu - altho you have to pay them a monthly $8 fee, so that might not work.I can, possibly, see a nominal charge. Maybe $5 for a season's series. Not $1 or $2 per episode. At $2, you could probably by the whole season for less than that and own DVDs."
2,That boat left and I wasn't on it...,"...despite being fairly liberal in my politics, I just don't get this show...it is TOO sappy, too PC, too, I guess, self-righteous and smug...it, to me, features all the over-the-top cliches about liberals that the Neocons trade in...that can't be a good thing, can it?"
3,I use to love this show,"I use to love this show It was fresh, charming, politically less nuetral then it became, then it made a mistake. I'm not sure when it happened, but when Al Gore gave Martin Sheen what looked like a script I began to feel they were taking themselves a little to seriously. It's a freakin TV show folks! It's not the real west wing. That's were they lost me. When the actor Martin Sheen was yelling at God during his secratary funeral service I thought doesn't this show know it's only TV. It would have remain a great show if it had remembered what it really was."
5,Best Drama Series,"I cannot wait until ""The West Wing"" comes out on DVD here in the US. The wait is almost over!! It will be very nice to be able to sit down and watch the most entertaining and incredibly well-written series on TV on DVD instead of a tape."
3,The show is good... the DVDs are not,"These DVDs were the worst quality I've seen yet. I am an avid watcher of the show and highly anticipated the release of it to DVD, but the set was scratched excessively and some disks were mislabeled. I thought it might have simply been a bad copy, but after talking with several others I found that this was common with a large number of the First Season DVDs. I only hope they find a better company to make the Second Season set."
4,Fraud unlimited,It's good to see how a Democratic White House works. They are knuckleheads. Maybe in another four years we can bring sanity to DC
4,"Don't wait for a Widescreen version, there isn't one.","I abhor the practice of releasing fullscreen versions of widescreen original releases more than most, but I must challenge a previous reviewer's ire. After some research I've confirmed that the first season of ""The West Wing"" was shot in 1.33:1 (full screen) aspect ratio and later seasons are in 1.78:1 (widescreen).A 1.78:1 widescreen verison would need to be cropped from the original 1.33:1 full screen version and would lose part of the original image, something that viewers with multiple display formats offered by plasma screens can do already. I recommend being happy with what we have - a faithful copy of the original program.The West Wing is quite simply the best television that I have seen in a several decade of viewing across two continents. You could rent it, or borrow it from a friend, but you'll end up needing to order it anyway!"
5,Excellent Television,"This is what television stations get when people who know what they are doing, really try to write, act, and make a superior show to put on t.v."
5,"The BEST show on TV, hands down!","The West Wing is one of the only shows worth watching on TV these days. Unfortunately, our citizens have become politically apathetic, and seem to be criminally ignorant of how our country's government works. And, while possibly not a 100% accurate, The West Wing is about as close as you are going to get to a real look at the goings-on inside Washington and, more importantly, inside the White House. What is unique about this show, is that, although it takes place (mostly) inside The White House, it does NOT focus on the President. Instead, it goes beyond any other attempt at political fiction, and focuses on the actions of the hard-working, and under-appreciated staffers that support the President and carry out his orders. This show has everything... romance, political drama, suspense, humor, fast paced dialog, and most importantly, deep, intelligent, and easy-to-like characters. Buy this for your collection and be sure to watch the hit on NBC!"
1,Sick of Disk Problems Here,"I don't understand why you keep selling these sets when people complain about big problems with the disks and packaging. You just lower the price on junk instead of replacing it with a quality product. It is as if you hope no one will check out their disks in 30 days and not be able to send them back. When you have a considerable number faulty disks, it it time to create better contracts with your providers/producers so they eat any faulty and returned disks. I went through the same thing last year when someone bought be the piece of junk pink Sex and the City set and then had problems and found everyone had problems. Yet you just kept selling it! Stop selling junk. A DVD you can not watch is not worth half price! People want good, quality DVDs to watch one of the highest quality dramas ever on TV. Shame on you Amazon."
5,I love the West Wing,"From the first time I watched this program I loved it. I was angry when it was cancelled because the writing was incredible, the characters and storylines were the best I had ever seen and I waited impatiently each week for what came next. I haven't enjoyed any program as much until I started watching NCIS."
4,duplicate DVD,"The set I received has two disks #2. I would have liked to have had disk #1. Kept me from ordering the following seasons. (The set I ordered was ""West Wing"" first season."
5,The West Wing the first Season,"I just finished watching the first season of the West Wing. I have to say it is excellent!!! I did not watch this on TV when it originally aired, but I get to catch up with it on DVD. I can't wait to watch season two. I beleive this to be one of the most intelligently written and acted television shows. Im a huge Sopranos fan and I think it rivals even that. The dialogue is brisk and you do have to listen carefully to what they are saying, but, thats a benefit of owning it on DVD, you can reverse it and listen again. I think the cast, beginning with Martin Sheen and John Spencer are at the top of their game. This was a show that once I watched an episode I wanted more. The awards this show won for it's first season were definitely earned."
2,first disc skips,"I love the show, for its intelligence and wit, but as far as this amazon purchase goes, I'm not all that satisfied. I'll keep them b/c the rest work, but the first disk has a scratch that makes it skip. I'm disappointed."
5,The Best Series I've Seen in Years,"This review refers to the Region 2 (PAL) versions of the DVD. The UK market gets a headstart in seeing the release of Season 1 of The West Wing in 2 DVD box sets (Set 1-Episodes 1-11 & Set 2-Episodes 12-22). The show itself is fast paced and brimming with intelligent dialogue. Once you put it in your DVD player, you wouldn't want to stop until you get to the end of it. Special features for Set 1 include TV spot & short interviews with major cast members and Aaron Sorkin, the creator of the show & DVD-ROM enhanced features. Set 2 extras include several TV spots and 'Making of' featurette for all TWW fans & DVD-ROM features. Extremely satisfying TV viewing. Can't wait for the new seasons to come out on DVD."
5,The West Wing,What an interesting show! So glad that I can see it on my Kendal Fire without the commercials. I am always sorry which each episode is over...
5,One of the best episodes in the best series ever,"If only more people in the real world could live up to the idolized versions of Aaron Sorkin's world, maybe, just maybe, politics wouldn't be such a dirty word or filthy business. The portrayal of an true outsider to the political scene being willing to listen to reason, change his mind (and his vote) based on logic and reason, instead of clinging blindly to party loyalty and politics, is a wonderful dream worth watching."
4,"Thrilled to see it on Amazon, Love this show, but.....","Great show, love that it is on Amazon, cant stand the little bits with unfinished sentences, 'how is that thing? The thing? Yea, the thing with the...', uhg! Josh: 'Donnaaaaaaa', uhg! Otherwise, great show."
3,Great show - but where's the French soundtrack?,"Over seven million potential North American viewers of this show live in the French-speaking province of Quebec. The French version aired on the CBC, so it already does exist - and it is available on DVD in Europe, albeit on Region 2 DVD's. Would it have been too much trouble to include that on this DVD set?"
3,"Ok, I wasn't Enthralled.","There are many good things about this series, the actors are good, setting, etc. but it lacked characters I really, really cared about and stories which motivated me to watch the next episode. I limped through the DVDs and barely got through them. Maybe the show gets better, maybe I missed something, but I just wasn't drawn into the show."
3,"Decent entertainment, hard left slant on everything","There are definitely worse ways to spend 45 minutes watching tv & strictly as entertainment, I have to say that it succeeds [...]. My biggest criticism is that, just like every tv show of the last 20 years set in DC, the POTUS is a bleeding heart liberal and everyone to the right of Stalin is portrayed as evil incarnate. Just about every episode has some preachy message, delivered in a way that's about as subtle as a mugging. Guns bad, gun control good. Religion bad, 'pro-choice' good. Drilling for oil bad, tax money for public art good. And on and on and on...."
2,Disappointed with quality of used DVD set purchase.,"I purchased a used set and have been very disappointed. Of the four discs to the set, two could not be read by the DVD. One disc had visible microfractures. My review is about the quality of the used set, not the content."
1,Poor Production,Purchased the First Season when it first came out. Two of the disks were bad. Review your purchase timely.The West Wing - The Complete First Season
5,Best Show!,"Streams nicely, great awesome best show. You will want to be a White House staffer after you watch this show."
4,Great seires...,Quality series but what is up with all the walking and talking. Doesn't any one ever sit down for a meeting in this show ?
4,Great series!,"I have really enjoyed this series and it has helped to open my eyes to the processes in which politics work. I realize that there isn't quite as much sunshine and happiness as is shown on television, but I have learned more about the deal-making and backstabbing that goes on - they certainly didn't teach us about that in civics class (how old am I, right?) Anyway, what I thought was supposed to be a show about a noble profession has become just as drama-filled as any daytime soap opera. So, it's enjoyable to watch, there's lots of things going on, constant crises and hardly any of them have to do with running the country.I love it! LOL"
5,I second that 'WOW',"The wait is finally over. On November 18, the best show on television will be mass-marketed, hopefully opening the eyes of those who are not faithful watchers to the overwhelming power of the West Wing and maybe, just maybe, change American politics, making this awesome fairytale a reality."
3,Audio Commentaries not that great,"I am a huge West Wing fan and already had the first season on TiVo from the Bravo rebroadcasts. I was really looking forward to learning lots of inside information on the audio commentaries, but all I got was a bunch of schmoozing on how great the directors and actors are. I already know that!!! Hopefully the next seasons commentaries will be much better."
3,new viewer,"The picture quality was just OK. It wasn't crystal clear. There were rare pauses during viewing. I'll probably try other episodes to see if they are the same quality. If so, I'll find another media to view West Wing because the series was excellent."
5,Excellence in TV,"This is the single best television episode I have ever seen. The pathos of the underlying theme, that of the forgotten veteran is just absolutely heartbreaking and provoking.The series was excellent, and the writing superb, but this is the apogee, the episode you will remember for years afterword."
5,OMG!,"My wife and I have all 7 seasons, and they were well worth the price even if we did buy them used. We have quite the DVD collection, but The West Wing and Star Trek tops everything we own.Even though this is Hollywood at it's best, you still get a hard look into the making of political affairs and style of unspoken disasters we've all read about in the papers.What we do get to see here though is the cause to the effect that feeds our imagination and the desire for quality entertainment. What do people of power say when the cameras aren't rolling?The West Wing will go down in entertainment history as one of the most purchased series that has ever come out of Tinsel Town. (So will Star Trek!)"
5,Excellent!!!,I would STRONGLY recommend this book to anyone who likes a good murder/mystery. It is one of the best ones that I have ever read.
2,Disappointing,"I expected the book to be an interesting myestery regarding Emily Dickinson,one of the greatest poets. Despite of a suppoesedly fascinating idea for the plot, I found the story too scattered and lack of excitement. The author seemed to try too hard on character development while it should be done within the unfolding of the incidents. In other words,I was often unsure whether I was reading a mystery at all."
4,Solid Ol' Skool w/ Several Rarities...,"...it has the Dazz/Mo Bounce/Cutie Pie ubiquity I spoke of earlier, but I can excuse that Because it also has the rarities ""Sun Is Here"" by Sun, ""Riding High"" by Ohio Players protoges Faze-O and ""Firecracker"" by Mass Production. Thems definitely phonkay."
5,Just as shown,Just as shown.. went on very easy and realistic looking. Would recommend it to anyone..
3,Not good for boys,"I bought this seat for my 1-year-old son and ended up giving it to my niece. It might be fine for girls, but the splash guard does not come up high enough to prevent accidents with boys. And when the seat is placed on the large toilet and the bowl is removed, there is no splash guard whatsoever. It is stable, easy to clean, and makes a great step-stool. If you have a girl and want to save a few dollars, this might be the seat for you. However, for a boy I would recommend the Graco Soft Seat - it seems to offer the greatest protection."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"We bought this for my daughter. It was terrible from the start. The top kept seperating from the bottom ALL THE TIME. Then, the tabs just broke so now it will not stay on at all. We have a standard toilet yet the top does not sit on the toilet very well at all. We got it cause it was cheap and they didn't disapoint us on that part."
1,This potty is junk,"We bought this potty trying to save money, and we regretted it! The gap between the seat and the base pinched my son when he sat down on it, and he didn't want to use the potty any more because it hurt.Also, because of that gap, pee tends to get down in the base and make a yucky mess.The potty comes apart too easily, and I'm always worried that the top will separate from the bottom while my son is sitting on it.Moreover, the splash guard doesn't go up high enough, so he frequently pees on the floor.We're buying a Baby Bjorn."
1,Do NOT buy this!,My son put the middle part on his head wearing it as a hat... cute at first until he pulled it over his head and it wouldn't come off! We had to use hedge clippers to cut it off!
2,Boys Beware,"Like the other poster, this has not worked for our son (that's why I'm on Amazon, trying to buy a different one). I do disagree with the other review that says it's stable. Our son has tipped it over a number of times, just pushing himself straight up with his hands on the sides.For us it was a cheap emergency solution that we picked up at a local Walmart. But now we're ready for something that will contain him and will not tip over."
3,decent read,"this was an enjoyable read. i was lost a couple of times, but it was well written and all came togehter at the end. some slow parts then it had some parts that kept me turning the pages."
3,Wrong Listing,"There is another movie with the similar English title with Meng Fei starring.Amazon must be mixed up, so you sould be careful.Meng Fei is on the CAST list,but it's Lo Lieh on the cover.I can't rate this film because I have never watched Lo Lieh's.These two movies have another English title ""King Boxer"", the same again."
5,"Season 2: Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger","If you watched 3 minutes of any one show you might think this is the worst show on TV. It takes a little longer to appreciate the complexity of the underlying ideas the show brings.The creators are smart, the kids are fantastic (gotta love Trevor and Beat Kids), and the subjects are relevant. I think they must have been shocked when they were green lit for a second season. They played this one like they knew there was no way they would be asked for a third.Tackling issues like our constitution and the subversion of it, education, gun control, war, freedom of speech, slavery, racism, the meat market, TV and the common American idiot. They present these ideas for the MTV generation. A person can easily understand (and laugh), but are left with the overall message the story's portray, obviously or subconsciously.They make you laugh, they make you sick (even the cartoons), they get you talking and they make you think."
5,Great collection to season 1,"Very fast shipping, i remember back when they aired this on mtv 2, obviously an adult show but its so twisted i had to order it, i enjoy it and good pricing, thanks"
2,SAmsung mp3,"Item was better then describe, shipped promptly and was in good working condition.Thanks"
2,"Flash - Yes, but No, Not Really","I didn't actually buy this device, but I suggested it to a friend who did. He was very impressed by my IRiver U10 (now Clix) because of the Flash Games. Come to find out the device will only play the two games that come with the device. The flash files are part of the firmware and thus are not visible or removeable, and even more important, you CAN NOT add new games or programs. This is a shame because there are a growing number wonderful flash games and applications available. This was confirmed on the Adobe site, but is mentioned nowhere on the Samsung site or manual.If you want this MP3 player, buy it. It's really pretty and seems totally awesome other than this major oversight on Samsung's part. Hopefully Samsung will get it right and release a new firmware version that supplies the functionality advertised. For now my buddy will return his and I won't recommend it."
3,Love it until it died..,Great MP3 player but it croaked after 3 months... It cost my $8 to ship and get it fixed... Hope to get it back soon.... Miss it...
3,Just Ok,"Samsung YP-T9JQB, Downloaded music sounds great but I would not recommend it if you plan on using the FM radio. Reception is just awful in the gym and outside. I am thinking of taking this model back."
2,"it was good then, now its bad","I bought the T9 because it had all the features i wanted in an Mp3. and it worked pretty good for a couple of months. then the buttons started acting stupid, like when you press next song the current song would replay n things of that sort. then it took on aa whole new problem that forcd me to let it go. after listening to it for the first time after a charge, it will not shut off. upon turning it off it continuously turns back on, putting it on HOLD does nothing it will just keep lighting up HOLD till the battery died. i tryid reseting it n it worked the first time but never again. so aside from these probs the T9 is pretty good, but still BEWARE when buying the T9..."
3,Who rates Pop Tarts Anyway?,"Pop Tarts do the job if you are looking for low brow snacks. Product was exactly as advertised, decently packed and showed up when it was supposed to."
2,yuck spray leaked,when i got the product it was taped down and leaking everywhere. The product itself isn't bad but is cheaper if you go to the store and its not damaged.
1,Doesn't Work,"We have three dogs: a Beagle mix, a Pomeranian mix, and a pure bred Mastiff. They were chewing on our wood furniture and couch cushions. So, I bought this spray and applied it as directed. They kept chewing. So, I literally soaked the items with this stuff. They kept chewing.All this stuff accomplishes is two things:#1: It wastes your money. Let's face it, it's essentially water with some bitter rosemary extract in it. It's not exactly worth what they charge for it.#2: It coats everything in a very bitter-tasting spray. So, if you put it on anything you handle or lay on frequently, this stuff will eventually end up in your mouth. Not to mention the taste of the overspray when you apply it.Don't even bother with this. The only good thing I can say about it is that it is odor free.You're best of trying other methods to prevent chewing."
1,Nasty stuff,"I can't recommend this product at all. I bought it to stop my cat from eating cut flowers. After spraying the flowers my cat jumped right on the table and started chewing--he wasn't bothered at all. Meanwhile, I had the grossest taste in my mouth from the spray being in the air. Within a minute of spraying this my kids (who were in another room) began to complain of a nasty taste in the air. Even now, a week after using the product, I still get hints of it--it seems to be coating every surface in the house and anytime I touch something it clings to my hands. Definitely not recommended! I've used a bitter apple spray with great results. Only bought this because the shop was out of bitter apple and the sales person told me this was ""about the same"". It's not!"
1,Left Bitter Taste in My Mouth,Sprayed it on the newspaper in the driveway & let destructor-dog out. Five minutes late newspaper was all over the yard & I was still trying to get the bitter taste off my fingers. Waste of time and money.
1,My dogs can't get enough!,"Which is not a good thing. I purchased this product as I have a teething puppy who is chewing everything she can fit into her mouth. I was hoping Bitter Yuck would discourage some of the chewing, but I was finding that it wasn't. So to test it further I spayed a healthy puddle of it in the palm of my hand. The puppy went crazy over it and licked my palm clean. I called my adult dog over and the result was the same. He loved it as well. I tried a similar product (also water based) called Phooey. Both dogs went nuts over this product as well licking my palm clean. Lastly I tried some Bitter Apple. This one they didn't like at all, but dogs took a lick and pulled their heads back in disgust.While a nice concept, Bitter Yuck instead is an attractant and a treat. It encourages the exact behaviors it is marketed to prevent. At least with my two dogs, YMMV."
2,Didn't work,"I've heard from plenty of other people that this worked for their animals... but it didn't work for my dog. After we sprayed the things that we didn't want her to chew on, she would chew on the sprayed items!!"
1,Save your money,Don't even waste your time. This item is also a waste. My pup actually likes the taste.
1,Cats enjoy licking on the stuck,"This stuff does not work as described, my cat actually enjoys the flavor and licks the stuff off my hand ... it doesnt stop him from biting at all"
1,Made my literally ILL,"I have never written a review on Amazon before but after experiencing the horrible scent, gagging, and ultimately violent vomiting from just having inhaled some of this product I feel morally obligated to warn everyone against it. My puppy has licked but stopped chewing the 2 household items I sprayed this stuff on but the lingering, vomit-inducing scent isn't worth it. wow."
1,Did not work for my pets,We used this to try to keep our pet rats from chewing the plastic parts of their cage. We applied it every two days and it didn't deter them at all. We now have an all metal cage.
1,not worth it!!!!,this is not worth it. it did not work!!! we have a ten week old puppy and we sprayed it on the wall and he smelt it and started chewing the wall. the spray also affected our breathing. do not breathe it in!!!
2,YUCK!,This product did not work for my dog. She continued to chew! I think she liked it! So I did not like it and find Yuck to be YUCKY!!
3,try not to breathe!!!,"WOW, this stuff is strong, and incredibly airborne. Don't ever use it indoors. Even if you use it outdoors, you will probably end up breathing some in. Cover your mouth as best you can. I used this on my dog's fur, and it did stop her from biting herself backside raw, which is a good thing. The bad thing is that even a couple days after I spray it on her, the stuff gets in the air if I pet her, and I end up with that nasty bitter taste in my mouth. It's very strange, and uncomfortable. It gives me a headache too. So, the product works, but it ends up gagging you in the process."
2,"Bad for cats, great for kids!","Have a cat that chews on your fingers,wires , toys, or other things that they aren't supposed too? Well I can honestly say that this product isn't for you! Your cat will lick this foul spray, pause, and continue on with his nomming of your personal belongings.But wait, every time you use this disgusting liquid, an odorless spray will permeate through the air right into your nasal passage and mouth! Like bitter tasting yuk? Well, great! Because you'll be tasting it for hours and hours! Wash those hands and then wash them several more times!If a nonplussed cat and a noxious odor on your lips isn't enough to deter you from this product, I suggest using it for a far more sinister threat.KIDS. Once tasting this stuff, they wont touch or eat anything you spray it with. So if you DO buy this and don't follow through with the brands 100% money back guarantee, then have some fun with it (at your child's expense)."
2,frustrated,"I have a very ""busy"" 5 month old kitten.She is into anything she can reach, plays with or chews anything hanging, and defies me when I say no.The long wand that controls my blinds is her newest challenge. She licks where I applied Bitter Apple and likes the taste.I just applied Bitter Yuck, and tasted it to see what it was like.....BIG Mistake! I managed to get rid of the taste in my mouth with vinegar. However, that did not get rid of the taste where it got on my fingers.I tried vinegar, and clorine bleach and I can still taste the bitterness, if I lick my fingers! (Yes I know, that sounds dumb!)I worry that I can spread it to any food or item that I touch!Or if she licks my fingers.I don't want her to be afraid to come near me.Can anyone give me help with this?Susies ""mom"""
2,Effectiveness is minimal at best,"Bought a bottle of this a little over a year ago when our first beagle was going through her chew phase (a year later we've got a second beagle who's at the same point).The stuff tastes terrible. Occasionally when using it I'd somehow manage to get it into my mouth and it tastes kind of like... tires.But it didn't really stop our dogs from chewing on things. In fact, I remember one time where I sprayed some on a shoe and our beag went right over and resumed chewing on it. She made some strange faces and kind of smushed her mouth around oddly after I took the shoe away, so I think she NOTICED the taste, but it certainly didn't stop her from chewing.I'm giving it two stars just because I think it might discourage chewing, though I've little evidence of this."
2,Amusing,"Had to share this, as I could do nothing but laugh. I ordered this to spray on ""Sticky Paws"" that I put on the furniture to stop the cats from clawing. One of my cats LOVES the sticky stuff, and chews it off. So the Bitters seemed to be the solution. Put new 'Sticky Paws"" on couch, cat came immediately to inspect same. I said 'hah, I've got you now!"" Then watched as she proceeded to lick off (and seemingly enjoy) the bitters and remove the sitcky stuff."
3,Not all that great,It's OK. My 9 week old miniature schnauzer doesn't seem to care if something has been sprayed with this stuff or not. I won't be getting this brand again.
1,Noise level,The noise level when this product was on was blocking the sound from the TV in the same room....much too noisy to have in the house....it was taken back to the store for a quieter model from a different manufacturer.
1,Loud... WHAT? LOUD!,"My furnace went out this weekend and nobody was open with the part in stock so I went down to the store and picked up one of these babys from a local merchant to get by until Monday. To be brief, its going back. I have a Lasko tower unit that was running in the other room about 12 feet away and sitting next to the Lasko I could hear the Bionaire over it. Just hope I can sleep with it running in my room."
2,"Not Liberation Theology, but interesting reading","Claiming to be a discussion of Liberation Theology and the Peace Process, this book really addresses neither. Liberation Theology, a revolution of love to help the poor and oppressed, is conspicuously absent from this collection of facts and figures claiming that Jews and Israel control the media and the US government, and documenting Israeli human rights abuses. Aside from the conspiracy theories, this is a good account of exactly half of the Israeli-Palestinian situation, but for Liberation Theology or an even-sided description of the conflict, you'll have better luck looking elsewhere."
1,horrible-waste of money,after only two weeks of use coating coming off! now after six weeks every pan in set has coating coming off! totally worthless! i thought cuisnart meant quality..totally a waste of money!
4,I love this cookware,This was an excellent value. These pots and pans are a little lighter than I would like but they heat up quickly and evenly. The lids are glass and fit well. Clean up is a breeze and red is my favorite color! I'm really pleased with my purchase.
4,Good cookware,Definitely worth the money. A nice set for the price. So far so good on the non-stick surface. Love the color!
5,Great set at a great price,I just received my cookware today. Can't wait to use it. The reviews I read before I ordered were very helpful in making my decision to buy. I had bought a different set from somewhere else and was not half as pleased as I am with these. Looking forward to many great meals using my new cookware. Goes great with my kitchen decor. Fast delivery. Thank you Amazon for having great name brand selections at reasonable prices.
5,Wonderful set,"This has been a great set - it hasn't let me down! The non-stick surface is true to its word. It's easy to clean. The lids are inter-changeable which is convenient. I would have gladly paid more for this same set, it's worth it."
3,Should have listened to the other reviews,"I should have listened to the other reviews that I read. I only had the cookware for about 3 months and I did everything that I was supposed to do when taking care of them and cooking in them. I used the correct sponge to wash them, bamboo utensils and still the black coating came off!! I wouldn't recommend these to anyone!! Cuisinart is supposed to be one of the top brands but they missed the mark with this one!!!!"
4,Great basic set of pans...especially for the price!,"I purchased this set of Cuisinart pans for my Grandmother for Christmas this year. They were a ""Gold Box Special"" at 49.99 with free super saver shipping. Not a bad price for a 10 piece set! The glass lids, nonstick interior, silicone coated handles and red enamel color make this basic set definitely a keeper. My Gran was thrilled when she opened them! I washed them, put them away for her that evening and she had to show everyone how pretty they looked."
1,WARNING - DO NOT BUY THESE PANS,"These pans are a total waste of money. I bought a set less than two years ago and the non-stick finish is peeling off. The pans have been handwashed every time and nothing but nylon or wooden utensils used. I contacted Cuisinart and was told I could send them back at my expense to be ""evaluated"". The pans are not worth the postage and there is no guarantee that they would be replaced so I'll save my money and buy a different brand. I have stopped cooking in them because I don't feel they are safe with the finish peeling off. I wouldn't want to get it in my food."
3,coating wears off over time,"I purchased these 2 1/2 years ago, and am having to replace them becausee the nonstick coating has been coming off into my food. And where the coating has worn off the pans are showing signs of rust. Yummy. I have been careful not to scratch them. I have washed them in the dishwasher and cooked over hight heat, both of which may have contributed to the problem.These were wonderful at first and I was hoping that they would last me longer."
5,great for inexperienced cooks or young graduates,"I just moved into my own place without roommates so I defintiely needed my own pots and pans. I like this because it's everything I need to start off cooking on my own. It is definitely non-stick, lightweight but not cheap (i'm a small girl), and easy to wash. I'm not a gourmet cook or anything so this works out perfectly for me. A definite great gift for the young recent grad in need of starter house items."
1,Bad choice !!,"When I ordered this set, it looked good and promising. Within one month of using these pans the coating started to chip off ! Even after replacing it I have the same complaint. One of the worst sets I've bought ! Don't waste your money on it !"
3,"medium weight, good for the price","I paid $49 for this set on a Friday sale, and at that price it's a good deal. While the pans are not as heavy and durable as Circulon Commercial, they are comfortable to use, they cook evenly, and they clean up easily. The lids are excellent. The two large lids are interchangeable and fit the 10"" skillet as well as the stockpot and saute pan. (Unlike a prior reviewer, I had no difficulty peeling off the stickers.)"
1,not if you want to use it for more than a year,"I am now looking into contacting Cuisinart about the set I bought last December. The first set we got started shedding its non-stick cover within 2 weeks. Amazon promptly replaced it with another one. Now, a year later, I have thrown away all items except frying pans because of the same issue. Even though this set looks good, it does not have the quality to last more than one year."
4,Great product for the price at $40,"I bought this set when it was offered for sale at $39.99 by Amazon. It is a great set at that price, however, the price has risen to $149.00. I would be disappointed if I paid that much for it.I once thought that I would buy a more expensive set once my children grew up and left home but now that I'm older they are too heavy for me. This set is light enough not to aggravate the arthritis in my hands and sturdy enough to stand up to daily wear.The non-stick surface does a fantastic job and clean up is a breeze."
1,"LOWEST QUALITY POSSIBLE, DON'T BUY","Amazon forced me to give this product 1 star. It deserves 0. This crappy set of cookware has the non-stick surface peeling after only a few months of occasional use by a single guy. And I know how to take care of non-stick: no extreme heat, no metal utensils, no dishwasher, no de-glazing, no scotch-brite etc. I have had medium-low end sets (e.g. Club Aluminum) of cookware that lasted over 5 years. Cuisinart saucepan failed after 2 months. Frying pan failed after 3 months. I contacted Cuisinart service via their email function and never heard back. THIS IS THE LOWEST QUALITY POSSIBLE FOR COOKWARE. BUY IT ONLY IF YOU LIKE TO EAT TEFLON!"
4,Cookware,"I bought this product for $49.99. I love this set. The only thing I wish is that the lids (once turned upside down) were more condusive to stacking on top of the pans without sliding off. Other than that, they are a great set of pans."
4,Great Set!,"A great set of pots and pans! Let's see:(*) The surface is just like any other non-stick surface I used, except for the rivets that are not non-stick.(*) The rubberized handles are nice.(*) The glass lids are great, except that if the lid is hard, and you want to hold it upside-down in one hand while stirring the pans with the other hand so that the steam doesn't drip, the handle makes it hard to hold since they are not wide enough.(*) You can use them in the oven! However, at around 400 degrees, the handles get much more flexible than they should be, so I don't think I'll ever try baking in these pots and pans, despite the label on the box explicitly allowing me to.(*) The medium-dark red colouration is great!These a great for basic day-to-day cooking, and I don't regret bying this set at all. (Though because of the two shortcomings I mentioned above, the product only gets four stars.) Make sure to get some nylon spatulas, though!"
1,"Paint scratches off, non-stick coating flakes away","It wasn't even a year before the paint on the exterior looked horrible (all scratched up) and the non-stick coating began coming loose and flaking away. We had to throw away a few pots and pans already. In my opinion, this is junk."
2,Does not last long,"I wouldn't advise this set to anyone. It looked nice and frying pans are ok, however all the pots start ""shredding"" coating after a few months. I wouldn't recomment to anyone. I bought 6 months ago and now I'm having to look for replacement. :("
4,"Nice Set, Great Price","I bought this set for my daughter and she was pleased. It was at least $30-$50 cheaper than anything I could find comparable. My experience with previous Cuisinart sets is that the nonstick coating tends to be fragile, but I recommended to my daughter to use only plastic utensils and it should work fine."
2,Not - Great Value,"Initially this was my review: Great non stick Cookware. Its beautiful, easy to clean and comfortable to hold, I would definitely recommend this set!. However, after 5 months of use the nonstick started to peel off and I only use silicone spatula and non scratch scrub sponge!!! Just sent 2 pans to cusinart, had to pay for the shipping to send it and also send a $7 check so they can send me back the pans... Very disappointing!!"
3,Decent Set,"This is NOT a top of the line cookware set but its a decent set. Clean-up is a breeze, handles are very good, color ( red ) is very nice and they cook pretty evenly. I paid $39.99 for them when Amazon had them on a Friday sale so I'm happy. I wouldn't pay the $99.00 for them. Wait until they get marked down again."
1,Caveat emptor,"I am usually a big fan (and customer) of Amazon. But for some reason they think they can make up comparable retail prices. This is especially true in the kitchen area. They have knock offs of famous brands, or famous brands that have made a much cheaper version. Stupidly Sabatier, Cusinart and Corning are willing to damage their quality brand name to sell some extra sets. Don't be fooled. This isn't the stuff you are (should be) expecting. This set never sold anywhere for any prices near 260.00. It's a 39.95 set for ...well...39.95."
2,Poor quality,"I bought this non-stick set on Amazon's Friday sale at price $49.99. After I got the cookware set, they looks fine in red color. Ironically, the stickers on each non-stick pans are impossible to peel off. I soaked the smallest pan in warm water for several hours, it is still hard to remove it. After I scrub hard and remove part of the sticker,the glue left a white mark on the pan. What a non-stick cookware! Return it without using."
1,Peeling pans,"I hate to have to agree, but I had the same issue with the non stick surface of the pans. The set looks beautiful and appears of good quality as I would expect from Cuisinart, but after using them just a few times the non stick coating peeled right off. The last time we had scrambled eggs it looked like there was coarsely ground black pepper in the eggs when in fact it was the pan's peelings. Unfortunately I will not be using my pans anymore as I don't want to harm my family with my cooking!"
1,Buyer Beware,"I just read the poor reviews Cuisinart got for this cookware set and I have to agree because my mother had the same problem with her set which I gave to her as a birthday gift back in 2008. The red was lovely. The non-stick surface got easily scratched and the enamel coloring also chipped from the surface. In addition my brother turned up the heat when he used it so the cookware has a burned-up look to it. You can't raise the heat with this line (it said so in the product manual). I also saw that Amazon had it at a better price. I felt so jipped by my home shopping channel. Now I have to get my mother a new set, but not Cusinart. I thought I would get a quality product, but apparently I didn't, sorry Cuisinart."
2,Doesn't work well with glass-top stove,It's a nice set for an regular electric of gas stove top. I didn't like them with my glass-top stove. They have the groved bottom and I was afraid they might scrach my cooktop. I passed them on to our son who has a regular electric stove.
2,Would not recommend to my worst enemy!,"My husband and I purchased these exact pans and had to replace the set almost right away because the tefflon started peeling off. I thought it was a fluke, however with the replacement set it wasn't long before the tefflon started wearing off of the skillet. It was a horrible buy and we now know that you cannot go cheap with pans if you want them to last!"
4,GREAT!,"i got these for fitment on the civic 00 oem tweeter slot, they fited nice but was exted out just a little but i still like it, the sounds nice also + they come with capacitors."
3,BeATz,I recieved my pioneer tweeters 3 days later after I ordered them and I was happy to know that it was fast shipping. I opened them and everything looks good and their. I will not mentioned how they sound because I am ordering other pioneer products and I will be installing these bad boyz sometime in the ends of November.
1,Leaky POS,"I bought one of these because it looked like a good idea for cleaning and as to size. Unfortunately, it leaked around both the spigot and the seal. Save your money this is a POS."
2,Bad gasket seal,I can only store water standing upright. The gasket looks sound but continues to leak. Not worth the monies n time to send back though.
1,Doesn't Work,"I also got this for my son,7, for Christmas. It didn't work we can't use it or see anything. I am very disappointed. I would not recommend this for anyone."
4,Good for Beginners,This microscope is great for kids and adults alike. The viewing screen on the front is a neat feature on this scope that allows you to see a specimen clearly without being blinded by the light in the eyepiece!
3,Harmless,"As this is apparently discounted, I won't complain too much about its standard LP duration time. This is manages to be almost entirely electronic without being obviously cartoony, as most from this long ago tend to be. It has aged remarkably well, but I can't name a reason to choose it over new stuff. It's a pleasant listen, and even mildly inspirational."
3,So-so,"I would not recommend buying this book. The information covered in it is also covered in other books, but this one is exceptionally long-winded. On top of that, there is a plethora of typographical errors (which drive me absolutely nuts in a published, hardcopy book)."
5,Serious things to know,"I appreciated very much this book. It brings information that most of the times lack a serious background but not in this case. Anyway, there is always Pubmed if you want to go further. The only thing I could look with reserve is the interest conflict between the author and Neways. Said that, the book is useful, important and trustful. Read it, because you're worth it."
3,Unreasonable Risk,"Not nearly as helpful as the Safe Shopper's Guide. I was hoping for updated information on products like that one. However, it has just much more general information. It would significantly benefit by a list of chemicals to avoid that could be cut out and taken to the store."
4,Most informative,Very interesting and worthwile information about the negative health effects on our society as a result of the use of harmful chemical used in the manufacture of our everyday needs.
3,OK as far as it goes,"For those SQL*Plus keywords it contains, it's good. Very easy to use and helpful. What I'd really like to see is a more comprehensive reference that covers general SQL statements in SQL*Plus, without all the references to the other ""flavors"" of SQL out there (those weren't in this book, by the way). Exactly the same level of references found in the book now, but much more comprehensive, so I only need the one source for quick 'n' dirty query help. There were many SQL keywords and functions not found either here, or in The Complete SQL (not so complete, after all), making it difficult to move forward without looking elsewhere, like online using the search engine Copernicus."
5,Reviewing the Product not the packaging,"This is a great paper for the price, use it a lot for presentations and colors are sharp and pop off the page, Highly recommend! I find it to be a shame when someone gives a poor review to a product based on the shipping and packaging by another company, this has nothing to do with the product, leave a comment on the vendor profile so we know not to use them for anything they are selling not just this product."
5,Impressive Quality,"For the price, I was really impressed. This paper has a quality that is unbelievable. It's very smooth, thick and supple, almost glossy. I love it."
3,Terrible Packaging Effort from Amazon,"Rating this as the total experience -I like the paper a lot (and I'm fussy). It prints nicely on my Canon Pro 9500 Mark II. I like the extra bit of thickness.But just as someone else complained here, the paper arrived with its immediate packaging completely open as though someone might have taken some paper out for themselves. That was my first reaction though am sure it was just that it had too much space to bop around in the box in transit. There was barely anything to hold it in place in the Amazon box.None of the sheets arrived with crumples but still... I like it in its original paper cover keep it clean while stored. I might just get it elsewhere even if it means paying more the next time.Maybe if enough people complain..."
2,Hammermill 10254 11x17,"When I received the product ""Hammermill 10254-1 Hammermill Color Copy Paper, 28-lb., 11 x 17, Photo White, 500-Sheet Ream"" , I found it is all taped up with Scottch tape and the cover was partially open. I am often pleased with the packing of Amazon.com except this one. I was a bit surprise."
5,Dig up the DJ!,"If you can find these- snap them up! I have had these compilations for years- I think they only made three of them. (1986, 1987, and 1988.) I have owned them for longer than I care to admit. They survived years of heavy rotation in my CD changer, and I had to stage covert operations to snag them back from over-enthusiastic borrowers more than once.Between the three discs, a lot of great material is covered- I guarantee you'll re-discover some old favorites. If you're a fan of New Wave 80's stuff, and are familiar with the usual stale offerings of the standard compilation discs- these will be a refreshing surprise.I highly recommend all three of these CD's, and you might also want to take a look at the MTV's 120 Minutes compilations, which date back to when MTV actually had- GASP!- decent programming."
4,If you like this stuff...,"I bought this CD after hearing my friend's favorite tracks, which were:""Panic"" -- The Smiths""Cities In Dust"" -- Siouxsee & The Banshees""Pretty In Pink"" -- The Psychedelic Furs""Peter Gunn"" -- The Art Of Noise""Walk Like An Egyptian"" -- The Bangles""Weird Science"" -- Oingo BoingoNow, aside from those tracks, the CD pretty much stinks. Still, It's worth buying for those tracks....If you like that kind of stuff. If you don't, then don't buy it, but it's your loss."
2,Too small!,"Too small, and hard to catch. Material is perfect, but since it is hard to catch it does not make for a fun game."
4,Plenty of basics on Pilates workouts,"Beginners should start with RAEL PILATES SYSTEM 7, a survey of the seven basic Pilates positions essential for training. Beginners receive a thorough exploration in visual demonstration and words of how Pilates workouts and techniques are achieved."
3,Rael Pilates: System 7,"I had never tried Pliates before and I read alot of reviews for alot of different DVD's and decided on trying this DVD. The first time I tried the DVD I was confused with the breathing instructions. I gave up, ordered another DVD and tried that one. This DVD, although I didn't have to try and understand the breathing instructions (none were given) was so fast that I could not keep up. I went back and tried the Rael Pliates again and now I am hooked. I have found this DVD to be a great teaching tool for the true Pilates beginner such as myself. I never feel rushed, I can understand the movement and now I can understand the breathing. It is definately a great DVD for the Pilates beginner and I highly recommend it!"
1,Very Disappointing,"I bought Rael Pilates System 7 online without knowing much about pilates. I finally got the chance to use it today and while I was feeling the different movements I was being walked through and was getting into it and ""feeling the burn"" it suddenly stopped. It was at best a 10 or 15 minute work out. I then read the back of the DVD (something that had not been mentioned when I bought it) and it said that you needed to buy 2 other DVD's to get the rest of the workout.I recommend pilates because like I said, I was definetly into the workout but I do NOT recommend this particular one. Spend the extra couple of bucks or you will regret it like I did!!"
4,Dolphins and Porpoises: A goldmine of information!,"I can't keep track of how many people I've met that love marine mammals; especially dolphins and porpoises. If you too are interested in these amazing creatures, I highly recommend this book. Dolphins and Porpoises is a book with the straight facts. Unlike other scientific books, Dolphins and Porpoises is easy to understand, but still gives you the information that you need. It is ideal for research, or pleasure reading. There are also many descriptive diagrams to explain slightly hard-to-grasp concepts on dolphins and porpoises. Dolphins and Porpoises is a wonderful book. I would reccomend it for all ages."
5,Wonderful Book,My eight year old daughter loves this book! She insists on reading it to new guests as soon as they enter the door. I love the back page that humorously tells you the real details of our early American history.
5,"John, Paul, George & Ben",Wonderful childrens book and adorable illustrations. Cleverly written. Fun for all ages.
2,Another kids' book for adults,"Bad history is only corrected in tiny notes at the back of the book; the book almost makes fun of these giants of American history. Paul Revere is depicted as a store clerk selling underwear, when in fact he was a master silversmith whose pieces are still considered masterpieces and sell for commanding prices today. As far as that goes, could you buy underwear then, or did people sew it at home? It also laughs at that era (""before fun was invented""); adults can understand that none of this is to be taken seriously, but what child would get it? Furthermore, why shouldn't our history be presented to small children as serious business, and these people as figures to admire? ""1776"" is great fun for adults, but unsuitable for kids of the age that this book is marketed to."
5,what a fun read,"I wavered between a four star and a five star rating because thisbook is going to be perhaps more entertaining to adults than tochildren. But then I reminded myself of the movie ""Ice Age""which requires a whole lot more knowledge to ""get it"" than the vast majority of kids have (not to mention, many adults) and yet kids, including my five year old granddaughter, love it.What this book does give is little snippets of information whichthe kids will remember as they are officially learning their history years later. And there is plenty of humor to go around.What little tykes can resist laughing at the phrase ""please shut your big yap"" when it isn't being yelled at them but rather at someone famous!I think this is the sort of book that children will want to hearagain and again, and the good reader will fill in a blank hereand there so that the listeners can learn some real historyalong the way. Finishing off the session by listening to ""YellowSubmarine"" wouldn't hurt either."
5,best historical fiction i've ever read,"it's hilarious, visually stimulating, and enough of the true fable of these guys to still make sense and make learning history nearly-cool. (well, the book is cool enough so the ""nearly-cool"" is negated.)(even the dedication is great... ""with a little help from my friends..."" so brilliant.)well done, mr. smith. i love it love it love it."
5,Who said kids' books can't be entertaining AND educational?,"John, Paul, George & Ben (and did I mention Tom?) by Lane Smith is a great book for kids. It deals with historic characters:John Hancock - you can read his signature from space!Paul Revere - he had a loud voice (because of bad hearing)George Washington - overly honest?Ben Franklin - free with advice (Townsfolk suggestion, ""Please shut your big yap"").Tom Jefferson - well, he was an independent lad!The art is nifty, the organization wonderful. This is not as poetic as Dr. Seuss, but children should find it just as entertaining. Why? Because John, Paul, George & Ben (and Tom) were kids before they became historically important figures.I also like the true and false section at the end. Here's an example:""Besides inventing clever sayings, Ben also invented bifocals, the Franklin stove, the lightening rod, and Playstation..."" True, except for Playstation!This is a great book to give to your favorite child."
5,"John, Paul, George and Ben","I don't ususally write reviews, but this book was so good that I had too. My 7 year-old loves it and asks to read it over and over. It's a great book to introduce history to our children, so light and so funny. I only wish the author would write more history books likes this for the kids!"
2,Its ok.....,"I rented it from the library and was admiring the front page and then when I opened the book. I was surpised at how non-educational it was. It tells false stories about John,Paul,George & Ben. I couldn't belive it. I would not reccomend this to any person willing to learn something about the presidents and american heroes."
1,Awkward and Useless item,"Why buy this heavy and limited utility stand? The drum machine it is intended for can be easily mounted on an average snare drum stand, which will afford you much more flexibility and portability."
5,Valve lifter tool,This tool is required if your engine has some stuck lifters. I was unable to change the ones on my Jeep without this tool. Tool made it easy.
5,Cool concept for a YuGiOh Book,Pojo takes a cool concept for a book and runs with it!This book primarily focuses on the LON set (Labyrinth of Nightmare). They show an image of every card in the set. 4 pros then review and rate all 100+ cards in the set individually. A really good read! Way better than what Beckett's and other lame-oh magazines are doing.They also have a lot of Killer Decks and Top 10 Lists from all the other sets.I hope they keep making books like this for every set! This one is a fun read!
3,"Severely outdated, but still fun to read.","This book is pretty old, but it's not too bad. A good guide to the booster set. Some of the writing could use editing as there are several misspellings and grammatical errors throughout the book."
2,"A great movie, a terrible DVD","WERCKMEISTER HARMONIES is my favorite movie of the decade. The story is compelling and terribly relevant, and the photography is eye-popping beautiful. The deliberately slow pacing creates a compelling sense of reality, which makes the outbreak of chaos at the end all the more shocking.But this DVD is a disaster. Facets seems to have simply duplicated the Region 2 DVD, resulting in blurriness, artifacting, and visible interlacing all over the place. It's a crime to treat such a gorgeous movie to such a pathetic DVD transfer. Facets should be ashamed of themselves, and they should hand the movie over to someone who will give it the DVD it deserves."
1,Too many Typos and Errors to learn ASP.NET,"I am totally disappointed in this book. I was very anxious to learn ASP.NET and I wanted to find an inexpensive book to help me get started, but the only thing this book did was frustrate me with horrible examples. Almost every single example in the book contained an error. Very disappointing."
2,ASP.NET - The Hard Way,"What's the difference between ASP and ASP.NET? According to this book, it's just syntax. There are lots of code samples here but the book has you entering most of it by hand. What you, the developer, need to learn is how to cooperate with the .NET IDE to create ASP.NET applications - you won't learn enough of that here.Furthermore, subjects like SSL, Trace Debugging, E-mail functionality and File Streaming come too early in the course while database access comes in too late.There is some useful information on setting up the web environment, registering an SSL Certificate, working with XML and there's a whole chapter on File Streaming. But overall, it's not a bargain - even from the bargain rack.Note: This is not the same book as that by the same title but authored by Scott Mitchell."
3,"OK for beginners, too many typos","The overall coverage was OK for developers looking to get a glimpse of what ASP.NET is about. However, the publishing of the book was rushed and filled with typos. I downloaded the source code from the Sams web site to attempt to follow along with the examples in the book only to be disappointed with code that did not follow the examples in the book. Even with the typos and inconsistent downloaded code, the book gave me a general understanding of what ASP.NET was about. My next step is to purchase an ASP.NET book from Wrox."
1,Waste of money!,"This was supposed to come with a screen protector, but it didn't!! It doesn't even close properly! It's a nice looking case, but that's about it. What I want is a case that at least protects my ipod and closes properly! I asked for a refund. If you ordered it and aren't happy with it, do the same."
2,Belt clip is junk,"I bought this specifically to add a belt clip to my 5th gen iPod 30 GB. The tab that secures the belt clip broke, so the clip now easily slides off of the case. This is nice if you want to put it in your pocket, but not nice if you want the iPod to stay on your belt.If you want an ipod case with a good belt clip, this isn't the one you want. Keep looking."
2,ehhh,"I guess it is good, because it was cheap, but def not as good as I thought it was going to be. I am not a big fan of the hinge on the side and the fact that it dosen't really close perfectly."
5,GREAT!!,I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!! IT DOES MAKE THE IPOD BIGGER BUT I LOVE IT. IT PROTECTS IT AND DOES NOT LOOK HALF BAD.
2,Poor Production Value,"The music of Aimee Mann is thing of total beauty. The producers did not contribute to this. The production is simply awful. Listen to a Sheryl Crow album which fits similarly in the same genre - there is no comparison. The production value is amateurish, sloppy and not mastered well. They really should have recorded her in a studio by herself with a guitar and that's it. The arrangments are simply inaudible to the point of being a nuisance. Aimee's voice is highly unique and has a quality to it that takes a moment to read. I don't think the engineers understood this. I will attempt to return the CD. But I doubt that I will be successful... Long live Napster!"
4,"Beautiful voice, beautiful music...beautiful","I had heard ""Save Me"" at the Academy Awards and I knew I had to get the CD, and eight months later I finally got it. I put the CD in and immediately skipped all the previous eight tracks and went straight to ""Save Me"", pure beauty. But over time, I started listening to the other, well, they too are pure beauty. She has so much to say about love, life and death and all of it. Anyone who enjoys a beautiful voice, some good acoustic music and some good soft rock should get this CD. The only let down is ""Dreams"" by Gabrielle, does not fit at all and is very annoying and breaks the whole album up. But the two tracks by Supertramp are fun and good nostalgia of the late seventies, and the orchestarted song ""Magnolia"" by Jon Brion gives you a good feel of the soundtrack and the film itself. Pure beauty, get this one."
5,Good exercise CD,"There is no tiring from this sound track. Fine tunes with gentle reminders of the film to hold them together such as Tom Cruise saying ""Ok Mr. Nix"" and that game show guy saying ""And now we're ready for round two!""Supertramp and Aimee Mann. What a duo! I never get tired of ""Driving Sideways"", and ""Wise Up"" is sort of a mantra for straightening out your life.This is good music. Bravo!"
5,The danger of overplaying it had me worried at first...,"but I've had this album for months and neither my husband nor I get tired of hearing it. When nothing else will do, this album is so complete. Each song is full in Aimee Mann's multi-level sounds, her thoughtful lyrics, and her refreshing intonations. There's nothing unoriginal about her sound. Take ""Deathly"", the upbeats come just when you settle into a nice satisfying melody and expect a pause. Her version of ""One"" is lovely and she makes all her own. ""Wise Up"" ""Save Me"" and ""Build That Wall"" have meaningful lyrics and addictive melodies. This is why I don't grow tired of this album, there are always more levels and angles to hear this album."
5,Powerful stuff....,"Okay, i'm really really into hard rock and stuff...so this is a big difference from what i normally listen to. But this cd is absolutely great. Aimee Mann has an amazing voice and the songwriting is like no other. A great companion piece to an excellent film. ""Wise Up"" and ""One"" are the best songs on here. But what I don't get is why people are saying bad stuff about the Supertramp songs....they rule.....""Goodbye Stranger"" is such an awesome song....."
4,A Great Way to Remember a Great Film,"MAGNOLIA was one of the best films of 1999--devastating and true and glimmering with hope. The ensemble cast of brilliant actors--Julianne Moore (pill-popping perfectionist), William H. Macy (closeted gay child prodigy), Tom Cruise (male chauvinist guru), Philip Seymour Hoffmann (pensive male nurse)--were displayed perfectly against a fascinating, weird story. And those frogs! They were the finishing touch to an equally inexplicable day. Aimee Mann's songs are the perfect way to remember the film. I can just listen to ""One"" and replay the film's opening in my head, as the flower petals unravel and the story begins. ""Wise Up""--the song sung by all of the characters in the film, in another great, odd touch--is positively beautiful. ""Save Me"" is also great as it sums up the film in which everyone needs saving. Both the film and album are infectious, different, and creative."
4,Top-notch Aimee Mann,"If you're familiar with Aimee Mann, her work on this CD meets or exceeds the high standards set on 'Whatever' and 'I'm with Stupid.' It's slightly softer, with more emphasis on her voice than in past recordings. If you're among the uninitiated, you'll be floored by her intelligent lyrics, poignant themes and wonderful harmonies.Because this is a sountrack, two old Supertramp cuts and some other ecclectica are included at then end; I usually skip by them. However, Aimee's 8 outstanding songs make this CD well worth the investment."
5,Wow. Wow. Wow,"Ever since a friend of mine sent me a copy of this soundtrack, I literally cannot stop playing it. I am heretofore hooked on Aimee Mann. I am now setting myself out to buying her other albums. I can't get over the beauty and honesty in her songs. They're simply addictive. Very reminiscent of my favorite songwriters, Lennon and McCartney. I've always loved true singer/songwriters and I'm so glad to have discovered Aimee Mann. Why aren't there more singer/sonwgwriters like her? And why don't we hear this stuff on the radio! This is MUSIC, people! Give it a listen."
5,The Best of the Movie,"Aimee Mann has really outdone herself with the selection of songs for this soundtrack. Her voice, haunting in selections such as Nilsson's ""One"", ""Save Me"" and ""Wise Up"" evoke some of the movie's best moments. This CD makes for perfect background music and is very moving. The addition of two of Super Tramp's best songs, ""Dream"" and ""Magnolia"" round out the CD, but it's Ms. Mann's songs that lend the album an unforgettable haunting quality."
5,Perfect companion to the film,"I've always liked Amy Mann--not loved--but after seeing ""Magnolia,"" I went directly to the record store and picked up the soundtrack. Her haunting vocals and emotional lyrics add a layer of depth to the film it would otherwise be without.... I'm not sure how I'd feel about the movie without the music, but with it, it's a wonderful experience. And now, I do indeed love Amy Mann. This is a record everyone should own."
4,"A lovely, lonely and thoughtful collection","I've been an Aimee Mann fan for years, and for others like me, this CD is a true must. Mann's voice has never sounded as sweet -- or as fragile -- as it does here, and there's something wistful about her performance, as if, like the film's characters, she's wishing for something she's not sure she deserves. In addition to the lovely, fragile optimism of the Oscar-nominated ""Save Me,"" every single song on this disk is a keeper, offering a depth and intelligence those ex-Musketeer navel-barers can only dream of (her performance of opening cover song ""One"" is worth the purchase-price alone). Whether you love Mann, or loved the movie and can't get those songs (or frogs!) out of your head, you won't be disappointed by this collection."
4,"Good ""One"" by Aimee Mann and Jon Brion","""Now that I've met you/would you object to/never meeting each other again"". Opening lines don't get much better than that one from ""Deathly"". This is my first Aimee Mann album (I know it's a soundtrack, but basically it's an Aimee Mann album), and it is a very good album. The music is melodic and rich and sets a mood throughout the album. Mann's voice is rich and emotion filled, making it a worthy listen. I actually liked the ""One"" cover. However, Supertramp and Gabrielle weaken the album (they belong because they were in the movie and this is a soundtrack). However, don't let these songs stop you from listening to the last song on the disc, ""Magnolia"" by Jon Brion.I would also recommend that if you like the album, especially the final song, go check out jonbrion dot com and his album meaningless. Amazon does not carry it yet."
4,GREAT CD!!,"This is a really good CD. I loved Aimee Mann when she was the lead singer for Til'Tuesday & she is still great. I really like the songs...One & Wise Up. The Supertramp songs on the CD are an added bonus. If you liked the songs in the film, you'll love the CD Soundtrack!!"
5,Gotta Have It,"I Loved this CD! I bought it, listened to it right away, and kept it on for 3 hours! It's awsome and Aimee Mann is a fantastic singer and song writer."
4,Trash the Super Tramp,"The movie turned me on to Amiee Mann, and this album hasn't left my changer in a month. I've since listened to ""Stupid"" and ""Whatever"", but this is special. She's breaking out. Listen to the old Nilson chestnut ""One"", again and again."
5,magnolia is a soundtrack not to be missed!,"aimee mann has a wonderfully sweet, yet potent voice. which goes wonderfully with her meaningful lyrics."
3,Moody.,"I bought this album on the basis of other reviewer's comments. However, after listening to it I am not sure if I like the entire album. Momentum is definitely my favourite being very catchy and sublimely jazzy. But the rest seem to be a mish mash of ""Vonda Shepherd(?)-like"" songs. However, I can see how these songs could appeal to those who are in the mood for them(they are't bad songs-just not my cup of tea)."
2,"aimee ""beattles"" mann","in the liner notes of ""Magnolia"" Paul Anderson feels that he has heard these songs before. No kidding? That's because her songs aren't all that creative and mann sounds like she wants to join a Beattles reunion tour. I think the majority of this problem comes from the production work of John Brion, who tends to make everything into one big mess( i.e. Fiona Apple 2nd record, Rufus wainwright, etc.) I'm not blaming him liking the Beattles, I blame him for not being innovative enough to break things up more. But I did like the song ""Driving Sideways"" produced by Mann and Rage Against the Machine producer brenden O' Brien, who I think, is much more versatile than Brion."
3,Aimee Mann -Hush-Hush,"I listened to this recording and was taken back to 1985 when Aimee Mann, then called 'til Tuesday opened for Hall and Oates on tour. She was a one-hit wonder then and has not done much to improve her talent. I still remember her video from ""Voices Carry"" and the only thing that has changed is the little queue at the back of her head. Her voice still carries but it is not entertaining."
2,Not worthy,"Aimee Mann is talented, but her work on THIS record is disappointing. The uptempo numbers are grating and the slower ones seem to drone on forever. There are also two Supertramp songs here. The throwaway pop song by Gabrielle actually comes as a relief by the time you get to it. Of all Aimee Mann's work, this is the least impressive."
2,D's,"This entire soundtrack is incredibly disappointing, depressing and dull. Aimee Mann has more talent than this. It just DRAGS. There are one or two tracks that do NOT make you want to throw yourself out a window, but that's about it."
3,no harrry,"i dont like harry nilson because i dont like what he did with that badfinger tune either so i dont care about ""one""all the amiee songs though are pretty cool"
1,Aimee Mann is SO Whiney!,"My roommate has this album on her computer and listens to it all the time... it was okay the first few times i've heard it but now that i've heard it a million plus times, i can say one thing for certain... Aimee Mann's voice is just whiney and annoying and the music style is the same... makes me wonder if Ms. Mann shaves her armpits!if you are brain dead enough to like Alanis Morresette or Ani DeFranco... then this album is for you!"
1,this cd is the cheesiest...almost as lame as the movie.,"the cd is sentimental and cheesy...I still can't believe the scene in the movie where everyone left their character and decided to sing along to that bogus Aimee Mann song....if you are really into neutral chick rock, this album may suit you, but if you have any taste at all...you'll scrap it."
4,Magnolia,"I must concur with other reviewers - the Mann stuff rules, the other stuff is a waste. Definitely worth learning how to program the CD player for this one."
4,Aimee Mann and Rasputina sound amazingly alike!,"Ive seen the movie Magnolia for the first time recently, and I heard the wonderful music in the backround...So I knew whoever it might have been, I had to buy it. Mann's voice rings in your head with great passion. If you like Rasputina, you certainly will like Aimee! I reccomend this CD strongly along with her other cds!"
5,beautiful!,"Most of this soundtrack is songs from aimee mann.I went to see the movie not knowing who she was,but after the movie i went to buy the soundtrack.Aimee mann has a wonderful voice and she's just as good on the guitar.It also has a couple of songs from supertramp.overall an excelleny cd.Try it,you won't be dissapointed."
4,Wonderful,"I only vaguely knew who Aimee Mann was before seeing ""Magnolia"". The soundtrack knocked me out more than the film. It's really got everything I like in songs, composition-wise, sound-wise and lyric-wise. I know I'll listen to these songs of Aimee Mann's for years. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is I can't stand Super Tramp! And this CD also has two ancient Super Tramp songs. But, fortunately, they are at the end of the album, so you can listen to the Aimee Mann stuff straight through."
5,An Honor to Mann,"If you have never listened to Aimee Mann before and you're into female musicians (perhaps Sarah McLachlan or Ani DiFranco?), I am sure that you will like this CD. Ignore the Supertramp songs--this CD is all about Aimee and is worth every penny for her 9 songs alone. You will be charmed by her voice and inspired by her lyrics. She's incredible. If you already are familiar with Aimee--don't waste any more time and buy this CD. This includes some of her best work ever."
1,"Too many, too little","This is a very disappointing book. It tries to cover a very broad and very disconnected area of the United States. There are nine states crammed into its pages and each state hardly gets any coverage. A lot of great attractions, restaurants and lodgings are missed as this book tries to cover from Oregon to Iowa! In order to be a helpful travel guide, it should be split into a least two volumes. As it is right now, it is not worth the money."
4,A chilling look into Hawaii's supernatural traditions.,"As a college student on the mainland I, like most students, have been required to read thousands of pages of text that at times puts me to sleep. This book on the other hand will do just the opposite. It will make you wonder and question what we call reality. Grant takes Hawaii's rich history of oral communication and legendary tales , and combines them with recent unexplained experiences of ordinary people to give the reader that unique feeling that comes with ghost stories. I recomend this book to anyone who loves to hear tales of odd occurances and to those readers who love to hear a a good story told by a master storyteller. The editing in this book isn't perfect and to understand all the ""local"" terms will take some time but it's well worth it for the supernatural enthusiast. If you're anything like me, you have a hard time looking in your rear view mirror at night or even going to sleep after reading a few of his stories."
5,Glen Grant has done it again!,"Obake Files is a book based soley upon the supernatural legends of ancien Hawaii such as choking ghosts, nightmarchers, and 8 ghost photographs. A book highly reccomended for those late nights alone!"
5,"Read at night, and look at the skin on the back of your hand","That's what Hawaiian's call ""chicken skin""! You can't read a short page like ""A Strange Encounter in Lahaina, 1927"" (pg.48) without feeling that these are wonderfully unvarnished, collected archeologigal gems. Photos in back are quite interesting, as well."
2,Meh,"While this book has a lot of interesting stories, I just didn't like the style of writing. I just expected better (less boring) story-telling."
4,Iceberg Loung Penguin at last!!!,"I kept waiting for Amazon to post a picture of this set before I ordered, but I decided to just go ahead anyhow, and was I ever glad that I did! The bat gang is painted a bit strange, Batman actually looks like a comic book version though... The entire gang is wearing grey tights, black gloves, and black boots. This look actually is not bad on Batgirl, but on Nightwing it is a bit odd. The creme de la creme of the set would have to be the Penguin. I was not fond of the series' earlier attempts at making him look like the DeVito version, and was hoping for a better figure towards the end of the Hasbro run. Mattel surely came through this time, and for any bat fan this is truly a must have!"
5,Hurrah for the Penguin!,"After years of waiting, someone in America has made a great Penguin figure! Like many, I wasn't thrilled with the earlier version of one of my favorite characters, and I was even less thrilled that only one figure of him was released. How many Joker varients did we see? Not to mention the plethora of Batman varients. But at long last, Mattel has given us an animated New Adventures Penguin, complete with an umbrella! My only complaints are that he can't hold the umbrella in either hand and that the figure is only available in an exclusive 4-pack from Toys R Us. To some, it might be a bit pricey just to get one figure, but for those of us who waited so long for a good figure of the Penguin, it's well worth it. The other three figures (Batman, Batgirl, Nightwing) aren't too shabby, and the color scheme (gray and black) look pretty good. If you have the chance, buy this set!"
1,Maybe if it was free.,"No real data on trails, length, campsites, how to get permits, etc. Just clip after clip of each trail. No voice over explaning what your seeing just crappy music. If you are trying to see how dangerous the Kalaula trail is don't waste your money. Just buy a book."
3,"had high hopes, but...","After reading the reviews of this DVD, I was excited to relive the beauty of being on this island. I was only in Kauai for 4 days this summer, and did not have the opportunity to go on any hikes. The DVD spends little time showing the views, and I would have thought the content would be more like the ""not to be missed"" section (or some name to that effect). That part had nice photos but again, too short. The background music is sometimes annoying and distracts from the visual instead of enhancing it."
2,short life,"I'm glad to see they've dropped the price on this battery from $10 to $3.50. They worked fine the first couple times I used them, but now they won't hold a charge at all. I just threw them away. Spend your money on something more reliable."
2,Not Very Impressed,"You get what you pay for with this... for a quick back-up battery, this may be a good alternative to spending $40+ on a spare canon battery, but I strongly urge anyone who gets this to have a better battery as their primary because it's probably not going to be a reliable item for lots of shooting.I bought this as a back-up, and while it initially worked well, it wasn't long(maybe a week) before it started holding less and less charge, and then just died altogether. I wasn't horribly upset, because I'd only spent a few dollars on it, and knew what I was getting, but it would have been nice if it had held out for longer than a month."
3,"Last Christmas, I gave you my heart...","A good remake that respectsthe original. I had the opportunity to watch both versions of the movie over the weekend and while this remake is the lesser of the two, it is much better than most remakes.It gives a back story to Billy that was completely missing in the original and is fairly well done.I appreciated the pacing and tension and the over-the-top gore was appreciated in this day of PG-13 horror.The problem with the movie is in the writing. The characters act so stupidly in the name of scares that it frustrates the viewer. They don't even try to call the cops when they should, then when they do the explanation of why the police can't make it is unbelievable and a character that is chased through a crowded building 'forgets' to scream.Still, it's worth a rent if you don't mind screaming 'Oh, come on!' at the screen from time to time."

2,Good thing it ws cheap.,"This movie was cheap but not quite cheap enough. In my opinion, they should have paid us to watch it. It was that bad. Couldn't even finish it."
1,PATHETIC,"What is with this recent need to create back-stories for psychopaths? Am I supposed to be stirred by the poor-pitiful-me exposition? I wasted 90 minutes watching this drivel and don't want to spend much more time even thinking about it, but here's the scoop:* the killings are ridiculous and implausible (the icicle impalement and death by thrown ice skates in particular are howl-worthy and, let's see...IMPOSSIBLE)* characters are lame and of course act in typical ""bad horror film"" fashion (although when one loses an eye, the natural response SURELY MUST BE to want to eat all the eyes of your victims) ??!!!??* and are we actually supposed to believe that the killers are body bagged and taken to the morgue with no one ever noticing that THEY'RE NOT REALLY DEAD?!Sometimes bad horror can be good -- alas, this is merely bad horror. Period.Shame on Andrea Martin and Bob Clark for having anything to do with this pathetic mess."
1,A Christmas Clunker...,"My husband and I went to see this in the theater during the holidays and I LOVED the original. I enjoy horror movies , especially holiday-themed horror, and I wanted to like this movie. But we got up and left within 15-20 minutes after the movie started. It was extremely disappointing.I highly recommend the original Black Christmas however---it's scary and atmospheric and it's one you don't want to miss!"
3,Blood-Red Christmas!,"Put your brain on 'low hum' and enjoy this extremely gory take on the '70's classic! Very reminiscent of early 80's slasher pics (especially the 'Friday the 13th' films), this is a brainless, trashy, and especially FUN movie which exploits (to very good, atmospheric effect) all the trappings of Christmas to tell the tale of little Billy and his very, very sick family.This is by no means a great film, or even a particluarly good one, but again if you're looking for a fast-paced, never boring, bloody good ""slay ride,"" you've found the right picture! Just don't expect anything like the original or you will be sorely disappointed...A guilty pleasure if there ever was one, and definitely recommended for gore hounds!"
2,See the original instead.....,"When are certain filmmakers going to learn that you don't mess with horror classics?? Quit doing remakes and if you do do them,do it right! Do something different or something fresh with it,ok?? If anyone of you out there that has never seen the original,rent it and then compare.Also,read up on a movie,if you're not sure about it,find out if there's an original out there and then watch it first.Don't be afraid to watch something that's ""old"",even if it was only made in the 60's or 70's or 80's..Don't bother with this at all."
1,Rating Based On The Worst 45 Minutes Spent Watching Anything,"First, all the chicks are attractive but all look the same. I'm sure there is someone out there who knows their names and the films they've been in. That person, however, is not me. Also, this film has some undefinable 'gross' quality to it that makes it just unappealing. Maybe it was the certain sex scene implied about 30 minutes in that kind of finished this movie for me. Stupid dialog, lame delivery of that stupid dialog, no character you care about in even the slightest of ways...the list goes on. And while I really didn't have any clue as to who the killer or killers might have been, and while there might have been some incredible 'surprise' ending, I stopped caring long before I stopped the DVD. But the Christmas lights were colorful."
4,Holiday Horror,"I'm not here to compare the original to the remake, so I want to go on to explain why I think this movie is pretty good. Is there gore? Yes. Is there action? Yes. Are the actors good? Yes. Does the movie do a good job at portraying the cheery and eerie holiday feeling? Yes. I certainly enjoyed it. It didn't take FOREVER to get into things and show some gore. The movie was well done, and the bodies pile up quickly like they should in a slasher movie. It's worth it to add this movie to your collection if you're a true slasher movie fan. I enjoy holiday based movies and gore, so this was the best of both worlds for me."
3,kinda lame,"This movie drags... It does however have some good parts where you jump and a few gross parts but not enough...To me its soft core horror.. def not gross like hostel or the saws, even wolf creek was better...If its on cable its worth watching.... but dont buy it."
2,Black Christmas is just a goofy gory version,"When Bob Clark gave us the original back in the 75 and threw a young Margot Kidder in as a boozing sorority sister who along with the rest are being terrorized by a killer living upstairs in the attic his intentions were to give us a scary movie and not much blood.As a result it worked for the most part.Oh before I forget, Rest in peace Bob Clark.He died at 67 in a head on which also killed his son last week.This version directed by Glen Morgan brings gore and eye balls popping out every chance he gets.Hey there's even a scene where an icicle falls off the roof and pierces through Andrea Martin head.Its laughable! She would of had a better death if she let the killer did it.The acting is so-so but nothing worth noting.They're spoiled girls and very vulgar when they speak.You'll probably do what I did after a while and root for the killer."
1,keep away,I was looking at this mostly because I've enjoyed the actresses in this film's previous work. But this movie never game them a chance to act. I was lost through most of the movie as to why things were just now happening. The only noteworthy feature is that it has a True HD audio track.
5,I watch it again and again,A great Christmas gift if you are a horror fan like me. Nicely done visually and very entertaining. I really like all the actresses which posess great talent and sophistication.
2,Stick to the original,"I agree with the sentiment of most reviewers on here. The plot to this movie was simply absurd and while the director did not set out to make a slasher movie, this is simply all he made. For one, you never really care about the sorority members and what happens to them in this movie. Rather than getting backstory on the sorority members to actually care about them, you have a lot of Billy backstory and simply a bunch of foulmouthed sorority sisters that you don't care about.Further, the movie is filled with Billy backstory that simply takes away from what made the original so great. Who was Billy...why did he do what he did? But you can figure out what's going on here from early on, so there's really no great surprise. There are also a bunch of plot holes and killers doing things that are physically impossible. And how many times are two people both erroneously pronounced dead?"
1,I would have given it zero stars....,"I would have given this movie zero stars but you have to rate it. This remake is an absolute insult to a classic horror film. Come to think of it, it's and insult to horror movies. Where to start....I wont. I wont waste your time like this movie wasted mine.To sum it up, I'd rather sit through a 24 hour marathon of Richard Gere romance movies than spend 30 seconds watching any of this junk."
2,Sigh...,"The original Black Christmas is one of my all-time favorite movies. The boogieman in the attic remained a fear of mine throughout the 70's after watching this show way too young. Sadly, and perhaps predictably, the remake is just a bunch of overblown violence, really terrible acting, and gore that is just too dumb to be scary.I wish movie makers would get back to psychological, suspenseful thrillers and move away from this trend of mindless blood and guts crap. Today's ""scary"" movies give too much away. It's not about continuous slashing and screaming, it's about the creepy music and shadows slithering up behind you.Black Christmas 2006 is perfect for the lazy viewer who can't be bothered with a good storyline or edge-of-the-seat suspense. For that reason, I'm rating it two stars. If you're more mature than that, however, stick with the original. You'll probably hate this remake."
1,one of the worst,"Long a devotee of giallo, horror, hell ALL genres of movies, I looked forward to Morgan and Wong's latest. They did some nifty things with the X-Files and Millennium and other things. However....this has NOTHING to offer. No characterization, no colorful set-pieces. Nothing. A waste of time, by and large. It stinks on ice as Mel Brooks once said."
1,Doesn't work,"I have a hd 3d tv and blue ray player and it won't play... Glad it was only $6.00 but it's pretty lame I buy it brand new, open it pop it in and it does nothing but say loading."
1,Who came up with this crap!!!!,"Stupid, stupid, stupid! The worst pile of garbage I have ever seen!!! This movie is ridiculously and needlessly gruesome. Has very little to do with the original. Not that the original was even good, but it was bearable compared to this nonsense."
4,Perfect Reaction,"I got this movie for my husband for Christmas...he had been wanting to see it and I am NOT a fan of these kinds of movies, but he wanted it so I got it for him. It was the perfect reaction because he never would have thought I would buy it. I did watch it with him, and while I didnt care for it, he LOVED it...but this is no surprise! It is exactly what it says it is..."
1,Better leave this Christmas unopened,How could they take such a great concept and just run it into the ground! Not one thing about this movie is worth your time.
1,Way too boring,This over hyped movie was so disappointing that I gave it away to someone I didn't like.
3,NOT SO HOLLY JOLLY,"This remake of the 1974 cult classic is probably unnecessary, but as slasher films go, it's not that bad.A group of sorority sisters find themselves stalked by a crazed killer who just escaped from a mental institution. The girls are pretty generic and it's hard to keep up with who's who but director Glen Morgan (FINAL DESTINATION) keeps the mood spooky and there are some twists. The DVD also offers three alternate endings, none any better than the one selected. It's not a great film but horror fans should be satisfied."
3,ok for me,Alot of pretty faces but i wish there was more...I liked the movie but the killings felt too quick like everything was going by fast and it felt like something was missing can't really but my finger on what was missing. But other than that good killings ok movie ...would wait for the DVD tho or borrow a copy but you can spend your money to watch it in threaters...
1,HORRIBLE remake!!,Do NOT waste your time on this sludge! I won't even waste much of my time reviewing the movie. Ridiculous! One star is being generous.
4,Stylish and Twisted Slasher,"I wasn't paying close enough attention when I purchased this movie, I thought I was ordering the original 74 Black Christmas,(I didn't even know this remake existed} and was initially really disappointed when I went to watch it and realized I had the wrong film, but my disappointment was short lived, first off this is a really good looking film, bright, colorful, and stylish. The story is really twisted and the kills and special effects are top notch, any slasher fan will really dig this flick, really high body count and the action is unrelenting from start to finish. This is an 80's style slasher with the best elements of modern pacing, special effects and film techniques. The gore and kills are pretty over the top, and this film will disgust and sicken the average viewer, but for any hard core slasher fan, this is a must see."
1,We live in revisionist times..,"This is, despite what some think, simply a revisionist version of the original and better 1974 release. More gore to keep the video game generation in their seats....but no more substance than the original. The 1974 release was an innovation in the genre, this is just another slasher movie.Simply one more in a long line of questionable remakes....fortunately not as bad as the Wicker Man remake, but certainly no prize winner."
5,A Great Gorefest For All Horror Fans,"Blood, Guts, Sex And An Insane Psychopathic Killer..What More Could You Ask For? This Movie Was Great. The Original Was Better But This One Is Definitely Worth The Money To Buy And Or Rent As Well...As Big Fan Of Slasher Flicks I Wish I Could Give This One AT Least A Nine But We Only Get 5..So..Yeah..If Your The Type That Likes A Good Slasher In The Spirit Of Freddy And Jason And Chucky And All Of The Above Masters Than This Is IT!"
1,Worst Packaging ever seen.,"The worst packaging of a ""sensitive, fragile"" instrument I have ever seen. There were holes in the inside item boxes where the Scope had rubbed and worn thru the cardboard! No foam or cardboard baffles in any of the boxes, to sabalize movement. The Scope was in a plastic bag, loose, rattling around in its box. The counterweight punched thru its box and the outer box.This is a fathers day present, won't know if it even works until the gift is given this weekend....Was this a returned used item??? ...Is this how the manufacturer treats there products???(I bought a Meade scope couple years ago, came packed safely and securely).I hope this thing works!!!!!, I hope its not damaged!!!!BTW, this is a Target Store item purchase from the Amazon website. This is Targets fault."
3,"Good, But Nothing like Seasons 2-5","What irks me about this release is that I know that the marketing suits at the distribution company will decide whether or not to release future seasons of this classic show based on the sales of THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON....And just about every Melrose Place fan knows that ""The first season is the WORST season,"" and is unlike the rest of the series. I think they should have released the SECOND SEASON first, and would have had much stronger sales. I LOVE MELROSE PLACE, except for this season. That being said, I purchased it anyway, for the Last 12 or so episodes of the FIRST SEASON, which include Amanda, and which are more dramatic than the original premise of the show....The show didn't really take off until Season 2, in any case."
1,BRING ON SEASON TWO!,"i agree, season one sucks, i really want season two to come out and i hope they don't base it on sales because season one truly is the worst, season 2 and three of melrose are the best, let's just hope they come out before 2008!"
1,Melrose Place,"Don't fall for this scam and expect to be able to reach the end result which is season 7. Won't happen. They get you involved in the storyline, then after you have WASTED your money, that's it! Stuck with no more episodes to finish the series off. Thanks alot............"
5,AGE IS NOTHING BUT A NUMBER!,"This is a really good show. Why? Well its camp, in the beginning this show TRIED to take it serious, it did not work, it needed trash, scandal, sex, deception, murder, sex, lies, sex, more sex. What Dynasty was for the 80's, Melrose was for the 90's! Pure Adulterated Fun, Eventually you can tell everyone is in on the joke ""pretending to be a VERY Serious show WITH Serious issues"". What I like about this show is that they are twentysomethings , thirtysomethings and IT WORKED no excuses no apologies, it could be done because your old enough to do so."
5,Love this DVD!,Being a huge Melrose freak I couldn't wait to get the dvd's for the extras! The only problem is they don't play through.
4,Must See TV,"I couldn't appreciate this show when it premiered in the 90's because I was just a little kid. It's a really good show, though and season one is my favorite.Alison is a bit annoying...she tells Billy that he cant date Amanda because she's her boss and she wants to keep her home and work life separate, but why did she agree to go with Amanda to her dad's lake house?I really like the storyline/relationship of Rhonda Blair and Terrence. I like how they met and how he was rich, but she didn't know at first. Just when that started to get good, they take the Rhonda character away! Interestingly enough, ""Rhonda"" and ""Terrence"" married each other in real life in 2007...wow.This show makes for great nostalgia...hair scrunchies, answering machines, LA Riot, AIDS (not that that doesn't still exist..)I don't like how with the DVD itself, there's no ""play all"" on the menu."
4,A dated work about an admirable man,"When I was growing up in Iowa, the sports personality most of us worshipped was Bart Starr; he always seemed to be above criticism. A neighborhood get together to play football always led to disputes as to who was to be ""Bart"", a.k.a. the quarterback. It was a fun time; sports figures were people we admired for what they did on the field.From this book, it is clear that Starr should also have been admired for what he was off the field. Unlike so many other sports personalities that engaged in poor behavior when not in their sports uniform, Starr was a poster boy for the good. Although modern children will not know who Bart Starr is, this is still a good book about a sports hero that is truly deserving of the title."
2,"Spectacular singing, horrible production","First let me say that this is one of my ""desert island"" performances. I love this music and specifically Madeleine Grey's singing of it. There is no finer performance of these songs that I have come across - many that I enjoy such as Devrath, Te Kanawa, etc - but none that really come even close to this one. It's heavenly, I am always transported to the Auvergne when I listen to it. Incidentally Grey premiered the work with Canteloube. At least one expert says her Auvergnat pronunciation is very authentic.I have the 1950's mono reissue of this and I can tell you that sound-wise it is not great. That said, this transcription of the music makes it much much worse. Sounds like they played the original 78 on someone's pack-and-play and recorded off the speaker. Let's hope EMI decides to try again, this time making a real effort. As much as I love this performance I would have to say avoid this particular recording."
3,decent value chair,"I bought this chair based upon a few other reviews here. The chair is constructed of solid materials and seems to be a decent value. For some reason, the back cushion is much denser than the seat cushion, and we have had to add another seat pillow to sit on because the provided seat cushion is not sufficient. The adjustment mechanisms both work fine, and overall, we are glad we bought this. But beware - you WILL need more seat cushion to sit on..."
3,"Looks nice, well built, not so comfy","The chair was easy to assemble and looks nice, but the bottom cushion is not nearly as comfortable as I anticipated. The padding is not real thick and seems to be only a medium density foam. The padding is somewhat thicker at the front and sides and, oddly thin in the middle where most of the weight comes down. I will probably be investing in a foam pad. I would not invest in another even though otherwise it well built."
4,Comfortable Chair,"I bought this chair after reading the reviews here. I wanted a back-friendly chair with armrests so I won't feel uncomfortable using my computer for a long time. The chair is doing a great job so far - no back pain and arms rested and comfortable. The chair arrived on time and it was rather easy to assemble -- it took me about twenty minutes. However, I am forced give this a 4-star rating because when the chair arrived, it had a small crack in the cup-like thing that is inserted all the way in the bottom, in the centre of the five legs. That said, it was nothing a little putty could not fix."
3,Not quite up to snuff,"There was a lot going for this product. Long illumination life with space for 9(!) batteries, a tripod, sleek design and a very interesting reflector configuration (you can put your fingertip directly over the LED element and the light beam seems completely unaffected) should have made this product a 5 star winner. I understand that earlier models of these flashlights had multiple LED's. Therein lies the rub. The model I own has only one. Contrary to the assessment of other reviewers, I find that the single LED actually throws light a long way. The problem is that the light beam is WAY too tight. The tripod implies hands free work use, but the beam is too narrow for the area effect that would fulfill my expectations adequately. (I modified mine with a home made diffuser, which helped.) Having said all that, if you just need a hands-free way to change a flat tire in the dark (as illustrated on the packaging) it will do the job."
2,"Cheap ""quality""--avoid this.","My wife bought this for me a couple of years ago and it worked fine for a while. LED's were bright and the idea is very useful. But, the screw caps on each foot are low quality and first one, and then another, failed and the batteries fall out. I tried using duct tape to keep them on, but the spring inside and the weight of the batteries quickly causes the tape to fail. I avoid Stanley products because each one I've bought in the past 15 years has been lower and lower quality. I'm ready for the Joby light with legs and magnets too."
3,For General Household Use,"Please refer to the image I uploaded to give a clear idea on how powerful (or not) its light output is whether it will suit one's preference. In my opinion, I find it quite useful for all my chores around the house and some occasional stroll in the park at night time. This is more like a spot flashlight instead of a flood-type. I've had pretty good experience with its battery consumption; those 9 AA batteries that were still with this unit is now on its 14th month and it's still doing good. Of course, since I mentioned household use, we only use it sparingly.It's obvious there are better units in the market than this one, but for its decent price and performing according to its intended use, this would be fine for most people."
5,tripod flashlight,"Very handy especially when working by yourself. GReat lighting. Good to keep in car for emergencies, camping, and or regular use. It would be good to have at least 2, one for the car and for the house."
2,"will last a lifetime, if you don't live too long....","I liked the idea of the tripod base and that works well. It has 3 light levels,none very bright. Uses 9 aa batteries! and weather resistant means you should resist taking it out in the weather or you might find out Stanley's ""Lifetime"" warranty is ONE YEAR! yipes! glad I didn't have to die to find that out."
2,O K,I probably would not purchase this item again. It was for a Christmas gift. Therefore I'm not certain how it really works for the person receiving the gift.
2,not that bright unless on highest setting,for the money..not worth the price. I felt it was too dim on all but the highest setting.. For half the price I get more light/use out of my head lamp...and uses less batteries and takes up a ton less space. I was very disappointed in the light output...
1,Pretty cheaply made,"I had this flashlight perhaps 10 seconds before it was broken. I put the batteries in and noticed that even with all three bulbs illuminated that it wasn't that bright. Then I thought I see how the legs opened up. Pulled one out and then obviously overextended it and it broke off. Now, like I said, I accidentally overextended the leg but it took virtually no effort to do so. I think if you're very careful with the legs it might be fairly useful but it's so delicate that it would never hold long not matter what."
4,Solid,"I bought this flashlight as a gift and when my brother in law saw it he wanted one too, so I wound up buying a 2nd. Both recipients praised how solid Stanley products are. They both appreciated hands free illumination of a job. The only draw back of course, is when working in a very tight space your body blocks the light.I would recommend this product."
2,Poor excuse for a worklight,"I fell for this because I own several other LED flashlights, and under counter lights. It cost far more than cheaper (and much brighter) lights that unfortunately do not have a tripod attached to them. I have no idea where they got their bulb/lens design, but it was the biggest waste of 30 dollars that I have endured in a long time. Thanks for NOTHING Stanley."
3,Average at best..,"First of all, this flashlight isn't very bright. I have a cheap 1AA flashlight that is way brighter than this. The tripod is useful to aim the light where you need it. This is an ok light to have around the house, but it would not be good for serious everyday use."
3,"OK, I wish they'd spread the light more","This is a perfectly useful product and the tripod legs make it a nice work light for plumbing and other tight spots. My only criticism is the tightly focused beam. It seems that they took a regular flashlight head and gave it tripod legs to give it two functions. I already have many dedicated flashlights and really wanted a work light with a wider beam spread so the light isn't so concentrated to a tight spot. The light beam also has an odd color band around the outside, it fades to yellow.It's OK, but could be better if they'd designed this more as a work light and not just a narrow beam flashlight with legs. A flip-down diffuser lens would be a nice update.Update 9/11:I've downgraded this to three stars. After having used this several times, the odd colored beam has made this a very annoying work light. The spot beam is so yellow that it's distracting. I'd only recommend this if you get it cheap..."
3,a good start!,"Silly me! I just assumed that this little tripod was a telescoping one, like the mini tripods for cameras. That way the flashlight could be adjustable to perhaps two or three feet tall instead of eight or ten inches. Good basic idea but Stanley could do much better. And, as another reviewer said, the lumens could be much brighter. Hope the company is listening because I think I'm going to return the one I just bought. If a tripod can be adapted to fit a camera it certainly can be done for a flashlight."
2,CHECK YOUR BATTERIES REGULARLY,I found only one other person who mentioned this problem in these reviews but I feel it warrants mentioning again. It seems this unit drains the very bottom batteries disproportionately fast but as I found out the unit will still operate. Actually the unit will operate with only three batteries in one of the legs. Strangely with apparently the same brightness level as with all nine batteries. Then what happens is the bottom battery that drains first will leak corroding and destroying the tube inside the leg. Upon checking the batteries in this unit I found all three of the nine batteries that sit in the bottom of the leg tubes completely dead and the rest still good. Sadly the battery that had been dead the longest leaked destroying the inside of the tube.It was then I realized 3 batteries in one tube will operate the unit
3,Useful tool,Not as sturdy as I thought it would be but is very functional. A useful tool to have in the tool box.
1,Didn't receive what I ordered,"I searched the internet to replace a GREAT flashlight which got lost and found it here, as pictured. BUT they substitued a different light, cheaply made with plastic legs, one won't even stay in. The one pictured has 3 light settiings, this one has only on and off. Not worth returning but I am extremely disappointed."
4,nice flashlight,"my boyfriend got this product as a present, and it has been a good present. It takes UP TO nine batteries, but can function with as little as three. When he first got it, we put in the full nine, and he used it a lot. When the batteries got weak, and we replaced them. Out of curiosity, we put in only three (in one leg) and the light was as bright as with nine. Now i'm assuming it's going to burn out quicker, and we'll have to add three new batteries pretty quick, but such is life.Overall, it seems to me to be a good flashlight, even with only three AA betteries. i would recommend this."
2,"Good concept, poor execution","The tripod design is a great idea. The frame is also well constructed, and has quality feel.However, they must have sourced some lousy/cheap LED. The brightness pales in comparison to a LED flashlight that operates on 2 AA batteries, and this is in the brightest setting with all 6 LEDs on and brand new batteries.Also, I couldn't find the lumens rating, either on Amazon or the box. Probably for a reason."
2,Newer version is better and cheaper,"The original Stanley Tripod Flashlight (model 95-112) has six weak LEDs. In 2008, the model was replaced with one having a single bright LED and the same model number. The new one lists at only $10 and sells for less. I compared them against each other. The construction is similar but the light from the new one is much more intense and useful. I don't know why they kept the same model number but the six LED one is on clearance at most stores. Look for the one LED - it is marked on the box. And shop around - you'll be surprised."
2,Not Up To Stanley's Standards,"This is NO $30 flashlight. Cheap on/off switch either doesn't change the brightness or turns it off when you want it brighter. AA batteries are stored in the legs with very flimsy screw feet to hold them in. If you twisted too hard it would probably strip the plastic threads. Adjustable aiming beam has light detent stops.Overall, I would not buy this item again. It says ""heavy-duty"" but I don't give it a year. Definitely not a professional grade tool."
3,Needs More Brightness,"I thought that the idea for a hands-free flashlight was very innovative, especially if someone is working beneath a car, under the sink, on a wall surface, etc.As other reviews have said, though, this light doesn't cut it when it comes to brightness, even with all bulbs illuminated and all batteries in place.Might be a good idea to wait for Stanley to iron out the kinks on this model and pick up the next generation of the MaxLife."
1,Idea is good construction pathetic,"I received this for Father's Day and was very excited because I could see where the tripod would come in very handy. Unfortunately the construction is incredibly shoddy. After only a week the catch to hold the legs in is non-existent so the legs just flop open if you don't hold them closed. One of the legs won't stay in so I have to keep pushing it in. It wasn't dropped or mistreated, it's just crappy."
1,Battery expense,This flashlight is a good concept; with the tripod legs to hold it upHowever the product requires the use of NINE batteries.The illumination is not worth the added price of the 9 batteries for 3 hours if you are lucky
4,"Excellent design and nicest LED color temp I've seen - should be all metal, though","This is a very nice piece of equipment for the do-it-yourselfer or camper. The batteries in the tripod legs are a brilliant piece of design, and the overall functionality of the moving head is very nice. What really sets this light apart from other, cheaper LED lights is the quality of the lens, which focuses all 9 LEDs into a single circle of light; this beam is the closest I've seen to a traditional flashlight beam a-la MagLight, and has very little of the annoying LED blue-ness to it. Note that you can't change the focus on this light, but that's alright, as the beam they've engineered is a good all-around one.Long-term durability is my only concern, as this light has a plastic head and hinge parts for the tripod legs. If this were available in an all-metal design, it would be a hands-down 5-star item."
2,Floppy head,"I got this for my husband who works in tight spaces. The mobile head is too mobile. With the flick of a finger it flips over when he is using it as a standard flashlight. Great concept, but I should have waited for the next generation."
1,Not a good product,Very poor quality. Would not work out of the box.Pretty well embarassed I even bought it.Very surprised from Shanley to put this on the market.Would not buy or even look at again.
2,Bad color,"I had high hopes for this light, but I *hate* the color that the single LED produces. It is sort of faintly yellowish with deep blue in the center. Not much light for 3 AA's either.Blah, back it goes."
1,Dismal Results,"i have 2 of these tripod flashlights, this modelthey BOTH have battery ""legs"" that doesnt work anymorethe brightness is too low, i get better results from my 2x AAA maglightthe color of the LED's are NOT the sameall and all this product has been a dismal waste of money, and yes, i have 2 because i bought them at the same time."
3,"very cool, lots of batteries...","I bought this as a gift for my dad. He really seemed pleased with it since he is always asking someone to hold the flashlight for him. It might not be useful for all situations, but we'll see... Also, it does require a ton of AA batteries... I think he said 12 or 16 of them!"
2,Not worthless - but not great,"I wouldn't go so far as to call it worthless, but I don't recommend it. It is very prone to accidental activation. I had to tape a plastic cover over the on/off switch to keep it from turning itself on while rolling around in my car's trunk. The head doesn't stay in the position I set it. It uses way too many batteries for the amount of light it throws.Instead of getting this tripod light, buy a Petzl headlamp. Here's why - I had to change a flat tire in a dark parking lot. My body was always between the wheel and the tripod light. I ended up holding a pocket flashlight between my teeth, so I could see what i was doing. If I'd had a headlamp, it would have been a breeze, instead of an ordeal."
4,Good,"This product is affordable, very bright and does not weigh very much. The stand is perfect and works very well for a one man job!!!!"
1,Poor plastic,Great concept - however after about two uses the plastic cap on one of the legs broke and the batteries drop out.
2,Warning: The product has been changed,"I just bought one of these lights and this is not what I was led to believe I was ordering. I had bought one about a year ago and it has 6 LEDs with three brightness settings. That is also how it is described in other reviews and what is shown in the picture. I find the brightness settings very useful, so I wanted to get another one. But when I received the one I ordered last week it has a single LED, not six, and no brightness settings. The light from this LED is not the nice white color of the older one, but a sickly green halo with a white spot in the center. Although I liked the original, I don't like this and would not have bought it."
1,Save your money,I purchased this product as a christmas gift so I went to put batteries in it before I wrapped it. The tripod legs will not stay together at all. I am sending it back.
3,Good idea.,"This is a good flashlight to keep in the trunk of your auto, or in your garage. It presents a hands-free opportunity so that you can do the job without someone to hold the flashlight. Great emergency flashlight for lighting up the fusebox or turning off the gas line during emergencies. The only drawback is that it is alittle pricey."
1,"Good idea, but cheaply made","I had been looking for a flashlight that could stand on a tripod and I thought this product would be the answer. However, when i tried turning on the flashlight, it did not work. After shaking the light came on, but flickered. I opened it up to find that the soldering is faulty."
5,Great book,Great book I love Hannah Howell and the Murray series is Great! Whenever I read her books I cannot put them down and she did not fail this time either.
2,Review of the e-book,"I'm not writing this to discuss the plot. Instead, my review is of the quality of this particular ebook. I have never seen so many typos in a kindle book. It is very very distracting, especially when the main character's name is misspelled several times. Honestly, I suggest buying the paperback. Shame on the editor."
2,Not the Payton I was looking for.,"I have so many of Hannah Howell's Highland series and absolutely adore them, but this particular book just didn't do it for me. Payton seemed to have lost his charm somewhere between Highland Vow(Elspeth and Cormac) to his own tale, and Kirstie really didn't wow me either. I liked Callum better than the main characters and found myself looking forward to his development more than to the shallow sex driven character that was Payton."
1,A Disappointing New Book from Hannah Howell,"I am usually a fan of Hannah Howell, but her newest book ""Highland Angel"" was a great disappointment. A major plot point concerns sexual abuse of children and that immediately concerned me. I found it so distasteful,I really couldn't enjoy the book in any way. The next time she has a new book, I will be wary of just buying it without checking out the contents."
3,Powerful Fan,"I installed the fan but couldn't just let it work with the default full speed mode, the fan is really really noisy, I had to switch to autoregulated by temperature mode."
4,Excellent fan,"Thermaltake A2029 120mm Smart Case Fan IIDistinctive fan For a control system at speeds of turnover , Quiet cooling fan when adjusted to low or middle speed ."
4,Dark Tapestry,"This is a crime thriller set in the orthodox Jewish community of North West London, yet is not exclusive to a Jewish audience. Not usually a fan of ""Jewish fiction"", I found Dark Tapestry to be fastpaced, interesting, entertaining, well written and hard to put down. I was particularly drawn to the main character Colin Sommers, a likeable detective, on his rediscovery of his orthodox Jewish roots. I look forward to the next book in the ""Colin and Leora Mysteries"" series."
5,"New, but suppressed knowledge","I've heard of Orgone energy, and the work of Reich and Dr. James DeMeo. This book explains orgone energy, and its beneficial uses. The book has instructions for orgone devices, but I've not experimented with them. There are many web sites based on Reich's work, that offer for sale ""orgone healing devices', ""Holy Hand Grenades"", ""Cloud Busters"". etc. In my opinion, these are just scams to get your money."
1,KEEP AWAY FROM THIS MICROSCOPE!,"Whatever you do, do not buy this microscope! The LED light is too bright and you are unable to adjust it. It is near impossible to see anything through the eye piece and the view screen on the front is a joke. You can barely get anything in focus because as soon as you let go off the focus knob everything goes out of focus.This toy is made entirely of cheap plastic and it just about the worst microscope I've ever used. Spare yourself the aggrivation and don't order this!"
2,Beware,"The picture is misleading - the candle set does not come with the candle stands. What's the use without the candle stands? Also, mine was received poorly packaged and the candles were strewn about - fortunately not broken but I'm surprised they weren't given how they were packaged. Finally, the bow was torn off mine, probably due to the poor shipping. Overall, I'm not happy with the product. So BEWARE."
1,Zero stars if it were possible,Bought one at Best Buy despite negative reviews at the website. It wouldn't even successfully load into the camera. Never got to find out if it even worked.
4,A wonderful new serie to read on Ghost PI Jack and Bookstore owner Pen,This series is by the same author of the Coffeehouse Mysteries Cleo Coyle. This is a very enjoyable read. It is about a women who co-owns a bookstore with her Aunt that has a ghost in it who was a private eye back in the 40's and was killed and can not leave the bookstore. There is a murder and he helps her solve the case. Pen and jack make a good team and you want your own ghost. It makes you want to read the whole series.
4,Good Start,"I picked up this book after hearing great things about the series. While I thought the story was somewhat predictable, I thought it was a great storyline and a great introduction to the series' characters. I'm looking forward to reading the next in the series!"
1,disappointing!,"I am obviously not in the majority here as I thought this book pretty bad. I enjoy cozy mysteries but they still have to be well written and hopefully imaginative. This ghost sleuth was ridiculously generic. Anytime I thought ""oh, yeh, ok, this is cute"" it soon wasn't. Won't read any more."
1,waste of paper,"I had read other reviews of this and was looking forward to reading it. Unfortunately, this book did not live up to expectations. The characters were not very likable. The voice of the Ghost in the title, a film noir rendition of a 40's hard-boiled PI, was overdone and did not ring true. Much of the pulp fiction of that era was better written. Here's a note for all authors: read your work aloud and if the dialog sounds stilted and unnatural to you, then it will to your readers as well.I had to give up half way through this book, as the plot was very slowly paced, the characters seemed one dimensional and not very likable, the murderer was obvious, and the way the victim was drawn, there should have been at least a dozen people who would have been viable suspects without involving the heroine."
1,A book for old women with cats,"Clever idea that falls flat on it's face.Sickly sweet, no character development, and solutions tied up with a neat lace bow.Disappointing - the idea of a ghost as a partner in crime solving and sleuthing has such potential."
4,"Good, clean, ghostly fun!","I really liked this book, not because it was the best mystery I have ever read, or it was the most exciting book in the world. I liked this book because it was just plain fun. It didn't require alot of thought, it is short and to the point. It is filled with humour, action, suspense and it does all this without vulgar language, guts all over the floor, and everyone sleeping with everyone else. This book could be read by young and old alike and everyone in between.The plot is good, the idea is fresh and different from the usual mystery novel. The mental conversations between the main character and the ghost are great. I can't wait for the next installment of this series to see how the relationship between these two blossoms. Share this book with a friend or relative. The townsfolk remind me of a small mid-western town I grew up in where everyone knows everyone else's business and everyone has an opinion. This is a refreshing book, I hope you enjoy it."
3,Minus 2,"I had to take off two points for these reaons:1. As many have mentioned, Jack's vocabulary. I LONGED for him to say ""woman"" just one time instead of dame, doll. etc.2. I read and re-read the section at the end of one chapter where the speaker dies and the beginning of the next where we find out the heroine has gotten drunk and passed out. There is no transition. There is no explanation. Suddenly she's blotto. I'd at least liked for her to find a bottle of whiskey and taken a drink.I did not remove points for the authors' lecture on where we should buy our books or the explanation of what a book expo is--although I considered that. Those were condescending.Other than that, I would have given this book a good, solid FOUR. Not quite good enough for a FIVe but still enjoyable."
5,Delightful Read,"I absolutely loved this book! I read this with an ""online"" friend and she and I enjoyed chatting about it. We both decided we wanted to own bookshops...lol. So much of this book reminded me of the old 1940's B&W movies. In particular, The Ghost & Mrs. Muir & The Big Sleep. My husband and I are big fans of 1940's B&W movies and the author of this book undoubtedly is as well! If you enjoy cozy, intelligent mysteries, then you will enjoy this one! Looking forward to Alice Kimerberly's next book in this series."
4,"Fun, Cute and Clever","A delightful read to entertain the reader for an evening. The ""ghost"" is reminiscent of the black and white movie, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir with enough 1940's jargon to bring you back to the Howard Duff or Humphrey Bogart films of tough-talking, rough-action, heart-of-gold private detectives of the same era.The book moves along quite nicely, never leaving you hanging with unanswered details and not over-crowded with too many characters. Instead, it is an easy transition into the genre and a pleasant experience of dialogue and description.I would highly recommend this book for someone who has a few spare hours to just be totally entertained, not looking for an advance of great knowledge and wanting to relax with a little comedy. A delightful read to say the least."
4,Great read,"This was my first time reading Alice Kimberly and I thought the book was great! I am always happy to discover new authors. I really enjoyed the ghost of Jack Shepard; his old-time mystery lingo really added to the story - it was something different from the usual mysteries I read. The characters were not as well developed as I normally like, and the plot was not a brain-buster. This is a great ""dessert"" or easy beach read. I have already downloaded the next book in the series and plan to read them all."
4,Nice,"I'll admit, this book took FOREVER to get to the point. There is way too much lull and background story, and not enough action. HOWEVER, in spite of itself I still like this book. The growing relationship between Jack and Pen was nice to read, and it'll be interesting to see the pieces of Jack's life come to light through subsequent books. I can't wait to read the next one!"
3,Cute! About three and a half stars,"It was a cute mystery. Although, I had the culprit pegged from very near the beginning, it was still an entertaining read in a light fluffy way. I just couldn't really feel much depth to the characters. There was a lot said about their past and feelings, but it didn't follow through to create a real sense of the character. The interaction between Mrs. McClure and the ghost were amusing, but I think more depth to the ghost would have gone a long way to giving more depth to the entire book. The supporting characters seemed more like set pieces than characters."
3,Too basic,"No decent EAI examples. Good for managers looking at using J2ee to integrate systems, offers ideas to some TA's, but little help to the seasoned developer. We already know what an EJB is..."
2,J2ee EAI,"After reading this book I found it to be minimally useful as far as detailed examples are concerned. However, the author covered many various options and technologies used in enterprise application integration. Some of the approaches included were JCA, Web Services, and JMS, but as I said before, lacked in examples.The book however, does provide good references to resources that I found useful for accomplishing the task of EAI. The author even covers some Open Source projects that proved to be interesting.I would only recommend this book to those just beginning EAI and have a firm grasp on the Java language. The book is fairly suitable for reference if you a looking for different approaches to a solution but do not need any detail examples."
5,Simple-easy to read.,"Simple easy-to-read literature on the dynamics of the work place. I bought this book for a course on organizational development/leadership and I used it for so many other courses in my education master's program. I truly recommend it, especially for those interested in leadership positions."
2,Are they really metaphors,"I was recommended this book by a well known consultant who uses NLP in his work. The book starts off by defining metaphors and how by using metaphors to describe a situation we can focus on how we look at an issue but by so doing ignore other aspects that are not in the metaphor.My disappointment with the book is that of the six viewpoints that he expresses I am not convinced that any of them are now metaphors that people who work and manage organizations actually use to me they are just a convenient way to categorize management theory.Ch 2 Organizations as MachinesCH 3: Organizations as OrganismsCH 4: Organizations as BrainsCH 5: Organizations as CulturesCH 6: Organizations as Political SystemsCH 7: Organizations as Psychic PrisonsThe book is also dated - he talks a lot about the success of the Japanese model, and its inroads to the US in the 90's but who talks about the Japanese model today.An expensive book and a disappointment."
3,Not his best work.,"This was ok, but not his best work. We loved seeing Ken live, we own several of his DVD's but don't much care for this one."
4,Family comedy,"Once again good, family comedy from Ken Davis and Bob Stromberg. A dvd you can share with friends."
5,One of the Best Records in History,"The clouds parted and a choir of angels sang. A beam of light shone down on England, and the Polecats were created. This godlike band is the platonic ideal of musical perfection.The Polecats have been my favorite rock group for 19 years. This is their best record since ""Polecats Are Go,"" which was never released on CD. This is one of the best records I have ever heard. It is a huge error that this group hasn't received the recognition they deserve. The guitar, vocals, rythmn, and production on this album are flawless. If radio stations weren't so format-oriented every other song on this album would be a hit.It's true that the Polecats tend toword upbeat, fast songs. If you want gloomy, non-melodic complaint-rock, you might want to look elsewhere. But if you're that depressed, this record might be just the thing for you.The Polecat's whole approach to music is so wonderful I only wish everyone played like this."
2,Some helpful info - but largely dated,"This video is probably about 10 years old. It does offer some information about the Cayman Islands which would be valuable for those planning trips - but most of it is too dated to be of value (i.e., the Holiday Inn it shows is now gone). It also seems from time to time to be a ""swimsuit"" review - with lots of shots of girls in bikinis."
4,pretty good....,this guide is good but is really short on the worlds themselves.its very helpful when they tell you what cards you should use for bosses.i could'nt beat them without it!!i wish they tell you more on how to beat riku #4...he's REALLY tough!!!!(they warn you about that too...)get this guide it's good!!!~starfishie~
1,Ribbon was too old,"The object of ordering was to have a ribbon that could be used in a typewriter.The cartridges looked good but when installed were so old and dried out thatthey would not imprint the typing paper. If someone knows of another placethat I can order from that has ribbon to fit this typewriter, I would be indebtedto you. Not finding a source has held up a major project."
1,"Um, what's the brightness?","I see brightness ratings of 108, 113, and 92, all on the same page. Clearly a company with a penchant for detail!"
1,Yall suck,"I still have not received my order? You guys did not apply my gift certificate, so I have paid $80 for computer paper I never even got. I want my credit back on my credit card, and I will throw the $50 gift certificate away, and just count it as a loss. It is not worth all this trouble to do business with a company. Also I do not even have a phone # to call to straighten this out. I will never do business with Amazon again."
2,Stalk your prey...,"The main point I took away from this book, was the guerrilla tactic of stalking a pharm. rep, and begging for their help, while they are on the job! Most of the things she recommends could be applied in any industry. Her advice is very generic, and her resume help was laughable. I can't believe how much I paid for this book, a book that is akin to a kindergarten workbook in content and style."
2,Sturdy but sand pail sized,"This seems like a sturdy little shovel. However, it not much bigger than a little scoop that a five year old kid would use to play in the sand. For $30, I was expecting something a little bigger. I understand that it is designed to save space, but kid-sized is too small for the price. If it were cheaper, I would give it more stars."
4,Shapeworks Quickstart,"Although I ordered the Wild Berry flavor, my review is of the choclate flavor, as the company was out of berry. I find that the drink is very delicious and fills you up. There is plenty of product for the price and would recommend the product to all. Since I've been using the product I have dropped 4 pounds."
1,Made me woozy!,I took this product for about 2-3 days. Made me light headed. The tea did give me a boost of energy and the shake isn't half bad.
3,Good but...,This is a great collection but think twice about the purchase as the collection is missing one of the defining T. Rex tracks Bang a Gong (Get It On)
4,Quality head for its modest size,"The head easily supports my 5D camera, 70-200ms lens, and flash without sagging and I don't need to tighten down the head lock all the way (as other reviews mention) to keep my camera from moving it. That makes the ball head still easy to loosen when I need to reposition the camera. I tighten the ball lock to keep the camera fixed but keep the swivel lock only partially tightened, allowing the whole ball head to rotate 360 degrees around the center axis, which is useful for panorama shots or tracking a moving subject (like a sports car).The only difficulty I can foresee is using this with gloves, as turning the dial locks could be harder than a flintlock system (like tripods)."
1,Not for my Canon 7D,With my 7D if I try to shoot vertical the ball just slowly lets the camera sink.
1,Tanked top,"Thought I was ordering a pack of 2, apparently not. Only one came, so disappointedWon't make that mistake again"
1,THE SHIRT WAS TINY!,I ORDERED A SIZE 2XL TO GIVE AS A GIFT......WHEN WE GOT THE SHIRT IT WAS TINY!!! IT LOOKED LIKE A SIZE SMALL.....I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN!!!!
5,A must buy if you want to understand what you are doing...,"I have had this little book for a few years, in addition to my collection of other fly pattern and aquatic insect books -- if you only need one book this it. I keep going back to the Hatch Guide for Western Streams since it is clear, concise, yet has plenty of useful information. Not only on which bugs to look for, and how to tie them, but also on where in the water to find them and the types of water they like. Reading, or comfortably skimming through this book will definetly help your trout fishing. I like it so much I am looking to buy a second copy, hopefully a waterproof paper version that I believe is still in print? This is a GREAT little book with accurate information and good tips. Think of it as a fly pattern book, an insect book, and a fly-fishing methodology/presentation book -- all topics covered perfectly and in a nice little package. The spiral bound version is nice when tying with the book open."
5,Fly fishing,Full of great tips for and learning how to identify insects. Well written and very well put together/designed. Would recommend this book.
4,Beneath The Hurtling Moons Of Barsoom...,"I first read this book as a boy in grade school. I loved it then, and I have loved it every time since then that I have reread it. Great literature? Probably not in the way other great literature is judged, but the character of John Carter remains, to me, the ultimate fictional hero, the one to solve all the problems when the chips were down, the one friend who could always be depended upon. I hear rumors now that, because of the successes of such fantasy classics as the Rings trilogy that Hollywood is seriously looking at the Warlord as material for a series of movies. I can only hope that they do a better job with him than they did with Tarzan."
5,"A Must-have for Kids, but Especially for Parents","I was attracted to the CD because of the worthy cause and the high-profile list of singers. But my husband and I play the CD during every car ride because of the combination of kid-friendly lyrics and adult-friendly music. A few of our favorites are ""Mockingbird,"" ""Angel's Lullaby,"" ""If I Had a Hammer,"" and ""You Are My Sunshine."" A timeless collection we will enjoy for years."
2,Just not what I expected!,Is this a CD for kids? There are great artists but they have sung most songs in a slow sedate manner. Not at all what would keep any of my kids interested! At least it's for charity.
5,Play it again....,"Ok, I haven't really listened to this recording yet, but I have the previous version: Disney for our Children, also to benefit the Pediatric AIDS Foundation...and it is WONDERFUL! In fact, I am looking for a second copy of the first version! Why wonderful? Because the music is varied, pleasant to the ear over repeated plays, and contains some pieces you can't find anywhere else. And kids love it..."
1,For Our Children is much better,"I was so disappointed with this CD I am writing my very first review for Amazon. The first CD in this ""collection"" is so fun and very charming. This one lacks on many levels."
1,Seller Should Be Prohibited From Your Site. Actions Shameful!,"I purchased a CD from Seller for $19.99 even though identical CD's were selling for between $29.00 - $75.00 on your site. The item was never shipped and although I received a credit, the seller immediately re-posted my CD for $29.00.I contacted the Seller three times via e-mail and each time I received a short, non-commital note claiming the item had shipped, although no specifics were provided. Finally after 3 weeks the Seller claimed the item must have been ""lost in the mail"" which is an obvious coverup. The Seller was unethical and greedy. Upon realizing they could get more money for the CD they simply defaulted on our agreement, as I paid immediately as I always do. Amazon has a good reputation, however if you allow such unethical and criminal actions to go unpunished I will be very dissapointed. Please provide me with information as to whatever sanctions you impose. Thank you."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,I am thankful that I was able to find these blades for my razor. They are excellent. Hope they will continue to carry them.
2,Weasels Ripped My Flesh,"These blades are way too aggressive for me. I think they just grab too much at once. I'm going to switch back to a 3-blade design. My favorite was the 2-blade Gillette Sensor, which I'm no longer able to find.I am an adult male and I have used these blades to shave my face 4-5 times a week for about one month."
3,Peels not so REal,Not as good as I thought : ( Wasn't really into the band as much as I thought I would be.
3,Vocalist Needed for Great Band,"Instrumentally, THE PEELS sound like one of the best bands in the business. That's good, since the band's name is truly awful. The band plays hard rock, not Top-40 pop, as their name suggests.But this CD, and the band, are most likely headed for oblivion. Every song starts out sounding very strong -- until the vocals cut in, and sink it. The thin whiny pop-song voice is badly mis-matched against hard rocking guitar bass and drum tracks.This was a big problem at their 2005 SXSW Showcase too, where the pop vocal stylings only served to undermine the instrumental playing, and made them ""just another boring band"" in concert. Even the local music media ignored them.If the Peels can't find a good vocalist, they're probably better off disbanding."
2,Don't see what the big deal is...,"I bought this DVD based on all the excellent reviews but was disappointed. You spend too long on each move (2 minutes of single-leg stretch-seems ok, but feels like an eternity) and it gets boring, but despite the almost constant exertion, I did not break a sweat or raise my heart rate very high. Also the exercisers were completely emotionless throughout the entire workout. It was like watching a bunch of robots. The good thing about this DVD is its attention to form. Rael clearly knows what he's talking about, so I would recommend this workout for people who are interested in the science of pilates, but for a regular exerciser, it's not worth it."
2,A stretch workout,I was so excited when I read the reviews for this intermediate level Pilates tape. Thought I would purchase it for variety from my 'The Method' Pilates tape. I was very disappointed. The tape does not even allow you to get your heart racing much less to break a sweat. I didn't feel like I got a good tone workout. I actually wanted to fall asleep. I felt it was 40 minutes of stretch for an intermediate level student. I give two stars because I do believe he knows what is talking about in terms of form but I shall be passing this on to an elderly relative.
3,"Great, but...",They keep coming out of my ears! I guess it would work bettter if I had more than 1 ear piercing per ear.
2,Design very different from photo.,"OK earrings, but the design on the glass beads on the pair I received was very different from the photo. I wouldn't have minded if they had stated in their description that the designs varied, but they didn't. The pair I received was much less blue than the photo and had a few tiny, different-colored flowers."
2,Boring and lack luster-dry as toast,"A classic case of ""don't judge the book by its cover"": While the cover is intriguing, this book is anything but. It is neither comprehensive nor balanced. Rather, its a dry re-run of historical sitings, peppered with a lot of information on fantasy prone personality syndrome. For people intrested in alien contacts, UFO history, and other unsolved mysteries, this will truly fail to satisfy."
2,Interesting concepts that don't follow through,"While the theoretical physics and computers in this book are true to life, the plot and characters seem to fall a little short.All of the action takes place in the author's home town, the main character is a picture of who the author seems to want to be, and the female lead is a cartoon of a woman who seems to have no desires or second thoughts outside of the protagonist.While the quantum nature of the story is a little heavy-handed, it seems to stick together for the most of the book, but some of the plot twists smack of the fabled 'plot hole' of D&D; fame. At one point, one of the characters disappears to return with just the right tools to solve the crisis and only a cursory explanation of how he got them.Later works by this author may be much better; there is some promise, but in the end the book falls flat."
4,loved so much they wore out,I thought the point of buying dvds is that they hold up under use unlike vhs. I was informed recently that yes dvds do wear out. I guess that's what we did. We love these shows! We watched them way too much. The dvds don't work anymore. :( We'll be buying more and hoping that it was a fluke. It's not the dvd player. Only these discs that don't work. I like that they teach lessons in every episode unlike other things that have no educational value what so ever.
2,1,disappointing poorly acted and directed with a boring story line - I watched about 15 minutes and shut it off
3,not what youd expect,"I met the cast of Inkubus and the directors, writers, etc right before this came out so naturally i purchased without seeing it first. it is a drawn out movie it seems and i got a little bored. I kept it to go with the autograph collection and robert englund merch in my home but if you arent a movie buff or if you dont have a collection like i do, i dont reccomend getting it. you may be dissapointed."
1,Unwatchable. Horror fans beware,"I rarely leave a movie at the theaters but this was one of them. Everything about this movie is terrible. The plot, the special effects, the acting, the low carb Freddie krueger they tried to create, just all around a big giant mess. Mystery science theater should get their hands on this trainwreck."
3,Decent Collection,"Smooth Grooves: A Sensual Collection, Vol. 8 it isn't as consistent as earlier volumes in the series, but it contains a number of forgotten quiet storm classics from the late '70s and early '80s, including Levert's ""(Pop, Pop, Pop, Pop) Goes My Mind,"" and The Emotions' ""Don't Ask My Neighbors,"" Miki Howard's ""Come Share My Love"" and Larry Graham's ""When We Get Married,"" among several other winners. One of my favorite songs on the CD is Atlantic Starr's Let's Get Closer but the standout on this CD is Who Can I Run to by the Jones Girls. The stunning ballad enjoyed a wide, spacious mix that generously showcased both the great lead vocals of Shirley Jones and her sisters' sweet harmonies. It stands as the Jones Girls' best ballad. The closing riff is sufficiently low-key and melodramatic with muted trumpet and soft flute. Xscape's 1995 gold cover pretty much adhered to the Jones Girls' original unsurpassed version."
2,Not good or not bad either,"This is an ok book is not all that bad. I actually went through this book and found it be a seet of reasonably well annotated games. The title is overhyped but the annotations have good clear annotations with a lot of diagrams. This is a perfectly fine book for a C or B class player who can get something useful out of it. Are there books that do the same thing this book does better? Sure there are, in particular Edmar Mednis book Strategic Chess is a better choice. But if you find this book in a used book bin in good condition, you could do worse by picking this book up."
2,Making meaning out of Literature - She reads to live,"This work is in a sense in the spirit of Sartre's reading of Existensialism. It is Man cast alone in the Universe, but here facing a text, and making meaning out of it. The work of fiction and the work of life together are meaning- making - interpretations. And Dillard reads not only to understand but to live.I understand and appreciate this way of thinking very much. And Dillard's elegance in defending it is clear.However 'what exactly we live for' the 'precise values' outside of 'reading and interpreting' are not so clear to me.'Truth, Beauty and Goodness"" would seem to me not simply a supplement to 'meaning making interpretation' but a way of enriching and making more meaningful their 'content'."
3,"Defining Art: Well, Kind Of","I'm a fan of Annie Dillard. Pilgrim at Tinker Creek is one of my favorites. Living by Fiction is just as sharp, just as honest, and yet it's less curious, less humble. I found Dillard's investigation into the meaning of literary art rather dry and shallow. She sought out the most exemplary in literature: Nabokov, Borges, Marquez, and asks what makes contemporary art work. How does she conclude? Basically with an existential shrug of the shoulders. I was often chastised in graduate school for writing a research paper with too large a thesis, and although at the time I disagreed, now I understand exactly what my professors meant. I finished this book with little more than a bunch of loose juxtapositions. Meanwhile, Dillard's sparkling style will cause me to go back to her again and again. Her writing is always enjoyable to read. Even when the content is lacking."
2,Enough Hot Air to Fill a Balloon,"I'd consider myself a fairly well rounded reader, but unfortunately, I just couldn't handle this text. It's dense, wordy, and highly opinionated; so opinionated, in fact, that I feel as if I am being talked down to by the author. If you need something to help you fall asleep, look no further."
2,One size does not fit all,"This product would probably be very good if it lived up to its billing of being one size fits all. Actually it will go up to about 44"". No where does the product info tell the actual length of the belt. As I am a couple inches over their max, I am going to have to see about returning it."
2,Nice appearance is only temporary.,Tightening drags the belt against claw teeth. After several week's wearing those teeth abraded the surface leaving increasingly ugly stripes of fuzzy broken fibers. Other web belts fasten with a knurled roller that engages only when released. Now I understand why.
2,No real melodies,"These bells just seem to clank and clammer, they don't have the same sound of cathedrals in Western Europe. Sounds more primative and rural. Which is probably typical for a Russian-Orthodox Church. At first I was disappointed, but the combination clinks and clanks grew interesting and almost funny."
5,Amazing book!,"I bought this book when my new home was a twinkle in my eye. I love the mediterranean home. I had this one on my wish list at amazon. My daughter saw the list and gave it to me for Christmas. Turns out it's the best gift I've gotten. I have carried this book around with me now for 8 mths, and still using it. I worked with a designer on our custom home plans, and now using some ideas on the interior design of my home. Awesome book!"
2,Nothing to do with mediteranean,"I have a library full of interior design books, morocco and mediteranean design. This book however has nothing, really nothing to do with mediteranean design. It is better subscribed as "" having to much money and building tasteless American design house""With all the respect for American design of course But this can not be called design, yeah in the 60's maybe..The only nice thing is the good layouts / plans of houses. But all of them are ugly really...I can't understand the rating for this book, perhaps cause I am Dutch.."
4,Pioneer PL-990 Turntable,"This is a great turntable all around. It was easy to setup, use, and sounds great through my Denon receiver.There are two things I don't like about the turntable. First, there is no power on/off switch. To start playing a record you just push play. Which is fine, but I'm old fashioned and like the idea of a power switch. The second, the RCA jack connector cable is way too short. I just happened to have a spare set of cables and just had to purchase a set of female/female adapter connectors. If you purchase this product be aware that you will have to make up for the shortness of the RCA jack connector cable by purchasing addition cabling."
1,Incredibly cheap,I am astonished that Pioneer would put their name on this horrible product which is no more than a flimsy piece of molded plastic.
1,Buyer Beware: No Belt Included!!,"I received my turntable today and was horrified to discover no drive belt is included, which means no music unless I go out and buy a belt separately. This is unacceptable and the second time it has happened through Amazon. Incidentally, I bought this directly from Amazon and not a private retailer through Amazon. So the moral of the story seems to be not to buy electronics from Amazon.Shipping: The player arrived a day early but with minimal protection in a banged-up box.I am returning my turntable tomorrow and will buy another one from a more trustworthy retailer."
1,Ridiculous customer service by Amazon,"So this is a product review, and a seller review. I've included both because Amazon was the seller and I cannot (oddly enough) make a seller review?? The item was delivered in in early December, in its production box, even though I requested that it get delivered as a gift. Obviously, my wife knew what it was when she came home from work. Xmas gift ruined. We went on vacation the day after Christmas. Upon returning two weeks ago, we opened the record player, plugged it in, and voila...it doesn't spin. The internal motor is broken. I've done everything I can reasonably do to test this unit. But sInce I bought this in early December, we are outside of the return window. Amazon does not want to help us. The item is junk. I feel like I've been robbed.DO NOT BUY THIS RECORD PLAYER. Amazon will cheat you and send you a broken unit that was previously returned by someone else."
2,pioneer pl990 fully auto turntable,advertised as fully automatic and is not fully automatic. does not repeat automaticlly to play record over and over. does not play more than one 45 record at a time there for you have to do it manually. so advertising it as fully automatic is a false advertisment. player ok if you have nothing better to do to change 45 records every 3 min.
5,Wonderful to be playing vinyl again!,"My son pulled out a crate of about 80 vinyl records (classic rock from the 60's/70's/80's) from a crawl space in our house and declared we really needed to get a turntable. I found this one on Amazon and it was really easy to hook up to my older Sony receiver and Bose speakers that I had down in the basement. Let me tell you, it is wonderful to be listening to vinyl records again. Both my boys (ages 16 & 20) are also enjoying it. Great player, easy to use, great sound...don't hesitate if you've been yearning to get back to the old vinyl records..."
5,nice turntable-good value,Needed to replace my Pioneer PLA-25 turntable from 1972 to play my vinyl.This turntable works very well for low price and a lot of plastic. It isfully auto with a dampened dust cover and a metal turntable with rubber mat. Be forewarned that RC wires to A/V are short and you may need to have to add extensions. The preamp cannot be turned off either. It soundsgreat and I should be able to replace the needle for under 10 dollars.Has a speed adjust but have not had to use it. Very happy with it.
4,Good turntable for the new collector,I needed a turntable as i wanted to start collecting LPs. This turntable has everything the new guy needs. The only downside is you need to manually adjust the speed based on power input frequency (50 or 60 hertz). But for the price this thing sounds great and has worked flawlessly. And you can't go wrong with the Pioneer name IMHO.
4,Nice turntable for the price,"I recently dug out a couple of crates of 33's from the 60s and 70s that had been stored in my garage for over 20 years. Decided to buy a low-end turntable and, because I have always had good luck with Pioneer products, purchased this online for under a hundred bucks at Pioneer's website. To my amazement the records played like new even though they were used and abused. I didn't mind that the turntable doesn't allow you to use Phono Input jacks; my old receiver had an 'LD"" option for RCA cables....speaking of which, the RCA cables are SUPER SHORT and I had to buy a $2 RCA connector here on Amazon. Other than that minor inconvenience, I really like this turntable. It's probably the least expensive around; ignore reviewers who complain about inexpensive products that don't perform like thousand dollar items!"
3,first turntable,i am not sure even how to rate this turn table! casue i am fresh to RECORDS and though this was a good starting point! its even hoked up to an old 6 year old AMP with 2 channels only. i am looking and reading more - some say the next step isDenon DP-29F Analog TurntableorDenon DP-200USB Fully Automatic Turntable with MP3 Encoderbut this one is sturdy -
5,"Great product, very pleased!","Product was delivered in excellent shape, has great quality sound. Very pleased with performance."
5,Pioneer PL-990 Automatic Stereo Turntable,I am happy with this turntable. I am not a music critic. I was looking for something with sound quality that would play my old albums well and remind me of the good old days!!
3,"Cute Story, Wrong Crop!","We had picked this book from our local library. My daughter and I were enjoying the story until we came to the mouse in the story. I have nothing against cute story book mice, however the text says the feather got caught on a corn stalk. I have no idea how, but it never got caught (and corrected) the text may say ""cornstalk"" but the illustrator drew wheat! That completely ruined the book for me. I'm sure there is some kid out there that thinks wheat is a cornstalk from reading this book."
4,Not as good as the other SNL disks,"I remember Mike Myers being in a lot of funny sketches, but they didn't seem to include many on this disk. I really enjoyed the Wayne's World sketches, and Sprockets (although I would have like to see the one with Phil Hartman dressed as Heidi). Theatre Stories was OK, and the Tokyo Game Show was on the Chris Farley DVD. Most of the other sketches were pretty blah and I found myself reaching for the fast forward several times. Philip (where he plays a hyperactive child) was surprisingly boring. Middle Aged Man and Lothar were also pretty [bad]. I remember liking these on the show, but maybe my tastes have changed? Maybe they just picked some of the [bad] sketches?Make sure you check out the extras -- there was a very funny Scottish Soccer fan sketch in there.Oh, I found that the menus on this disk were poorly done and took forever to navigate, at least on my DVD player."
4,A few good laughs,"Overall, some okay skits, but many lame skits. The Tokyo gameshow is hilarious because of Chris Farley. The other good skit is Mike Myers as the English Patient in WWII with Rob Schnieder as Hitler. The sprockets skits, coffee talk and Wayne's World skits aren't that funny. You can see where much of his Austin Powers material comes from in this DVD"
1,mike myers worst of,"ok this i thought would be a good one but it was as good as the love guru and if you have seen that then if you have common sense you will not buy this item i have 22 best ofs and the molly shannon one was better if you are going to buy a best of buy chris farely, will ferrell or tv funhouse those are the funniest so far"
3,Fun Stuff,"If you're a Saturday Night Live fan or a Mike Meyers fan, you'll enjoy these skits, etc from SNL. Fun to watch."
3,"I'm a big Mike Myers fan, but.....","I was disappointed with this DVD. Like others have said, I don't think they had the BEST skit, just the skit with the most famous person. It was nice seeing the lesser known Mike Myer skits, but then again, I would have rather seen the funniest skits.The best skit by far is the one with Nicole Kidman where he is the kid chained to the jungle gym.I wouldn't discourage a diehard fan from getting this DVD, but be warned that it's not as exciting as you are expecting.I was going to get the Adam Sandler SNL collection for my boyfriend, but now am wary about it."
4,Attention Mike Myers fans!,"This video is perfect for any Mike Myers fan and has many hillarious skits. Such as wayne, Dieter, Philip, and many more. Although there are a couple skits that didn't really belong on the video, but, still, it is great."
2,A little let down,"I'd have to say that I felt a little let down. I am a Mike Myers fan from way back. This is not the best of Mike Myers. It seemed like the only reason some of these skits made it on the DVD is because someone more famous was in the skit as well. I loved the Aerosmith/Wayne's World skit and the Sprockets, but the others were mediocre. I anticipate another ""best of"" for Myers and pray it will live up to its title."
3,If you weren't there...,"Not being American, I have never watched the show. So I was basing my expectations on films in which I have seen these comedians.It should be said perhaps that I am not a huge fan of stand-up comedy, I find it usually strained. But anyway, I am vaguely disappointed. I bought The Best Of Steve Martin and of Mike Meyers, and... well, while they are clearly both amongst our most talented comedians, I feel that the material on these DVDs is really not that damn good. I mean the writing, the sketches. Particularly considering that these are *best of* collections.I dunno... I guess you had to be there."
2,Definitely not his best,"I agree with other reviewers who said this ""Best of"" video does not begin to include Myers' best stuff from SNL. Some of the editing choices are downright inexplicable.For example, one of Myers' funniest impersonations is of Ronnie Wood, which he did just three times on SNL. The first sketch was by far the best -- hysterical -- while the other two were pretty much forgettable. So what are we given on this video? You guessed it -- not the first.The exact same thing is true for Sprockets, Coffee Talk and most of his other classic characters and sketches.This video is very disappointing and is a perfect example of why NBC/Broadway Video should make COMPLETE SNL EPISODES (if not complete seasons) available for purchase."
3,Young and exciting,"I loved this cast and hoped that some would return on the new series.This 90210 series just makes me want to get the others, the plot and scenarios are educational and funny. Appreciated the who complete first season and look forward to purchasing the others."
5,Wife loved it.,Bought this product for my wife. She loves the set since it comes with added bonus features. Good thing to buy for someone who liked the series.
4,Very Nostalgic!,"After years of saying 90210 (& Melrose Place) should be on dvd, I was so excited to see it in the stores. My husband purchased it for me for Christmas & I've already made it through most of the first disc. My husband & I both get a kick out of watching how the fashion has evolved, etc. Especially funny to me was seeing how huge the one or two cell phones were!I actually give it 4 1/2 stars-- not a five only b/c there are no scene selections; the pilot, which is listed as part 1 & 2, is not broken up, so be prepared to watch for 2 hours straight! Fine if you're not busy, but if you're always on the go, just make sure you make time for it! :)I already can't wait for Season 2."
5,Still love the 90210 gang!,"If you're a die-hard fan and have been waiting for Beverly Hills 90210 to come out on dvd, then this is for you! The first season is just as funny and great as I remember, and it's so much fun watching it again now. A perfect gift for anyone wanting to remember the best show ever!"
3,"Hmmm, kind of a boring start to a great show.","I just finished this season and I have to say that I found it a little bit boring. I also thought the music was so generic that it was tacky. I was a big fan of the show when it was on the air and I am not going to give up on it. I started the second season and I already like it more. It is so interesting to watch the show as a very young adult and then watch it again as a middle aged mother. Man, that Brenda was a brat!! I am excited to get some of the other seasons on dvd and hope that the music gets a little bit better."
5,About time!!!!,"Hooray for common sense. Roll on November, can't wait!!! All those dodgy ebay sellers will shaking in their boots, no longer making copious amounts of money selling cheap, TV recorded episodes. Well done in making this series available. I'm oh so excited, yay!!!!!"
4,Where it started,"Brandon had a mullet and Brenda was still very innocent. What they encountered was the posh of posh-est schools with all sorts of new friends and enemies. From the ditzy Donna, to pretty Kelly, right down to the rebel himself, Dylan.This first season especially is good to watch and goes right to deep issues. Dylan's especially has really stressful issues what with his father.Nice to reminisce and watch the old gang."
2,Different Music,"This is for the person who wondered if theorginal music would be used. Sorry to bethe one to post this, but no it will not.They hired a composer to compose new music.It is because of music rights. It wouldhave drove up the price of the DVD.They might use the orginal music hereand there but for the most part it willnot be the same. I Rated it 2 Starsonly because of the different music."
2,Season 2 and 3 review,"I REALLY HATED that they had to dub the original music on the DVD version. I esp. hated that Losing My Religion was dubbed, and all the songs by Cathy Dennis were all dubbed in the senior prom episode, it's horrible, just watch soapnet don't buy this dvd you'll get ripped off."
5,Not Disappointed!,"I ordered this for my sister who is 16 because she was watching reruns on television and enjoyed it. I figured she would enjoying receiving the DVD set as well and boy was I not wrong. When she got this all she wanted to do was open it and watch it, which she did. I'm not disappointed and she isn't disappointed. So I'm very happy with the service and rapid shipping on this product. You can be sure I'll be ordering Season 2 as well as all the others just as soon as I can."
2,yeah,"I once sold the entire first season on VHS on ebay when I was 13. The quality was better, my tapes had the original music, and werent missing any scenes. If that knowledge doesn't bother you then run out and buy these dvds. If you really want to collect the show...start setting your tivos on FX.another question...what is going to happen in season 3. I flat out will not watch brenda crying over dylan without losing my religion. i will not watch ditch day without color me badd or the finale without blood is thicker than water. they seriously need to do something about this because at some point (if i admit that it doesn't matter now) the music is really going to make a huge difference."
1,A big let down!!!,"We have purchased a lot of poor quality 90210 tapes. Finally we thought we would have a dvd with our favorite show! NOT - all the music has been changed. As my daughter said they replaced the original music that in many ways was a big part of each episode and put in random ""circus"" type music. Much of the music is not even from the same era. I will be trying to send mine back and once again watch my very fuzzy epsiodes - because no matter how bad the quality at least it is the original 90210! Isn't that what we thought we were getting????????"
5,Back in the 90's,"I just can say, I felt like a teenager again :). Whenever this show was originally on, I was 18 and up and watching it now, was kinda travelling through time. Very recommandable, if you like the old shows!"
2,Great show but DVD release is horrible!!,As a teenager I loved this show. Now that I am in my 30's I still love the show but.....the DVD release of Season One is just horrible !!They couldn't get the rights to the original music so they replaced it with some really lame punk/rock/elevator music. I hate it. The show isn't the same without the original music.If I would have known that all the episodes had the music changed I would have never purchased the DVD.I am very dissapointed and I hope the studio re-releases it with the ORIGINAL music.
2,NOT original music in episodes,"BOOOOOO!!!! Most likely because of music rights issues, the discs do NOT contain the originally broadcast songs in it. You can imagine my dissapointment upon hearing Brenda debating shoplifting a silk vest to a scratch music track (generic) rather than to Soho's ""Hippie Chick"" as I remember it.Unfortunately, I didnt read the back cover of the disc set thoroughly prior to ripping off the plastic wrap otherwise this DVD set would have been returned."
4,Is the music the same on the DVD as in the original series?,I am so excited this is finally out--- I have been waiting FOREVER!!!!However I kept hearing they weren't going to get rights to the original music. Does anyone know if the original music is on Season 1?
3,Bad Manufacturing,"I thought that I got a bad DVD in the mail when i recieved my copy, but I've been sent another and I still have the same problem. Has anyone noticed that the episodes are messed up? Several episodes are on there twice with different titles on the menu. Who ever put this thing together really didn't do a very good job. Forget about the music...I want my missing episodes back!!"
3,Slow Start...,"and i thought it was only Melrose Place that was weak in the beginning.I'm mid-way through Season 2 right now, and I gotta say: 90210 isn't a very good show yet. while there are a few Season 1 episodes that hint at entertainment: ""The First Time"", ""Higher Education"", ""B.Y.O.B"", ""Slumber Party"", ""Home Again"" - for the most part, 90210 hasn't found itself yet..."
5,Witty and Wonderful,Historical fiction with a sense of humor. This book has a very Douglas Adams feel to it. Great as a quick and entertaining read.
4,Beautiful pictures!,"The illustrations are gorgeous, the poetry is quick-witted. The only reason I couldn't give this book a perfect rating is that I thought it was too advanced for my first graders and went past the basic definition of nouns to more complex skills like determiners."
2,"Oddly shaped forks, felt very cheap","I ordered this silverware set for my apartment. As a bachelorette, I don't have outrageously high standards, but this set fell well below my expectations. The forks are very oddly shaped. The overall quality was very cheap - more like what I would expect out of a $10 set from Ikea. The edges seemed rough. I returned the product after receiving it. As a caution: if you are ordering for a gift, my package arrived somewhat beat-up looking and probably not appropriate for presentation."
2,very overrated and dated nutcracker,"THE LONDON SYNPHONY PLAY WELL,BUT DORATI IS TO COLD AND MECHANICAL.WHY SO MANY MUSIC CRITICS AND CLASSICAL MUSIC PEOPLE LIKE DORATI WITH TCHAIKOVSKYS MUSIC I CAN NOT FIGURE OUT."
4,Pretty Good,"Well I bought this just a couple of weeks ago. It came very quickly, which let me have time to fix it up for a birthday present. It comes in a dandy little Kingdom Hearts logo box and just as perfect as the picture. The only problem I could say is that you don't get a choice of ring option, and it comes pretty big.But as it's somewhat of a cosplay item, I'm sure it's to fit a growing boy's hand. Very nice product."
3,It's alright,"Not sure why this is branded as a ""toy"", but hey, whatever the seller wants.The chain is very durable, albeit short. The clasp and charm tend to break very easily (cheap graphite painted silver) and the ring bends easily (copper painted silver). The ring rubs off its coating after about a week or so, making ugly black marks on your skin from the copper underneath. It's okay, but not really the best type of this product out there."
2,What's going on?,"This guide is no better than John Swenson's ""Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide"" from 1985. That guide failed to include ""Birth of the Cool"", ""Round 'bout Midnight"" and ""Sketches of Spain"" by Miles Davis, ""Time Further Out"" by Dave Brubeck, and omitted the entire Buddy Rich discography. Yikes! It also gave different ratings to indentical collaborations which appeared twice in the guide. Rolling Stone guides are usually life-savers. I have had wonderful luck using their rock music guides. Why can't Rolling Stone get it together with jazz?"
3,A Disappointing Incomplete Album Guide,"This book is a disappointment...I could not believe how many newer titles were missing. For example, was the author asleep during 1998? Although the publishing date is 1999, many albums released in 1998 were notably absent. It sometimes looks like an entire artist's section was lifted from the R. S. Album Guide of 1992 and inserted without revision or an update. While some gospel artists are included others are missing. It's sad that Rolling Stone can get away with presenting such an incomplete product. Although this book is a fair addition to a Rock N Roll library, there are much better guides available for your money (e.g., the AMG guides)."
2,Where's Joe McPhee?,"At a signing on 6/4/99, I asked John Swenson why there was no entry for Joe McPhee. He lamely answered ""Is any of his stuff in print?"", ""Uh, yes,"" I said, ""on HatArt, HatHut."" ""Oh, those are imports..."" I guess if you want a vanilla introduction to jazz, this is a good place to start. To really learn about the subject, and to explore the more creative personalities, you'll have to look elsewhere... Though they get two stars for a lovely endorsement of Anthony Braxton's Charlie Parker Project 1993."
2,Useful but flawed,"This book is a noble but flawed effort. The omissions are inexcusable. No Furry Lewis? No Jimmy Rogers? While the task of compiling such a guide is monumental, this book would have benefitted from better editing."
2,Needs some work.,"I came across this book at my local bookstore one day. Next to it on the shelf was a much older Rough Guide to Jazz that was about half the thickness of the RS J&B Album Guide. To my surprise, the Rough Guide had a section on saxophonist/clarinetist Bob Wilbur and the R.S. Guide had nothing about him at all! Thus, if you are at all interested in early jazz, give this one a miss."
5,Fog lights,There's no visible difference with this fog light than the ones from the dealership that cost $102.00. I'm very satisfied
4,It does what it is supposed to do.,"It does what it is supposed to do. As it is a light, it would take years to get a good usage review out of it. But, It does what it is supposed to do. The shipper did a good job at getting it to me in the correct amount of time. However, the business took a lot longer to acutally ship it than what was quoted. Otherwise it's good."
4,Perfect Fit,"Worked out great, just like the original lights. Bulb was included - just had to remove the old and plug these in. Simple ten minute install"
4,Use the existing mount.,"The mounting bracket on this is so flimsy it needs to be replaced with the factory mount. I would not recommend this product unless you have the original mount still in one piece (if you do, it's really easy to replace and a great price). Reading through the reviews someone else also did this. I'm glad I read the reviews.I replaced the driver side with another brand over a year ago and the mount was definitely lower quality and flimsier than the factory, but it was acceptable. This one is definitely outside of my tolerance range."
5,Hercules is an Understatement!,"I just received my stand and it is better than I imagined. I play acoustic guitar, electric bass and mandolin. I searched high and low for a stand that could handle all. This is the one. It is built like a tank. Extremely solid and sturdy. The auto grab system is awesome, especially for the small neck and headstock of my mandolin. Set the instrument on the yoke and the weight of the instrument pulls the yoke down an inch and two levers flip up to trap the instrument in the yoke! Grab the instrument and lift ever so slightly and the levers flip down to release the instrument.Next purchase will be a half dozen of the wall mount version to replace the wall mounts for my electric guitar collection.Note, I did not see this stand in person before buying but I looked over their web-site. Had I actually seen one, I would have paid up to $100 for it. I think it is a steal at $60."
3,Know your guitars before you buy!,"It's an excellent guitar stand. I trust in Hercules products, but its stability was not the problem. I own different sized guitars/basses, I understand this is a guitar stand. Some fit well, but unfortunately some of my guitars didn't. Let's say you have a large acoustic, another guitar with an unorthodox body shape, another guitar that is long and lengthy (more like a bass size), the guitars may overlap, hit the floor instead of the padding, etc. I bought it thinking it would save my medium-sized room space, but it felt like it took even more space up. In this case, I feel it is better to go to your local music shop first to see if it meets your needs."
5,great stable stand,"this is probably the best stand i've owned so far. the stand stays stable with 1, 2 or 3 guitars on. i will definitely buy another one again for the rest of my guitars and basses."
1,Stands plastic parts break,These Hercules stands will break because of cheap plastic parts that are used and then it is not possible to find replacement parts to fix them. Do not buy these stands.
5,Good hiking pants,"I use these to go hiking, and on long road trips. The material is light, breathes, is water-resistant, and easy to care for. They easily convert to shorts. Enough pockets for me; one is zippered with a Velcro flap. A forgiving waistband (with a bit of elastic) allows me to wear them after the holidays. I am very satisfied with these pants, and after using them every weekend for several months, I can't think of any way to improve them. These pants are a winner."
3,"I like the functionality, just not the fit.","These pants do what they say they'll do. The zipper to convert them into long shorts is a little wonky, but overall, they are good travel pants. However, if you are ""hippy"" like me, you'll find you need to go up one to two sizes to fit the hips (even AFTER following the sizing requirements) - unfortunately this results in a very baggy look around the slimmer leg, which I don't really care for. I'll continue to use these, but I won't buy another pair."
3,Ok,"They come wide, but were perfect for my thick legs and hips. I'm not crazy about the color. Pockets and zipper are very practical"
3,Do not follow their size chart,"I am usually a size 0 or 2 in pants, depending on the brand. Following the size chart of Royal Robbins, I decided that a 4 might be better. Well, it was REALLY big (and too late for exchange because I was leaving the day after I received it). Don't follow their size chart and take your usual size.Otherwise the pants are ok(not very flattering) and dry quickly."
2,"Royal Robbins Women's Zip N' Go Pant, Everglade, 6/Regular","These did not fit as they were suppose to and were way too long. They required almost removing 8"" of the leg which makes the pants not usable except as shorts."
3,A bit disappointed,"I bought my 1st pair of these pants for a trip to the Galapagos a few years ago. I loved them so much that I ordered another pair for a trip to Africa. The new ones are still good pants, but not the same high quality of the first pair. The stitching in the zipper and the button by it were all connected and I had to fight to open them the 1st time, leaving strings hanging all over the place that had to be trimmed. The zipper is much shorter than the one in the 1st pair, making less flex in the fit. I still like them, but wish they were more like the 1st pair."
3,just so so,"I don't like this jacket so much. I thought it can keep warm, but just so so. And the size is a bit small."
2,Boring,"""The Last Human"" continues the adventures of Lister, Rimmer, The Cat, and Kryten. It also adds in the Kochanski character also is added as a member of the cast. Overall, the characters have devolved from being fully formed and enjoyable, to being bland and fairly dull. The plot leaps, of course, from improbability to impossibility, but with little of the humor that make ""Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers"" or even ""Better Than Life"" enjoyable. Fans of the series will want to read this entry in the series, but those who are looking to have a casual read will probably want to pass.J.Ja"
4,best value,"I tried lots of other brands. Store brands are generally cheaper for daily printing needs. Compared to others (Staples, office max etc) I think office depot's 24lb white printing paper is better both in terms of quality and price. I buy these to print stuff for myself, maps, emails etc., and they work fine. But if you want to print something for business purposes, to submit or give someone else, job applications, you wouldn't want this one. You need something at least 28 lbs in that case.But using heavy paper for daily printing is not really environmental friendly. That's why i prefer light weight ones. I had tried 20lbs too, but really believe me, if you have an injet printer, you wouldn't want to print on a 20 lb paper. That's why 24lbs is the optimum, at least for me."
5,Pay No Attention to That Small Person Behind the Curtain!,"Sorry...no offense intended, but the ""Kid's Review"" is, well...Having used this paper for years I can attest to its superb quality. Dollar for dollar, this is probably the best value out there! Virtually NO print-through: perfect for double-sided pages (I even print my desktop-published textbooks on it!). For the price you simply cannot go wrong with this stock.2008 Update: Just make sure you're getting the real deal. My last order contained an unknown generic brand of decidedly inferior quality! Amazon made it good, of course (bless 'em)."
4,Works well,"I like this paper better than the HP paper...the HP paper seems to stick together more in clumps of pages. The Office Depot paper looks good when I print on it. As for the other reviewer's comment about holes, I don't know what she's talking about, I write all over this paper with different types of pens and it has never been a problem."
4,good paper,"The paper is very good, but the package needed to be sturdier it got dinged slightly in shipment."
1,Argh!!,"Every time I write on it holes go right through it! Dont by this! If you fold it, it rips in the fold!! Dont Buy this!!! You will be sorry!"
3,Make sure you have some time before you open,Bought this for my 3 year old son and two of my nephews. Took forty minutes to unscrew all the screws to get it out of box. Once it's out of the box I find that there are more screws to unscrew in order to get the wheels to turn. By this time 3 year old is in tears because it's taking sooo long.Not very durable and very loud. Since I did not want to torture my sister-in-law who is not handy with tools I'm going to replace two of the machines for anther brand.
3,Toy for one day,"This loader sucks the power out of the required four AA batteries after a 24 hour period. I've gone through four sets of AA batteries in four days. I'd like to return this truck, but it was a gift from my family in the States and we're living overseas. There is no phone number or working e-mail address for Toy State. I'm stuck with this thing my son loves but can't play with."
2,Unreliable toy,"My son received this toy as a present only a week ago. He has played with it several times, but has not been rough with the toy at all. Today, the function on the remote that controls the movement stopped functioning. While trying to find a contact number for the manufacturer online, I found many reviews for this toy and many like it. They all seem to have similar problems with the remote. And it is repeated over and over again that the company contact information is not accessible. I did notice when we opened the package there was no instructions or information sheet as comes with most toys."
5,Very soothing !,I accidently came across this CD in a local library. This was my first exposure to African music and since then I have gotten hooked up to the genre.The tracks are soothing and brings me back to basics.If you like graceland by Paul Simon you will not be disappointed by the CD tracks.
5,Fallen Angel Palace,"Fallen Angel Palace has some of the most brilliant songs on it I've ever heard, plus a couple of the goofiest. My sister's kids love it, too, and sing to it in the car every morning on the way to school. Brent Mitchell is one heck of a songwriter."
2,Disappointed.......,"I had only read one book by this author previously and found that one to be a fast paced story that only took a couple of days to read but what I enjoyed about it the most was the omission of foul language. I am not a prude and most of the books I read do have some offensive language in them.But this book ""Once In Every Life"" was filled with profanity, and especially the use of God, Jesus, and Christ in conjunction with swearing. Far more than was necessary to get the author's point across. I am disappointed as I ordered three of her books at the same time and I am hoping they are more like the first book but afraid they will be like this one.Ms. Hannah ruined a beautiful story by using too many pages for swear words. Just one reader's humble opinion....."
2,"A sweet story, but with a fatal flaw","The fatal flaw in this novel is the heroine - on the back cover she is described as ""a brilliant research scientist"". Why, then, does she turn into the epitome of a prarie wife with no greater pleasure than learning to master cooking on a wood-burning stove? The hero's 12 year old daughter was doing the cooking before....how could a woman who is educated and intelligent be content in a cabin with no books, no intellectual life whatsoever and no one to really converse with? How could she possibly be happy doing chores a 12 year old child can do????"
5,Get ready to be transformed into this book.,"This is the first time travel novel that actually has made me feel as if I am in the shoes of the main character. You feel the pain, longing, tears, and joy of each person in this story. I have read this book eight times and I share it with my friends, old and new. I absolutely love Kristin Hannah and the wonderful stories that she creates. I don't hesitate to pick up one of her new releases and head straight to the check-out before I've even read what the story is about."
3,"Entertaining, but not complete","I enjoyed this DVD, but I wish that Purple would do one of these themselves. This is an independent DVD with some great interview with Nick Simper (who is still bitter evidently) and Glenn Hughes (who gives a great interview). There is some cool footage, and classic interview clips included, nothing too rare though. It would be great to see a full career comprehensive documentary with all living members of the band done record by record, with some remastered footage mixed in."
5,excellent survey of congressional activities,"Despite the fact that Mayhew's ""Congress: The Electoral Connection"" was published in 1986, the congressional goals discussed by Mayhew are still very relevant. Mayhew discusses three possible Congressional goals: 1)reelection, 2)gaining influence, and 3)producing good public policy. He also discusses the factors that effect the actions of Congressmen, such as: political parties, constituencies, committees, political action commitees, house and senate leadership, etc..."
3,Educational but boring,"I had to read this book for my political science class and it was very informative on what drives politicians to seek and retain office. However, the language was hard to understand and I was highly bored reading this."
1,Really?,Mayhew comes to the earth-shaking conclusion that politicians want to be re-elected. Do you really need to read a book to tell you that -- give me a break! This was known by my grandfather who never attended school beyond the third-grade. Save your time and save your money.
2,Short amaturish video where the content does not match the title,Ended up being all about Mr McCluskeys history.Gave me no tools (information) that I could use. A big disappointment.
2,Meh...,"Unfortunately this was poorly filmed. The background noise is icky. Also, I was hoping for some kind of demonstration...Nothing like that. I highly recommend Alyssa Cohen's DVD's since she talks about the benefits of this lifestyle along with demonstrations on various raw dishes and methods. This video just felt like a lecture."
5,Perfect addition to a gorillapod,"I don't remember how I found this originally, but it's an excellent addition to a gorillapod, which otherwise lacks any ability to move the camera other than reconfiguring the tripod. I'm sure there are far higher quality ballheads, but this has an excellent fit and finish. I used to use it with my D70, and now use it regularly with a Nikon D7000 and the Nikon 18-70 lens. No slippage, and it's never once flopped over."
2,Does not have and independent Panning Lock,"Good head, good cost to value relationship. However the description says it has an independent Panning lock. Nope .. it does not the MH-1002 does ... but this baby doesn't. I question the 8.8lbs ... from my experience it's more like 5 lbs. That said ... if the description was accurate I'd have no complaints. If you expecting the lock and capacity ... better look elsewhere."
5,Classy and Complete,"I recently found out that I am expecting my third, and probably last, child and I decided to find a journal in which to record my pregnancy so that I could really savor and appreciate this special time. This book is more than I expected!! The charming illustrations have a vintage feel that will still look classic when your baby is grown. The book is divided into sections: pregnancy, health and development, first year, second year,etc on up to the fifth year. The book has a chunky feel that makes you want to curl up with it and reminisce. It is a resource for all of the names and phone numbers you'll need to record as a parent but it also guides you into capturing all of those special ""firsts"" and memories (ie. favorite foods & recipes, favorite songs, quotes from your child's teachers)that you'll enjoy looking back on when your child is grown. I am really looking forward to filling up this book."
1,Clicking noise of death...,"I have the 60G version of this drive. I bought it for the small form factor (good).It never left the neoprene pouch and almost always sat on my desk. It was never bumped or otherwise mishandled.The first died just under warranty, and was eventually replaced by Apricorn. The new one died just OUT of warranty and I was told to go away. No consideration for previous problems, just ""too bad"".The clicking noise is a VERY bad sign.Never again."
4,Great book for an intermediate reader,"While I found this book useful in helping me learn more about the terms used in the Catholic religion, I felt this book was a bit challenging to read and understand. It's like a dictionary. For each term listed in the book, it goes in a brief detail what it means. The book also discusses the important saints throughout the Catholic history. The book also includes:Popes throughout out Catholic HistoryEcumenical CouncilsThe Documents of Vatican Council IIPapal Encclicals"
3,Hit or Miss; Some chapters are good; others are very bad,This book has chapters written by a variety of authors. Some of the authors write very well; others leave something to be desired. The text by Balint Kacsoh is a much better overall buy.I used both texts in an endocrinology course.
2,iowa ring,"This ring I wouldn't recommend, because it tarnish's which I purchased for my husband for a birthday gift. Very disappointed.Would not recommend to my friends."
3,Before Hollywood,Before Hollywood by The Go-Betweens is a strong album. The track Cattle and Cane is a classic.
4,Nice Art Nouveau photo album,"This is quite a nice photo-album of the Art Nouveau movement of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with primary emphasis on furniture, and a strong secondary emphasis on glass, pottery and other small art-objects. There are also a few photos of Art Nouveau buildings. The color plates are decently reproduced for the time (circa 1973), and I don't recall seeing many of these artifacts in other Art Nouveau photo books. All the works illustrated are European.Highlights: a spectacular Dijsselhoff room setting in the Gemeentemuseum, The Hague, and a van de Velde armchair that ""suggests the idea of comfort -- without in fact being comfortable.""The book is readily available and inexpensive, and you should consider it if you're an Art Nouveau fan.Note that Amazon has this book listed in seven(!) places as of this writing, so be sure to search author & title to see all copies currently available.Happy reading--Peter D. Tillman"
3,Art Nouveau in a Nutshell,"With only 64p. of which 14 are actually text you might question whether this book from 1971 is any good. Surprisingly it's quite decent. Not elaborate in anything it manages to strip down the style to very it's basic foundation without becoming superficial.If you want a clear definition of Art Nouveau without reading through bible sized books, this might be a good starting point. There's a bit of architecture but it focuses mostly on interior design. A 100 (very clear) photo's showcase the diversity of the different movements within the Style.If you are familiar with Art Nouveau there is nothing you haven't seen before. But when a book is cheaper then the postage your really can't go wrong. And it's just too cute. Really.Note: there's also a paperback"
3,An Author Bites the Dust,"As always with Upfield, when he takes his main character out of the bush (e.g., Swordfish Reef), things do deteriorate. Still, because the literary establishments of Melbourne and Sydney disliked anyone who wrote for money, the book, a thinly disguised assault based on two real members of Melbourne's intellectual elite, the result is a wonderful blast at intellectual pretensions anywhere. As such it is as much document as novel. Still, it is a good read, but nowhere near the best of his books (he considered Drought his best)"
3,Skewers priests of high literature,"A good read about N. Bonaparte. It harks back to Swordfish Reef.Somewhat typical and formulaic, except that it skewers the custodians who foster and exalt serious literature, protecting it against practitioners of what is deprecated as merely commercial fiction.Did Mr. Upfield feel some animosity toward his artistic ""betters""?"
1,Don't waste your time!,"I was excited to finally see this on DVD...only to have all the excitement drain away when I looked at the DVD. My copy looked like someone had used it as a coaster. It had a ton of scratches on it!!! As soon as I saw that, I knew it probably wouldn't play very well...and it didn't. It was skipping and actually stopped playing where the DVD player said 'Cannot read disk' a couple of times. The quality is also horrible!! It looks like someone used a bad copy of the movie and just transferred it onto a DVD. Sound is bad and picture is very washed out. PLEASE don't waste your money on this! You'll end up doing what I'm about to do...return it!!"
5,great show for those in the know.,I really enjoyed this show. Its not the best quality but if your mining it content you wont care. The segment about the Army having the BF species as protected really says it all for me. It was complete with diagrams and everything. The movies a must have if your researching the subject and want to learn more about it.
5,Get it,"One in a trilogy, the cat fights in this book between Antigone and her sister should keep you interested for the hour it take to read. for a better understanding of Sophocles wisdom, get the whole trilogy."
3,is this too deep?,i think this book is too deep and meaningful.. it enters too deep into the morals and values of man....
5,A few are still available,This book has over 150 photos and nearly 400 Vietnam War Memorials listed from every state in the nation. It is the only book anywhere to give the background information on all of these monuments. ... .
1,mommy of a boy,"One of the worst buys ever. What a disapointment. My husband is in construction, so when my son saw this at the store, he was excited so I got it. First day within a couple of hours, some of the buttons on the remote broke. So, I went back to Toysrus and they replaced it. I brought the second one home and the thing doesn't even move!! Not on carpet, or my hardwood floor. It just vibrates. It's cheap, cheap, cheap. I expected more for the $25 bucks I payed. Definatley don't buy this!"
1,Dont waste your money,"In spite of the other reviews I bought this toy. It was just as bad as everyone said. Cheap plastic, it will not move half the time, it just sits there and humms, then after a few tries it will move forward or back for a little while. That is all it will move though, there is no way to go side to side. They conviently dont mention it is a wired remote. And this all started off badly when I realized the dozer was designed to never be removed from the packaging. There is no way to easily remove the toy without damaging the dozer, it is screwed into plastic holders that are screwed into larger plastic holders that are screwed through the box into a plastic plate which prevents anyone from removing the dozer from the box. I spent more time removing it from the box than playing with it. When I realized you could not turn right or left I was finished. A really cheap toy, poorly thought out and poorly designed. Spend some extra and get a decent toy, not a Cat dozer."
1,Worst ever,The thing was so loud I had to put electricians tape over the speakers to muffle the noise level down to something bearable. Not reccomended.
1,no power and very loud,"The only place you can use this toy is on hardwood floors. I was so dissapointed when my 4 year old got this for his birthday, and it was a piece of junk. He had wanted one for over a year, and I come home with this....don't waste your time!"
2,Don't Buy,"Listen to the other reviews. I did not see any reviews before I bought this at ToyRus. It is cheap and weak. My 4 year old son can move cereal around on our hardwood floors but that's about it, no carpet or outside at all. Spend more for something better. I also agree with other review about getting this thing out of the box, you'd swear there was hidden gold inside or something by hard it is to get this thing out."
4,Well worth the money,"Easy to follow, good recipes and good instructions. Great for the beginning BBQ'er as well!"
4,Big Time Barbecue Cookbook Review,Recommend this to anyone wanting to improve the quality of their barbeque. Outstanding compliment to any cookbook collection.
4,THE REAL THING,THE BOOK IS FULL OF EASY TO UNDERSTAND COOKING TECHNIQUES AND TASTY RECIPES. IT IS ONE OFTHE MOST USER FRIENDLY PUBLICATIONS I HAVE COME ACCROSS.
5,Absolutely THE BEST,"I have been a student of cooking for over 40 years. I have a good collection of cook books. This book is one of the best I have ever bought. The emphasis of course is on BBQ, but what a book. The author is accessible thru E mail. I tease the author that this is the most expensive cookbook that I ever bought, not because of its price, but when people taste the recipes made from it they want to borrow the book. I of course say, ""please let me get you a copy."" I already have bought five copies. Don't pass this one up if you enjoy big time BBQ.Bill Gronke"
4,Great cookbook,I have tried many of the recipes from this book and all have been very good. The tips and techniques that I have picked up out of this book has been well worth the price.
3,your basic tourist course,"Language/30 courses basically teach phrases that you learn like a parrot. If you are a linguist, you will figure out which words mean what and a few ideas of the grammar. This has the advantage of using both men and women speakers, which is esp. important with a tonal language, but has a glossary restricted to the vocabulary in the course. Bottom line: a good way to get used to the sounds and start making them yourself, but if you need to say more than is on the tape or CD you will be out of luck."
4,A good product,I own this and Pimsleur Quick and simple Vietnamese. This is much better than Pimsleur. A lot of bang for the buck.
3,Self Hating Whites are a pain in the . . . .,"Read jessito's review. What is your problem dude? The book is interesting, the lenni lanape are interesting, but your white bashing is a bummer. Just because you have a problem with your own race doesn't mean you need to ""share."" Talk to a shrink.The Delawares are a very interesting people, and their history, particularly their role in the early West of the 1830s and 1840s is not widely known. Its a great book. Ignore Jessitos ""white business"" and read the book. Dave"
2,just ok,"I put this on my wifes Pt. the two back windows are fine, but the front windows hit the visor on the way up. I think a in chanel with tape is the best way to go and wont buy this again."
5,small in size only,don't let this book's small size fool you. It is packed with a lot of prayers and teachings on the souls in purgatory; not for those in a hurry
5,Great in class discussions.,"I have used this play in several undergraduate classes in European Politics. One of its many virtues is that it starts a lot of conversations with students who by their own admission know very little about eastern europe. And yet whenever I have students from eastern europe in the class, they always find many parts of the play deeply authentic. It's getting a bit dated by now (2003), but I still think it's a terrific starting point for discussions about borders, ethnicity, and commerce in contemporary europe."
4,Colorful and bound breaking,"This play reads into the structure of language barriers and breaks into the strife between the eastern and western hemispheres. Though the bracketed english is a bit confusing at times, the play itself is easy to get involved in. It is based around the mystery of who painted a mystery fresco inside of a small church. As the mystery unfolds, so do the characters. The plot keeps the reader inthraled and wondering who will be the greedy one. I recommend this book to all theater majors because of its use of structure and role reversals. It really lends a hand to those looking for a piece about the barriers and definitions between cultures."
4,Good Product,"It took a little while to install. But I noticed a HUGE difference in pickup and how smooth my truck is shifting from each gear. The little whistling sound isn't too annoying as long as you have you music up. Also, I didn't really notice an improvement in MPG. Overall worth it im my opinion."
5,Sounds MEAN!!!,"I purchased this and the airraid throttle body spacer, together they have helped my gas mileage and over all just give me a little boost in acceleration and make my truck sound MEAN!!!"
3,beware f 150 owners,The product works as intended. It does have an annoying whistle at certain rpms that is frustrating. Can't seem to get it to go away. If u have an 04-08 f 150 beware that putting this on will require a programmer or custom tune. It relocates the maf sensor and will make them run lean. This will cause issues. Also product didn't improve mileage at all. A little power and sound. I would do a drop in k&n and something called the gotts mod if I could go back. Just Google it. Way cheaper and better.
1,You better have the time!,"For the first 93 pages, the ""Plan"" sounds pretty good, then we get to the menus!Ironically, just after writing ""Having been an avid reader of diet books for many years, the thing that I found most frustrating was having to ""wade"" through 16 pages of information fo find out what to have for breakfast"", the author does just that. Pages and pages and pages of menus and recipes that only a person who has no job and no life could possibly have time to shop for and prepare week after week.This book was written in 1990 and has, apparently, never been updated and there have certainly been scientific breakthoughs and changes in the last 15 years. Skip this one and get ""Dieting for Dummies""."
1,The Comic,"She said,""I'm just a comic."" It's a shame that people couldn't go along with that. The book would have been an entertaining one with descriptions of jobs, places, people and incidences; but, instead, it stooped to ""fibs"" about Fang (Sherwood) and complaints about family & life that weren't even a part of her talk or life in the earlier, happier days of her career. The negative trend is just too popular and the stars often produce what the audience wants to hear. Her family got really ""banged"" around and they are not that kind of people. She was very elderly, too..."
4,Funny,Bought as a gift. Gift recipient loved it. Usually can't go wrong with anything that has to do with Phyllis Diller. She is a legend.
3,Interesting reading when you have nothing else to read.,"To be perfectly honest, I only got this one because it was a real bargain. But I enjoyed reading Ms. Phyllis Diller's autobiography. I'm not a Diller fan but this funny lady can be an interesting character and an acceptable story-teller. Some parts get to be a little repetitive, particularly on that of her not-so-great husbands. Still this book makes a good reading. And if you are a Phyllis Diller fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy it even more."
4,By a Gutsy Broad,"I enjoyed reading the book very much. She has an interesting story to tell, and tells it well. If you ever saw her on TV you will understand that behind that completely over-the-top character, there lived one really tough broad. I'm glad she made it big. In her performances, she said so much, and spoke the truth through her humor. God Bless!"
4,what a kick,"I have always like Phillis and her antics. I saw the book while searching for an autographed picture or her and purchased it. When it arrived (very quickly I might add) I put down the book I was currently reading and picked it up. Well, 2 days later I was finished with it. I spent a whole rainy weekend enjoying it. I knew her life wasn't all jokes and laughs but had no idea she had such a bumpy ride for a good many years. I highly recommend the book. It's a good read for a winter weekend. I found it hard to put down. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
2,Not what I expected,"Unfortunately this CD was not what I expected.Yes it does feature African Xylophone music, but most of the tracks sound the same and are very raw and unedited."
4,Able Efforts Devoted To A Short Feature Bring Cause For Celebration.,"Despite its brevity, a measured mood is developed during this four minute multiple prizewinning short, perhaps due to a complete lack of dialogue that serves to enhance a surprise ending that delighted audiences at its Toronto Film Festival debut, as well as those who viewed it during its wide distribution to European and Asian theatres. The title is cleverly reflective upon a theme of revenge that would be appropriate for a magazine published fantasy short short story, appreciated by the substantial numbers who saw the work in the Los Angeles area, playing there on the same bills as Tom Tykwer's RUN LOLA RUN. The production for this short is flawlessly accomplished by all involved and especial notice shall be given here to the work of makeup artist Colin Shuler for a highly skillful prosthetic creation."
1,Waste of time and money,"What a disappointment! I'd expect the well-known and respected discus breeder to really share his experience, provide tips, give some helpful info, etc. Instead, we have a poorly translated and unorganized (ala TFH) coffee table book filled with fragmentary biographical memoirs and reiterations.The same photos are repeated over and over again, and the great Dr.Axelrod is pictured and praised on almost every page (what a surprise for a TFH book!).By the end of the book, the author is starting talking about his OBGYN practice and birth control, security at the airports and his years of medical residency. It sounds like he either got completely disoriented or was desperately trying to finish this literary nightmare."
5,Took Me Back to 1970 AND I laughed out loud all weekend,"Not only did I get the first 4 seasons for HALF PRICE, but as I said above, I am THOROUGHLY entertained, and happy with my purchase. I had forgotten $ 7,000 annual salaries, and 26 minute episodes (yes, the show used to rule, NOT the commercials ),not to mention the bonus of mini-skirts. I recommend this Classic show very highly. HI GUYS !"
5,She made it timeless on her own...,"If you would like a refreshing, smart, funny sophisticated alternative to the increasingly grotesque sludge passed off as sitcoms today, you couldn't do much better than the Mary Tyler Moore Show. I have frequently gone back to take a look at television's golden oldies and been shocked at how little satisfaction there was in the dated humor, styles, etc. But this one was different. It's not the only one that stands up to the test of time, of course, (Cosby will always please), but it's right up there at the top. The humor is sophisticated, yet tasteful, and never condescending. Mary and company are so human and so easy to relate to, even thirty years after the fact. I laughed and, sometimes cried, totally involved, as I walked step-by-step through the first four seasons with this wonderful cast (and amazing writers). The best thing about it is that I have three Moore seasons to look forward to, as soon as they box them up."
5,Mary Tyler Moore series (first 4 available),"We thoroughly loved these videos. It was like watching the show when it was first on television. I guess I still love the part where she throws her hat in the air exclaiming ""You're gonna make it after all!!!"" Love it."
2,What...Leftovers Again?,"Imagine you've eaten chicken all month. You are promised something else, and sit down at the table and it's......chicken. Sure it's on a different plate, but chicken again.I heard about the MTM Box Set and thought, ""Yes! About time!"" I have bought each DVD since the Season One was released. I've always wondered what was the holdup, like every other fan. It's such a freakish wonder, why shows like Punky Brewster are released before this classic show. Same goes for Bob Newhart. Where are the remaining seasons for THAT classic???So I find out that the hype is over the same DVDs I already own, just in a box.I give it a few stars for the greatness of the show, but dropped the score for the inexplicable actions. Next time there's a reunion and a ""box set,"" please make it for something new."
5,"Wonderful, wonderful show",My husband and I have been enjoying watching every minute of this show. Mary Tyler Moore is classic! I have several favorite episodes already. They need to HURRY UP and release the last few seasons because I'm almost through with these after just a month!
5,"More Moore, please! Finish the collection!","The MTM Show brings back lots of memories from the past when ""TV sitcoms were funny!"" Reality programming didn't exist in the 70s and thus creative writers were truly appreciated by the viewing public. My TV isn't on much anymore in the evening. Shame."
2,Only a beginning,"Our parent education book group agrees that advice-giving to parents has been complex and inconsistent. However, identifying an ""odd couple"" (experts who give contradictory advice) for each period of the century is arbitrary, contrived, misleading and inappropriate. Hulbert mentions that she selected advice givers who had spoken at national conferences. Otherwise, she give us little information about her biases or about the criteria she used to select individuals highlighted. Why did she choose L. Emmett Holt (not a well-known individual) and G. Stanley Hall (who focused primarily on adolescents)? The protaganist format meant that in the recent years, advice-giving ""giants"" such asThomas Gordon, Hiam Ginott, Jean Piaget, B.F. Skinner, Erik Erikson, and Rudolph Dreikurs barely receive mention. A history book on parent advice IS needed, not only for scholars, but also for parents to understand their own upbringing. This book barely begins to fill the need."
4,Good Show!,One disc had some problems playing but overall not too bad. Love the show. The subtitles were hysterically ineffective. It seemed like a horrible translation from another language. Good for a laugh. But if you don't need the subtitles I would definitely reccomend this item.
3,Great Show!!! Rotten Price!!,"Absolutely love this show and have never missed an episode. Started taping this series when it first came on and have been a fan since. Got a bit sidetracked when my VCR broke and I didn't have the cash for a new one (missed the reruns too) so I missed a couple seasons. Saw this and ALMOST got it.Instead, I bought the seasons indivdually and saved myself a ton of dough. Highly recommend you do the same!! Makes sense since it doesn't come with ANY bonus material you wouldn't get if you bought them individually. So you're not missing anything out."
4,Early Emmet,"These guys are an incredible band. Nothing too flashy but great guys with great hooks. I haven't seen the '99 release, my copy was bought at an Emmet show in 1994 in Chapel Hill, NC. It's not quite as good as Wake or Arlington, but it does feature the studio versions of some real showstoppers like ""Hey Jesse"" and ""Clean Water."" Definitely worth a listen. I think at this point the guys have called it quits, but I'm always looking for a reunion."
1,This product did not work.,"I would not suggest buying this, I put it in my hair... smells awfull, and it doesn't even work. Very disappointed in it, I thought I'd have straight hair or at least slightly straight hair. It did absolutely nothing for me and I followed the instructions as told."
1,Not recommended,This product is horrible. It was a great idea: a straightener that you wouldn't need to spend time doing every single day...one that you would apply and be done with in less than an hour and not have to worry about it for several months. This is not the case. Upon opening the bottle I started gagging over the awful smell. It did not smell like chemicals like you would think. It smelled like cow manure or something along those lines...a toilet maybe. Not only did I have to deal with the smell for 15 minutes it was still there after using shampoo. It also did not straighten my hair at all. I ended up using the electric hair straightener in the morning. I would not recommend wasting your money on this product.
3,Seem To Be A Cost-Effective Replacement,"These fog lamps are okay; mostly plastic just like the GM OEM lights....though wish the lenses were glass.They fit okay. I'd buy these over the ones sold at GM parts counter anyday, if for no other reason than to save about 50 bucks per light."
1,Not worth owning - even if it's free!!,"I got the Bose CD Player ""free"" with the Bose headphones I purchased. I've exchanged the CD player 3 times and the most recent one I got is not worth what I've spent in batteries to keep it going! I can get about an hour and a half on any battery I've tried (and I've tried many!!). There is no included AC adaptor and the (practically useless) manual included with it does not tell you what type of AC adaptor you need to use with it. The CDs skip when doing anything other than walking gently (even in the No Skip mode) - I don't jog, but have tried using it doing yardwork (blowing leaves, raking grass, mowing). The skips are unbearable. I have a really cheap $20 portable CD that I now use with my $400.00 Bose headphones!"
1,"CD Player is 5 stars, but price isn't! RIP-OFF!!","This CD player was made by Bose 4 years ago as a temporary offer with their QC2 headphones. You got a free CD player if you bought the QC2. You could also buy it direct from Bose for $49.99. What makes Amazon or this seller think that after 4 years of this CD player first coming out, and in an age of digital MP3 players, a CD player is worth $300? Not to mention, worth 6 times as much as when it was first released? DO NOT BUY THIS. This CD player is nothing special other than looking nice, and being Bose. It is high quality, but playback is similar to any other quality CD player. If it cost $50 perfect, but $300, never!!!"
5,QUALITY ALWAYS WINS,TESTED AND OWNED MANY BUT THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST EASY TO OPERATE NO COMLICATED KNOBS OR BUTTONS JUST PURE CRISP SOUND THE WAY MUSIC SHOULD BE..................
1,"Quality at it's best, absolutely a 5 star quality product","I was looking for quality headphones to use for traveling (mostly). I can study, listen to music, block out any noises to be able to concentrate and/or block the sound of irritating travelers."
1,Beware: This printer does not print true black,"I got this printer as an promotional item when a friend of mine bought DELL Inspiron notebook printer. He gave this printer to me.Well, I haven't seen color inkjet printer which does not have black ink since HP Deskjet 560 in 1995. This DELL 725 has only three inks; Cyan, Magenta and Yellow. In theory, black can be made if you mix these three colors, but it is only greenish dark grey in reality. That is why almost all color inkjet printers have black ink as well.The printout from this printer is not acceptable at all. Even text are not tolerable. Don't even image to print photo from this printer. The picture looks heavily faded because of faint black."
1,Got it for free and I still feel like I paid too much,I recieved this printer free when I purchased a new computer a few months ago. It is by far the worst printer I have ever used. Like the other reviews mention there is no black ink and the best you can hope for is dark green. I had recieved a free printer from Dell a couple years ago( a Cannon) and it was a great little workhorse that got me through college. In general I think Dell products and even their free offers aren't what they used to be.
1,less than worthless,"I would have bought a real printer that actually printed black if I would have known what this one was like, but I thought that the free printer would actually be worth using until the ink cartridge ran out. Now I need to print something so I will have to go look for a printer that prints black ink. This was a waste of my time, and my energy in bringing it with me while travelling."
1,does not print black AND,"... my customer service rep. at Dell had me send the first printer cartridge in to replace it as defective before telling me, after the second one also did not print black, that the printer would not be able to do so anyway."
1,Shame on Dell!!!!!!!!,"This is the most ridiculous thing i have ever seen. Dell has sent out ""free"" printers that apparently are completely useless. I tried for a very long time to get this printer to print in simple black ink, but come to find out it only prints in ""dark green, close to black."" I spent almost 30 minutes on the Dell support website talking with a tech simply to find this out. I did some more research and apparently they sell Dell 725 Color Ink (Also Prints Black). But this is simply false advertisement, and i'm no lawyer but isn't that a crime??!!! I am very disappointed in Dell spending the time and money making these hopeless/useless printers."
1,This product is terrible,"As the other reviews say, it doesn't print black!!That is ridiculous.The most basic thing, and this printer doesn't even do it.Dell should defintely be ashamed of themselves!"
4,Their Fourth Project,"Despite the information above this was the band's fourth release, which marked the recording debut of the second edition of the band (which had maintained a consistent lineup from 1997 to about 2002). This is a very enjoyable and focused effort.The songs are characteristically strong, though perhaps showing a bit more of Bob Halligan's impeccable pop leanings than some of the earlier studio material. This project is very song driven, with a little less musical abandon than their earlier work (certainly less rollicking than their remarkable live shows, whether earlier or contemporary with this release) and somewhat less of the Celtic elements that marked the first two projects. This may reflect the loss of violinst extraordinaire Gretchen Priest. The rest of the original soloists remain, though the rhythm section had also changed at this point.If you enjoy them, you'll enjoy this."
3,"Pretty pics, not much else","The book is lovely, but it could've been so much better if it had more desciptions of what you're looking at. Instead, it's full of little phrases that may be helpful, but they are also somewhat pithy. I wish I had purchased a couple of magazine subscriptions instead."
3,Contempory Design Only,"This book really only shows contemporary design - if that's what you like, then it's a great book. Just wasn't what I was looking for - I sent it back."
3,nah...,"they styles are too richy, the ""quotes"" are kinda strange, they dont give any ""good"" information havent heard of any of the designers either. its a large book, they did have some good pictures in it, but like i said too fancy."
5,Great Little Hair Dryer,"I have used this model for many years. It doesn't get too hot, and it's size makes it especially easy to manage."
2,"Only ""low"" mode when using 250 volts","The dryer works great, although I would have liked to use it safely at both speeds.Note that (according to the instructions) the dryer switch must be in and remain in the ""low"" operating position when using 250 volts... Too bad!"
1,BEWARE of poor quality camera and poor Kodak support!,"I received this camera as a Christmas gift last year, and the flash stopped working on Christmas day this year. Kodak warranty is 1 year, so they told me it will be $140 to fix it! I can buy a new camera for that. My sister-in-law also owns this camera and had to send it in twice under warranty, and it's never been quite right since then."
3,Good Camera with Issues,Not a complete fan - takes good pictures but it gets hung up sometimes trying to open/close the shutter and just blinks. I pop open the battery door and it quickly resets. Also it seems to try and overcorrect the lighting at times. I had and older LS model for 4+ years that I preferred. Definitely invest in the dock and rechargeable battery.
3,No view finder,"I wish I had researched this camera a little more before I bought it. When I received it I found out it has no view finder, only the screen on the back to view what you are taking a picture of. For younger people who didn't grow up using 35mm range finder and SLR camera's I am sure they won't mind. It does take great pictures and it is easy to use but because there is no view finder I put the camera in the back of my sock drawer and bought a Canon A630 which I really enjoy using."
1,Battery Killer,"The battery is such a big headache. This camera only works when I put in new or freshly recharged batteries. If I'm using the video taping feature, it will quickly start complaining the low battery.If I leave the new batteries in the camera, the camera will not work because of the battery the next time when I try to use it, even it's just the following day.What's really odd: The 'used-up' batteries from this camera are actually usable in my old digital camera. I'm wondering why this one is so demanding?"
2,Not upto the mark !,"I bought this Kodak EasyShare C875 digicam in Nov' 06 from Amazon online. I had very high expectations with this camera but now I' am not entirely pleased with its performance. The pictures are excellent during daylight or outdoor conditions, but in low light or indoor conditions picture quality is not upto the mark. The zoom is good but when you take pictures of long distance scenes, they appear hazy and blurred. The red-eye reduction mode also does not help much. During Video mode their is lots of Camera noise that is also recorded with the video. It gives an impression that recording was done near a seashore. Overall, I feel Kodak should have tested this product thoroughly before launching it. I' am now planning to sell it off and move to Cannon/Sony."
4,Great photos but...,"The camera works great and I can deal with the ""no view finder"" as listed in other reviews. What really drives me nuts is the button to maneuver around the camera. My CX743 was WONDERFUL. This one doesn't advance just one picture but goes back to the beginning or if you want to delete it skips back to the beginning again. The ""scan"" offerings are great, if you can get the advance button to click onto the correct icon--again it skips all around and won't place itself where I want it to do so. I can't tell if it is super sensitive or just the way that it works. This is especially frustrating when you are trying to ""review"" pictures.On the other hand, the cropping and enhancement right on the camera menu are great and do a tremendous job.Hopefully the museum setting will work well. I'm still not satisfied with the night setting for inside churches during choir festivals etc."
2,Camera Came from Amazon Broken,"Well, I did not even had a chance to use it.. When I turned it on it immediatly turned off.. I returned it to AMAZON and I am waiting my refund. I am dissapointed with it..."
3,"OK Camera, if you are ready to adjust the modes","I bought this camera to take pictures of my daughter. And I tried extensively for over 9 days and then returned it.Here is my take,- You can not simply use the auto mode. Believe me. It sucks. I tried over 100 pictures in auto mode in different conditions, the good pictures are less than 15-20.- You can take nice pictures if you know what mode to select bsed on lighting and environment. But it is a hassle. When you try to take shots, you want it to be done quickly. You do not have time to analyze and pick the best mode in 20+ modes.- The loading into computer and zoom are nice.So if you are trying to take pictures mainly of adults and places, it may be a good camera, but not for kids or on the moment shots.Good luck"
4,SCATTERED BUTTONS,"Overall I'm please with the results from the camera. I easily switched from a ""viewfinder"" peraon to display viewer. There is some difficulty with wash-out in bright back light. A hood would help. My main complaint isthe scattered option buttons. The flash, delete, data, menu, and review buttons could have all been combined ina toggle button right next to the current toggle and made fumbling less irritating. As for the remaining buttonsput them on the back in thumb's reach"
2,batteries,The batteries for this product do not seem to hold up. I don't know how it compares with other digital cameras but we are having a hard time getting us to this one.
3,Good Camera,Was a so so camera. Had to send it back to Kodak and they completely rebuilt it for me. Now it works fine and I am happy with it.
4,kodak c875,I already had a C875 and wanted another to make stereo (3D) pictures with. I take 2 pictures at one time and mount them to have a 3-D picure. It works great. It's a little hard on batteries but I already knew that. The purchase of an AC adapter has helped that though when I use it for reviewing pictures etc.
1,would not recommend,"I bought this camera in July of 2007 and practically from day one I was looking for another camera. The majority of my shots were blurry (granted I was taking pix of my kids but still) and low light pictures were HORRIBLE, and forget using the zoom the pictures turned out blurry and out of focus over half the time. I constantly was having to ""touch up"" my photos- I got sick of it and replaced it by Christmas. I used to be a huge Kodak fan until I got this camera. Trust me, there are many, many better ones out there- keep looking! Hope this helps!"
2,"Could be a great camera, but VERY DISAPPOINTING in low light.","This was my third digital camera, and the features, price and other reviews made me curious. The bottom line about this camera is that when shooting indoors and overcast sky, the flash is seriously underpowered. The 5x zoom lens lets you get close, but beyond 8 feet the picture is dark and disappointing.Amazon paid the return shipping, and the credit was smooth, thanks Amazon!"
1,Bad Flash,"After a little over a year of use (warrenty expired) the flash no longer works. Kodak customer service indicates repair will be approximately $150. This camera seems to be little more than a very nice ""disposable"" product."
5,Incredible camera with incredible features that takes incredible pictures!,"I did extensive research before selecting the Kodak EasyShare C875, and I am thrilled with my purchase. This camera takes incredible pictures. The screen is much larger than my friends' cameras, and it has all the extra settings that the average person needs to take great photos in all kinds of conditions. I have not had any bad or blurry pictures with it yet. I am thrilled with this camera and would recommend it to everyone."
1,JUNK!!!,This would be a good camera if it wasn't for it's inability to start on a regular basis and the battery draining issue. Its junk because of too many bugs. Stay away from it.
2,Not what consumer reports made it out to be,I looked at consumer reports and found this camera to be a best buy for your money. I bought it for my mom and she hates it!!! I felt bad giving it as a gift. The batteries never last and there is no viewfinder. The pictures are completely mediocre. I wish I would have spent the extra on a canon. If you love your mothers you'll buy something else.
1,TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLY UNHAPPY!!,"I never received this order, I never heard from the Seller of this order after sending to emails to them. And after recently filing a complaint to Amazon, I've never heard from them yet either."
1,"not good product, not good warranty","The flash suddenly stopped firing and, although the camera is still under warranty, the fees associated with redeeming the warranty can be astronomical. Kodak can find the warranty null and void for any reason, then charge you for the return of your camera. We added up potential costs of turning the camera in for warranty work, and it would be more than a new camera. We're going to give it to the kids to play with and purchase another brand camera for ourselves. I thought Kodaks were supposed to be top quality, but this experience has proven differently. It has been a terrible disappointment."
3,Needs stabilization,"On the plus size the lens is bright, and the controls are intuitive. The cameras form factor is good for both a big and small hands. On the negative side, the camera needs imagize stabilization especially considering how sharp the lens is. I wouldn't buy another camera without stabilization until image sensors become faster (more light sensitive). Most low light situations are a problem with this camera. Another niggling issue is motor noise during video mode. It goes away after the camera gets hot, as if it was improperly lubricated. Unfortunately, the motor noise is captured on video soundtrack."
2,Awful power consumption. Buy something else,"This is an easy-to-use camera we've had for over 6 months and we bought it because it looked like the best camera to snap pictures quickly once you pushed the button, which is important if you have fast-moving kids. However, THE POWER CONSUMPTION IS AWFUL! I've never before had a device that was so inefficient with battery usage and would require so many recharges or new batteries. I think I've replaced the batteries 4 times before I've filled up the memory card. I've nearly thrown this camera out the window various times because the batteries cut out at important (and priceless) times. I'm selling it to get a Canon. If you like having precious moments lost forever because the camera chooses not to work at all when you need it most, then this camera is for you. Otherwise, please get something else."
