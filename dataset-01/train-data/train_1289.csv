4,Good Guidance,It's a very basic book talking about traffic engineering. I would recommend it for students learning transportation engineering or related topics.
3,Fire the editor and double check your math,"This book does a good job of detailing the necessary warrants for various traffic issues but when attempting the problems and reviewing their examples, you become extremely thrown off with all the mistakes in the numbers. I've scribbled my own edits everywhere."
5,What a blessing!,I am very thanful to have read this book. This book is a real eye opener on what is really important in raising your children. Every parent should read this book. What a beautiful book! Thank you Gary for writing this book!!
5,A Gift,"This title intrigues me, and I ended up giving it to my Son and Daughter-in-law as a gift before reading it, so I can't really rate it, but the Author gets rave reviews from a friend of mine."
5,great read,"i have read many of thomas' books, and this one was great. it helped give more of a framework for understanding and thinking about parenting, more than actual ""tips"". it was a good change of pace, and much needed for me."
3,"Works very well for the softer pills, but...","This pill crusher pretty much pulverizes your average tablet. However, when It comes to a certain really hard double-coated pill that I've been unsuccessfully trying to crush with multiple products, it again just barely cracks the surface, even when I tighten the screw full-force. If only the wings on the blue part were significantly longer, and the clear part had similar wings to hold on to, I would probably get enough leverage to crush this pill without drawing blood from my fingers."
1,Broke on 2nd use,"I get this pill crusher and use it twice, and the top cracks in half.... I don't know if it was just my unit or what, but I think it's poorly made."
5,Pill Crusher,This crusher works great! Low price and fast shipping is also a plus. This crushes large pills and makes them easy to get down. I would highly recommend this pill crusher.
1,"doesn't crush them to powder, jus to small chunks","What a waste of 7-$8 because this thing has little teeth but looks just like old one that used to be $5. So they added something to make it useless to make poweder from pills, then upped the price on thir garbage. Look carefully at the product I wouold even go into the store and take them out of the package to make sure they aren't stopped with teeth that supposidly ""obliderate pills"" well what are all these chunks????"
2,crushes well but powder gets stuck in the tip of the cone,"This crusher is easy to use and crushed pills well, but the resultant powder gets stuck in the tip of the cone-shaped well."
1,Broke after second use,I just bought this at a local pharmacy and after using it for the second time it cracked as I was turning the top. I would not recommend this product!
2,THE REAL NAME OF THIS MOVIE IS REVEALED!!!!!!,"THE SHAOLIN BROTHERS! That's the name of this movie! Not to beconfused with Tai Seng Martial Arts Theatre Shaolin Brothers!That's a different and gay movie! Anyways, I would adviseagainst this product only becuz when the people move, it'sreally weird looking! Like speed delay perhaps!? This version,and I know this, is a direct port (bootleg) from Mei Ah'sversion of Shaolin Brothers cuz they both look exactly the sameand we all know that Video Asia is pure garbage! So, now youknow! I sacrificed my life to find out what the ShaolinMagnificent Armour film is really called and I only did this cuzI'm a big fan of Joseph Kuo! So be happy!"
3,A little short and flat as a pancake.,"Does the trick, but it didn't measure out right and it was heavily compressed over more than half of it's length."
5,Blassie is the King of Men,"I enjoyed this book more than Mick Foley's. It is by far the best of the ""wrestling"" books of recent years. Though frequently profane, Blassie shows respect for his business and his peers. He writes (what sounds like) honestly, from his in-ring persona to his less successful family life.The ""old days"" stories are consistently hilarious, from the opening page recounting of a match with Bruno in Jersey to his being cursed out by an older woman in California.Fred also shows a lot of loyalty to the people he's worked with and for throughout the years.As the WWE published books tend to be, it's written in a first person style in a speaking voice that evokes the author. Again, I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
5,An American Original,"Others may use the epithet, but few live it. Classy Freddie Blassie was one who did. In a country where the self-made man can still rise to the top, Blassie was one who went his own way, forging a path for others to follow. Whether as a wrestler or a manager, he entertained millions throughout his career, a special cog in the World Werestling Federation machine."
2,VERY SMALL,This necklace says that it is 16 inches but has no dimensions for the actual pendant. It is extremely small and was not at all what I had expected or hoped for. It is very pretty but needs to have the actual size of the pendant posted for a more accurate description.
3,This is closer to rock than metal....,"This has an 80's rock feel to it. I adore Russell Allen's vocals, and bought this CD solely because he sings on it. ""Hunter's Night"" is my favorite song, a hard-rockin' tune that allows him to belt it out big time. You get a true sense of his range in that song. I do like the CD, I just don't ""love"" it. His work with Symphony X far outweighs this. I considered ordering ""Revenge"" once it hit the States, but I'm not so sure now. I'm a prog metal addict, and this can't be called that at all. If you like rock and roll, just plain and simple, this is fabulous."
1,Buyer Beware of 2011 release,Buyer Beware! 2011 release is a CD-R copy from Amazon.Otherwise I rate this 4 stars. Please see reviews below.
5,Great book!,"i loved this book! i borrowed it from the school library more than a year ago and ever since i'd returned it, i can't find it and i really want to read it again! block's style is so poetic and detailed, i haven't really read her other books, because i'm not really into the short stories about girls with weird names she's written, but the hanged man is great. i love laurel's some-what tragic story, it's interesting to read about such normal seeming people and find out that their lives are more screwed up than my own."
3,The Hanged Man,"The Hanged Man, by Francesca Lia Block, was an overall great book. They, she and her mother, led wild lifestyles and partied a lot. In my opinion, the novel started off slowly. However, it turned otu to be a teriffic book. I recommend this book to everyone."
3,could have,"I love Ms. Block but and isnt there always a but? I hate how she can write about the same things over and over again in each book. Some times I feel like I read all her work in one book and thats it. I wish she'd expand her mind more and touch on different topics. In this one as well as the others she talks about anorexia, oleanders, sugary doughnuts, mermaids, and molestation. This story should be read by teenagers (15 and up) because the sex parts are graphic. I feel like we hardly got to know the narrator (Laurel) well enough. All she did was talk about her father and how her mother is crazy. She meets a man named Jack and they have sex. Her friend Claudia sounded interesting but no character development there. She just does drugs and alot of them. This book is good though if you've never read Ms. Block before. Read this and skip on Primavera and I was a teenage fairy!"
2,Try Other Books First,The Weetzie Bat books and I Was a Teenage Fairy are much better than this. It seems like FL just got lazy and some of the wording is nearly the same as it is in some of her other books. The book is very thin-I have no idea why she decided to cobble together a novela like this. I cannot recommend Dangerous Angels (Weetzie Bat Books) high enough.
1,So desperate,"I really hated this book. As a big fan of fantasy, mysticism, fairy tales, and strange teenage girls I thought for sure I'd love this book. I had read, ""I Was a Teenage Fairy"" and really should have learned my lesson from it.Block's writing is contrived, and boring. I felt very unconnected to the characters in this book, and thought it was excessively dull. These types of books are for suicidal teenagers who feel nothing but ""angst."" It reads like really terrible teenage poetry. And, while I am well aware this book is directed to high school aged kids, I do not recommend it. It seems as though Block tried desperately hard to pour on the angst, I can just smell how dreadfully manufactured this book is.The other thing, this book was quite short. Which is probably a good thing. ..."
4,"A thought provoking, realistic look at teenage life","This book is deeply thought provoking. It's great for group discussion. A group of three of us read this book in 8th grade in a Literature group. People who read this book need to be aware of the mature content because we were quite surprised! This book took alot of discussion for us to fully understand what the author was trying to express. It was a shocking story, but the most shocking of all is when you realize that this book presents real life issues with little exagerrations. As we got through the elements of the plot we noticed that Mrs. Block's use of dreamy fantasies were a release for the main character's boiled up emotions. Although we found The Hanged Man a challenging read, we were glad that we could go back to our group and talk about the different levels of meaning. Despite the initial shock and the challenge of the novel, we learned alot and definately recommend you read it."
3,beautiful words,the words flowed like poetry and were very intriguing. yet it is a very complex book... and i still have to figure out what block is REALLY trying to say. but the the writing alone is enough to enjoy this very mysterious story.
5,Block at her best,"I believe an earlier review commented that they floated through this like a dream, never got too close, like a fog was around it. I understand completely because I felt the same way, except I felt it added to it. I thought Block executed this book masterfully, in a more sophisticated way than any of her other work. Block's beautiful, flowing prose led me around Laurel's universe, not exposing her dark secrets all at once, but giving me glimpses of fragments of her pain that weaved themselves into a dark faerytale by the conclusion. I found the story of Laurel's struggle with her personal demons after the death of her father, her self-destructive friend Claudia, and her bizarre sexual relationship with her pseudo-savior Jack (not to mention the ingenious way this heart-wrenching plot is unravelled by means of the tarot) a dark, mystical, wonderful experience."
4,earth angel,"Block's words flow like honey and wrap themselves around you. By the time you realize you can't escape, you don't want to anyway. This book follows a fragile main character through an oddessy of sex, starvation, and the supernatural. Stunningly human, the girl is also quite celestial, a combination which Block pulls off very well. If you can find this book, by all means, read it"
3,First Block Book,"the hanged man is my first experience reading a block book, and i would have to say that it was a unique one! i would not recommend the book for younger readers. block addresses mature content. laurel, the main character, has many issues in her life. sex, abuse, drugs, and anexoria are some of the problems that she must deal with throughout the book. at times, the writing was very unclear and i was not sure what the author was talking about or where she was going with her words. i do have to agree with others in that the book is dark and very deep. overall, i would have to recommend it to others, just because it is a short read and i feel that it will leave you thinking about life and decisions."
3,bushnell 3-9 riflescope dusk to dawn used.,"as expected it arrived without the adjustment caps,there were 2 slightly deep scratches in the middle area of the scope body, its hard to imagine how that happened during normal mounting procedures. otherwise physically it was in good condition as described in the ad. lenses were clear ao was adjusted and variable power setting worked good.the packaging was good but the scope itself could have been protected just a little better padded. but all is well!."
4,"Hopefully, it remains a great scope.","Only had it for a few weeks, sighted it in on my 22 rifle, used it twice hunting, all is great so far, great light gain thru scope at dusk.The scope is probably more accurate then the gun, which is a Remington Apache nylon 66, a nice semi automatic, which only seems to group within a silver dollar at 30 yards (benched, but not locked in place..used five varieties of common .. all I could buy on my way home from work).I'll be looking for a gun that can hold a tighter group, hopefully a semi automatic, but more then likely a bolt action."
5,impressive-I just placed an order for another one.,I haven't taken it to the gun range yet but I was so impressed when I took it out of the box that I just bought another one to put on my daughters gun. I will review that one after we have taken them to the gun range.
5,This woman can spin a yarn,"Full of thrills, sex, romance, and adventure, Lorenz doesn't miss in this wild and wooly tale of love and murder in the remote state of Alaska. The characters in Midnight Blue Noon come alive on the pages. If you have time for one good read this summer, make it this book. It is a well written engaging mix of suspense, romance and wit with intriguing characters and a tantalizing plot.Lorenz beautifully captures the rugged splendor of Alaska, and her cast of endearing secondary characters and just the right rouch of quirky humor to her splendidly entertaining story. You want to throw a dinner party just so you can invite Uncle Gus and Flicka Red!I am hooked, when it the next one coming out?"
5,"beautiful melodies, brilliant innovative guitarplaying","His melodies are absolutely beautiful. His guitarplaying is emotional and innovative. He draws from blues, jazz and european folkstyles and creates very distinctive personal music. Listen to LISBOA. This guy is a treasure."
4,it's one of the greatest books I've read,"it shows you all you every wanted to know about star wars, millenium falcon, jabba's sail barge and heaps more .I highly recommend this book, and finally, if you ever see it, get it.!"
3,Very Detailed UnlessReallyinto Vehicles May Prefer Dictionar,"Unless You are really, really obsessed with the star wars ships and other vehicles you are probably better off to purchase the visual directory by the same author. The directory has more pages and is more interesting as it looks at all the characters, creatures, weapons and everything else as well as the ships although the ships and vehicles are not in as much detail as the ones in this book.The detail in this book is very extensive, so if you are fascinated by Star Wars vehicles then this is definitely the book for you. If you wanted a broader picture of the whole Star Wars world then get the dictionary instead. If your a huge Star Wars fan then you'll probably want both."
2,The ultimage guide....not that ultimate or complete,"I would not buy this product again nor recommend it to a friend as this book, being only 32 pages, is missing key ships from the movies. It also is missing specs and dimensions of ships. I've seen other cross section books that give facts like crew compliment, beam length, tonnage, etc. Also, how can you make a star wars book from the original movies and not include the Calamari cruiser that Admiral Ackbar commanded."
5,Great book,"This book has some awesome pictures and some unique ideas. I was especially interested in the notion of landing barge supports on the AT-AT, an explanation I have not yet heard of and think is rather neat. The Milennium Falcon plan was a pretty good one, too. The only problems I could find was the writing on the fuel cell in the TIE that said the artist's name and 'wiborg', the latter of which I don't understand and the former of which I was disappointed by. The other problem was the labeling of the TIE fighter's laser cannon as a refueling port. Overall it was an excellent book and I hope he does a sequel with more vehicles and vessels."
1,Proton Torpedoes!,"Proton Torpedoes? Proton Torpedoes? When you called yourselves ""warsies"" I thought o.k. it's just a copying stage when you made the """"Star wars Encyclopedia"""" I got angry but this is too much and if you are going to copy at least copy it right ""Photon Torpedoes"" you know like in star trek or did that never crossed your down-sized minds? you copy things from star trek quicker then a xerox"
4,Mom's gift,"I bought this for my mother, who loved it! She then passed it on to a friend, who also loved it!"
2,Disappointed,"I guess I should have read the review of this 'new release' of an older (2) novel(s).I love Nora Roberts, but she's so much better than this now! I've grown with her over the years and was a little disappointed that I fell for the new cover, thinking a new book. A waste of money for any Nora Roberts fan."
3,Shipping,"The shippment arrived a month after my order had been placed. Maybe it's because I live overseas, but it still is a long time."
4,love Nora Robert's books,I had to buy this book because I lent my kindle to my mom and ran out of books to read. This was another great family story.
2,Making A Difference Doesn't,"I was hoping that this would help me as a parent of a handicapped child, it didn't. Some of the other reviews were right. There is a lot of repetition."
2,two stars,I was hoping for a more useful book. I want ways to work with my kids teachers and what my rights are.
4,chunky wedges,It's hard to find wedges that are comfortable to walk in and that I can use for work. Not hiking obviously! I like the leather sides it's a classier touch than plastic. The price was unbeatable! I am happy with them and can foresee these being a staple of my summer wardrobe for a couple of years.
3,Not as good as I had Hoped,"This was dissapointing for me. The commentary is very good, but the battle scenes were not that great in my opinion. It could be I was spoiled after watching ""The American Civil War: A Union Divided"" which I thought was FAR better"
5,blue and gray DVD movie,"this is a very good DVD and very good film i am a re-enactor for the american civil war, and it has a way to help us learn more of how our ancestors those of us who did have family serviced in the confederacy and the union side.lived and fought and died we can honor them and remember very clearly what america was all about. was freedom. i recommend this to anyone big thank you and very good price and very affordable"
3,NOT the Civil War version of Band of Brothers,"There are several glaring errors made to historical data on the series, such as claiming the Battle of the Wilderness cost over 24,000 Union and 17,000 Confederate losees and Grant was Lee's student at West Point. It's been said to be the Civil War version of Band of Brothers (which is why I bought it) and I have to say no, it's not.It's still very nice to see reenactors do what they love, but it always annoys me that despite them carrying blanks, they are unable to actually point thier guns at the enemy. I don't know if it's a rule against it or not."
3,Spy novel - slow but in-depth about the English traitors,"This was an interesting spy story which goes into depth about one of the three famous English traitors of the '60s, Kim Philby. It describes the search for truth via the eyes of a member of the SIS (British Secret Service) when Philby asks to return home to England from Russia.It is not an exciting book in the sense that it has no action. Basically, the book evolves about a series of interviews that the SIS person has, The reader, through these discussions, slowly begins to understand what is happening. It has some pretty interesting twists and turns.If one wants to go in deeper about what happened in this period, or if one knows something about these spies, then a reader will find the book interesting. Otherwise, for excitement, go elsewhere."
5,Under A Tennessee Moon,The quaility of this video is superb. I was suprised at how much I liked this video. It is a must have for Neil Diamond fans and you will not be sorry that you purchased it.
2,Trombone,They were out of the Trombone we wanted that came with much more accessories. You get what you pay for. I got a $150 Trombone. I could have gotten a used piece of crap off Craig's list so it was definitely better than that!My music teacher said it was as good as any for a first time student. My son likes it and it works well. It is a cool shade of silver!I rated it 2 out of 5 though because it has kind of a toy feel to it. I guess because it is so light and the metal is so thin...Like I said it is doable just not durable!
4,Always,"Important to keep E,B. White's adult collections in circulation, lest he be remembered only fir his children's classics. Dated in spots but still a work of art."
1,pomace?,"I have always understood Pomace olive oil to be the lowest grade, even considered industrial lubricant. I think it is best used on hair, not even sure of that . research befor you ingest this! Not even sure it can be considered lamp oil which is what the lower grades are used for as well....."
3,Pomace Olive Oil,"I was having a very difficult time finding Pomace Olive Oil to use to make soap. I happened to find it on Amazon and was very pleased to purchase it at a reasonable price, and to receive it in a timely manner.Does anyone know where I can purchase Palm Kernal Oil at a reasonable price and not in a commercial amount (like tons)?"
1,Misleading,"I was hopeful the couple of negative reviews i read were wrong. Nope. They weren't. I just received this today and the first thing I look at is the ingredients in the oil. 90% pomace rape oil, 10 % EXTRA VIRGIN olive oil. Not at all what i expected. I do understand the need for the disclaimer on this product but at the same time if i cannot rely on the information in the product description then i am just supposed to take a chance on this?? I will be contacting amazon to see what i can do about it."
1,Not Pomace Oil at all,I received a gallon of canola oil with a label of olive pomace oil. This is fraudulent and a cheat. Never again. Do not buy this product if you want olive oil.
3,Did the job,"These worked most of the time, but came apart while in my daughters' hair a little too often.They can be put back together fine. You get a lot of them for the money."
3,Let's keep it simple!,"The book's good, but nothing new.To be honest I didn't even know Spurs have a firm.Anyway, the guy however ist a real nutter.It's scary that people with this attitude are permitted towalk among us. He should be in jail just for what he's saying.But...it's a fairly interesting book, got to admit that!And Tanner...if you read this...I'm a Kraut!No wonder, huh??? :-)"
4,The Pinata included the pull strings,We were very pleased with the pinata and surprised when it included the pull strings. That always makes it safer for the children.
1,Product Dimensions,"You specified that the product dimensions where 7x5.... which in fact its MUCH less than that, 7x5 its the dimensions of the package where the product comes.... Very misleading, if I would have known that I wouldn't have bought it. You should correct ""Product Dimensions"" for ""Package Dimensions"" so other buyers don't get scam as I did with you. I feel taken advantage from you guys for lying in your post"
1,Early Efforts an Excuse?,"As a longtime Didion fan I was mildly disappointed with this text. It's cumbersome, swishy, and sloppy. It hints at phrases, and the sort of language she eventually uses later in her writing, but this early novel is exactly that...early. It shows promise, and is not entirely without wit, but it's weak and cumbersome plot, it's overwrought prose, and it's harlequin voice were a disappointment given her profound later works."
2,A play on words can lead to errors!,"A PLAY ON WORDS!I bought the lights thinking I was going to mount them flush to my boat trailer frame. When they arrived, I was elated with the chrome and workmanship of the lights. Much to my surprise however, was an accompanying cord, with plug, to be inserted into the back of the lights. After plugging it in to mount on the frame,two things became apparant. 1. The lights would not fit flush because the plug protrudes from the back of it keeping it about a half inch away from the frame. 2. The plug, after being inserted, has an exposed portion of metal that will be eaten up by the saltwater, it will be immersed in at launching. I wish I had more information about the lights before purchasing them. In sum, While anything can be submersible, everything can't be waterproof.............~"
4,great for the price on a .22 AR,"so far so great. I have bad vision that never gets really sharp and I appreciate the reticle in this one for both quick target acquisition and something my ailing eyes can use. Got the scope for my .22 AR and it's perfect for that. I'm still deciding if the scope doesn't quite hold a zero or not. on any given outing I can get the thing dead on accurate at 50yds and then a week or two later I'm shooting a tight group 2"" low. each time I re-zero it holds it for 200-500 shots, it seems to be in the bag that it loses. either way for the price this is a great scope."
4,Sturdy basic scope,Bought this for my grandson's rifle. I wanted something that would be simple to use and take a bit of abuse. Didn't give five stars because there was a small shift in point of impact between no (zero) and high power (4X).
1,Look elsewhere,"I bought 2 of these scopes to use with my Ruger 10/22. I can't find anything good to say about this product. I bought them a couple of months ago, took them out to test and sight, that's when I found the problems. Too late to return.1. On one of the scope the elevation simply doesn't work.2. Tension on the magnification is extremely high. Way, way too high for quick adjustments.3. No mounting rings included.4. Warranty sucks...see other user's review.Worse piece of crap $80 can buy."
2,Lackluster... is there a Ralph's around here?,good looking product with hotglue all over the cover. Nice. came in a box that was partially open and 12x to big with no packing. GREAT!!!
1,Horrible Movie,"I went to see this movie on a Saturday afternoon, thinking it would be a lighthearted romantic comedy. I love Zach Braff on Scrubs and figured the movie would be good as well. In all honesty, I'm not sure why I didn't walk out of the theater. Being in a new relationship, I felt very dis-enchanted by this film and its depiction that relationships are full of flaws and lies. While no one is perfect, I want to believe in love and believe that people can be faithful for a lifetime. This movie made me feel very skeptical and distrusting. Don't spend your money."
1,Please enter a title for your review,"Possibly the most flavorless youth-oriented film ever made. If this movie was intended for a daytime soap audience I'd recuse myself from judging it, but I can only assume it's intended for a younger hipper audience and it completely fails to engage on that basis. The only scenes that have any flavor are those featuring Braff and Bilson, which basically consist of Braff re-enacting his ""ideal quirky girl charms dorky guy"" routine from Garden State, only the dialogue seems even more teenage and neither Braff's character nor the film seems worthy of Bilson's charisma.The other three quarters of the movie sets about defining the supporting characters by their contextless emotional outbursts or sheer banality, which may be a relevent backdrop for Braff's cliched ""isn't there more to life"" soul-searching, but the lack of any distinct personality or perspective in the dialogue makes this movie intolerably dull."
2,Ways To Kill A Relationship,"If you're looking for a romantic movie, do not watch this! It should be called ""How To Ruin A Relationship"" instead of The Last Kiss. This film is about a bunch of seriously stunted young men who have the emotional maturity of a three year old toddler. The women in the film have their feet firmly planted on the ground (except the slutty home wrecker but she can be forgiven because she is 10 years younger and obviously stupid and therefore has a reason to be immature). These wonderful, long suffering women have their hands full with these jerks and you start to hate these women because they must be just as dumb to want to even be in relationships with such stupid men.This was meant to be a clever coming of age, comedic movie however there were no real lessons learnt, there were no real funny moments and I wanted to shut it off after 20 minutes but kept thinking something interesting must happen- it didn't! Avoid it."
1,The Last Kiss,"Billed as smart, witty, sexy... I say WHAT? nothing but a glorified soap opera with endless four letter words.this Zach Braff person wouldnt even be considered a character actor in movies in the past. Homely to the point of being almost freaky. The scenes change so fast you could care less about any of the characters. This movie is typical of the crap that is cranked out of the movie industry these days.Ebert and Roeper gave this movie (2) thumbs up. I think they must have been on crack when they watched it."
2,When Will It All End?,"While this flic is generally entertaining, it fizzles when the misandric undertones become clear. Then it becomes a tired and irritating film, full of clichés. From this perspective, here's the bottom line: Every male character is flawed. Every female character is strong and principled. The male character is unfaithful because (we assume) he is of weak moral character. When the mother character admits to having an affair, somehow it's her husband's fault. Sounds like the silly stuff drilled into our heads since the 80s. Boring. Pass on it."
5,Very Honest and True to Life,"Lets get this straight, ""The Last Kiss"" is not a romantic comedy- actually its far from it. Like ""The Break-Up"" this film is about real modern day relationships. Its about a bunch of very flawed people screwing up their lives and trying to figure everything out. This film is not for everyone because it does hit home on a lot of todays's issuces facing couples. Things get depressing in ""The Last Kiss"" and rightfully so, because whats love without the downfall.A very good film that is getting a bad wrap from viewers who didnt know any better before viewing. If you you like films that make you think about life no matter how dark is may get, this film is for you.Also check out the wonderful soundtrack that is a great companion piece to the film. Some of the songs are great and actually answer some questions you have about the ending. Nice touch.This isnt a 5 star movie, im only giving it 5 to boost the rating. My grade is a 7.5"
4,Charming and witty romp about the complexity of relationships,"Love American style gets another take in this film. By now you probably know the plot line, but really everyone in this film is in one sort of messed up relationship, which is life as we know it. No relationships are perfect, and we all screw things up sometimes, but love finds a way of trimphing in the end, well most of the time. If you have seen ""About Last Night"" and host of other romantic comedies, there is no surprises in this film, but still very entertaining."
2,The Last Kiss,"I am a huge Zach Braff fan, but this movie is definitely a little too serious. The storyline was kind of weak, and it was filled with pornographic images; so be warned if you watch it with friends and get embarrassed a bit. The story is about a guy who's girlfriend is pregnant and his friends' relationships all turn to crap so he takes their advice and doesn't want to feel trapped and meets Kim, a college student. He ends up going to a party with her behind his girlfriends' back, telling her that he's with a friend, Chris. His friend's dad, Izzy's, dies and his girlfriend sees Chris at his house, wondering where Michael (Braff) went. Then all hell breaks loose. Pretty depressing, not a pick-me-up movie. There's a little anticipation at the end, but the last scene kind of sucks. Totally a gamble on whether you'll like it or not. Just overall depressing."
1,Why do film makers make films like this?,"If you feel that you are WAY TOO HAPPY and feel the need to bring yourself down a notch, this is the movie for you. If you are like most people and want to be entertained, pick up something else.In this movie, every character is morally corrupt in one way or another, and you pray for the end of the film. I really don't understand the point of seeing a film that makes you feel worse than when you start watching it. One of the worst aspects of this, is the girlfriend of Zach Braff is a little over the top, and you fear she will miscarriage through the whole film. Zach Braff starts out mildly likable, but not enough that you root for his character. The only reason to root for him is to get the movie to end. Don't worry that is not a spoiler. But how can you spoil something that is already rotten!"
4,this movie is worth it solely for the soundtrack,movie is based of an italian movie...zach braff did a decent job. the soundtrack is really the best part. real depiction of real life relationships. not a pick me up type of movie little more real and dry humor. it's one of my favorites.
4,Oh My Rachel,"I watched mainly for Rachel Bilson who plays the ""other woman"" I dont think any guy could say no to her. The film is not bad. What do you do with a cheating husband? Jenna actually handles it well. I usually dont agree with taking a cheating spouse back, but after what he had to endure (days sleeping on the porch, never left it for anything waiting for her to talk to him) I think she made the right decision. Lord knows that wouldn't work for me. She'd call the cops on me and slap a restraining order on me!"
1,Skip It!,"Do NOT think of this as a ""sequel"" to Garden State as some reviewers suggest. While Garden State was extremely well-done, brilliantly acted emotionally raw, moving, etc., this movie just tanked.While it started off with an interesting and relatable premise: a group of friends in their late 20s - early 30s grappling with growing-up and facing responsibility versus trying to hang on to their youth (ie- having a baby vs. running off in an RV to central america), the characters weren't developed well and the acting was weak. You didn't connect with any of the characters, except perhaps Jacinda Barrett's character (she was the only one with a believable performance). It was impossible to see various connections between characters (ie- what would Rachel Bilson's character want with Zach Braff's character???) and without giving away too much information, the ending was HORRIBLE!Overall, it was extremely disappointing and I would recommend skipping it altogether."
2,Not a Comedy,"Sadly, I think perhaps this movie would have been better received had it not been billed as a romantic comedy. It's not funny at all! It is a rather sad story about fears and dysfunctional relationships - and actually does a fairly decent job at that - but humor or comedy? No way."
1,Terrible dissappointment,I was looking for a movie to get me thinking like Garden State did. This movie is terrible. I barely could make it through the entire 100 some odd minutes. It had shallow writing focused on people giving up on relationships and fighting endlessly. This gives all relationships a bad name. It is definitely worth skipping.
1,"Sucked, that's all.","Well, previous reviewer Ross takes himself a bit too seriously, but I agree with most of his points.This movie was horrible in its portrayal of men..I will never be able to look at Zach Braff the same way again. His character in this movie was unforgivable, loathsome, repulsive, and I can't believe he read the script and took the role. The other guys, same thing, mostly. The attraction on the part of young college girl for Braff's empty jerk--I don't get at all. Jacinda's parents' issues were underdeveloped, to say the least, as were most characters in this. Jacinda had the best role, and did what she could with it, but geez, it was just such a lousy movie. It depressed me. I mean, if you need to prove it to yourself, go ahead and waste the money to rent it, which thankfully was all I put into it. But for the love of humanity, don't buy it. And remember to come back and review it so we all can say I told ya so."
2,Very poorly cast,"Can someone explain to me why Braff's fiance is played by an Australian and her father-in-law to be is played by a Brit if they are supposed to be all-American from Wisconsin? I can totally hear Barrett and Wilkinson's accents, and it was very distracting and made the movie unbelievable."
5,zach braff is a babe.,"i love this movie. It's got somewhat of a slow plot if you're not into cinematography or that sort of stuff. The soundtrack is also wonderful. The movie came to me used, in perfect shape! it was as if it were meant to plopped into my movie collection new from the store :)"
5,Zach Braff... What more do you want?,I saw the orignal Italian version of this movie and I hated it. Everything just seemed to fall flat. I never hated characters so much. I decided to give the remake a chance because I am so enthrawled with Zach Braff. I think when you hear 'Zach Braff' you automatically think 'funny' so people were disappointed with the overall tone of the movie. It isn't a romantic comedy. It is about the complexities of love and realizing that you are no longer a kid. Zach Braff proves he is so versatile and talented in every role. Jacinda Barrett was okay. I think they could have found someone better for this role. It was just easier to sympathize with Braff's character instead. (I heard that Rachel McAdams was considered for this role and I think she would have been amazing.)Anyway this is a great movie but don't expect big laughs. The soundtrack is really good too!
2,Why sell near-expired products in bulk? UPDATE BELOW,"When will I learn? That a heck of a lot to use in just a month or two. I LOVE this bullion, it really is the best, but Amazon has a way of selling huge quantities that expire WAAAAAAY too soon.UPDATE: It looks like Amazon has changed the grocery for the better! I recieved another near expired item, and called to complain. Instead of the previous yawn on the other end of the line, I was apologized to and given a fresh product! YAY AMAZON!"
2,I agree with Shannie,"Great product, but Amazon sells this stuff in huge quantities too close to expiration.It's not saving if you've got to throw 2/3 of it away!"
4,One of the first train Blu-rays,"Cover art is a joke. Looks like it was put together by third graders with an old, old copy machine. They could have explained more about the technical aspects of the locomotive. Most of the video is first rate, but they could have added a lot more infomation about this train."
3,geometry review,"this book is good regarding quantitative and if you are going to derive formulas. This book does not go to depths in the two-column format thats why I gave this book 3 stars, but the book all in all provides critical thinking, for example finding the areas of triquetras, gothic arches, areas of triangular and circular glass windows. This book is challenging in nature and very applicaple and theoretical they go hand-in-hand."
2,"Disappointing, incoherent documentary","Surely someone could make a very interesting documentary about Norwegian black metal. But this movie falls far short. There is no rhyme or reason to the sequence of scenes in the movie -- it's an incoherent, slow-paced mess. The film-makers did not make any attempt at organizing the information into some kind of coherent story. I struggled to finish watching the movie. Part of the problem lies with Gylve ""Fenriz"" Nagell, who is the main subject of the movie. The man is inarticulate and, frankly, not very bright. Much of what he says doesn't make any sense.My advice is to skip this movie, unless you are a die-hard fan of Norwegian black metal."
2,'Until the Light Takes Us' wasn't that great,"Would make a great documentary if you're highly interested in Metal and the drama surrounding it, but if you aren't a big fan of the genre I would say pass by this documentary without a second glance. The camera work was shoddy, the interviews were short (with poor responses, to boot), and the audience is given very limited perspective outside of a single band's view of Metal and the heritage which inspired it.Again, this would probably appeal much more to fans of the genre. People interested in the culture may not gleam as much from the film, however."
3,A GOOD READ,"I really enjoyed Daniel Baptiste's book.It revealed the reality of the mindset of so many young black men/boys in urban America.Although the language was sometimes harsh and some of the jargon took me a while to figure out, I learned a lot from this book about how young men are easily attracted to the world of selling drugs and how it ends in deception and destruction."
2,dreams cracked,"Follow the young men, who turned to the streets just for quick money and new clothes for school and turned into the Bronx nightmare.This is the authors first try at a novel, being on Zane's label, I was expecting a little more action and when the action began it ended just as quick as it came. The book was to long, although it was only two hundred and something pages and went into detail about every little event, from the street store location to what was written on a banner. This book was not a book that I would pick up and read agian. I say beter luck with your next book."
1,"Hard to Follow, Difficult to Understand, Terminology Warped","Out of all the books I have been required to read in pursuit of my PhD, this by far is the worst book I owned. Its very difficult to follow at times, and the author places these ""exercises"" within each chapter in attempt to enhance the understanding of the material. In actuality, its cumbersome and often times not relevant to the material previously presented. I could write a full review of how bad this text is, but as with the other recommendations, I would stay away from this text."
1,Horribly edited,"This is NOT a very good book. It is very basic, and at that, it can't get it right. The book is very poorly edited, which causes a lot of confusion."
2,Not what I expected,"From the title of the collection, you might expect that it is an intelligent look at people with superpowers, right? Or perhaps, they are exceptional in some interesting way that fits in with the ""superman"" or Nietzsche?Nope. They are stories about beings who have been altered past normal humanity. This could be interesting, although it would have been nice to have had a clearer description indicating that this is the theme of the stories. However, the stories themselves are not real winners.It's not a bad book, but it is far from the Dozois' best work as an anthologist."
2,Not the best sci-fi I've read,"I used this book primarily as an introduction to science fiction, and found it quite discouraging. After reading other science fiction stories, I found that the selections in this book were not the best available options. Many of the pieces were frustratingly confusing. If beginning in Sci-Fi, I recommend you look elsewhere, and return to this once you have mastered the genre. For experts of sci-fi, this might be better.Word_Ninja"
3,Black Tourmaline Necklace,"Nice piece, but most of the necklace was not black. Still an attractive piece, though!"
1,Very untruthful material,"The purpose of this book is for Mr. LaPierre to make as much money as he can from ignorant Americans who tend to believe him. The amount of untruthful material in here is just plain amazing! If the reader takes just three minutes to Google the UN conference on small arms and light weapons, he/she would find that no UN body has ever contemplated regulating legal sale and posession of small weapons in any of its member states. However, their main goal is eradicating illicit (i.e. illegal) trafficking. If Mr. LaPierre so vigourously opposes UN in this effort, it clearly means that his organisation supports smuggling and illegal sale of guns.This book is most likely going to be preaching to the choir. Other than really uneducated and disinterested readers, nobody else is going to buy the misinformation it is trying to present as fact."
4,A must read even if you're anti-gun!,"I just got the book so I'm not finished reading it yet but I find it very scary. The text is so thorough and extensive (it is well footnoted) that it can be tedious to read but make the effort, no matter what you personally think about civilian ownership of any sort of firearms.The details of UN actions and methods can make even a gun hater wonder if we still need to be in the UN. Continuous patterns of abuse and non-action ( much of that even reported in the mainstream media), policies set up by member states that have no love for any American make this a very scary book.The United Nations used to be a great thing, it's still a great idea, but the mess we've got now no one who loves freedom needs it. The kind of people running that show?, once they get the guns (if they do) the press and the internet will come soon after."
5,holy Cr&*,"If you own any type of firearm, if you want to continue to own any type of firearm, you really need to read this book. You need to join the NRA and any state and local firearms groups near you."
3,Worth a thought,"Even if Nostradamus was right 10% of the time, and he was right more often than that, it'd be worth a minute in thought. Reading about him is not a waste of time, I'd recommend any bright mind to read this book, but also to exercise reason while doing so.I'd be easier to read a more simplified version if you just wanna get a basic story of Nostradamus, but if you are a serious scholar - this is a good refference book"
2,Not what I expected..,I bought this book for my grandfather because he is fascinated with Nostradamus. The only problem is you can't make sense of the prophecies! There's the original language he wrote them in and a literal translation. There's no interpretation to help you understand what the prophecies mean. I wish I would have known the prophecies were not explained and easy to understand. You'd have to be a historian to understand them.
2,This CD is Ok,"This CD is ok, just not great. There are some good songs on here, but some don't sound right - like they're not the real song."
1,Very inaccurate model,"IIRC, this kit first appeared in 1961. It appears to be a modification of Revells HMS Bounty kit, which makes it quite inaccurate. For example, the Beagle did not have a blunt merchantman-like hull shape like the Bounty.Posters on ship modeling internet forums lambaste this kit as one of Revell's most inaccurate models. People say it is like taking a model of a Ford Pickup, changing the markings, color, and box art, and calling it a Chevy El Camino."
3,Flawed but fun.,"I concur with the other reviewer. This model was cobbled together from other ship models and does not reflect any real accuracy. The parts do not match up nicely (gaps,etc.)and there are a lot of gate and flash problems to clean up. The only redeeming factor is the rigging (my favorite part of ship building). I wrote this off as a practice model and did not put near the effort into it that I normally would. Despite its defects, this was actually quite fun to build and the finished model looks good enough to display."
3,Not Durable,"I loved the design and perpetual calender function. The indigo light is cool too. I dropped it one from less than 1m height and it has stopped working, the second hand goes on and off. Tempted to get another but worried about durability as I drop my watches quite often."
4,SIR-T351 Great Picture - Great Price,"I bought my SIR-T351 on eBay for under $200.READ THE DIRECTIONS. You get no signal and no picture until the unit is set up.I am about five miles from digital towers in my area. Locks in on channels almost instantaneously. Two stations (ABC and CBS) are at light bulb status (<100watts). CBS comes in with 4 bars and is solid, ABC has one blinking bar and will not lock in. NFL football in HD off FOX is beautiful.I believe people who are having troubles with this unit are:1. Not properly setting up the set, or2. Not realizing that 90% of digital reception problems are antenna related (multipath, etc.), or3. blaming the receiver when the station is at fault. Digital broadcasting is a difficult and precise art that most stations are not capable of doing perfectly."
1,Samsung - not ready for prime time,"I had two SIR T-150's die on me (just over a year each).I bought the newer SIR T-351. Out of the box, it had a badright audio channel and one bad RGB channel, so it has to beshipped to their service facility. They have only one suchfacility in the US. Last time, the turnaround took almostthree weeks.Samsung is trying very hard to become a major player in theconsumer electronics market, and I am quite satisfied withmy Samsung LCD computer monitor. But my experience withthe Samsung set top boxes will lead me to avoid their phones,TV's, and other Samsung products. Motorola has just begunto ship an HDTV set top box (HDT101), and it can't possiblybe as poor as this Samsung product.Caveat emptor."
1,"Inconvenient, flawed HDTV receiver","All HDTV recievers deliver a superior picture, by definition. Although this receiver is equipped with plenty and good features, the performance is bogged down by a slow interface and faulty sound output.Audio output starts stuttering in Dolby 5.1 regardless of the quality of reception (optical or analog output). Automatic scanning to memorize channels is slow and takes minutes to complete. Channels cannot be added to memory, unless the digital TV station is actually broadcasting. Re-scanning erases all previous stored channels. I do not recommend this unit, unless Samsung fixes these problems"
1,Dead on Arrival,"Like others reviews, I got a new unit that had no signal strength even though I have a roof mounted, $100 antenna that works great for analog and other HD receivers.I'm going on 3 weeks now waiting for repair/replace. Not Good.Clearly this model has issues."
1,Digital audio outputs defective,"Even with a signal strength of 9 (out of 10) on most channels, all I got was a bunch of garbled junk when the unit was set to dolby digital. I tried both the optical and coaxial outputs and had the same results."
1,dead out of the box,"It's hard to review a product that you could not get to function out of the box. Plugged in, attached antenna (good one, outdoor on rotor) yet no reception (no green light) and no output at all through my Sony XBR's DVI connector.Disconnected the Samsung, reconnected aerial to TV, normal reception was fine.Note...this was a display unit, came with a remote that was not the correct remote for this unit. (salesperson error at Best Buy).My sense is the sales folks still don't have much knowledge about HDTV and especially terrestrial HDTV reception.Samsung....it would be nice if the product would at least function out of box. Then I could evaluate performance."
2,Questions for who?,"This is billed as a film about the Dalai Lama, but I think he only gets roughly 5 or 10 minutes of its entire length. The rest of the time, the film is being poorly narrorated by its writer/director. It seems as though the questions he wrote were intended more to capture his personal musings on film than to hear the answers of the Dalai Lama. I didn't even find the questions that enlightening. In the end, it seems to be more about the film director than about the Dalai Lama, which is a shame because the latter is such a fascinating human being and the latter, at least by comparison, not so much. It gets two stars for when the Dalai Lama actually does get a chance to speak and for some of the beautiful scenery it depicts. Also has a little information on the history of Tibet, but less than you'd find in five minutes on Wikipedia."
2,Not up to comparison with Pilcher and Binchy,"I have to disagree with the editorial reviewer. I read this book because it was compared to Rosamunde Pilcher and Maeve Binchy. It's not up to the level of either of these great writers. Fans of Pilcher's ""Coming Home"" will recognize some similarities, probably because Bacon was trying to write something similar. But unlike ""Coming Home,"" the characters are not well enough developed that we care about them, so when terrible things happen to them, it seems excessive rather than tragic. It lacks the richness and depth of other, better war novels. Not terrible, but disappointing."
5,Good Eye Relief,"It say's 6"" eye relief,but it is more like 10"",great for a big bore short range gun like my .444,and groups tight even at 100 yards 3""-5""."
4,Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 1.75 - 4x32 Shotgun Riflescope,Great scope from Amazon and a good price. I put this on my shotgun and hit bulls eye at 1000 yds which I couldn't do before. The eye relief is short so watch out for recoil it can pop your eye on a shotgun. Great scope.
1,Euro-Style laminate trimmer bit,"I bought the Whiteside WS2640 trimmer blade with the Euro square bearing. I thought the square bearing was a great idea, but it was made out of rubber or plastic, rather than metal, and it wore out (broke and flew off)in about 5 minutes. I think I'll just use the old-fashioned round ones from now on."
2,If you need info on Tax Deeds don't bother,"This book talks mostly about Tax Liens, not Tax Deeds. Also because each state is different it is very general. If you know nothing and I mean nothing about Tax Liens, it might be worth buying, but you can research it yourself by calling the assessor/tax collector in your area and then searching county records. You'll find you will have to do most of the leg-work yourself anyway, the book even tells you this!"
1,horrible,This rambling book contains very little true information. I kept asking myself why I was continuing to read it. You will learn more by just going to a tax lien sale and watching how it goes.
5,Best Value in a complete self study program,"This book along with volume 2 gave me far more information than I have been able to get anyplace else, including from all those infomercial and seminar packages. I've used the books to learn how to purchase tax deed property right here in AZ and look forward to going to Nevada. The two volume set even came with a one hour free phone consultation! that's how I learned the even though AZ is a lien state I could buy deed property. Ms. Villanova's books are worth every penny and then some!"
2,Poetry not for the people,"Cryptic, unnecessarily mysterious. This is the kind of work that turns people off from poetry. I tried to get something from the poems, but mainly I got a headache. There was one poem about Jesus I liked and that was it.I think this is the product of MFA programs. The thinking is that if you don't have something to say, craft it as well as you can, and then it will look like you have something to say."
4,As It Should Be.......,"Product arrived in a reasonable amount of time, I was billed correctly. Good service."
5,Very Emotional and Interesting,"This was the first Patricia Haley book that I have ever picked up. She was wonderful. I could not put it down to save my life. The characters were remarkable, I really enjoyed ""No Regrets"". I cried alot throughout the book. I thought I was finished with the Kleenex box , then in the end Karen's friend Connie died. And the Love Letter that Connie had left for her husband Tyrone to read about how much she loved and cared for him, I just could not hold back the tears. I will definitely read the other books by Patricia Haley. you go girl"
2,I REGRET Buying This Book,"This story is so depressing and has been told over, and, over and over again. No originality. The dialogue is bland and boring and it takes several chapters to get entertainment from the storyline. I found myself having to flip in between chapters just to find out what was going to happen because I was afraid I couldn't finish reading it... They have no ooomph! No true spirituality...."
3,Small backpack,"This backpack is smaller than expected as it claims 40 +10. Otherwise, it is a nice daypack for hiking with room for hydration reservior."
3,APC Ford Racing Shoulder Pad,"Image didn't match the description. The description was APC 121130S Yellow Ford Racing Shoulder Pad (this was delivered). However, the image was presented as a bronze yellow with different material. The product still does the job but was misrepresented with the image."
4,Pretty good,"It is a pretty good follow up to the first book. Even if you don't have the first book, you can enjoy the second."
3,Interesting culture!,"...but not revelatory of my own family's experience of Mennonite life. However, although my forebears also came through the Russian experience, their culture may have greatly changed after immigration to Canada and the U.S.Much of the culture described in relation to food was surprising to me and different from my own."
3,A Lackluster Execution of an Intriguing Premise,"While the philosophical implications of a talisman that incrementally depletes the life-force with each wish granted are conceptually fascinating, the novel suffers from both the absence of character development and a weak plotline.Moreover, Balzac's mind-numbingly long descriptive passages are self-indulgent, do little to advance the story, and ultimately undermine its dramatic potential -- probably the most frustrating aspect overall.The psychological and moral themes underpinning the book are brilliantly articulated in Balzac's later works, such as Pere Goriot, Cousin Bette, Lost Illusions, and A Harlot High and Low. Start with these, as only an ardent Balzac fan would appreciate this earlier book.Hunt delivers an excellent translation that captures Balzac's shrewd observations of human behavior and irony. However, the razor-sharp social criticism that is so pervasive in Balzac's other novels is in short supply."
2,Ordered (silver) and they sent a black one just in time for xmas,Yes! I pacificly ordered a Bushnell Trophy 2-6x32 Handgun Riflescope (silver) from optic sales through amazon. Much to my dismay I recieved the black one. What the uck kind of buisness you all running?
3,this wasnt for me but my step dad,he loves these movie I dont but that is ok this would not be for me I buy newer movies
3,Not what I expected...,Was a little disappointed. I'm interestedin fruit carving and this book was more of a children's book. Would not recommend if interested in fruit carving but will recommend if you want your young one to eat his or her fruits and veggies.
5,Five fantastic books in one - a treat for your eyes!,"This book has 5 books inside this one awesome book! There are Shapes, Colors, Numbers 1 - 10, Opposites and letters of the Alphabet. The great book has kept my daughters attention from a toddler to even now as a 1st grader! The books table of contents shows a mushroom table with a bowl some kind of food.I'd have loved to see Joost Eiffers when he first saw whatever inspired him to make his first vegetable or fruit creation! Who'd have thought that a black eye pea would make an eye and tomatoes would make adorable chubby red hippo! Terrific book for young toddlers to teach the the basics of counting, colors, letters of the alphabet and opposites. And also what kinds of food was used and what kinds of food is in their home that is also in this book. My daughter's favorites are the mushroom man and I like the monkey hanging on a mint branch. Great gift!!"
5,My boys love this book,I had a couple of the Saxton Freymann books hanging around the house from my teaching days (Dog Food and How Are You Peeling). My 4 year old twins found them one day and loved them. I ordered them Food for Thought for Christmas last year and it is still a highly requested bedtime book. I love looking at the pictures as much as they do! It is amazing how they accomplish this using only food items.
5,Best gift ever!,This is hilarious and such fun to read. I gave it to my father and brother for their birthdays (same day!) Both talked about it all DAY! It's the perefct gift and so very clever.
3,Weak.,"The premise of this book is the following:Step 1: Make up tons of portmanteaux.Step 2: ???Step 3: Comedy gold!I don't know about anyone else, but this seems a weak foundation, and I did not find the execution particularly amusing.On the other hand, I adore the design and typography. That alone yields three stars, because I am an obsessive sthete."
3,cheap watch,"I bought this watch to weat to work, where I don't care about banging it around or scratching it up. I just need the time and no other bells or wistles. The space where the date is displayed was broken when I got it, so you can't tell the month. Just need the time. The best thing about it is the strap. I really like the fast wrap velcro strap. Also, the light hardly works at all."
3,"OK Songs, but Bad Production","Erika Hoffman has a great singing voice and the songs have strange lyrics kind of like the band His Name Is Alive, but the album is marred by a mix which emphasizes the guitars, the guitar effects, and analog synths too much, leaving the vocals almost inaudible. There are a few songs which seemed to escape this treatment and sound good, such as ""Sunday Man"" and ""Poinsettia."" Unfortunately, the songs lack any raw energy which would make up for bad production, and as a whole the album is merely an interesting first effort."
2,Warn did the production on this???,"TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE is Godzuki's first release and shows a great deal of promise. Sadly, the production is murky and noisy, which is very ironic, considering that the great Warren Defever (of His Name is Alive) produced it. Lead singer Erika Hoffman has got an especially clear and beautiful voice, as anyone who has heard HNIA's songs ""The Bees"" or ""Can't Always be Loved"" can attest, but on this album her voice is buried under noisily-mixed guitars and drums.Godzuki's got interesting songwriting talent (the lyrics are about as surreal as can be) and a quirky and novel science-rock style, but the album is ruined by the production. I give TRAIL OF THE LONESOME PINE two stars, because Godzuki is a good band, but no more because the album often is on the verge of being unlistenable."
4,Pokemon Advanced Battle,"This is great! Finally, Pokemon Advanced Battle is on DVD! This is a great DVD because it has the first of 2 episodes with Groudon and Kyogre, the second on another DVD. If it had both then this would be even better, but that's in volume 2, The Scuffle of Legends. You'll love this DVD."
1,False Advertising by Amazon,"If you will notice on the Amazon website:""Language: English, Japanese""Oops, DVD actually has no Japanese!!Thought it was too good to be true and it was. Zero stars as far as I'm concerned for false advertising. My apologies to Goodwill Bookworks as it is obvious to me now that the mistake is in Amazon's database."
4,C.S. Lewis Tribute,Somewhat disappointed in this DVD of Lewis's life. Never knew that there are no Known images of him on film. Great man and I love all of his books except the sci-fi series.
3,Review of the Life and Faith of C.S. Lewis,"Interesting, but not exactly the quality of documentary that I would have supposed. All the persons interviewed were not identified nor their relationships to Lewis. I did appreciate the director's explanation of why there is so little visual documentation/photographs of Lewis."
5,easy to install,just as described and easy to install- even for a rookie. good instructions included. just turn off breaker and use socket tester to be extra cautious
4,We got what we expected,"Hard to find these types of fixtures, but we were replacing one that had the same plug and it was a necessity in the room. Happy with the purchase"
5,Westinghouse lights #66402 5 1/4 width with outlet,The lights I purchased with outlets where just the right thing for my up stair bathroom with no outlets.. I installed the lights one on each side of the mirror.. Works Great for us. Thanks Amazon!!
4,Nearly Perfect,"This DVD set arrived quickly and was not bent or damaged at all. The case is better than other Inuyasha DVD sets I've picked up. It's artsy and the episodes are listed on each sleeve of its matching disk.The biggest downfall definitely has to be the English subtitles. Who knows why, but they've been deliberately composed to say anything BUT what is actually being said by the characters on screen. You'll probably want to turn off the subtitles every time you put the disk in. It's super annoying!"
5,Inuyasha Rocks!!!,"inuyasha is more than just a story it really has a great deal of charactors that come together. a jelous love triangle of inuyasha, kikyo and kagome, and to many traps and foes, inuyasha shows that fighting, love and courage congures all.!!! making friands along the way and keeping your head held high!pick up your inuyasha box sets today and start the collection.!!! i promis when you see this anime you will become addicted!"
5,X-Mas,This product was a x/mas gift for my child. The package arrived on schedule and intact. This product met all expectations
4,InuYasha Season 3,"InuYasha is a very long series, which keeps you sitting and watching this beautiful animation. The plot line stays intact somewhat in this series. It was an Good series, yet I for one would've liked to seen the plot move a litte. More adventures, and funny actions of InuYasha and the others. This season was packed with a few heart-pounding episodes of battle, and some with a tint of sadness. The first few InuYasha episodes of the whole series seems to suck many into the vortex of InuYasha and the others. After getting my own peices Shikon No Tama'(Sacred Jewel Shards) I finally noticed that these shards have a meaning, yet they aren't real. The dvd's are packed with alot of episodes, which allows you to watch more.I can't wait to see Season Three Of InuYasha!I give season 3 4/5 stars!"
5,An early REM fan says his peace,"The last five tracks of this album are the best songs that REM has ever recorded, barring any argument with Murmur fans, of which I am one. I first heard ""Radio Free Europe"" as a child, and instantly became hooked by their jangly, southern-twangy guitar style, which was very progressive at that time. I'm of the opinion that they turned rock upside-down at that point, integrating a country-style rock-and-roll with a punk-ish beat (thanks Bill B.). Why M. Stipe and friends felt that they had to progress toward the muddy, pop-nonsense sound of Monster and beyond is, well, beyond me. This band has produced nothing but crap starting with Monster, and I can't recommend anything beyond the first six albums. Call me a bitter fan, but I feel a bit betrayed. You be the judge."
4,Rummage Sale,"Dead Letter Office is a combination of outtakes, covers and the band's EP Chronic Town. It's got some good stuff like their three Velvet Underground covers ""There She Goes"", ""Pale Blue Eyes"" and ""Femme Fatale"" and originals like ""Crazy"", ""Burning Down"" and ""Ages Of You"". It's also got some forgettable stuff like ""Windout"", ""Bandwagon"", ""Burning Hell"" and ""Rotary Ten"". Some of the songs are not that great, but are lot of fun like their cover of ""King Of The Road"". The album wasn't put out to achieve any musical greatness, but as a gift to their fans. It shows the band, warts and all. The album is also worth buying for Peter Buck's liner notes alone. He goes through each song and his narrative is hilarious and razor sharp."
5,Not Reject Songs,"This is what one reviewer said...I disagree totally!""Very aptly titled, `DEAD LETTER OFFICE' contains mainly the `reject' songs, which couldn't make it to R.E.M.'s regular albums. From the pre-`DOCUMENT' days, the songs in this album indeed reflect that side of R.E.M.'s, which one should very well stay away from.""Songs like ""The Voice of Harold"" are priceless...many over gems on this one!!!"
4,A great collection of 80's leftovers.,"I was gonna say that this isn't an essential album to own, but that depends on what kind of fan you are. A casual fan may want to pass on this, but any real fan of their 80's work should really give it a listen. True it's not all wonderful, but there's enough good stuff here to get it. If nothing else, it's cool to hear them drop some covers of ""Aerosmith"", ""Roger Miller"", and a few from ""Velvet Underground"". Also, possibly the main reason to get ""Dead Letter Office"" is for the inclusion of the ""Chronic Town"" EP, which is the last 5 tracks on here. Thoses easily hold up to their best work of that era. Their special edition of the ""In Time"" collection has some great extras too."
3,3 1/2 Stars,"The first collection of outtakes combined with the first EP while the band was moving from I.R.S. to Warner Bros. ""Chronic Town"" is a good collection of early jangle, but it doesn't really prepare one for one of the greatest debut albums of all time that was to come next.""Dead Letter Office"" has some really great moments (""Voice Of Harold"" is not to be missed under any circumstances) and it's very interesting to hear the band try it's hand at different musical styles.Of course, R.E.M.'s closet cleaning ranks higher than many bands normal releases. It's a very worthwhile purchase for the fan of the early stuff while those who came in on the more well known stuff will probably be baffled by it."
4,just what I needed to hear lately,"Voice of Harold: it's real, they mean it.I remember lines like that, it much more comes creeping over me when I listen to my old stuff. I wanted to like something new and different back when I started listening to R.E.M. and now I think this was their good stuff. The music was phenomenal, even if a point seemed like interpreting some pain."
3,Chronic Town and a bunch of junk,"Chronic Town (IMHO) was stronger than the Murmur/Reckoning REM, and I played the vinyl to death. It's a pity they added such a bunch of junk to it - but the EP still ranks with their best."
3,A REALLY mixed bag,"I am pretty much going to echo what most people here have already said - this album is necessary solely for the last 5 tracks (i.e. The Chronic EP), which are just as good as anything off ""Murmur"" and ""Reckoning"". The wonderfully catchy jangly guitar-pop we all know and love is in full force on these 5 songs. The remaining 15 tracks are purely for completists and re-confirm the fact that R.E.M. are definitely an album band, and they truly put the best songs on their albums. The first 4 songs and ""Ages of You"" are the onky non-Chronic tracks that are any good. ""Burning Hell"" may be the worst thing these guys ever recorded, and the Velvet Underground and Aerosmith and Roger Miller covers are mostly bland and lifeless. I usually have to skip through too many tracks to get to the good stuff, so I cannot give this a high review, but definitely get the songs from The Chronic EP however you can if you are an R.E.M. fan."
5,Moog Rear Track Bar,I have been using Moog for years. If I have a choice I will always choose Moog. They have always made a quality product and I much rather pay the higher price for a the quality difference.
2,stainless steel scrubbing pad,"This is probably a good product - however, it was not suitable for my needs - to large and course. thanx"
5,Superb!,"Great music by a fantastic group of musicians. A wide range of songs - passionate, energetic, thoughtful, slow and fast - all sharing an amazing passion for the music and an absolute technical mastery of their instruments. I had this on vinyl back when it came out, and was delighted to see it on CD. If I had only 20 CD's in my collection, this would be one. Every song is great."
3,"Music is great, product not so good.","This item has to be burned/made from a master. Amazon folks screwed up the burning and left tracks off of the version sent to me.Music (that's there) is excellent, but not all the tracks made the CD.Getting what you order is usually good from Amazon, but a crap-shoot if they have to make your product."
2,Great up until the end.,"This book hooked me and kept me reading until the end. Although it was well written, intelligent and insightful I found the ending to be a real downer. It was just too depressing for my tastes."
3,World Pro Croquet Set,the set I received is extremely heavy. not a good choice for children or smaller built people. the mallets are very solid and boxy with long handles making play awkward for anyone under 65 iches tall. the directions and rules are fairly straight forward.
2,The publishers need to try harder,"Poorly edited (multiple mistakes regarding very specific names and places), bad use of poorly focused black and white snapshots, not written well. Simply a bad summary of better books. I wish I would have read the books the author of this text summarized. And then wrote this book, b/c I couldn't have done any worse!"
1,got to get it first,i'm sure we will love this when we recieve it. but as of today it has not arrived. should have been in my mail by now.
5,From the front lines...,"I actually saw the Lords more than 20 times live in LA from Magic Mountain to the Music Machine and got the rare opportunity to visit Stiv in the recording studio while doing ""Have Love will Travel"". Believe me that he would be rolling over in his French grave being labelled ""Goth"", whatever that may mean to some. The Lords were a great ""Rock'n'Roll"" band born out of the roots of the punk rock scene here in LA. They were fun, irreverent and fantastic to watch live. Their first album was born of Stiv's desire to move on to a band that could capture the imagination like the Dead Boys had previously. His tongue was firmly planted in his cheek and his hand in his pants."
3,a nicely underrated goth album -- 3 or 4 stars.,"for those who claim this is not a goth album, i beg to differ. goth is not all ethereal crooning, it is also the intent behind the music. lords of the new church is somewhat rough and early 80s ""rock"" like. it's the sort of music that makes you wonder exactly what it is you're listening to, since it doesn't seem to fall in any one particular gender. i imagine that quite a few people will dislike this album. however, it is definitely worth buying. it's direct, clear-cut, and forceful. russian roulette, in particular, stands out as a wonderful track, slightly calmer & cleaner than the rest, which are more frenzied."
5,Remarkable,"I come to Charles Williams via Owen Barfield, a great thinker and exponent of Rudolf Steiner's work. Williams is unexpected and powerful: I feel as if I should prepare for reading with meditation or prayer... that there is more to receive here than I am calm enough inwardly to hear. It is the depth of the abyss that we all are walking over, unknowingly."
2,Did not include child - returning,This product's description is misleading - I purchased it thinking that it would include at least one bone fide classic child. It did not. It just had some junky costume.
5,Best Costume,"My son loved this costume and got many compliments. He wears frequently around the house. He usually wears 4 or 5, and this fits him perfectly."
4,Cute costume,This fit well for my 5 five year old. We also had the inflatable wings to wear with it. Very cute! The only things I didn't like about it was that its very difficult to get stains out of this material and some of the thread came off it. I would definitely recommend this though!
4,Sizing is an issue,"I bought this costume for my grandson for Christmas. He loved it. I think the quality is good, but the sizing is not. My grandson is 3 and I purchased size 4-6. It fit him perfectly in the torso (no room for growth) and was too long in the legs."
4,calling Buzz Lightyear,"My 3 year old son is a big Toy Story fan and decided he wanted to be Buzz for Halloween. I searched around and finally decided on this one. It's a simple costume, no special features, but I couldn't justify spending a ton of money on a costume. There are no wings, but if you are looking for a basic costume this fits the bill. The costume is lightweight, if the costume will be worn outside in cool weather, layer underneath. My son wore this costume to 2 parties, all day on the Friday before Halloween, and out trick-or-treating and it has held up nicely. Some of the threads are coming loose, but no rips or tears. My son was very happy with this costume, and I have no complaints either"
4,Good value and quality,"This is a good costume. My 2.5 y.o. wore it twice and it's held up. I ordered the 3-4T size for him because I didn't want it to be tight. It was perfect so I'd suggest sizing up. He's a lean kid and on the tall side, but normally wouldn't fit into 4 T. The design of the hood is great because it stays up and didn't seem to annoy him."
3,not buzzing over buzz,I ordered a replacement costume for my son who is hopelessly addicted to pretending he is buzz. The costume is supposed to be identical to one I purchased for Halloween but the fabric is very faded in comparison. Both the original costume and this one are made poorly with seems that rip easily. The only benefit is the price as other buzz costumes are double and triple the price.
4,astronaut costume,"My youngest grandson is going through his astronaut phase, so this Buzz Lightyear costume with a small back pack and a bicycle helmet were part of his third birthday gifts. He is tall, so I ordered the 4-6x size, which fit except I hemmed up the sleeves and tucked the pants into his snow boots. It's a little hard to get him into it from the back, so he can't really do it himself. He's very happy with this outfit and a water gun as a ray gun. Of course, by the time he's old enough to be a real astronaut, there won't be any from the USA."
4,Nice costume for the kids,"My son loved the costume. The fabric is comfortable and not too hot. The only thing is that my son is almost 3 years old and the costume is a little tight on him. I expected the size to fit him fine since it's 3T-4T, but it's a little small and he gets a wedgie. He wears 3T in all of his regular clothes."
2,Can't be washed!,"Of course my child loves this, that's a no-brainer. He's 3. It seemed comfortable and easy (for me) to get on and off. Unfortunately after the 2nd wear I had to hide it because he broke out in a rash.Here's the really fun part. The tag says you can't wash it. At all. No washing, do not immerse in water, do not dry clean, wipe with a wet washcloth.Seriously??? It's a play costume. For a toddler. To play in. But it can't be washed.Anyone considering buying this, if your child has sensitive skin make sure he wears long pants under it and a long sleeved shirt, and be careful not to get anything on it!"
1,Really cheap looking,"I bought this for my 2 yr old, the size was fine, but the costume was really cheap looking. It wasn't much of a step up from the old plastic costumes. I wouldn't recommend this costume. I returned the costume before halloween & the return process was easy/good."
4,Buzz Ligthyear Latino,"I bought this for my little boy for coming ""Dia de Muertos"" , he is 2 years and a half, and it fits perfectly. IT's made of a delicate material, so you have to be careful as it could tear easily (specially if you have puppies)The little cap is excelent and doesn't bother him at all, he wears it all the time (I couldn't save it for Dia de Muertos), for going to the mall, to the movies, to the supermarket :) Overall, I really like it and my son loves it."
4,My Son Loved It!,"This was so cute for my 4 year old for Halloween. It is very lightweight, but that is a good thing here in Texas because usually it is not cold here on Halloween. The cuffs frayed a bit when I washed it, but I just cut off the excess string. Like I said, my son is 4, but I am not sure this will fit him by the time he is 5. Definitely not 6."
4,great costume,"my son really wanted to be buzz for halloween and after looking in all the costume shops around where we live and being told ""we tried to order them but everyones out"" i was glad to find this. he LOVES it. as soon as it came-3 business days- he put it on and wore it everyday..hes 6 and the size 7-8 fits him perfectly..kinda thin so if ur looking at it for a halloween costume wear some long johns under it."
1,"The Company ""FUTURE MEMORIES"" LIARS!!!","The Company ""FUTURE MEMORIES"" really sucks!!!! they will tell you that the item is available and then after so many days they called me and told me it is out of stock and they offer me a much expensive items and gave me information that the items that they are offering me, in replacement to the one that I order is discounted...and I found out from the other customer representative that it is the regular price. THEY ARE SUCH A LIAR AND NOT CONSISTENT ON WHATEVER PRODUCT THAT THEY ARE SELLING."
1,Poor Optical Quality,The optical quality of these glasses is so poor that I cannot wear them. It's like reading through water. I think that the angle of the glasses contributes to the problem.
2,"very small ""angle of view""","These are very skinny glasses. In addition, the brackets where the lenses are attached to, are a little oversized. For example the middle bracket which connects the 2 lenses is 1 3/16"" wide (3 cm). That leaves me a usable lens size of 1 1/4"" by 5/8"" (33mm x 18mm) for each lens. I constantly have to move my head when reading on my 22"" computer screen, or when reading a magazin, or do some office work.These glasses are only usable maybe for travelling (very small and handy hard case) or as an extra one in the glove department."
5,Perfect eyewear,This is the perfect reading glasses to have. Good to use and easy to care and maintain.
2,What's with the hype?...too corny for my taste,"Based on the reviews of this book, I was very excited to be swept away by a great romance novel. While parts of the story were intriguing, I felt the romance itself to be soooo corny. Case in point: when the words ""throbbing"" and ""loins"" occur in the same sentence, you know you've got a cheesy book on your hands.Sorry, just my opinion."
2,Boring but not awful,"Really, I had high hopes for this author since she has so many Scottish historicals out there but The Thistle and the Rose is so incredibly long, drawn out and boring I don't think I'll ever finish. The dialogue is pretty modern for being set in this time period, the characters aren't that interesting, there isn't much intrigue or battle going on so the only redeeming quality thus far seems to be that it's not as awful as some of the free kindle books I've picked up. At 80% I don't know if I have it in me to continue."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR $$ !!,"Love romance novels. First 100 or so pages were promising. While I'm not an authenticity snob, I lost it when Colin invited Celia to do something, & her response was (& I quote) ""I'll pass"". Correct me if I'm wrong, but I strongly suspect that this expression is 20th century in origin used in this way. I simply found Celia's depth & breadth of knowledge too conveniently obtained. Just not something I could lose myself in. Maybe if she'd been a time-traveling college professor..."
3,"Nice light, difficult install.","I am very pleased with the appearance and functionality of these lights, but installation was difficult for me for the following reasons: a) there is not enough clearance for a standard conduit grommet nut; I had to file down one side in order to get the nut screwed down securely, b) the exposed end of the internal wires should be longer, c) care is needed in closing the cover because the wires want to slip into the seam. I'm not sure I'll have an easy time lowering the wire cover if and when I need to replace a bulb."
4,criminal act review,"very good movie, about a male giant carrying/abducting people to be sold as slaves in other countries. in this one he gets daisy from dukes of hazzard and her girlfriend carries daisy over the shoulder and her girfriend under the arm. very good lifting/carrying scenes"
3,Sega's first home console,"When Nintendo was the master of the home console gaming world, Atari was on it's way out, and Sega entered the fray with the flawed but fun Master system. Hardware wise the Master is better than the original NES, with somewhat better graphics and sound, but the game library was sadly lacking. Since Nintendo pretty much had all the third party support it could muster, Sega practically had mainly their first party titles to release for it. Many of them were watered down ports of their arcade titles, but they were nontheless fun games for the system. The Master isn't a bad system at all, but it wouldn't be until the 16-bit era that Sega would release the Genesis; which would catapault the company to success. Below is a list of the best games available for the Sega Master system:After BurnerSpace HarrierOutrunDouble DragonY'sPhantasy Star"
5,Master indeed,"I grew up with one of these. It was, and still is, amazing, which says something for its durability. The games make for some awesome memories, they're very high quality.I was too young to appreciate any console warring between this and the NES, but I can say now, decades later, that every game I've played that was made for both systems has been far superior on this Sega than the Nintendo. And believe me, I'm a big fan of Nintendo, so this is really saying something. Music, graphics, the whole shibang, SMS was the Master of Systems."
1,Not As Stated,"New..... NOT! Not what expected states new but oviously used numerous times. Sorry price to high for This ""Mint"" Cond."
3,"Good indie rock. Slightly askew, and quirky.","This band reminds me somewhat of the Pixies, writing atypical and aggressive, yet melodic songs. Short too with male and female vocals (i love the girl's singing especially). All the songs (a lot!) are good, but some are occasionally wonderful."
4,Daily pearls of wisdom,"My husband gave me this book during my early soul searching days. It was amazing on his part that he actually thought enough to purchase this hard to find book for me. I am truly glad he took the time to do that.Jewel Diamond Taylor offers common sense advice for all people who want to add positive aspects to their life. She uses quotes, short essays, anecdotes and poetry to uplift the spirit and enlighten the mind.This book should be added to anyone's library who wish to make a change in their life."
2,Not as advertised.,These briefs were not as absorbent as advertised and several changes were required during the night. I was disappointed by the quality considering the price paid.
1,A guide only for those who have lots of money to spend on outfitters,"I immediately returned this book. First, there are very few backpacking/hiking trips described in this book. The range of adventures described is all over the place, with some you might need specific skills in like skiing or climbing. Second, and worse, is that all of the trips described require the use of spending big bucks to hire an outfitter to take care of everything, not exactly and adventure as even the author admits."
4,"Dr. Livingstone, I presume?","Noland combines a thorough knowledge of his subject with rapier-sharp writing to produce Travels Along The Edge. As somewhat of a sheltered world traveler myself -- I've been overseas a mere four times, and one of those was only to the Caribbean :) -- I found Noland's tips on packing light and situational awareness to be invaluable. Upon completing the book, I found myself burning to engineer the funds and time to complete some of these travels and expand my understanding of our amazing planet. If you've ever looked around at your mundane surroundings and muttered, ""there's gotta be more to life than this,"" Travels Along the Edge will stoke you to do something about it. Or at least, to dream."
2,An OK game undone by glitches,"I found certain aspects of Chronicles to be a bit annoying and disappointing (like the fact that the four sections of the game are separate events and weapons and other items do not carry over between sections). Overall, though, the game was decent enough until I got to the last level. There, I stumbled upon a number of serious bugs in the program, including one that killed my game and forced me to start over. The frustration caused by this took almost all fun out of this game."
3,TR: Chronicles Review,"Chronicles is clearly the most refined and engaging Tomb Raider game to be released so far. It has some unique play mechanics as well as some intresting and fun levels. The only problem is that the core gameplay is basically unchanged. You won't find anything new or exciting here, just more of the same, which depending on how you look at it is a good or a bad thing. In the end if you think you haven't gotten your fill of Lara and her boobies than by all means pick this one up, you'll enjoy it. On the otherhand if you have gotten tired of the formulatic and traditional TR formula, then leave this one alone. You won;t find enough here to draw you back in."
3,Movies will make you buy games!!,"After seeing the Tomb Raider movie I had to get the latest installment of the game. I figured since my PS2 only does Japanese games, and Tomb Raider isn't out for that yet, that I'd get the next best thing. Although the Dreamcast enhances the graphics better the PSX (not sure about PC) the controls are extemely difficult, and the game is more frustrating then it is fun. ..."
2,Avoid Dreamcast Version,"If you have to get this game, either get the pc version or playstation version. This game is full of bugs. I reccomend the playstation version because of its stability. Once you get past that the game is not too bad. Also at the end of the dreamcast version there is a glitch that can wipe out your save."
1,"Okay, that's ENOUGH","I hope i'm not the only person out there who isn't tired of Lara. It's not just the blatant pandering of her body, but the fact that the Tomb Raider games have been using the same graphics with minor tweaks for years now. And still she sells. I'm confused. The only difference between the old Tomb Raider games and this one is that now this game is on the Dreamcast, so the graphics don't seem to be the same old thing over again. But I'd say let's move on people. They say Lara's dead in this game anyway, so let's let her die."
3,This game Has its good and bad points,I have This game and so far the only good part about is when jump off of something and hold the jump button down and she snaps her neck when falling
4,Tough to beat for the money,"Excellent scope for .22 Henry rifle, but mount just barely fit short Henry rail. Great optics for the money - bright, sharp, and easy sight-in adjustment. 4x just the right magnification for effective range of .22 round. Found it cheaper online after purchasing from Amazon. Sadly, it appears it may soon be discontinued."
1,Worst noodles ever,I love this brand of ramen and I was so disappointed that these were not only all smashed but also tasted like they were 10 years old. They were completely inedible. Total waste of money.
4,Right On,Sighted in in 3 shots and small groups after that.Holds zero after a weekend under the back seat in the pickup.Havent tried it on game yet but is great on paper @ 50yrds.
4,Rings are useless for a weaver rail.,"The scope is a very good buy for the money. With good bore sighting, there is no need to mount something more expensive than this on a .22 rimfire rifle. Nice optics. And windage and elevation are actually not that hard to adjust. The only problem I see with the scope is that the clamp of the rings that go with it is too narrow; while it mounts on the narrow/dovetail rail of a 10-22, it does not mount on a weaver rail, which has a wider width. So, if one plans to use this scope on a rifle with a weaver rail (like the 597 VTR), make sure that the separate cost of buying scope rings (about ten bucks) that are compatible with a weaver rail is taken into account in the purchase."
3,bushnell scope,Will not work on all .22 mag bolt action. Bolt hits power ring and will not open fully. Not enough room to slide scope enough to operate bolt. Scope is ok
4,Priced right,"I was surprised how large this scope is. It actually looks a little funny on my Henry 001. But for the most part, it works great, and at the price, I don't feel you can really go wrong.I can't give it five stars, however, because the description isn't completely accurate. The scope is supposed to have ""1/4 M.O.A. fingertip windage and elevation adjustments."" You actually need a pocket knife, screwdriver or at least a coin (a car key might work, too) to make any windage or elevation adjustments. This is fine for static shooting at a range, but if you need to make a quick adjustment, you're out of luck.I would also add that the lens cloth is worthless and frays easily, and the covers are a little on the cheap side, too.But, for the price, it's really hard to go wrong. The scope works well, I just wish it was easier to make on-the-spot windage adjustments.BTW, it was a cinch to zero the scope."
5,Best Educational Kids Show Ever!!,These are the perfect radio shows to get your kids interested in history and science!
2,This is NOT Depeche Mode,I got fooled into believing this is Depeche Mode's album. This is someone else singing and a return of the MP3 goods in not possible.
3,A politically astute yet strangely passionless book.,"I finished ""Looking for Trouble"" feeling unsatisfied -- I was impressed by Leslie's courage and stamina, but left untouched by her or any of the people she meets on her travels. There is a strange lack of human feeling in the book, an offshoot of her journalist background perhaps? As a result, her husband (who appears frequently in the text) is completely faceless, as are many of the famous third world figures she meets (with the exception of Saddam Hussein's son, who is well drawn). Despite this, the book is well worth reading for the insight she offers on US policy and UN intervention in Third World countries, and how this intervention causes as much trouble as good -- but it will leave you thirsty for more."
3,"ok, too detailed though",The book was good in the beginning. After a while it got too detailed and unexiting.
3,Lively account of journalist's Third World coverage career,"The book opens with Cockburn(the author)and Barbara Walters in Afghanistan to interview Talliban leaders. Cockburn proceeds with a lively account of her career as a TV journalist and producer who specializes in exposing unknown aspects of the most dangerous places on earth. She describes how she interviewed members of the Columbian cocaine cartels, Col. Khadafi, and members of Saddam Hussein's family, and covered covert and overt wars from the Sudan to Cambodia to the 1990 Gulf War, all the while contending with risks of tropical diseases (esp. cerebral malaria), land mines and itchy fingers on automatic weapons. She's had some incredible adventures in places most people would never voluntarily travel to and exposed some seamy sides of U.S. foreign policy. Her comments about the choice of what is aired on the nightly news were interesting. My only regret: she didn't interview Osam bin Laden on that trip to Afghanistan!"
4,CRAZY AS HELL,A real good movie full of religious overtones. Fine acting performaces by both Eriq La Salle and Michael Beach. Very nice twist at the end.
1,A colossal waste of time,The folks who wrote this script don't have a clue about mental illness or treatment. A bit of research would have helped. The plot was simplistic and the ending telegraphed. Other than LaSalle displaying some on camera charisma the film had no redeeming qualities. Don't waste your time on it. You can get more meaning out of a classic comic. A colossal waste of time.
4,Solid R.E.M. for fans of Murmur or Document,"Great follow-up to sounds like Murmur and others. Creative, fun folky pop-rock, tunes in the style of Bob Dylan/Beatles and 70s folk-rock. FANS .... Add to your collection. Casual Listeners... great listen throughout album.Some impressive advancements from earlier works. Great prelude to Document and Out of Time"
4,An under-rated and overlooked album,"Reckoning was the first R.E.M. album I bought, after seeing them sing ""So. Central Rain"" on Late Night with David Letterman. I loved it then and still cherish it now. Though not as good as Murmur, most of the tracks hold up surprisingly well compared to their first album. Highlights include the above mentioned track, ""Harborcoat,"" ""7 Chinese Brothers,"" and the country-influenced ""Don't Go Back to Rockville."" A must."
3,Didn't wear as well as I thought it would,"I know I'm in the minority, but this is my least favorite early R.E.M. album. I still adore Pretty Persuasion, Letter Never Sent, and especially Harborcoat. But so many other songs just annoy me now, esp. the seemingly endless refrains of Little America and Rockville (which 10,000 Maniacs helped become too familiar). At least Stipe's lyrics are easier to understand than on Murmur and Fables of the Reconstruction, but I find the songwriting weaker here. Please don't bother to tell me that disliking this album is anathema-- I'm aware of that."
3,Not one of REM's best albums,"This being REM's second album and as the band was still trying out new styles, I have understood that they needed to experiment with songs to find out what style was best for the band. However this album even for the most diligant REM fan, he or she will be disappointed.Not only were the songs below par, but the lyrics were themselves a puzzle to work out. I was pretty much disappointed in this album but still this was very early on in the band's musical life. They did improve and improve they did."
1,Slowly disappointing,"I was ready to give this book 5 stars after the first chapter. I finished the book now, one star it is.Pros:- Well structured.- Lots of helpful exercises.Cons:- Grammar mistakes. Not typos, mistakes. Everywhere, in examples and answers. (p168 - Elle lui a dit qu'elle ne voudrait sortir pas avec lui. - same page - Il lui pourrait acheter des fleurs.)- Some examples have nothing to do with the rules next to them.- Redundant vocabulary. Not sure if it's the age of the authors or the place where they live, but literature students from la sorbonne did make fun of ""web site"" and ""courriel."" Don't even want to get into the ways they built some sentences.Bottom line:Don't understand why this book has so many positive reviews. It is exactly like other French grammar books out there - often confusing and full of mistakes."
3,Kindle is not useful to make small text larger,"I wanted to have this on my Kindle however when reviewing the free trial it was obvious that the exercises and lists must be in a different format and do not augment the letters/exercises at all and some are very very small on a kindle screen. I hope a remedy for this issue with Kindle and various study books becomes available very soon, maybe Kindle 4??"
3,Average description of the Civil War...,"Having majored in history, I simply can't say that this book deserves more than three out of five stars. I can see where some people would enjoy it; I was impressed by the obvious amount of research that went into it, as well as Anders' frequent use of direct quotes and excerpts from letters. However, in my opinion he simply didn't spend enough time discussing some of the more major battles, and then would go on for pages and pages about much less significant occurrences. I also feel that he cut the book short by not adding at least a little more information on Reconstruction."
5,Great Book,"The book ""Winged Life"" was truly inspirational...almost common sense. It's presented in a clear workable way with immediate application to my life."
1,Gasoline,"OPINION: This guy is a self serving idiot, only interested in selling books through his smack talk. A guy with gasoline, waiting for a fire.REAL REPUBLICAN"
5,Must Read,"This book will keep you in touch and inform you of the many issues today's media intentionally does not communicate to the general public, in a way only Savage can tell it."
3,Funny but Hurtful,"I'm all for satire but this is basically a mean-spirited book. I did laugh at some of the text but I felt a little sorry for some of the celebs being mocked. I'm also a Bill O'Reilly fan. I thought O'Reilly, Limbaugh and Dr. Savage were all on the same side. Guess not."
2,It's alright,"Not really that impressed by this one. The art was ok but all in black and white pencils, and the text was not very funny.. GET THE NEW ANN COULTER!! HILARIOUS!!!"
3,"Michael, Moliere and Misanthropy","This book is nothing new. Satire is nothing new. Satire is definitely an effective weapon of stimulus-response revolution, but at who's and what expense? The isolation of the satirist.Swift was hated by the people he hated, and Moliere wrote a play about the man who hates other men. It doesn't turn out well. Mr. Savage is probably a self-hating misanthrope."
5,Great Read!!,"Very good political humor. He does not pull any punches and does not take sides. Does not matter if they are left or right, he just tells it like it is. Had me laughing a LOT!!!"
2,Not an original idea,"Google this title:""Mr. Punch's Animal Land""(it's available and downloadable at Open Library)It is a book by E. T. Reed, a British author, published in 1898.Is it possible Savage found this and used it as a template?"
3,A Waste of Wood Pulp,"I like to listen to Savage. I own all his books. I like his other books. However, I see no point in this one other than he probably had fun putting it together. It doesn't even ""read"" like Savage. Did he actually write it? What is it's conclusion? What action are we to take?Sorry, I can't / don't recommend this to anyone unless you have absolutely nothing else to do. It's pointless. I gave it three stars because I chuckled three times."
2,need polevault pole,"Not much else to say but I am 5'3"" and need a stool to get up one it! at its lowest level."
4,Good table,"I bought this CHANGING TABLE (not crib like the last review) for my daughter three months ago. My husband was warry of the purchase at first b/c it didn't seem overly sturdy when we looked at it in the store. But when we got it home and set up things looked better (I think it was just assembled hap-hazardly for display). I really like the storage area underneath with both opened and closed shelving. I also like the railing all the way around to help keep my daughter on the table. This table gets the job done! I only gave it four stars b/c the railing was a little annoying at first b/c my daughter, who loves to kick, would get her foot caught (caught, NOT stuck) in the side, but that was easily remedied with a home-made mini bumper.And for those who are wondering..it comes with a cushioned changing pad so you don't need to go buy one (like we did) unless you want an extra."
1,COLLAPSED ON MY BABY!,"The top paper board on which the baby lies, fell through on the side with the open shelves luckily I was quick enough to catch my child. If anyone has this one, be careful. I'm glad it seems as though no one is selling this one anymore."
5,small enough to fit in my pocket,Perfect size for not bogging down my pockets. Solidly made with useful tools. Especially like having a wire stripper handy. Also like the tweezers--which have already been useful several times. Very nice tool.
4,Lightening In His Hands,Tesla's contributions through his inventions are amazing toay although he was more than 100 years ahead of his time. What a great mind!
1,No value for true seekers of knowledge,"I agree with Path Walker. If you are truly trying to find mental travel techniques,youdon't want to bother with life stories.Example: If you ask ""How can I learn to meditate?"".My answer should not start with,""Well when I was 6 years old blah blah blah....When you truly seek books to teach ,glance through the book.Seek knowledge,overstand it,then live it."
2,Battery Back-Up My . . .,"Radio reception is okay, but not great. I had to run on back-up batteries for several days. I was surprised at how quickly this emergency radio drains power from (4) new alkaline batteries. My suggestion is to have at least (20) batteries to last through a storm."
3,No off switch,This worked well as a NOAA Weather Radio. My big complaint is that there is no OFF switch so it burns thru batteries much too fast.
4,Great weather alert radio,I'm very satisfied with the weather alert radio. I no longer have to be viewing network tv in order to be alerted about upcoming storms. Great purchase.
2,Not so much,"This does alert you for whatever weather pattern you have it programmed for, which is nice to be able to pick different weather patterns, but it is hard to program."
4,Great radio to keep on top of severe weather,This radio works great and is customizable for your area. It could literally be a life saver come tornado season. My only complaints are the instruction manual is not well written/confusing and the button layout is not intuitive and after reading the manual I'm still not ready sure what some of them do.
4,Weather radio,"good radio, only down fall is that the county we live in is so large we get alerts for tornados that are well over 60 miles so that can be annoying."
4,Great Asset!!,This is a great alert radio. Easy to program (you do need to have access to the internet to get frequencies specific to your area). I like the fact that it can be plugged in so it does not drain your batteries. They are there when you need them. Also the alert tone is loud enough the unit can be placed anywhere in your home or office and you are sure to hear it. 4 stars is the highest rating I give.
4,Public Alert Radio,"Product performs as expected, however, there has been no severe weather conditions to fully test it's performance."
4,Weather Radio,"Was easy to set up, and when we have had local weather conditions, it has always alerted us to the watches and the warnings. Very easy to hear throughout the entire house. Plugged in our county code, and the only alerts we get are the ones we need.Would have been nice to have a larger display, but not a big deal."
4,Died in a thunderstorm,"Spent the time after receiving the product to read all the instructions, go to the NOAA website, program in the SAME codes and change all the settings to match what I wanted to hear. Next night we had a heavy thunderstorm come through and the unit quit working. No power on any screen for either battery (alkaline) or AC. Amazon replacement was hassle free. 2nd unit has been running for about two weeks now and made it through a few storms. Since I work on chips that drive these types of devices I am concerned about the surge protection built into these units by 1st alert. I have had both units on surge suppressors so an overvoltage should not have occurred. Will have to wait and see if the new one will have a similar issue."
2,Battery Problem,Great unit except....placed new alkaline batteries in it with switch set to alkaline. Unit has been plugged in with no power outages. Found today that batteries are all dead. Apparently this will use the battery power for some reason even when it is plugged in.
4,"GREAT, will keep, but drains alkaline batteries","First, I have received at least 6 tornado warnings via this unit and a couple of those tornados touched down not far from our house. Second, an earlier reviewer noted that the radio drains alkaline batteries, and I have confirmed this. On 23 April all 4 new batteries were at 1.6v. On 25 April, 2 of the 4 were at 1.6v and the other 2 (located on the right side of the compartment) were at 1.46v. Lastly, I might switch to rechargeables, but either way, I will KEEP this radio and recommend it to others."
4,great but...,"This is all i was looking for, since I moved to the US and got surprised by a tornado once (only nearby luckily).The only thing I am not fon of is that the warnings do not always correlate with the warnings the NOAA has for my area posted.But all tornadowarnings were on both, so this is not really an issue.You can choose which alarms you want to get with sound, all others will just show via a flashing light. Warnings red, watches yellow.Sound alarm can come by computervoice reading out the warning or alarm."
5,Easy to use and set up,This was easy to use and a breeze to set up. Getting it out of the box was the hardest part. Setting it up specific to my area was no problem.
4,Right on the money,"After a tornado touched down 30 miles from where I reside, I decided to purchase a weather alert radio. After weighing all my options and reading many reviews I purchased the First Alert WX-150. Setup was easy. A couple of days ago we had several thunderstorm warnings and 1 hour before they hit the watch light and alarm came on. Then 5 minutes before the storm hit the warning light and siren came on again. It's timing was perfect. My only complaint is the display is a little small for my taste but I highly recommend it."
1,Died after about 2 years,"I purchased this radio in July 2009. A little after 2 years, it now fails to receive the alerts. It lights up, it can received broadcasts after you push the button, but it won't automatically sound the alarm in reaction to a weather alert. I contacted the company and they quickly responded to try to help, but it doesn't work. I've reprogrammed it twice, moved it around the house, even took it to work to try to pick up the maintenance alert that goes out every Wednesday, but nothing works. I'm disappointed and won't purchase this manufacturer again."
5,Works as advertised,"I've had this weather radio for a few weeks now, and it works as advertised. We've had a variety of storm and flood warnings this spring, and the radio has only alerted for the type of warning and the county that I programmed it for.No complaints really, other than the light is really bright, so I put it under the bed. That way the alarm will still wake us up, but the light is hidden."
5,Works like a charm,We bought this because the tornado sirens in our area wouldn't wake us in the middle of the night. The S.A.M.E. technology is nice to have because you can program what watches/warnings you want to receive audible alerts for. It will flash a watch light but no alarm unless you choose to be alerted. We got it for tornado warnings specifically and it just went off as we were getting ready to go to bed. So we're in the basment now and are thankful we bought this little gem. It's given us definite peace of mind. I'd recommend it to anyone.
5,Perfect for the job,"This is a great weather/alert radio. The directions were clear and easy to follow. It does everything the Midland WR-100B radio does, plus much more for only a few dollars extra.On this radio you can delete watches that you do not need or wish to hear. Another big plus is that the volume can be changed. This is a biggy if you are going to place it beside your bed. It has individual lights for watches, warnings, and advisories if you should miss an alert while you are out. It has a big enough screen that missed messages can be read easily.I also own the Midland WR-100B radio, which is a dependable, but very basic radio. The First Alert seems to have more quality built in and is easier to use. This radio would be my first choice."
1,Plastic lid parts all broke off - terrible,"We would never buy this again: the plastic hardware on the lid has all snapped and broken off (sometimes with dangerous consequences when full of hot food!). In fact, this a REPLACEMENT unit for one whose control panel died!Bottom line: I would not buy this model, and likely not buy another product from this vendor."
2,"Cooks well, shoddy lid","We've used the SCVC600 perhaps 30 times, with very good results. However, both plastic parts of the lid broke during gentle use. We were able to replace the center handle with a Creuset screw-on handle, but the tilt-up-the-lid attachment is unrepairable and therefore remains unusable. Rival lists replacement lids ($12) as ""out of stock,"" but I am not confident that they ever have them."
1,Dead crockpot,Mine just crapped out on me. The time setting knob no longer does anything which pretty much makes this thing a paperweight. It's not like we used it 4 times a week either. We only got about a dozen uses out of it. So much for the flagship product of the Crockpot lineup...
3,Where is Cherokee?,"I notice this album has 23 tracks. I have the vinyl version, which has 24 tracks. Without question the high point of the vinyl album is 'Cherokee', where Doug Jernigan does some amazing pedal steel work. But that's the missing track for some reason. Not worth buying without it."
4,A word from the author................,"Okay, I know some of you will question the objectivity of the author writing a review of his own work but I intend just to give some information regarding this book.I have used the material in this book with my students at Musicians Institute for many years now and have gotten great results. After working through this book my students are much better players and improvisors. Regardless of your level and musical background you can get allot out of this book/CD. So, if you are into blues and want a good primer on blues guitar or play other styles but just want to improve your blues playing, then this book is for you!"
5,Teh best online game there is.,"Number 1. Im saying this to crw1998. Ive played this game for a year and a half. And u cant get jailed for saying ""Im a pony."" You can get BANNED or suspended for harrassing people after they tell you to stop. Anyways. This is one of the best online games. They came out with a new thing called Ultima Online Third Dawn. This will 3d enhance some of the graphics. You can be a variety of different professions. Even a theif! You can cast magic, or fight with sword and shield. Fight mongbats...dragons....Earth Elementals...etc! I recommend getting this game over and over again."
1,Do not waste your money,This game is a washout primarily b/c it will not install without sacificing 3 hours to the hexadecimal gods. Do not waste your time or money on this inept concept!
2,Not what I expected,"No where in the product description did it state that it was 5/8 inch. I bought this thinking it was a short piece of 1/2 copper that I could use a standard end cap on. I didn't purchase it for it's original purpose, to repair copper pipe. I bought it to use as a sparge arm for home brewing. Now I have very little use for it."
2,not as described,"This DVD has a SHORT section of the Last Supper, along with A LOT of other stories. The cover/title should perhaps be different, in order to reflect that fact. We needed a video version of the Last Supper for a children's activity, and this was a waste of money for that purpose. That said, the video is good, just falsely marketed and erroneously titled!"
2,A substandard O'Reilly offering,"This book has its conceptual merits and demerits. But let's give the authors the benefit of the doubt, and let's assume that this is a decent introduction to its subject matter. I'd still advise against purchasing it, as in detail it's extremely unreliable and often confused.Since I started counting, I've found an error every 4 to 5 pages. Some are cosmetic, but some seriously damage the value of the examples and descriptions. The text contradicts itself at several points; some examples don't produce the results the text says they will; some figures are glaringly broken.This book is the victim of an obviously poor editing job, for which I blame O'Reilly more than the authors. Either way, you should probably look elsewhere unless you already know enough to silently correct all the errors you'll find."
2,Read my review,"I am a well versed programmer who has read many programming books by many different authors. If you are a person who learns by visual do not get this book. Here are some of the pitfalls of this book.1. They throw globs of code at you and do not explain what any of it is doing. You have to figure it out for yourself.2. This book is not a step by step book for beginners, you will get lost.3. The name and the reviews fooled me. This book is not for the beginner who would like to advance into the subject of creating Dynamic web sites.If anyone knows of a good book on the subject of creating dynamic web sites using php, and that is very visual and in a step by step format please let me know."
3,Fairly Useful,"The book got me off the ground with my first client application, a rudimentary database maintenance system. Most valuable were the techniques and thorough understanding required to build a satisfactory security component.However, it falls way short as a reference tool and could have included a more comprehensive list of mysql functions."
2,Not Worth It,"My background - a little bit of perl, BASIC language, html.This book in the first 2 or 3 chapters walks you through as to 'what is PHP?', after that it becomes confusing, like what one reviewer have posted, the book becomes more of theoritical in its approach.I would highly recommend 'PHP and MySQL Web Development' for those who are looking for that 'step by step' approach. Nothing like PHP for Dummies but just an indepth guide to proper PHP scripting.The authors of 'Web Database Application' may be experts in PHP scripting but should need to develop their teaching ability.Needless to say, this book is gathering dust."
2,Errata Galore,"New to PHP and haven't touched SQL in quite a few years. I was looking for a good beginning PHP book, not overly simplified as I have some programming experience. I needed to see how PHP and MySQL were to interact and how to set up everything on my machine (Mac). I've used MANY O'Reilly books and they're always topnotch, but this one is so disappointing to me as I find it is riddled with errors and typos. It is one thing to see typos in text and another thing altogether to have to figure out what a mistake in a code example is supposed to say. I expected more, especially since it's a 2nd edition. If it wasn't for all the forums on the web, I never even would have gotten Apache/PHP/MySQL up and running. This book isn't useless. Just not good."
4,Buy this book,"If your having trouble deciding on a book for your php & mysql development buy this book. It covers all major aspects of php and mysql web development and then some. You will find something useful on every page of this book, and theres a good amount of book here."
3,Good book but it's only for Unix/Linux users,"This book is excelent for Unix/Linux users, it explains everything for the Unix/Linux users. For other operating system users it will be a pain in the head."
2,= * + *,"If you want to read 400+ pages of Hugh and Lane's secret vineyard , then buy this book...BR>The content barely scratches the surface of what you can realise with PHP and MySQL.Gone are the days of creating mediocre small level applications with PHP/MySQL.Today PHP has grown by strengths and this text is hardly and sadly not reflective of that fact."
5,Review of Web Based Database Applications,A fine work that covers all aspects of this fascinating field. The worked example of the on line wine store that runs through the book is both helpful and interesting and brings to fore the workability of the content. Great work!
4,A straight-forward made-easy presentation,"This has been my first ever book purchase through Amazon. I was quite fortunate to select this book. Clear cut presentations, abundance of samples and professional reasoning.I fully recommend this book, both to novice users and IT professionals!"
5,A good grounding in PHP/mySQL,"I've been entrenched with JSP heavily for the last couple of years, so I haven't familiarised myself with PHP yet. I needed a book that would show me a larger picture than I got in a web developer's job, and showed me how to put it together with more modern techniques.This book is a perfect example of why I choose O'Reilly whenever in doubt. Chapter 1 is an overview of how web applications are put together. Chapter 2 goes through all the basic PHP syntax (stuff that would take other books several fluffy dry chapters to process). Chapter 3 gets you through all the mySQL and sql basics so you feel comfortable with that, too.There's no 4 page tutotial entitled: ""Using a text editor: Wordpad"" There's also no kitch ""Employee Database"" example cop-out. Instead, Hugh and Dave give a realistic and usable storefront application. This book alone is probably enough for the independent web developer to get a functional site up for her/himself or a client."
3,"Good Book, Serious ERRORS","This is a good book with a nice overview of the stated subjects.However, I cannot evaluate the application presented because the appendix on installing Easy PHP on Microsoft Windows has SO MANY ERRORS that I simply cannot get this software running. In particular the PEAR installation instructions are just completely wrong.I will try a Linux environment next, since I can debug better in that environment."
1,Example Winestore Application does not work on Linux,"After going through a lot of trouble, the winestore application does not work. I am sorry that I bought this book."
5,A classic album - pure genius,"Some people like ""Gravest Hits."" But for my money, ""Psychedelic Jungle"" represents the Cramps' masterwork. Swampy, bluesy, dark and menacing. One, er, critic called it racist. Could be that says more about him than it does about the Cramps. Anyhow, this album shows that these voodoobilly idols not only ooze, they rock.10 stars."
3,80s Music At It's Best,"This CD sure takes me back to my high school days, when videos were creative and music was fun. ""Tenderness"" - I love that song. ""Are You Leading Me On"" is another hot one. Lyrically and musically fun."
3,TENDERNESS,"1984 Brit pop group dabbling in funk and ska yielded one great song; ""Tenderness"", a jingly piano-driven, bassoon enhanced, unabashedly sweet, catchy song that contains maybe the most representative line of '80s suppressed left wing agenda, - ""I open my mouth and out pops something spiteful."", it rises above the hyperactive vocals and dull routine funk of the other songs, although the song, ""General Public"", adds Middle Eastern and progressive elements in a grandiose album closing. Band member, Ranking Roger (vocals, keyboards), has put out at least one fine Motown influenced solo album, and Clash guitarist Mick Jones, plays some rough guitar on some of the tracks. The band needs to lean more towards it's tender side than it's frantic funk."
5,Still sounds completely fresh in the year 2000,"Both this album and GP's later ""Hand To Mouth"" are simply a delight, light years above not just the schlock from the 80's, but above even the good stuff as well. Dave's voice is a slice of heaven and his lyrics are razor-sharp, filled with clever metaphors and double-meanings. (Example: ""your friends get laid on stony ground""). Roger's harmonies play off him very well too. Musically, the songs are surprisingly intricate. For instance, ""Never You Done That"" has a structure much more complex than a standard pop song-- yet manages to be incredibly stick-in-your-brain catchy at the same time. And ""Anxious"" can't decide whether it is a pop song or a reggae song-- which is what makes it so great, because it is both at the same time. And who could forget the all-time classic ""Tenderness"", alone worth the price of the album. This album is essential if you're into 80's, and nevertheless a complete treat if you're not. DON'T MISS IT!"
4,too damn good not to have,"I came of age in the eighties, and this is one of the albums I cut my teeth on. This is smart power pop on par with Elvis Costello and Joe Jackson, with ska inflections that will make your leg twitch. In fact, the toughest thing about listening to this album is figuring out whether to groove to the music or soak up the lyrics. I would give it five stars, but there are a few weaker tracks. But 'Never you done that','Tenderness', and 'Where's the line' make up for those. If you like ska, eighties music, or good, smart lyrics, I STRONGLY recommend ""All The Rage""."
1,don't buy this brand,"Sent item back to the company and got a rejected mail saying, ""COMPANY OUT OF BUSINESS, RETURN TO SENDER"". The company address on the label is:Recoton Accessories, Inc.2950 Lake Emma RoadLake Mary, FL 32746.Made in China"
5,A must in every latin/salsa music collection.,"In this album, we, Tito's music lovers, will find a classic repertoir of the true latin rhythms of the pre-salsa era. This album is a ""must"" in every latin/salsa collections. Tito's natural voice at its prime, are present in all the cha-cha and guaguanco numbers of this magnificent collection of his best original songs. Numbers such as El Jamaiquino and Chica ni Lambo are examples of versatility of his music. This music transfered to the CD technique is perfect for the listener to appreciate all the latin sounds and Tito's lyrics."
5,What a year in MotoGP!,"Wow, what a year in MotoGP! Not only were there new faces joining the circuit, many of the new riders gave it their all from day one. It was great to see how the season unfolded between Casey Stoner, Dani Pedrosa, Vale and Lorenzo. The battles between Vale and Lorenzo were classic and it was great to see the Doctor come out on top this past season but look for an even better 2010 season. I wish the disc would include more extras, behind-the-scenes and post race interviews which always seems to be cut off by the Speed Network. Oh well, at least I have access to MotoGP races online, eh?"
5,Moto gp dvd,Boyfriend just loves all the exciting action and is a collector of these racing dvds. Great for keeping up with who still in the lead.
4,MotoGP Official Review '09,The program always shows just short clips of the season. I understand there is limited space on a DVD yet they do a pretty fair job when providing a synopsis of the season. Yet it would be awesome to ride a lap with the pole setter and rarely do they identify the pilot on the lap that is provided on the DVD. I can make a guess to the characteristics of the engine. Please provide the pole lap on the DVD. It would be neat to know that the lap the public sees IS the fastest lap of the year! Just my opinion ; )
4,"Basic, but does the job","I got this because I wanted a cheap heart rate monitor, and that it is. It has a watch part to wear on the wrist and a band to go around your chest. They operate wirelessly and are comfortable enough to not notice once you've worn them for a while.The functionality offered is basic to say the least: On or Off. That's about it. The only other thing you can do is view the readings (Average, Min, Max and Session duration) from the last time it was running by holding down the button for a long time when it is off.While on it displays the current heart rate and the session time (time on). That's it, but what do expect for the price! Good value for money. If you want a watch, alarms or more extended features, you will need to spend more."
4,ufc 48,"i was expecting kimo to win, but got knocked out insstead, all of the other fights were great and action packed. if you like action, or just a collector of the UFC like me, pick this 1 up."
4,If not for the main event...,"... this would have been a possible five star event. I remember Zuffa trying to hype the fight between Shamrock and Kimo... as if this were the match-up of the decade. As much as I respect Ken Shamrock, I simply cannot understand hyping this fight as the main event for any reason other than name recognition. The title fight between Mir and Sylvia should have been the main draw on this card.That said, this was an extremely entertaining event to watch. UFC delivers once again with this one. Buy it. If you love MMA, BUY IT!!"
1,Can I give a negative rating?,"UFC 48 is one of the worst events I've ever seen. The main event is a fight between two old tomato cans that don't belong on a kotc card let alone a ufc card. The co main event features a fat, chicken-legged champ who's not even ranked in the world top 5 taking on a Jiu-Jitsu fighter with ZERO cardio. You can tell that all these guys have very little skill compared to the guys in Pride and sometimes are akin to fat barroom brawlers.Pride FC is the top organization in the world. Sadly, the UFC is far behind."
1,Don't Bother,Just terrible and not worth the money. The fights are horrible and the fighters have very little skill. Puchase PRIDE instead where the best fighters in the WORLD come to fight.
3,Love Sims,I wasn't as pleased with this Sims Game as I have been in the past.... took a while to get it up an going on my Mac.
4,My Favorite Game,I love the Sims games they are realy fun I have been playing them since I was 5 wiht my 13 year old brother and sister. They are really fun to play alone and with a family.
1,I hate it,It ruined my computer and doesn't even work! If I were you I would never buy this game for a mac! It on;y works on normal computers!
2,Poor translation of the sacred text,"The translation stays true to using the name of Jehovah in the Old Testament. However, it has some major drawbacks: This religious organization changes the meaning of Biblical text to fit their own theology. The 'scholars' who are responsible for this contextual nightmare are not listed anywhere in the 'Bible', nor are they recognized and identified by the publisher, the Watchtower Society. This replaced the King James (The KJV was officially used up until the late 1950's). The King James led to too many questions (from the faithful) about the lack of context in Watchtower teaching."
2,"Long on Stories and Acronyms, Short on Substance","I give this book two stars because it may have a few stories I can use somewhere along the way, and because it has catchy acronyms. Unfortunately, these two traits are the strengths of the title. Toler here presents very little substance for a pastor who wants to cultivate teamwork in his congregation.If you want a good resource as a pastor or as a lay leader to promote cooperation in your church, this one is likely to disappoint you."
1,Limited playability,"For 20 bucks, you don't get much. Limited playablity, poor graphics, seems to cause memory errors on my machine. Bogs down when you have many opponents in play (I have a top of the line Pentium), Pretty much when you get to the higher levels, you've done it all...which you can do in one afternoon if your a shooter/player like me. Hard to fire and aim with mouse controls.......I wouldn't buy this one...wish I'd read the reviews on this one!"
3,Mindless fun,"I agree with most of the other reviewers. The game is fun but does get repetitive since you never leave your pill box looking over the beach. Since I bought my copy at the dollar store, I feel I got my money's worth."
4,A very good game for those that won't pick it apart,"Simply put: this game isn't meant for those who are used to, say, Diablo 2, Deus Ex, and other extremely deep games. This has an idea that shouldn't go over-looked: but it was designed for special little groups of war-buffs and action-game-lovers, because those are the kind of people who don't care about going through 100 levels to see if they can break their old score record. I personally enjoyed a game where it only took 5 seconds to load and then theres action right there where you can play it. A great game, for those who can appreciate mindless action of blowing enemy soldiers and tanks away."
2,Entertaining...for a time.,"Frankly, this game lacks, alot. The graphics are fair, but repeatitive. Game play is straight forward and engaging for a while, but soon gets boring. It is a good game for releasing some tensions but that is about the limit of it's use."
1,did not work,"it was a piece of shit, it did not work all i got was an error message and would not download, do not buy"
3,Good4 a hour Bad 4 Life,This is a cool game where you shoot falling object to get ammo and have good controlls (see my review for beach head 2002) but this gets tiring REALLY fast. I mean fast. The difference between the(inflinate)levels are the # of men no more weapons of bonuses or change or scenery all the same. This gets boring FAST.youll be bored by the time you finish loking at the box! Its all the same thing. Even if you like games like these when your REALLY bored you may pop this in for a 2 minute break(it beats homework)but thats about it. Well hope this told you something and was helpfull.
1,Beach Head (And the point of this game is...),"There is absolutley no point to this game! Alls you do is man guns on a beach and shoot at endless numbers of enemies! BORING! The game is very repetetive and boring. There are only 3 guns: 2 machine gun like things, a big cannon (which only has like 3 rounds of ammo each new level), and a stupid pistol with 7 rounds, and no extra clip to reload. The graphics are cartoony as well as the violence. There is blood, but not enough. This game was rushed to the market. It could have been alot better. Personally, i dont like this game. It has no story line, bad graphics, and only 3 weapons. This is a good game for people who like to play mindless shooters. If you want a game with a good story line like Red Faction or Half-Life, dont look here. Also, dont buy the sequal to this game, Beach head 2002, because it [stinks] just as much. -Patrick"
3,Plastic,"This medallion is listed as being made of wood. It is not, it is made of plastic. I was very disappointed and returned the item. It was quick and easy to return thanks to Amazon..."
3,Plastic ceiling medallion,"This is a cheap plastic medallion that one would not ordinarily want to use because of its appearance. The saving grace is that it can be painted to look fairly decent, so if you're willing to make the effort to paint, it's not a bad value."
3,Not a bad read,"Manschreck's text was written for the intermediate student of Christian History. If you're looking for an intro text, this is not it. On the other hand, if you want something that will take you months to devour, this is still not it. The author does a good job in covering as much of christian history as the average reader can stand. Though he ignores the demise of paganism and because of the date of publication, it will not include any newer developments in Christianity. A good book, but try and buy a used copy, it's not worth the price of a new one."
3,"Good on comfort, WRONG on SIZE","The sole is extremely comfortable, and the leather is fairly soft.Made in China, yet surprisingly well made.However, don't bother ordering unless you're absolutely sure about your sizing with Bostonian. According to the DH, he would get about 7.5-8 in shoes. The 8 was too large, nearly 1 size more? There were 2 inches toes to tip of inner shoe. Not sure if this is consistent with shoes normally sold in Bostonian's retail stores."

2,"Helpful, but intimidating","I liked this book, but found it very intimidating. The overview of all the types of events was interesting. However, all of the protocol on writing invitations, placecards, thank-you notes, ect. made me feel like all a military wife does is go to teas and coffees and host similar events. Now that I have had time to think about it, I realize that this will be such a small part of life and that the book is a handy reference for those occassions. My husband is getting ready to go to officer school and jag school. This book gave me an insight on what to expect at the Dining Out and other events. As to the rest of military life, I found the book lacking. I really don't feel like it told me much beyond the etiquette."
1,Great 20 Book for AF life 20 years ago but times have changed,"I received this handy book as a new AF spouse in 1999. My husband was already in the AF for 10 years. It was helpful, but nothing is better than real life AF experiences over 10 or 20 years. After 911 life in all military services changed.So did the Rules and Social Mores. It is OK and completely normal for Officer spouse and Enlisted to be friends. It OK to hold hands in public when the old school says no open public display of affetctiion. EVEN the officer Wives clubs our Joint Officer and/or Enlisted SPOUSES clubs since many even have MEN on the EXECUTIVE board or as members So read it andtake it all in but KNOW that LIFE and RULEs haver changed alot since this book was written:)"
2,Generic,"This Book was rather generic, the information put out was very broad and could pertain to a Bloodhound or a Coonhound or a mo foin' Pomeranian!! The pictures were the only reason I gave this book any stars at all because the information between these pictures was a big dissapointment. If you really do want good bloodhound information, get ""The New Complete Bloodhound"", it was written by true BH folksThe New Complete Bloodhound"
5,The Navy's Perfect Storm,"This is a superb book about the heroism of a Navy patrol plane crew that goes down in the midst of a raging north Pacific storm, and the men who dare the elements to rescue them. A well know story within naval aviation, it is thrilling to read this riveting account, and it is great to know that many others will have the opportunity to learn this tragic yet uplifting tale. I first heard this story from one of the survivors who visited my squadron many years ago, and it dramaticly affected the way I look at my job. I recommend it to everyone."
5,When you were there...the book takes on a new meaning.,I was a mechanic with VP-9 when PD-02 went down off of the coast of Russia and went on to become a flight engineer with the Golden Eagles and had the opportunity to fly with Ed Caylor on a number of occasions. I knew most of the crew members personally and most all of the other people mentioned in the book. I was very young when we lost 5 of our crew members in the Pacific and the event had a huge impact on me. The book is very accurate and well written. It's great reading for aviation buff's and a must read for anyone that was part of VP-9.
5,A Great Survival Story,"Like many of the previous reviewers, I found out about this book due to a personal connection with VP-9: my father was in the squadron during the time described in this book. But I have to stress that the book stands on its own merits and deserves a wider audience. It's a gripping survival story, which would certainly make a compelling movie. The author provides just the right amount of technical explanation without bogging the story down. And the backstory gives a fascinating glimpse into real life on one of the most important fronts of the Cold War. Highly recommended."
1,A little skeptical,"I almost put this book in my shopping cart but I decided to read the reviews first. What I find odd is that ALL but 1 of the reviewers is ""A READER"" and each of these review entries lacks a designation of a state or any other identifiers. Now, I am having second thoughts because it seems the ratings might have been inflated by the author or other affiliates. Not good."
3,"SOS - Odd, But Peculiar","It's . . . peculiar. In fairly dim light, for a guitar in standard tuning and a really hawk-eyed musician, it makes a good and certainly a compact way to check an almost-in tune situation. As Christmas stocking stuffers - which is what I got them for - just fine."
5,Great deep cuts.,"This alblum, when it came out, was my absolute favorite. I was, and still am, a huge R.E.M. fan from the beginning. This alblum filled a gap for me since I did not have all their single at the time. Also the cover of ""King of the Road"" is not to be missed. If you are a fan of their latest work, check this one out to see where they came from."
4,Couldn't put it down!,"For a first book by a young author, this story really holds your interest! It is a very interesting story about a young married woman and how she deals with tragedy in a very unique way. It is definitely a ""chick book""! It kept my interest throughout and brought about discussion with others who were reading it at the same time at work. I highly recommend reading this book if you like a sad love story that has loads of twists and turns."
5,Beautiful and moving story about returning home,"""This was the way it was with him. In this first moment of homecoming, all the years in between meant nothing. The day he had left, he was a young man and his sisters were young and his brothers alive, and this was the next day, and he and his sisters were old, and all his brothers were dead, and the forty-seven years in between had not happened. He had left home one day, yesterday, and come home today, and the change was too much for him to bear.""This was a moving story of a Nevada sheepherder returning to his home in the Pyrenees of France after 47 years.Easy to read and full of descriptive prose, Robert Laxalt combines in this story the poetry of place with the passion of lost family and friends."
5,A few brave men,"This book is a true story that vividly describes the era of baseball and the scoial climate of race relations in the early 1940's. The Brooklyn Dodgers were the first Major Leauge Baseball team to hire an African American. Branch Rickey of the Dodgers was looking for ""a man strong enough not to fight back"". Jackie Robinson was of course that man and it was known as the ""Great Experiment"". It was tough for Jackie who ws not well recieived by many whites, including his teammates. One teammate was different, he knew he should always do what is right even if everyone around him including family or friends felt differently, that man was Pewee Reese. This book looks at how racism affected many aspects of society and how the strength of one indidual can change many attitudes. There is a variety of mediums used for the illustrations that only enhance the book."
1,Could have been better....,"I would have liked to learn more about the teammates and maybe how things progressed in a positive way over the years, instead of dedicating the entire book to the negative injustice that was prevalent at the time."
3,Book mix-up,"Teammates is a must have book for elementary educators. The only problem I had was with the company (hippo_books) I purchased the book from. I purchased a hardcover book, but was sent a paperback copy. The company did rectify the situation rather quickly when I notified them they had sent the wrong item. They were unable to send the orginal hardcover copy because they said they could not find it in their supply, so they credited my account and there was no charge for the softcover book."
2,Not what I thought it would be,It was recommened by someone who was a Dodger fan. It is more like a childs book. I thought it was for adults.
1,Not Rabbit Friendly,"Seems to aim for the commercial producer. A guide to pet rabbits shouldn't have info on slaughtering methods, dressing the meat and pelts, etc. Care information is outdated."
5,the best,"this is probably one of his best dvd's out there, its just great, he got a great mix of his songs, and watchtower is just amazing on it. Any 1 who does not have this dvd should go out and buy it right now!!!!"
2,blah,"This video is not great for a couple of reasons. First of all the material played is some of DMB's worst in my opinion, with the exception of JTR, Warehouse, Watchtower, Stay, Ants, and Two Step. Second of all the video is far to processed. Filmed by over 25 cameras, it is far over done, and the flashing images and split screens achieve the opposite of their goal, by driving my attention away from the performance, and making me dizzy enough to want to stop watching. Neither the CD nor the DVD are worth getting...I wish I had known that before I bought both...alas."
1,Horrible Editing,"Oh man, I was looking forward to this DVD. I'm a HUGE DMB fan. I love ""Listener Supported"" because it gives you a feeling of being in the audience. But because of HORRIBLE editing, Folsom Field gives you the feeling of being in a blender. Absolutely terrible editing. Could not be more disappointed with this."
2,Bad Sound and Picture!!!,"As always the Dave Matthews Band was great, but the audio and video for this DVD are VERY bad. Sometimes you can hardly hear the music because the screaming is so loud! I was very disapionted because I thought this DVD was going to be great!"
4,give it a chance,"I agree with everybody in that the editing on this DVD is no good. At times it is very distracting. However, the performance is out of this world. I watched the video for the first time expecting the worst b/c the previews were so bad and all the reviews are so bad, so I was pleasantly suprised to see that it was watchable. The DMB really do know how to put on a good show, and I know any fan would dig the hell out of this performance. People just checking out the DMB should start w/ Listener Supported, but if you already have, give this one a try. People with epilepsi should probably watch out though."
3,They tried to hard,"It seems as if this dvd was edited way too much. They pan out and show other pictures when they should just show the freaking concert! It gets annoying after a while. Musically this dvd shows how great Dave Matthews Band is, but the way they put it together is horrible. 1 for editing but 5 for music."
4,"Music Rocks, Camera Work needs Work!","The music in this edition is fabulous. The songs, crowd and venue were just about as energetic as possible. I would have liked the filming to have been edited more like Listener Supported where the musicians are shown a little quicker than just a couple seconds.The DVD is a must buy for any serious DMB fan."
1,I hate the video editing,"Great concert, great song list, crappy editing...Just stick with Listener supported"
2,All you need is love,"This was typical John Lennon. Tongue in cheek, honest and at times in lala land. It did explain some of the Yoko years, if you are interested in a good read of Rock icons, read Eric Clapton, not a must but very much in his own words, and puts all doubt to rest."
2,weak,"this is a scrap book of rejected scribblings, it seems to me. The two interesting bits are where he knocks the other Beatles and refers to Ringo as It's Only Ringo, as though Ringo were actually nasty under his affable exterior. And we learn that John lost his virginity at 15... Now you don't need to read the book."
5,"A book full of ""Walrus"" and ""Lucy""-like Lennon-isms.","Anyone who enjoys Edward Lear will love Lennon's book of nonsense. He masterfully crafts the English language to suit his desires and needs, giving the reader a non-sensical trip into his before-his-time mind. Filled with classic Lennon-isms, Skywriting is a must for any fan of John's. There is something new to be seen every time you pick it up!"
4,Not your Beatles lennon...,"This is a very interesting book, a great insight into the mind of John Lennon. However, if you're looking for a quick read and are not someone who likes to reread passages in search for odd and deeper meaning/perceptions then this book might not be for you. His writing can often come off sounding a little gibberish, or childlike. The short story like poems read more like spoken word with a slight cultural difference in UK English and US English. Also, don't expect this book to be anything like his lyrics from his work with The Beatles, or even most of his solo work; it's not all lovey dovey or give peace a chance.Over all, this is a must have for any true John Lennon fan. ""The Ballad for John and Yoko"" is a beautiful piece of work that shows what the two of them went through to be together, and gives a little insight on how and why The Beatles might have broken up. This book also holds a lot of wonderful drawings done by Lennon."
3,Bluegrass is Best,Ihave listened to Lester and Earl for many years and never heard them this far below par. It must be the tapeing of the show at the time that leaves me waiting for them to kick into second gear and play the way I know they are capable of.I will not buy again if all of the shows are like this one. T W Colton
5,Story Of Friendship and Noment of Truth:,"This is a story of a character named Susan. She has a boyfriend named Jon. She is popular with the young men, and likes to flirt alot. She has a best female friend, but I forgotten her name. Susan nearly destroys her friendship with her best friend.I read this when I was a preteen or early teens, and that was over 17 years ago. I HIGHLY recommend this!"
4,Essential Reading Skills Review,I was not upset when I received this item in the mail. It was still in good condition with no tears or missing pages and little writing in it.
3,"Good stories, but average writing flair.","It's always nice to read uplifting stories of people who are making the most of bad situations or who are making bad places better. However, the writing style is bland. This style makes it difficult to read more than one chapter at a time. I wish the book made more of a statement about how the author thinks that these people and their acts could be applied on a larger scale. Does he propose that there is a solution in the book which would allow government to back out of these areas or are they just nice stories?"
3,"Um, I have dystonia..","I'm delighted he has written about TWO dystonia patients...but I want everyone to know that there are over 300,000 of us out here, and dystonia takes many different forms. Most of us do not die..but it would be wonderful to be able to have a bit of dignity when we go out in public! We're not monsters....in fact, the nastiest part of dystonia is that the people it afflicts are invariably of above average intelligence."
3,"Good Product, just wasn't what I was looking for.","I thought the Rockman guitar ace was a good product, It just wasn't what I was looking for."
4,DVD-Livingston Taylor's Excellent Guitar Lesson,"The title says it all. Livingston is a master finger picker and he shares his perspective.His attitude and capability to instruct is formidable. If you are just starting finger-picking, or you are experienced, this DVD has something for you.The choice of tunes he walks you through are well worth the cost of the disc.I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and return to it frequently."
2,Disappointed,"I was very much looking forward to this Dvd lesson. I had already done two Pete Huttlinger Dvd's on Jim Croce and thought they were terrific. I must say,though, that I was very disappointed. I enjoy Livingston Taylor's music and enthusiasm, but I felt he really fell down on the nuts and bolts of playing his songs. He skips around songs and does not go into detail on how to play them. Some parts he seems to skip all together. It is alot of 'zen' teaching-feeling the music. This is improtant, but first give me the basics. You have to use the tab (which has many mistakes) and just watch him play to figure out alot of the songs. The last song he does not even teach at all, just plays it. This was done back originally in the 90's and maybe they have just learned how to do these better since then, but there is no comparison to the level of teaching you get on the Huttlinger Dvd's. I wish Pete would teach Livingston's songs (along with his brother's). I would be able to learn them much better."
5,Well communicated,"Livingston Taylor is nothing if not passionate. His enthusiasm can be a little over the top, but it holds your attention. This isn't a lesson on the most cutting edge techniques and fretboard pyrotechnics. It's mostly about putting the skills you have (or are about to acquire) into good use. It's about the act of performance and the soul of making music. He goes far beyond, ""put this finger here..."" and shares a great deal of wisdom that you probably won't get from a book. You'll definitely pick up several ""Taylor-isms"" to add to your own playing style as well."
2,NOT 3 SPEED,"Installed the switch in a 3 speed fan and only get one speed. I could have bought the wrong item, but it was a 3 speed fan and this was a 3 speed switch, so naturally I assumed..."
5,Used on hunter,"My hunter switch broke, this replaced it. Note the color order is different, there's a diagram on google. Works fine"
2,Didn't work on my 3 speed Hampton Bay,"I bought this to replace a switch on a 3 speed Hampton Bay ceiling fan. This 4-wire switch looked identical to the original one that failed. I recorded all the wire locations (even checked the wiring on another identical working fan). I also carefully studied wiring diagrams I found online for my fan controller. I made sure to match up the correct power, ground, and capacitor wires to the right holes....turned it on, the motor hummed, but no rotation. Assuming I did something wrong I started swapping wires around...same result, humming but no rotation or nothing at all.I ended up dumping the switch and permanently connecting the wires for lowest speed without a switch. I'm 99% sure that the switch was broken, the other 1% is me doing something wrong thus 2 stars instead of 1. I waited too long so can't return any more."
5,WONDERFUL PLEASURE READING!,"This book takes the reader to Greece in the year 1964, along with Emily Kimbrough and three of her travelling companions. It has several chapters with titles which are stories that illustrate the Greek culture. The rest of the book is simply a delightful travelogue in Emily Kimbrough's usual style. Although the book must be considered a period piece in that the trip described took place nearly 40 years ago, it is nevertheless educational and inspiring. ""Forever Old, Forever New"" is a pleasant companion book, and a great escape!"
3,Questions,Most all scopes have an identifying number on them.That number is missing from most of the scopes I've looked at inall of the listings shown.For example- Is this scope a w6x24x40or is it a tr6x24x40 or is it neither one of theese?
1,Not Very Good,"One song was good, thought there had to be many more!! Wish I hadn't purchased it. Stuck!! Should have paid more attention!!"
3,Pretty Good,The Go-Go's were a alright group that had some good cuts.Our Lips are Sealed&We Got the beat were pretty catchy.for a while it looked as though they might be the female version of The Beach Boys with those happy go lucky songs.but they Lost their Juice.they were good for the 80's but nothing more than that in Hidesight.
5,go go- No No,"Well I love this cd, but I can't see why amazon does not carry it.. Can you buy it in the stores?"
4,Now I can listen to the Go-Gos,"I was a metalhead in the 80s. This condition was caused by being a boy growing up in south Louisiana. If I had dared to admit to listening to a ""girl New Wave band"" I would likely have been beaten up. Now that I'm older and bigger I can readily admit I like them very much. The band was very musically tight, and knew how to write a catchy song. I'll admit that I like the ""hits"" better tnan the other album cuts, but overall a very listenable CD."
4,gogo buy it if your only in it for the fun pop,"The go-go's are known for being the first all american girl band to break it big and many of these tracks are the reason. They consist of the fun pop sound that the go-go's have resorted to. It is missing, however, many of the great tracks off the beauty and the beat release like tonight and skidmarks on my heart. I am also suprised to see beneath the black sky missing which is my favorite song from the band. If you want the roar punky girls I know and love, buy beauty and the beat...if you like the fluffy fun pop sound this is a true gem for your collection...HOW MUCH MORE will keep you sing for days. One bad note..the remix of cool jerk is a complete miss. But I love this CD for road trips...do invest in it."
3,Good condition but not as the original one.,"The keyboard is in very good condition but the image in the actual page doesn't match the one I got. The difference is in the ""Caps Lock"" key backlight. The new one doesn't have this feature so it makes a little bit difficult the process of writing."
1,Incorrect item,"I ordered the keyboard for the Toshiba Satellite A-215 and received this keyboard instead.Contacted the seller and they stated that IF I paid to ship it back they would charge me a re-stocking fee then would reimburse me for the amount remaining. Which after paying for shipping and the re-stock fee would be negligible.I did receive it promptly. But with no shipping invoice. And of course, it was not what I ordered."
2,So so,"I bought the MY FIRST AMAZING DIARY for my son a week ago. He is a 7 year-old. He liked it at the beginning as other software he owned. He mastered it very quickly and easily. It is OK for a regular diary, but it isn't as AMAZING as what we had expected. We experienced technical difficulty while we installed it."
5,Keep kids busy through summer vocation,"This diary software is very attractive to kids. It starts at the beginning level of writing and has many ways to draw kids' attention. Kids can start writing from their familiar persons and stuffs. Because it is a diary, it really works out on a daily basis. My seven-year son love it. Now he starts writing sentence and some stories on daily basis. We highly recommended this software."
4,A reference; not suitable as the first book to read on the topic,"The great purge has too many victims to name, but the author tried to do it anyhow.This certainly seems to be a great reference but it simply should not read by those who do not know the hundreds of minor political characters who, as a general rule, are introduced only in the paragraph where they fall into the purge: 'XXXXX, a general who won the battle of ABC in PQR, was shot only two days after receiving the Order of Lenin.' It simply doesn't illuminate."
5,Staggering piece of Work..Must read for fledging historians!,"Yes, I know the author is a conservative.All the figures in this book may be subject to debate, but no one can doubt the massive paranoia of the Soviet leader during the 1930's, as described here. The whole workings of a police state are right here,including the KGB chiefs who, after doing their dirty work, would then disappear. For pure sinister deviousness, this book is in a class by itself. ""Enemies of the people"" could be anywhere,and even children were encouraged to ""report"" on their parents. The fact is that Soviet Russia in the 1930's was much more ruthless to it's own (so-called ""counter-revolutionaries)citizens than Germany, which was a much more technologically advanced nation,and with a much lower poverty level. The infamous Moscow Trials were only a tiny fraction of the whole mess.A great read!!"
4,it is a great book it puts joesph stalin in line with hitler,he is the evil man of the century! he killed 18 million christians and 10 million ukrainians
5,The Master Historian.,"Let me begin by saying that Robert Conquest is an absolutely brilliant writer and scholar. I'd classify him as being at the top of our era's historians; which would put him alongside men like Anthony Beevor and Paul Johnson. I read this book about 10 years ago but studied it again this week. It is a concise account of one of the most horrific periods in the history of mankind. Few books will have the unexpected outcome of making you so grateful to live in the present age. Conquest is meticulous in his telling of the Yagoda/Yeshov/Beria schinas, and behind them all we find Stalin willfully exterminating his countrymen and consolidating his rule. No book that I've read has given a more thorough or readable accounting. I would give it 10 stars if I could. My only regret is that no photos were included. The rare photos offered in this year's ""Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar"" really accentuated the text."
4,VERY Heavy,".....both literally and figuratively. When I purchased this book, I thought it was going to be a narrative of life during the purges and at the camps, a la Shalamov or Bardach.Instead, it is actually a scholarly work with incredible detail regarding the politics and behind the scenes happenings during those terrible times. As such, it was an incredible piece of work, possibly the best of its type. If this is what you are seeking, get it because you will find none better. You won't breeze through it, but you will feel very educated when you finish it."
3,Ultimately disappointing,"I was a huge fan of Renzo and Royler's book, and was very much anticipating Royce's addition to the Gracie library. What I found was that other than the grappling situations with no weapons, the techniques are mildly effective at best. Most of the defenses rely on force vs. force blocks, which isn't exactly the greatest way to defend against an attack from a larger opponent. Moreover, the knife defenses covered in the book were flat out dangerous (to the DEFENDER). Overall, I firmly believe that this book does have something to offer, but a better choice would be Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, by Renzo and Royler Gracie."
2,Caution !,"I agree with the people who say this book might get you hurt. The techniques to me look too dangerous. There is one picture that shows a gun being pulled, and the next picture, the defender has the gun (voila !!). No picture intermediate to that explains HOW the defender got the bad guy's gun. I find this book actually kind of funny. If you really want effective self defense, sign up for krav maga in your area. Brazilian jujitsu is a SPORT martial art, not a street martial art. Do you want to take a rabbit rifle to a bear hunt ? Me either. Also, no real knife attacker will make it so easy that you can do the defenses in this book. He already has your ""defenses"" thought through, and how he will answer them. Real knife fighers do feints and don't let you see the knife, or they will draw you one way and slash back. This book answer none of those questions, as far as I am concerned."
1,Brazilian Jiujitsu should be left in the ring,Most of theses techniques will get you hurt..(how to remove a hand from your throat...do it like royce if you want the attacker to take your windpipe with him)..The gracie techniques should be left in the ring...if you want to learn to wrestle with rules study brazilian jiujitsu..if you want to survive go elsewhere
2,How to get yourself killed fast on the street,"If you want a sport art - study BJJ. If you want the best in self defense study something else. Just because a guy is a FORMER champ in the UFC doesn't mean he knows jack about what it takes to survive a violent ambush, by multiple armed attackers.BJJ will get you killed very very quickly in any multiple opponent scenario.The Gracies are amazing athletes and amazing competitors. the world of martial arts owes them a a lot. Unfortunately they sell their system as the greatest thing since sliced bread even to cops and soldiers. That's just plain nuts!It shows that marketing and money is key - and saving lives is second place."
3,I expected so much more!,"Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) has such a rich history of applied combatives yet this beautiful and extremely well produced book does not deliver techniques or strategies that compare to the proven history of BJJ.There is little in this book that you won't learn in your first year of almost any selfdefense school's instruction. The flavor that sets BJJ apart from the pack is not present.I strongly suggest getting a different BJJ book, even a different Royce Gracie BJJ book . . . trust me, you will be much happier."
3,Not for the real world,"I know, I know, all you jiu jitsu lovers out there probably love the information in this book. I have worked in law enforcement and teach military members how to fight in real combat situations. I have practiced Judo and Jiu Jitsu for a long time. One of my instructors is a bronze medalist in Judo and is one of the finest Jiu Jitsu masters. I have worked in person with students of the ground fighting masters. These men are in fantastic shape. The techniques shown in this book can get you killed. If you get involved with a knife wielding maniac who feels no pain and you try most of the stuff in this book it will prove ineffective in most cases. I am sorry but I must tell the truth. If you like Jiu-Jitsu then practice the atemi (strikes) until you can deal with a raging fighter with a weapon. You will not get the locks and grapples to work against a knife moving at high speed. Check out some of the Close Combat masters books who have been in actual battle. Good luck, JR"
1,A rip-off,"Very small and very few noodles, very little resin; also the mushrooms are 'paper'.....Don't waste your money, seller apparently is not concerned with dissatisfaction!"
4,Rainbow Six Covert Operations,"I my opinion I think this game is great. One of the good things is that it doesnt need the original rainbow six to be installed to run. It has some pretty good realism and graphics are good too. With 9 new levels, it will keep most people who are on HARD dificulty with something to do."
2,Singe player was a joke!,"there are only three new missions for single player, the training missions were very short, and other than multiplayer it was not worth the cost!"
1,Covert Ops - A Joke,"This is the worst buy you could make. Look at the price of the game and ask yourself if the cost is worth 3 missions. That's right, this game ends after the third mission. Save your money - do not buy this game."
5,Best game in the world.Except for..........,"This game is one of the best games I've ever payed.But, there are only three levels.Also there are less weopons.There are two disc, but one is a training disc.All it has you do is read and take test.If you stick to the mission disc the game is perfectly fine.Besides the training disc and there only being three levels it is the bet game ever."
2,I do not recomend it unless...,"I was extremelky disspointed on the new r6 game. It is an exact copy of Rogue Spear just about 20 bucks less and less missions. I started playing it last night and after about 2.5 hours of playtime i was done ( note; i created my own plans). No you didnt mis read ONLY about 2 AND A HALF HOURS OF PLAYTIME. THe only good thing about the game is the training cd but unles u r doing a shcool report or are specially interested in the background of your game it helps otherwise its like the previews at the movies, they're interesting but u would get bored of feature length previews. In my opinion you are better off buying ROgue SPear and Urban Ops; a little expensier option but u get more bang for the buck. So dont buy it unles u have to do a school report on Counter-terrorism or you are just getting aqcuainted with the R6 series for the rest of us don't."
5,Covert Ops essentials,"Another Game from the popular series ainbow 6. This game puts you in control of a counter terrorits group Rainbow 6. The realism of this game ads to the pros. It has a one shot one kill feel to the game wich ads to the supense not like past other shooter games.It has a wide rage of weapons camo and body armour to choose from. The game includs 2 discs. The first is a training disc where you watch other CT groups in action and what to do in a cetain scenario. The second is a mission disc where play through 7 training missions and 3 campaign missions. I thought there shold have bben more missions like in Rogue Spear (Another hit R6 game). Game also includes an over the internet game play with zone, mplayer or LAN. Covert Ops was intended to be for people who never played a R6 game before, so this game would introduce them to the series. All in all this game is great for beginners and vertens of the R6 series!"
4,The Review.( I can't think of an name),"Tiberian Sun. Wow. W-O-W.Well, this is strategy game. Ach... how can I start the review?!This is a good RTS. You take the side of a commander fighting for the Brotherhood of Nod (Nod) or the Global Defense Initiation (GDI)... I think that stands for GDI.The two sides are different, and graphics are pretty good. TS is a deep game, and you have to play it for a long time to find out each side's strengths and weaknesses.One thing that needs some 'repairing' is the skirmish AI. It's not that smart, and it1.doesn't need to explore2. MONEYWell, I'm a newbie to good reviews, so it's bye......For now... muahaha"
4,Not Quite Is Much Fun As The Old Red Alert-But Nice,"I've always been a fan of the Command & Conquer line of games. I really like the Older Red Alert series of C&C games, and being slightly less aggressive than many of my friends, I tend to like to built and play my own maps. That said. I like this game. Even though they tried to make the terrain more real and changed the engine some, I found it fun to play. I still like Red Alert one best, but this game will really pull you in. Money well spent!!"
4,Good economical scope,I wanted this scope to fit my stainless steel Mini 14. It works fine and matches the stainless finish of the rifle.
2,"Westinghouse #66962 6"" White Wall Lantern",base of light..to small...i bought 5 of these lights...base just covers 3 1/2 inch hole..no extra room
4,One more I Spy to our collection,This was a gift for my 5 year old son. He loves anything I Spy. We have pretty much every book and our computer library is growing as well this is our forth game. I figured that I would get this one for him it looked different and the suggested age was closer then the others we have. What I found out is he can defiantly do this one by himself and in comparison to the other games we have it is easier then his other I Spy games that we have which is fine he loves it none the less. We love the I Spy products keep them coming!!
2,Doesn't work if you have Windows 7,"Doesn't work if you have Windows 7... They should say that on the original info page. I can play it on my husband's laptop that has Vista (so it wasn't a total waste of money), but I can't play it on my newer laptop that has Windows 7. Something about it not being 64-bit, or something like that. Funny though, I own all of the other computer I Spy games, and they all work with Windows 7, but just not this one."
1,Not Mac OSX,"Unlike most all mac software these days, this program is not OSX. It is formatted for System 9 from years ago, so a waste of money for me."
1,Won't Install On Windows 7,We bought my Granddaughter a new HP Notebook at Wal Mart this past weekend I am setting it up for her so she will have some games to play when she opens it on Christmas Morning. Windows 7 gives me an x86 error and won't install the game. I should return it but for price paid it's not worth the trouble.
2,Won't work with XP,Be wary because this software will not work with Windows XP. I Spy Junior and I Spy Spooky Mansion will not work either. I looked EVERYWHERE on the net for troubleshooting help and nada!
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this game for my grandchildren and it said it was XP windows acceptable, but could not get this game to install. These are excellent games for all ages and the company needs to update them for XP and 7 windows. I have two games that will work on my XP,I Spy Treasure Hunt and I Spy Spooky Mansion."
1,I Spy School Days-big bore,"My six year old great nephew completed all of the activities within two hours. He was moderately interested in the beginning and bored by the time he finished. I watched as he played, and thought they were boring, too."
3,Can't find 12th ladybug!,"I really like this game but I am annoyed that I can't find the last ladybug in the find me game. I can find no game hint support sites either. Has anyone else had this problem? Is it a bug (ha ha) in the program? I have spent weeks looking but always find the ones I've already found. Can anyone out there help me? I am not a child, but my daughter can't find it either. Apparantly the game will not finish until all bugs are found because I have found all the treasures. Does this game not have more than one complete game to play? I thought it had 3 like treasure hunt.Thanks,"
1,"Deceptive, Not Really Compatible With Windows XP","Although this product claims to be XP-compatible, it doesn't really work unless you first change your system settings to run in Windows 98 compatibility mode, and set virtual memory settings back to 200MB. Even though the outer box says Windows XP, copyright dates inside the jewel case make it obvious this is really pre-XP software that has not been updated.Since we use our computer for other things besides games, the only way my son can play is to wait for 5-10 minutes' worth of switching to an admin user account, changing memory settings, then restarting the computer. When he finishes, we have to put the memory settings back again so we can use the computer for other things."
1,Avoid at all costs,"I agree with the reviewer who urges you to stay away from this and other Scholastic products if you run Windows XP. I received School Days and Spooky Mansion today but can't get either to run on XP, even though I am generally quite adept at working with computers. I will never buy another product from this company, even if it works well on XP. These products say they work with ""Windows 95, 98, 2000 or later."" Don't believe it."
3,CUCA almost at their best,"While not as good as thier first Album (which is out of print), ""TU CUCA MADRE"" follows in the fine CUCA tradition. The rythem and lyrics are once again great. Over all a fine piece of audio art to be enjoyed by all music lovers, even if you can't understand spanish."
4,The Visual Dictionary of Star Wars,"I bought this book and the complete guide for the entire saga. I was more impressed with this book than the other. This book was missing atleast the one character I was looking for Niem (Sullustan) that flew the Falcon with Lando in 6. So I looked him up on the internet and found his info readily availble on some star wars website. I was hoping that they would atleast list the name and race for ever character shown, but they don't."
3,star wars visual dictionary ep 4-6,it was very interesting but to short and more of a talk piece than a useable resource manual
1,Excellent book!,"This book was just what we needed. My five-year-old son has developed a sudden interest for Star Wars, and since he's too young to watch the films, this book was perfect for him. Excellent pictures, everything is well explained, all the major points of interest are covered."
5,The creativity was great!!,"David West Reynolds, is a genuis on writing these books. They are great books. Why? Because of the creativity and cleverness. He didn't just draw anything, nope. He had to save up and actually build a light saber. And he didn't just go rambling along about the obvios stuff, nope. He gave you stuff like What is that ammo on Chewbaccas banoleir? Yep, a genuis he is."
5,A long time ago in a galaxy far far away....,"STAR WARS the Visual Dictionary! This great book features some amazing facts about Star Wars Episodes IV, V, and VI and I love it! It has details about all of the major characters and a lot of minor characters ranging form Luke Skywalker, to Princess Leia Organa, to the Rancor, to the slave girl in Jabba's Palace. This book has info on the Stormtroopers, C-3PO, Yoda, and many more. YOU WILL LOVE IT!"
5,"The Visual Dictionary of Star Wars, Episodes IV, V & VI",Great pictures and information about characters.
4,"Excellent visual reference, some explanations questionable.","Although it has great visuals, some captions are not to be believed. Lots of technobabble on the blasters page and the lightsabre page has some statements that are contradictory to canon. Overall, it is worth having for excellent visual references, but keep in mind that it has a diluted boundary between canon and apocrypha. (Especially remember that the lightsabre cutaway is Dr. Reynold's design, it is not by definition what a real sabre would look like inside.)"
5,"Covers episodes IV, V, VI","OK, I'll admit -- even as the mom, I find this book interesting. I got it as an incentive for my son to work hard, and he LOVES it and can't stop poring over it -- mealtime, car rides, waiting around -- he just absorbs this book.But as a mom -- the photos and descriptions are awesome! They pull in backstory and use good vocabulary and ...... this is a great book."
5,"Enjoyable,excellent,and very detailed!","I loved how the Star Wars book explained every single detail of whatever it was talking about! And the pictures were outstanding!! It was a book to remember, and love for generations to come!!I personally love the book, and I think whom ever looks at it will see the same beauty I saw in the book."
4,"Attention keeper, with some graphic scenes.","Daughters of the House, by Michele Roberts, is a novel set in post World War II England and France. The two main characters, Therese and Leonie, first identified as cousins, later renamed another relation, live in the same house in France. This book depicts typical childhood in France. However, some scenes described are graphic and not recommended for younger readers. This book also describes children growing up in Catholicism. Roberts is very critical of Catholicism due to childhood experiences with the Church. This book kept my attention, however, her use of flashback and media res can be confusing. If you can handle the language, criticism of Catholicism, and the graphic scenes, this is the book for you."
3,The tattoo says it all,"The main reason I bought this album was to have something for the Avett Brothers to sign at Coachella. That was the deal, you buy, they sign. I would say it was a great investment as my wife and I have fell in love with each other and then this album.She likes the sentimental version of Swept Away and I like the traditional. Both tracks have become ""our song"" as we listened to it many many times over as we started our relationship.Overall this is a very good album though it doesn't quite measure up to Emotionalism. It will always hold a special place for me as I recall the day I purchased it and the many times it has been played.P.S. The title of the review references the tattoo on my left side of my chest."
1,Bad Karaoke,"It's like paying $15 to listen to karaoke in a bar full of drunks. The picking is good (just like karaoke) but the Avetts insist on opening their mouths and trying to sing (just like drunks at a karaoke bar). One of the brothers even screws his voice up on purpose just to make the bad worse.If you are in to this stuff, I would recommend that you spend the $15 at the nearest karaoke bar, at least then you get some beer out of it."
4,Fun Find,"I typically reveiw books, not music, but I saw The Avett Brothers at Merlefest last weekend, and I was blown away (or should I say swept away?). They were by far the best and most memorable of the relatively unknown performers I saw at the festival. Their talent, virtuosity and sheer exuberance is hard to beat.Mignonette contains some great songs. Swept Away, A Gift for Melody Anne, and Salvation Song are standouts. Others are good, though they don't quite rise to the level of great. There is some weirdness with sound effects and background talking on the album--the guys must have gotten a bit giddy in the recording studio.Overall, I haven't felt so enamored of a group since I discovered the Jayhawks. Looking for good things to come from The Avett Brothers."
5,Tracy is Tops!,Brian Tracy is the epitomy of welath building and this publication takes the cake. Tracy simplifies money making and wealth building. The only thing missing is a more step-by-step approach such as is MILLIONAIRE 101. I highly recommend this book but only if you are going to read it and follow Tracy's plan. Emmanuel Sarmiento millionaire101.net
5,Firehouse Dog,"It's a very good movie. A movie the family can watch together. I enjoyed it just as much as my grandkids. A Dad, a Son, a dog with a little humor and a little drama. What more do you need."
5,Great movie,Good family movie. Bought for grand daughter. She is 6 and she relly enjoyed it.. .. .. .. .. ..
5,Great Movie,We liked this movie so much we ended up buying a dog just like it. as a matter of fact the dogs in this movie are my dogs uncles.
5,Firehouse Dog,"I saw this movie last week. I absolutely loved it!! This is why I wanted to buy it to own it. I recommend it to anybody, especially dog lovers. A cute and very entertaining clean show to watch. Thank you."
5,FUN & lighhearted for all ages,"I purchased Firehouse Dog through Amazon because it is our favorite movie. Rexxx who is Dewy is the most enteratining fun-loving dog that everyone wishes they had for a pet. If you are a dog lover or any animal lover this is the movie for you. It's for all ages and we are always asked to ""play firehouse dog."" You will embrace this movie full of action, fun, heart warming scenes between a dog and boy and a true hero.Thank you Amazon, we couldn't find this movie anywhere except for on your web page."
1,IT DONT WORK,ITS THE DVD IT DOES NOT PLAY IT SKIPS AND FREEZES IT'S LIKE A KID PLKAYED IT ALL THE TIME IT WILL NOT PLAY IT SAT DOWN TO WATCH IT AND IT WOULD NOT PLAY I WILL NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THAT COMPANY AGAIN IT'S REALLY BAD
3,GOOD FAMILY FRIENDLY COMEDY!,"OK my friends here at Amazon, please don't come down on me too hard for liking this fairly fun, if predictable comedy. It's not going to win any awards and it doesn't break any new ground, but over all, I enjoyed this film. There are some corny jokes that fall flat, but most of it works. This is a fantasy film, so be prepared to just let all credibility go. It's cute, harmless and better than most of these types of pictures. Dog lovers should enjoy the credit role at the end."
3,Pretty good movie-I would not take real young children to it though....,"Director: Todd Holland.Starring: Josh Hutcherson, Bruce Greenwood, Steven Culp, Bill Nunn.Old-fashioned family film - which is a good and a bad thing. Good in that it's a wholesome, good-natured kids movie; bad in that the kids are used to something much more these days.When Rex becomes the firehouse mascot, it keeps the fire fighters' morale high as their station is threatened with closure. Okay, so it might rely on canine bodily function gags to get most of the laughs (Rex snores, farts, burps and poos in the stew), but Firehouse Dog is not entirely a comedy. There's a sizable subplot that deals with mysterious arson."
2,"Not hot (but not bad, either)","Firehouse Dog is one of those movies that came and went pretty quickly in theaters, greeted by mixed reviews.On DVD, it's watchable granted you aren't expecting a whole lot. It's a trifle to be sure, but the dog is cute and while there is not much in the way of a ""boy and his dog"" story, the movie is cute and moves a long at a decent (if clunky) pace.Staci Layne Wilson"
5,Ter4,This story is for children and adults as well. My 2 and 3 yr old grandchildren loved it. My husband and I have seen it twice. Good lessons in making sacrafices and relationships between father and son and dog and owner. Very intertaining and humourous.
5,Awesome for families with young kids!,My family loves this movie. We have 2 little boys - 4 and 2. We watch it over and over and over again. The story line is simple to follow but interesting enough to keep even my attention.
5,Firehouse Dog,It is nice to sit down and watch a movie that you can have a laugh to. It is a great movie even the grand kids enjoyed it very much.Great movie and story line.Sharron
5,A gripping travel odyssey,"Locked Passion of a Free Spirit was a wonderful surprise. Not only was it an incredibly honest memoir; a story of apertheid struggle, romance, and dreams. It was also a 5 year travel log in which you felt you were traveling right next to the author.Fabiola's writing style is free and easy and I found myself back in time witnessing all the adventure, sexual encounters, heartbreak, and drama.I would recommend this book highly and I can't wait for Fabila Pon to write another one."
4,An engrossing story.,"I was captivated by this diary-like story that at times was sad, funny and even frightening. I enjoyed reading it and found it to be honest, frank and courageously written."
4,Adventure on the High Seas,"This book kept me up at night turning pages...adventure, exotic locales, sex, pretty young women and the men who (try to) love them.Fabiola Pon has a way with words!"
3,"good show, bad deal",The show is addictive. But dont get it from this seller if you want to watch it on an american dvd player. The seller claims it is region 1 but its actually region 3 so i can only watch it on my computer.
5,a story that builds on itself...,"... in the same manner as ""The House That Jack Built."" Great fun to read aloud. Grandpa kicks off the plot by buying Jesse a pair of shoes, which of course, need a pair of socks to go with them...and soon the whole extended family is pitching in to buy something ""to go with the shoes from Grandpa."" Nice, warm illustrations and the rollicking text combine to make a very pleasant reading experience. Enjoy!"
3,Nice,"This piece was amazingly beautiful, but like most glass, it's fragile and a portion of the ring broke off after only a few wearings (apparently it hit against a checkout counter). Not sure why there is a gap in the bottom of the ring, but may have contributed."
5,Small Rain,The book arrived timely and in very good condition - better than I espected. The seller was very forthright and careful about the rating and the price was very fair. This book is especially valued because it has so many childhood memories connected to it.
5,nice to have,"cheap and durable, you can see how much bullets you got left...Taito from Panama rep of Panama"
4,"Sure, I'd Like Seconds","The Hot Soup mix continues to evolve. Sort of a cross between The Chenille Sisters and Herdman, Hills and Mangsen, Hot Soup is usually classified as ""folk."" But that doesn't do justice to the breadth and depth of the material on this, their second album. Especially nice here are ""A Much Better View of the Moon"" and ""Sunrise on Carawan Hill,"" two beautifully rendered ballads. The album also gives a hint of the silly side they demonstrate in performance with a parody of a classic Tom Paxton song. The album is a good introduction to a talented group of solo artists who combine to make magic. Enjoy the album and then go see them live."
5,more great sounds,"I have enjoyed Hot Soup for many years. Since I no longer get to see them live, I especially enjoy it when they release a new album"
4,Trio's big hit!,"Hot Soup is a great group! I had a chance to hear them at the first concert to introduce their new record ""Soup Happens"". Entertaining, singable and every song a winner."
1,Cheap product not good,"horrible, they ripped the first time i tried them in practice and they come undone easily.do not buy"
3,its okay,good receiving gloves and holds on to the ball good but the top of the glove rips easily but its still good
4,Top Ace Review,"Hi Mike, wherever you are. Your book was wonderful! I'm looking forward to reading your next one. I'll tell all my friends. In anticipation of your next book."
4,Unique Story,"The only bad thing about this story is that it was over. It starts out as four friends going on a fishing trip and finishes with a great twist. Acid Rain, German Army, Hitler and the mystery of the Bermuda Triangle are all tied together. What an imaginative story. Great escape reading."
1,"Disappointing, at times even amateurish","The title promises ""the inside story,"" but most of this book appears to have been stitched together from newspaper reports. I kept looking for new material or fresh insights, but found very little. One of the themes is that the emergence of Internet-based investors' discussion groups has made the world a less safe place for ordinary shareholders. She doesn't present a convincing argument, however. After all, stock scams have always been with us."
3,5 stars is going a little overboard,"I really enjoy this cd, but I think 5 stars may mislead a lot of people (especially if your exposure to Rowan is just Old and In the Way). Other reviews are accurate in terms of drug-hippie mexicali influence. Also should point out that that this album is partially dedicated to the ""blue yodeler"", Jimmie Rogers so if you are looking for some more contemporary yodeling influenced music, this has quite a bit of that, as well as some great mexican ""ayeyieyie's"" and so forth...two styles of singing that this reviewer can't find enough of. But buyers should be aware that the live tracks on this album are really quite bad (or that fiddle player is really out of tune). One of the tracks is Panama Red, so if you are looking for a polished version of that song, this album doesn't have it."
5,Bushnell Sportman 3X9X40,"Got this with a H&R Handi-rifle in 30-30 AI. It is clear and bright and these old eyes just love the heavy crosshairs. I see it is around a 75 to 100 scope,it is a good one for that price range.Going to buy at least 1or 2 more.Have used it all hunting season with no problems. Later Tom"
5,For the dedicated linguist and/or verbal Latinist,The source for understanding what we know concerning the pronunciation of classical Latin. An aid to teaching the meters of poetry as well as the conversations of well-spoken Romans.
3,i like,PROPER pronunciation of latin is important since ecleseastical latin is mispronounced from its predisesor
3,poor compared to the Bali Stretch Brief,"the quality of the cotton does not begin to compare to the quality of the Bali cotton, similarly for the elastic...."
5,High quality from Vanity Fair,"I prefer Vanity Fair over all other companies for underwear. Their products are the most comfortable, fit the best, and hold up through numerous washings."
4,Bought for a .22 Mag and ended up on my 45-70 brush rifle,well what can I say - it's not as bright as my Nikon's but a fraction of the cost - DUH - designed for a .22 but still working well with my 45-70 lever action that kicks like an Army Mule - being a brush gun when it goes South I'll just use the open sights - still it amazes me every time I use it.
2,An important topic treated too lightly,"Really, IT is facing a big transformation from cost center through service provider to (hopefully) business partner. However, this one ends up with some interesting points here, some good concepts there (more than half are quotes from famous schalors such as Porter), and followed by some cases description (it's not qualified as study). I suggest authors should fit the content into one article and save both our time and money.So the bottom line: For those who could implement the concepts already, this book provides no add value; for those who couldn't, this book can't help you, either."
5,Love this mascara!,"Trucco In Focus Mascara is the best I have found anywhere. It is gentle enough for sensitive skin types like me, and can easily be worn with contact lenses. I do not get an allergic reaction to this product. It is NOT gloppy, like so many other brands."
2,NOT the Quolity I expected,"I have used several different scopes over my many years of hunting and shooting. I have other Tasco scopes and are somewhat pleased with them. However, this scope IS NOT the of quolity I expected. The adjustment towers are not centered or straight in the housing and they are NOT crisp. I didnt expect the optics to be crystal clear at 40 power, but it is well below what I feel is good. I would reccomend to buy a different brand in the same power settings even if they cost more."
1,The worst riflescope I've ever had,"The worst riflescope I ever had, definitely quality has a Price and this is a cheap one. You can have a relative good view among 10x to 18x; with more zoom the image looks cloudy and if the scope is not perfectly aligned you can't see more than a cloudy light"
1,um wth,wrong reticle moa dot USUALLY consists of more than ONE DOT most people like moa dots better than mil dots for the simplicity the product description is not as descriptive as should be
4,Galco,"This is a high quality product, meant for professional use. This brand came highly recommended from a friend and I'm glad I followed his advice. The construction is top notch. The only gripe I have so far is that I wish I would have purchased the model with the hinge that allows the holster to rotate a few degrees. This version is fixed and can be a little uncomfortable when sitting down. Nothing an adjustment can't fix. Also, the high grade leather is tough to break in. The directions state that there is a product available to assist in the break in time."
5,More of Hesse&#65533;s beautiful spirituality,"Not one review of this book! Incredible, you don't know what you're missing if you have not read this author. This is not one of the most recognized works of the Nobel prize author (my personal favorite), but it has everything of what made their other novels so remarkable: the beautiful and deep description of his characters' thoughts and emotions.This edition contains three stories: ""Child's soul"", ""Klein and Wagner"" and ""Klinsor's last summer"" The first one succeeds in showing how intense a child's feelings can be, the happiness and sadness that can be reached while being so young, how a small mistake can trigger the biggest of fears... Klein and Wagner, for me the best one of this book. And ""Klingsor's last summer"" the story of an artist who is dying, while reading this you become Klingsor...I wonder how could Hesse succeed to such degree in portraying thoughts and feelings, no other existentialist author I've read so far reached this complexity."
4,Pyramid Truing Stand,"I gave this a 4 star rating because of price vs quality. This stand is not the best stand out there, but, if you are a part timer bicycle mechanic then this stand will definitely get the alignment job done. When fine tuning and adjusting indicator screws the brackets would flex, therefore not as rigid as I would have liked. Once everything is adjusted though, you will be able to true wheel as good as any high quality truing stand. I couldn't find a better priced truing stand."
3,truing stand,"The stand has a stable base for holding the wheel, but the truing arm which the adjusters are screwed into is made from plastic. i expected it to be made of steel bar similiar to what my freinds is like. hopefully it'll be fine."
3,truing stand,I have this truing stand it works ok but.Its not the best to use.I going to get the Park truing stand it cost more but you also get what you pay for too.
5,A Companion to the Metaphysical Bible Dictionary,"For the metaphysical Bible student, two books are essential: Unity's Metaphysical Bible Dictionary and The Revealing Word. Whereas the Dictionary gives the metaphysical meaning of the names and geographical locations in the Bible, The Revealing Word provides the metaphysical meaning for concepts, words, animals, characteristics, and objects. It is an invaluable companion to the Dictionary. Want to get excited over the Bible? Purchase these two books and settle in for years of fascinating study. Ministers, these are excellent resources for adding depth to your sermons. The Scriptures come alive in ways not afforded by the traditional surface exegesis!"
5,A book of blessings,This opened my eyes to a new meaning of words and deciphering their meaning. What a positive way to communicate with a new profound meaning!
2,Great toaster until it broke.,"Liked the style, ease of use and settings. Then just after a little over a year of use in a two adult family it broke. The bread would not stay down. Being the inquisitive type I decided to take it apart to see if I could fix it and found that the little catch that holds the bread down was a small plastic tab that would have had to be replaced so... into the garbage it went. In the old days could get a toaster free from most banks (when you opened a new account) and it would last for years. Seems like technology is going backward in toasting."
5,pleasantly surprised,"Wasn't expecting much. Got it because of the price. It's an excellent little toaster, browns evenly."
3,Toaster,"The one I got was reconditioned, I don't know what that means but this and my old toaster and the one I bought after this burn the seeds on my 5 grain bread."
4,Settings are a bit off,"I like it, it works, but it browns everything on setting 2 of 10. So if you like things only toasted a little, you may not want to purchase this, or just watch it and 'cancel' it early. The metal parts around the top get very hot, so use the extra lift it provides!! The cord is very short, it was not a problem for my kitchen but may be an issue for others. So far so good for me. - it toasts!!"
2,Might be good for regular rifles but not a high power springer,"For those of you who don't know this, a high power spring piston air rifle generates much more destructive recoil than a powder powered bullet. The spring's back and forth recoil destroys all but the best built scopes. My RWS 52 model had this scope on it for a couple of years, and about 1000 pellets, before it destroyed the scope, by which I mean it literally shook the rear lens out of the scope. I have never really been happy with the scope so I am not too sad to see it go. It never really focused well and although it was functional, it never really compared with comparably priced scopes made by Leapers. Just thought that you ought to know that you should keep it on a light recoil gun if you buy it all."
4,another westcoast banger,this album is pretty tight.If you like westcoast hiphop then this album if for you.
4,My Impression of the beauty Bible,"I am a teenage girl and got the beauty bible about 2 years ago. I found it helped me endlessly especially the make-up sections. However some artists, which they quoted, contradicted each other in minor areas such as, whether to apply foundation or concealer first etc. This is a little confusing but apart from that I love it! I read it every night. However some of the items are unavailable! like christoian dior lip gloss bon bon, which is supposed to be divine! I adore the book though it has helped me through thick and thin!"
1,Way too much drag,I was very excited about Andis new CeramicEdge blade but I must say I thought it was terrible!I oiled it/sprayed it/did all I could...but it didn't cut well at all.It pulled on the dogs hair instead of cutting it...way too much drag.Tried it on a couple different dogs but had to send it back.
4,Good blade and awesome delivery experience,"I have been using this blade, which i got along with andis clipper. Unfortunately the same fell down and broke. I purchase the new blade and yet to start using it. However, i'm writing this review to comment on the delivery experience, with aramex, which was awesome. I'm sure the blade is also going to perform nicely. Thanx"
4,good,"Arrived earlier than expected. Ordered this as a back-up for when my Andis clippers heat up and I'm able to change the other blade with this one. CeramicEdge is supposed to be better, but I don't really know the difference."
2,Save the xtra,"Save the extra money for a ceramic blade, they dont cut nearly as good as the regular stainless blades and heat up just as quickly"
3,Not what I expected,"I expected this blade to run cooler, but instead it runs the same us one with a lower price. After one use it makes more noise then my dog cares for. I purchase this blade hoping that I would be able to use the two blades I have and be able to clip my dog cooler and faster."
2,Early 80's Synth music,"If you're a fan of early 80's synthesizer based music, you'll probably enjoy this album. 'Mexican Radio', 'Spyworld', and 'On Interstate 15' are good. The lyrics are quirky and interesting. Unfortunately, for me, there's too much drum machine and not enough guitar."
3,It screams 80's,"I first heard Mexican Radio as a young teenager sitting in a cold and rainy council house in Manchester, England. 'What the hell is this?' I thought then. This song is increadibly catchy, and I can see why the fan who has heard it 1000 times goes back to it. Stan disproves the old saying that you can't sing with an accent. If you're doing a road trip across the southern states, then put this in your CD along with some Talking Heads and The Doors."
2,"Quirky, but not satisfying","A typical example of the quirky electronic music the 80's seems to have been dominated by; the difference this time is the talent of lyricist and lead singer Stan Ridgway, whose bizarre little stories almost rise above the drum machines and repetitive electronica. I say almost because Ridgway is much more successful at getting his tales across on his solo works then this more than occasionally discordant CD. There are some good tunes here, particularly the insanely catchy ""Mexican Radio"" (""I wish I was in Tijuana, eating barbecued iguana"" That is a great line!) and the title track, a fever dream trip to a very wild west. I find Ridgway's solo material more mature and interesting; unless you really wanted to hear ""Mexican Radio"" and his early work I would skip this one."
3,Good... but not buyable,"I had the ""45"" if anyone even still knows what that is, a single of ""Mexican Radio"" back in the 80's and after hearing it on the radio the other day, I looked here and saw where you could listen to all the others songs if only for a moment. All I can is- WOW! How did this band crank out suck a kick @ss song compared to the rest of other music on the alblum?! I mean my god their bad. I suppose they grow on you if you forced yourself to listen to it enough times, and Im sure others will disagree harkening back to a better time, better music argument. Sorry, the rest of the track suckx. WOV must have just been another One-Hit-Wonder (despite 9 alblums??!!)."
4,"Surreal Mexicans, cowpokes, and factory workers","""Mexican Radio"" is one of my all-time favorite songs, I must've heard it a 1000 times and it still hits me fresh. ""Factory,"" ""Call of the West,"" ""Lost Weekend,"" ""Spy World"" and ""On Interstate 15"" are the other standouts, and they are ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL for any self-respecting pop fan.The whole record has an eerie mood that's quite timeless--full of cheesy sounds and surreal narratives at every turn, glued together by a bizzare underlying humor. In fact, on the strength of this one record, Stan Ridgway was recruited by Francis Ford Coppola to collaborate with Stewart Copeland on the fantastic soundtrack for ""Rumble Fish."""
4,My God This Is Depressing,"I bought this album after falling in love with Mexican Radio and wanting more. I have to say I wasn't disappointed. This is very good new wave with catchy tunes, good instrumentation and well crafted lyrics. The only reason I left off a star is because it is possibly the most depressing album I've ever heard. All the songs are about the futility and monotony of life.Like I say, it's a very good album, but I find myself not listening to it because it makes me want to kill myself (not really, but you get the idea)."
4,Nice Watch for the Money,"The watch is nice, looks better in real life than in the photo!I bought it as a gift and the recipient was very pleased with it."
5,Warlocked Rules,"Warlocked is probably the best strategy game that I have ever played. It is probably the best game for Game Boy, good for strategy game veterens, and is easy to learn for beginners. The graphics are excellent. You can even see your units struggle or fight. The music is very entertaining and there are even tons of digital voices. Warlocked has two different sides to play as (humans and Beasts). Each has tons of missions that will keep even the best gamers playing for weeks. There are also wizards that you can find on the battlefield that have powers that can assist you tremendously. In my opinion this a must-have game."
1,By someone who knows Jack Gorman,"Jack Gorman is slick. He is glib. He has lost his medical license. He admitted to having sex with at least one and possibly more patients. When it was exposed ""he tried to kill himself"". I don't think this man is qualified to write about mental heath. I give his book zero stars. I request him to stop posing like a doctor let alone an ""expert"" till he obtains mental health services for himself and has achieved some measure of rehabilitation.."
3,Awesome to prevent scratches,"This case does a great job of keeping scrathes off of the iPod, but further also keeps all of the dust off of the iPod, however this is a bad thing, as this thing attracts the dust like no other. WARNING: DO NOT [I REPEAT DO NO] bring this case with you to the beach. Once grain of sand got in mine, and completely demolished the screen. The only other thing that I'd have to complain about is that it doesn't seem to stick to the screen too well, which provides for even harder viewing of the screen. It also is VERY hard to get on."
3,its ok,this case is ok it does protect from scraches but attracts lots of dust and i have a problem with the screen protector there are these little stecks that at first i thought were dust but they are acually inside of the plastice of the screen protecter does anyone else have this problem?
3,Your little friend Rubber Dusty!,"It protects the Ipod, but gathers dust very efficiently, especially if you put it in your pocket. Using a piece of tape to take dust of the Ipod screen as well as the inner and outer surfaces of the screen protector helps in keeping the dust to a minimum. Air bubbles also get trapped between the screen and the screen protector. It looks OK if it's clean and bubble-free.The rubber casing prevents the Ipod from sliding around while on your car seat or in your lap, which is convenient.It IS hard to get on, but keep in mind that 1) it can help to turn it inside out while getting it on and b) a little chapstick or vaseline helps the process greatly."
3,Would not recommend,"I think that this case is terrible... It collects dust and it is very hard to get it out. Seeing the screen threw the case is a huge problem, the dust makes the colors terrible and if you want to watch a slideshow then take it off becuse it is hard to see. However I give it three stars becuase it does a good job at keeping scratches off of it."
1,Doesn't Work for 30 GB,"First of all, this cover is advertised as being for 20 or 30 GB ipods. However, a 30 GB, as I discoverd, is much slimmer and therefore does not fit snugly into the case. It probably won't fall out, but the screen doesn't stick to it completely. Also, because of the material used to make the case, it does attract a lot of lint and fibers and dirt. I defanitely would not recommened buying this iPod cover."
4,Stellar Banjo Playing,"This is the 1992 re-issue of banjo player Pete Wernick's first solo album from 1978. It also features Tim O'Brien on half of these tracks. The following year these two would form the nucleus of the progressive bluegrass band Hot Rize. Fans of that band will find much here to enjoy.While much of this is essentially straight-ahead bluegrass, Wernick throws in a few new wrinkles--phase-shifted banjo here, a flute there, even a synthesizer on one track (""Wichita Lineman""). As Tony Trischka says in the liner notes: ""The thing that knocks me out is Pete's ability to work within a bluegrass context and still come up with new sounds.""Though he may not be as well known as fellow banjo pickers Bela Fleck, Bill Keith or Tony Trischka, Wernick is one of the instrument's major innovators. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
4,Her best romantic ballads.,"Regina Belle is a unique and truly talented songstress who easily bridges the gap between Jazz Vocals and Soul. This collection serves as anice retrospective of her best Columbia tracks. Like Anita Baker and Sade, Regina has chosen to continue making real music--and she deserves our respect and admiration for doing so."
2,arnold turner,"Very disappointing. This is a brief treatment of a vital subject. The content is accurate but unsupported by significant scriptural references that help the reader know where the truths are taught in the Bible. If you really want to learn what the Bible teaches of the Holy Spirit, this book will not help you get there."
2,Exceptionally poor design.,"This is indeed a map of JAX (Jacksonville, FL). However, it is not very usable. The design of the map is at flaw. Rather than capturing the majority of JAX on one side, the printers made it so that half of JAX is on one side, half on the other. If they had printed it horizontally, rather than vertically, one would be able to view all of JAX on one side of the map. The map is an absolute no for wall or flat hanging. A yes perhaps if you enjoy driving, unfolding, turning back and forth, etc. while driving. What a shame!"
1,a bright and shining failure,"Worked great and seemed great until warranty expired. Within months after that, total failure. The base no longer communicated with the handsets, rendering the entire unit unusable, which could only say ""Searching..."". I have owned several brands and types of phones, and many have serious shortcomings (Panasonic, for instance uses proprietary *BAD* batteries in their units - a constant headache and expensive expense); I am going with Uniden this time, which I have found to be of good quality so far."
2,Mystery Ranch,Stopped reading about half way through. Can't get enough of the character's personalities to care about them. Story to slow for me.
4,OK,Drags a little in spots but good for an afternoon or evenings read. Not one you would want to reread.
3,A good mystery,"Not a A+. but certainly readable. A little too predictable, but certainly a better read than a lot of others. Good desctiptions of the area. A good read on a cold, rainy day. ."
3,Okay read,Hard to get into interesting story line though. needed more excitement more twists to the plot good setting though would read more by this author
4,mystery ranch,"the book was entertaining ,a good mystery and well written . a very good plot,good charactores,colorful good discription of the country side ,i just enjoyed it alot. dwick"
3,Odd but really good,"Even though this is oddly written, I actually got into the mystery. It has a great twist that I never saw coming. For a free book it was pretty good. I would recommend it."
1,Mystery is right!,I couldn't get into this book from the start. Maybe I'll try again some day but for now it is sitting in my archives.
2,Ho Hum,Just good enough to keep you from putting it back in the back shelf to maybe read when you are in the nursing home. Very shallow plot and weak characters. Reader will need a few gin and tonics to get through it rascal.
5,excellent,David suchet does such a wonderful job with Poirot! I watched his portrayal in the BBC series before buying this and I was not disappointed. He can change his voice so much he makes such an interesting narrator. Definantly would recommend
3,Poirot,This series of audio books was fun for me as I am a Poirot fan and an Agatha Christie fan. I would recommend this item to those who enjoy the author.
3,just a gift,I bought this item as a gift for my son for Christmas. Great idea for someone who travels several hour long trips per week!
1,Poirot Investigates: Eleven Complete Mysteries,"Not bad, not great. Would not go out of my way to recommend it to friends."
4,Dorothy,If you like Agathe Christie's book you will love these cd's. Great for a long car ride. He does a great job of telling the stories in all the voices.
5,Excellent collection of Chinese folktales,"I was pleasantly surprised with this collection of short-story mysteries. I had seen the television versions, but the stories are still a delight! Suchet performs brilliantly, able to play both the English characters as well as the delightfully Belgian Poirot. The best thing about these short mysteries is that if you wish to pit your wits against the Great Detective, they are solvable. Also, unlike some of the other CD collections, the mysteries end on the CD they start on, so you have 2-3 complete mysteries per CD. This is really great if you are using them in your car."
4,"Redundant, but a good price","There is a lot of overlap between the different dvds. Each dvd seems to have something that the others don't, but they also have a lot of the same routines. But given its price, it wasn't a bad deal."
3,100th Anniversary Edition Victor Borge: Classic Collection,"There was a lot of repeat footage. The first dvd; ""The Best of Victor Borge - Acts One and Two"" had had about 90% of everything that is on the other five dvds. It was great to see Victor Borge, but for such a long career the was very little sampleing of what he did."
2,Shame on the producers of this set,"Victor Borge deserves 5 stars. The producers, however, are charlatans who took one disc worth of material and duplicated it into 6 discs. If you can get a used copy for cheap, then it is worth it as Borge is really very funny and charming. $10 would be a fair price for this product."
5,Excellent Purchase,"For anyone interested in Victor Borge, this collection is what you're looking for! The man is hilarious and these six DVDs show him at his best."
3,Target has it for $20.00,"As a big fan of Victor Borge, I was quite happy to find this set at Target for $20.That said, after viewing the six discs, there is a lot of repeating of material. Others have mentioned that it could have been trimmed down to a smaller set and I agree with them. If I had paid $30-$50 I would have been upset.At $20, I can live with that.My advice is either wait until it drops in price or pick it up at Target."
3,Victor Borge classic collection,I found that once you saw the first DVD the rest were just about the same with only a few differences. He did so much it is a shame that the DVD's had to be repeats.
3,Too much repetition,Borge is great but the content of each DVD is largely the same. The boxed set could be easily reduced to two discs
2,Hard to get too much of Borge,"I enjoyed the first two DVDs I listened to, but the set is too big because they are very repetitive. Borge was active so long that I thought the collection would be broader than it is. I loved him when I was young and still do, but the collection could have been half this large and accomplished the same thing."
4,An Excellent Collection,"I can't say enough about the skill of Victor Borge at both performing piano and entertaining via comedy. He's a true genius.The collection itself, however, leaves a little to be desired. My only complaint (and thus, the reason I only gave it 4/5 stars) is that the DVD's seem a bit redundant; most of them contain the Marilyn Mulvey scene (the exact same version of that scene), and many also contain the Phonetic Punctuation (albeit, one of his funniest acts). However, I would prefer a little more diversity; normally when purchasing a collection like this, one would expect to see something entirely different on each DVD. Otherwise, highly recommended, as I know of no better collection at the moment."
2,6 copies of one good CD,"The bad news: This 6 CD set was a big disappointment. The first was great, but the next 3 were repeats of the same material. Didn't bother watching the last 2.The good news: We are giving the individual CDs as gifts and won't miss a thing."
2,Not worth the price,"If you want to see a variety of this comedic master, this not the set for you. The same routines were on almost all the disks. I was very disappointed. What a waste of money!"
3,good for the price,Sign is cute but very flimsy thin plastic. Suitable for inside the garage. Would defiantly recommend a different more durable sign if you plan on displaying this outside.
5,Requesting A Sequel !!!!!!!!!!!,"Mmmmmmmmm!!!This book was done very tastefully...Oh Please!! let there be a sequel to this book.I really enjoyed ""Devin's character and most of all the description of him was definitley a man I would be interseted in.....lolI enjoy books that can put me in the story with them...and this was one of those stories...Loved It!!! Loved It... Loved It!!!!Sequel Please!!!!!!!!!"
2,I tried to believe....but I couldn't,"I liked the general idea for the book. I liked the direction the author was trying to take it. But I just couldn't believe any of the characters. The way they met, the way they related to each other, the conversations they had it was just too over the top fantasy. The way Devin's former lovers reacted to his ""problem"" and to meeting each other. I just couldn't get into the characters at all. It wasn't real. Maybe I could believe that one of the people in this book would actually act like they did in this book in real life but not a whole book of unrealistic characters. That i can't buy."
3,Far Cry From Reality,"Devin Alexander being every woman's man was a far cry from reality. Although, I have to appreciate this character for always revealing his inabilities before getting involved with naive women who failed to realize that they could not change him. Him sparing no expense to wine, dine and deliver lavish gifts was a bit pointless if there was no future. Once revealing his emotional baggage to Sophia ""2"" things became very far fetched. What I did like about the book was it's explicit sexy scenes which was the glue that held my attention. Without them, it was just a bunch of gibberish. Once the book came full circle it became very predictable and unrealistic."
2,its not good,its not a worthy shoe for the price.the material used look to be a cheap quality shoe.any way the shoe is comfortable for running
5,Classic,"One of the best albums, ever. Ths song selection is fabulous and the quality of the live performance really makes you, the listener, feel like part of that great live show."
4,the import is better,i give this cd only 4 stars because the 2-cd import is much better and includes the WHOLE concert (with songs like 'Mujer de oleo') which shouldn't be missed..
1,Cambiaron el cd que contenia dos cd's por uno,"Este album es muy bueno, era mejor cuando ofrecian los dos cd's. Ahora cobran 36 dolares por el mismo que vale 13 dolares, por lo tanto no vale la pena comprar este, pero si el de 13 dolares"
2,Terrible rendition of Ojala,"This has to be by far the worst rendition of Ojala that I have ever heard. Upon listening to the song for about a minute, I promply discarded it to where it rightly belongs ... the trash."
4,still as good as when it first came out...,"purchased the series individually. The packaging is not the greatest, but what counts is what is inside....great series; too bad it ran out of steam."
5,"One of the best, non-conspiracy episode made. Loved it!","One of the best, non-conspiracy episode made. Loved it! The delving into Mulder and Scully's psyche by the ghosts was classic!"
3,Season Six,"The X-Files goes Hollywood, and in my opinion, that's not a good thing.the show starts it's decline right here"
4,Progressively sillier,"After season 3 The X-Files seemed to go down hill in story quality, but especially after season 5 the silliness of the characters and the stories has increased dramatically. Despite this criticism, this is still a great series and a good season 6. Duchovney and Anderson continue to deliver superb acting, and there are many must-see episodes."
5,America's Great Past Time Meets Sci-Fi,"This review is for Episode 19 of Season 6, ""The Unnatural"".One of my favorite episodes, Written and Directed by David Duchovny himself.Touches on subjects like racism, friendships, sacrifice (albeit briefly). Gives us insight into the culture/traditions of an alien race living amongst us & the lenghts one would go through to break away from them. With a backdrop of 1940's America.Excellent music in the background, primarily that of ""Come and Go With Me to That Land"" by Bernice Johnson Reagon.In a nutshell, it's a touching story of how baseball brought together two unlikely friends & the freedom many of us feel on the playing field."
1,Bad disks!,Looking forward to this season but 2 of the disks were damaged and would not play. I returned them and order them from Walmart and the same thing happened. Must be a defective lot. Will order again in a few months and maybe they will be okay.
4,Best Season,"From the highly imaginative ""Dreamland"" complete with the Marx Bros Mirror scene to alien baseball, Halloween Christmas style to the beginning of the UFO madness, this has got to be the best X-Files season while the Scully and Mulder team were together full force. There are no bad or even mediocre episodes in this collection. Well worth the price."
3,"Gets Too Weird, But Still Good","Aqua Mala is a great episode, full of nature's claustrophobic fury with a truly scary monster.Got to go watch it again now! <chill>"
3,Dissapointing,The first five season were much better. While there are some good episodes they are few and far between. But if you are a true X-files fan like I am then you will buy all the sets regardless.
2,great dvds - broken cases,All of the cases were broken and the dvds were loose and knocking into each other
4,Aliens everywhere,This episode was the one that starts to get Mulder his proof. There is one scene that doesn't make sense. Why in movies and TV shows when some kind of fluid is on the floor does the actor put his hand in it and roll it around on his fingers? Mulder knew that their was a virus and it was deadly but what does he do? He sticks his fingers in some kind of thick clear fluid. I wish these directors would stop showing this in movies. A normal person wouldn't do this. Other than that this episode was great.
5,The last perfect season.,"This season was excellent. But it also marked the end of The X-Files ""perfect season"" streak. Seasons 7 and 9 were really good, but not perfect like the previous six.In this season, we start pretty much where the movie left off. And we also have a conclusion to the syndicate, and dive deeper into the conspiracy of Mulder's sister. We also find out more about the alien rebels. Lastly, we end the season with a great cliffhanger that takes the season in a new direction, dealing with an interesting (although highly implausible) take on the genesis of life on this planet.Great season, great DVD."
2,Not good,This course was virtually useless. Not organized and not easy to understand what he's doing. Look somewhere else for instruction.
4,Decent,"Works well for a basic sliding glass door brace. A 2x4 cut to size would fit better obviously, but is also tacky. This sits low in the door, and is hardly noticeable. Serves the purpose I purchased it for...so I am pleased."
1,Security Shattered,"I bought this bar thinking that it would give my family an added sense of security. It seemed secure and made us feel safer until I came home early from work one day, forgetting that my teen daughter was home. She had placed the bar under the door and when I opened the door, the bar simply fell to the floor. My sense of security was completely shattered. Plan to purchase the buddybar for my family."
2,NOT AS STRONG,"It's okay. Not very strong. If you push hard enough you will go right thru the door. Still do not feel secure as I should with this on the door. Really, I think you should spend a little more and get a stronger jammer."
2,better than nothing (I suppose ;-),"The item seems to be rather poorly designed. The upper end cap isn't nearly wide enough to properly accept my door knobs. This allows a couple inches of play (before door meets any serious resistance). Another thing I don't like is the angle of the brace. I would much prefer a wider angle between the door and the base/foot of the brace. I realize that the bar is adjustable in length. However, if the bar is lengthened (the angle increased), the foot will not sit flat on the floor (it'll be cocked up with only the heel touching).It's clearly better than nothing. And, I've modified it (cut and filed), so that it works better than it did. But, I still don't have much confidence in it.I'd gladly return it for a refund, except that I've modified it."
3,"It works, but not as well as expected","I bought two of these for a friend who lives at home alone. I'm pretty happy with the design, excepting I would like to see a cleated foot so that the product has more traction on carpet. I think the rubber foot is minimally effective on carpet and my slip on hardwood floors.To restate, it needs a cleated foot for better traction on carpet.All I could give this security product was a three...maybe a three and a half, but not a four.I view this product as a deterrent to criminal entry, not an obstruction. Don't bet your life on it."
4,Good for the price,"There are nicer versions of these and you can definitely tell the difference in quality. However, this model will do the job just fine and at a fraction of the price."
2,A mistake,the device adjustable feature not working as good as advertise because the clickstop length adjustment not matched my slidedoor width. I need a continuous adjustable type like screw type.
3,"Fit well, no choice of colors, ladies style","I bought these stricktly based on the low cost. They work well, fit well, but they are more feminine design (obviously I'm a male then!). I use them but I left the rose colored ones at home so I don't have to be embarrased by them in public. It would have been nice to have color choices as the dark colored versions look much better on a male."
3,You get what you pay for,"This television looks okay cosmetically but even with a cable hookup the picture is blurred and definitely not clear. It's okay though. It only cost $110.00, no shipping charge, no tax, so you really can't complain."
5,"Excellent, Scientific, Historic, Precise. READ IT!","This is a very well written text which is careful, prudent, academic, scientific and yet reverent.Although not a novel nor fiction, it is hard to put down and hard to read only once.It is a MUST READ for anyone of any faith."
3,Will you need it at all?,"This is the PalmPix digital camera adapter from Kodak. Basically, it let you use the PalmPix camera which is Palm III based. However, adding PalmPix *AND* this Dock V will enlarge the size of our Palm a lot. If you rate portability more than features, it is not a good pick. Just in case that you dunno: PalmPix is CMOS based JPEG/BMP camera taking up to 640x480 images."
2,Too Simplistic,"The ""Advanced Placement"" part of the title is deceiving -- the software is too simplistic to be of real practical use, except perhaps for someone who is in the early part of an Introductory Stat course or who wants a preview of what Stats might be like for the first time."
5,Angelo Brothers 66961 One-Light Wall Lantern,For the price I paid ($10.20) this light is an excellent value. It is well made and easily installed.
2,Poor and Inconsistent DVD Player,"This was my second DVD Player with the first being a Toshiba SD-2109, which I loved but did not have the ability to play CDR's and CDRW's. After reading the technical readouts on various websites, I purchased this JVC Player for this particular ability. Additionally, the gold finish went well with my Sony WEGA. At first, the DVD player worked fine. However, after three months, this JVC started skipping on DVDs (New and Rented)and as a matter of fact, once, it completely jammed. It made a terrible sound (sort of like my DVD was being completely destroyed) and I was forced to unplug it and replug it back in. There was indeed some damage to my DVD. Now (about 8 months after purchase...I've been lazy about bringing it into a service center), it cannot go completely through one DVD without skipping. I am very disappointed with this product and am considering purchasing a new Sony or Panasonic DVD player."
1,Worked great for first year- now wont read disks at all,Just like a number of people have said... a bunch of them break shortly after being purchased. Mine worked fine for about 9 months then started getting really flakey. By then the warranty only covered parts and not labor so I have decided now to just shell out [the money]to get a sony rather than pay to get this fixed. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PLAYER!
1,ALERT--Very Poor Quality and Support,I bought the JVC DVD player and it worked for 3 months. After that the image started freezing. When I took it to the JVC service center they wanted to charge me $50.00 just to look at it even though it was still under warranty. I called JVC support and someone there told me that the model I had wasn't a JVC DVD player. I still have the box and the player clearly says JVC. I must say that the person with whom I talked to could hardly understand English. Result? I just trashed this DVD player and bought a DVD player from another brand.
5,Good DVD Player for the buck,... Easy to hook up.Sounds and video are very good toexcellant.Takes a little time to learn the remote control functionsbut once you do its all a breeze.Would recommend this player to peoplewho are looking for a good quality player with multi functions as thisis but for a lower price.
1,Double trouble,"We purchased two of these DVD players at the same time. One stopped playing DVD's right away. We chalked it up to dust from construction of our home. The second was never subjected to any of that as it was packed safely away. Now, it has just quit playing the DVD's. The lights come on, but the unit does not function. Do not buy this product."
1,Unreliable!,"We bought this model about 2 years ago. It worked fine for the 1st year....maybe a little less. Ever since, we've had trouble w/ the DVD player reading our discs. It will pause & skip about half way through our movies. When we play our DVD on our computer, it will play just fine all the way through....no skipping or pausing at all. We're very disappointed w/ this brand of DVD player!"
2,poor thing,"My review is that when you by something ,and you always stick with a brand you trust j.v.c and your d.v.d player goes south within 3 months and 1day that really sucks but i thought it was just bad luck untill i seen your reviews on this product thank you john"
3,Liverpool folly,"this a very good physcological novel. benson, the main character is sad but also quite funny, and his adventures carry you though efforlessly. crisp prose."
2,Couldn't do it,"I just stopped, bored. Maybe there is something here to grab someone, but not this total fan of Unsworth's other work. I say, read the book he was trying to write when I wrote this one. Sacred Hunger towers over this like Churchill over John Major"
1,where are all of the pictures corresponding to the analytical descriptions? Lame!,"Nuff said! If Im going to order a catalogue of sculpture in a museum,I want more than 5 pictures in the book!"
4,a pleasant surpise ....,"WELL , i wuz hoping to SKWIRREL HUNT with my Glenfield 60 . didnt want to spend big bucks . this came COMPLETE , direct clamp on , bore sight , headed to range and WOW !! watta surprize . a nice klear view , change very little with mag changes , focus very well and the BIG surprize ; adjustments were very incremental . a gentle tap after each adjust and watch it smoothly walk right into target . i'm not the ""super shooter"" , but well pleased with results . for the cost , i am amazed . yer turn !! ENJOIE !!"
3,corrections,"I am glad to see so many people interested in the Black Gold story. Unfortunately, there are a few details in the book that should have been corrected. The only man that knew the exact story passed away in August. To the person that suggested a movie be made, I agree, but would like to see the filmmaker talk to our family before starting. I can straighten one thing out. Pop Holcomb, Millard Holcomb, was a very strong, revered man but not a large burly type of man as the book suggests. It is a wonderful story but I wish Uncle Son could have told it to you."
5,Technically Excellent,"""Technically, it's excellent. This video offers great angles and exciting action shots. It gives you an entertaining look at the world of cross-country skiing. While skiing converts will love it, it's sure to draw others to the sport."" - Lynne Bermel, Ranked 3rd overall Ironman Triathlon World Cup"

3,Ricky's Hot but the DVD's not!,"I purchased this DVD to replace a VHS tape. I forgot that most of the videos are in Spanish and are not that good. The best videos are Livin' LaVida Loca and She's All I Ever Had. Plus, I really also wanted the videos ""Shake your Bon-Bon"" and ""She Bangs"". The Cup of Life from the Grammy's was not as good as I remembered, just ok. I give it a C+. Sorry Ricky, you're still HOT but your DVD's not!!"
5,no videos newer than 1999,"This is a very good collection, but it only includes videos from 2 cds, Vuelve(1998) and Ricky Martin(1999). It also includes his 1998 grammy performance of ""The Cup of Life"", and an interview. Most of the songs are in Spanish. Only two are in English (Livin' La Vida Loca, and She's All I Ever Had),and two are in Spanglish (Maria, and The Cup of Life). Since 1999, Ricky has put out two more English Cds and a few more Spanglish songs. I like listening to his Spanish songs,but as one of his English speaking fans, I would like to see a new video collection for us."
5,Execellent! Well done...,"What can I say...I own all of his albums! BUT, it is awesome to SEE the music performed. The content aside, sound & video are top quality. Artistically breathtaking. If you love Ricky Martin, this is the DVD/video to buy. I love the little ""extras"" that are on the DVD...up close & personal interview with Ricky! A ""thumbs-up"" on this one."
1,complete pile of junk,"I know amazon pushes these, but the cable I had was junk. SECRET: Buy monster on ebay -bought 2 6 footers for $25. All HDMI's will give you same pics, but some have higher fail rates. These failed me."
1,These people are scammers BEWARE,"Do Not buy from, i warn you!!!!! I did and they lied about the shipping and sent me the wrong item, BEWARE"
2,Be Careful What You Pay!,"The Price on this Cable has dropped about $10.00 from what I paid for it. I think the lowest price here I've seen today 02-07-09 has been about $19.95. I paid here about $28.46 when I bought this cable. Many things on Amazon are constantly being sold for lower ptices.Also...the Salespeople at Amazon told me I'd need 2 Cables for Instalation of a Home Theater System which I also paid much more for than the current price. I only needed 1 Cable package (which the Amazon salesperson even guided me through purchase of 2)...and I've had to go to all the trouble of sending 1 Cable package back for a Refund.It seems that if you ask for Help of a Purchase at Amazon, you're going to pay much more than is fair.Be careful what you Pay and on the Help you get from the Amazon HDTV and Home Theater System Store."
5,Excellant for the money,I plugged this in to my Cable unit to my TV and its been working every sense.Very good product for the cost.
2,I just didn't feel like it worked for me,I bought this book at the recommendation of my instructor. For a first year student it is hard to understand just what you need to pull out of the book it can be very confusing if you have to link that page and it recommends you going to another page for more information. The information in it would not a lot of time match up to what was going on with my patient. So disappointed in this book and had to buy another one for the right kind of information I was looking for so it was a real thumbs down for me! I wish I had really researched it out before I wasted my money on it. Just a book to sit on the shelf and collect dust now.
4,Not bad,At first this book is hard to figure out but once I got the hang of it I just rolled along. I even was able to help other classmates with this book and they have now gotten one of their own.
1,Terribly confusing! Poorly organized!,This is the book our Nursing program issues to all of us for care plans. I wish I had picked up the Sparks book earlier. The carpenito book is in my opinion a useless book! I will no longer be opening it since I found this new book to get my care plans done.
5,Nursing Diagnosis,Carpenito's Nursing Diagnosis is a life and time saver. I've used this book and shared with others as we've worked towards our Bachelors Degree's and forward.
4,One of the best Nsg Dx books written,"This edition and its previous editions were well written. The books clarify each nursing diagnosis and gives an excellent list of ""related to"" topics. One of the most useful sections is the Errors in Dx Statements. This helps students from misinterpreting diagnosis by giving a different perspective and by leading the reading to the correct dx. Age group considerations are excellent as well as the follow-up principles. A must have book for every nursing student. I am still waiting for psychiatric dx to be included. Okay, maybe I was too hard on the handbook. We should have been required to buy the full book. Hurry up and publish the 8th Edition...I need it for school!!! -Curtis Chow"
2,This book is frustrating and time consuming!,"I am not sure why my school chose this book/ Author. I have yet to meet anyone who enjoys using this book. I give it 2 stars only because it has all the NANDA dx in it (if you can find them!)I find it very time consuming. If you enjoy flipping back and forth to several pages without much help in finding what you are looking for, then this is the book for you. Index aside, this book needs to be more user friendly. I simply do not like the way it is organized. Risk Factors are seperate from Nursing DX, but stuck in the middle of the book, good luck following from one section to another! There is no friendly flow in this book to use it efficiently. Sorry, but I can't recommend this book. There has got to be a better way to write this book!"
1,Don't waste your money.,"Although my nursing school required this book, it is the most confusing and least helpful of all the 9 books I have on care planning and nursing diagnoses. I haven't met anyone who likes this book or finds it user friendly. In all the other books the rationales are written right after the interventions,this book does not use that format making it time consuming and frustrating. The book is unorganized and hard to follow. If this is not a required book,save your money for your tuition."
2,Of Uncertain value?,"This is essentially a a very expensive pamphlet with a copy ofthe @Risk software on trial. As one who bought the ""book"" because of its subject matter and its author I feel roundly cheated. The pamphlet itself has some introduction to the subject but essentially this is nothing more than an attempt to distribute some trial software at cost.I suspect the audience for this pamphlet already know of @risk and its competitors. Equally they will probabaly have this or a competitor software already.I do appreciate the quality of @Risk - but this seems a ""cheap"" way of earning some extra revenue without really extending the user base."
1,Buyer Be Ware!!!,Bought this package for my project management class. Found out it is only a two week trial software. If you are a student buying this for your class go to the Palisade website. You get a one year license for the same price. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
1,Stay away from Danze!,"We built our new home 5 years ago and installed Danze brand plumbing fixtures at the recommendation of our contractor's plumber. The soft touch personal shower (wand) on our Roman tub may have worked a month before failing. We have since replaced it three times, during which time the manufacturer changed the internal working design. (My first clue that there would be additional problems.) Of course, we have had to pay plumbers each time for their work to replace the faucet. And today it still doesn't work. Danze, pretty faucets, they just don't work. We have also had problems with the standard shower fixture in our guest bathroom numerous times. (also Danze) Their customer service department has always been kind. But their product is simply inferior."
4,a good book,"This is a great book and I enjoyed reading it. However, this is a book that is not in McKillips style. It is not fantasy. Instead, It is a mystery for young readers. None the less, it is worth the time of any true Patricia Mckillip fan."
5,Stories of Great Hymns,"Hymn book written to help children better understand the hymns they sing. Contains twenty Christian hymns with brief histories about how each one came to be written and gives a simplified musical arrangement. Includes ""O Little Town of Bethlehem"", ""All Creatures of Our God"" and ""Holy, Holy, Holy!""."
5,big twist and the mello fellows,"i met larry nolan and his band in culp illinois in 1957 he had just gotten started and as his rep. grew and band grew he just got better, and better i was going to siu in carbondale illinois and he played at a black owned night club called jr. hatchetts a late night place where everyone hung out .. he and his band are great and have really worked hard over the years to profect their craft.. larry nolen ( big twist ) is no longer with us but his band still goes on they are great espically that sax player from dowell ronnie halstead"
5,Big Twist and a Trip to Cleveland,"Big Twist played a club I worked at, in Roslyn NY, every year on Halloween from 78-81. Man I loved when he came, the last time he palyed Fri and Sat, then I saw him at another club were he shared the bill with James Brown, that was MON and Tues and after the show on tues he invited me to his next gig on Wed. I said no problem so we jumped in my car and followed them to Cleveland, caught the show Wed night and drove back to NY, he was that good. This is a great CD and a must have for anyone who loves great Chicago Blues."
2,Disappointing Bistros,This book does not go beyond a superficial description of the interiors of the bistros. The writers completely ignore the food and there is not one description of a dish one may expect at any of these establishments.It is of no value to anyone requiring guidance to select an authentic Parisian bistro.
5,Excellent little guide,"I bought this excellent little guide in France last year under the name of AU VRAI ZINC PARISIEN. Small, handy to carry around, full of useful information and terrific photos. Only comment, the French version has a nicer cover..."
4,sooooo cute!!!!,It was my favorite book when I was a kid and now my girls love to read it too. Its a must for any little girl who thinks her dolls are people too!
5,A Pleasure for little girls everywhere!,I have been looking for this book for my daughter because it was clearly my very favorite book when I was a child. The description of the other dolls in the book and all of their individual attributes sent my imagination reeling. I also remember learning how to find beauty in all things from reading this book. A must read for girls everywhere!
5,A story that stays with you....,I have loved this book my whole life. I think it is a great reminder for today's materialistic youth.
5,Such a sweet book,"This is a nice story, similar to the ""Velveteen Rabbit"" that shows how the most loved and valued toys aren't necessarily the prettiest, newest or fanciest. Here, Betsy has several dolls and must choose one to take to a doll party, where there will be prizes. She chooses to take her worn and old but very much loved doll to the party, rather than a newer or prettier doll that would very likely win a prize. The story of how Betsy chooses the doll to take to the party, and what happens at the party, is very sweetly told, without any of the gory elements present in some other books that deal with this theme (for example, Rumer Godden's ""The Dolls House"" or even ""Velveteen Rabbit"", both of which involve old toys getting burned). Because of the lack of disturbing elements, this book is great for very young readers. I loved it myself when I was a little girl of five or so."
5,Excellent Children's Book.,This is a book from my own childhood that I bought for my own little girl and I've bought it as a gift for others. Very charming story with a beautiful lesson.
5,"Beautifully Illustrated, Wonderful Detail","Just enough information for those in search of a better understanding of the human body. Sections of the book are broken down into the different organ systems, their many functions and processes. Several implications are described and detailed with full color graphics. I especially appreciate the book's symptoms table, which allows you to identify symptom characteristics, associated symptoms, other relevant factors, and advises on possible causes and actions. This book has a sturdy structure that will stand up to the test of time. It is constucted of high quality paper, cardstock, and has a short thick stature. A must have reference for those in the health industry or interested in anatomy."
2,Not Detailed enough,"This book is all over the place, i honestly didn't like it. it's also not detailed enough."
1,AC Power Adapter,I am sorry I purchased this product. Whenever I use it the adapter becomes so hot that I am afraid that it will hurt my iPod. I have discontinued using it. My advice to anyone who wants to purchase this DO NOT purchase it. You will be sorry you did.
1,Memories of a Kansas publicity hack,"The spine says Four Star Press, it should say One Star. This is a so called Hollywood Publicist that can't even spell Peter Bogdanovich's name right. His biggest claim to fame is that Rush Limbaugh was in his wedding party. If you're interested in legends such as Peggy Rea and Julie Warner, which stars come from the Kansas City area or publicity events like the Kansas City Tap Challenge, this book comes highly recommended. Otherwise, it's dull and awkwardly written, revealing less than the average issue of Entertainment Weekly. Not worth your time."
3,batman vs dracula,i enjoyed this movie . i thought it was cool that dracula thought that batman modeled his image after drac .
4,Its suprising good,I wasnt going to buy this dvd as I am not a big fan of the new batman series...as it is in the line of the batman begins movie and rewrites the history of batman as we knew it...But after watching the movie on the cartoon network it rates as good as the other movies based on the first batman series so i am going to have to buy this...
3,Batman vs Dracula,"Good story telling not the best of all the batman straight to DVD movies,but this was so much better then the show,I was actually able to enjoy this besides the horrible joker voice and look of joker I mean,everything else is good and I would def add this to my collection of DC animated DVDs if I was you"
5,a fun well drawn batman movie!,"reminiscence of the 80s/90s cartoons, which i watched as a kid so am therefore bias. the joker, the pen man and dracula are all good characters."
4,Not bad,"I don't care for THE BATMAN, to me, it pales in comparision to Batman animated. But I picked this up, mostly from recommendations, really cheap, like 8.99 for amazon. It was entertaining. Good story, good action. Animation wasn't to bad either. For a hardcore batman fan, its a must. For the casual observer, skip it. I don't recommend this for kids under 10."
4,Cool,"I never did see the new series. I loved the movie. The Graphics were new and excellent, but, I am very used to the old graphics.I did not like Bruce as a young man, too young compared to the old one!I loved the joker he looked cool and darker with a very strong laugh!The new Batman has a very dark environment than the old series.Even tough I am a big fan of Batman. However, Batman seemed too weak in front of Count, I don't want to spoil the movie and how batman won!... ops! Sorry.. Oh come on like you really don't know who will win already! LOLI really enjoyed the movie; every batman fan should see this conflict between the Dark Prince and the Darkness Count"
4,It looks good,"I saw about 10 minutes of this at the San Diego Comic Con this year and it looks good. If you like the TV show, then this is probably up your alley. I really like Matsuda's designs and the premise for Dracula being in Gotham was actually well done. Give it a chance, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
4,More than adequate,"A production that involves Dracula is always at risk of being campy. But this film works quite well: apart from an Alfred whose British-butlerhood is over the top, the performances are very competent, and the details of the plot are clever in small ways. It might be interesting to make a live-action feature out of this. A talented team could subtilize the script and invest the story with more meaning. Anyway, thanks for the fun."
4,Batman vs Dracula,I really can't review this item as it is a gift for our grandsons at Christmas.I'm sure they'll love it.
3,kids will enjoy this film,I kinda enjoyed the movie. Not as bad as I thought it could be. I wish the penguin wuz not in the film(i have never liked the character). The movie moves along at a brisk pace so not to bore. It could be a little violent and creepy for young children though. I got the dvd for $10 I would not have bought it for $20. My son who is 9 really loved it. So I guess the youger fans will enjoy. People who want more depth or reality might not care for it. But if their looking for reality they should not be watching these type of films anyway.
5,Pretty Darn Good,"I was really excited when the series came out originally. I loved the original BTAS, and was pleasantly surprised with ""The Batman."" My wife and I have Saturday morning ""The Dude"" dates to watch the episodes together!It was an extremely dark animation, and that is how it should be. To see what happens to the Joker is worth buying it alone.GREAT MOVIE! It would make an incredible live action film. Think of it, it would be the perfect combination of ""Blade"" and ""Batman Begins!"""
1,Terrible.,"This movie is a poor execution of a lazy concept. The entire plot is one cliche after another, predictable to the point of being unintentionally funny. The movie even throws in a few cliche plot points that aren't even relevant to the plot, as if the writer just like them enough to want to include them. The dialog is filled with just the sort of ham you'd imagine, but it's so uninspired that it's devoid of any fun. There's nothing interesting or creative about how Dracula is portrayed, or anybody else in the film for that matter.This movie also features the worst portrayal of Batman I've ever seen. He comes off as being really dumb, and socially clumsy when not in costume. Overall, he actually comes off as being a bit girly at times. Some character development or backstory for him is hinted at occasionally, but never actually made part of the story.Overall, there's really nothing about it to recommend."
1,CRAP!,"What were they thinking? This is the worst Batman version that I ever saw. Please, folks, leave this alone and get anything else. The Joker is unrecognizeable here, first, he doesn't walk without shoes, he have class, the class of a gangster. Second, he doesn't have this ridiculous anime hair. Don't waste your time seeing this."
4,The Bat and The Legend,"First saw it over a year ago in Arizona; LOVED IT and was delighted to get ahold of it when I tripped across it on amazon. Excellent flick, and while its not quite one one might expect if one follows the dark night animated series (such as the new justice league from 2006 and such OR the original batman from 1999 < before it became 'batman and robin' for a while), but its more of stepping into a movie tie in with the ""The Batman"" new series. The joker isn't what he was, nor is the penguine ( again, these are re-envishionings of the original characters and such) but I honestly think that when the joker is turned, he becomes even MORE enjoyable.. and personally, I am impressed that he's insanely clever that when he goes hunting for blood, the first place he hits is a BLOODBANK.. no more corpses or such.. but hundreds of gallons of blood at his whim. definetly doesn't leave an easy trail for authorities.The night watch nurse... ahh.. she was just the orderves.."
5,A must have to understand Catholic doctrine,This is a nicely edited Bible.The introduction alone justifies buying this edition as it explain the fundamental reading key of the Bible according to the Catholic tradition and many other fundamentals.
5,Leapster lmax handheld game system Teal blue with grey in color,This seller was awesome she is number # 1 in my book. L-max leapster learning system was the best I ever bought for my grandson ever bought for him used and he has not put it down for nothing!! He holds the lmax - system everywhere we go luvs his .And everybody that is looking at these make sure u buy collectibles which means used but make sure and read to make sure the l-max game is in good condition!! I would highly recommend this to any parent the games r educational. The game system is made excellent!!! People save your money buy used!!! Well worth it. Kristen.
1,never again,"After purchasing what I thought was a new Leapster Game System for my grandaughter, I found out it was really used. Also, the system does not work. Now, all I get is the runaround from Amazon. I will no longer do business with Amazon."
2,Hmmm....,"I have really mixed feelings about this one. On one hand, the story that is the backbone of this film is interesting - the effects of childhood abuse and isolation. On the other hand, the screenplay is horribly written. The characters are completely unlikable, and the only one you feel sorry for is the dog (which might not even be real!). And don't even get me started on production value. In which backwoods town does this take place? The cops look like incompetent morons, everyone drives twenty year old cars, the busses look like they have been running since the seventies. The acting is horrible too - did nobody learn how to emote? Overall, the only good thing about this whole film is the idea."
4,Very good,"I read the package and decided to give it a try. I have to say this was a pretty interesting film that kept my attention throughout. I did however guess what was coming about a half hour or so before the twist began to materialize. This takes nothing away from the film as the other people watching with me all declared I had to be wrong. Marc Blucas did a credible job in the role of Kevin, the one being stalked by the sadistic killer and Laura Jordan was very good as his grown up childhood sweetheart, Samantha, but Justine Waddell as Jenifer, the police psychologist was just excellent. Anyway, the bottom line here is, give this film a chance. It is a pretty good low budget thriller that does not leave you feeling that you've wasted a hundred and some minutes of your life. I understand this was based on a novel. I might have to give the novel a try, or at least look up other things that the author may have written. I see possibilities there too."
3,"If you liked/disliked the movie, READ THE BOOK",I highly recommend reading the book regardless if you liked or disliked the movie. The book is so much more intense and gives more background information than the movie.
5,Original Sin.,"_Thr3e_ is an excellent movie about a seminary student obsessed with sin. It is while working on his thesis on the nature of sin that he becomes ensnared in the web of a serial killer - the Riddle Killer. A cop/psychologist must help the young student sort out his difficulties. At the end, all is revealed and the nature of obsession becomes clear. The movie seems to be making some sort of commentary on a largely out of touch older generation and a helpless younger generation. Ultimately though it causes us to question the nature of sanity and reality itself."
4,Better than many films these days..homage to the past,"This film indirectly pays homage (and borrows heavily) from a classic psychopathic killer film from the past .... (I WON'T SAY MORE THAN THAT).........and for a lower budget film is MUCH BETTER and MORE ENTERTAINING than 80% of the bigger budget films seen these days.I have to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because the way certain scenes were shot tend to intentionally mislead the viewer as to the true storyline... even so about 60 minutes into the film everything came together and the ending was pretty well figured out.Despite these minor criticisms, it again was very well done."
4,Entertaining,"Well, I was in the mood for something different and not mainstream, and since I've never heard of this movie it did a great job of whetting my appetite. It wasn't something completely different, the plot and the reveal have been done a thousand times in other movies, but it mixed it up enough to keep things fresh and enjoyable.This is the story of Kevin, a seminary student working on his final thesis. His life changes when a riddling psycho calls demanding that he confess his sins. From there, Kevin must find out who it is before the psycho kills everybody in Kevin's life. With the help of his childhood friend and a cop, he begins thinking that the killer may not be who he originally thinks it is.In the end, I found it entertaining and well worth the time to watch, though I can't imagine myself doing it again sometime soon."
4,Very Nice,"This is a very good selection of contemporary Scottish music, with an interesting variety of songs and a balance between the vocal and instrumental. There is a range of everything from semi-traditional ballads to Scottish techno. Many of the songs capture authentic Celtic flair. But those who are looking for traditional Scottish music will probably not be pleased with this CD, as even the traditional songs are arranged in somewhat contemporary style. This is modern music with a traditional flair."
3,not using it much,Nice book but really too busy to spend much time with it. Might pass it along to a younger person interested in improving their Spanish as Spanish is spoken a lot here.
1,Illegible on the Kindle,"This product has been made for Kindle and I bought it. What a disappointment! Does ANYBODY look at these things before they are released? The exercises are so tiny as to be unreadable on Kindle, and the font size option does not work with them. Of course, the exercises are the most valuable part of the book. I would really like to have this book, but it is unusable in its current Kindle form.Question: Doesn't anybody at the publishing house test these things on Kindle before they release them on an unsuspecting world? The fact that a thing is available for Kindle would suggest to the normal mind that it is formatted for Kindle and works for Kindle, particularly something from a professional publisher. For Kindle users this is a trap. AVOID!If they clean this thing up, I will buy it, since it is a very good book otherwise."
5,"Excellent, affordable, comprehensive","This book is a must-have for anyone responsible for realistic decision making about his/her ability to provide health care at home, as well as an excellent how-to guide for those who accept the inherent responsibilities of the caregiver. I consider it the one ""best"" guide of those available to meet the needs of the growing number of home caregivers."
1,not the best book on the subject,is written by medicval types who seem more interested in impressing their peers than informing the lay person. it was monotonous and not very helpful. i prefer 'stages of senior care' by hogan
5,Really does work,"With all due respect to the other reviewer, this product really works well for me. I'd been having some major problems with sound popping in and out on my hearing aid and it was getting really frustrating. My audiologist told me it was being caused by moisture that was building up. She then told me about this product so I figure it was worth a shot.I'm SO glad I did!! It doesn't look like much. Just a little white cannister you drop your hearing aids in (take out batteries first!) and close it up tight. ALWAYS keep it closed tight, unless you are putting hearing aid in or taking it out). I have not had any problems with sounds popping in and out since I started using it. It's saved me a lot of money in servicing costs, that's for sure!I know these reiew are conflicting. I'd suggest giving it a try if you are having problems with your hearing aid or you think you might. What's the worse that could happen? You''re out a couple of bucks and no harm done. Just a thought."
5,"Fantastic price, reliable product","I've been using this product for several years and have never had a problem with moisture in my hearing aids. This is a fantastic price - best I've seen, half what you'd pay in the store including shipping."
2,Not for everyone,The item arrived in two days and packaging was fine.I do not recommend this item if your aid is RIC behind the ear.The physical size of the container requires that you must drop the aid in and shake it out.I replaced this item with Super Dri Aid which has a larger opening for every day use the Dri Eze fostore my backup aid.
3,I've used it 4 times and the lid has already broken off.,I've used it 4 times and the lid has already broken off. The plastic is not very high quality. Not recommended.
3,Does an OK job,Does the basic job of drying my hearing aids. The top sometimes pops open and it is really large- making it unusable for travel when I am trying to conserve luggage space
5,Works great!,"We looked at the systems for dehumidifying the hearing aids, but they we expensive and cumbersome. This is a small compact product we only have to purchase twice a year."
2,Disappointing product,I tried to avoid taking my electric dry box on a trip and purchased this product to take instead. I don't feel that it did anything at all to dry my hearing aids. It is basically someplace to store them.
2,Re-Sets,Gave this to my husband as a Christmas gife in 2005. Since the beginning it enexpectadly re-sets all settings back to default of noon on Jan 01. This happens every 2-3 days even with fresh batteries. Compass then needs to be calibrated as well as any alarms need to be re-keyed. Waiting to hear from vendor on replacement.
4,My experience,I purchased this item before taking a trip to North Pole. Some how I ended up at the South Pole.Just kidding it is a great compass and has all the features that one would need for all out-door activities.
3,Not for everyday student use,"This is a great looking bag and is great if you are using it as a""gig"" bag, just to take your instrument back and forth to performances, etc. In our situation it did not work well. It does not seem to be made for situations, like my high schoolers, where he is leaving it in the band room lock-up or storage. It is not made for the abuse that these bags receive when the instruments are pushed around on shelves, put on buses for school performances and such. When we took our son's trumpet in for service to the local music store, they told us it is not made for that and to just use the old hard case that we still had. So my fault but I wasted my money."
4,Gator Trumpet Gig Bag does the job.,"My trumpet had been unused for 50 years and was part of a music display in my home office. When I decided to dust it off and start playing again the case I had for it was no where to be found.I needed something a little classier and softer than a plastic Walmart bag to pack it in when I go to my high school reunion next month and the Gator bag does the job. The price is right, the fit is good, the padding is sufficient and there is an outside pocket for my mouthpiece and a few sheets of music folded in 2.It would never survive with checked bagage but as a carry-on or, in my case, to stick in the car for a driving trip, its perfect."
4,nice gig bag,"Would be nice to have a small pocket inside the side pocket for mouthpieces, but otherwise a nice bag. I bought one for my nephew a while back and he liked his so I decided to get one too. It will partially replace my old Bach case which will now be relegated to storing mutes and other items I need only occasionally."
3,A bit short,"The quality is decent, especially for the price but it is a very tight squeeze to get my son's trumpet to fit. There's no designated storage area for the mouthpiece either, and certainly nothing for music to go in. Otherwise it's pretty heavy duty."
4,good gig bag,I like it very much. Maybe price is kinda high. Well we are satisfied and that's what matters. Good Product.
5,Great item,I bought this for my grandson to transport his bugle to Boy Scout meetings and camp. It is just the right size and easy for him to carry along with his other gear.
3,silly fun,"Hillarious is the best way to describe this book. If you are the type of person who can laugh at themselves, dive in, otherwise stay home and hide under the covers."
3,Not exactly a rigorous text,"Although the material this book covers is important for any undergraduate mathematics student to learn, the approach Stahl takes is not as rigorous as a student planning to go onto grad school should get. If you are simply interested in a glimpse at group theory and Galois theory, then I recommend the book. If you want to really get your hands dirty, then I suggest possibly something by Herstein."
3,Better than Final Fantasy 3,"Pros:Good GraphicsExcellent Remake of the original NES versionNice cutscenesCon's:-""Leveling"" system is not like other FF games-""Where to go"" can become confusing at times.-""Random Battles"" can be frustrating-No save-points. Can only save on the map or at a specific point can prove frustrating.-Abit on the boring sideNice game to purchase at the used price."
3,Decent Game,"It is a decent game if you like the whole FF Series. No where near my favorite of the series, but it was mostly enjoyable. I would give this game about a 6/10."
1,This game sucks d*ck!!,Don't ever buy this game the graphics suck and the story line sucks d*ck.Also not to mention if you die you have to start over from the beggining like the start menu and you can't skip anything.Also you are level one and the enemies are all level 20 no matter what and you instantly die and fleeing gets you killed quicker.
4,Great sound but oxidized in 3 months,"I bought two monster cables, one of 12 ft. and another with 21 ft. the 21 ft. I bought first and don't oxidized like this, in 3 months it oxidized. But the sound continues great!"
1,"Overrated, Expensive and Unreliable","Monster products are overrated and overpriced.I have one and the end fell off on the very first gig.It was replaced by the lifetime warranty, but it was a hassle getting it exchanged.Also, the cables are heavy and bulky.Rapco cables are much better and about half the price."
5,Great Heavy Duty Cables,"These are great heavy duty cables. They are nice and thick so they don't tangle as easily as many others do. They are a bit overpriced, but the quality is really high and you get a lifetime warranty. These cables are very well made and extremely reliable. Also, they do help some with reducing amp hum."
2,Don't buy,"I would not recommend this product. It maybe cheap however, you will be happier spending some more money and getting a more compact scope. This is a good telescope for putting out on your deck. It's way too big and clumsy for range useage."
3,Table Top Tripod,"I don't know yet how good the scope is, but read the fine print on this. They refer to the tripod several times, but only one sentence at the end of the information tells you that the tripod is less than 1 foot tall.I was expecting the full size tripod that I've gotten with other scopes that I have ordered from Amazon. Very disappointing. Bordering on misleading.In my mind, if you say ""tripod"" it means a full size tripod. If its the special table top model of tripods, or there is anything else about it that limits its functionality, you say so everywhere you mention it."
4,Sportview spotting scope ( 20-60x60mm ) from Bushnell,"For the price---this is a pretty decent spotting scope. It has performed flawlessly, so far; and it has been very easy to use. I have yet to try it in a low light environment; so, I will have to wait to evaluate that aspect of this scope. Worth the money,IMHO!"
4,not for me,"The product was absolutely fine and delivery was very quick. Unfortunately this product is not made for ""real"" women. I do not consider myself or my friends heavy and we volunteered for a fishing tournament to benefit Hope Hospice in which we needed to wear camouflage tank tops. These tops at best would fit young teen girls. Sadly, we were unable to wear these."
2,GOOD OPTICS-BAD SYSTEM,ITS VERY DIFFICULT TO HOLD A SMALL SCOPE STEADY ENOUGH TO GET A USEFUL READING. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TYPE OF RANGE FINDER SYSTEM.
2,Just too shaky to be useful,"It works but its very shaky and subconciously I never reach for it. Also the shakiness tends to give you erroneous readings and you are probably better off visually estimating. But it works if you are very very, I mean very steady; which ain't gonna happen in the middle of the game."
5,Very Great Service,Bought this item for a gift for my son. He loves to golf and I am excited to give it to him. Very fast delivery and was in time for his Birthday.
4,Great Range Finder,This is a great range finder for the price. Very accurate and really it is all you need to spend to get a quality piece of equipment.
2,Only for math wizards.,"When purchasing this rangefinder there was no mention of how it works. First, you can only play on courses that use one foot marked flags. This is because you have to sight in on the green and then count the number of marks up on the flag. Then multiple that by three and then divide by eight to come up with the range.On the plus side it is still a pretty good scope for checking out the flora and fauna."
2,Not good for bow hunting...,"I bought this cause someone said it was good for hunting, its shortest distance is 50 yards, which is not a good bow shot. you need to have it on a flat ground to work, I dont golf so im not sure if it would work that good for that..."
3,So SO..,"this is really hard to figure out distance, and not accurate neither compared with gps.i may buy gps again or believe myself to figure distance."
1,Very bad,"It is very bad product. There are no user's manual and it could not help me to measure the distance. I had to throw it through the window. I was stupid when I chose this one. This system had problem, it requires me to rate when I split this product away, amazon is stupid."
3,Only good with flagsticks!,"The design of this product is based around measuring the distance to a flagstick, so you won't be able to use this product to measure distances to any random object. It also will not measure distances less than 50 yards.My unit did not come with any instructions, so here they are:Instructions: Within the golf scope is an etched rangefinder reticle. Once you have the base of the flag lined up to the bottom line of the reticle, simply determine distance to the flag by reading the numbers on the reticle that align with the top of the flagstick."
1,Waste of money and effort,"I really wanted to like this golf gadget. However, it is almost impossible to hold the rangefinder still enough to accurately see the distance readings. When I did make extensive effort to hold it motionless, the readings still were not accurate when compared to the distances noted on the course."
2,Not so good for golf,"I am 50 and have trouble keeping it stable. The combination of large magnification, small weight and tiny dimensions make it hard to hold in a steady position that allows accurate readings."
5,Must have for buget golfer!,"This product was my first golf range finder and it is a great piece of equipment. For the cost it is a must have for the buget golfer. My order arrived EARLY and in great condition. I ordered from optics planet and I am now a customer to them for all my optics needs. This comes with the scope, a small bag to put it in, a cleaning cloth, instructions, 5 golf tees, a diviot tool and a ball marker. This products shows that bushnell can make a low coast but high quality golf range finder for any and all golfers! P.S. This makes a great gift!"
5,Great Organic Doll for those little ones,This is a wonder doll for a very young child. The colors are exceptional and appears to be interesting for a child just a couple of months old. They can focus and also touch. It is very well made and is safe.
3,English literature - Le morte Darthur,"Not as happy with this purchase as I expected to be. I'm looking for this book in a ""legitimate"" translation, but in current English, not the original English language version."
1,Frustrated,"I have been dying to get my hands on this book because I really enjoy Arthurian literature. I genuinely wish I could say that I had an opinion on this book itself, but I do not. I was supposed to have received this package several days ago and upon looking at my tracking information I found that my delivery date had been pushed back almost an entire WEEK. Ordinarily, I have had such an easy time placing amazon orders and getting them in a timely manner. After this time though, I might think twice about where I buy my books in the future. Really disappointing."
1,Another Racist Movie,"This is another of the unlimited supply of anti-Arab racism that is prevalent in American media, of all types. A bad movie on all counts. Racist conception and goal, bad and disturbing story, and a bad production. I do not recommend it to anyone, unless he or she enjoyes putting down other people, and has no brains to figure how he or she is being used in anti-Arab propaganda."
5,Whiteboyz ON DVD!!!!,"Loved this! Smoking movie! Funny Bright! As a matter of fact it was first film I loved Snoop Dogg in-that scene in jail was hilarious! Also the dream sequences in the cornfield and the one with (Fat joe Dr. Dre, Danny Hoch) and what appeared to be (Mafia Traitor) Al Pacino's* own son. Ill be damned if he didn't look like Michael Corleone-(Godfather)! That kid-( Eric Rivas) will blow up son!""Danny Hoch ""is known all over NY. A genius born and bred in this city! But if this becomes a cult classic which is what I predict. He should continue this into Whiteboyz 2. He is talented beyond comprehension. Bless you Dan keep going-we are proud. PS: see one of his shows live-He is mesmerizing! Keep it going Dan."
1,Never Receive,"I never received the CD, so I can't review it. If you can help me with this matter I'd appreciate it."
5,Very cool,"The Haunted Mansion is one of my favorite rides at Disneyland. I really enjoyed the stories in this comic. Some were humorous, others ""deadly"" serious. Some explained the history of a particular Haunted Mansion ghost, others were simply for fun. I plan to collect all the comics in this series."
1,Passionate but Shallow,"Mike Bickles shows us that being passionate about Jesus and writing about that passion are two different things. His enthusiasm is undeniable, however his book is repetitive and lacks insight. My advice: look elsewhere."
5,Mike Bickle shares God's heart with humor and candor.,"In an easy to read format Mike Bickle takes the reader on a journey, sharing his often humorous experiences on his quest to know God. I found this book encouraging; it shows that even if someone is ignorant of God's ways but is sincerely seeking Him, God will reveal Himself to them. The religious attitudes and stereotypes we may have in our minds are knocked down by the down to earth candor with which Mike shares."
5,lahdedah,NICE BOOK HAD WHAT I NEEDED THANKS FOR PROMPT SERVICE. NICE BOOK. HOPE TO FIND A FORTUNE IN STERLING BEFORE THE DOLLAR TANKS AND WE GO TO THE CAMPS.
4,A Warrior at Heart,"There are several books about the war exploits of movie and stage stars. I have read several and enjoyed them all. This one covers those who served in the Marine Corps. It is an easy read made up of many short chapters, each one covering a different star. If you follow the silver screen, stars or our participation in war you should enjoy it and learn from it."
2,We all make mistakes,"My mistake was when I ordered this book. I didn't do enough research so I didn't know that this book was targeting the 9-12 year old reader. Only 48 pages, a few photos, not very good ones. Avoid unless you're buying this for a ten year old."
3,Decent,"I found out about this author through one of his published short stories... I found his short stories to be more enjoyable. Still, this book is funny. I don't regret reading this book, but it didn't really change my life."
5,i definitely have seen a difference on my 8 month pit bull!,"i definitely have seen a difference on my 8 month pit bull! not only has shes gotten thicker but her coat is very shinny! she got sick for 3 days and wasnt eating much, she lost a lot of weight. two weeks into one tab a day and i saw an immediate weight gain"
3,Fair rating I guess. Read on.,"This is an OK watch. It has many or all the features of the more expensive watches at a good price. Cons: It is big. It eats batteries and takes two at a time. The degrees are in increments of five degrees. The buttons are near unreadable unless you color them somehow. The paint wears off immediately. It eats batteries like a mother but I understand they all do. It has something to do with it taking samplings every 5 seconds or something. Hard to find manual if you loose yours. Pros: The price. The features for the price. I paid $75, there may be other cheaper ones out there now. It has 3 alarms plus temp alarm and altitude alarm (if I read it correctly). I would say less than $50 would be a good deal if you want a watch that you do not have to worry about. I really have not worn it that much."
3,Huge NPT discharge & no adapter,"This may be the wrong solution for a residential sump. The discharge port is a whopping 1.5"" diameter and there exists no adapter that would make it fit my discharge hose, which is much smaller. However, I learned that I could easily convert a regular, 1/6 HP utility pump into an automatic sump pump simply by adding a tethered float switch. No hose adapter needed because the pump discharge is the right size to begin with.I wish I had known all this before purchasing the product. I was able to return this pump with no hassle, but it is a heavy beast, costly to ship."
1,Not Cast Iron - Plastic,"This is sold as a cast iron pump = - It even says on the box, cast iron - and I have bought several in the past and they were cast iron. However, this one is a cheap plastic pump made in China."
4,sump pump,Good established product. The price was good. I may order another pump from you if the prices do not go up.
5,A USA made Sump Pump,"Bought this pump to replace an old column pump that had failed. I looked at a similar type pump as a replacement, and found most of them to be made outside the US, and cheaply made. I wanted a USA made product that had a chance of lasting more than a few months. I called the factory and found out this one's made in Ohio. Seems to be built really well, and fit perfectly. So far so good. It pumps out my sump crock really fast. I would buy it again."
1,faucet spray does not fit standard skink,"so of course I tried to make the hole larger so it would slip on faucet but that just ruined the whole thing - I used to use these a long time ago, but they were not so stiff and more flexible and able to slip on a faucet"
2,Lots of eating,"This is a slow moving story filled with cooking, going to restaurants, food choices, eating, some shopping and sight seeing. Little focus on the characters. Arising conflict is given much less space compared to the eating."
4,"A balanced, articulate work","Carl Wedekind's thoughtful and scholarly yet accessible work on the death penalty is thought-provoking and myth-busting. Whether the reader is pro, anti, or undecided, anyone interested in matters of justice should put aside preconceived notions and read this important book."
4,A Very Merry Garfield Christmas,"Despite the fact that the Garfield comic strip seems to be heading in a downward spiral, the majority of the books still remain good, and this compilation is no exception. Printed in full color (even the daily strips) and containing all Christmas comics from 1978 to 2003 (as well as some cute drawings), this is the ultimate holiday collection for Garfield fans. This book is also unusual in that it reveals more of Garfield's soft side than ever before. As he said one Christmas day, ""Christmas. It's not the giving. It's not the receiving. It's the loving."" Happy Holidays!"
5,A CLASSY PRODUCTION,"Kid Peligro did a great job with this book. It is filled with rich insights and extremely readable.Yes, it is a celebration - not a critique or objective history, but a very well put together book.Apart from the wins and losses, it gives you some idea of the soul of the Gracies, a unique family like no other.Anyone vaguely interested in Brazilian Jiu-jitsu or the world of fighting should take a look.We need more books like this one!"
5,A Broad and Complete,If you have any interest in GJJ/BJJ or MMA this is a MUST READ!!! It will fill in the pieces of history that you most likely have heard parts of or not at all. This is the history of history makers.
5,An example of a great purchase.,"The book is pure gold for anyone interested in Jiu-jitsu and in martial arts history. I got a great deal and it arrived exactly as expected. I got it a few days before I met Royler Gracie and was able to get him to sign it after a BJJ class. I found the books description of Royler perfect. The man was as described, direct, friendly and knowledgeable. This book helps one to understand the people behind the most effective self-defense martial art in the world, and in that, it helps you to understand the art itself. I highly recommend the book as well as the seller."
1,Wow is this bad!!!,Forget it.The five star review is clearly written by Dino himself.Incomprehensible. Doesn't follow any rational order to explain things. Maybe it covers all the new features but you'll never figure out how to use them from this book
1,Mess,"The author doesn't introduce ASP.NET altogether. It's more about the differences and changes from ASP.NET 1.x to 2.0.The author doesn't follow a reasonable sequence and shows incomplete examples which do not compile.If you understand ASP.NET already, then MAYBE this book can help you. Otherwise expect to waste a lot of time trying to make things work like described in the book."
3,Decent Guide But Out of Date and Shallow,"This book is well written and covers most of the basics of ASP.NET 2.0. It is hardly complete, and several items are out of date and completely inaccurate when compared to Beta 2.I would recommend this book only as a supplement to other 2.0 materials, particularly the MSDN 2.0 articles."
5,Magical,"Another longtime Camel fan checks in: this cd is brilliant. I hesitate to call it their best because there have been so many highlights over the years, but ""A Nod..."" is truly magical, from the opening birds chirping and trains rumbling in to the last moment of the train leaving. It is difficult to pick out my favorite cuts because each one has such depth, emotional charge and beautiful changes that the whole cd must be listened to in order to appreciate what Mr. Lattimer and Co. have created. Others have compared certain songs to past work however I perfer to let each creation play out. Obviously inspired by the loss of the great Pete Bardens, Lattimer takes the Camel trademark so much further than before. His guitar and flute playing are inspired. The other musicians also shine and add great touches to the compositions. This is a great cd. Easily in the top 5 of the year. Do not hesitate for a second in picking it up, the rewards are plentiful."
3,After All These Years,"""A Nod And A Wink"" may not be as strong as its predecessor RAJAZ but it is a strong effort and a very pleasant listen for all camel fans. I highly recommend the purchase of the album to any progressive rock fan and note that the Import version of the album includes a great instrumental bonus track ""After all these years"" which is excluded in this version. Try buying the Import version to enjoy this great Camel song in addition to the finest moments such as ""Simple Pleasures"", ""A Boy's Life"" & "" For Today"". Andy Latimer's passionate playing still shine here. Long may you live CAMEL!"
4,Fun!,"These are cool- I've used them on their own, attached to the stroller, hanging in front of the car seat and attached to the Kushies shangrila playmat (I highly recommend the playmat!) and I've hung them from her bouncer. Each toy has a different feature/texture- the only one we haven't got much use out of is the one you're supposed to put a picture in. Originally, the ""squishy"" toy arrived sans water- but the exchange process was quick and painless. The favorite toy is the fuzzy mirror, unfortunately it was also the favorite of my dog :( but surprisingly it withstood his iron jaws!"
1,My Holiday Mailing Labels,"I bought this software program to use on my iMac because the platform requirements listed Mac OS X; however, when I received the product, it states on the front of the CD that it is only for use with Windows!! Non of the sellers specify whether their CD is for only Windows users or Mac users or both--why not?"
4,Another winner for Nagel & the Adams!,Another winner for Nagel. This book is as good as his other two about the Adams family. I still don't find Abigail very likeable. The pressure she put on her children to achieve broke 3 of them and the lone successful child (John Quincy) turned around and did the same with his children. I really enjoyed the writer's descriptions of Louisa. I hope to see a full blown biography of her someday...she deserves it! I gained a true understanding why John Quincy had the personality he did. Abigail was extremely intelligent and ahead of her time. I enjoyed reading of her true partnership with husband John.
3,It's alright.,Well it's a nice little handbook if your clueless about MIDI. If you know a little about MIDI then this is not the book for you. Most of MIDI you learn by playing around with it.
1,Junk,This lasted for about 3 times of wearing it. then it started pulling the material apart. Waste of money.
2,...,"i ordered this item, and reding the other review i expected good results however i havent seen any results at all. i have to say theres just no subistute for old fashioned exercise."
2,Knight and Hale Magnum Camoflage Crow Call,"I ordered 2 of these calls and would love to send them both back. I am an avid crow hunter and I am really disappointed in this purchase. The call sounds like a cheap kazoo and actually scares crows away. I have tried this product for approx 1 week and it's not worth the money. If you want a good quality call that sounds like a crow, then purchase another brand. Spend the extra money for a quality call and avoid being disappointed like me. This one is rated 2 stars from a credible crow hunter."
1,EXPENSIVE and LACKING!,This book is lacking some definitive bidding strategies (just read chapter 3) and is VERY expensive. I highly suggest other books on tax liens like Profit by Investing by Loftis (ISBN: 0793195179) or The Beginner's Guide to Real Estate Tax Lien and Tax Deed Auctions by Sausa (ISBN: 0978834607).Both are more comprehensive and are a lot cheaper!
3,A Very Dry and Tedious Account,"The lost memoirs by Marchand are important historically as they set the scene for Napoleon's demise, with multiple conspiracy theories.The problem is that these memoirs are really truly boring. For those who cannot sleep, read this book."
3,"Basic, but good-and definitely the right price","I bought my Satellite knowing that the Celeron was the bottom of the line processor...but all I was looking for was the ability to take a computer wherever I want, whenever I want. And that is definitely what my Satellite provides. If I want to play games or do more than scan the internet or check email, I have a beefier desktop that fits that bill. If you just want to stay connected to the internet and take care of your business on the run-this will do. The only disappointment is the battery life-it is very short. Can't stay disconnected from the AC too long, or it cuts off on you-pretty much 1 hour is it."
2,Look elsewhere.,"There are far better laptops on the market at this time (Jul 06). Here's what I don't like about mine.1. Gets VERY hot. If you're using it as a no-kidding laptop (i.e. on your lap) then you'll heat up along with this clunker.2. Too big and too heavy by today's standards.3. Battery life is terrible.4. Crappy motherboard. My motherboard died after 15 months. I'm still trying to salvage it, but so far having no luck.5. Construction is a bit clunky - always seems like the next time I open the laptop up, it's going to bust the hinges. Hasn't happened yet, but seems just moments away.If you pay more than $500 for this laptop, you're wasting money. Check eBay - go for something comparable around $500 - you can't do worse and will probably do better.As an aside, my work computer is a Toshiba Portege and I LOVE it. So, my specific problem is not Toshiba, but with this specific model."
1,Dont waste your money!,"This laptop is my first laptop, so maybe I have an unrealistic expectation, but the Toshiba Satellite is nothing but trouble for me.The battery life is terrible, you might get 45 minutes and that is if you are doing basic computing only.It gets very hot! I have taken this laptop back to be repaired 3 times because it over heats and shuts down after about 20 minutes.The screen is very flimsy, it will flop around 2-3"" in either direction when you have it open.I have also had to return it for repair of the AC adapter, they told me a wire came loose and had to be soldered back in place...I am no expert but wires dont just unsolder themselves!The hard dirve also took a dump once and whipped out everything I had.Overall I am completly dissatisfied with this machine and I will never buy a Toshiba product again!"
2,Will not buy another Toshiba Laptop,"I have the Toshiba Satellite A65-S1066, and have had nothing but problems with it. It's been sent to the shop multiple times for overheating and shutting down. Also, the hinges for the screen are very flimsy and have the ability to break easy. This product is becoming increasingly frustrating, I will not be purchasing another Toshiba laptop."
5,excellent,bought this on the recommendation of my groomer.......it does not get as hot as the metal ones......doing an excellent job
5,The Pro's Love It!,"I gave this set to my niece as a Christmas present, and she loves it! She's a professional ""extreme adventure"" guide, and said the tools would be an immediate addition to her ""kit"" that goes on every adventure, outing and expedition. Small, light weight, and invaluable tools..."
2,bad timing,"This book would probably be better accepted at another time. However I have trouble with a ex-officer saying and doing things that will tear down the moral of the soldiers fighting on the front line.There is a time and a place for this book and I'm sure 5 years from now, I might agree, however right now I find it's release I'll timed and inappropriate."
1,Roger,"This book only serves to reinforce the political views of those that read it. If you were against the war you're going to love it because it backs your view and makes you look smart. If you were for the war then it's purely a political scheme on the part of Clancy and Zinni and supports the left/liberal views. As I see it, the disgruntled former government employees are coming out of the wood-work to make a buck."
1,What a disappointment!,"Like many others, I heard the retired Marine on various television shows, talking about the war in Iraq and his vehement opposition to it and to the policies of the Bush administration. I was very interested in learning more about his feelings and how he came to them so I read this book, waiting for revelation that never came. This is an autobiography of a man who rose through the ranks of the Corps and his personal experiences during that time. There is nothing about the current war or the current administration. I kept reading it, even though, when I was half-way through it, he had only reached 1991 and I was having my doubts that he would ever get to the indictment I was looking for. I was right- he never did. This was a true waste of time for anyone looking for him to back up his assertions."
1,"Mr Clancy, what is this book about?","I was going to write a review but the June 3rd review from the reader in Austin, TX pretty well coveres the bases. I find it hard to believe Tom Clancy put his name on this book, he couldn't have even read it. While General Zinni was a truly outstanding Marine Corps officer he's no writer and his story suffers for this. At the conclusion of this book I had one question I kept asking, what was the real subject of this book as it meanders through Zinni's professional career from a young lieutenant through the multitude of staff jobs. While the points Zinni wants to make about integrity, speaking out, leadership could have been presented in a paragraph they are slowly, and with every imaginable military acronym, described in unimaginative detail. Pass on this one."
1,"Prostitution, vanity press and false advertising","This book brings to mind the words ""prostitution"" and ""Vanity Press"". Tom Clancy clearly prostituted himself by selling his name to a book he apparantly only skimmed and certainly didn't write, and ""Vanity Press"" because this book could not have been published without Clancy's name. Not only is the book poorly written, but it is little more than the constant drumbeat of Zinni's ego. While I am sure that anyone who earns 4 stars is a fine military officer, I am not interested in reading the litany of their ""Glory Days"" ramblings. To add insult to injury the book never delivers on the advertised Iraq/Vietnam analysis. The only part worth reading is the brief final chapter ""The Calling""--but do it in the bookstore."
3,Thats it..?,"""In the lead-up to the Iraq War and its later conduct, I saw at a minimum, true dereliction, negligence, and irresponsibility, at worse, lying, incompetence and corruption.""No description, no names, no real proof. Sure, we all know that the military has the same trappings as society, but I expected a little more in depth detail on the subject of ""Iraqi Freedom"" than just one general paragraph, given the face time he got in the press. This was no insiders critique, just a biography of a great man."
1,Book Radically Bad Departure for Clancy Fans,"Readers of Tom Clancy will not appreciate Clancy's radical departure from his normally conservative and common-sense style of writing. Retired Gen Zinni is a warrior diplomat who disagreed with the Bush Administration on the decision to attack Iraq and remove Saddam Hussein from power. He is in the minority of the military establishment and their support for the war, but he did strike a cord with Tom Clancy who, as he continually states, finds no `casus belli' or reason to go to war.So, if you disagree with the Bush administration and want to `pile on' read the book. Reader's looking for Clancy's normal fare should avoid this book and see if he returns to his writing conservative action novels."
4,Superb,"As a former member of the US Military it was my great pleasure to serve under General Zinni. He has impeccable credentials. As a conservative I find his outlook sobering. Partisans may knock the book, but they can only knock it as partisans, not as informed. I support President Bush, but not those who have failed in their leadership at the Pentagon.Zinni and Tom Clancy weave a classic and judging by it's reception with members of the military, it is on target."
4,Excellent for birding,"I selected this model because it is waterproof/fogproof (I live near Seattle), the zoom range, and the price (I seem to recall paying about $160 for it about five years ago). But the image quality seems quite wonderful. I can't explain technically why, but I've found images of birds to be amazingly sharp. Even something as common as a great blue heron or mallard is terrific to watch when you can enjoy a super clear, colorful image of them. I mostly stay at 20x, and find higher powers a bit challengeing to use (that's why I'm only giving four stars). I wish it could connect to my camcorder, but apparently scopes with that feature are much more expensive. Finally, I appreciate the hard and soft cases it comes with."
4,Quality optics at affordable price,"I've only had the opportunity to use this scope a few times so far, and only once for shooting, but have been very satisfied with it thus far. The optics are clear and easy to use, the scope is lightweight, and it appears to be well made. The optical adjustments are also easy to manipulate. The only shortcomings that I noticed is the lack of a taller tripod, which I've purchased separately, and a narrow field of view at the higher magnification levels. This I expected, though, without going to a much more expensive scope. I can't attest to the waterproof capabilities of the scope, since I wouldn't normally use this in inclement weather and haven't been caught in the rain with it yet."
3,Great for spying on the neighborhood,"We live on a cliff overlooking the city. We bought this to watch the firetrucks, police, and other goings-on below us. It works great for that purpose as long as you don't zook all the way in. The biggest issue I have had is figuring out how to mount this to the deck rail. There isn't a good ready made device for that purpose so I had to design my own. Really pleased with what I have now."
4,"Good, but not great.","I ordered this scope as either a new primary scope or backup depending on whether or not it was better than the one I already have. Well, turns out it will have to be a backup, as the field of vision is not as good as the scope I have. My original is over 30 years old, and I figured with new technology, my new one would surely be better. Not the case. The zoom is fine, focusing is fine. It's just that the field of vision is not up to par. I'll give it 4 stars because it was certainly worth the price, and does a better than decent job for my primary purpose... birding. I would still recommend it."
1,Disappointing to say the least!,"ConairPro Turbo-GroomIII kept this product (Dog Clippers) a while before rating it because being new at clipping dogs, I wanted to be fair. First of all this clipper will heat up to the can't touch at the head end of it at all (half the way through). Second it does not cut the dogs hair to my satisfaction. It certainly does not do well enough to do half of one large dog without heating up. It has been properly maintained, but doesn't even measure up to the job that my 30 year old Oster does that I had purchased many years ago to do kids hair. That one not being as big will take longer of course, but will trim a whole big dog well and does not heat up at all."
3,"Great idea, falls short","This is a very strong case. There are some problems. The inner sleeve retards the clicker movement, so much so, that I took an exacto knife and cut the spinwheel cover out. The 3 mm head phone jack hole isn't big enough for jacks that have a right angle, and I have to take the iPod out of the case every time I need to use specific jacks.The usb hole works well for direct iPod cords, but will not work if you are trying to dock it into a stand alone stereo/player.The clip that allows it to stand up is great. I have it placed right next to my HTC Thunderbolt that has a similar function.All in all, it has great concepts, but falls short. I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Disappointing and extremely frustrating,"I purchased this book mostly for it's coverage of Database driven webs and ASP. On first glance it appears there is excellent coverage. Unfortunately when it comes to actually following the examples and using the included code, the book and the disk are riddled with errors. None of the scripts work, and none of the scripts are included in their entirety on the disk. I searched the Osborne website for updates or downloads but nothing can be found. I eventually had to start looking for another book to buy."
3,"Gets to the point, covering intermed. to adv. topics, but...","I like this book very much. Sections get right to the point; more often then not covering intermediate to advanced concepts and ideas.One of the reasons I purchased the book was the coverage of database driven webs. As a college teacher looking for a textbook for a Fall 1999 class, I dug right in and tried your step-by-step dB exercises. The Chapter 10 stuff went well. Being familiar with ASPs, I read through Chapter 11 so I could get to what I was really interested in, Chapter 12 ('Integrating ASP into Your Webs'). Here I encountered much frustration.It seems that the pain, and gain, is in the details. While I learned a lot fixing the errors in Chapter 12, I wonder if your readership might not benefit from an errata sheet, possibly Web based. I did search the Web for one, but found none.I wish I could inform the author of the Chapter 12 (pgs. 467-473) errors, but I can't find an Email address for him, not even at his own company."
4,Great Tips on Customizing FrontPage Components,"This book really gave me some great insight into what goes into the FrontPage components. I was able to create items using the built-in components, and then customize them right in the code. All the webbot code was shown and explained in the book giving me a good idea of what FrontPage was doing, and how I could change it."
5,The is the best Frontpage 2000 book around,"I cannot beleive how informative this book was. I have read several other books on the subject but none came anywhere near this book.Very clear, the author was thinking about his audience when he wrote this book."
3,Frontpage 2000,Bought it because i was using frontpage to help a business owner develop a website for his company. It was worth it while it lasted. Now many programs are becoming obsolete but it was considered a cheap buy.
2,A big dissappoinment!!!!,"I bought the book based on the Amazon.com reviews and reader's feedback..one very important lesson i learned is this: Before buying a book on-line, go to a bookstore and review it first. Make sure it meet your specific requirements. In addition, don't just look at the Table of Contents. Don't rely exclusively on the vendor's reviews and reader's feedback.To me, this book presented just an overview of too many subjects (ADO, ActiveX, ASP, etc). A sort of jack of all trades.I am returning this book and get something else.."
5,VERY SHARP AND HARD,"I bought this bit to cut a decorative edge in kitchen moldings. The molding will be installed above and below the upper cabinets. The wood I cut was hard maple. This bit cut flawlessly, making smooth shapes with minimal tearout. Some of the wood I ran thru this bit was substandard, having a lot of tearout on the jointer. I saved some of the substandard pieces for the upper moldings where they aren't readily visible. This bit cut well thru the substandard grain pieces. This bit is hard to find, with the vast majority of bits this style having a flat plane between the radius bumps. Very nice looking profile."
4,what are the alternatives?,"If you want an introduction to the philosophy of music, this is the best book available. To some degree, that's because there are no real alternatives. The writing is clear and it really does give an overview of the issues that philosophers discuss, but that means it concentrates on ""pure"" music (instrumental music of the European classical tradition). The ONLY discussion of music with words is the chapter on opera. If you don't already know a lot about opera, you'll be lost following that chapter. Compared to most philosohers, Kivy has a very informal writing style."
4,This is a great set for the money,"If you don't want to spend allot of $$$ on one of these grill sets; this is the way to go. For the $$$ you Can't Beat the Quality. In fact, I think it's better quality for the $$!"
2,Outdated,"The book is presented like it is current, but the advice is so outdated that its almost not worth it. There may be a more current version out there but I couldn't find it."
2,Don't Buy This For Your Wife,"My husband bought this book for me because he thought it would be interesting or helpful. While there are some things in this book that are worth reading there are many many others that arn't. It is a dry book that spends far to much time on the details of such things as ""ivitations"" and ""table settings."" I never knew that twenty pages could be written on such dull topics as ""introductions"" and ""calling cards."" This book is out of date and even slightly insulting when read by a modern working twenty-first century army wife."
4,question,"ok so can anyone just talk about the book instead of their life. Does this book help me out with all the army ways, abbreviations, rank, and all that good stuff I want to know as a fairly new army wife???? I just want to know how it all works and the basic knowledge of the army."
2,A Good Book IF....,"..you have some time to kill. I am a former enlisted wife(dh just crossed over to the other side) and I do agree with some of the other reviewers that these ""how to follow military protocol"" books really are geared towards officers' wives."
4,Not Everyone Needs This Book...But Then Again,"I am the wife of a lower enlisted soldier and thought I would never need this book after reading the first few chapters while my hubby was in AIT...BUT then I became a FRG Leader at his first duty station and it became my bible. There is a lot of good information in this book, and you don't have to be an Officer's wife to need to know the proper way to address a Christmas Card. You only need respect for the protocols and traditions of our beloved Army !!"
2,Too much etiquette! Not enough useful advice!,"I purchased this book when my husband first enlisted. I wanted to know what life would be like in the army for me, the spouse. This book was such a disappointment that I promptly put it back up for sale! I didn't even bother to finish it. Now, I know that it's a ""social guide"" and it's probably helpful in its own way, (the only reason that it got two stars) but I wouldn't say that it's a must have for every military wife. There's so much more that we need to know as wives, so much more than just how to act at a ball. My advice to all military wives would be to spend your money on other ""military wife handbooks"" that will be useful in times other than social ones. Believe me, you'll use those other books far more than you will this one."
1,Not as described,"Although the book was the correct item ordered, it was described as ""good."" There is blue dye ink on the edges of all pages and lots of noticeable use. It was not described correctly."
5,"intuitive to use, thoughtful design","This thermostat functions just as a programmable should. It is easy to program, all the key info is on the display, and it's easy to enter ""hold"" mode and such, when you need to deviate from the program.Its intuitive design also makes it easy for me to quickly instruct others on its use. My elderly parents have no problem quickly understanding the operation. I replaced a Hunter due to this ease-of-use issue and I couldn't be happier with the Honeywell.UPDATEFeb 2013. Still working great. And I have installed 3 others in other zones and in parent's house. Still the best balance of functionality and ease of use that I've seen."
4,Very pleased with this thermostat,"I have had this thermostat for almost a year, and I really like it. It is very easy to program, and for the most part, once you set it where you want it, you won't have to touch it again. If you want to turn the heat up or down off the set schedule, it is just a matter of a few button touches. As far as the click the other reviewer mentioned - yes, there is a click when the heat turns on. I cannot see how this would be a deterrent from buying the product though. My manual thermostat clicks as well, and honestly that little click is a lot less noise than when the heat actually starts coming out of the baseboards!"
5,Programable Dream!!!,"I purchased two Honeywell 5-2 Day Programable Thremostats for my home. They were easy to install. However, you will need a small screwdriver like the one found in an eyeglass repair kit, which is not supplied. The thremostats are working perfectly and allow one to temporarily adjust the programmed settings instantly with the touch of a button. I highly recommend this thermostat."
4,"Easy to install, Easy to use","This product is great. It wasn't that expensive, it was super easy to install, took me about 10 minutes. The display is clear and very easy to use. The programming is easy to setup. I just used the stock programs and am very happy with it. The click heard when it turns on the services is loud enough to hear in the next room, but only if your listening. Plus it's not like it happens that often anyway."
1,Unit already has broken,"Not sure how long I have had this thermostat, but already it is failing. Replaced the batteries today and now it will not reliably stay on, much less accept re-programming. Something like this should last many years, and this one has not."
5,"Honeywell Thermostat, accurate and good price","I am pleased with the product, easy to set up and use. I looked at feedback and it was recommended, so far very pleased."
1,Bad Product Bad Customer Service,"The Honeywell Thermostats promote themselves as having clear backlit displays. That's not always or exactly true. To get backlighting on some / most models I've encountered you must press one of the keys for the display to light up, essentially defeating the purpose. The one I purchased - not from Amazon - lost time like the other reviewer's did. It could never correctly read the ambient temperature and would not turn off the heat. I had it professionally installed to make sure it would be installed correctly.Customer Service is offshored. They listen. They have no suggestions. You escalate your inquiry and they try to ""handle"" you. The email address they give you for follow-up does not respond.Save yourself time, money and aggravation and buy something else. I simply reinstalled my old mercury bulb unit. Like clockwork, it turn's the heat on and off and keeps the temperature where I need it to be."
4,Great conclusion to the saga.,"I've enjoyed all of the Avatar series with my boys, who are now young teens. Avatar gave them a safe place to explore issues of fear, responsibility, morality, religion and the importance of attitude. That, and it was a lot of fun!Anyone reading this review (for Book 3) already knows how much delightful the animation and the martial-arts-inspired fiction of ""bending"" can be. I'll just say that the writers and animators did a marvelous job of bringing this saga to a close, resolving all of the most important themes, elements and conflicts."
4,great story & animation,"The Last Airbender series is really well done. The animaiton captures the spirit and the environment of the story very well. The story itself is engaging and interesting, with lots of excitement as well as fun along the way. I recommend this highly!"
4,Good movie,"Video quality is good. My little brothers really love this series. The subtitles are sometimes wrong or missing, I don't know if it is my pressing or what. The case does not hold two of the discs securely; they can fall out if not careful. All in all totally worth owning!"
5,Avatar: The Last Airbender - The Complete Book Three Collection,These books are great. My family really enjoyed the TV show so it was great for the kids to read the books also. Highly recommended.
5,Avatar: The Last Airbender - The Complete Book 3 Collection,"This is my favorite cartoon TV series. This final collection offers you great action sequences, laugh out loud comedy, untold back stories and an epic final battle between the Avatar and the Firelord. This collection also offers you a bonus disc. Avatar the Last Airbender is awesome. Buy it if you don't have it!"
1,Great show lacking digital quality,"Love the show, but watching it at this level of quality is something that should not be done, if you want a digital copy wait if not then get the dvds.http://www.amazon.com/Avatar-Last-Airbender-Complete-Collection/dp/B001AI7766/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1335265435&sr;=8-2"
3,Don't judge the series from this episode,"Probably the stupidest episode of the entire series. Oh well, still enjoyed watching it."
5,best animated series for kids and adults,This is by far the most thoughtful character driven goofy delight of a children's cartoon that has ever been made. Our family is halfway through the 3rd season and already mourning that this is the final season.
2,Sigh...,"This episode would have gotten five stars from me, but it had gaping plot holes and annonsensical ending. I did like the Zuko/Katara interaction as well as Katara's argument with Aang.First of all, who told Yon Rha that there was still a Waterbender left in the Southern Tribe? This is never cleared up, and it would have greatly helped the story if Yon Rha had said where he got his information.Secondly... for Katara to just walk away after confronting Yon Rha was the biggest cop-out I've seen on this show. This jerk MURDERED her mother and she doesn't even beat him around at the very least. After all the work she and Zuko did in finding this slimeball, and they just let him off scot-free? I know this is a kid's show, but this was so unrealistic and unsatisfying."
5,Awesome!,"I am very happy with this product. It came on time, was a brand new package, and was in fantastic condition. I have no complaints about it at all. Thanks!"
5,Better Than The Movie,"On the 3rd and final season of the series the story continues to improve and the animation is definitely of a higher quality. Mostly everything is better and improved except the final two or three episodes where things seemed a little rushed especially in the final episode where scenes jump from one situation to another. Otherwise, I'll still say that this is a refreshing show to watch."
3,Good episode for what it's worth,"I have to disagree with the other reviewer who said it was stupid. I think this play episode serves several purposes. It is the episode right before Aang faces the Fire Lord, so it gives some comic relief from all the fighting, etc. It also shows everything that has happened up until this point which is cool so you know what happens, etc. I think this was very smart of them to make, I enjoyed it."
5,Better than the live action movie,"This series is masterfully written. The characters are consistently funny and true to form. The plot continues to move forward with occasional diversions. The ending is fantastic, but still leaves some unanswered questions to make you wonder and find your own conclusions.Nicely tied together."
5,Great Gift!,If you love the Avatar series you will not go wrong with this purchase! It's definitely on it's way to becoming a classic!
5,Loved it,"Loved every minute of it. Character and plot development are awesome, with an incredible mix of humor and drama. And the fight scenes are animated breathtakingly"
5,EPIC!!!,"Excellent condition for an excellent price. The finally of this season was totally unexpected. Unfortunately, it also leaves a huge cliff hanger. overall, it was great."
3,"Great series, missing commentary","The series is great, the image quality on this is much better than the 1st season DVDs, but the bonus commentary tracks that were supposed to be included for the Sozin's Comet episodes are missing. I had Amazon send a replacement, and it was the same case. The 4th disc that is packaged with certain copies of this box set is actually the disc from the separate Volume 4 release, which doesn't have the bonus commentaries."
3,Would have,I would have given this a great review if every single didn't have scratches on it! I mean one or two would have been acceptable but every disc?! what the hell!?
5,Wonderfully driven storyline! Highly recommended!,"My six year old daughter got me started on this story. I am very happy she did as it has been an enjoyable time for both of us to share. The humor, sarcasm, emotion, coming of age, depth, and the complex characters and storyline define it as one of the best animated series I've seen to date. I do not bestow this compliment lightly, as a fortysomething year old mom who loves animation with a brilliant storyline...this says something. Needless to say, I am planning to collect the series."
5,Avatar: The Last Airbender (TM) Book 3,"This simply wraps up this epic journey into one clean well done dvd pack. Its full of Bonus material that real fans of the show that have watched it Nick will enjoy. And for anyone who is looking to buy this, 1. you really need to get the other two first. 2. You will not regret it, totally worth the price (At least amazon's price)"
5,Avatar Aang <3,"I love this series, it's not even funny. This series, taught me so much. This is one of the things that make me so happy, I grin ear to ear. And that's really hard to do."
5,Season 3 brings it all together,"Season 3 is by far the best one. By this point, everyone has a story and brings something different to the table. Everything begins to wrap up and lead to the season finale. The perfect blend of humor, action, suspense, and fun. A must see! (after the other two seasons, of course)"
3,Where's the bonus commentary?,I love this show but for some reason my box set is missing the bonus commentary for the the Sozins Comet episodes. THis is the second set that I have purchased that was missing this so I think it must be a manufacturing error. I am pretty bummed because I was really looking forward to it. If anyone knows why the commentary is missing let me know.
5,Simply great...,"I started watching avatar season 1 on T.V. and unfortunately missed quite a few episodes and decided to order the complete season 1 on DVD. I enjoyed it so much that I also purchased seasons 2 and finally 3 (all from amazon in case you're wondering). Season 3 is great and completes the storyline nicely leaving only one loose end that I noticed (I won't spoil it for anyone). The only thing bad I can think of about season 3 is knowing that there won't be a season 4. This series was one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of watching and if you enjoyed season's 1 and 2 then I'm sure season 3 won't let you down. It's got all the goofy comedy, epic battles, and great character / story development that Avatar fans have come to expect from this wonderful series."
5,Best cartoon I ever watched,"My 5 year old absolutely loves this show. It teaches some VERY good morales. I wish every kid would watch this. The world would be a better place. If you have a 4-5 year old boy, you should buy the whole season. It will be the best investment you ever made in his future."
3,"5 stars for the series, 1 for the packaging","Im not sure what happened but the binding material used to attach the dvd holder to the case was dried and cracked when i got it so the dvd holders and dvds fell out, the show was great though"
2,Just filler,"The end of this season (and series) left quite a few questions to be answered, and this episode should have been used to answer them. Instead all we got was this filler with a lot of nonsense in it. I found this a bore to sit through, wondering when I would actually learn something new."
3,love the theme behind the story.,I don't care for the animation part. I thought it was real people playing in the movies not cartoons. Its very attractive and u get sucked in and enjoyed watching them. But I really liked it when it wasn't cartoons! A movie with real actors like the last air Bender.
2,subtitles and language issues,"Is a problem, if the book 1 and book 2 have several languages and the book 3 don's have that specification....Is annoying that inconvenient...Don't misunderstand me, the serie is one of my favorite, I have book 1 and 2, but I have to think about if I have to buy the season 3. So, I have to wait until it come out (if come out) a book 3 collection with Spanish language."
2,NOT A GOOD WAY TOO END A GOOD SERIES,"Personally I thought this season kinda sucked and the ending was a big letdown. I loved the First Season and even thought the Second Season storyline was slow as hell with a lot of filler episodes, it did do well in the character development leading into the final season making season 2 good for what it was. This season 3 was just all over the place and I was just waiting for it to get to the awesome epic end battle. Well the battle wasnt epic and the writing up to it was kinda lame."
5,Chips 99' Great Movie for the old show,Great low budget movie. I've been a Chips fan ever since i was a little kid growing up in the 80's. I used to watch it with my father. I'm only 30 years old and i still watch the shows reruns on my dvd set. I used to watch the reruns also on tnt back in the late 90s. Anyway about the movie it brings back the characters from the show. You get to see them years later. The movie is about some car thieves. If you loved the show than you should buy this movie........
5,Just Wonderful!,We just watched it on Christmas day and thought it was great to see those two hunks in action again!! I think it's neat when past actors come together to do another movie later in life. Helps you to catch up on what they look like now and brings back memories from their series years ago.
5,Two thumbs up!,"Not even the years passed away, can take away the emotion of the great adventures and the running adrenaline of the CHiP's series! Jon and Ponch are definitely the winning couple to bring back them in this awesome movie CHiP's 99! Two Thumbs Up!"
5,In the year 2011- Wouldnt it be nice to have the option of DVD,"This is a great movie and I enjoyed every minute of it. I was a chips fan from the age of 6. I grew up wanting to be a Police Officer, and just loved every episode of this show. Years and years later when CHIPS 99' came out, I was excited to no end! There are so many people out there who were, are, and will always be fans of this exceptional series. There will never be another show like it. Unfortunantly, not many people have a working VHS player today. This is the 3D and Blue-Ray age.... 2011, and the powers that be need to please consider releasing this show on DVD and or Blue-Ray Disc."
5,A must have for the CHiPs fan,I grew up with CHiPs but for many years missed their series on television. Thanks to this Video I can relive some of those memories. The guys are wearing well in this movie! A outstanding product and service from Amazon.
2,Background for fishtank,I was terribly disappointed in this. Not as it appears online. I put it in back of the tank and my tank is crystal clear.....could not even make out the blue color. Not worth the money. Plus there was a crease down the middle. I had to send it back for a refund. I ended up buying a boulder scene at my local pet supply store for five dollars.Sometimes it's hard to see things as they really are online. I would not recommend this product .
2,Its not as described,The description said it had two backgrounds for the price of one. Its supposed to have an aquatic scene on one side and a shalescape on the other side. The one I got only had one scene and the other side was plain blue.
3,Needs to be cheaper,"I bought this to protect the trout in my aquaponic tanks from ""prying eyes."" It works well after we cut out around the plants to keep what we wanted. Way too expensive to be useful."
1,The only person who profited from this book is Garth Turner.,"This book is proof positive that no-one can predict the future.This guy was involved in politics on a high level, owned a variety of real estate and still had no clue what would happen.Many in the baby boom crowd that I know are very well invested and have their homes paid off, not sure we will fall off a cliff necessarily. Always use government statistics to check out author's claims if you can.One thing I CAN agree on about property valuations today. For the quality/cost of house you buy today, the land portion can be ridiculous (feudalism next?).If you want a strategy to weather all storms try Fail-safe investing by Harry Browne AS A START."
1,Awful Waste of Money,"Six dollars? For some fifteen or twenty pages, half of which tell us ""how to use"" them and another few which have nothing to do with the subject matter? This is the most scandalous rip-off I've seen. And a terrible waste of money. I couldn't have imagined it."
4,"Como casi todos los primeros albumes de Serrat, muy recomendable","Grabado en 1969, La Paloma, el cuarto album de la discografia oficial de Serrat, y el primero en idioma castellano, probablemente este por debajo de Mediterraneo y Dedicado a Antonio Machado, para mencionar dos excelentes albumes de Serrat de esa primera y brillante época, pero sigue siendo un album mas que recomendable. Varias de las canciones de este disco se mantienen en el repertorio de Serrat despues de cuatro décadas: El titirirero, Poco antes que den las diez, Tu nombre me sabe a Yerba, Penelope. Otras canciones muy buenas son En cualquier Lugar, Mis Gaviotas y Manuel."
1,Not Worth Your Money or Your Time,"To put it simply, this book does not help you prepare for the PRAXIS test on Vocational General Knowledge. The questions I got on the actual test were nothing remotely like the questions in this prep book. If you haven't got a strong background knowledge in the field from your college classes - in both Vocational Tech as well as Educational Methods, etc. - then you're going to have a hard time passing the test... because this kind of prep book will not prepare you for what you really need to know/show.Hate to break it to you!"
1,Not worth it,This adapter is HUGE compared to many others on the market and it broke within the first couple weeks. I would not recommend this to anyone.
4,Not bad for the money spent,"I used this scope to spot hits on a target. I was concerned about clarity from distances up to 200 yards away. I was surprised that I was able to spot hits at 200 yards from a .223 round. I used floresent target dots on the black background targets to help with sighting and to aid the scope. If you plan to go beyond 200 yards, you need to invest a little more to get better optics. If 200 yards is your maximum, then this scope will do the job. The hard and soft cases are a nice addition."
4,truly gripping reading for sociology!,"as an asian american, the type of themes discussed here are fascinating, particularly for those of us who are both hyphenated americans of any sort. as well of fascination is the whole concept of being in between generations, such as 1st, 2nd, etc. but this book points out that one can even be a fractional generation. in asian cultures such as japan, china, and korea, there are actual words which identify what generation of ethnicity one is in a new land, and this book reinforces this. a great read for anyone who claims identity between 2 or more cultures."
5,Cool Game!,"People who don't like tennis will love Mario Tennis! When you beat the Star Cup, you will get either DK Jr. or Waluigi. Note: Waluigi is the best player in the game."
5,"GREAT, ADDICTIVE, FUN FOR EVERYONE!!","This game is so much fun! My relatives, parents, siblings, and I can't stop playing! This game is so addictive. It is fun even playing alone! There are so many characters to choose from and you can even choose a doubles partner! Playing this game is a great way to learn how to play tennis plus the rules of tennis!This game has tournaments, and all sorts of different fun games to choose from. I recommend this game for everyone."
1,Mario Tennis! hehehe...that was a good one so Now reallY...,how can anyone come up with such an idea...? This game is az bad az the new PONG ...all U do is playing with a ball left and right ..basically it is JUST like PONG(the first video game ever..remember those two white lines and a sequare) except that Mario is hitting the Ball with a Racket ...in one BORING back ground (well sometimes there is a photo of a character on the ground for excitement)...the only good thing about most SPORT based games was their use of famouse players (aghasi) ...but NINTENDO solved that problem by using Mario and donkey kong instead...and took that little token of Joy from the game...this game is very sad ...and as far as BUYING it goes let me put it this way...If this game came free in the mail it was still too expensive...
3,A cheating game,"I put the title as ""a cheating game"" because it DOES cheat. It is so fun to me only if I play 2 player mode. The 1 player mode cheats, you know. It cheats because I'm a expert of the game and I go to tournament and I finshed Mushroom cup and Flower cup. I moved to Star cup, and it cheats! If it's easy, it let's you win. But, if it's hard, it let's the computor WIN! I played it and it let's the computor win. I never won. I only got 15 points and the computor gets 50. It's not fair. I loose when ever I play 1 player. It's so fun, though. I'm not saying it's bad, but it is fun."
3,"Good, but 1 Player is boring...","I think that the game is good when you have other people playing, but after you practice the game and you master the tennis shots, one player mode becomes easy. After easily starring each player, a surprise will come, but it isn't all that great. I think that if you don't have people over, this game will be no fun at all after you beat it."
4,Pretty Good game,"Pros: variety of characters with varied abilities, 1-4 Players, Can add extra characters from the Game Boy Color version, Has tournament games, mini games, and many different courts, Also has easy to learn controls, Cons: Can get frustrated at game"
3,Nintendo does it again.....,"Once again, Nintendo has taken a popular sport and put their spin on it. This time out it is tennis, and Mario and pals show up to make a fairly entertaining game.The physics/action of Mario Tennis are true-to-life, and the graphics are impressive. The player can choose from quite a cast of characters, including a ghost, to hit the courts with.There are several modes of playing, which keeps things interesting, especially if you are solo. As usual with nintendo, there are some mini-games. Wow, right?Overall, Mario Tennis is a fun game that I would imagine most video game fans would enjoy. It is easy to pick up and start playing, and the controls are fair. Make no mistake, there isn't too much depth here, but it is still an entertaining game."
5,Very Fuuny and cool game,This game by camalot is great. It is very funny and addicting. Once you start playing you don't want to stop! Hitting the oppenet with the ball is funny to. Camalot did a smashing job!
2,stupid,"This game is simply ridiculous. I think that the whole idea of virtual tennis is stupid. It is a very complicated game(tennis). Mario tennis does not give you the control that you need for tennis. If you like tennis, than get off your butt and go fing a tennis court, get a raquet and play REAL tennis.anyhoo, back to the game, It's a little fun but it has no longevity."
4,Fine. Just fine.,"It was all right. Too short, too, easy, but a very fun game. Good for newbs. I wouldn't recommend this one for the elite gamers looking for a challenge. This is a game for lax gamers."
5,"Mario Tennis: Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun","Alright, can we just set aside the fact right now that Mario Tennis is an awesome game with great graphics and easy to learn controls and that you should buy it right now? Because I want to tell you something funny that happened with this game.There are 2 human females in this game: Princess Peach and Daisy. In our family, my step-dad pretends that princess peach is soooo beautiful just to make us all laugh. So we were playing mario tennis doubles one day, I was Peach (just so I could talk in an annoying high-piched voice) and my sister was Daisy. In the middle of the game, we pretended Peach was jealous of Daisy because her boyfriend was Luigi, and we made them both come to the net and start fighting! It was one of the funniest things I have ever seen.In short, this game is not only good for gaming, it's good for fun creative entertainment. You have got to try it, your family will LOVE IT!"
4,Tennis,This is a wonderful play. Its great for the nintendo 64 old school gamer. Plenty of players to choose from and can be played with up to 4 people. Simple controls as well. Great game Well Done!!
4,Pretty Good,"I would prefer playing Mario Golf instead.Mario Tennis:sound- 8/10graphics- 9/10satisfaction- 9/10game design- 9/10play control- 8/10Avg. 8.5/10Mario Golf:sound- 10/10graphics- 9/10satisfaction- 10/10game design- 9/10play control- 9/10Avg. 9.5/10Thhese are of course, my ratings. I own many games, so you can count on me to help. Buy Nintendo Power for more help."
5,Mario Tennis is awesome!,"Mario Tennis is an addictivly fun game, even for gamers who don't like Tennis at all, or older gamers who don't really like Mario games. It only took me one game to get used to all the controls and really good, and in no time at all I was playing the hard level (it might not be that easy for you, i'm just an expert gamer). Don't start thinking that it's going to be TOO easy, though! The advanced levels are very challenging, and once you get good, you can move up levels and try and get secret characters and courts, as well as play with friends on multi-player. This is a REALLY fun game so go and buy it today!"
5,Cool tennis game,This game rocks! I rented it and just had to go out and buy it. This is by far one of the best games out for the N64. The graphics are superb for N64 and the gameplay is outstanding! YOU MUST BUY THIS GAME!!
5,TENNIS WITH A TWIST,"mario tennis is a great game. it's fun to learn, play and master. i have beaten all there is to beat in singles, got the two extra characters (DK jr, and shyguy), got the extra ability level(MAX-higher than intense),and a few extra courts and am still having a blast with this game. Its definetely a keeper!"
5,I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!,"Mario tennis is awesome! I had just started playing tennis when I heard that Nintendo was coming out with This game. The Game play is great. I really like the courts. The clay one is tough to play on, though. I reccomend this game to Every gamer in the USA!!!!!!"
3,Fun but tooooo easy!,"This game is somewhat good, but it is too easy. When I first played it, it was fun, but in 3 days you could easily defeat all 3 cups. Multiplayer is pretty good overall. But these game is not worth buying. Rent it for a couple a days to entretain yourself a little. But don't buy it, because after a week you'll be bored of it. Graphics are OK, and the gameplay is really good. It definetly did not keep up with my expectations."
1,Not the Original!,"If you are simply tring to research this unprecidented moment in space exploration, this photo-copied book will help you. I stress the item for sale is a B&W; copy-no glossy pages, no color photos.In my opinion, the item offered here is a cheap, inferior product."
1,Do not buy this scope,"Hi,I've been an amateur astronomer for over 30 years. Do not waste a dime on this scope. It is USELESS and will end up in a closet collecting dust.Hope I've save you money and time."
4,Novice Refractor Telescope,"Bought for my 14 year old astronomer, it gives him the ease of use needed with the expanded possibilities of additional optics choices."
4,A comprehensive introduction of E-business.,"It's really a comprehensive book for novice who wants to learn the concept of E-business from scratch. It gives reader a wide spectrum of themes on business of e-commerce. Wade though it, and you will find yourself filled with e-business wisdom."
1,Missed the mark...,I got this only because I felt that Michael and Theresa needed more and I wasn't done reading about them. I didn't care for Gemma in this one at all and the witch thing totally turned me off. She didn't fit with Sean. They weren't endearing at all.
5,TOTAL RUSH- ANOTHER HIT FOR MARTIN!,"I read this entire book in one sitting. Deirdre Martin has done it again. Her writing reminds me of a cross between Rachel Gibson and Susan Elizabeth Phllips. I highly recommend this book, as well as her two other books. The main character Gemma is the cousin of Michael Dante from Fair Play. After being set up on a blind date with a NY Blade that was a total flop, she and her friend Frankie, try to cast a little love spell. She ends up butting heads with her firefighter neighbor and before too long a spark ignites a fire between them. The story is about two seemingly different people finding each other and experiencing the ups and downs of love. There is a little hockey action in this book (charity game b/w the NYFD and the Blades), but the firefighting scenes and inside view of life in the firehouse are wonderful. The characters make you smile, laugh and cry. This book is a must read. I can't wait for Deirdre Martin's next book!"
1,Terrible,"This is the first book I've read by Deidre Martin, and it will be the last. The two central characters are believable personalities, but definately not a believable couple. They are so mismatched that I couldn't bring myself to even finish the book. I tried, I even made myself read more than 200 pages before I gave up, and I don't think I've ever done that before."
1,Very disappointing!!!,"I enjoyed the first two books by this author. But this book was sooooo bad. I couldn't even find anything interesting in this book. The lead characters were just walking around blind and other than a one night stand I don't see what they had that would keep them together. The whole thing read like a jumble of stories thrown together. May be the next book will be better, but this was not third time the charm."
2,Very Disappointed!,"I really enjoyed the other books I read by this author, but this one was a BIG disappointment! First off, the lead characters sleep together almost immediately - which would have been fine if I had sensed some sort of great passion between them. The whole book left me cold, and almost depressed, as one thing after another prevented these 2 from getting together. If I had wanted to read something sad and drama-filled, I would NOT have chosen a 'supposed' romantic read. NOT what I was hoping! Not sure if I'll read this author again."
4,AWESOME STORY,I loved this book.. I thought the book was interesting with just enough spice. I thought some parts about the Grandmother were a little long but otherwise the book was great and a fun read.
2,Not a Page Turner!,"This is the fourth Diedre Martin romance I've read, and I have to say the worst. The chemistry between the two main characters, Sean and Gemma, is barely believable. I've read authors that can take a man and a woman at opposite ends of the spectrum and, with really great characterization, circle them around to one another until they -quite believably- fall in love and head toward a long life together. Susan Elizabeth Phillips is a master at this. Dierdre Martin is not. Beyond that, be prepared for scene after scene where the two main characters don't interact. The subplots are too thick and too boring. I agree, if this is your first Dierdre Martin novel, don't give up hope. The others aren't this bad. I did end up finishing this, but only because I'm obsessive compulsive about finishing what I start, not because the book is a page turner!"
1,Total Disappointment,"This book is just another trashy romance novel, unfortunately. The characters lack depth and the story is basically just a conglomeration of different opportunities to describe another sex scene. The story is not even compelling enough to wade through the tacky cliched love scenes, and finishing the book is a task to the patient reader. This book's only redeeming quality is the colorful cast of characters- if they had been more fully developed this story might have been more worthy."
2,"Not recommended. Too much family drama, not enough romance.","Overall I thought this book really missed the mark. First of all, too much of the story focused on her crazy family -- a horribly mean mother and a grandmother who needs so much care that it sucks the life out of everyone. It wasn't at all interesting, and worse it wasn't even intrical to the romance story. Just depressing. Then there was a LONG break in the romance - at least 100 pages. He was a bit of a jerk and an idiot, and not the typical romance novel heart throb. She and him were not a good fit, no matter how hard the author tried to make the ""opposites attrack"" concept work. I could never believed for a second their romance would ever work. I would not recommend this book."
5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"This third book of Deirdre Martin's proves once again what a fabulous writer she is. Total Rush is the continuation of her series (however each book can stand alone!) with the heroine being Gemma Dante (Michael's cousin)! The quirky owner of a new age store in NYC happens to have a hot new neighbor, firefighter Sean Kennealy! Everything sure heats up when her fun and witty life blazes right into Sean's fireman brotherhood life! Deirdre does a wonderful job having opposites attract while making the entire story believable as well as loving and caring.The chemistry with these two characters is so hot and the emotion will make your got churn then smile. You can't help but laugh at the perfect ways she captivated many fireman's lives! My words simply do not book this the justice it deserves. The main word that comes to mind is simply FABULOUS! :-)"
1,Total Drag,"I was so disappointed in this book. I liked her first book, and I thought the second was ok. When I read the back of this one I thought it looked good. I'm a witch, a major hockey fan, and I come from a big Italian-Irish family filled with cops and firefighters. Those are the themes of this book, so I thought I'd love it. Wrong! It was really terrible. Ms. Martin is actually a good writer, but this story was so uninteresting. Gemma and Sean hook up and get physical way too soon. They have nothing in common and can't communicate so they break up. Then they are broken up for over a 100 pages while Gemma deals with some pretty serious family issues. Of course, they eventually get back together, but my question is why? All they seem to have in common is sex. This is not my idea of romance. I honestly can't see these two actually having a real relationship."
2,This Book Is A Disappointment,"I thought from the topics covered, and the approach to the topic, that this book had significant potential. However, it was so poorly executed, I stopped reading without even getting halfway through.Much of the discussion that takes place in the so-called ""case studies"" include opinions of people who are writers, journalists, psychologists, etc, who have made no special study of ethics or morality. If I want the opinions of average people, I can talk to my friends.I was hoping this book would have some insight, and to a certain extent, this is provided in the first section. But beyond that, this book is of little use. I will need to look elsewhere for a good book on this topic."
3,something truely different,"i have mixed yet pleasent feelings about this soundtrack. i personally despised the movie, but i loved the music so i found the soundtrack. now the music on the CD is basically split into african cultural music/ atmospheric music, which i found lightening and even inspirational. the other half of this CD was a sort of hip hop, bounce, rap sort of thing. now while it was good at some parts, the second half just brought the CD dow."
4,And the Oscar goes to . . . .,"""Tsotsi"" is the 2006 Oscar Award winning feature for Best Foreign Film. I got an opportunity to see the film after its re-release at a local independent film venue. The film is an intense depiction of a South African street criminal whose hardened exterior is softened by the power of love. After Tsotsi jacks a car he discovers a baby securely strapped in back. Unsure what to do with the child, Tsotsi takes on the role of provider and in doing so begins to reconcile the trauma of his own childhood. An excellent film and story. Commendable performances by Terry Pheto and Presley Chweneyagae. The soundtrack rocks as well. Highly Recommended!"
5,Zola rocks,The music is generally happy and fun to dance to--a stark contrast to the bleak conditions under which the principals in the movie live in in the townships. The songs by Zola are particularly good. I've listened to it a lot.
3,Mostly disapointing,"I think genius is never more obvious then when average people try and duplicate it and fail. Jack Vance's books are brilliant, full of questionable morals, great dialogue, and more awsome RPG ideas in each book then most authors have in their lives. But this book is a poor attempt at immitating it. Basically it is ridiculous dialogue, without any believability. And the RPG ideas within are more like bits of shiny glass then hidden gems. If you really want some great RPG ideas, read one of Jack Vance's books, not a poor shadow."
3,Custom cover,The ad does not mention that this model is for a Accura Hatchback. It was too short for my car. The material looks good and I wish I could get it for my car model but I saw no details about specifying the car make and model. The AC2010 means t is for an Accura.
4,"good quality cover, fits great","I bought this cover to protect my wife's poor Acura Integra, who doesn't get to sit in a garage. The coverking is well fitted and not difficult to put on. The elastic all around the bottom ensures the cover doesn't get blown around by all the wind we have in the Bay Area. The silver color is nice since it doesn't heat up as well - a plus in sunny California! The Integra exhaust is not covered by the car cover, so i don't have to worry about a hot exhaust melting the cover. The rear-view mirror extensions make it easy to line up the cover before pulling it tight. I especially liked the extra plastic grommet that was included so we could poke a hole for the antenna if needed; on our car the antenna does not always retract properly so this was a nice feature. It appears to be made of a more durable material than most outdoor product covers I've bought before (grills, etc) so I hope it will last a long time. time will tell!"
1,Disapoined,"Buy this product from another vendor, one that represents their products correctly. The product is listed as Cuisenaire Rods Inro Set 74/pk. The pictures show the blocks in a plastic storage box. I ordered it, and received a 56 pack set of rods inside of a large plastic bag that was not resealable. The rods themselves are educational and serve the purpose they were purchased for."
3,too expensive,The creator gives himself credit for the work of others. Something i can do with my mac computer. To lose to learn its not to lose that much.
1,This is a scam,"I ordered three of these combs because they were advertised as ""All Fine Teeth."" They aren't. They are half fine teeth and half not-fine teeth. When I contacted the seller, so-called ""BeatBargains,"" I got the ridiculous excuse that ""other sellers in amazon have and can change the item listing info... Unfortunetly we dont carry the item you specificly want so that puts us in a bad situation."" (Spelling errors replicated as received.) Then they offered me a ""reasonable partial refund. I can do this to show you how sorry we are."" Uh huh. I had to insist on a full refund, which they graciously gave me AFTER I returned the combs."
2,Sure feels cheap,"I haven't been having luck finding fine tooth pocket combs, so I ordered this one. It's like a hard rubber comb; nothing like the stronger plastic ones I've had in the past. Fortunately, I found some Ace combs at my local Vons so I stocked up on some of those. This one's going in the trash."
3,"The editing on this CD is definitely ""rough""","I do like many of the cuts/songs on this CD, although I can't understand why no one edited the sound levels of each cut. Normally, just basic studio editing adjusts each song's volume level so that you don't have to keep adjusting your stereo's volume level from one cut to another....This particular defect on this album is so severe as to make listening to the entire set of music very difficult. Therefore, rating the CD overall is also difficult. Three stars is the best I can give it, although if it had been edited correctly I probably would have rated it 4 or 5 stars."
5,DIRECT TO THE SOUL,"Joan Manuel Serrat has always been more than a singer for me. He is a poet. And this record has something really very special. It is a cd made from the soul to the soul. It does not matter if you can understand Sapnish or not, the music is so beautiful and his performance so tender than you will be trapped in his web.The song Mediterraneo is the most beautiful hymn anyone has ever written to the mare Nostrum. And when you listen Lucia I can assure you, you would think that is one of the most beautiful songs ever written.Enjoy poetry in its purest form, enjoy a singer who feels what he sings."
5,If the soul could speak,"I did not understand poetry until I first heard Serrat's lyrics set to music. This is his obra maestra, a panoply of rich and vivid odes. The title track is an unabashed love letter to the Mediterranean Sea. Brimming with nostalgia, it will elicit a profound longing in anyone who was born or has spent time on its warm shores. You could write a short thesis on each of the songs, most of which are textured by the heaviness of late summer afternoons of decades past.. Serrat is clearly a man in love with life and with the characters who have colored his."
4,EXCELENTE CLASICO,"Indudablemente, Serrat en este disco logra una verdadera obra maestra, con clásicos instantáneos como la canción que le da nombre al album, ""Aquellas Pequeñas Cosas"", ""Pueblo Blanco"", ""Lucía"" y ""Vagabundear"", por nombrar tan solo algunos. Los arreglos orquestales, impecables, están a la altura del disco. Ustedes se preguntarán por qué le he dado cuatro estrellas y no cinco: la respuesta está en la calidad de la grabación técnicamente hablando, que no puede ocultar ni disimular su antiguedad. Pero vaya una aclaración: yo tengo la version original del CD, es probable que en posteriores ediciones haya sido remasterizada, pero eso no lo sé, y el sonido de mi CD es bastante mediocre. De no ser por este detalle, obviamente le daría las cinco estrellas, tal vez en el futuro compre una edición mas moderna de este mismo título en tanto haya sido remasterizada y actualizado su sonido. Altamente recomendable en cuanto al contenido artístico de la obra."
5,MORE SERRAT,"As with the others, I bought the album (yes, a phonograph record!) while studying in Spain 40 years ago, and played it until I no longer had a record player, played the cassette dupe until the cassette player died...."
4,"Wonderful music, a true delight","The opening track ""Lindsey"" and the next to last track ""So Early In The Spring"" are two of the best ""folk songs"" I've ever heard. In between these are some wonderful tunes, and some not so perfect songs (Sidi Brahim being one that I don't much enjoy).Renbourne is a major figure in the world of folk music and he is a very capable guitarist (though not very flashy). His backing band here is very high caliber and the tabla (Indian drum) is a great addition to the group.If you like Altan, Willian Ackerman, and Niel Young (like me), you should give this record a listen. It will be worth your time."
5,Yum,"I found it to be even better when you dump the jar into the blender and liquify it. Lasts longs and tastes that much better. Clings well to ribs, wings and roast pork."
3,Somewhat misleading,"Be aware...the module that contains the light bulb is brass. The ""tail"", the""hat"", and the part that goes against the wall are antique brass finished but made of steel."
3,It worked but not for long,"I got this battery, and charged it. Phone will work for about an hour and then the battery needs to be recharged again. I had hoped that after a few times this would stop, but it has not. Battery works but the phone is always charging. It can't go more than a few hours with out beeping that battery is low. Can hardly walk out of the house and run errons at this rate with the phone. I would say, save the few bucks you would spend on this item and put it towards a new phone or a OEM battery from the actual manufacturer, as this knock off was not worth the shipping charge."
3,Could use improvements,"Once set up it does a fine job and the price is realistic and it is not too heavy. There are plenty of air holes without rendering the panels flimsy. I like that it came with an optional steel reinforced door at no additional cost. I could not find another hard plastic crate for a 30# dog that folded flat for travel. The carrier, however, is difficult to set up - it takes one hand to hold the top up, another one to reach in and grab the panels and another one to provide resistance so the panels snap into place. Collapsing it is similarly cumbersome. Once folded flat it is awkward to carry as the top and bottom panels do not snap into one another - it comes with a flimsy velco strap which, if positioned in the middle, sort of works, but I had to buy two cinch straps. Once folded it can only be carried by it's handle so you are carrying a horizontally flat package, not a vertically flat package - again awkward."
5,Perfect create for our needs,"We own two of these - one for each of our beagles. We think they're great, and have a lot of advantages to other crates.It does take a while to get the collapsing and expanding of the crates down, but when collapsed they REALLY collapse. Whenever we travel with the dogs, we put both beagles in one crate in the back seat of our Civic and the other on the floor of the trunk where it hardly takes up any space at all. I don't think we'd be able to take both crates with us if we'd chosen a different type of crate.The box-like shape of these crates is also something I like. One advantage of this is that we can stack the crates on top of each other, saving us floor space. I don't know if they were really designed for stacking, but we haven't had any problems with them shifting and the dogs don't seem to mind in the least."
1,mislead,"i received this telescope in what appeared to be in pretty condition. little did i know, the eyepiece i was supposed to view the sky with was damaged and i am unable to get repair parts for it. thanks for nothing."
2,The Beginners Guide...,"Karate Warrior is a beginners guide geared more towards a young audience, after all look who wrote it, Austin St. John the former ""Red Ranger"" on the kid TV series Power Rangers. It has sections that tell about the philosophies of martial arts, physical conditioning, mental outlook, etc. There are many color photos on each page that illustrate what is being talked about. It shows how to do a few martial arts moves in the back of the book, which is one of the few good points of the book. 12 year olds and younger might want to read this book, but I don't recommend it to anyone above that age. Like it suggests in the book, if you are really interested in martial arts, try to join one of the many martial arts training groups."
1,Red Danger....,"This book was one of the most uninformative books i've ever read about martial arts. Nothing that special, a lot of what a person can learn from joining a badminton team. It didn't seem very organized at all, you could get more information on martial arts from just surfing the internet. I was very disappointed as i have seen every episode of the first and second season of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.... ughh Jason really let me down this time."
4,Perfect for 3!,"I have owned this stroller for about a year, and we love it! My kids are 5,4, and 1 and this meets our needs perfectly. It is a triple stroller, so expect it to be BIG. However, it handles really well. It is much easier to maneuver than my duoglider double stroller. It it easier when the lightest child rides in the front seat. My only complaint is that it doesn't fit in my mid size suv without putting a third row seat down so use the measurements provided if this is a concern. Overall, its a great product, good quality, and a nice look. I am now addicted to Joovy products and love them all!"
2,Great Stroller for a monster truck,If you own a Tahoe or Suburban the stroller will fit in the back. Own a Jeep Liberty? Forget it! Great idea for a 3 kid stroller just needs to fold down more compactly.
3,Just ok,This stroller was ok for the price compared to other double strollers. We have 4 month old twins and an older child so this was perfect for all 3. This thing is huge. We have a truck and just throw it in the back so fitting isnt a problem but it is heavy to lift. Not to mention it is hard to move when its in the folded position because the wheels will not move and it is heavy and long. Its fairly easy to steer even though it is huge. Its not the stroller to take if your trying to be inconspicous. It does fold and unfold easily.I bought two small cheap strollers and stroller connectors for short trips. That way we can seperate them or push them together. This way we also have something in case it is raining and cant put the big one in the back of the truck.
3,"Good idea, but not functional for me","I have infant twins and a two year old. I love the concept of the stroller... But;(1)not a great deal of room for my two year old with the infant seats on. (2)I have to put my whole body into turns, it also feels like it could tip with two car seats and a two-year old (3)The ""jump seat"" for the two-year old doesn't stay in place, it scoots back, which causes him to lean forward and eventualy I have to stop, and pull the seat back up. It needs a locking mechanism. (4)it absolutely will not fit into a bathroom stall at the mall, so take a friend and take turns watching the kids. I think that without the infant car seats, the whole thing would work better. I returned mine though, I need the infant seats on for a while. I am looking for another solution besides a leash for the two-year old :)"
1,impossible to steer,"I got this for my 2 1/2 year old, 1 year old, and newborn. Just walking down the sidewalk with it was impossible. Every time we crossed someone's driveway, the subtle slope toward the road sent the stroller careening into the street and oncoming traffic. I had to take it down a curb and it almost tipped over. I returned it to the store right away and went back to using my double stroller (a Kolcraft Universal Express, which I love but they don't make any more). I decided it was easier to make my 2 year old walk than to try another triple stroller."
2,Can't use the 3rd sear if you use 2 infant carriers,"I bought this for my newborn twins and 1.5 year old. When the infant carriers are strapped in the 3rd seat (jump seat) does not work. Specifically, the seat closest to the handles leans back too far into the jump seat making it impossible for a child to sit back there. They would slouch forward. The stroller is also huge but i expected that. I wish it worked for us but it just didn't. My friend who also has 3 kids (11 mo twins and a 2 yr old) loves this stroller though. She doesn't use the carriers. I guess if you don't want to use the carriers the stroller might be your best bet. Without using infant carriers, this stroller is not conducive to newborns or small infants. I really need something now so I can get put of the house. I've searched high and low for an affordable, durable stroller for all 3 and I've found nothing. I'm just going to buy a double stroller and a triple wagon."
4,GREAT!,"I'm a mother of 3 boys 3, 2 and 2months and so far love this product. It was easy to put together and well made. Walking to the park is like a ""walk in the park""!"
2,Really hard to turn!,"I have a 3 year old son and 14 month twin girls. This is the only stroller that I could find to meet my needs when I first had the twins. I couldn't use it the first 4 months because the girls couldn't sit up yet. Then, it served my needs fairly well for about 6 months. Now that the girls weigh 25 pounds each and my son is about 29 pounds, I can hardly push the thing. I actually don't take my kids places, because I dread pushing this stroller. I have to put my whole weight into it to make a turn.Now, I'm shopping for a double side-by-side for the girls and will use a harness for my son, who will have to walk..."
4,Hard to turn,I got this stroller to replace a double stroller. I love the ease of folding it and putting it up. It also sets up really quickly. Looks amazing the twins who are 1 and the 2 year old I have all love this stroller. Its a smooth rider. Hard to push up hills and if you are turning on a slope its rough. But it is a triple stroller. Gives you a work out sometimes. Over all I really like it. I wish it did go over small curbs better.
4,stand on triple stroller,"Great stroller, solid, well build, but be warned it is huge and requires a lot of room for storage and transportation. It fits my need."
4,Wish it were shorter somehow,"For having 3 children under 3, we definitely needed this stroller. Easy to maneuver and operate. The only factor we didn't account for was the length of the stroller when folded up. It barely fits in the back of our SUV. Before purchasing, be sure there is enough trunk/storage space to accommodate for length."
5,AWESOME! But Bulky,"I was reading the other reviews and decided to submit a short to the point opinion. This stroller seats my 3 under 3 comfortably, it is light and easy to push. It IS BULKY - but it IS A TRIPLE STROLLER!!Overall I am very happy with it and love the ""strap everyone into a seat concept."" I get a lot more done fast.Very Happy!!Overall, remember that this is a big stroller, it collapses flat but long. It is a triple stroller, so if all you need is a double, or you do not have a large vehicle - do not buy this - If you have three children you would like to have all in one place and you have the room to transport this - Buy it!! we did !!"
4,I LOVE this stroller!!!!,"I have to say that I LOVE this stroller. I have an almost 4 year old, an almost 2 year old and a newborn and they ALL fit in this stroller perfectly. The attachments for the carseat are great. It is easy to pop it on or off. It is a LARGE stroller so you do need to make sure it will fit in the back of your vehicle. I have a Chrysler Town and Country minivan and it barely fits in the back after I take off the attachments which is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. But for me, it is definitely worth the squeeze. And the best thing is that it pushes and turns SO EASY with all three of my kids in it. It is definitely an investment but well worth the price. I could say much more in the praise of this stroller, but I'll stop now! :)"
4,Pure gold...,"If you are a fan of this now legendary duo,I must be preaching to the converted:buy this album-if you didn't do so already-while for those searching for truly good music this is a collector's item.A very strong comeback for Hall&Oates,'Marigold Sky'features some of the best songs they wrote in years:the title track,also 'The Sky is Falling'-arguably one of their best tracks ever...and all the rest.Taste and good musicianship reveal that remarkable talent doesn't easily fade ,moreover both Hall and Oates are equally represented here,leaving no doubt about their magical chemistry.So...hold on to yourself and give it a try!"
3,Very Different Turn,"when i first listened to ""romeo is bleeding"" on ""marigold sky"" i didn't now what to think? the style sounded quite familer but had a updated sound to it.""romeo is bleeding"" is the only ""real"" rocker here, no to say thats bad, it's just not expected, thats all.""promise ain't enough"" and ""the sky is falling"" are both Great, nice soul flow...shows you how god daryl can reall sing.But some songs here sound forced and just made to fill the album up, cause at 70+ minutes this is the first time , for me that i wanted to skip to the next song, for any hall and oates album.Great Adult album, but maybe if they left out 4 or 5 tracks it would of held up better."
4,"Romeo's bleeding, but not milking you","Some reunions work out better than others, but in the 1997 return of Hall and Oates, it worked out very well. Tracks 6 through 12 of MARIGOLD SKY grooves as soulfully as anything I ever heard from Daryl and John. The CD also includes the outstanding title song and the rock and roll ""Romeo Is Bleeding."" Hall and Oates were not back to cash in on name and nostalgia - they had a good record to make! Not surprisingly, they included several MARIGOLD SKY numbers on the '97 tour."
3,GOOD CD,SOME WHAT DISAPOINTED ON THE RETURN OF HALL&OATES IT DOES CONTAIN SOME OF THE MOST POWERFUL SOUFUL CUTS. BUT I FEEL SOME OF THE ROCK TUNES WERE THROW INS. JOHN OATES IS A UNDERATED SINGER. WHO SHOULD BRANCH OUT AS LEAD SINGER ON MORE OF THERE SONGS. HOPEFULLY THE NEXT RELEASE WILL CONTAIN MORE OF THE BALLARD AND UPTEMPO SOULFUL CUTS THAT MADE HALL&OATES SO POPULAR IN THE 80'S
3,Sounds somewhat overloaded,"Howcome I always listen to it a few minutes only ? I then take it out and put in ""Live at the Apollo"", ""H2O"" or any of my older Hall & Oats. It's just not the same quality."
5,A great construct,This book puts together a great series of philisophical ideas. Carrier finally has added the science that we know today and married it to the metaphysics that humans can use for everyday life. I loved this book. I came to many of these conclusions on my own but Carrier ideas tied a lot of athiestic/septical agnostic together for the first time. This book is fresh and more complete than most systems of philosphy I have seen. This is a great leap forward for philosphy of beauty in nature and understanding fo the world. I was overwelmed in how much this book lived up to its title
4,Not as dry as you would think!,"At this time, I haven't yet finished the book, but I'm more than halfway. It's incredible how well what Carrier writes expresses my own feelings in regards to the supernatual and the nature of the world; feelings that I've had for quite a while but was never able to fully articulate.My only issue with the book is that some sections seem unnecessarily preachy (like the section on Love). I mean, I get why that section is there, and what he's doing, and I'm not saying it's inappropriate for the book. I just don't find the sections like this to be as compelling as the others.Excellent book, though, and one I plan to share with my fellow atheists as well as some theists who I think could use a good introduction to metaphysical naturalism."
5,Very good,"This was a relatively easy read for a philosophical paperback. Ideas were very well thought out and well presented in lay terminology. Gives a great case for any atheist, and a good thought-provoker for any deist."
2,Not what it is hyped to be,"When I purchased this, I assumed it was one of the best arguments for a godless philosophy. Instead what I find is a, although structured, very unconvincing book. Not to mention in the few areas that he talks on Buddhism, he just has an assertion with no evidence to back it up. While he does recommend many other books at the end of sections of his book, this seems to be very distracting. And when he talks on politics, it just feels so... I am not to sure how to describe it. An attempt to be comprehensive, but falling VERY short of it even being worth reading. The most interesting part of the book, to me, was his personal story of how he became an atheist. Yet even this felt like it needed some filling in, like something/s had been left out."
3,One of two polar opposites,"I've come to the conclusion that reading books at either end of the polar extremes of metaphysical thought (i.e. either dogmatic theism or dogmatic atheism) are a waste of time. As for the reviewer who states ""Metaphysical Naturalism is full of sense, and encourages nothing but good"",good grief! History clearly shows that good and evil come under all different metaphysical banners."
5,Addictive,"I never played a Tetris-like game before. When I played it @ E3 (Game convention) I was so addicted to it I played until they made me leave (I returned the day after & the day after that). I will definitely preorder this game. In short, the gameplay is similar to Tetris, there are 2 modes: 2D & 3D. 3D mode is much more challenging in that the block structure spins 360 degrees so you have to be really quick. You can choose to be Team Rocket or Ash Ketchum & can choose 1 of 3 Pokemon available for each team. In battling against another player you can devastate him/her by getting combo plays & that will drop a big slab of concrete on their screen. I personally enjoy 3D more."
2,[Pokemon Puzzle League],"I bought the game for my 4 children... ages 5 through 11... boy were we all shocked when we actually played it! It was not much fun for the kids at all!! it is basically one game, Tetris presented a few different ways with different characters decorating the screen... My kids played about an hour and have not touched it since, what a waste. My husband and I played for a bit longer but we too soon lost interest! Don't waste your money, to many other games out there that are better!"
2,CHEAP VERSION OF TETRIS ATTACK,"This game is just like Tetris Attack. It's pretty fun, but why get it when you can get Tetris Attack fsr Super Nintendo or Game Boy far a lot cheaper. If this didn't have the Pokemon Licence, it would draw no attention"
4,"Not only for the young, but only for the young at heart...","I'm 24 and I loved this game. I don't tend to like shooting or racing games; I like the ones with stories, characters, scenery, strategy. Yes, this game is easy, but it really is fun. You drive in a cart (you don't get to control the cart, though; it's like a ride at an amusement park: it just goes) through various environments (beach, river, valley, volcano, etc.) trying to get pictures of different Pokemon. Some are out in the open and easy to shoot, some won't appear without lots of experimentation and/or observation and strategizing. The goal is to get the best shot you can of each different Pokemon. When you get to the end of a level, you pick which pictures you want to show to the Professor for whom you're working. He rates them on different qualities and stores them for his report. You can go back to each level as often as you like trying to get the best pictures. A simple game with fun graphics."
1,dont even look at the box for it might cause blindness,"Don't buy this game , don't play this game and most of all don't look at this game for it might cause blindness OK!!! Trust me people i know what im talking about!!!!"
5,tetris on speed only more competitive,"My roommates in college and I played this every day for a semeseter. Some of our friends bought N64 just for this game. The Pokemon element is annoying and has nothing to do w/ the game and only makes people look at you funny when you try to tell them how cool the game is. Were this Mario's puzzle league it would probably have the name recognition Dr Mario enjoyed. the folks at nintendo botched this one. If you play this long enough you almost enter the matrix so to speak, you can set up huge combos, the head to head 2d mode is my favorite and it's a blast to play w/ your friends. Drinking a little when you play seems to help too. This is like tetris on speed only more competitive b/c the head to head mode also includes strange trash talk from wierd little pokecharacters. dont let the annoying little creatures stop you from checking out this game, its one of the best i've come across."
3,"May be too hard to conquer, but it's worth a rental.",.... it has the exact same difficulty level as the Game Boy version does. (Too hard!) The graphics and sound are the only good parts of this game....
3,Good But Not Great,"This movie had a wonderful theme to it although i feel that the theme was not as strongly portrayed as assumed.Yes, I feel America did a great job in her role and did much better than in her Disney Channel movies but... She could not pull the character as far as she could go because the script seemed limiting. Get the movie but the hype may disapoint you as it did me. Take the movie for what it is and you will certainly enjoy it."
2,I have curves WOO!,"This movie is good because it has a positive message that would make plus-sized women (like myself) have more confidence and self-esteem, but it wasn't that great. There were way too many cheesy and unrealistic moments. I wouldn't say this movie was wonderful, but it wasn't bad."
4,Great inter-play between Ferrera and Ontiveros,"""Real Woman Have Curves"" has the aura of 100% believability. Although the entire cast is excellent, this film centers around the tetchy mother-daughter relationship wonderfully portrayed by astonishing newcomer America Ferrera and consummate professional Lupe Ontiveros. It embodies the pressures facing a second-generation Latina daughter vs. the expectations and disappointments of her hard-edged (but ultimately loving) immigrant mother.For a great take on what made their performances so great, check out Entertainment Weekly's 2002 ""Special Year-End Double Issue"" (the one with Denzel on the cover). The magazine rightly tabbed the Ferrera/Ontiveros duo as one of 2002's ""Great Performances,"" noting that they give us ""the real picture: the everyday growing pains, the cherished moments of tenderness, and the full-out battles that shape the complicated dynamic of this (or any) mother-daughter pair.""Exactly."
3,"Good Message, Mediocre Movie","I had heard great reviews of this so-called cute little flick, so I decided to pick it up at my local used DVD/Bookstore. I was hoping for a story that would inspire me, as a 'plus-size' woman, but in all honesty, it didn't.It was the same old story about a teenager determined to rebel against her family, but this time with a twist - the teenager is fat. This movie explored many different issues - being an overweight individual, being an undervalued minority, the relationships of a family thick with values and old world heritage, growing-up and becoming an adult, and much much more. What the movie didn't do was explore these issues successfully - instead of focusing on one issue or perhaps two, it took a 'jack of all trades' approach, and mastered nor conquered any issues at all.The acting is less than stellar, the dialogue is cliche, and the movie is very predictable. I was disappointed with this movie and urge others not to waste their time."
4,"Lessons in courage, self-esteem, and following your heart","This is a wonderful movie which brings back memories of similar trials I went through 35 years ago...except in my case the battle was with my father who felt there was no need for Latin women to go to college since they will only get married and have children. America, as Ana, did a great job in demonstrating the conflict one goes through when trying to decide whether to ""honor your parents"" or go for that gold ring -- a decision which ultimately is dictated by the level of your courage,self-esteem and a ""little help"" from your friends."
4,America Ferrera is great!,I enjoyed watching this movie. America Ferrera ruled the screened. Her presence made the movie so real. I was blown away by the culture of this Mexican family. All of us have family & cultural traditions that are hard to get away from. Ana seemed to know who she is at a very early age. I loved her character and I look forward to seeing this young lady in other films.
4,A make-you-feel good movie,"A good movie with a simple plot, yet with a powerful message. Not your normal Hollywood movie. A very pleasant surprise."
3,Great movie......,"This movie portrays the life a young, Latin-American female trying to cope with pressure of being the adhering to her mother's wishes and being herself. Ana (Ferrera) is a teenager in from southern California trying to go to college. However, her mother Carmen (Lupe Ontiveros) wishes for her to lose weight and get married like the typical Spanish girl of her age.I think the movie hit on a lot of stereotypes toward Spanish-American females really well. It also showed that it is possible for someone to break these stereotypes and find themselves as their own human being. This is a must see movie."
4,very nice,"I liked this film because it was refreshing. You've got this girl named Ana who has issues with her weight, going to college, her mother, working for her sister, getting her first boyfriend and a few other things. I like how determined she was to be somebody. She just didn't stop and take whatever was handed to her. This film made me feel better as a person (especially about my weight). I also like how comfortable the actress America Ferrera (who played ana) was with herself in this film. That type of boldness is needed with this generation now a days. Why this movie was seen as a comedy is beyond me. It's more of a drama. Overall this film is a must see."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Cheap price, cheap scope. Would probably be ok for a pellet gun or standard 22 rifle.Would not recommend this scope."
5,Great for my .22,I put this on my glenfield model 25 bolt action .22 and it works great. Makes the little .22 look like a sniper gun. Holds zero well.
1,Unreliable Scope,"I believe that anyone writing a positive review about this scope ran out and bought it and wrote their review after shooting it once. I went through 3 of these in 2 months attached to my .22. I handled my gun with care, and the scope was never dropped. With the first two, the crosshair became completely detached and began to spin freely within a few weeks. The crosshair on my most recent replacement also shifted slightly, but I was too lazy to return it once again since i still beleived it was accurate on my .22. I recently switched it over to my .308, and can honestly say it is nowhere near being accurate. With any other scope my .308 shoots perfectly straight, but with this scope every shot ends up somewhere different than the last. I would not recommend this scope to anyone."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in this book. I had expected much, much better construction description after reading Taylor's book on building a Lute. These construction descriptions are absolute minimal. Most casual builders will have a lot of trouble building most of these instruments. I build harps professionally and it would not be easy. With just a little more effort this could have been a great book on building a variety of instruments but I think the writing was done in a minimum amount of time.The Gothic Harp, in which I was most interested, didn't have any info on stringing, the critical part of a harp. Oh, don't expect any info on the harp on the cover, it's not in the book. So why is it on the cover?As I said, his other book, Make and Play a Lute, is very detailed and has all the info needed. Why this wasn't done here is puzzling,and disappointing."
4,A historical look at Georgia's Coast.,"Lure_and_Lore is a book of interesting historical people, events, and places on Georgia's ""Golden Isles"". The 15 barrier islands of Georgia are enchanting enough, but the stories here give insight to some of the forgotten history behind them. One low point though; Jekyll and St. Simons Islands are well represented while Cumberland Island has few mentions."
3,"""Best by"" date 11 months away.",The indicated shelf life seems much too short for a dry product. Either the product is particularly sensitive or I got old stock in my shipment.
5,Delicious !,This is a great product if you don't eat meat.It is easily made with water and tastes great ! The taco flavoring is yummy.
5,Delicious,So easy to prepare and delicious. Quick easy way to make tacos and I don't think anyone would know it isn't real beef.
4,"Great, easy meat alternative","I love this stuff because it tastes great, does not require refridgeration and takes only minutes to make."
4,Great product - questionable price,"This makes a quick easy and delicious vegan meal when we serve it on blue corn taco shells with fresh avocado, sliced grape tomatoes, etc. However the price here on Amazon comes out to $3.96 a box and I can buy them individually at my local Kroger - King Soopers in Denver for $2.79 a box."
4,"Very good, a little salty on its own...","As I was cooking this for the first time, I took a taste to check for seasoning and thought it was a little on the salty side. Once I added the usual toppings to my taco it was excellent. Very close to ground beef tacos in taste and texture."
5,Very good!,"I find it kind of funny how some people found this too salty. I had to add more salt because to be it wasn't salty enough! I made some nachos with this and they turned out great. Most likely someone who didn't know this wasn't real meat wouldn't be able to tell the difference. I made some enhancements for my tastes, by adding some extra salt, garlic powder, onion bits, and substituting some of the oil it calls for with sharp cheddar, which melts right into at and gives it a little tang and richness. I bought 3 of these on special at the local grocery store, hoping I wasn't making a mistake, and I'm happy I made the purchase."
3,"Edible, but not what I like really...","The flavor to me seems like just chili powder. It's just a matter of preference as to what you like. I've been mixing salsa in it to add some veggie flavors and textures, and for me it's an improvement..."
1,"THIS SHOULD BE CALLED ""JUNK""",Worse program I ever tried using. Kept giving me errors and freezing. Save your money and go for the other panorama software(s) out there! THIS ONE IS JUNK!
1,Save Your Money,"If you were hoping to gain some knowledge of cabinet making suitable for amateurs, you've come to the wrong place. If you are hoping for some guidance that is less than 100 years old and drawings/pictures that are readable try anything by Danny Proulx, because you won't find it in this book. I guess I should have looked beyond the title.This book is a collection of very small print articles from the early 1900's. Perhaps they are in public domain now and were ""collected"" by the editor. The drawings resemble the quality one might find in a paperback version of Gray's anatomy."
4,Well Written & Produced.,"I saw this out in theatres and thought it was quite amazing. I'd have to say very well written and produced. This makes you go through all the emotions--anger, happiness, sadness & more.**A lot of people were crying in the movie theatres--it seems to touch a lot of ""boat"" people."
4,FS,This is a great product.It is not easily available in the supermarket and I was so glad Amazon had this.This Thai Red Curry spice has an excellent flavor and is very easy to make.You should try this if you are a Thai food fan!!!
1,Only Styli-Style product not up to pare :/,"I bought this a long time ago ... very small, soft, smeary little messything.Didn't last, but did embed it's self into every crease and for some reasonwas impossible to remove :/I found their eye brow pencil worked beautifully for the desired look :]"
4,great product,"I love kajal, however it is challenging to find the authentic one, this one worked just fine!"
2,"Dark, but smudgy","I was looking for a good, thick, kohl/Kajal product. At first I thought this was it, but despite its decent color, it smears VERY easy. So unless you are careful, I would only recommend this is a near last resort. Not to mention you aren't really getting a whole lot of eyeliner."
4,"Good, not perfect","This product was priced well and shipped promptly. It's good, but doesn't quite measure up to the ""old"" Indian eyes that I'm used to. I'm glad I tried it and it does not irritate my eyes at all, but I'm accustomed to a darker black on the inner eyelid. It is also rather small in comparison to others I've had and it feels a little dry upon application, therefore takes a few attempts at application. But it does not smear or run, which is definitely a plus. I like it well enough and will use it every day. Pretty good product."
3,Small and Convenient,It is small and convenient not messy. It is more line a eye liner than a thick indian kajal
2,Brain dead,"If you believe that the West, and in particular the United States, is responsible for all the sickness and poverty in the world this movie is for you. It starts out as a sweet May-December romance but mid-way through turns into a whiny diatribe. At a G8 summit in Reykjavik the ""heroine"" attacks the Western leaders at a formal dinner for not giving more money to the world's developing countries. She doesn't really seem to want workable solutions to the problems of disease and poverty; she just wants more money be thrown at them. And it's strange that this wonderful, caring, considerate woman doesn't seem to give a second thought to the fact that she is ruining the career of the man she claims to care for by issuing her rant to his bosses. People with a simplistic approach to solving the world's problems will love this movie. People with a brain won't."
3,"oh man,what a poor ending,but his acting a 5","Two words:Bill Nighy !I was hooked on this guy the minute he opened his mouth.Where have I been,(as much as I love movies and character actors)that I have never heard of this guy?I am crazy for him.The scenery was gorgeous,why not more???And why on earth did the movie disolve into a commercial????Hey,you could have done that on a separate disc.I was sick to see the movie end on such an uneven note..Yikes,I feel like I just got dumped..I almost want to watch it again,just to see him again,(and them still together)..sighFrankly,I didn't care so much for the young gal.But she was so over matched with his acting..it dwarfed her.Oh my gosh,I am going to find out where I can see him again."
2,Crude propaganda: captivating in the beginning but in the end you feel cheated of two hours,"If you like to be taught by crude propaganda, you might like this. I love the actor Nighy, but this piece of writing is really trashy in its simplicity. The romantic comedy part of this film is basically there just to draw you into the picture. Then the propaganda begins. The propaganda is for a good cause, but it is so crudely crafted so it makes you cringe. And of course being a British production, it is the Brits that are the good guys. Fine, but so simplistic.If you are a left-leaning anti-establishment person you will probably like this film. Personally, the key problem I have with the film is the crudeness of the propaganda. I still give it two stars because Nighy's performance is great and I was really pulled into the film, before I felt cheated"
4,Not just another chick flick,"The underlying subject of this movie supports a seemingly slow pace, matching well with the dry British humor and the spartan setting of Iceland. For those of us who know Bill Nighy only as Victor, it's quite surprising. Kelly Macdonald is at least borrowing from her role in Entropy, but the acting throughout is superb. The story is never quite finished, and shouldn't be -- and the movie is almost profound."
3,The Girl in the Cafe,"Bill Nighy is a British Civil servant who meets a cute girl played by Kelly MacDonald. Nighy is on his way to the G-8 Summit, and he decides to take Kelly's character Gina along as a traveling companion. Now you have to suspend your disbelief. It is no harder than believing you see a thousand ships in front of the walls of Troy. What follows is a tender love story leavened with a spoonful of social change commentary. The young woman is admitted to the dinners at the Summit with the Civil Servant who is there to help negotiate a treaty on poverty. The agenda is much like the Summit of G-8 in Gleneagles, Scotland, July 2005. The story ends with a surprise. It is all a little sappy, but the story is played well by a really good cast. MacDonald is a treasure, and Nighy is a real pro. See it. Enjoy it."
2,Dangerous Poison,"There could have been a great theme here about an outsider shaking up powerful men, but it's buried in the insufferably naive, pompous, and pretentious idea of 8 leaders eliminating all poverty. Tyrants, armed tribes, and dictators are the reason most children die. I wonder how many of the ""do gooders"" that applaud or cry at this nonsense will ever write a check toward drilling a well or financing a medical trip."
2,Propagandist fairy tale,"The other reviewers have already captured my experience of this film. I really enjoyed the lead actors, but the film, itself was such a disappointment. It is really nothing more than cheap political propaganda. I felt I'd been used."
1,Not A Romantic Comedy,"The premise for this film is HIGHLY improbable. C'mon. Not only is the story line improbable but it is just one long piece of propaganda. Don't be fooled, it's not romantic. It's not a comedy. Also, I wonder: How can an entire creative group such as the writer/producer/director/actors make such a horrible film? I mean, really, how do they rationalize doing this kind of schlock? One of the worst ""films"" I've ever seen. And... I'm not done... the tempo of the film was painfully S-L-O-W, the dialogue unbelievably D-U-L-L. Bleh, bleh, bleh. Hated this film. Okay. I'm through ranting. Sorry for all the negativity."
4,Delightful little film waiting to be discovered,"This film is beautifully-acted and -filmed, and it will make you laugh and cry, and think and care. It tells the story of anyone can make a difference. Bill Nighy (Love Actually, I Capture a Castle, Underworld) and Kelly Macdonald are absolutely wonderful in it. The writing is superb superb! Richard Curtis, please write a sequel so that we find out what happens to the main characters. The music is good too - ""Cold Water"" by Damien Rice sets the tone at the start of the film."
4,"A good theme, but not very subtle","This is a good movie and the acting is excellent. However the story line is a little preposterous and I feel that the story line could have been more realistic to the overall benefit of the movie. However, I do recommend this movie."
5,the girl in the cafe,the girl in the cafe is a wonderful film on so many layers. as a film about a relationship between an older man and a younger girl it works very well but the text tells it all. and the further it develops the further all the layers are opened up. it is not until the last scenes is the full story revealed. so as not to spoil it for others this is a film that is well worth many viewings as with each viewing more is understood about the film and the characters.
4,Thought Provoking,"I really enjoyed this movie. There were so many undertones about the movie that made it great. The music was one of those tones. Does anyone know who sings the opening duet? That song masterfully created a scene of loneliness and yet hope that at any point you may meet someone who will change everything--you gain courage, you gain love, and you re-gain hope that the world can be changed and can be different"
5,Good Film,"Enjoyed the film. Enjoyed the soundtrack almost as much. When, oh when, will it be released?"
2,"If you LOVED ""Love Actually""...","then you probably won't be impressed by this film. Sure, Bill Nighy is fab, as usual, as is Kelly MacDonald, but it's pretty hard to swallow their random relationship. It's also hard to believe that she could so easily infiltrate the G8 Summit. There are several sweet moments, but they're just as implausible.SEMI-SPOILER:Why exactly does she kiss him when she does? I don't buy it.I'm a fan of movies with a point, but it just doesn't work. Sorry, folks."
5,Quirky; and we love Nighy,"It's not your everyday love story. Nor your every day social commentary. But the story's combination of both, and done well, and our appreciation for Bill Nighy made this a must see...and then a must buy. Kelly MacDonald was very convincing as was the non-sappy, very attractive relationship that was developed."
5,Excellent film!,Saw it on HBO just flipping through the channels.. for anyone that is fond of unconventional love movies this should definitely be a must see. Excellent performances by everyone. Enjoy!
3,Need improve,The wall-10 level solid wood belt display the paint was scratch and missing the red color. a piece of wood was loose
2,"Mediocre, at best","I love and collect soul food cookbooks, as well as church community cookbooks. However, what I most love about them is the warmth of why the people and recipes are so special. I COULDN'T FIND ONE SUCH WORD HERE! There is much more warmth and personality in a Betty Crocker book. I strongly recommend that you seek out cookbooks by Norma Jean and Carole Darden, Sylvia Woods, Joyce White, Patti LaBelle, and other wonderful soul food authors who take the time to tell you WHY each of their recipes are so special. The Harlem Abyssisian Baptist Church cookbook also does this ... only this one is sterile and lacking, so I definitely can't recommend it. What a waste!"
5,WOW! So Surprised!,"I've never been more pleased! This collection of church recipes is HUGE! The cookbook itself is larger than 8.5x11, and the recipes are the ""tried and true"" kind that are getting harder to locate in this day and age. If you're looking for great recipes look no further...this is the cookbook for you...and the best part is the price!"
5,Nice Big Book,Got this book today and what a nice cookbook quite a large book. Lots of good recipes can't wait to get started. My sister looked at it to she said what a NICE book I may order her one.No pictures of the food you are making but easy recipes most wouldn't need a picture.Personally I like pictures but this one is great even without them. Nice little writings mixed with recipes makes it nice to read too.
5,"Heartfelt, beautiful","This is one of the prettiest folk records ever made. Heartfelt and beautiful. Their versions of ""One Little Word"" and ""Are You Tired of Me My Darling?"" are particularly sweet. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Hick Music)"
2,A disappointing read,"I was disappointed in this book. Not alone were there aspects of the plot that I found quite weak, but it badly needed an Irish editor. The book is filled with errors in spelling, speech patterns etc."
3,So-So,"Swimsuit was a good fit.... not supportive for bigger bust and absolutely no butt support. stomach was tight but fabric around rear sagged. I know women differ in body much, but this suit didn't fit well for my shape. The fabric is thick and I was impressed by that. :)"
4,Good blocks,"These are really fun for toddlers to shake and experiment with sounds. They also look really nice as part of a block tower mixed with other types of blocks.I have two minor complaints/observations:1. The name ""crystal"" implies that the beads will be translucent and have some sparkle to them. While the beads are ""crystal cut"", they are actually opaque and do not have any shine at all. It seems that they missed a chance for added visual appeal and were a bit misleading in the name.2. The clear acrylic that encloses the beads seems to be scratched on the inside from the beads. As a result, the window part is cloudy and has small impressions of beads on the inside. On close inspection, this is pretty significant. When the blocks are part of a tower or building, it is not so noticeable.With just those couple of minor reservations, I would absolutely recommend these blocks."
2,Misleading,"The product works OK, just don't expect your invoices to look like the ones on the box. That requires you purchase pre-printed forms ($50-$60 for 250 forms).Printing (HP Deskjet 862C) on blank paper the invoices look so lame you could have done better with a spreadsheet. Shaded areas print out as big dots even when set to print greyscale or color. Prints black and white only. Except I did get a color logo to print. Did not print JPG or GIF, but did it it to work with pict format. Functionality is good, but don't expect to print ""Professonal Invoices"" out of the box without spending more money for forms."
3,Basic info,Basic info that answered most of my questions about the Paleo diet. Layout of cooking/recipe sections are difficult to maneuver through. I would have liked to have seen pictures of the finished dish.
5,best diet ever,i am a firm believer in the paleo diet! i am a personal trainer and a business owner as well and i stand behinde this product
4,Paleo diet,Book was purchased for info on said diet and to follow diet with a crossfit training regiment seems to work well hand in hand
4,good book,"I really enjoyed this. The information makes sense to me - not just my brain, but my physical intuition resonates with this way of eating. I was so grateful when it came out because I had suspected, in recent years, that our genetic history should dictate our diet. I do think we should have more detailed background on what our specific ancestors ate.For instance, I have a native American friend who, through process of elimination & re-introduction has discovered she can eat beans and corn with no problems whereas I cannot. Her ancestors have had enough time to adapt to a diet including them. I suspect the grain barley would be OK for me because it was eaten for thousands of years by my Celtic ancestors. Orientals probably have foods they are genetically predisposed to deal with just fine.But this is a really good start on what I hope will become a more detailed subject for some researcher in the future."
4,Good Start,This book explains the reasons for the Paleo diet and what it is. This establishes a very good basis for anyone. I used it as a starting point and then got the Paleo Diet for Athletes to refine my diet for competition and athletic endeavors.
3,Outdated,I was disappointed to find that this was an older work of Dr. Cordain's. His messages through his website and podcast interviews contradict some of what is in this book. I hadn't realized that he had a new book coming out...bummer!
5,Excellent way to eat...,"I am very successful with this eating plan. I do not miss salt, dairy or breads. Love all the fruits and vegetables. Give it a try. You will be much healthier with more energy."
3,A god nutrition reference but...,"...I wish there were more scientific in-depth discussion to the claims of the book. There's a lot of persuasive talk (and I believe that's how the diet books are written) but unlike some other diet books this one has an incredible and consistent message: The humans evolved to eat a certain diet; what we eat presently is contrary to our genes, thus all the ""diseases of affluence""; thus, you eat what you ancestors ate.Unfortunately, this is a standard diet book, and I wish the authors explore more and debunk the criticism of the Paleo Diet (for example, the role of abundance of calories and role of exercise), the book would be more credible. I would give it 3 1/2 starts, since the overall message of the book can take on a dozen of diet books put together.By all means be familiar with this diet."
2,nauseating,"It sounded so plausible. But I couldn't hack this diet, I quickly started to feel nauseous. My diabetes dietician wasn't impressed either."
2,looks to me,"Looks to me like Mr. Cordain should go on a diet of some kind, or get to doing a daily Paleo-workout.Guy looks like one of those flabby, over-weight exercise gurus on TV--or maybe a venal evangelist from the old-South.How can you be seduced by people like this?tlt-"
3,"Agree that lean meat, seafood, fruit & vegetables are healthy, however...","I am a certified weight consultant & the author ofAsian Slim Secrets. I can agree with the author that lean meat, seafood, fruit & vegetables are healthy. However, I do not agree that one should get rid of cereals and legumes from their diet. It is not consistent with the food pyramid. Unprocessed cereals and legumes contain a lot of fiber and resistant starch which are beneficial for weight loss."
4,"Good information, easy to read.","So I haven't started to fully jump into this eating style, but I think I will give it a shot. Loren Cordain Ph.D makes a great case as to what diet us in modern time should be eating - the diet our Paleo ancestors ate.Lean meats, Vegetables, Fruit & nuts.This has to be one of the easiest diets I have ever come across...oh and delicious.The author makes it easy to understand, gives you great case studies and backs it up with a huge bibliography of knowledge.What I loved about it was the menu's that you could use and the charts of food information. You can even discover how alkaline raisins are.Overall I think this way of eating could be really beneficial to me. The symptoms of a bad diet that the author goes over are exactly what I have been experiencing lately in my life.So I will recommend this diet when it starts to work fore me, but I will recommend this book right away. Great information and easy to read."
4,not bad,"although anyone who knows me can tell you that i love paleo, the way this book was written leaves a lot left to be desired."
4,Paleo Diet,An interesting and detailed description of what is a healthy way to lose excess poundage. I recommend it for those who have tried other diets.
3,Worth Reading but..,This book has been an interesting read. IF they didn't ramble on about evolution I'd recommend it. Another epic fail is that they put diet soda on the OK list but yams are a no no Seriously?
3,"Great author, so so book","I found this book a little light on science given the credentials of its author. Having read some of Cordain's journal papers I know every word he's saying in the book is backed up by research, but I would have loved to see the connections made more clear. I'm sure this was a conscious decision on his part, but for me, the book came off a little too generalistic. While the recipes themselves are good, I thought a plan on how to use them was missing, as in a meal plan. Robb Wolf did a better job of this in his recent book, giving a 30-day mealplan and shopping list available on his website."
4,Mostly Right,"The book is a great overview of the human body's natural diet. Dr. Cordain does a great job explaining in detail the concepts of a Paleolithic Diet and how it translates into modern day eating. I agreed with most of Dr. Cordain's concepts except when it came to eating fat. Fat, and more specifically saturated fat, has been unfairly villainized by modern paradigms and this book does nothing to clear this misinformation. There is some evidence to suggest that our ancestors preferentially ate the fat from the animals they hunted. Cordain's diet seems to skirt this issue and combine a true paleo diet with a modern day, politically correct, low fat diet."
1,30 year lifespan?,"Honestly! Yeah, you too can live a whopping THIRTY YEARS if you turn your body into a graveyard by eating dead animals. LOL. Come on! People today are like little kids who just refuse to eat their vegetables and wanna dream up all kinds of excuses not to. Just go vegan and be done with it. Eat veggies and not fake meats and cheeses. Then you most likely will live to be a fit, trim, healthy ONE HUNDRED! Now doesn't that seem like a better deal?"
1,"So, where did the Paleolithic get their flaxseed oil from?","This one little detail completely invalidates this specific book. I believe in the paleolithic diet as being extremely healthy, BUT the recommendation on fats is just bizarre, if one is buying the premise of paleolithic man's diet as being the most healthy and therefore the one we should follow. Where did the Paleolithic farm their flax? Where did they extract the oil from? Where were their orchards of olive trees?Additionally, there is the little detail that heating flaxseed oil is a big no-no, something I thought everyone knew. Oops."
2,The Paleo Diet book,Good book but wish it had more recipies; not a book i'm probably going to sit and read cover to cover
3,Need a diet!,"My son is on this diet, so I wanted to know what he can have when he comes over for dinner."
5,&#65332;&#65352;&#65349;&#12288;&#65328;&#65345;&#65356;&#65349;&#65359;&#12288;&#65316;&#65353;&#65349;&#65364;,This book gives me very helpful information of everyday food for even ones like me who is a Japanese. We live generally on rice and fish with imported food frommany foreign countries.Read it and get healthier life.
3,Great for those beginning the paleo diet or consider it but not great for those already invested,"I thought this book had some good points and was a nice read but I would not recommend it as great reading. The book was not life changing nor was it extrememly motivating. The book promoted eating healthy, lean meats, limiting fats and sugar, and eating a great deal of fruits and vegetables. I felt like this information is pretty standard rule for most people interested in the Paleo lifestyle. I didn't feel like there was a great deal of information on how to plan meals for the day to day- more just an overview of what can and cannot be eaten based on their individual take of the paleo diet. Too clinical- I was looking for something more personal and motivational.As someone who has been living the Paleo Lifestyle for a while I was looking for a more indepth look into the diet."
3,Recommended book,"This book was pretty good. The paleo diet has been helpful, although I needed some modifications. The book is well-written overall, but I would have appreciated more data to back up the claims."
3,The Book that Started it all,"The book that really kick-started the paleo movement. By reading this book it really opened my mind and I started reading the other Paleo works. I think Loren's book is a little flawed and you'd probably be better off reading ""The Paleo Solution"" by Robb Wolf. His book is definitely reader friendly. HIs podcast on iTunes is pretty hilarious as well."
4,A little misinformed,"Overall, a pretty good diet book which is easy to read and understand and follow.However, in the book Dr. Cordain claims that milk/dairy is bad for you. He claims that our Paleolithic ancestors did not drink milk, which is probably true, but what he fails to mention is that the European and Near Eastern Caucasian people underwent a natural selection process that enabled them to digest milk. Meaning, that ancient individuals that couldn't digest milk died off, and the ones that could digest milk thrived and reproduced, and thus furthered their genetic makeup of adult milk consumption. So obviously, mother nature thought it best to consume dairy products.No, I refuse to give up dairy products. Milk, yogurt, ice cream, creamer for coffee is what I live for. I hate chalky tasting soy."
2,Nothing revolutionary,"While this book was correct most of the time, and suggests a diet that would likely be effective, it doesn't really have any novel information, or even present the information in any terribly new way. If you do your reading, you will find this information from a million other sources."
2,"If you have lots of money, then you can follow the diet",I purchased this book thinking that I would really enjoy having a different approach to low carbs. This book advises you to purchase high dollar foods. I was not impressed with it.
2,Not the plan for me,"While I need to be gluten and this diet provides that I didn't feel that it met my overall needs, I felt tired after long runs and had problems recovering."
3,Too hard to find certain foods.,"I'm sticking to this but loosely. It's hard to find most of the meats recommended, so I'm just using the ones in the supermarket. It's not exact, but it's working."
5,Forget industrialized food - Paleo eating is what humans were meant to do!,"This is the most common sense book on dieting available. Humans have survived for millions of years without the industrialized / modern diet. The Paleo diet explains why humans should not eat grain-based products, food additives, preservatives, and genetically modified foods. The modern diet is what is making us sick and killing us.Well written and explained at a scientific level. A must read for anyone looking to clean up their diet and their life and find optimal health and wellness."
4,Great book but only a starting point on Paleo,This book is fantastic. All the information and recipes are great but it is only a starting point when learning about the paleo style nutrition. There are lots of resources that are out there like [...] and [...] as well as Dr. Cordain's blog. I encourage you to keep doing some research after this book.
5,So far so good!,"I have been on the diet 3 weeks and I feel great. I have also lost 10lbs. This is a great guide for starting the Paleo Diet. If you can make it through the first 48 hours of carb withdrawl, it will work. I also recommend ""Neanderthin"". But this book really does a great job of explaining the entire process and the theory behind it. It makes the plan simple with a food guide. Do it!"
3,Aquatic Ape,"While the author mentions Omega-3 and Ocean food he completely ignores the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis which is the basic source for the argument on Omega-3 and ocean food, and bases his book on the Hunter Gatherer Hypothesis.He also attacks the use of salt, sodium chloride. According to the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis our ancestors spent millions of years in a semi-aquatic environment, which means that they spent a significant amount of time in ocean motor, which is loaded with many salts and minerals, including sodium chloride.Miguel Melgar"
4,Im a caveman,"Enjoyed the book very much I started the diet 3 weeks ago and I am down 15lbs already.I do miss bread sometimes,but I'll never go back to the way I used to eat also I have alot more energy and less fog when concentrating good read"
5,"Great way to eat, been generally following it for 3 years, have lost weight, and improved my blood chemistry and pressure.","Great way to eat, been generally following it for 3 years, have lost weight, and improved my blood chemistry and pressure. Initially lost 20 lbs. now have started weightlifting again, thus have put 6 lbs of muscle back on. I am lean and cut, on not meds and I'm 50 years old. Processed carbs = suger, don't eat them. Very, very, VERY simple ""diet"" to follow. Eat lean meat and fish, freash fruit and vigies. Don't eat much of anything else. What u eat maters as much as the quantity. U can eat well, and not be hungry, IF u eat the right foods."
3,The Paleo Diet,Concept excellent....Restrictive if followed exactly but modified to your lifestyle following the basics is very doable.
5,wow! abundant information. i lost 5 lbs in 3 days!,"what a great book, the paleo diet has a lot of valuable information. overall the book is worth its price. this book is NOT A DIET! ITS A LIFE CHANGE, and it requires a lot of discipline to avoid the foods you once ate (pizza for me)."
2,Use Your Common Sense,"I believe a healthy diet is critical for a long healthy and happy life. However, I do not believe comparison to the caveman diet who had a life expectancy of <30 years is very credible. Cholestrol is not taken into consideration in this diet but should be. I think I'll write a diet/lifestyle book. ""If it comes in a box or package, has food coloring, chemicals or additives or you can drive through driveway to buy your meal, don't eat it's because it's toxic. In addition to that, limit or eliminate eating anything that has a face. Also remember, starch or carbohydrate is just a different name for sugar."
2,Interesting but not very healthy,"This book is interesting in that it looks at the diet of ancient civilizations but I would not recommend it for a modern diet, it does not seem to be nutritionally balanced. I would highly recommend that you discuss this type of diet with your doctor before you jump into it as it seems to emphasize a lot of protein which can be hard on the kidneys. Ancient man might have been designed to eat the type of foods recommended in this diet but modern man does not face the same kind of environment or challenges that ancient man was faced with on a daily basis. There are much better nutritionally balanced diets out there that take into account all the medical & nutritional research that has taken place over the past several years.Read this book as a historical look at foods & diets in ancient times but do not take it too much to heart for a weight loss plan for today."
2,Too much fluff,This book gave a lot of background information about how we ate in the past and why people were much healthier. It was repeated over & over again. I knew which diet I wanted to go on just wanted tips to make the transition easier. I was looking for recipes and maybe a monthly meal plan and a food shopping list. It would have made things easier for me.
5,It's like the college education you were supposed to get.,"Just as the quote on the cover says, ""you can do no better for building your English vocabulary,"" short of learning Greek, Latin, French and German, than to read this book.Each odd page has a clump of words on on it, the words of which you can tell have something in common in meaning, because they share a common root. You guess what the words have in common, and turn the page over to see how each word relates to the common root. It's the ultimate answer-book for the questions you've had in your head since high school.Plus, when you are tired of guessing, you can get engrossed in the fact-filled rest of each odd page, sectioned into ""wordextras"" and ""wordbuilders.""It would definitely be one of the 3 books I'd take with me to a deserted island, should I know I was going."
3,"Good for progressive folks, but not for newcomer",This album is a nice compilation of some classic folk and social justice music. But it's not the best album for a newcomer to such music...several songs too slow without enough powerful voices.
5,Good ice,They worked great. My advice is to buy twice what you think you'll need and buy a variety of sizes and shapes.
4,Es un gran libro para la enseñanza de Met. Num.,"Contiene importantes aplicaciones de los M.N a la Ingeniería Química en especial, analiza cuidadosamente los principales métodos, así como su potencia, error, aplicación, etc. constituye una herramienta muy útil para la enseñanza de esta materia. Personalmente lo uso para preprararme a ingresar a un programa de maestría en Ingeniería Química."
3,Good Deal for the Money,The sky's the limit price wise for spotting scopes but this scope is very reasonably priced.I use this one for zeroing in my rifles at 100yds and it works great for me. It even comes with its own case. The only real drawback is a flimsy tripod. Don't leave it standing on tripod next to you on tripod unless you're firing a small caliber rifle.
4,Great scope for the money,I had been looking for a replacement scope to replace an over 50 year old one that finally failed on my pistol box. This is a great value and will do the job nicely up out to 100 yds. To give you an idea of it's ability at 25 yds I was easily able to read my neighbor's registration tag numbers (very small) on their license plate tag.As has been mentioned the included tripod is kind of chintzy (hence 4 vs. 5 stars) so I did include a better one that fits as well into the included hard case and is very sturdy. The original tripod can used with most cameras as a bonus. Would buy again.
1,What watch?,"I would love to review this item, but I never received it! It was ordered late for a Christmas gift, but the page promised expedited delivery and it would arrive on Christmas Eve. Guess what? There was an I.O.U under the tree. I would also like to say that it arrived the day after Christmas, but after finally getting hold of someone at Customer Service, I was given the number to fossil because Amazon Customer Service could do nothing for me! Fossil told me the watch had shipped. 2 days later I had to call Fossil again and they tell me I won't get it at all because it was out of stock. It was still showing as available on Amazon.com. So, Fossil told me to call them! I did. They told me they would call Fossil. Then I get this review, and all I got for Christmas was a headache! Never again will I order Fossil from Amazon.com! By the way, it is still showing as available, and if you call Fossil they say they will never have anymore of these, so don't waste your time!"
3,Pretty Good Little Mystery,"This was a good story about a small town church. I enjoyed the cast of characters, some suspense, and a nice ending. The lengthy descriptions of the workings of a pipe organ, not so much. The pencil sketches interspersed through-out the book was a nice touch."
4,Fascinating and intriguing mystery,This book was intriguing and anyone that has been involved with sacred music will find it extremely interesting. Great assortment of characters and plot was wonderful.
4,Divine Inspiration from a Minister,"As a Unitarian Universalist minister, I always enjoy Jane Langton's Homer Kelly mysteries which always seem related to Unitarian churches or characters (Emily Dickenson, Thomas Jefferson), or to the center of Unitarianism-Boston and Harvard. I love (and miss) the Boston area; she captures the flavor, and it seems, even the accent and nuance of the area. This one kept me guessing right until the end, with interesting twists and turns. I especially like the way the church and music culture is interwoven into the story without it being crucial to believe one way or another. The fact that I'm a liberal thinker like the minister in the story obviously helps! You don't have to be a Unitarian to enjoy her mysteries, but I think Unitarians would enjoy them even more. They are good mysteries and Homer Kelly seems to personify the old New England calm and gentle wisdom of the professor, detective, policeman, husband, not James Bond or some flashy or violent hero. Good stuff."
1,a long list,"That's about all this books is, a very long list of adult titles and perfromers, a filmography, if you will. Not much detail or background provided on any of the films or performers. It's rather dry and hard to get through, despite it being fairly light.But the big kicker was several statements I found that were obviously wrong, just general knowledge things-not even specifically related to adult film. It seems that this publisher doesn't employ a fact-checker or a proofreader. Additionally, the author is British and apparantly doesn't have a very good grasp on American law as it applies to obscenity and adult films.Finally, although the book is entitled ""an illustrated history of adult cinema"" the illustrations are mostly video box covers and very few of those or the other photos have any sort of caption which makes them rather disjointed from the accompanying text."
3,Good if You Must Known Adult Cinema History,"The cover of this book is perhaps the best part. The text itself makes a very interesting reading for all those interested in the subject; and it's the only book I could find that has substantive materials. It covers American as well as foreign adult film industries.But I don't like the writing that much. I can't say exactly why. I wish the writing had been clearer and the presentation a little more compact.Still, a high recommendation to all adult film lovers. ;-)"
2,Not like description,"I bought these for the bubble glass but to my great disappointment this glass has absolutely no bubbles as described and as pictured. Just plain solid blue. So, i feel like I wasted money and was deceived. Would not order again from this company. They are fine quality and delivery was on time but not what I wanted."
2,A good reference,"This is one of those books that appear just before their subject matter becomes a fashion. The most famous example is Courant-Hilbert ""Methods of Mathematical Physics"", which contained the mathematics of quantum mechanics as if the authors had guessed what the future had in store. Hamermesh taught group theory for physicists just before SU(3), quarks, etc, dominated particle physics. Everybody learned groups from ""Hamermesh"". Now time passed, more specialized books appeared, physicists learned more mathematics... What of Hamermesh? Well, I always thought it was rather boring, a collection of methods with very little motivation. If one compares it with a modern book such as Inui, Tanabe, Onodera, one sees the difference: much more physical context. Hamermesh has, notwithstanding, done his job."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I'm not reviewing the product, because I tried to purchase it from at least 5 vendors advertising it, but NOBODY actually had it to sell. Even though it said ready to ship or in stock--NOPE, not one of them had it. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!"
3,Curious about the cover art,"RegardsI am the artist who did this cover art, but I never sold this image to this artist or publisher and wonder how to get in touch with the publisher. The information here does not list the publisher. Have not heard the album but can say Steven Helpurn is not an American Indian and has nothing to do with American Indians. Also not sure who the artist is. Music which truly and deeply originates from within and expresses American Indian culture is very rare. This is a moden music thing made with computers. Of course any musical sound can have value and beauty, so I am not being critical, only curious."
5,A compact and great-looking towel bar!,"We needed a short towel bar but an attractive one to match the other semi-Victorian-style (and some antique) bathroom fixtures, and weren't sure if we might have to trim off an inch or two off this one. However, because of the small diameter of the attaching cups we had plenty of room without having to trim the bar. The finish is great, the look perfect, and the price very reasonable. We may order another one!"
2,"okay stand, no light arms","The product comes with paint chipped off at various places, some metal parts appears rusted.The biggest disappointment is that it does not come with light arms. descriptions indicate that ""Copy Lights sold separately,"" which I interpreted as the actual lights in the images and not the adjustable light arm too. I just looked up ""Adorama RS-C150 Copy Light Set, Two Copy Lights with Sdjustable Arms"" and they are out of stock. so you will likely to be buying a stand alone copy stand without compatible light arms available.The shipping is almost $25, thus the price is not competitive compared to other sellers. Also, the shipment is poorly packaged, the corner of the base has wood/paint chipped off when arrived.I gave it two stars because the stand itself is easy to install, and fairly light. its quality is barely okay (chipped paints at various locations not due to shipping damage). but poor shipping package, and the image/descriptions are misleading."
3,interesting testimony but not a lot of investigation,"This book is supposed to collect the main letters Reznikoff sent during his whole life. However, it is difficult to understand what is left unpublished and what is out : there is no precise commentary on the selection criteria. What can easily be defined as a week point is the very few letters about the work, while so many are dull or sentimental notes reznikoff sent to his wife. So the final impression is that he was a fairly tender husband, was concerned by his friends... but one doesn't learn much more about his style, his approaches, his conception of poetry. (maybe 5% deal with these questions). So it is a rather superficial approach of his work, given by accidental remarks from time to time. Personally, it's not personal or sentimental or casual letters i'm the most interested in. The introduction is in the same mood : soft, friendly, useless."
2,Only for the noobs,"The first 178 pages concern such topics as how to use a computer, the web and a course management system ... and thus isn't particularly helpful if you have even a passing grasp of these matters. The middle section of the book - Teaching in The Online Classroom - is okay, though a much better treatment of teaching is in the venerable McKeachie's Teaching Tips by Wilbert J. McKeachie. If it's online activities you're really interested in, get Ryan Watkins' ""75 e-Learning Activities: Making Online Learning Interactive."" The last section of the book - New Trends and Opportunities - is little more than uncritical pontification and is probably worth skipping even if you found some utility in the material from the prior sections of the book."
4,Soft copy book,This book is everything that it was purported to be. The print is good with quality information for anyone interested in eLearning.
4,Tasco scope,"These scopes are excellent field scopes, good quality for a reasonable price, you can take them out without worrying if its going to get scratched or damaged like you would if you spent $900 on something that does exactly the same thing. Be advised that this product does not include rings to avoid any disappointmentDelivery was super fast and hassle free which makes a pleasant surpriseThoroughly recommended, good quality product."
2,Spend a few extra bucks and get a better scope,"This scope has good optics, but the focus and POI change as you vary the power."
3,Pokemon-how it began,"My son is an avid pokemon fan - he loves the show and the video games. These movies tell the tale about how it all began. My son did indicate that he thought the movies were a bit sad, but nonetheless, he's enjoyed them very much and has watched them several times."
