1,Don't bother if you are interested in learning,"I have to agree with the older gentlemen above. I am 28 years old and have pretty worthless IRA's and savings plans that I am trying to grow at a better rate. Before buying a book I like to read the good and bad reviews, and like most of the 1 star reviewers, I can't believe anyone gave this book 5 stars. I suppose from an investment point of view I would encourage the ignorant to waste their money chasing fast easy money, but for those who actually know or want to know more about investing and the workings of Wall Street, do yourself a favor and pass over this book. I don't know the average age of the readers of this book, but I am guessing that I must be older than most of them because even I can't help thinking this is a hollywood rendition of a ""real life"" experience."
4,Insight into a dirty business,Great read. Makes one think twice about doing any kind of business with investment banks. Buyer beware is their only creed and anyone who doesn't realize this could be in for a rude awakening.
5,Great book,"The book is clearly satire, and definitely exaggerates a bit, but it still gives you a sense of the Wall Street culture, where people are extremely wealthy but also extremely unrefined (scarfing greasy cheeseburgers while making millions). Very funny. Also extremely informative on topics such as the rise of mortgage bonds and junk bonds as financial tools. The book gives a great portrayal of the genius of the people behind these financial innovations. In fact, its portrayal of people in general is very funny and memorable. One final upside: there are some books, where, if you don't read them for about a week, you have no clue what's going on anymore. This is not one of those. There are relatively few people to keep track of, and they are described so well that you can't forget them.I would DEFINITELY recommend this book. Funny and informative, a window onto a strange culture known as Wall Street."
3,Mildly Amusing,"Michael Lewis' inside look at the heady days of Salomon Brothers during the 1980s and the decay that followed is a mildly amusing, albeit disjointed narrative with little new information. It is funny in parts and some of the character sketches make you pause but overall a strictly average book."
2,Fluff,"This book is about investment bankers at Salomon Brothers in the 1980's who are portrayed as spoiled crooked kids that were creating and exploiting inefficiencies in the capital markets to enrichen their firm and themselves.The educational and really interesting parts of this book could have been boiled down to 10 pages, max. The rest is filled with tales of office pranks and squabbles and the author's attempts at poetically describing the atmosphere at an investment bank through colourful descriptions of people and stories that aren't really that interesting. The book is largely fluff. Sorry to be so harsh.I would instead recommend Fortune's Formula by William Poundstone, which, to me at least, is much more exciting and educational."
5,Liar's Poker,"As someone who worked in the financial advising business this book convinced me there are a lot of people who work in the industry who should be doing something else. Their egos get in the way of doing what's best for their clients. It's a real shame. However, that being said, Liar's Poker is a very enjoyable read and books by Michael Lewis are always hard for me to put down."
5,Good Insider's Perspective,"Very well written. Fast moving. M. Lewis brings Wall Street to you in understandable terms. Exposes the financial hype for what it is. If you like finance, you will enjoy it; if you like learning about human nature, you will also like. If you enjoy both, you will love this book."
3,Perhaps time diminishes the work,"It's been almost 25 years since the publication of Liar's Poker and perhaps that has diminished the fascination with the Wall Street world depicted by Michael Lewis. A bunch of fat cats taking big bets on the market while putting clients, investors and their own firms at risk is not as eye opening as it might have been in 1989 when Liar's Poker was published. The characters as depicted in the book are for the most part two dimensional and not particularly compelling. The insight offered by Mr. Lewis into the workings of bond, equity and other markets are minimal. There's a bit of wit, and certainly we have Mr. Lewis to thank for bringing the term Big Swinging Dick into the lexicon, but overall I was hoping for a bit more meat from a writer of such well received works as Moneyball and the Big Short."
4,One-timer,"This one is a business school must read. You should be able to talk about the game, know about the book, and carry on an intelligent conversation. On the other hand, you won't read it more than once. Fairly easy read."
2,Pretty lame,I thought this would be more interesting. I still haven't finished the book and I bought it over 6 months ago. It's just dry. If you've ever worked on the floor of an actual exchange this is like kissing your sister. I have a totally different view of trading in the 80's and institutional trading isn't it
5,As good as the best from Tom Wolfe,A view of the guts of part of the finantial industry in a style that I found very similar to Tom Wolfe's ( no offense intended to either author). Instructive as well as entertaining.
3,Obvious Cry Baby,"I want you to realize that Michael Lewis is only one perspective albeit a very biased and skewed one at that. If you speak to any one who worked at Salomon they will bluntly tell you that the book is not completely factual. Michael Lewis has an agenda, and it is very obvious that he has it in for the Salomon and Wall Street traders. And, he is willing to bend the truth and exagerate things to make the people look like monsters. Using the endearing term of Human Pirhana speaks to this point. I loved the book, because it gives you somewhat of a perspective on the life of traders, but I don't think you truly know what it is you're up against until you go and do actual trading. I wouldn't believe everything you read in Liar's Poker, and I would weigh each word carefully, because Meriweather isn't the only playing Liar's Poker here. Enjoy, and don't let the book discourage you from hedge funds and investment banking, especially if you really love finance."
2,Disappointed,"After reading the reviews on Amazon, I was excited when this book finally arrived. However, after reading 3/4 of the book, I felt the reviews were highly misleading. Lewis is by no means a highly gifted writer. This book is sloppy and disorganized. He throws around dates and names in random pages, which leads the reader out of the loop. Most of the names could have been left out and weren't important to the story. A brief synopsis of the story goes like this ""Yah, we made a lot of money in the 1980s at Salomon Brothers"". And for the a whole synopsis, reiterate that 100 times in a 100 different ways. I'm so disappointed with this book."
3,Boring if work in the industry....,"If you a dying to work in the industry or imagine the stock market to be a big mystery this book might be more engaging.Personaly I found it a little boring and hard to get through. I am not impressed by the stories at all, and found it like listening to a sales person in a bar."
4,Interesting,Relevant especially even now. Events are current enough that the reader will recognize the players. Maybe too much detail at times.
4,"very entertaining, eye-opening","This was a very good read. It kept me entertained the whole time. I came away from it with a better understanding of the bond market and many of the Wall Street firms.I read the book after having it recommended by a friend who has a friend that made a killing as a bond trader. He was constantly relating stories from his days trading, and said the book was very close to the way it was when he was trading.Even if it is only half true, I realize that they make their money from commisions, not from making my money grow.If you are looking for Wall St. entertainment, I highly recommend it. If you are thinking of investing all your money with brokers, again I highly recommend it so you can rethink that plan."
4,liar's poker,"Liar's Poker was a good look at the mind set of the Wall Street personnel that created the money mechanisms that put America on the financial freefall that put us where we are today. A good listen for a long trip. Follow it with ""The Big Short"" for the next trip, it will broaden your understanding of greed and corruption."
4,Nice collection,"I've started to read several of his books but they're not really books. They're like a collection of essays. There's nothing really wrong with that, but I might be annoyed if I paid for it."
4,"Well Written, Great Story",Love the fact that he just let it all out... mind you it was from one perspective but still a great story about the idiots on wall street...
5,Captivating insight into how wallstreet really works,"Excellent penmanship, entertaining stories that encapsulate wallstreet in the 1980's. A hodge-podge of math, economics, politics, and character descriptions that provide valuable insight into why WallStreet has developed to what it is today. Great reading for beginners and veterans alike. Loved it."
5,The BIBLE for Finance Majors!!!,By far this book should be a MUST for all those mojoring in Finance like myself. It explains everything they don't teach you in school and prepares you to walk down Wall St. and state your claim. Liar's Poker helps explain many questions you could not ask in class. Laugh all the way from beginning to end. Thank you M. Lewis.
5,Simply the Best,"Want to know what happened on the street from an insider? Want to laugh while learning how the bonds market was created? Want learn of the ""glamorous"" life of a salesman? Then buy that book!"
3,This Might Just Be Worth Your Time,"I you're really into investment banking, or just bond mechanics, don't let the three star rating get you down. I study finance. I liked the book.I wouldn't say that it is a good book, so much as it is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in a) working on Wall Street (for historical perspective) or b) interested in bonds and, again, their history.Three stars for the general population. For broker/banker/trader hopefulls, five stars."
3,Call it a 2.5 rounded up,"This is a very well researched book, but not what I expected. I went into it thinking it would be like the ""In Search of Dracula""book(s) by the same author and it is not. It basically delves into Mary Shelly's past and tries to disprove that the book and the title came to her in a dream vs. her actually just putting together local folklore. I don't quite know if the author is trying to accuse her of plagarism or what but it is not a book like his Dracula non fiction works. If you are interested in delving into a writers pysche and possibly finding how a very popular story came about then this book is for you. If you want to know about the Frankenstein family in depth as he did Dracula, this book is not for you."
2,Don't watse your money on this pointless single,"I love Liars, but they're in serious danger of becoming laughably arch and out of touch. I'm sorry, but I don't like paying (...)for a single featuring one of the last album's weakest tracks, an unitelligible live cover, and a new track that is nothing but soft background music. The videos didn't help much either. The video for We Fenced Other Gardens With the Bones of Our Own is unintetionally funny. It does have a few creepy images that show potential, but ridiculous segements, like a choreographed dance with brooms, ruin the mood. The Sex Boy video is a fairly amusing collage of images, but it can be found on their website. The final video is just as boring as the POS song it is set to.Buy the album or the far superior Fins To Make Us More Fishlike EP instead."

4,You get the feeling that men like this really exist,"If you are interested in getting a glimpse into the world of cross-cultural relationships, infidelity, and one lonely man's search for happiness, then Russian Doll is a pleasant way to spend an evening.Hugo Weaving stars as Harvey, a bumbling bachelor nearing middle-age. The movies plot centers around how he and Katya, a Russian mail order bride find a way beyond their loneliness and happiness together.Unlike your typical mail order bride movie, Harvey doesn't order Katya. Evan, Harvey's best friend needs a place to ""stash"" his mistress, and enlists Harvey to marry her as a front.I won't spoil the movie, but I actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would.Weaving once again shows his versatility as he is able very believable in this role, a far departure from Mr. Smith, in the Matrix movies.Recommended!Cheers!"
3,Handsome...but ?,"I bought this book based on the reviews that it recieved onAmazon.The models are very handsome, in a street tough sort of way.Which can be quite appealing. And being French makes them evenmore so.But it would've been an even better book if there were more full-frontal poses inside.Otherwise it is an excellent book of photographs."
5,Good lyrics - finally something appropriate for kids,"I bought this for my daughter and it's been in the CD player on repeat since we opened the package. Finally a selection of songs where the lyrics are actually appropriate for little kids. The singers are quite good too. I can actually stand to hear this over and over and over... :) Also, as a bonus, there is a DVD that comes with this CD. It's cute and fun. My daughter is 6 and now a big fan of Girl Authority."
1,lmplausible,"I do beleive that Miss Knowlton was abused by her father..but as for claims regarding Elizabeth Short, I just can not believe it. There is no evidence and the lengthy murder description that she 'witnessed' was excessive and wholly implausible. The book is heavy on the gore and not much on anything regarding evidence. I consider myself well read on the subject having develeoped a fascination for the case in my teens and just can not digest anything this book has to offer. Also the 'deformed/infantile genitalia' is a popular misconception/urban myth, and in fact she could (and according to Red Manley-mind you that is only his word) have intercourse, but could never give birth or have a proper period, but other than that everything was of the norm."
1,Incest Case Study,"This is a disturbing book, in many ways.People who are interested in the corrosive, poisonous effects of incest on its victims will find this book interesting, as will mental health professionals, particularly those people on both sides of the contentious debate about the validity of recovered early childhood memories.Black Dahlia students, look elsewhere. This book is not about the crime in which you are interested."
1,"How'd this thing get published, anyway?","I just lost all respect for this publisher. There is no, I repeat NO, evidence that the ramblings of this pitiful woman have ANY basis in fact. Even worse, it's poorly written! Clearly there are some disturbed individuals involved in the production of this book. I kept getting the distinct feeling that these authors enjoyed writing those torture and mutilation scenes just a little bit too much. I tried to sell my copy at a yard sale for a dime. There were no takers. I suggest you save your money. There are too many GOOD TRUE crime books available to waste your time and money on this pornographic fantasy."
1,A Very Vivid Imagination,"I originally read this book because I was interested in The Black Dahlia. I was very disappointed. The author tells of the horrible crimes she witnessed by her father, but never could they find any evidence to substantiate her claims. When led to places where bodies were supposed to be buried, they found nothing. I have to say that this book was a waste of my time to read."
1,"Lurid, ghoulish nonsense.","""Daddy Was the Black Dahlia Killer"" by Janice Knowlton is, at best, a tenuous and unconvincing bit of pop pyschology mixed with tabloid sensationalism; at its worst, it is lurid, ghoulish nonsense that causes the reader to feel defiled and exploited for even taking time to read it. If this isn't pornography, then pornography does not exist."
1,Highly implausible!,"This is the kind of story that casts doubt on the concept of repressed memories due to abuse. The accused killer in this case toted a body, severed at the waist, around in a duffle bad for several days, removing it, raping it, and even throwing it into a swimming pool without losing any entrails. Further there was an accusation of religious sex abuse... pretty much the kind of stuff you would expect to see on Jerry Springer. Unlikely."
1,I plan to burn this book shortly after typing this,"I am...at a loss for words when it comes to this book. Never before have I read such a thoroughly useless and perverse book. Not perverse in the content, but perverse in the motives of the author. Janic Knowlton's book is a a sick and blatant attempt to attain her 15 minutes of fame. Let me tell you, this woman deserves nothing less than what she got (to be dismissed and attacked by critics). The entire book seems to be an ""Ode to why we all feel sorry for poor, poor Janice."" I can understand that she was a victim of her father's abuses, but to use the name of a horribly murdered young woman (for whatever reason) is simply appalling. I simply cannot offer enough criticism for this book. The author(s) take circumstancial evidence and claim that they've found the end all be all of solutions to the murder of Beth Short."
2,I found this book extremely disturbing.,"I believe Ms.Knowelton was abused but I don't be- lieve her father committed the murder of Elizabeth Short. She believes there was a police cover up, but why? Her father, George had no money or power to buy his freedom to continue to kill. I also felt that there was just way too much detail on her sexual abuse. The alleged mutilations of dead babies was just too much. Instead of giving evidence to support her story she just attempted to poke holes in all the other theories and evidence. It was hard to read and stays with you long after you put it down, unfortunatly."
1,Delusional,This is one of the worse books I've ever read. This poor woman needed to believe that the abuse she suffered had to be connected to a greater evil. It simply doesn't make sense in connection with the case. Add to it the fact that she was bipolar and eventually committed suicide- I think anything this woman said was warped by her own need to validate her experiences.
2,"Unconvincing, But An OK Read","The Black Dahlia murder mystery, which is one of this country's most talked-about murder cases is presented here by Janice Knowlton in a fashion that makes for great reading, but is of little actual signifigance to the case. Knowlton writes that Elizabeth Short (The Black Dahlia) died at the hands of her abusive father, George Knowlton. Some parts of the book are great, some are plodding, but overall, this is just fictional. If you want a great book on the case, buy ""Severed,"" by John Gilmore, which is probably the only ""real"" book on the case."
2,Poor Janice,"I can not say this book was well written. It did way too much skipping around to hold my concentration. I usually will finish a book of this size in one day. It took me over a week to finish this story. It also appeared that Janice wanted to use catchy phrases,throughout the book, that just backfired. I do belive Janice had the most horrible of childhoods, and did truely belive her daddy WAS the black dahlia killer. I pray Janice finds the peace in death that she never had in life."
2,Unconvincing,"I saw someone mention this book on a documentary I watched and decided it looked kind of interesting. I will have to say I've enjoyed reading it, but the book was more about Janice Knowlton (The author) and her childhood than Beth Short. Don't get me wrong, the book is very entertaining and interesting but I highly doubt anything in this book happened. If you're looking for FACTS about the Black Dahliah case then this isn't the book for you. If anything in this book is true, I would be shocked. But if you're just curious about what Janice Knowlton has to say about this case, then this is a great book for you! I'm convinced Jan Knowlton was a very troubled woman and none of this is true."
1,A HODGE-PODGE OF MAKE-BELIEVE,"This book was a disappointment. I am a true crime reader and found this to be nothing more than self-indulgence on the part of the subject, Janice Knowlton, and plain bad writing by Michael Newton who usually writes factual, good bite-sized takes on crime and criminals. I was bored and irritated with this book and finally trashed it. I suppose there is value as far as Knowlton sharing her past abuses, if they actually happened (I am a female who experienced sexual abuse by a brother), but in this case who cares and where does it lead? The 'recovered memory' theory has been done to death and certainly doesn't work here. The reader is advised to check out the book by John Gilmore, entitled SEVERED, which so far appears to be the only authentic nonfiction account on the Black Dahlia murder case."
1,Read at your own discretion,"I picked up this book because I have been interested in ""The Black Dahlia"" murder for many years. I fully regret the decission. I had only stopped having nightmares about my stillborn baby a few months before reading this horrible book and afterwards the nightmares came back. Ms. Knowlton obviously had a horrid childhood, that I don't disbelieve but everything she had to say about Beth Short and the allegation that her father murdered her is don't believe at all. I hope she gets help, no one should write such disgusting things about people I doubt they even met, let alone the all too graphic details on how her father ""got rid"" of the dead babies. It should be obvious Ms. Short was not killed by a blow to the head, just look at the morgue shots, no damage to her head at all. Now Ms.Knowlton is claiming sexual abuse by Gene Autry, who's next? Is no one safe? I'm just waiting for an allegation against the president any day now."
1,Pity that one-star-rating was the lowest I could choose,"Reading literally hundreds of books a year, many of those true crime, seldom has a book made me this angry. Knowlton is one sad woman, slandering people who can't defend themselves anymore, offering not one shred of evidence supporting her preposterous stories, apparently to get some attention she never had but obviously needs, no matter what. What is worse is that this book has the danger of making me disbelieve any stories of suppressed childhood memories of abuse etc., which is what I really don't want to happen. If you want to read about the Black Dahlia case, read Gilmore's book 'Severed'. If you want to learn about the lengths sad, unstable women will go to, read this one. But I really wouldn't recommend it. Being a woman myself it makes me really really angry that women like this Knowlton person make sure emancipation will still be a long long way off."
3,Nice but kinda pricey,"The quality of these bath salts is high, however, if you follow the suggested usage instructions, you only get 2 soaks for $12.00Like I said ""nice but kinda pricey"""
4,Great!,It's a great story but a little slow at first. But it's C. S. Lewis so if you stick in there you know it's going to be great.
3,The Silent Planet,"I have to say I really like the title and idea behind Earth's name. This was my first introduction to a novel of Lewis, and it was a real page turner. But this book reminds me of Ayn Rand's novels, in the sense that the story is sometimes good filler between speeches where the authors get down to business. In Silent Planet this occurs mainly in the grand finale. This is, though, convenient for me now since I read this book for history of science research.I feel bad calling the in-between filler, because I don't think it entirely was. There was good integration and demonstration of other points in the novel. At first glance, the softest part in the novel is the coexistence of the three intelligent species. It is rather... naiive? At least too idealistic. Are these species the ideal Christians, who follow commandments and the way of grace perfectly because of total faith and belief in God? This picture isn't argued by Lewis."
3,The battle of good vs. evil continues,"I was intregued about this book because I like science fiction. It is a well written classic, but it more philosophical about the subject of good vs. evil and the evils of mankind. Great visual images of the planet (I won't give away which one) but it was less science fiction than I expected."
5,A Good Read,"Although I somewhat knew the basic plot of the book before I read it I still found it a pleasant read. Lewis tells a pretty good sci-fi story of a kidnapped man named Ransom finding his way around Malacandra (Mars). The wonder and awe expressed by Ransom in the book is almost worth the read in and of itself. The 'joyful cosmology' of seeing space as the ancients did, calling them the 'heavens' is shown to be superior to the modern notion that space is just cold dead hostile nothingness. This is contrasted with the 'joyless cosmology' of Weston who accepts some half-baked social darwinist philosophy. The aliens were also quite interesting, although I think that Lewis could have done more with the sorns. The hross were cool though.This was a good start to the trilogy."
5,Thought Provoking Portrayal of Societal Strictures,A crisply written delving into the Western humanoid psyche. Lewis's unparalleled imagination weaves a thought provoking portrayal of our societal strictures - themes as apropos today as when originally published in 1938.
2,Struggled to get through it!,"I'm not an avid Sci-Fi reader but came with high expectations, CS Lewis being the writer of the Narnia series, which I read as a child, many, many years ago.I didn't enjoy this novel, with the exception, of Lewis' wonderful descriptive language. In particular, the way he describes the beauty of Malacandra is breathtaking.I thought I was reading something akin to the Planet of the Apes, but without the sense of foreboding that one feels when you watched the TV series version of the aforementioned. I was so tempted to put the novel down, but have a personal policy not to do that, and figured as it was only 150+ pages I'd grin and bear it.Yes, there is a message there about good vs evil and God, but I don't think it was that inspiring or significant.I'm sure my conclusions are heavily influenced by the fact that I don't typically read such novels. I won't be reading the 2 sequels."
3,Ordinary fantasy book.,"I think it's just an ordinary fiction book...Dr.Ransom was abducted,brought to another weird planet,then came back to earth.Perhaps I used to read A.Hitchcock fiction books,that are much2 fun than this.That's why this book isn't fun enough."
5,Short review but I enjoy this book a lot,"As both a author and reader of fiction, I enjoyed Out of the Silent Planet very much. I guess I have always liked a book that could hold my attention and make me think at the same time. Read this story.Tommy Taylor -The Second Virgin Birth"
5,Beautiful narrative.,I found this book hard to put down over the short span it was read in. Lewis' masterful words put the character's point of view in perfect context throughout the entire novel. And his subtle approach towards life beings on other planets made for a very believable/realistic adventure. I can't wait to get my hands on the next two books in the Trilogy.Read my other reviews for great Christian books + CDs.
2,Reads very old fashioned,Unlike some stories written a while back (Isaac Asimov for example) which are still entertaining I found this book too descriptive and thus very boring. Perhaps I was looking for more adventure and what I got was a discussion of the human race and how bad (or in the authors terms bent) we are.
2,really weird,"I love C. S. Lewis usually, but his book was just a little too weird. The description of the other world he is taken to is fine as are the creatures that live there, but the kidnappers are over the top. I had to really struggle to finish the book and have no desire to read the other books."
2,Different to be sure,"This is my first C.S.Lewis read. I am not sure if I will try any of his other works based on this experience. I found his combination of ""big"" words and strange ""other worldly"" names to be off putting to my reading tastes. Some of the paragraphs seemed non-sensical and therefore hard to follow."
5,"Story, Religion, and Philosophy","Like many older works of science fiction we now know that the planetary descriptions are definitely not correct. But, like many of those works, the story stands on its own merits outside of the science.Out of the Silent Planet is the first book in a trilogy which explores a great number of religious and philosophical questions by taking the protagonist to Mars (in this book) and Venus (in the next). The story is still fun to read, even on the sixth or seventh go-around. The plot is very well constructed. The villains are chosen to represent certain philosophical viewpoints and thus are a little latter than the protagonist and several of the Martian characters.Although I think anyone could enjoy the story, to fully enjoy it you will need to be at least in sympathy with Lewis' Christian viewpoint, as it flavors the entire work, and crucial plot elements (such as the entire organizational structure of the planets) are based on Lewis' Christian speculations and readings."
4,Great science-fiction!,"This is top-class SF! C.S. Lewis always writes with wisdom and imagiantion, nw I look forward to read the rest og his triology. If you like his books about Narnia, you'll love this!"
5,Ideal,"This book takes the reader on a fantastic journey full of wonderful descriptions. It also is incredibly and deeply thought-provoking like most other of Lewis' books, but yet can be enjoyed for the story and details. I highly recommend this book, especially to discuss with a friend or group.The trip takes Dr. Ransom, the protagonist, to another planet where Ransom finds out what life could have been like without the break caused in the Garden of Eden. This could spur many meditations on what life is meant to be like and how life can be more joyful. Classic Lewis, one of the best that I have read of his. If you like his fiction, get this book."
5,AMAZING,"This book is amazing, there is not a better word to describe it, I read it over and over again. C.S. Lewis is hands down my favorite Author. What a great man and thinker he was. If you have not picked up this trilogy I advise you to do so. I wont tell you anything about it cause I would hat to spoil it for you. AMAZING!"
2,Review,"Unfortunately, I didn't find this very good. I hardly had a picture for anything anyone looked like and it was quite confusing. I wanted to finish this, And I partly rushed through it to get it over with. Unfortunately, 2/5."
3,Just written too long ago....,"We know so much more now...... it is almost impossible to enjoy this book, unless only for it's strictly literary qualities, and much as I love CS's writing, this isn't his best form.I probably wouldn't enjoy the John Carter books now either, although the movie did, I think, a pretty good job.God, how I devoured Jules Verne and Edgar Rice Burroughs back in the sixties! If you happen to be in that stage of life where you are seeking a return to your innocent and wonder filled youth; sure, read this series."
3,CS Lewis Out of the Silent Planet,"This science fiction novel written in 1939 by the great cs Lewis, is a great look at some entertaining science fiction with a moral belief system by the author in place."
3,Journey to Mars,"The first part of a space trilogy. In this novel Lewis subtly injects spirituality as compared to his better known works of Christian apologetics. This journey does not have the powerful impact that many of his other novels have had.The story begins on earth; a man (Ransom) stumbles on to two men with plans to kidnap another person on to their spacecraft; Ransom ends up being kidnapped instead. The space ride ends with a landing onto a distant planet. Confrontation with aliens is soon after. Ransom ends up escaping. He encounters many different life forms, and discovers they do not contain the evil that exists within us. After being summonsed, Ransom ends his journey with this higher being. He and his two kidnappers are released from the planet, and head back to earth.Lewis' English dialect is noticeable. The punctuation usage can make going slow.Wish you wellScott"
4,Exciting until the last 40 pages.,"It's a Si-Fi plot as a vehicle for philosophy. Some really good food for thought but the plot cleaned up at the end a little too well, ending too contrived. Exciting and driving reading until the last 40 pages or so."
4,Nuggets of ideas and imagery; a breath of fresh air,"Five out of five is way to high -- the characters are plastic, the narrator has a set of annoying mental habits, and the odd descriptions of a truly odd world are often downright confusing. Three out of five is too low -- the book is original and often paints its colorful world with grace and style. (3.5?)This book IS like Narnia -- a book of Christian ideas told in with almost adolescent simplicity. The reason you'll like it is because, occasionally, it hits home. And when it does, you realize that the world C.S. Lewis is painting, however simple, is one you would like to see more of.If you need a quick idealistic reprieve from your modern world, give it a try."
3,Good Read,"This first installment of The Space Trilogy takes us on a moral journey through space hinting that maybe it is we who are the ""not so friendly alien race"" for a change. Some portions of this book would make HG Wells proud but I found the religious undertones a bit tiring. I have not as of yet read the other two books in the trilogy, but Out of the Silent Planet held my curiousity long enough for me to consider doing so. If I could give half stars i would throw this pamphlet-esq novel 3 1/2."
4,A lot of patina on the science fiction,But I found myself craving the story. I'm biased toward Lewis in general but I clearly loved this story and would recommend it.
5,Very good book!,This is a very good book and I highly recommend it. Anybody who loves anything by CS Lewis will enjoy this trilogy.
3,A little verbose but OK,"This turned out to be more interesting than I had anticipated, and spurred me to read the second book in the trilogy. Which was AWFUL. I certainly won't bother with the third book."
4,"Science Fiction Purists, enter here:",I very much enjoyed the mix of C.S. Lewis' ideas of human nature within a sci-fi purist setting. This is a work that should not be missed.
5,This was a fantastic book,If you love fantasy filled action books with a great story line you should read Out of the Silent Planet. I loved how Ransom overcame his fears and realized that life on other worlds arent always as Science-fiction and other people describe it. It also has the feature of it is strongly related to religious beleifs and of how Earth is the Silent PLanet because of the Devil's works. It was short sweet and to the point. Out of the Silent Planet was just another wonderful fantasy created by the mind of C. S. Lewis!
3,Beautiful Language,"Mr. Lewis had a stunning method of enlightening his readers with a highly inventive tale. He was extremely detailed and forthcoming especially on stressing the importance of his story's ethical objective. Reading the book, it seemed to me that I was experiencing a philosophical journey through the mind of an expert with extensive imagination, rather than merely appraising a science fiction or a fantasy. The characters were specifically ordained. Ransom, the main person, could be remarkably hysterical at times in his conducts, thoughts, and speech. So were the other beings that were mindfully created by Mr. Lewis. It was a clear-cut high moral adventure. I could visualize Mr. Lewis verbally communicating me the account beautifully but the whole exploration left me vacant. The narrative did not peak my interest even though I truly benefit from the amazing use of the English language that was justly the incredible skill of Mr. Lewis."
5,"A work of true genius,","Overshadowed in recent years by the much better known Narnia series, this marvelous, beautifully written book is only distantly related to the science fiction genre in which it is typically classed. In fact it is an allegory, shedding rich light on the Creation, the Fall and the Redemption. Read it!"
3,A Fatal Lapse,"Lewis's ""Cosmic Trilogy"", of which this is the first book, is perhaps his best fiction, which--regrettably--is a somewhat left-handed compliment.His major defect is that he can never quite succeed in suppressing his didactic Christianity. The bulk of this book is, as it was intended to be, very H. G. Wells in tone, and in the main it is successfully so. But, as always with Lewis, when it comes to wrapping things up, he just cannot resist the temptation to get out The Really Big Hammer Of Obviousness and beat his readers over the head with it repeatedly, just to be sure that even a drunken half-wit will Get It.All in all, this book is ""a good read"", albeit ultimately unsatisfying."
5,one has to wonder,"could there be life on other planets? Oh well.The book was a very good read and brought up some questions for you to think about with out straight out asking them. Lewis is very good at doing that, and after reading this book I hope that you'll actually think about the questions it raises."
4,Entertaining and Thought-provoking,"I was reminded of how excellent C. S. Lewis' command was of the English language. The consistently appealing story line, coupled with his protagonist's philosophical observations as his adventure progressed, made for a most engrossing tale. If you enjoy a thoughtful story that gives you the opportunity to reflect on how you look at your own world, I believe you'll like this book."
4,Waiting for 2 and 3,"I did like the story. I've read 7 of Lewis's non-fiction works and really expected this bookto have some spectacular impact on my thinking. That did not happen, but that was possibly my lack. I'm waiting for 2 and 3 of the Trilogy-Maybe the light will come on."
4,"Excellent read, and a great deal of insight","This is the first book of Lewis' Space Trilogy and it has all the wonderful qualities of a SciFi/fantasy book mixed with a certain amount of theological and philosophical intellectualism that one would expect from such a distinguished author.First published in 1943, Out of the Silent Planet transcends sense of time and place with a focus on the greater themes of life, death and the pursuit of joy rather than specific scientific details. That the book is full of allegory is not in doubt, but even the most cliched moments are written artfully and with a panache seldom seen in the genre.Those who enjoyed Mary Doria Russell's The Sparrow will probably also enjoy this book, which is considerably less violent, but explores the same themes. Lewis ends the book with a compelling epilogue that leaves you hungry for the remaining two books in the trilogy. Prepare to not only suspend your beliefs, but to come away with a tremendous amount of personal insight as well."
2,Great Deal,We use this to scrape paint off the floor in our Paint room where we paint our Portable Storage Buildings. It works Great. [...]

3,Disappointing,"I really enjoyed the book Hallam Foe and couldn't wait to see the film. However, now that I have I do not have that fulfillment I was expecting. The story stays fairly true to the source material, but it greatly lacks the emotion of the book. Most notably, the motivations of Hallam are unconvincing, even unclear in the film. Hallam has strange, disgusting habits, and the lack of realism and relatability ruins any chance that the viewer will sympathize with such a character. Instead of odd and endearing, he is just odd.Another aspect that I was disappointed with was the score of the film. I like the music and the bands on their own, and as a standalone album it works fine. However, the songs seemed too forced, too frequent, and too prominently placed in the film. Instead of complementing the story, they overpowered it.Overall, if the plot sounds interesting to you, I highly suggest reading the book, and not to expect as much from the film."
4,to music fan,"to the guy that wrote that review in august 98 that said the band doesnt want people to buy it, the suicide machines, its management or any others related to TSM, never said not to buy this CD, they even sell it themselves through there merchandising catalog and at their site, thesuicidemachines.com. Can't wait for there new CD, due out Jan/Feb '00"
4,Where's the handlebar lock?,"The Amazon reviewer states ""When kids get tired of pedaling, parents can lock the handlebars in place and steer via a push bar that attaches to the back of the bike."" It does come with a push bar, but I don't see how the handlebars lock in place. The box the Supertrike 4 came in says nothing about the handlebar locking in place. Neither does the instruction book. I will probably return the trike, since I specifically wanted this feature. It does, however, look like a durable, smooth-riding trike."
5,An excellent product - durable and fun for years!,"We pondered long and hard before spending the money on this tricycle for our son. Well, it now belongs to #2 son, and is still in perfect condition. In fact the 5 year old STILL loves to ride this thing.The wheels are perfect for all kinds of neighborhood terrain, and I LOVE the steer handle. I steer the little one along while the big one rides his big boy bike and everyone is happy.I am VERY impressed with the durability of this product. Recommended!"
4,Very good but one safety flaw,"Overall this trike is well designed with one major exception related to safety:Our granddaughter was not quite tall enough to keep her feet on the pedals during a full rotation and we were pushing her with the handle. One of her foot slipped off the pedal and got jammed between the pedal and the front-wheel fork. Luckily, we were walking very slowly at the time and she was wearing shoes with a very thick and rigid sole. Otherwise, her foot could easily have been broken. The solution is to extend the frame to one of the 4 adjustments so that a child can't reach the pedals until he/she can pedal by himself. The manufacturer should make the front wheel free wheeling in the reverse rotation or install footrests."
5,Came back for another One!,"My husband and I bought this Supertrike for our son when he turned 2. He was so close to peddling by himself, the push bar for a week was all he needed. He has gotten so many miles out of this, I just recently bought one for my neice who just turned 2. She loves it. We have a stone driveway and the wheels make the ride a lot more bearable and it hasn't worn out after a year and a half. We still have years left. It's a bit on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for. Those plastic tire bikes, keep them. I like the all-terrain tires and so does my son and neice. I would recommend this to anyone."
3,ok tricycle,"I bought this bike for my 2 1/2 year old son because I wanted something sturdy and reasonably priced.I was stuck between the Kettler Kettrike and this one.I bought this one because I thought it was an inexpensive version of the Kettler brand. It was, but it was by Kiddio (didn't realize that they were two different mftrs, but description stated that this bike was made by Kettler).I assembled the bike myself in under an hour. I just had difficulty with the directions. It didn't specify which tool to use for each job.secondly, it was hard to steer. Plus, my son had difficulty peddling (not sure if this is from inexperience, or what, but we're going to give it another go tonight).the plastic bucle came off and was difficult to put back on.I guess that you get what you pay for."
5,Not for a young toddler,"After reading the great reviews I purchased this trike when my daughter was maybe 20 or so months b/c it had the push bar and I thought I could just push her until she was able to ride. She is now 2 1/2 and still cannot reach the pedals!!! I still have to push it and yes, the pedals do not lock and it hits her heals. It is a great little trike but not for the younger children. I am looking at buying another model simply b/c it is still going to be awhile before she can reach the pedals."
5,Best Trike out there!!!,"My son is 3 1/2yrs old an loves this Trike. The trike was easy to put together..came with all the tools needed to assemble. It took me about 45min or so. The handle bar is great for teaching him how to pedal, the dump bed is great for putting Drinks in while out on a walk, the brake is great for teaching what ""Stop"" means, it is very quite, has a smooth ride(so it seems) and it does not tip that easy. He has almost ""tipped"" twice but it never went over. I have nothing bad to say about this Trike. This is a very good purchase...go buy this one if you are looking for a fun & safe Trike. love it, love it & love it!!!!"
5,Worth the Money,"I bought this trike for my son when he was 1 1/2. We loved the handle so we could push him on it until he learned to pedal. Once he got to that point, he rode it all the time. He is now 3 1/2 and still rides it even though he has a bigger bike. Wherever we go with this trike, it is a hit with all the kids. Everyone wants to ride it!! Durable and worth the money. I would highly recommend this over the classic red trike any day."
4,A very good buy!,"We shopped Radio Flyer brand, Kettrike & Kiddio- For the price we really felt theat this trike was the best. The radio Flyer trikes felt very flimsy (see other reviews) & Kettrike was too expensive. I have a day care & all my kids love to ride this one- even the big kids. It is very sturdy.It has a brake handle & the tires are very quiet & smooth riding. The seat is adjustable. The only feature I wish this trike had was Freewheel but we are going to try a footrest & see how it works out."
1,disappointed,"I was in the market for a tricycle for my daughter's 2nd b-day.I was going to buy a Radio Flyer, but the one I was looking at got bad reviews. So I found this Kiddio, had wonderful reviews!Bought it, received it, put it together by myself (2 hrs). It was by far the hardest thing I ever put together!:( Next bike I buy will already be operational!! that's for sure!!When my daughter and I tested it out, she was steering, so I COULDN'T!!! Not Good!! and we all of a sudden came to a dead stop, her foot was stuck between the wheel and pedal!! She wasn't hurt.:)!!!!VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!"
3,KIDDIO SUPERTRIKE 4,"Adam loved it, but the handle bars keep coming loose and Pap Pap has to keep tightening them with a wrench."
1,Not happy with this at all,"Our daughter got this for Christmas this past year and it has yet to be realiable as far as the screws staying in the front forks that are supposed to hold the pedals, we have called the manufacturer and explained to them the problem and they keep telling us that the replacement parts are still on back order, we first called them as soon as the trike was put together and noticed the problem. We definately would not recommend this product to ANYONE concerned with safety. This toy has all the elements to have a recall put on it but that has yet to be done. The manufacturer doesn't seem to be in any hurry to correct the problem and my daughter is going to be wanting to ride it outside within the next couple of weeks and I am unable to let her because of this safety issue. I'm hoping that I can return the trike to ToysRUs this weekend and get something more safer for our daughter."
5,"Makes order of Cairo's chaos, in a readable way..","Anyone who has been to Cairo, wandered its streets, and read about its history, will still have trouble fathoming what one sees and its relationship to the city's long and complex past. The author skillfully wades through all of these cultural and historical waters while focusing on the consistencies of the city's history and of the character of its people rather than on any dialectic between a troubled present and the glorious past.Rodenbeck will take the reader through 5000 years of Cairo's history and while giving him the sensation of having been in all of the city's forms from Pharonic Memphis until the present. The reader is there, in every metaphorphisis of the city, in Memphis, in Fustat, in Fatimid Al-Qahirah, in the Citerdal and the European-style quarters. This book is the closest thing that one can have to a time machine, the reader will feel as if he is there in the ancient, midevil, Mamluke and colonial times, and also in the present."
3,Chatty and reasonably credible history of a city,"This is a generally well-written and decently translated history of the Egyptian capital. There is more information and detail than you want at times, but the personal stories and narratives compensate for the over verbiage. Worth reading if you're planning a trip to Cairo."
3,Not bad but not what i expected,"I'll be visiting Cairo next month so i wanted to read something about this city.The book is not bad when it comes to history.The author explains the political,economical and social changes with accuracy and insight.However he lets out,what i believe, important history about the city.He doesnt go into details regarding The Citadel or the islamic buildings in the city.He just mentioned them when it is relevant to the story his telling.I felt that, as i was going to be a first time visitor to the city, i wasnt getting all the neccesary info or inside scoop on the monuments ,buildings and landmarks that makes Cairo a great city.I think the author falls short in this regard.But as an introduction to the city itself is very good and gives color to the account."
3,"It was okay,but could use more description",i feel that the book was good but not apealing to all people
3,Highly readable history of Cairo,"A must-read history of Cairo. A well written history of this interesting capital city. The writing style adopted by Mr Rodenbeck skirts the usual heaviness of history books, and he has created a highly readable book, quite sympathetic to Cairenes. The last third of the book deals with the insurmountable social and economical problems in modern Cairo, the ascendancy of a newly moneyed class, crassly disconnected from the remaining of its inhabitants, and with the city's cultural vacuum."
3,Missing Song Found,"YO YO YO,For all you looking for that cool song at the beginning of the movie it is....The Bangles - Tear Off Your Own Head. Yup it's not on the soundtrack, but that is the name of the first song that is playing as the girls are getting ready for school. Enjoy. Wish they had put it on the soundtrack. I hate when they put in weird songs instead of the ones that everyone really wants to hear."
3,HELP WITH SONG!,"What is that song where Roxy (Mary-Kate) is [dancing] && [waving her drum sticks around] to get to her seat on the train? It's not on the soundtrack, but I want it. Please help!"
4,Excellent soundtrack!,I got this CD for my 16th birthday last year and I really like it! Here's what I think of the songs on the New York Minute soundtrack:1) Curbside Prophet '04- Rating: 5/10. This song is a little boring and too slow.2) Vacation- 8/10. I really like that tune!3) Hey Driver- 10/10. My favorite song from the CD!4) Suffragette City- 10/10. I also love this one!5) Wave Goodbye- 6/10. This song is okay.6) Shake Your Coconuts- 7/10. Good song!7) Rubberneckin'- 8/10. I love the remix!8) Please Don't Tease- 10/10. Great song!9) One Way or Another- 5/10. I'm not fond of this one.10) Shake It- 9/10. Excellent!11) Doing Time- 9/10. Fantastic!12) Bring On The Bling- 7/10. Pretty good.This CD didn't have ONE song below a 5/10!I highly recommend purchasing this soundtrack. You won't be disappointed!
3,Simple Plan and Jason Mraz,"The best singers/bands are probaly Simple Plan and Jason Mraz, why because they rock!Also Mary-Kate gets to sing so you get to hear her."
3,a good soundtrack...but i want better.,"being a manhattan girl myself i could not help but listen to the new york minute soundtrack.i was satisfied with it, however, there is only so much a soundtrack can ever really do for you.the donnas bring a much needed track to the album and simple plan is also featured.i did not at all like mary-kate's pethetic attemp at sining but the rest was all and all a good soundtrack.even if you did not like the movie give the new york minute soundtrack a chance, you will probally like it.it has a little something for everyone."
3,the song,does anyone know the name and the artist of the song that plays when mk is making her way to her seat in the train??? she is pretending to play the drums on the other seats??? it is about 5 minutes into the movie????? if know what it is please let me know at jessie_claire88@hotmail.com
5,Fantastic surreal performances,"These three black and white performances(two in Germany and one in Belgium) sport great performances by Coltrane, his quartet and guests Oscar Peterson, Stan Getz and Eric Dolphy. Wynton Kelly plays piano on the first track rather than McCoy Tyner. I was amazed at the quality of cinematography and editing. The last performance in Belgium in '65 has inspired performances all around and is visually stunning and surreal. Apparently, it was a very cold auditorium or outdoors. The performers' bodies, especially drummer Elvin Jones, literally steam!!! It was great to see how Coltrane's stage presence evolved from rather stilted to dynamic like a charismatic preacher. Things start a little slow and the bowed bass solos seem to add little, but the early Peterson solo and then all of the latter tracks blew me away! No interviews, no narration. Roughly 90 minutes of music."
5,Wow!!!,"This is my 5th purchase of the Jazz Icon series, and ifyou are a Coltrane fan, you must have this DVD. You'llbe saying to yourself, big dummy, I should have got thebox sets."
3,Its alright,"This book is alright for a basic course but lacks some vital deffinitions. Also, some vocabulary words are hilited and some are left without making them difficult to find. In a few cases there are no deffinitions for words."
3,LP70+,"I bought this projector for business presentations. It is very small and light weight. The first one I had failed immediately. The power supply was bad. I sent it to the repair facility in Louisville, KY. After a month they were still waiting for parts so they replaced it. The second time I used the new one it went dark midway through a presentation. It worked fine after I let it cool off. I really like the small size and power of the unit. I just hope that mine is an isolated case."
1,Terrible!!!!,"The initial projector was D.O.A. and I was given a refurbished one in return. It worked OK but the color was off. After about 5 months later it developed a shadow on the right edge. I sent it in for repair and when it returned, it would not focus beyond 3 feet. I sent it in for repair again and it just returned. It now powers itself down as soon as it turns the lamp on.This projector is a DUD!"
2,Item condition was garbage.,I ordered an art book. What I got was a book covered in brown paint.every page had some sort of paint on it. Some completely covered.others had sharpie. Other than the fast shipping they did not meetexpectations.
5,Best way to learn for the price!!!,"I purchased this book for only ten dollars to improve my skills at animating animals. Of coarse, animating requires a large amount of drawings and an artist that can pump them out in a time efficient manner. So as a poor lowly student, I needed a book that would teach me fast. Jack Hamm's book was exactly what I needed. First of all, unlike most 'how to' art books, this one wasn't beefed up with alot of mumbo-jumbo text; but instead there are alot of informative serial drawings. This book is a definite two thumbs up on my list. For ten bucks you can't beat it!"
3,Not as detailed as you would like,"I purchased this book for my son, who loves to draw. I have bought him several ""how to draw"" books over the years, but I was a little disappointed with this one. The instructions on the majority of the animals included are minimal. There are only a few animals within the book that actually show a step by step on creating the drawing. For most of the illustrations, you will see the first step (a circle, a few boxes outlining a shape), and then the next picture is the completed product (a professional and complex drawing). Not very helpful for the most part."
5,Can't go wrong with Jack Hamm,"I've purchased many sketching books and I've never been disappointed with any of Jack Hamm's books. He provides more information in his books than a great many other authors and his work is really wonderful. In fact, he is the only author that I would purchase just because it was him. There have been some of his works that I was hesitant about, but as soon as I saw them I new I didn't need to be. Clear and concise."
5,Ideal way to start drawing,"I've always wanted to draw animals and this book has been worth it's weight in gold for me. It's a great ""starting to draw"" book and it's also something that an experienced artist can use. Inspiration everytime I open the pages!"
2,not a mirror for a Yukon with electric mirrors,"Yes it was a mirror but not any where the correct size or shape it was supposed to be, I can get by with it but it's not what it was supposed to be."
1,cheap,its cheap and the strips that came with it didnt not work rip-off save your money.we saw that they sale hole mirrors on here much better investment
1,I wouldn't buy this again,"I had bought a dozen cakes of suet on sale at Ace Hardware for a dollar each, and a holder. The birds in my backyard have been going through about a cake a day of suet, so I thought it would be a good idea to order a this case of 16 cakes. Although I did read the reviews that said this product is smaller than other brands (under 10 ounces compared to over 11 ounces), the price seemed good so I bought it. Unfortunately, the birds don't like it as much, the cakes are crumbly, and the size is a lot smaller. Then I found a case of 10 cakes of Morning Song Year Round suet at Menards, 11.75 ounces, on sale for $8.72 and put one out. The birds are going through a cake a day again. I will use up the rest of the Heath cakes, but won't buy that brand again."
2,Disappointed,"These suet cakes seemed like a good idea for value, but not only are they smaller than the Kaytee and Birdwatchers Best brands, but they are very greasy and melt while handling them at room (68 degrees) temperature. I've had to keep them in the freezer."
2,Birds don't like this,"I thought this would be great cuz birds liked other citrus cakes I'd put out, but it takes them almost a week to get through this. In contrast, they go through a peanut butter cake in half a day and fight for access."
3,amnesia: the james brighton enigma,"disappointing film. a lot in the description of the film by earlyreviewers, i just didn't see in the DVD release.i have learned that what is shown in the theatre is not what we thegeneral public get to see in the released DVD.if you get a chance RENT before you buy"
5,EXCELLENT film! Could watch it over and over!!!,"I don't know what the reviewer ""Gordon Larko"" is smoking. For some eason, he feels compelled to leave the EXACT SAME horrible review and 1 STAR rating for all GAY-THEMED movies. Probably a ""personal problem"" of his. Hopefully this review will help correct this imbalance. I can't believe AMAZON is allowing this GAY BASHER to use their website as a venue to spread his hate.By the way, This is an absolutely WONDERFUL movie!"
3,NOt that great!,"I watched this movie, with regret. I imagined it would be disappointing, and was right. It gave little to enjoy. The only good part about it was the ending. Perhaps not my cup of tea, the movie. But, all in all, I would not watch it a second time."
3,"Good Story, but Confusingly Told","I was hoping for an exciting film. It had the potential to be a very intriguing movie; however, in my opinion, the direction was scattered and not very well thought out. It was very difficult to follow the plot. The acting was good."
3,"Not perfect, but watchable",Made it to the end without too much effort. Haven't used it as a frisbee which is my benchmark for quality.
1,Dire Movie - Don't waste your money !,"Brutal Acting - Desparate Direction - Lighting drastic - Very Canadian - Dull, Found it hard to stay awake."
3,Fun but not Profound,"I found this an enjoyable, although not a profound read. It was a very light diversion which may have been improved with more character development, and therefore, a longer story about each character. While I will probably try some of the novels written by the individual authors, I won't try another collection of short stories, as in this book."
5,Great Read!,Pollack captures the humour and the frustration of a teenager with a new drivers license. Brilliant writing style.
4,"Very big, good purchase","This rug is huge! It is in my 2-year-old son's room. We have laminate floors, so it nice for an area to play on. I got this for my boys for Christmas 2009. I think it was a pretty good buy. I wouldn't have spent a fortune on a rug, but I wanted something that would work for our little Thomas take-along trains."
5,"Vroom, vroom!",This poor rug has taken such a beating. Between my potty training kid and the puppy it's been washed a handful of times. Don't do that unless it is absolutely necessary though because it kind of hurts the shape of the rug and the rubber backing starts to come off in big pieces. I'd buy it again in a heartbeat though because it's large without being obnoxious and it's got both roads and train tracks. My little one loves it!
4,Very cute and seems durable,"It's a vivid, brightly colored carpet with plenty of content to spur imagination. It's certainly not a soft, plush carpet, but should stand up to hard use and playtime...which is what we bought it for. When I walk across it with shoes on (or my dog walks across it), it is a little noisy due to the type of fabric, but I expect that will fade as it is used and it softens up."
1,HORRIBLE MATERIAL and PRODUCT,"Terrible product,it stains easily, and in the first wash it came apart though it says to wash with care and slow, it still tore and the bottom part dissolved into what looks like sand every time i lift it there's a ton of residue from the bottom portion that coming apart. if my child's shoe has Velcro and it happens to touch the carpet, it gets stuck and when removing it a large tare appears. I've wanted to throw away this carpet a number of times but my child loves the design which is the only thing that has saved it from the trash. i don't recommend anyone to buy this. its an expensive carpet that is not worth a penny."
4,Not a Bore at All!,"I am quite sure that Jeannine Deckers wished that her life was the ever cheery, whimsical life of the Flying Nun, but reality isn't always such a bang. I found the story very detailed, insightful and told me more about the real Singing Nun than any other source I have ever found. Music from the Soul is the only biography I found in English at all. If anything I can understand her lyrics more now that I know something of her life."
3,Understanding Benedict's relationship to the Master,"This is an important contribution to the studies of Saint Benedict because the book shows clearly what parts of the Rule are from Benedict's own hand. For a long time this information was available, but only for those who had the patience to work through the texts by themselves. With the manner of printing of this edition of the Rule, this material is very clear. For those of us who live under this Rule, this book is an important tool to further understanding the spirit of our founder."
4,"Nice album, but prefer B-side band One Eye Open. The Janitors screwed me over.","Well Janitors I have to admit you make some decent music but you totally screwed me when you didn't come to my charity show at UC Berkeley oh, I think in 1999. Neither did another headliner, who's name I forget. So I think you are lame on a personal level but respect your tasty-looking album on a musical one.Word.Steve Sharatz of the long defunct band once known as Ludicrous Speed. You must admit that Ludicrous Speed is a contender for the best name ever for a band, and that Janitors Against Apartheid sounds silly and haughty at the same time.But to the customers: It's a run of the mill ska album, to which I think the ""accompanying"" band One Eye Open contributes the most in terms of originality, musicianship, and fun."
2,Waste of money,"There are three stories included in this book. The first story is called ""swords of the red brotherhood"". If any of you have ever read the conan story The treasure of tranicos, then you have read this story, as it is nothing more than a change of setting and the names have been altered, the other two tales are not even worth mentioning. All in all a very poor read."
4,Cheap,"A very interesting book, filled with short stories from different cultural backgrounds. Also I got this book for $0.01 USA dollars were at my college it was at $79.99. Couldn't be happier!! :)"
5,We love our gator,A night does not go by that our 4 year old has not asked to ride his gator. He absolutely loves it. We liked the fact that it was a relatively gender neutral toy. For the price we are hopeing that our son's younger sister and brother will also be able to use it. He fills the dump bed and delivers the items all over the yard. I really like watching him figure out how to get out of situations. The only complaint I have is that it does not have seat belts. I think we will try to rig something up to keep his 2 year old sister safe while being the passenger. I think it is well worth the money.
3,Not Very Durable,"This item was all my 4yr old son wanted for Christmas last year. Santa was nice enough to pull threw. The only 2 faults I have is the reverse gear is very heard to get on, and the plastic wheels are very heard to deal with. I have a rock driveway and the wheels just go round and round till my son gets angry and just leaves it sitting until my husband or I lift it to the grass. For the price I thought it would be more durable......."
2,John Deere Gator,"We bought a John Deere Gator sept of 2002 and we have had problem after problem. First the windshield broke off after the first week and then the handles fell off , so we put it up for the winter , when we got it out this last spring, it worked for a while the it started to go really slow and the tires would spin out and it would not go anywhere, b/c the tires can not get any traction, we have to put a cinder block in the back. but know the gears in the back tires went out and it won't go anywhere,I would never buy another one."
2,john deere gator ride on,"after comparing this ride on with the power wheels trucks and jeeps,i found this one very unsafe.this one state ages 3-6 years old.first of all there were no seat belts,seats were very narrow,a 3 year old could fall out of the seat to easily and be run over by this 90 pound ride on because it did not have running boards to keep a child from going underneath the back wheels.the winsheld,tailgate seamed flimsy.i have a 3year old and i am going to buy the power wheels truck ,it has sides to help keep kids in while the vehickle is moving ,also it seems to be more durable and safer."
1,Stay away..... This is Junk!,I bought this for my son for his 5th birthday. I put it together like I have with all the other battery powered ride-ons we own. I noticed right away it was junk. Everything is plastic. When I finished I told him go easy with it because its not made very well and looks like it will break. Sure enough not even three weeks went by and the gears broke. It would not go in reverse. I took it back to the store and they replaced the broken gear. Almost a month later the gear broke again. Does not go in reverse. Fixed it again. We just took it out for spring May 2005 and guess what? Gear broke again. Only this time it will not go anywhere. My son is very careful with his toys. We have a jeep and a Quad that he has had since he was 3 yrs old and they both work just fine. The Gator is JUNK!! Do not buy it. I did purchase the protection plan and the store is working on what they can do for me. I would love to return it.
1,out of juice!!!!!!,"Have a wonder toy in my garage. Needs a battery. It has (four)4 wheels, seats one, has handles like a bike with the brake on the right handle. The wheels are 10"" ( Diam ) x 6"" (width ) and Lenght is 36"" or so. Pedal is on the right side resting on a flat guard ( which are in both sides). This car is about 3 to 4 years old. Please help me find a place where they have a battery. Thank you for your time.PS. This riding toy does NOT have a brand, name or company that has built it in the past. It's yellow, with blue seat and black wheels. Probably was bought at Toys ""R"" us. Thank you for your time"
2,VERY BAD BATTERY,I BOUGHT ONE IN THE BOX WHEN I GOT IT HOME IT HAD NO BATTERY OR CHARGER THE STORE SAID CALL THE COMPANY WHICH I DID THE SAID THEY WOULD SEND OUT A BATTERY/CHARGER 3 WEEKS LATER. NOW THE 12 VOLT BATTERY WILL NOT LAST MORE THEN 1 HOUR OF MY SON RIDING IT AROUND THE YARD. I WOULD CALL IT A POOR RIDE ON TOY TO BUY. POWER WHEELS HAS A JEEP THAT WILL RUN FOR 3 DAYS WITH NO RECHARGING IT IS UNBELIVEALBE THEY HAVE A VERY GOOD PRODUCT..
2,Reverse doesn't work,"Less than one month of having this toy, the reverse does not workwe are taking it back to walmart and exchanging it, since we still have the receipt and box.Also the toy does not work to well in grass, especially if grass is wet.SInce the battery is in the front, there is hardly any even distrubtion of weight, so it makes it hard to go up hill sometimes. I will not exchange for another gator, we are trading for something fisher price."
3,problem with gears in Gator,Santa brought this Gator for my 3 yr old son. He LOVED it expecially since his grandma has the matching full size Gator to do chores here on the ranch. I was very dissapointed when the reverse did'nt work after the second day. We brought it back to Wal-Mart & got my son another. The gears lasted 2 weeks this time. I was very disapointed because my son had so much fun using this to feed the horses & another vehicle just would NOT be the same. Im sorry that we chose this product. I wish I would have chosen the Jeep.
2,Gator - A Dissapointment,"As Christmas approaches, I thought I would give the counter argument to all of these wonderful reviews about the Gator. I received the gift for my two boys (aged 3 and 5 at the time)2 years ago. Initially the Gator was great. Apart from major traction issues (it is terrible with any type of moistrue on the grass), the guys loved it, and it worked well. After 3-4 months, it began to fail. The gear box started to slip. The windshield cracked clean off. The seat adjusters lost their screws. And a bunch of other stuff. It is a very fragile toy, and that needs to be taken into account for anyone purchasing this for good, hearty kids that like to have a good time, but can be extremely rough on toys. In general, I am a fan of Peg Perego, so that makes this even a greater dissapointment. At the price, I would look elsewhere."
2,Gator Review,"Very Attractive toy, instructions are tough to follow, took over an hour to assemble. I can't imagine that the toy will hold up. Seems pretty flimsy."
3,Gator,Battery does not last very long. Replaced 1 wheel motor in the first year. All 4 plastic tires replaced. Did use it a ton. Don't let the John Deere name fool you. Is a plastic $300 toy that does not last. Customer service is bad as well at Peg Perigo. They are the only one to service. Looking for parts now. Electric. Do not get wet. Has shorted out several times.
2,Bad product,"Totally disappointed with the gator.Identified with all the previous reviews(battery weak,gears defective, and shifter). Power wheels are of better quality and more durable."
1,John Deere Gator - Not nearly as durable as Power Wheels,"This product stinks! We bought one for our boys for Christmas and we have had nothing but problems with it since. Furthermore, the John Deere Gator does not even offer seat belts and the seats sit up higher and dont have any sides to hold a child in so they are a lot more dangerous than the Power Wheels products. We had a Power Wheels Jeep for our first son that lasted 7 years. Our Gator lasted 2 months and we retured it! Stick with the manufacturer (Power Wheels) that has more experience!"
2,Maybe I got the ONE bad one!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have read the reviews as I did before we purchased this Gator a year ago and I guess we just got a DUD! Everytime my child gets on hers, something else falls off. It is NOT DURABLE AT ALL!!! The plastic is nowhere as durable as the harder stuff you get on the Power Wheels ride ons. We have a Motorcycle, 2 Jeeps, a Corvette and a Gator and the Gator, by far, is the one of the least quality. I would not recommend this one to anyone. It's a shame to spend that kind of money on something only to have it falling apart as early as 6 months after we got it. It still looks brand new as far as color and wear but the parts are just not cutting it. It is an adorable ride-on that is for sure, but what good is looks if it's not of good quality? This is the first review I've written so didn't mean to get carried away but my recommendation is that if it's not Power Wheels brand, don't get it."
1,Do Not Buy the John Deere Gator Ride-on! ...,".... You cannot recharge the battery without having to dismantle the vehicle and my children would require it to be charged everyother day. So unless you have a lot of time on your hands I do not reccommend buying this vehicle. Also, the back drop gate is made very flimsey and after a couple of uses will not shut. I have another power Jeep and it can easily be recharged by opening the hood. This appears to be a design flaw!"
1,very dissapointed,"We purchased two gators for my sons for christmas. One of them ran about three weeks before the gears broke and it would only go in reverse. Then the next day, the other one did the same thing. Luckily it was within the stores 90 day return policy so they both went right back. We were very reluctant to buy a peg-perego product because we purchased a gaucho grande two years ago and have had nothing but problems with it (the gears). But we were assured that was the exception and not the rule(by peg-perego customer service and toys-r-us sales person) Well with problems with all three and the later two only within a month of use I hardly think it is a coincedence.Also peg-perego didn't want to fix the problem after the warranty period even though it was the same peice breaking (over and over) while it was under warranty. My best advice better to be safe than sorry....stay away from peg-perego."
2,Not exactly what you'd expect from John Deere,"My son loves the look of this vehicle. The idea of having an area in back to put stuff in is great. One problem, the weight is not distributed right, so if you go up hills, even small ones,which it says it will do, your tires spin. It needs to be filled with heavy rocks in order to work. Also, the quality is not what you'd expect from the name John Deere, not even an hour after we had it out, a screw came loose just from the normal jarring of driving around. If we had a choice again, we would not purchase this vehicle."
3,"""Santa"" Gift","""Santa"" brought this gator for Christmas 2004. It was wonderful at first. Now, 6 months later, the gears are stripped and the tires (even w/some extra help from my husband) are totally shot. I love the gator, as do my 5 & 3 years old, however, I am EXTREMELY disappointed that this is broken already. I bought a Power Wheels Jeep 2 years ago and that thing runs like a top! I will never buy another Peg Perego again. I will defintely stick to the Power Wheels brand. I am not sure it is even worth my time to contact the company. Buy this ride on at your own risk."
2,Looks good....not very durable,We chose the John Deere Gator because it sure looked better than the Power Wheels Jeep. We had the Gator 1 week and parts began to fall off and it quit working in 2nd speed. Not happy at all with this product. Should have gone with the Power Wheels. Big lesson learned.
2,replacement tires very expensive,"I bought this a year ago for my son. He absolutly loves it.However!!! Do not buy this unless you are prepared to replacethe tires frequently with normal street/driveway use. Peg Perego will replace the tires at no charge ONE time during the warranty period. After that, YOU PAY DEARLY. A set of fronttires with postage will run you $45, a set of four will run you $85. Unbelievable!!! I cannot comprehend how they cannot come up with a better tire design. The problem is that the front tires toe in and wear really fast on the inside of the tire eventually creating holes in the tires. The tread is gone in about two weeks. This will probably end up in a future garage sale and we will probably buy something else with solid tires."
3,Disappointed,"We bought this for my daughter one and a half years ago. She has fun driving it around our 43 acres. However, the reverse stopped working about 8 months of her riding it and the tires have lost the the tread, that she can't even ride it at all. I have been trying to find tires to purchase, but all I can find are new batteries. I would not buy another one of these for my daughter. Quite frankly, she is a little disappointed that ""Santa's"" present did not last very long and does not work like it is suppose too."
4,Customer service from Peg Perego,"Just called to get help putting the dump bed back down on my granddaughter's Gator she got for Christmas. When she came back from one of her many trips around our property, the dump bed was stuck in the up position. How refreshing to quickly reach a person who spoke English clearly and knew the product well. Tonya was willing to stay on the phone while I worked out the problem - a good 10 minutes. She explained how a certain piece should be installed correctly several times, listening to my questions and giving good replies until I ""got"" it. She was patient and nice. THANK YOU for good customer service!"
4,My kids loved it!,"Despite some reviews to the contrary, my kids (who are not real easy on their toys) have really enjoyed the Gator. We've had it almost three years, and it's still going strong. I highly recommend it!"
3,My son loves the toy when it works(rarely),"I purchase the gator for my son about a year ago. It has worked for about 4 months out of the year. I keep calling and they send me the parts, but for my son it is very discouraging. He isn't a rough kid and for this product to keep breaking is a little tough. My suggesting is get the Jeep product. My son was in the store with me and liked the look of this better, but I should have talked him out of it. Per-Perego makes good strollers but they have a lot to learn about the battery operated toys."
1,Rayford is the man,Rayford has to be one of the best drummers touring today. If you get a chance to see him perform it will be memorable. This cd is well put together and does not have a bad song on it. I hope he puts out another one soon.
1,what a great book!,this book was exactly what i've been looking for! i wish i had it when i started out as a video activist. you must buy this book if you are in anyway involved with campaigning!
4,Excellent - but it has inspired even better works,"This is an excellent book for learning Greek vocabulary and word formation, and has been used in seminaries for over 50 years. During that time, people have been thinking of ways they would add to it or improve it. Although Metzger's book still holds up quite well, I think that some of these newer books have surpassed it. For instance, I like Robinson's Mastering Greek Vocabulary better, and it contains much of the same material."
5,Classic -- must have,"If you're a serious (or even semi-serious) student of NT Greek, you'll want this book. A short list of vocabulary words, sorted and indexed several ways, gives you the information you need to start learning the most commonly used words immediately.Not designed to be read cover-to-cover, it's just a list of Greek words, their meanings and, often, related English words that derived from the Greek term. Using a computer program, the straight words could be generated easily enough, but the beauty is in the English definitions and related words. Designed to help make the connection between the English and the Greek clearer for the user, Metzger has provided students with an excellent, concise, and easy to use reference work that you'll return to over and over."
4,Must have Aid,This reference is an important resource for the first time Greek student. Organized in a fashion of word use frequency allows the student to locate the most commonly used words quickly. The appendices are extremely useful for understanding concepts such as the geometrical graph of prepositions.
5,Organization a key,"With the vocabulary ordered by use in the New Testament texts, this handy little book will have you reading and comprehending larger portions much faster than otherwise. It is a must have for any bilbical greek study. It is useful on its own as a reference, less useful as a single source tutorial, but absolutely essential for rapid study when combined with Machon or Mounce's works."
5,Bruce Metzger,This is really great - not a wonder that it has been a classic for so many years and is still so highly recommended.
3,"A great source book, but completely outdated ...","This really is a great book, I've bought it when I was just starting to learn about photographing cars and it really teaches you how to approach this niche in photography.The only problem is that it doesn't cover digital slr's, the author uses film and there is nothing wrong with that, but these days only a handful of people are still using film, most of us have switched to digital with great success I might add.The basics are the same, so you can still learn a lot from this book, but don't expect to learn about digital post processing or something like that, this book is about photographing cars in general, and his tips surely help to establish that."
1,Outdated,"Extremely basic and horribly outdated. I understand that some professionals may still use film, but I doubt many amateurs do. This book dedicates less than 200 words to Digital SLRs, and absolutely no mention at all of post-processing. Do yourself a favor and purchase the Jason Siu/Josh Mackey book instead:How to Digitally Photograph Cars"
2,This book is almost BIG Nothing!!!,"I thought I would learn ""anything"" about car photography when i bought this book, but actually it was zero added value to me. Only two ore three pages for Studio Car photography, with no much explanation. Elaborating more and more Car Outdoor Photography, but yet still with not much great information or professional details.It is only a basic introduction of what is Car Photography."
4,A Series Beginning,I loved this book. Susan Kirby has a talent for bringing you right into this enjoyable story. The characters are beautiful and believable. I finished this book wanting more and hurried out to find the other two in the series.
4,Good and Old-Fashioned,"This was a very entertaining Christian Fiction. I loved Libby, her father, and a few other characters. I loved the old-timey setting. However, the book was a bit drawn-out."
5,very seldom you hear such great female industrial talent,"this album is a different turn for them I thought, packed with good beats as usuall,but in this album you can really tell how open they are to every thing.you can tell they have a strong dedication to making our ears jump for joy everytime Maria sings.:)thanks once again."
3,beginning the social history of art,"T J Clark early in his career, exhibiting the thorough research, keen eye, and conversational yet erudite prose of his later work. Think of this as a warm up for The Painting of Modern Life. What I enjoy about Clark's writing is how he can be both cautious and bold in the same paragraph. This book will make you wish you had paid more attention in that modern european history class."
2,Not up to scratch,"I think that this book is not all its cracked up to be. All it tells you is about front page Express, 98. In front page it gives you all the intructions you need so why go buy a book that I persumed would give me information on HTML progaramming . Do not buy this book if you have any sense."
5,Cute calcium blocks for your hermies,"There are cheaper ways to provide calcium for your crabs, like parakeet cuttle bones, but I am more aesthetically inclined than frugal. My crabitat looks like a beach resort, so these calcium blocks look great in it. I put them in there only a few weeks ago, so I'm not sure if they are eating it, but they do love playing with them! The blocks are moved all over the place every day; sometimes I have to pull them out of the water pools. I would recommend them, b/c they provide entertainment for the hermies as well as a calcium source."
2,Not perfect...,"My crabs didnt eat them at all. They liked real food like fish and carrots. Just crush a sand dollar, starfish, or even a shell! Go spend your money on something like a new shell. Not recommended. Unless it's the only food there is in the cage[thats mean!] they wont eat it."
1,Bad product,"This board was wonderful until it was ~3 months old. After 3 months of use the board started to split. The board was never placed in the dishwasher, it never soaked. It was washed by hand and placed on the drying rack. I was very happy with it until it split."
4,"great size, reasonably sturdy","The first thing I had to do was clean this board very thoroughly, particularly the grooves around the edges where countless slivers were sticking out. Fortunately those came away easily with a soapy wet cloth. Those grooves are great to keep juices from running all over the place when carving. Carving itself is very easy because I have not only room for a large roast to sit, but plenty of space for the slices to fall away so I don't have to keep stopping to plate them. I used an electric carving knife, which unfortunately nicked the surface right away. I can't really expect a wood surface to withstand that onslaught, so I'm just careful now when getting to the bottom of each slice. I use a plastic cutting board when preparing raw meat, but for slicing and chopping this one is ideal. If you ever cook a holiday roast, I promise you will be glad you got the large board. If you just want something to chop vegetables on this one is definitely too big. I'm very happy with it."
2,Slippery,"I had high hopes for this cutting board, based on the positive ratings others have given it. However, I don't like it at all. One reason is, admittedly, personal. It has rounded ends rather than being a perfect rectangle. Consequently, pieces of food get between it and the stove, next to which I put my cutting board. But, more importantly, it is very slippery due to its smooth finish. My knife slips and I have problems using my chef's knife to pick up pieces of, e.g., chopped garlic. I'm sorry to have bought it."
4,so far so good!,"Thought I've only had it a few weeks, this board has proved sturdy and reliable thus far. The rubber feet prevent it from moving around, which allows me to use it over a corner of the counter (small NYC kitchen) by positioning the feet on either side and letting the board extend over the air between. Dries quickly and decent size."
4,Schom succinctly portrays the notables of Napoleonic France.,"I attacked One Hundred Days like Wellington attacked the French. Unlike a biography I read of Boney years ago, Schom marvelously and succinctly described the background and characters of a constellation of lesser notables who surrounded the Emperor. In doing so he made understandable the mood of France as Napoleon made his spectacular come back attempt before bowing out of European history. This book filled an enormous gap in my understanding of France as a European power and as a nation at the beginning of the 19th century. My daughter could hardly have made a better choice of gifts for my birthday."
1,Too technical for the average enthusiast,"No doubt this book is of great value to the professional, but to the enthusiast not trained in the field of odonatology this book is way too technical. I found myself reading and re-reading not a few portions of the text to try to understand the terminology, but even with descriptive drawings I found it unintelligible on many points. The only way to understand what Tillyard describes would be to have an expert demonstrate on a real life specimen. I gave it a three stars for its wealth of information, but only that because it left me shaking my head and wanting to put the book down every time I dove into it to attempt another go of it. It sits on my shelf and collects much dust. If I had been able to see and read some of it myself, I would never have purchased it."
5,great TV,"I bought a refurbished unit and am quite pleased. I put it on a far wall in my bedroom behind a door that is usually open during the day (I hate the look of TVs in a bedroom). It is invisible during the day, but is super clear and easy to watch from by bed 15 or so feet away. Very clear picture with fabulous color."
3,Old Age Spots Lightened,"I'm a 48 yo Asian Female with very delicate facial skin that has old age spots on my cheeks and tip of my nose. I used to use Nadinola and Porcelana when I was in my early 40's with good results (spots gone!).However,as I have become older, the spots are now much more resistant. I have tried the Exuvience Lightening gel, but didn't get any better results than the Nadinola or Porcelana. So I have now tried the Physicians Bleaching Cream 6%. I've only used this cream for about 1 month (4 weeks). My spots have faded but are not completely gone. They are easier to cover with a tinted moisturizer and a little loose powder. Always wear a good sunscreen when using this product or the effects will not remain. I will try this for another month or two to see if I continue to improve or not."
3,How To Cook Almost everything Vegetarian,"Having taken out this book from the library, I decided to purchase my own copy. The book I received was an abbreviated version of the one I'd borrowed."
5,Oh come now! Everything???,"Well, not quite everything, perhaps. But covers just about every category of food from soups and salads to sandwiches and treats. Basic ideas which can be extended with a little imagination to preparation of many dishes. Tickles the iomagination. And with only a little over 100 pages, it doesn't load you down with fifty milliion recipes you will never use."
2,Don't Confuse with Son House's great Original Delta Blues album,"The Original Delta Blues, which is far superior, is often confused for this album. This one does a poor job of showing what a special artist House was."
2,Sappy and cliched story of a female auctioneer,"I think this is one of those books that will appeal more to women than to men. It is the story of a forty-year-old New York auctioneer who seems to think an awful lot of herself. She has the usual romantic complications, including a banal liaison with a cliched Frenchman, whose ""secret,"" when we find out what it is, is pretty silly. This is not an offensive book; just not very interesting. There are some lines of dialogue here that will make you roll your eyes and groan."
2,Occasionally nice writing but weak plot,"There are some great passages in this book, and some interesting dialogue between the main characters. Unfortunately the plot doesn't hold up and the conclusion of the book is pretty unsatisfying."
3,Character Transformation: Did She or Did She Not?,"This book is what I call ""romance with substance."" I appreciate the strong female character (Amy), especially since she's older. She does seem a bit one-sided, but I think that was the author's intention: a woman whose self-worth is wrapped up in her career as an auctioneer. There are other characters I would have liked to get to know better. At times Butler went on and on describing artifacts and I found myself skipping ahead. That (and the many run-on sentences) distracted from the story line. The whole ""wealth"" thing isn't really a fascination for me, but the transformation of character IS (e.g., how Amy thinks of herself at the beginning of the book and at the end). The ending was a surprise - no ""happily ever after"" - and I liked that."
1,Should Be Donated To The Lowest Bidder,"Abominable. Stilted dialogue. Sketchy characters, except for the auctioneer herself, who is lame, pretentious, and not remotely likeable. With dueling lovers named ""Trevor"" and ""Alain,"" don't expect too much, hoss. Not to mention the cringing cliche of a fairy godfadder, Arthur. And the mean, Lear-like Daddy, provenance: Cormac McCarthy. And, of course, the ""M"" famiglia, Missy, Molly 'n' darlin' Maggie. A-and da perverted lute or luit, whatever. (Incidentally, this crummy novel either consciously or unconsciously rips off Paul Griner's vastly superior novel ""Collectors."" Read that one instead, hoss.)"
3,"Good, but not the best","Like its title suggests, this is a slow but challenging yoga practice that lets you go deep into some difficult poses. I always come out feeling deeply stretched and relaxed, but like many other reviewers I found some of Bryan's talking distracting. His reminders to stay with the breath are excellent, but some of his banter is too over the top, LA for my taste. A nice combination of poses, though, and I can see why he has such a devoted following."
3,Not my cup of tea,"I ordered this CD along with spinal strengthening. I liked the spinal cd better as they are VERY similar. This is a lot of forward bending and some poses that are bad for the knees. As a previous reviewer said, it WILL cook your hamstrings. Be forewarned, Bryan uses sexual imagery, such as ""crotch candy"" and crotch asana"" I found this offense at first, but I block him out. Ultimately, I returned this CD and kept the Spinal one."
3,I can't believe it's Radio Flyer!,"Some bean-counter figured out that they could cheap out on the wheels and get away with it. Every other big wheel wagon out there (for half the money) uses steel wheels with ball bearings on a 5/8"" diameter axle but what we have here is a cheap plastic wheel with no bearings on a skinny 1/2"" diameter axle. And instead of a drilled axle with washers and cotter pins they use those stupid pound on plastic caps, sure no fun for the poor soul who has to put it together. If you put one on slightly crooked, it will never stay on and then you have a fine three-wheeled wagon. How much fun is that? I'd advise anyone to not buy this wagon until Radio Flyer figures out we won't pay a hundred bucks for cheap plastic wheels."
4,how was i to know it was a bloody night?,"seriously, sublime, the independents, mealticket, a 'minor threat' cover.... where can you go wrong?"
3,"It's a good ska cd, if that's what you're into","""Misfits of Ska"" is likely the lowliest Asian Man Records release I've ever bought, but it's still adaquate. No severe language, and it's entertaining."
2,Just bad writing,"This book is very poorly written and badly organized. Essential introductory topics are sprinkled throughout the book seemingly randomly. Much of the writing is horribly ambiguous or just plain unreadable. I am a beginning programmer, though I am highly proficient with Excel. I was lucky to be familiar with some other programming languages because the explanations of object-oriented programming concepts in this book (as well as other topics covered) would have been completely incomprehensible without a moderate level of background experience. The examples in the book are neither practical, nor particularly well designed to illustrate the VBA concepts that the authors are trying to teach. Instead, the authors seem to be preoccupied with designing examples to convey stylistic programming conventions that they personally favor."
1,Yup it's bad alright,Just want to echo the negative reviews below. I've owned and read a lot of programming books in my life and this is one of the worst. Avoid it.
4,Excel 2003 VBA,"Excellent book giving an extremely thorough guide to the Excel 2003 Object Model, packed with directly applicable example VBA code."
2,Not the most durable quality,"I returned it, it was a little too expensive for something I could buy a lot cheaper. Bummer, cause I had to pay to ship it back."
4,A Contemporary take on Toeffler and Naisbitt,"This book is more the application of the theories expounded by Toeffler (Future Shock and Third Wave) and John Naisbitt (Megatrends) in the context of the Geo-political and Social happenings today. While the concepts are not necessarily new, the application is in depth and conclusions are well founded and statistically well supported. A good read for people in the fields of Science and Technology policy and Socio-psychology."
2,Writing from Readings,This was a required book for one of my classes. I found it not very helpful and very boreing. After reading the chapter I would still have to look up info on the internet for my assignment in order to get a good grade.
5,This book is really wonderful,I think that this book is really wonderful because it teaches us step by step how to analyze a text without falling in plagliarism and helps us understand the many sides of the text without avoiding anything.
5,Excellent Product,"I would say the product description was very detailed,The price was really reasonable,very fast response and the shipment was speedy,overall i would not go any where else,all my questions were answered in the product detail so i was hooked,most place you go will only give you parts of what your looking for and you have to wait long periods to get answered, but not this place, very pleasant to deal with, so i give an A++++++++ and will return for further business, THANK YOU"
1,"Save your money, dude","I have seen George and his band live and they were pretty darn entertaining, energetic, and danceable. However, this CD is none of these things. I have listened to Buddha Boogie once, but I don't think I will ever listen to it again. It's unmelodic, rambling and pointless and as a lindy hopper I was very disappointed by it. I can' get my money back on this stinker, but if I can dissuade some people from buying Buddha Boogie, maybe George will get the message and stop abusing his fans in this way."
1,"Save your money, dude","I have seen George and his band live before and they were pretty darn good, danceable and high energy. However, this CD is none of those things. I listened to it once. None of the songs are catchy, but rather are unmelodious, meandering garbage. I can't get my money back on this CD which I will never listen to again, but if I can dissuade even one person from buying this worthless slice of plastic, maybe George and his band will stop abusing his fans by putting out such unlistenable music."
2,BRAUN 8585,"Dear Sirs,I very much appreciate the opportunity you have provided for me to comment on my new Braun Electric Shaver.I am not a perpetual complainer. This is the first time in 40 years I have submitted a written complaint about a product which I have purchased.I must say , however, that I am keenly disappointed with my Braun 8585.It does not provide me with a clean or a close shave.Its performance is only very marginally better than my Norelco which has languished in my top drawer for more than 20 years.I am wondering whether the liquid cleaning ""device"" of the Braun is not just a gimmick--- messy, cumbersome and quite expensive to use.I sincerely apolgise for these negative comments but trust nevertheless that you will find them helpful.Respectfully submitted, Eric Sorensen, Minneapolis."
2,Not Close Enough,"This shaver cleans very easily, looks nice and keeps your sink clean. However, it just doesn't cut close enough for me, particularly on the throat area. I have never found an electric razor that even got anywhere near as close as a blade and this is no exception. I could get it pretty damn close on my face by repeatedly jamming the razor against my face, but it would take a long time to do this. As far as the hair on my throat, there was no way at all to cut that anywhere near as close as I would have wanted. This might be the best of the few electric shavers that I tried, but still disappointing."
2,Gift for husband gone bad,I bought this as a gift for my husband based on the great reviews. He was not pleased with the shave the product gave. He said that the razor did not give him a smooth shave on his neck area and it irritated the skin. I ended up returning it.
5,Another favorable review,"I'll try not to be redundant, as most of all the glowing feedback on display I agree with 100%. I'll add that I have the enviable honor of having sensitive skin, along with bullet proof stubble. It's always been difficult to shave every day because of my beard being pretty thick. Since a close shave irritated my skin with most razers, I would have to wait 2 - 3 days for a close and comfortable shave. More than likely it's the newfangled foil, but I can shave every day now if I choose and not have irritated skin, and/or a 12 o'clock shadow. The cleaning system is also handy for those of you lazy like me"
5,Great Shaver,"I got this shaver as a gift. It is the first electric shaver that I have used. The first few times that I used it, I felt the shave was not very close. But after a week, it is great. It seems to shave closer than with a razor. Also no cuts. The cleaner also works great, it needs cleaning only after 3 or 4 uses. The only problem I have is the noise. But maybe all electric shavers are a little noisy."
3,Not as close as I would like,"I have been using this razor for about a month now and I still need to go back to my normal razor. It just does not shave close enough. It's good if your traveling and need to shave quickly, but I do not see it replacing the standard razor.Jim"
5,he loves it,I got this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. It doesn't pull the hairs and can be used when ever where ever. The self cleaning is great. I haven't heard any complaints.
4,Awesome Shaver,"I finally bought a new Shaver after the battery on my 5400 died. This one is a great improvement. Alot quieter and easier to hold. My 5400 was narrow. I find the wider 8585 easier to handle. In my opinion, the 8585 shaves alot better than my 5400. I've read on other reviews that there is really no improvement, but I've noticed a great improvement. I also use my 8585 to shave my head and it does a much better job than my 5400 in that I dont have to swipe the same area several times. I only give 4 stars because of the price. I think they can come down another 50 dollars."
5,It's a good product,I bought this 8585 for my husband one month ago and he uses it everyday. It gives him a good shave and the cleaning system is convenient. He can always keep the shaver clean while not spending a lot of time cleaning it. Also Amazon emailed me the $50 certificate on time as promised.Thank you.
5,Smooth cheeks,"My husband switched to this after a Norelco rotary shaver. He says it gives him a better, closer shave. He usually got a lot of irritation with the rotary, but not with this one. The shaver holds its charge well and stays clean with the charger/cleaner system. He's had it almost two years and has had to replace the foil once. We buy cleaner liquid refills here on Amazon.-----Update 5/19/11The shaver still works great, no problems at all. EXCEPT if you have very good hearing like me, the charger makes a VERY high pitched sound constantly. It is not very loud. My husband can't hear it. However, I have to close the door to the bathroom so I can fall asleep at night. Most people probably wouldn't notice, but I thought I'd mention it."
4,Braun Rocks,"I love this shaver. I get a great shave quickly and comfortably. For my face, Braun has the best blade technology of anyone. I was very skeptical about the self-cleaning aspect and, in fact, it is the reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5. I like the idea but I don't like the cleaning fluid they provide. I have no idea what it is made of (smells like a petroleum product) and I'm not keen on the idea of putting anything on my skin that I wouldn't put inside my body. After all, our skin is our largest organ and it does absorb. I also don't like the idea of throwing those cleaning cartridges in a landfill over and over again. So, I've decided to create my own cleaning fluid using all natural, organic ingredients and just refill the original cartridge when needed. Overall, I am happy with the razor and highly recommend it."
1,Charger exploded,"I got this unit from Amazon in early July. I opened the box, connected the charger to a regular outlet. It just exploded after 2 minutes charging and left a big black mark on the outlet. I am returning it and don't expect any problem from Amazon. Anybody else had the same problem?"
1,Braun Shaver 8585,I bought this shaver less then 3 years ago and it just plain quit on me. Got hot during charging and motor wouldn't run at all. Took it to a recommended Braun repair person and he said the motor was burned out and not worth repairing. I paid over $150.00 for this junker and Braun gives no way to contact them on their WEB site. Have 2 much older (non-cleaning) Braun shavers and both work just fine. Repair person said this might have something to do with the wet cleaning used for this shaver....I wouldn't get another Braun like this if it was free.....
4,Closest shave my neighbors ever heard,"Let me start out by saying the Braun 8585 EASILY provides the best shave I've ever gotten from an electric razor. Though it's the slogan of another company, honestly the 8585 is the only shaver that's ever truly been ""as close as a blade"".Now for the reason(s) I've given it 4 stars rather than 5:The razor is loud, and by that I mean LOUD. It's loud when it's self cleaning, it's louder when it's held up to your face. The second reason, and this might just be me being picky, is the blue led at the base of the razor. The led is as bright as the razor is loud. I realize that the blue led's are new and high tech seeming, but seriously ... when the razor is in the cleaner / charger unit it also functions as a nightlight... a nightlight that bathes half the room in erie blue light.All in all though, the 8585 is an excellent product, LOUD but excellent."
5,Great shaver,"Pros:I can now use one shaver to cut long whiskers. I used to use a Braun for short whiskers and a Norelco for long whiskers that grew when I did not shave every day.The shaver does not pull the whiskers as they are cut, regardless of the length.I have used my shaver for six months and it still holds a good charge and cuts well due to the cleaner, I think.Cons:Cost of cleaner -- I use about one per month but it does seem to do what it claims. It keeps the shaver clean, lubricated, and smelling chemically clean.I would buy it again. Also, I would not waste money on the LCD display."
5,Excellent!,I have tried everything in the shaving world including giving a hot towel press before shave and all sorts of after shave to keep it cool. But this one has defeated all. This is the best product that I have ever had in my life. You get a very good close shave without harming the skin. Its just amazing
5,Awesome buy!,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my father in 2004 and it worked like a charm for 6 years without any problems at all! He loved it, and wants another one this year."
5,Very reliable,"I bought this for my boyfriend about 4 years ago, and it still works as if it was new, and it shaves very smoothly and comfortably. People should know, though, that it's an ongoing investment. He replaces the fluid cartridge about 5 times per year."
2,Self Cleaner Broke,"The shaver is fantastic, as most of the reviewers agree. However, after two months of gentle use, the cleaning stand stopped working. Braun is telling me to send it to a repair shop but, as luck would have it, I can't find my receipt so I can't get it repaired under warrantee. Even if I could find the receipt, I would have to send the stand in at my expense.I bought this shaver because I felt I would be buying quality. I am a product designer by profession and I feel that this product is not worth the money, especially in light of their repair policy. If they were to stand behind their products, I would be fine with this failure, but, as it stands, I regret buying this shaver and I doubt I will purchase anything else from Braun."
4,Travel pouch,Do not have a case or pouch for the shaver and the cord. Shaver has a case but not for the ord.
2,Missed too many hairs,"I really wanted to like this razor. Nice engineering, a clean comfortable shave, not too loud. Unfortunately, it just missed too many little hairs. I don't think my beard is any thicker than normal, but some of the hairs can curl under a little especially on my neck. Despite the nifty screen design, the razor just couldn't pick them all up no matter how many times I went over the darn things.Anyway, my advice: If you've had good luck with other electric razors and can afford the price tag, go ahead and buy it, you probably won't be disappointed. However, if you've had trouble with other electrics missing individual hairs, then you may want to stick with a blade."
2,Not good enough,I bought this shaver for my husband for Christmas as a luxury item because he hates shaving but it doesn't do a good job. I am not sure why it works for some people and not others but now I have a barely used shaver in my bathroom.I was very disappointed with the results or lack there of.
1,Wrong product,"Sent the entirely wrong product, could not send correct product so now I have wasted over two weeks for a refund."
1,Disapointed,"I found the shaver to be overated. After years of using a Norelco triple header, I thought of trying a Braun and found it to be difficult to achieve a good shave. The Norelco was far superior. I returned it to Braun, Amazon would not take it back because of the head cleaning fluid. Which is another expense, the cleaning fluid only lasts for about a month and needs to be replaced, even if not used, it evaporates. I would not recomend."
3,Braun 8585,Super product - does an excellent job. Is very convenient. Have been a blade shaver for years - but this really does a better job
1,"Braun Activator, a poor quality razor","Have owned a Braun Activator razor for less than 1 year, and have gone through 3 foils that have torn during normal use. You simply cannot replace just the foil, but you have to buy the entire shaving block along with the foil which gets expensive. During use, this razor did not give a close shave as advertised. I spent twice as much time shaving with the Braun than I did with my old Norelco just to get a half way decent shave. Nicks and cuts were commonplace which I found amazing with an electric shaver! I wish I would have never purchased this product.Lesson learned, I am running back to Norelco."
2,Poor shave after five months,"When I first bought this product, I liked the shave. Now five months later, it has degraded significantly. The blades are supposed to be replaced every 18 months, not every five. Turning the blades around helped some.Also, I don't like the fact that the cleaning fluid smells like artifical lemons."
3,Hit&Miss,"everybody that knows Me knows that I think the World of James Brown.the Man is a Walking Music Course&History all onto Himself.Arguably the Most Influential Cat in Music over the past 50 years.but His Work has been Hit&Miss for easily going on 25 Years&this Set continues in that vein.""Killing is Out,School is in"" reminds me of the Postive Energy&Uplift that Older JB Jams use to Bring.you get that vibe every now&then but overall not much is happening.but nevertheless whenever JB drops a Album I gotta give it a spin or two because He will always Command My Ears though Albums like this&others over the past couple of Decades don't hold my attention like His Older Albums did but still gotta give the ""Godfather"" a Roll Call."
2,Dialed In,"His last regular album, and his least. Uninspired writing and production.James (who I've dug forever) should have quit after ""Take a Look at Those Cakes"", but his legacy will always outshine his latter years. Or most anyone else's. ...bIGhIG"
1,James Brown,"This cd sounds nothing like the true style and down home, groovy,funk of James Brown. Hip Hop music is not his style. Killing is out School is in, is about the best cut on the cd. His band which is the best in all the land is not heard or reconized. I recently attended his New Years Eve concert in Atlantic City, NJ Trump Marina, He turned the house out! Performed from 10:30 pm until 1:50 am. The Soul Brother is Truly The Hardest Working Man In Show Business (even at 69 years young)"
4,Excellent toy for the money,"I bought this for my son's 2nd birthday, since he is a construction truck fanatic. After reading the other reviews, I was prepared for the minor tweaking that this toy required (ie, taking apart the locking mechanism, which is VERY EASY if you follow the other reviewer's advice). This is a definite must, as my son was frustrated immediately with the toy as the manufacturer made it. BUT after the locking mechanism was removed this toy is incredible and he plays with it in the sandbox all the time. It is BY FAR his favorite toy and has held up to the wear and tear of the sand pretty well. Great buy and one very cool toy."
5,Great for a little boy,This toy is great for little boys or girls who love equipment. I got this item for my son 2 nd birthday gift and he just loves it. It is a tiny tractor and it is just like his grandpa's tractor so which makes him a very happy little boy. THIS IS A GREAT ITEM.
2,Junior Excavator Ride-On,"I bought this toy from my son for his 2nd birthday less than a week ago. It is designed for the sandbox, but has already stopped working because sand has gotten into all the sliding parts. It also has a locking mechanism that is too difficult for even my almost 4 year old to figure out. But my kids love to ride around on it, it's just too bad the rest of it is so poorly designed."
4,Cool Toy,"My son received this for this 2nd birthday. He loves it! It is run to sit on and ride it on the floors. It does make cool sounds. It is good practice to work the bucket. I am sure it will get a lot of use. Good value for the money. His older brother, who is 6, also thinks it is fun. Easy to assemble."
5,Pleased with this Toy,"I purchased this toy for my 3 year old Nephew that lives across the US from me. My brother told me my Nephew loved the toy, it was his favorite birthday gift. My nephew is tall for his age & this toy fit him perfectly. He figured out the locking mechanism very quickly & has not had any problems with it. The toy is very durable, as a matter of fact my Nephew rode down a very large hill on it (on accident). It did not break or even tip over, it kept him completely safe. I highly recommed this toy, His sisters ages 10 months & 5 years old also love it & play on it when allowed. He has become the hit on his block"
1,ENGLISH SUBTITLED,"When i purchased this dvd, didnt notice it had english subtitles. Dont like that type of film, thats why i gave it one star, for somebody who dosent mind reading that stuff, it maybe a good movie. I gave this dvd to a friend."
1,"Very disappointing, irritating movie.","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, and I tried to like it, but it's just awful. Maybe I just don't get German humor, but to me this was a frenetic 96-minute barrage of (almost) universally unbelievable, completely obnoxious, cartoonish characters, stupider ""comic"" situations than you'd ever see on even the very worst TV sit-com, and ridiculous, extremely heavy-handed slapstick. The only even slightly redeeming feature is Florian Bartholomäi in the lead role as Karsten. He's cute, sweet and charming, and he comes light years closer than anybody else to acting something like a real human being. I can't believe he'd ever have looked twice at a shallow jerk like Steven if he hadn't been the first man who ever paid attention to him. I'd like very much to see Bartholomäi in a good movie, but unfortunately this is not it. This is a real lemon."
1,get real!,"I can honestly say that Twenty-Seven Props is one of the worst books, poetry or otherwise that I have read in a long time. What a complete mess, and how baffling that this book even found a publisher."
1,Fraud at its finest,"The speakers in these poems are most often tortured narcissists, and that does not compelling reading make. These might have worked as short stories but they are not great poems or even good poems. They are ambitious but ultimately dull and repetitive, striking the same hyperbolic notes over and over. Life's too short, so do yourself a big favor and skip this book."
1,Not recommended,"This book is campy and nonsensical, and a mess. The poet seems to be in love with the sound of his own poetic voice. This has to be one of the worst and most pretentious poetry collections to come out in at least the past year. If this poet is meant to be one of the most important emerging poets, as the back cover and introduction hype suggests, then poetry is in big trouble."
5,at home in the sublime,"this must be the most exhilirating first collection to appear in the last ten years. on every page there's sound and sense in abundance, words and rhythms that soar, plunge, effervesce like warm waves of feeling. donnelly's own way with the language holds the book togehter but the wide range of themes and subjects make it hard to say exactly what the whole book is ""about"" unless ""life and how it is to be in it"" still counts. and it probably should. because this book is full of delight at a time when i need that. at times the book's power is almost overwhelming so i recommend you read it slowly if you aren't at home in the sublime and read it repeatedly if you want to be."
1,"Navel-gazing dreck and hysteria, not for the serious reader","I could hardly get through this book in its entirety, so I quit trying. The poems in this book all seem to have been written by a poet with a tin ear, with no regard for nuance or understatement. He hits the same notes repeatedly and uses the exact same style in every poem in the book, and seems desperate to be clever in a really transparent way. But it doesn't work. There is no variety of concerns, and a notable lack of elegance or even real meaning. This is apparently the product of an arrogant but misguided poet striving to be ambitious and different, but what we really have here is more of the status quo, rendered in a syrupy style that is sickening after a while. Maybe this is the stuff that sells. Some may fall for this kind of verse but it's not what true poetry is all about, and any serious reader will recognize that fact."
1,"yep, nothin' but folderol...............","a first collection that's Ugly in just about every sense, starting with its oddball cartoonish cover; Moments grab you but are quickly lost, in a maddening vortex of an unappealing voice and style that make you recoil at nearly every turn. Which is about par for the course in contemporary poetry, so it's possible that this one maybe ranks somewhere around average in the big grand poetry picture-scheme of things."
1,Don't Bother!!!...,A friend recommended this book to me. I won't be taking recommendations from that friend again. Twenty Seven Props is overwrought and tedious.
5,Hoooooeey!!!,"This book is pushin' buttons! And it kicks ... too. I'm not 52 or even half that but I'd still like to categorize myself as a ""serious reader"" if I may & from where I'm sitting this book is the real deal. 27 Props = the most happening & eye-opening poetry collection I've read in a pathetically long time, kids. When you read it you end up reading it out loud. Or you want to be writing & to me that's the sign of something real. I guess it must be a good sign too that people seem to love it or hate it. But I don't know what kind of dud could hate the likes of Sonata Ex Machina or From a Further Meaning Faded or The Driver of the Car is Unconscious or the first poem or even the last poem, take your pick. My roommate says that if you can't handle it then it you probably don't deserve it in the first place. That's what I'm saying."
1,A JEJUNE BOOK YOU CAN SKIP,"After reading this collection, I wondered what made this poet tick, and, why would anyone care about what he is writing about. While I don't spend much time with Modern poetry, I didn't find the book challenging, difficult, edgy or clever. To this reader's mind, it is insubstantial and aimless, a display of ambition and dabbling in experimental verse, with no climactic payoff or deep meaning. So as not to make it a total waste of money, I gave away my copy to a co-worker, who flipped through and returned it right back to me. There are many ways to describe this book, but I would have to say that ""worth while"" isn't one of them, unless anyone would want to spend som time wading through this circumlocutory swamp."
1,Head to the recycling bin with this one,"Clunkiness abounds in this debut collection, which is about as deep as a dinner plate, and as memorable. Looking for some good emerging poets to add to your repertoire? There are lots of choices out there in poetryland, if you want great experimental verse that is bold and risk taking and changes your notion of what poetry is all about. This poet uses phrases that are downright embarrassing, so much so that you will find yourself suppresing giggles, and his so-called poetic language is contrived and strained for, not clever. While some powerful moments occur, they are outnumbered by moments of shrillness. I kept thinking of the loud, insistent wail of an infant as I read this."
1,This isn't poetry by any stretch,"27 Props is a clumsy book that gets on your nerves after spending time with more than a few poems, as the best are in the beginning. It is a cacaphonous collection that contains too many rambling poems, lacking in music and rhythm. What rhythm there is was strained for in an obvious way, that seems contrived and self conscious. Although I like challenging poets, and Wallace Stevens is my favorite, I look for talent, depth, and mystery behind the complexity to derive a satisfying read. 27 Props comes up short, though is probably about average in what you find in today's poetry. NOT RECOMMENDED by this reader."
1,puhleez and no thanx,"someone could use a volume control knob. it's a loud wail of hysteria that adds up to a mish-mosh of verse. allright to experiment, but you need some strong ideas and knowledge behind ya. pass this up and go check out the old timers. what we got here is yet another bad case of the emeperor's new clothes."
1,"a little bit to like, a lot to dislike","What I liked in Twenty Seven Props for a Production of Eine Lebenszeit is the sometimes laugh-out-loud humor. That's about it. Irony is hardly an original device, and it happens to be an overused device. Also, it has been done much better by far more gifted poetic masters, young and old, so the humor/irony aspect can only go so far here. On a scale of one to ten, this one deserves a low score because it doesn't offer anything beyond some cleverness and the aforementioned irony."
5,Review Issues,"It is not meant to be ""experimental poetry"" These poems contain infinite depth of content and intent. As for being ""pretentious"" and ""indecipherable -- not true, though the book does make a intellectual demands from its reader. For those who complain that the book is melodramatic and shrill, do yourself a favor and investigate irony's underbelly before passing judgement on 27 Props. Develope a proactive way of reading poetry. For the reader willing to invest time and effort, this book will blow your mind. For the reader looking for an easily accessable/formulaic/intro to poetry/roses are red, violets are blue kind of read, this is not the book for you. However, if you enjoy a challenging, rewarding, imaginative and thought-provoking read -- and, for that matter, you do actually know how to read -- you will love this book. The language is gorgeous. The book is brilliant. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
2,not what the doctor ordered,"i tried to get inside these poems, but the immaturity and shallowness didn't prove satisfying. the book notes that the poet is a student and it shows. while the vision is cohesive it is not interesting, and maybe better worked out in therapy than on the page."
1,not bad and not very good,"just pretentious is the best way to describe this book. A first book so the lapses are forgivable, but embarassingly melo-dramatic and pretentious with a capital P."
1,Better Unread Than Read...No Doubt About It,"To quote Dr. Samuel Johnson, ""He was dull in a new way and that made many people think him great,"" would sum up my opinion of this book of poetry. Don't believe the hype is another one."
2,A disappointment,"I guess I was hoping for that ""magic pill"" that would get me jump-started on my weight loss. This product wasn't it. No noticeable weight loss, minimal boost of metabolism and energy. I'm on my second bottle and despite taking the product as directed, I'm not sure I'll reorder. It just doesn't seem worth it."
2,price is not right,The little swimmers work just fine but this price is NOT a good price - I found the diapers much cheaper at the store!
4,Good for big jobs,"I used this shovel when I had to repair my fence and 11 fence posts.The long handle made it a lot easier to dig down but keep your back more straight and avoid fatigue. When you have a big job to do, you do not want a shove that has a base too large because the weight of the dirt held can be back breaking so it is a good shovel that is sharp enough to cut through the dirt with relative ease."
5,Best quality shovel I have ever came across,"I think I said it in my title, but I don't believe you will be disappointed in the shovel. Just realize if you don't really dig, you don't really need to pay for a shovel this nice. I picked this one up for $29 and couldn't be happier."
4,Only steel-handled long digging shovel out there,"On my 4th one of these in about 8 years. As one reviewer notes, they're not pry bars. I used them that way on tough roots and after a while predictably they cracked at a weak spot where the blade welds to the handle. Lowes replaced them no problem, but of course Lowes doesn't carry this shovel anymore. So it goes. But with the steel handle and sharpened blade this dude will work and work and work. If you can find it locally at Sears or HD you'd probably be better off, but regardless this is one bad-axe digger. Could probably shove it under a tire of a Smart car and use it as a jack!"
4,heavy duty,"Strong, solid, steel....I have had mine for several years and bought one for my son. Very serviceable and has held up wonderfully. No worries about breaking the handle; extra wide at the top of the shovel for using your feet. I did not rate it 5 stars because the orange vinyl/plastic end cap's top has torn."
2,Disappointed,"First, i want to say this is first time I've written a negative review on Amazon. I'm very disapponted with this order. I wanted to call Amazon but couldn't locate a phone number. I ordered a fiskars shovel based on product reputation. The description states its 100% steel and the picture has the name fiskars on the handle. I received the shovel promptly;however, the product is not as described. The name Fiskars is not on the handle it's Bully Tools and it's fiberglass not steel. This is not what I ordered. This is total misreputation."
1,Not what I expected from Fiskars,We have other Fiskars products...mostly scissors and loppers etc. Figured the shovel would be just as good. Not so!! We were digging out small roots and the handle just bent way back. Now it's only good for scooping up dog poop. Guarantee? Sure. But who saved the receipt? Now we're stuck.
3,Packaged Poorly,"The shovel was in perfect condition, however packaged poorly. I needed to return the shovel because my Husband already owned it. I was unable to due to the packaging cardboard being non-reusable. It was as if one large piece of cardboard was folded in half and glued over the shovel. You have no idea how hard it is to find a box big enough to hold one. Forced to keep it."
5,Best Shovel I've Owned,"Now this is one heck of a shovel. It's all metal, which is a rarity these days for any tool, much less for one less than $100. The shovel head is of good size and has textured step mounts to help ensure your feet won't slip while digging, something very important for digging in mud and if you're like me and wear sandals to do yard work. This shovel is made so well I was able to use it partially as a lever while digging up 18 bushes which had extensive root systems grown over 30 years. My other brand new wooden handle shovel cracked on the second bush. This one didn't bed and made the back-breaking work easier.I highly recommend this shovel for the quality and the incredible low price."
4,A tank!,"This shovel is definitely not a toy. It's big and it's heavy, but it's strong and looks like it will last many years. I've used it for normal gardening and landscaping. It's got a curve and a point so it's not great for edging, but it will turn up clay and move plenty of dirt. The shaft is shaped like a teardrop so it's comfortable, but I'm a tall guy and I'm not sure how it will fit in smaller hands."
4,Heavy Duty,"This shovel looks like it will hold up very well. The only problem is that it is very heavy. It's hard to use for situations where you have to lift it up very high. But for digging, this shovel works great!"
5,Nice!,"You won't be disappointed if you are fan of Anime! I recieved this one in about 10 days! If you are looking for inexpensive prices this is the place to come too. What I like is the reviews that I don't get from other vendors. That's what keep me coming back. Yes, sometimes it may cost more but you make it up in support! This Amine is not filled with all the fluff and fanfare. It's entertaining! It is for older youth not for kids!"
4,Anime review,This is basically an romance anime with some sad drama. I can recommend this to any anime fan who likes love triangles and stories with sad tragic events.
3,Rumbling Hearts,This anime was okay. I mean aside from everything being pretty much predictable it had it's moments.
2,Boring series that lacked almost everything.,"I just bought this box set and WOW, was I dissapointed. I don't know what others are talking about when they say this anime series is GREAT because it's not and here's why:The BAD:The English voice over was horrible. The characters had little to no personality. The *atmosphere was boring/everything took place in the same three areas. If you are someone who likes there to be more to an anime series then just a storyline, then this series is DEF. not for you. And the COMEDY parts (which dragged on in each episode) were ridiculous/not funny at all. This made the series confusing because there were ""comical"" parts and then dramatic/serious parts and both didn't go well together (in THIS series). I didn't even connect at all to the ""emotional"" parts, and that is rare for me.The GOOD:The main theme song is nice."
1,"""What a disappointment""","My father bought this DVD and said that it is 75% commentary and critical review and only 25% music.While the person was talking, the music was playing in the background but you can hardly hear it.He really wanted to hear music and see a performance but got too much talking. He's not a new fan of Abba. He owns four other DVDs and some CDs and he enjoys all of them.For a DVD at this price, it isn't worth it."
1,there is simply no point to this film.,"Well I am certainly a huge fan of ABBA and even more so I was in Australia in the 70s and I was right in the middle of abbamania downunder and there was so much television footage shot on the band both in 1976 and in 1977 for the tour and movie of course, there is no footage used here from the Australian visits at all and there is much footage that should have been included. This piece of tripe seems to me to just be a complete waste of time and even the hard core fan (me being one of them ) would be bored, I kept thinking, what is the point of this film, its just ranting for ranting sake. My advice dont bother."
1,Waste,"If there was a zero star review rating, this DVD would deserve it. I bought this because I wanted to see the ""Dick Cavett Meets ABBA"" videos. First, none of the videos are shown in their entirity. But worst of all is the quality: it appears to be about a 3 off copy. It is so bad that it can't be shown in full screen, but rather in inset box that is supposed to be a television screen. What a waste of time and money!"
3,3 or 4: I DUN'T KNOE!,I can see what some people find good in this band but to me it sounds like they can't decide if they're in Blink 182 or Sepelutura and it just gets annoying sometimes.
5,Jolson Fans Will Love This One!,"Clive Baldwin's voice and style are remarkably similar to that of the great Al Jolson. In this CD, Baldwin belts out Jolson tune after Jolson tune, all in digital stereo. The selections span songs Jolson made famous during the 1920's (""Where Did Robinson Crusoe Go With Friday on Saturday Night"") to songs Jolson made famous in both the 20's and 40's (April Showers), to exclusive 40's hits (Piano Roll Blues). At times, Baldwin's voice is virtually indistinguishable from Jolie's; and even when there is a difference, they are still close! If you love Jolson, you'll love this CD."
3,Poor construction?,"We bought this set for our two year old granddaughters. They had the set one month, when one of the pans was dropped on the floor (not thrown, simply dropped) and one of the welded handles broke off one of the pans. I am very disappointed. The set has not been abuse or mistreated and should have held up much better."
2,Get stainless steel instead,"This is a beautiful but fragile set. Like others said, when dropped the enamel chips and the chips are jagged and dangerous for small ones. When the handle snapped off of the pot it left this knife-like jagged edge - I was horrified! My 9-month-old was standing next to my 3-year-old as she held it. I tossed the entire set and am searching for a ss set."
2,"For St. John, it's not great ... not even very good.","I'm only going to St. Joh, and thought this would cover everything I needed. But there's very little qualitative judgements as to the quality of any of the lodging options, which don't help in deciding where to stay. Didn't prepare me for the 1 week minimum in almost all the rental villas. If this is your only resource for st. john, there has to be a better option."
3,Pretty plain,"This is MTV rock. This is also my first album. It's really boring the second or third time you listen to it, and I urge you not to buy this."
5,Best rock cd I ever listened to,When I first listened to this cd I thought ok it is pretty good. Then I started to listen to Fat lip and I thought these guys are good. If you liked Blink 182 you will definetly like this cd. My favorite song on this cd is Crazy Amanda Bunkface.
2,Bad,"You would think that I would like this cd becuase I skateboard and am into New Found Glory and bands like that, but I don't. This cd is horrible. It is really bad and none of the songs are punk at all, not even punk pop, just pop. It got two stars from me because of a really awesome song, and that is Never Wake Up. I had high hopes for them, but stick to NFG or any band on the Punk-O-Rama cd's."
5,Pure Alt-Punk at it's Best,"Whoa! Canada hasn't put out anything this good since hockey started up. Sum 41 is an awesome punk band who will definitely rock your house with this cd. From the Beastie-Boy-ism of ""Fat Lip"" and the Iron Maiden spoof of ""Pain for Pleasure"" this cd is just so cool I can't stop listening to it."
5,Sum 41 Rocks,"Sum 41 ROCKS!!!. This Cd is hella good. It has many songs that are hits and sound good. Fat Lip, In too deep, Motivation, Summer, and all the rest. The songs have a good beat to them and all the lyrics too them are good to, Fat Lip, and In too deep are two of my favorite songs. You should really get this cd if you want good music."
2,Sum 41 is not Punk...It's JUNK,"The only reason why I gave this bad CD 2 stars is because Sum 41 play their own instruments, so I give them that much. The lyrics are so bad, espically in ""Fat Lip"" where is says that he doesn't want to become a victim of conformity, when the ""Fat Lip"" video (which is horrendus) plays on MTV, so the singer is a hyprocrite. If you are looking for a good punk band, try listening to New Found Glory, Godsmack, Alien Ant Farm, or even Blink 182's old school stuff. Just don't listen to All Junk...No Punk."
1,"All pain, no pleasure!","That my friends is the truth about this album and how bad it is. Sure the Sum farty one guys are pretty funny (well except cone head or whatever the hell is name is) but they can't play music very well. Sure the guitarist will have the occasional solo now and then but it still does not change the fact that the music isn't good, the lyrics are stupid and a lot of their songs from Half Hour of Power sound exactly the same as some of the songs on this! Real creative boys!Now the fun (or painfull) part:Derek (frontman) He isn't good at being a frontman and pokes at his head to muchLead Guitarist dude (he isn't a very good guitarist dude)Cone Face: he isn't a good bassistStevo: while funny hes not the gretest drummer!PS: PFFFF"
5,Awesome!!!!!!,"I absolutely love this CD!! There are few CDs I can turn on and listen to all the way through w/ out skipping a song. This CD gets you so energized and the music is awesome! The only reason I bought this CD is because a good friend recomended it to me, so i thought, what the heck. It's so awesome!! Go buy it! I love Sum 41!"
5,Sum 41 All Killer No Filler,"Anyone who is a punk fan should have this CD, a lot of people say they sound like Blink 182 but they don't. IF you like Blink 182, you'll like Sum 41, but they don't sound like them. They have their own sound and it rocks. The song that got me hooked was Fat Lip, if I were to compare it to something for you, I'd say it sounds like a great cross between the Beastie Boys and Blink-182. Thats the only song on the album with that rock/rap flavor though. The rest of the songs are great punk songs that you won't get sick of. I listen to music every morning and for the last month or so, this has been n my CD player nonstop. Yeah, so anyways, you really should get this CD."
4,A fresh step on well run ground.,This CD is well done with original lyrics. If you like Blink 182 then Sum 41 will be another of your faves. The music is quickpaced and very pop-rock. The lyrics are well written and easy to get into. I love this CD almost as much as my Blink 182 CDs. I could listen to them all day.
4,Beastie-Weezer-Day,"These guys are amazing! From the tongue-in-cheek Death Metal jams to start and finish the album (a la THUD), to the Beastie Boys-esque single 'Fat Lip', this album rocks all the way through. Pure Chords make for good songs, but aren't so simplistic that you're going to smash your stereo after the 3rd listen. Excellent Disc, Wicked Band!"
1,Oh No!,"I had to listen to this whole album over and over in a car once. Let me tell you how my brain felt: SLUSH. I seriously don't know why Sum 41 is so popular today. The lyrics are stupid and IT'S NOT PUNK. When people my age ask me today why I don't like Sum 41 I reply: ""Because they're punk posers and do pop."" And their faces are so confused. It's because most people don't know what real punk is. Today the only ""punk"" music are posers like Sum 41 and Blink 182 that actually make pop music. When you think about it, there aren't even many BANDS today that you can consider ROCK. Music is at a low right now because of these kind of bands. Please- don't buy this album. You won't get anything from it. The lyrics are repetitive and stupid. The music isn't anything special. Do yourself a favor and don't listen to it."
4,Some Good Quality Punk,"Sum 41 first caught my attention with ""Makes No Difference"" off their older album Half Hour of Power....they sounded like a blink 182 rip off....even though the two bands sound remarkably similar, i still really like both because they are not ripoffs off one another...they sound similar but are still different and have their own musical qualitiesthe lyrics throughout the album are imaginative and catchy, and the guitar/bass parts are excellentthe drumming, unfortunately is too much like the prototype punk band...the drumming of blink 182 sets it apart as a better band, since everything else is nearly equal (though blink edges sum in every area, though not by much) travis barker of blink is original with his drum parts, and its too bad that stevo 32 of sum isnt...still, this album is a good album, with nothing on my back, fata lip, and in too deep being among the best tracks...also worth a look are tracks 5,6 and 8"
2,.....,"Although I realize that track 1 and Pain for Pleasure and meant to be jokes, unfortunately they come across as the best parts of the album. Sum 41 do a pretty good spinal tap impression and for that they get two stars. the rest of the watered down pop psuedo punk tracks are annoying, repetitious and lack in style, substance, and originality. But hey, atleast its consistent with the rest of the current bands out there, from britney spears to blink 182. its a sad sad time for music. :("
1,Sum 41 is the worst band ever!,"Sum 41 is the worst band ever! How could you people even consider them a punk band? They are more like pop music. They try to rap in ""fat lip"" but they just (are bad) at it. This CD is a piece of trash. My friend bought this CD and now he uses it as a doorstop. They are just a bunch of punk wannabe's and they will always appeal to girls because they are pop. If you want real punk music, listen to Rancid, Pennywise, or Green day. These bands have some real talent, while Sum 41 are just one hit wonders! Don't be stupid and buy ""All killer,no filler"""
1,"Let's make it a late night, a Wendy's late night!","I hate this band, it reminds me of that irritating Wendy's commercial. I love Wendy's, but I hate that commercial! Pop punk is way too happy and bouncy, I like my music to be dark and rainy. If you like sunny days, buy this, but I'll take a rainy day any day!"
1,Dumb Canadians,"I had the cd for about a week, then i burned it with a lighter. It was cool. most of the songs sound the same. This cd has been done so many times. All they do is play three chords really fast and tell everyone that they don't care about the world and that they WANNA be punks. this isn't even punk! Fat lip sounds like something Limp Bizkit would play. If you wanna hear punk then go get Rancid. these guys are a bunch of sellouts!"
1,Sum 41 is plague upon all music.......,"This album wouldn't irritate quite as much as it does now if it didn't seem like everybody but me enjoyes it. Not only are they unoriginal, the lyrics and versitality have reached an all time low. Sum 41 sings to pleasant pop tunes that they like making fun of people, they don't want to wake up, they have no motivation, and they are mad at their parents for making them do homework.This is good music for all the early teenagers who are in ""rebellion"" against their parents...Furthermore this album is about 40 minutes long.....all the songs sound the same and the longest song is 3:02 minutes and there is nary a guitar solo in the entire Cd. Oh Well....I'm sure that they will fade into obscurity within the decade.Anyways...I'm not a complete pop-punk hater...the self titled Blink 182 album wasn't that bad."
1,feh,"formulaic inane drivel, yet another step in the wrong direction for the music world. i hear groups like this on ""rock shows"" on mtv or the radio. this is as far from rock as you can get without being celine dion. its punk. its not even good punk like punk used to be. its bad punk/rap that pains me to hear so very very many groups doing the same thing. its apparently the only thing that people can register as rock. if you want hard, go listen to some system of a down. they can actually write music as well, as opposed to this garbage. im moving to sweden, they still play music."
2,getting old,"I think this young group is not reaching their full potential. I believe that they really whish to play 80's metal type music, however they are being held down to play the market-safe ""california punk"". Hey PunkRawkKing, you claim to be a punker, well it is spelled ""RAMONES""... That's all for now"
4,Sum 41 rocks!,"A lot of the other reviews say how sum 41 is just a bunch of posers (which i disagree with) but even if they are, SO WHAT? There songs are awesome, i mean, fat lip is a classic. They have played it at our school dance every time for 2 years! I also loved IN too deep, and Motivation. So everyone who says blah blah blah they're all posers- JUST SHUT UP! PLEEZE!"
2,TOO F ING POP!,"ok, i really liked half hour of power, and this cd is good, but it's more pop than punk, more zebrahead that the old sum 41. it's still ok though,"
5,Excelent Stuff!!,This CD is amazing!! I love it!! Every song on it is really really well in tune and lyrically masterminded!if you are a fan of punk/pop/rock.. u wont be dissapointed with this cd...this CD is money well spent!! I give it 10/10!!
3,Great Album,"This album is awesome and I have no complaints other then the fact that it's less that 30 minutes long. Come on SUM, write a few more songs next time, and make em longer!"
4,This is madd cool.,"O.K. for all you ""hardcore"" punkers, the Misfits and all them are more Gothic then punk. If you listen to the older punk (The Sex Pistols, The Ramones etc.) they sound like this. Oh sure try calling me a poser, to bad none of you know what a poser is. Anyway you should buy this album if you like good music. FYI: pop people DON'T play their own instruments. This album has many ggod songs on it. I personally like Heart Attack, and Pain for Pleasure. THis album is almost flawless except for one thing: it seems like the songs are all the same. But you really need to buy this album."
3,Pop-punk strikes again,"Someone should tell NOFX that somebody stole all their music and put Blink 182 lyrics on it. That's basically what Sum 41 is just Nofx type music which isnt abd but Blink lyrics is what make it not that great. I mean how many songs about girls can there possibly be? This album is ok but it's not the greatest and after a while it gets kind of annoying. Go buy NOfx, Green day , bad religion, mxpx, or alkaline trio instead."
2,this isn't that great of a cd,"I don't especially hate or like this cd, I just know that it's extremely hyped for no apparent reason, and isn't QUITE as catchy as everyone likes to make it out to be. That's all."
3,"Stupid, but in a cool way.","...this CD is worth buying if you like punk. The lyrics are kind of dumb, but isnt that what punk is all about? They write about how they're punks who don't care and about bad relationships, just like Blink or any other punk band. The rest of the CD isnt anything like Fat Lip, but its still cool. More like Motivation, I guess. Its not intelligent music for sure, and its a short CD, but the songs are OK, except for tracks 3 and 13. So punk fans, this is the CD for you."
4,good time fun,"molded in the blink 182 style how can you go wrong, the music is just straight ahead guitars and vocals much like green day, the best songs are the hits fat lip and motovation and in to deep"
1,A hole lotta filler not very killer,Well after hearing fatlip on trl i went out to get the cd. To my disapointment it went totally downhill from fatlip. The other songs dont have a message at all and most of them sound the same. Don't waste money on this cd (buy the single).
2,Whatever.,"If your kid is listening to this drivel (like mine is), then you can rest assured there's worse out there. This is harmless, imitation rebellion of little consequence. If they like it, fine.Still, you wonder what a bunch of Canadian kids could possibilly have to say about California punk. (About as much as Vanilla Ice had to say about rap, I imagine). The band needs to get their own life, instead of trying to borrow someone else's and sell it.There's nothing wrong with asking yourself ""Where did I go wrong?"" when you hear it coming from you offspring's headphones. But hang in there. In a couple of months, he and every other kid with this one will be tryng to sell it back at the used CD section (to raise enough dough for the inevitable ""Limp Bizkit's Greatest Hits"" disc.)"
1,This [is not good],"I have kept hearing people saying this is a hard rock alblum. Well, this alblum [is not good]. Sum 41 are only posers, they wouldn't know what music is if it someone showed it to them in the dictionary. All the songs can be considered whiney. It seems that this is just like all the ""rock music"" that plays on MTV, its just a bunch of guys with hair that doesn't look like its been washed in a week, pissing and moaning about whatever comes to their minds. Billy Joel rocks harder than Sum 41! If you want real music get Slayer's ""God Hates Us All,"" that is metal!"
4,If mxpx got into a fight with Blink-182 and NOFX broke it up,"Sum 41 would be what was left of it, which is a good thing. Minus the horns [from the 'Half Hour of Power' EP] and the bit of hip hop raps in between, we have a great rock band. Yes, they're a great rock band, because they love rocking out. Which they do well.After picking up 'All Killer No Filler,' I was expecting a good album, and I was right. It was great. A personal favorite was ""Heart Attack."" I also like how the band keeps songs under 3 minutes and seconds, thats nice...well, except 2.They also have a few goodies for your CD-ROM. So if you're into all that nice poppy-punk that everybody seems to be getting into nowadays, get Sum 41. And if you haven't already, pick up Mest's album, 'Wasting Time.' I'm reminded of them as well, after listening to this album. I'm glad I could have been assistance.Enjoy!"
2,Not At All Like Fat Lip,"For those of you who heard Fat Lip on the radio and decided to go out and buy this, like I did, think again. This CD sounds nothing like the energetic, awesomeness of Fat Lip. It sounds like some of the songs on Enema of The State by Blink 182 that I don't like to listen to. Do yourself a favor and just download the mp3 of Fat Lip and burn it onto a mix, because this CD isn't worth the $14 that I paid for it."
4,Action packed punk,"This CD is the best out from Sum 41. None of the songs sound the same and there is a lot of variety. There is alot of base and drumming. Many of the lyrics to the songs are also quite amusing. This is a good CD and I recommend that you listen to it first before you buy it, just incase you don't like their style."
4,Despite its mainstream status..... they are a good band!,"Everyone out there who doesn't like Sum 41 for the same reason as Blink better get their heads examined. This album is has its good songs. They were smart for putting ""Fat Lip"" and ""In Too Deep"" as singles cuz those two are one of their best songs. I predict the next single is probably ""Nothing On My Back."" I also like their fastest song ""Never Waking Up"" but I do think that they should make it a little bit longer but the song is a good lead into ""Fat Lip."" Even though I really don't like metal, their ""Pain For Pleasure"" song is pretty decent and the guitar riffs are catchy."
3,Good Effort,"Ok, to set things straight. Sum 41 is a band w/ great talent and potential. It just seems they lost sight of what a punk band is all about. They abandoned loyalty to true punk fans and went for the money. But hey, the album still has sum great songs. ""Fat Lip"", ""Nothing on my back"", ""Motivation, and ""In too deep"". The rest of the album gets boring too fast. The songs are similar and a bit boring. I hate the fact that those stupid TRL teen pop freaks listen to this. They practically make me want to puke. If u want more true punk that u can be proud to say u love. Listen to MxPx, NoFx, Rancid, AFI, New Found Glory and others."
3,Cut in Half,"I think that the Sum 41 CD has a couple of good songs, but some of the tracks I don't listen too. The first track is stupid because it is just talking. The good Part- My favorite song on the CD is Fat Lip. The rest of the songs were OK."
4,sum41 never say they wer punk,"sum41 never said they were punk they said there rock punk, pop punk. u people are stupid they arnt sellouts either.um41 kicks ass"
2,"1 star for the last song, 1 star for the drummer","Eh, if your thinking of buying this, its not as amazing as you might think it is, i bought it because i loved the little song at the end titled ""pain for pleasure"", my opinion the only good song on the album. What saves this album is the drummer. Stevo is quite a good drummer, his rating is an A-."
3,iight CD,This is an alright CD. Nothing special really. It's alright to listen to but once you've heard it four or five times it gets old fast. Their lyrics lack meaning. Just another fake punk pop band.
1,this is punk HOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,in the song Fat Lip the guy fricking rapping!!!!!!!!!! and in the song in to deep he's just whining!!!!!!!!!!!! i didn't hear any other songs but this still sucks as i can see. bands such as stink 182 and pimple man they sound very similar if not the same.you want real punk? THAN HERE IS SOME RRRRRRRREEEEEAAAAALLLLLL PUNK ROCK!!!!!!RamonesSex PistolsVandalsDropkick MurphysRancidBad ReligionDistillersect.other fake punk poser bands to avoidpimple manstink 18good charlotte (couldn't think of an insult)Green day (hmm they're ok but they are posers)
1,"That stupidhead who cusses. It should say this, not badworda-palooza....","OKAY!! You little stupidheads that like Sum41 and Blink182... let me ask you something. If they aren't PUNK... then what the heck are they? They certainly ARE NOT pop, or any of that other stupid type of music... and you obviously don't know what the heck you're talking about, so shut up and sit your bottom down. And, no, I'm not saying that all that other stupidity isn't punk or anything. Everyone has their own opinion, right? And, they all stink. But, still. Here's mine. There's no need to go off and make fun, or like Blink182, or Sum41, now is there? Bet they have a heck of alot more talent then you and they're stinkin' trying. They're two whatever bands. The pop generation is going downhill, and punk is rising. THE HECK punk is dead, ya dumb retard. Anyways, I'm out."
2,No words can describe how much they ....,"I was dissapointed when i got this, for some reason i thought that these guys were going to be a resergence of the before punk-pop mid 90's punk rock that i really like, kind of like Green Day's insomniac, but it sounds just like every pop-punk band out their and it ..., all their choruses have na-na-na-nananana in them, it is just pop with distorted guitars."
1,"Awsome CD, man!!","Wow, this is one great CD. The singer can really rap on ""fat lip"". Kudos for that guy for singing about mullets and putting his music on TRL. That show is the SHOW of punk!! That's just DOPE!! My brother (who's 18. he's old) keeps telling me that punk was originated by ""The ramoans"" and Joey Ramoan. Well, he is a poser and bands like The Clash, Pennywise, and Anti-Flag are as well. I play guitar and sing for a cover band called the ""Punk Kings"", and play music from bands like Good Charolette, Blink 182, Green Day, New found glory, and such. you know, REAL punk. If you don't buy this CD, you aren't a real punker. DUDE!!"
5,One awesome cd,"This is my favorite cd,New aged punk these guys are the best out there.But if your like me you wouldnt wanna spend your money on half hour of power wich is ok but nothing compared to all killer no filler."
1,"Horrible, Sissy Music","It makes me mad that people consider this punk.This isn't even CLOSE to punk. It is a lot like Blink 182, but I don't mind them just because their drummer is really good (Travis Barker). If you want REAL punk listen to NOFX and Bad Religion. Have you noticed on these reviews when people rate the songs, they rate all the bubble gum, sissy songs 9 or 10 and they rate Pain for Pleasure and Never Wake Up really low. Those two songs are the best on the whole CD."
1,THIS IS WEAK ... PUNK AT BEST,"OK kids lets go over something, this is barely punk, while I don't like the style that Sum 41 is which would be the carbon copy of Blink 182 like so many other super trendy ""punk"" bands. Blink 182 seemed to have started this purely pop-punk genre, now what you guys want to listen to is your business, but if you want real punk try one of the older bands that actually started it Like The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, The Dead Kennedys, or the Clash. Or if you want something more modern try AFI, The Living End, or The Offspring. I am personally a big Offspring fan and while I will admist they have drifted towards a more pop like flavor they still retain the same great punk attitude that these new bands so sorely lack. Cancer didn't kill Joey Ramone, he just heard Sum 41 and did him in."
4,They're good....,"I purchased this CD today, and I listened to it right away. The intro was a little disturbing, but I basically loved every single song. The only songs that were simply OK were ""Summer"" and ""Crazy Amanda Bunkface"". ""Crazy Amanda Bunkface"" is amazingly similar to ""Fat Lip"", in the bass parts and some of the lyrics too. Of course, my two favorite songs on the album were ""Fat Lip"" and ""In Too Deep"", but I also liked ""Handle This"", ""Rhythms"", and ""Motivation"". But all the songs are really great and upbeat, with excellent bass, drums, and guitar parts. This is a great listen and I strongly recommend it (although I only gave it 4 stars because the songs are quite repetitive, and that gets quite annoying)."
5,Every song kix!,"This is a great album! I will rate each song below :1) Introduction to Destruction - 0/0This is only the intro and sounds pretty cool.2) Nothing on My Back - 5/5Very upbeat3) Never Wake Up - 3/5Extremely short, but an okay song.4) Fat Lip - 5/5Quite possibly the greatest song on here!5) Rhythms - 5/5More like a sequel to Fat Lip (rhythm-wise)6) Motivation - 4/5Upbeat, but could have been a bit better.7) In Too Deep - 5/5Slower than most the songs, yet very upbeat.8) Summer - 3/5Very short song, but nicely made.9) Handle This - 4/5Slowest song on this album, but can touch you emotionally.10) Crazy Amanda Bunkface - 4/5Not too bad, but not perfect.11) All She's Got - 4/5About the same as above.12) Heart Attack - 5/5Slow to fast song. This one is really awesome!13) Pain for Pleasure - 4/5Short but awesome song without lyrics!"
5,i luv this cd,"me & my bro bought this cuz we both luved the song ""fat lip"". that is still my favorite song off this album tho i also luv in too deep. this is a brilliant album & i recomend it 2 every 1"
2,Wasting talent,"This cd is complete garbage except for the very last song. i wish these guys would stop wasting their talent and starting making metal instead of making mtv trl tennyboper ...pop punk garbage. they obviously have the ability to do it, but insead they waste their talent. i dont understand it. ive also heard that they do a cover raining blood by slayer live. i dont understand why they are wasting their talent instead of making good music. i give it two stars only because of the last song. the rest of the cd is complete forgetable."
4,my reveiw,"I think that this CD has only one good song on it, but that song is a very good song and it makes this CD four stars all by itself because it is an amazing song. The song is called FAT LIP"
3,"Heard It Before, But Still Fun","It's easy for somebody to compare Sum 41 to pop punk bands like New Found Glory or Blink-182. For the most part, this is true. There are many similarities between these bands, but this doesn't mean that All Killer No Filler isn't a good record. It's 12 tracks of pure fun (not counting the intro). The one thing that Sum 41 does that no other power pop has done yet is create a ""Beastie Punk"" sound on the song FAT LIP, which is probably the funniest, and best, song on the album. In summary, this album doesn't make any new revolutions or start anything significant, but it's fun, and I bought it for (price), so who am I to argue?"
4,A guilty pleasure.,"I myself am not a big fan of the recent pop-punk bands that have been pouring out of the music industry lately. ... But Sum 41 seem to be just a bit different. With a sense of humor (that is actually amusing!) and catchy riffs, Sum 41 have created a standout among their peers. Like everyone else, I was instantly hooked to ""FAT LIP,"" with it's references to mullets, Judas Priest and El Camino's. The rest of the album, however is a little different. Funny most of the times, but occasionally slipping into the typical. But if you have a sense of humor, then you are most likely to enjoy All Killer, No Filler. ..."
5,Appropriately Titled!!!,"The first thing I have to say about this awesome, five star cd is that there's no mistaking it with Blink-182. Sum 41 has a distinctly different sound, which I happen to love. It's faster and more punk than Blink-182 and very enjoyable to listen to! All the tracks are up tempo and the lyrics are interesting too. There isn't one track that I skip over. Sum 41 is definitely making a name for itself and I must say it's well desereved. I was (and am) very impressed!"
5,Repsonse to Negativity,"I am writing this to all people who like or love any sort of punk rock. This CD is awesome. It is a quicker paced cd that shows the true talent of this band. Some other reviews say that it ... because the CD is ""POP-PUNK"". They are only mad because bands like Blink 182 and Weezer actually have talent and they can play their frickin instruments with skill and chords other then power chords. Bands like the Ramones and Misfits only play a monotonous sound of screaming and yelling about absolute nonsense while Sum 41 has a point in their music. It is great music and definatly worth the money you might pay. Do not listen to angry ""punk rockers"" because they do not know what real music is. They are stuck in their world of sex drugs, and rock and roll without actually seeing the truth about decent bands like SUM 41!"
1,Geez what a pile,"Who do these kids think they are? The Beastie Boys? Not hardly. The Beastie Boys are talented and unique, this band is so ordinary and radio friendly it makes me ill. Sounds sorta like it should be the soundtrack for a teen movie or something. For god's sake, please dont buy it."
3,"Generic, not much variety....but nonetheless good pop-punk","First off, this band would no be classified as punk/rock, it is more like pop-punk, which isn't bad. This album has some great songs on it, but most of the album has the same problem all pop-punk albums have:lack of variety. The only song that seems to stand out as different from the rest is In Too Deep, which sounds like Sugar Ray and is also the next single. Pain for Pleasure is different, but it is a joke song mocking hard rock. (I like PFP, because I hate hard rock) You get tired of listening to this CD if you start from the beginning, so if you are like me it might take time to discover the ending tracks. All in all, just another pop-punk band with a pretty good cd, nothing special, but still worth buying."
2,LISTEN TO ME just another rock band,We love Green Day and Offspring but we dont need Sum 41. By now you would think they would have relised cheesey rock is out i mean its nearly as cheasy as your local cheese shop. If you like this you can not be called a rocker more like a pop fan who buys the cheesyist relises every week and a bed room full of spice girl c.ds but the spice girls are not as cheesey as this. O.K Fat Lip is the best song on the album sorry i meen the only good song on the album if you like Fat Lip buy the single dont waste your money.Hope this helps you.
3,Loses It's Touch,"As you should already know, Sum 41 used the highly popular pop punk formula to make this CD. They added a bit of rap/rock and a bit of metal to it but despite that, thats just what it is. Generic pop punk music. Its not bad. But its not excellent either.This CD is awesome when you are 12 but when you grow up a little bit, your opinion changes of it. If I wrote this review a few years earlier, I'd have given it 5 stars without question. But now, its lost its touch. I still like it but not nearly as much.So in short, I recommend it to those in a younger crowd or those who are looking to get into pop punk or punk music. If you are already a pop punk or punk fan, skip it. Its nothing you haven't heard already."
5,"Oh my God, this album is KILLER!!!","I can't belive it... I'm listenin' to this cd since last week... and is the first time I love ALL the songs of an album. It is like a drug... absolutely 5 stars: great voice(s!) and the music is... wow! Go on guys, I'm waiting for another cd like this!I would recommend this cd to anyone love The Offspring, NOFX, Carcass, Pantera and Iron Maiden."
1,"NO Killer, YES Filler...","Awful. words can't describe this (stuff). Sum41 is nothing but a childish pop band with guitars and drums, just like Blink 182 and Limp Bizkit. the only good thing this band have is their guitarist, just too bad that he wastes his talent in this horrible band."
4,not their best but still good,Out of their 3 albums this is my least favorite but I still like this one a lot.Introduction to destruction- not a song but quite funnyNothing on my back- one of my favorites. good song 10/10Never wake up- takes a very long time to figure out the words! abit silly really. 5/10Fat Lip- very memorable a bit rapish. 7/10Rythms- probably the least memorable track on this album butstill good. 8/10Motivation- can get stuck in your head but i like it.8/10In too deep- a bit poppy but ok. 7/10Summer- from Half Hour of Power.good song 9/10Handle this- i think this is the best track on thealbum. i like the guitars.great. 10/10Crazy Amanda bunkface- ok but can get a bit boring7/10All shes got- for me this kind of merges in withCrazy Amanda. 7/10Heart Attack- This song is great. 10/10Pain for pleasure- bit of a joke but good song.8/10Makes no difference- (uk bonus track) from Half Hour of Power. abit catchy but good. 8/10overall rating 8/10
2,They have potential - But fall short,"I find Sum 41 to be another product of the cookie cutter pop punk industry. I hate to say it to you 12 year old kids who enjoy Blink 182 and Sum 41, but they are not punk - They are pop, plain and simple. Here's a little hint for you PunkRawkKing, its Ramones. They were one of the founding fathers of punk, and I hate to say it but your brother is right. The Clash is also another founding father of punk. Have some respect little man."
1,this album is no good....,"a long time ago, my friend told me this was a great punk album....yet, i just made a mistake by buying this.This isn't even punk rock or even close....this is an album made for 10 year old skateboard kids who think they are ""bad"" and ""cool"".The rapping is soooooo irritating...face it, if you have the slightest musical tatses, dont buy it"
2,deja vu,"as soon as i finished listening to this CD, i thought i was listening to the beastie boys. I think of this group as a Beatie Boys tribute group, sorry no creativity here."
1,...And they just keep coming.....,"When will they stop coming? All these silly poser bands just keep coming don't they? Sad thing is that this is what MTV calls ""punk"". Sum 41 is just another band like Green Day, Blink 182 and any other stupid wanna-be punk band that lacks talent in writing good lyrics and good music. Some people call this punk rock. Others call this emo. This is neither at all. If you are in the third grade, then its all cool for you to listen to this band. Stupid, weak, boring, repeative junk is what this band creates. Totally useless!"
3,"If you think you might want it, then get it.","If you love Blink 182, you'll sort of like Sum 41. Sum 41 has several great songs on their CD ""All Killer No Filler"", but the CD itself is way too short. At 32 minutes with only about ten songs aside from their intro song and their goofing around songs, listening to the CD on repeat will just get annoying. As a whole, the songs are all pretty good. Some songs are really good, but the rest all sound the same for the most part. There are also QuickTime videos on the CD, but they are not very entertaining.If you've heard ""Fat Lip"" or ""In Too Deep"" on the radio, or if you've seen the videos on MTV and you don't like them, don't even think about buying the CD; they are the best songs on their CD, though ""Motivation"" and ""Heart Attack"" are really good too. If you do like those songs, then you should definitely buy this CD."
5,You don't know the facts...........,"To the person who reviewed this using all capitals before, get your facts right before your say stuff about a group of people who supposedly like a band or style of music!Firstly...I LOVE SUM41! And I....DON'T SKATEDON'T HAVE POSER FRIENDSDON'T THINK I'M COOLI AM NOT PUNKI DON'T DRESS PUNKI DON'T CONSIDER MYSELF A REBELI DON'T HATE MY PARENTSSo before you say something that MIGHT be true about other Sum41 fans, make sure you know that people like their music for all different reasons.I know it's not the punk of the old days, but it's new pop punk style and not everyone is going to like it...BUT I DO! And I don't like their music coz I am trying to be some sort of cool punk or something! I listen to it coz I like the sound of it, that's why I listen to music...coz I LIKE IT! Not coz anyone else does...END OF STORY!!!"
2,This cd would be better used as a drink coaster,"In my opinion, this cd (disappointed). Minus only 3 or 4 songs, All Killer No Filler isn't worth my 15 dollars. The only good songs are ""In Too Deep"" ""Never Wake Up"" ""Heart Attack"" and perhaps ""Fat Lip"". These are the only songs that are worth anything at all, don't buy it. The songs i mentioned above are good, because they have some good lyrics and a good sound, but there is alot of repeition of badness on the cd. There's a track that is practically the same as ""Fat Lip"", change a couple words and some chords. I think it's track 10, and this song is only better than the rest of the (stuff) on the cd. You'd be better off downloading the few songs then wasting the (money) on Sum 41. Use it to buy yourself a clue if you even want to buy the cd."
3,What the hell is this supposed to be?,"Sum 41 is not a bad band. That said, Sum 41 is not a good band either. Yes, Half Hour was good, but it got old fast. All Killer is good, and it as well got old fast, but much faster than Hour. The main point to make is this: THEY ARE NOT A PUNK BAND. They are not even an Emo-punk band. They are a band. Their music is catchy, their lyrics are a bit funny. But they are not punk. When we(and they) realize this, we can enjoy them for what they are.....for whatever they are....."
4,I can't seem to keep my finger off repeat,"All Killer No Filler offers some of the best music Sum 41 has ever put out with singles such as ""Fat Lip"", ""Motivation"", ""In Too Deep"", and ""Pain for Pleasure"". I also like ""Nothing on My Back"", but I feel as if they lost some of their edge. Their music sucks without Dave ""Brownsound"" in my opinion. Their first two albums are good, and they worsen after that. If you're into Blink 182, this is a must buy."
2,two songs and nothing more,"this album counts only ""in too deep"" and ""fat lip"" as decent songs. The rest is, well, all filler. And the record is only half an hour long, so there are only about another five complete songs (track one is a reminder of Maiden`s ""number of the beast"" and track three is 50 seconds long). It makes you wonder if the guys that wrote the two hit singles wrote the rest of the album as well.Piece of advice, tape or download the singles and spend your money on something else."
4,Listen to the music,"People are arguing that Sum 41 isn't punk. Well perhaps you haven't noticed, but punk now isn't the same stuff that Minor Threat and all the old punk rock bands played. I don't know if Sum 41 is punk, it's getting really hard to tell nowadays. While my liking of this CD did wane a little bit when it reached #1 on TRL and my sister started liking Fat Lip, the CD is undeniably good. It's very catchy and melodic and there's lots of vocal emotion put into it. There are some songs that are pretty bad, such as Pain For Pleasure, and some songs are just kind of annoying, but it's a fun CD that will make you want to listen more and more. Besides, if it's not punk to you, why whine about it not being punk. The poseurs will come no matter"
5,there ... good!,"Sum 41 is a great band. in all killer no filler they focus on ppunk rock. My favorite song on the CD is crazy amanda bunkface. People who like punk rock , and who like blink 182 should take a look at this.c yase!"
1,..........Punk Rock?,".....yeah right!....well,you want a review for this album........ok........this is the worst band in the world..is music for 5 years old brats who think they're cool listening to whining sorry lyrics and boring rappings......if you're into punk listen to real punk bands........what about some wizo.....they are young neither.......or bad religion...they're gods.........don't be a sucka my friend and if you bought this album gave it to your little cousins,......but I don't think they're dumb enough to take it........."
2,I can't believe I bought this CD,"All I can say is that if you are looking for a CD that sounds the same the whole way through this is the one for you. The first time I tried to listen to this CD my friend and I both got migranes. I have to say I like a couple of the songs on this Cd but it's not worth buying the whole CD, just get the single."
2,2 stars for one song.,"Sum 41 has always been a band I looked down upon, their cd Chuck really anti-impressed me except for ""Welcome to Hell"" which is the only reason I'd like it, and this album is very similar in that aspect. The only reason I'd ever put this cd in the stereo is to hear ""Nothing on my Back"" which is a wonderfully crafted song and actually ... at least close to punk. But besides that nothing really appeals to me, Rhythms is an ok song but the rest sounds the same pick up some Rancid or NOFX if you want punk.I don't suggest you buy it maybe just download Nothing on my Back."
4,Another Blink 182 type band,"Sum 41 is another Blink rip off like American Hi Fi and A New Found Glory and who knows how many other bands. But you know what? I happen to like that style of music. That said this is a pretty good cd, it is very short (32 minutes) but full of fast guitar and catchy lyrics. This cd is in no way ground breaking, if you want something that sounds different go buy Radiohead or Tool or something. The bottom line is if you like the pop-punk kind of stuff by Green Day and Blink 182(people call it punk but it isnt really punk, if you want punk look for NOFX or something) this cd is for you."
1,"not bad,not good either","well i've heard the song ""fat lip"" and i like the beat but the lyrics are [junk]. if you don't want to ""conform to society"" why play your videos on mtv. if you are on mtv you are a sell out(blink 182,p.o.d.) don't get me wrong i like some bands on mtv but they are still sellouts(p.o.d., red hot chili peppers, creed). if you want to listen to punk or pop - punk listen to relient k or dogwood they have good lyrics, good beats, and a good message. by the way ""fat lip""'s lyrics are all filler..."
3,Michael,"The chain is garbage. Broke within seconds after opening the box. Pendant is perfect. Small but all jewelry is smaller than you think it will be. :PStones are a tiny bit lighter than I wanted but She loved them as is, so thats not an issue that matters.I recommend the item for a man that wants something very nice but also a little different form the usual fair.Also, it doesn't break the bank. :)Would have been 4 to 5 stars if the chain had not been so substandard."
2,Disapointing,As a twenty plus year hunter of big woods Bucks in northern Minnesota I held high hopes for this book.It was a disapointment from start to finish!It proposes to provide insight and strategies into hunting Northern whitetails and only offers sporadic stories of various hunts Hal Blood has participated in.Look elsewhere!
2,If I ever hunt northern Maine I'll reread this book,I hunt large public forests in Ohio and Kentucky and thought this book would have some helpful advice. It didn't have much. The techniques he talks about are not likely to be as useful in snowless higher deer density areas.
3,Not so bad karaoke cd!,"Most people who like Karaoke CD's might like this one. Overall rating is 3 stars, most karaoke cd's are a 2 star rating. The tracks ""Ese Hombre, Vivir Lo Nuestro, and Que Ganas De No Verte"" are really close to the original track. ""TRACION"" sounds similar to a ringtone...SEDUCEME (ballad) doesn't really sound close, but the Salsa version is a lot better. This CD is recommended for Karaoke collectors and India Collectors. Others might feel they wasted there money."
1,Not compatible with DVD player -- avoid!,"I purchased this unit off of Amazon.com and discovered only later that it will not work with any DVD players. If connecting your television to a DVD player is important to you, do *not* buy this unit."
4,A timely novel,"See storyline above.This timely novel about terrorists and the Mideast has a riveting beginning, and doesn't let up till the end. I think people who like espionage novels will enjoy this book. From the twists and turns to the few surprises you'll find, this book will keep you engrossed from start to finish. Enjoy.Recommended for readers of spy novels."
3,it was ok,"If your'e really looking for a diaper bag that is not too big to carry,this is a good product to get. Though it doesn't have enough space inside. it is good to use when you just wanna go out really quick and lazy to carry a bulky diaper bag."
3,Unsatisfactory,"I enjoyed the beignning, but after that it went downhill, in part because I couldn't understand his descendant's all-consuming love of the house. The third part of the book, set in the early 20th century, was the worst as the owner said little and did less. I liked Elswyth Thane's Williamsburg series but wouldn't recommend this book."
5,Precision and Accuracy Movado Quartz Dress Watch,I bought a Movado Women's Collection 14K Solid Gold Diamond Watch for my wife in August and my sister kept bugging us for one so we bought her this 14k solid gold Lumeti with the classic Movado Quart movement for her 62nd Birthday and she loves it! It is not as dressy as Movado's signature gold and diamond watch with the black face but just as elegant in my opinion. Any recipient of this lovely gift with certainly always think of you when they check their watch for time or when others comment how beautiful their watch is. Good luck and get a Movado for your loved one for the Holidays! Good luck!!
3,"FAIR, BUT NOT THE BEST","While this album has some hit tracks that I enjoyed: ""Notorious"", ""Who Shot Ya?"", ""Dead Wrong"", ""Can I Get Whitcha"", ""Dangerous MCS"" It just had too many boring songs. It would have been better if they left this album at 10 or 12 songs. I think that it's creative and interesting considering the fact that B.I.G. is dead but I think that ""Life After Death"" was a lot better album then this sub-par stuff. What a way to let a legend go out."
1,Wrong item,I Had purchase this item as a Christmas gift and they send me the wrong item very disappointedI had to purchase another gift so I never reordered the correct item
5,high energy performance,i think the live album is a great step for any Crüe fan to pick up full of smokin riffs and thunderous drumming a must to own for your Crüe collection knock 'em dead kid. looks that kill being my favorite!
4,T-Bone would approve!,"He's been a part of Roomful of Blues and The Fabulous Thunderbirds. He's cut a number of very fine solo recordings including two collaborations with Herb Ellis. This one is a labor of love. ""Blue Mood"" is a tribute to and the songs of the great guitarist T-Bone Walker. I didn't know how much an influence T-Bone was on Duke until I picked up a T-Bone Walker collection. Duke is a master of T-Bone's stylish, fluid, swingin style. Recommended if you're a fan of either gentleman. Very well done!"
4,Two Sides Of Sonny,"This album plus the ""Soul Classics"" compilation on Prestige provide half the picture of what Stitt was up to in the late '60s and early '70s. For much of the time, he went where the money was (and there wasn't very much money at all in anything but fusion in the early '70s): with an organ trio or quartet. Don Patterson is the organist on ""Low Flame."" He also appears on ""Soul Classics"" along with Jack McDuff and others. This is jazz with a lot of funky soul in it, not funky soul with a lot of jazz in it. And Stitt is in great form. The other half of the picture, the one without the grits and gravy, can be found on the ""Endgame Brilliance"" compilation on 32Jazz, with Sonny in a straight-ahead setting with Barry Harris on piano. Both halves have their distinct pleasures, and both have a premier bebop altoist/tenorist at the top of his mature form."
2,No Fresh ideas here.,"I was very disapointed with this CD. After being overjoyed with his previous albums Gaia, Gaia II, Kosmos, and V (with Valentine). It had the same great harmonies that those other albums had but lacked any deffinate melodies. The songs, It seemed were a bunch of random notes with Harmonies taken by several of his earlier songs thrown in. Many songs sounded like his other works with different verses and very slight changes to the chorus. There were really no new Ideas here. I thought some of the songs were his earlier songs recorded backwards. I expected this CD to be much better. It seemed Valensia was in a real hurry to release a new CD even though he really had nothing fresh to give it."
3,Hogan's Wisdom,"Always interested in getting better in the field of my golf game, I read this book with the hopes of gleaning some useful information on the swing, and how to hit the ball farther. Hogan offers a breakdown of the swing, and it is easy to follow. Not only is the book illustrated, Hogan did a nice job articulating how to get better and hit it longer. One thing I found that was very helpful was in the last two pages, Hogan talks about course management, and tricks to saving shots when you are playing in all types of conditions. This was a very informative and useful section of the book.There are many golf-instruction books out there, and this book stands the test of time, as did Hogan's golf game. I recommend it to any golfer."
3,moderately satisfied with the product.,"I purchased a used book and would expect to see the usage but too many pages were uderlined in red, which somewhat defaced the product. The book is excellent in terms of content."
1,one time only,the book is great but it was so dried out it fell apart the fist time i read it. They also failed to mention it was the pocket version.I dont't think they should call it good condition if you can't turn a page without it falling apart.
1,Ben Hogan not so Hogan,Ben Hogan has done it. He just made the WORST golf book in the world. I quite golf after reading this because it made golf so boring. BEWARE!! This book is the WORST book I have seen before.
4,Many fundamentals that stand the test of time,"Ben Hogan's swing was the template for the modern swing. For a piece of golf history, this book is still a worthwhile endeavor to read. Although some clubs are not widely used such as the Brassie, 2 wood, 4 wood, Hogan's advice regarding the fundamentals and strategies still stand the test of time.The book is well illustrated with helpful captions, although some drawings are misleading and should not be mimicked. Hogan was not known for his putting and the putting chapter is not very useful.Reading into the mindset of the champion and the vignettes of golfers in his era, are quite fascinating, and I thoroughly enjoyed the historical perspective.This book still stands as a classic in the Silver Age of Golf. I highly recommend reading it."
2,Not Hogan's Best,"Not Hogan's best but still some useful information. You would be better served to buy a more modern expose on the golf swing, there are plenty of good books about power out there. One good one is Power Golf for Women it is surprisingly excellent. Another although for the short game is Dave Pelz's Short Game Bible. Plenty of books to choose from but it is always nice to have the Hogan name in your bookcase:)"
1,Hastily fabricated,"Although the author claims to have high credentials, he presents very lousy descriptions of exercises, with complete disregard to grace or esthetics.As soon as you pass the well designed and colorful cover, you will be immersed in a collection of poorly sketched exercises. Each exercise is described in three or more steps, which provide no clue on the proper execution of exercise. Most of the exercise sketches are flawed and hint to the total lack of experience or exposure of the author to athletic performance.Although the book was first published in 1996, there were then reasonable level of technical skills and knowledge with publishing good illustrations that the author disregarded."
4,The kind of book that renews your faith in humanity,"No, with killing and bombings and trash dumped in the street and racial hatred, Kosovo doesn't sound like a great place to visit.But when Paula Huntley's husband was sent to Kosovo to help establish a legal system, Huntley impulsively decides to accompany him and later jumps into teaching a group of Kosovo Albanians English.Unexpectedly, Huntley falls in love---with the country, with its people.Yes, I'd heard of Kosovo, but I doubt I'd have been able to write a coherent essay explaining much about the conflict there prior to reading this book.I recommend this book. In some ways, it reminded me of Reading Lolita in Tehran. But can we self-centered Americans ever read too much about areas of the world where people don't spend most of their day at the mall or playing Nintendo?"
2,Not the best work of this Sci-Fi giant,"The title is deceptive as the stoy's main character is not the one called Titan's Daughter. Instead the main character is her husband/fiancee. This work by ""Futurian Society"" author James Blish suffers not for the passing years in terms of hard science; the technology is kept generalized and deliberatly vauge. So it reads as well today as when it was published. Its most delightful and disappointing fact is that the villian is more three dimensional then the two other main characters. And that is saying something in a novel meant to show the evils of prejudice by pitting normal(evil) humans against genetically manipulated(good) eight foot giants. A quick read, but has some staid plot mechanisms; old but beloved scientist-grandfather type who is murdered by villian in order to set up the climax."
2,Not the best work from this Sci-Fi giant,"Noted science fiction writer James Blish writes a passible furture tale were genetic engineering has produced a group of nine foot giants that are the objects of ridicule for most of the population. The story suffers from several flaws, It's hard to sympathize with the main characters, they are very two dimensional. The vilain is more interesting but not by much. The story also uses some staid plot mechanims such as ""hero is framed for murder he did not commit"". And the title character is not really developed. The reader can easily see Blish's Utopian leanings, but they just don't register."
2,Not advanced and back-dated,I am a RNA-chemist and I bought this book from amazon.com to get help for my day-to-day research. The moment I had my first glance at this book I was frustrated. This book has described fairly old methods but no contemporary techniques. This book is not even descrided the techniques in an advanced manner which is expected for a book based on so specific field. I would not recommend this book to anyone who has atleast the basic working knowledge of molecular biology.
5,Excellent way to learn Photoshop Elements 2.0,"I started with the Users Guide that came with the software and couldn't make heads or tails of it- mostly verbal descriptions of visual processes. The ""Teach Yourself Visually Photoshop Elements 2.0"" made everything clear. It is a wonderful book and learning tool. After you read it (it's a smooth fast read) you can go back to the Users Guide (which is OK once you have a feel for the program) to pick up a few more details, or feel more comfortable with the on-line help or other, less visual, books."
2,"Super Illustrations, missing details","If you use other graphic editing programs, this book will serve as a jumpstart using Photoshop Elements 2.0.If you haven't used graphic editing programs, don't use this book. While the illustrations are SUPER, many of the functions are not explained, so the reader doesn't get a good understanding of what they are doing."
5,Old school death metal,"A really diferent line-up with 5 members and Peter Tägtgren was only one guitarist. It is really diferent from the Hipocrisy of almost everybody knows, but it is great. Sharp music with the old school touch of brutal death metal."
4,solicited suggestions*,"The posters are great!a little biger size would be even better,Everything was perfected BUTto much wrapping material for such a simple item...the tube is good enough,save on BOX and Plastic air!!!United States is a little funy about all this...SIMPLE IS ALWAYS BETTER!! FOR EVERY ONE!PEACE,China"
5,Jet Li rocks,"A couple of Jet Li's earlier American martial arts films. I know he has been around forever in China but theseare two of his earlier American martial arts films before the story lines started becoming silly and convoluted;ie Unleashed, War et alThis two film collection is a great addition to your martial arts DVD library."
5,Jet Li,"Two of Jet Li's better later movies. Great price, and for all buyers, it's only ONE disc that's DUAL SIDED."
5,What's multi-zone?,"Has anyone tried this ""multizone"" model yet? Does it allow me to watch DVDs from any country? How's it different operationally from the normal LS5? Thanks."
5,Great gypsy playing!,"What a great release! I've like Mandino for some time, having 2 of his Note Manouche albums, and having seen him in Tony Gatlif's Swing. Here, he utilizes the pre-war Hot Club format: 1 solo guitar, 2 rhythm guitars, violin, and contrabass. The distinguishing feature of this album is that Mandino's playing and original compositions are a little more ""gypsy"" than what you usually find these days. Plus, you get 3 great songs sung in Romani!"
1,Great Disappointment !,"I am a fan of Howard Hewett for more than 20 years now and I think that he is among the greatest R&B singers on the planet. I saw him live in 1995 in Germany with Kirk Whalum and Paul Jackson Jr. wich was an excellent show, so I was more than happy to hear that Howard had a live album out. I couldn't wait to hear it, but what a disappointment! It doesn't sound like a live performance at all, it seems that they just added some (poor sounding) audience noise to the end of some studiorecorded songs. If you like Howard Hewett, I suggest that you spend your money on some of his studio albums, because you at least get what you expect."
3,The studio album comes across better,Go for the studio album versus the live one and you will be more fulfilled with the message and the sound...the interaction with the crowd does not carry over.
4,Useful Resource,"As a student studying children with disabilities who also works with families with children of disabilities, I would say this book is a useful resource with reliable information. It gives a general overview of disabilities, their causes and treatments as well as ways to help parents cope. I would use this resource as a textbook or an informative book overall about disabilities but as a resource for parents, it gives way to much information about topics that may not be relevant to them and could be seen as scary and blunt. It's a good, general introduction to children with disabilities. This is an excellent resource for people who work with families with children with disabilities as well as a useful educational resource."
3,Not the best...,"Probably the most overplayed song on the radio in 2004 so far, I'm sure everyone's heard ""Yeah"" by now. Usher used to be a smooth R&B singer, but now it seems he's headed in the mainstream pop direction. Oh, and the guy screaming brainless things such as ""YEAAAHHH!"", ""LET'S GO!"" and finally, ""OKAAAAYYYY!"", that's Lil' Jon, producer of this track. His beats always sound the same however, like the beat on ""Yeah"" sounds almost exactly the same as the beat on Petey Pablo's ""Freek-a-leek"". Ludacris drops a pretty good verse in this one, but this song can never be anything more than a mindless pop hit. (The video is a pretty cool complete with lots of seizure-inducing light effects)"
1,Major heart attack factor here.,"Some of my friends tell me I listen to the wrong stuff, that I should move out of my whole ""Another teen supporting classic rock"" thing. Maybe that's true. But that doesn't keep Yeah! from being a bad song. And don't think the rest of this is good either.When I first heard this song, I thought whatever. Kinda forgettable, kinda boring. But then it started turning up everywhere ya looked and that really P'ed my O, if you know what I mean. (If you don't, you should). Yeah! is so boring and just goes on and on and on and has major heart attack factor. On a scale of one to ten, I give it a 0.0000000000001. To all you Usher worshippers, wake up and try 60's rock, 70's rock, Parliament or James Brown. You'd like them a LOT more."
1,I could review this...,"...but I'd be wasting what watty420 already wrote. ""Yeah"" sucks, so does Flusher, er, I mean usher! (lol)"
3,riding lil jon's jockstrap,"not bad, but not song of the year either better be some hot girls on the dancefloor for me to really get into this."
1,boring Lil Jon cut,after a while the Crunk Cuts all sound the same&just have more Bark than Musical Bite. Usher jumps on board for a easy Hit but a forgettable song.
1,Usher killed everything.,"R'n'b was once a bunch of old dudes who would sing and have trumpets and things in the background. it was cool, all the fans were happy. Then usher came along with this thing he calls ""R'n'b"" and kills it all, and then he brings two good hip-hop artists (lil'jon and ludacris) and sucks all the fluid out of them killing them. he brainwashed all the kids, and now instead of hearing people saying ""that guy makes good music."" all we hear is ""that guy is so hot."" it's really quite disgusting. I might go and rate the albums, I haven't heard them, but i've seen the cover, and that seems like enough for you people to base a judgement on."
2,Usher's losing it.,"I don't know what's happening with Usher..I miss his days of 'U Don't Have To Call' and his other smooth R&B hits..I used to like this song, but it's COMPLETELY overplayed and it's not even one of his best songs. It gets old fast. It doesn't make it any better that they added untalented rappers to the mix of artists on the track (not all, but some) It's sad. Usher, go back to your 8701 style."
3,"A Little Obnoxious,But A Good Mainstream Move.","I have to admit that I liked this song the first 1,000 times I heard it,but it doesn't really have the longevity and artistry of the songs on his new and great album,""Confessions"",but it still has good production and Ludacris is a good addition to it.A little annoying,but still likeable.And,like I said,a good mainstream move,just not a good move if he wants to be known as a serious artist.Recommended:Yes"
3,Yeah....OK!!!,"Possibly one of the biggest hits of 2004, is Yeah any good? Well it has a nice beat, Usher's got a good voice, and Ludacris sounds good on it too. Too bad that I find Lil Jon sort of annoying and the fact that it don't take that much talent repeating ""yeah"" over and over again. My opinion don't matter anyway..."
2,Not Yeah!!,"It just comes to me as a surprise when it comes to artists stepping beyond the mainstream now. There just are too many exactly sounding the same. For Usher, that really isn't at all a adequate sign to enhance a long-term career. Anyway, he still has a long way to go with collaboration. His single, Yeah!!, a collaboration with Ludacris isn't really a all out song that stands out to me. Although the song does have some great beats. It really isn't the kind of collaboration I was really expecting of Usher. I was hoping for more of an Hip Hop Soul ballad, just like he had with You Got It Bad. This song is great, but it is just tiring, because it has been played out already."
3,"Pet me, Squarepusher.","Go Plastic is my favourite Squarepusher album. That said, I usually skip the song My Red Hot Car. Like it's supposed to, the song has that pop music rapid expiry date, and so now I've heard it enough and I can't stand it anymore. It's like a Britney Spears song that way.The other two songs are good. But you could probably find them on LimeWire, is what I'm guessing, although that might be improper!Squarepusher owns me as if I was his little kitten."
2,Not what i had expected..,"For those people who think this is just another Unearth album it is not!! It may have some band member that just carried the name, this is definatly not one of those hardcore albums, i was so dissapointed, however Nirvana fans may like this album, it is definatly different & may take some time to listen to. However, if this is really an Unearth album then it is not thier best album, this is b4 the 'Unearth' we know is formed.. im assuming Mike Rudberg was the person that was in 'this' album & just carried the 'Unearth' name.. my suggestion is if your not rich, dont buy this album. If you got other cds that u can buy, buy those instead."
5,Very Well Written,What a novel. The disfuntion of a self centered father and the hidden rage of his neglected wife are brought to light by this very insightful and disturbing family saga. This novel illuminates how much children really do see and hear.
5,Outstanding Percy Compilation,"This book is perfect as either an introduction to Walker Percy's thought or as a final collection of essays for the longtime fan. ""Signposts"" is the only book available that provides Percy's writing from virtually every stage of his life, including the period when he was completely unknown. That fact alone makes it worth the purchase."
5,WHAT A GAS..BEEN CAUGHT LISTENING??,"One of the king's of VOMIT MUSICK..PUNGENT FUKKINNG STENCH!!! These Austrian sicko's were one of the best band's to ever exsist in the EXTREME MUSICK scene!!!I like their first album better(the ORIGNAL cd press of that is one of the best cd's ever!!!) but still this is right up there with it!!BASS HEAVY, bowel removing FUN..from your fav teenage trio from the land of HITLER!!..prob the most obscene band ever, LOOK OUT OR YOU MAY JUST INDULGE IN SOME PUNGENT REEK!!!''SPLATTERDAY NIGHT FEVER''"
4,The History of American Sailing Ships,"Not a ""to do"" modeling or building book but an excellent history of early American sailing ships (mostly late 1700's and early 1800's."
4,Magnet access,"We purchased a Pet Safe cat door and magnet for our cat Sugar to keep her safe. It really works, however, I guess the magnet keeps getting attached to things/places and pulls the collar off (gets lost) and she is unable to enter. So that is why we keep ordering them. It can be an expense, but the price you offered for the two helps. Thanks"
5,Born Again,"I feel that Puffy did his homework on this album. Colaborating with the different artist really makes a great statement in the rap community. The album is great and just wish Biggie was here to enjoy it as well. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to enter my input.Peace and Love,Marty"
2,Not enough melodic harmographones,"We need more Snoopy Willis on this album. It missed the mark. I think that Notorious B.I.G.'s duet with Enrique Iglesias was phat, but his rendition of ""We will rock you"" with Rick Ocasick of the Cars sounded drab and unloquacious. I think Snoop Willis Willis is the next real star and really the only bright light on this album other than the duet."
2,"I'm sorry, folks...Biggie is long gone","What happened to the legendary Notorious B.I.G. a.k.a. Biggie Smalls, a.k.a. Christopher Wallace? He used to be really good but I dunno what happened to him. The ONLY good song...and I mean ONLY good song on this album is Dead Wrong. That is the only song that Biggie left behind on this album with a true gangsta rap beat. Do yourself a favor...don't buy this album. I made the mistake. If you are looking for Notorious B.I.G., go with Life After Death."
1,Should have been buried with him,"This is ""grave-robbing."" You think Biggie wants to be remembered for garbage like this? Never a big fan(that ""out-of-breath"" style never made me ""move."") Throw this in the garbage and remember his real-work....OUT!"
1,What Hell Is This?,"This is no Biggie I'm used to listening to. This album is plan wack. This best song on this cd is ""Dead Wrong""(feat. Eminem). The rest of it is terrible. I think Puffy made this so he could get some money from it, since his album didn't do sh@t on the charts. Please don't waste your money. Go get Eminem's ""The Marshall Mathers Lp"" or Dr. Dre's cd before you get this junk, but, if you like Biggie that much, then buy it. I warned you. By the way, why do people keep saying that Biggie is the best rapper of all time? He only made 2 albums, well, 3 if you count this album. You'd have to make more than 2 or 3 albums to call youself the best."
3,Mediocre at best.,"This is Biggie's most disappointing album. It seems like Puffy took a bunch of incomplete songs the Big Poppa started before he was killed, then brought in other artists to finish up the lyrics, and spliced it all together. Most of Biggie's portions are lackluster...the lyrics just don't seem to hit as hard as his other two albums. It's evident why these haven't been released before.I've only listened to the album once since you've bought it compared to the 8 times I've listened to Cube's new one. This should tell you a lot."
2,"rest in peace, B.I.G.","this c.d. could have been good if puffy had any idea of how to maximize an album as a product. he will get one teenybopper hit and put it on a weak l.p. he has perfected the art of selling out. i hate to see such a waste of money. don't support that gravedigger puffy. how disrespectful can you get? ask puffy. the lyrics are what makes this record get any ratings at all. it has barely any replay value cause the greatest rapper of all time doesn't mesh with those weak, sell out, remixed beats. if you listen to ready to die and life after death you will definately see that this album is so below biggies standards that he wouldn't put it out had he been alive cause it would have been his downfall. puffy was his best friend and his biggest disgrace, yo."
2,its aight...,"this album was ok, but was weak for a biggie release....puff kinda messed up the album, i wouldnt have minded waiting even longer for a new biggie album if it was done a little bit neater....but for all yall go pick this album up...cuz it does have a little bit of biggie on it...but on the real go pick up the new 2pac+outlawz cd...cuz that is mad tight!"
3,Try Again!,"I believe the consensus that BIG is one of the most prolific M.C.'s off all time. Hense, he does not need a flurry of other M.C.'s to complement his game. Instead, they distort BIG's music with mediocre skills. Or at least they seem that way flowin' alongside his BIGness. So, the cd is worth owning just because, but don't expect another classic. Come on Puff!"
2,puffy combs. born again,"The untimely death of notorious b.i.g. was a very sad time in the hiphop community. Even sadder was December 7,1999, the day this album dropped. This record features a whos who list of mainstream commercial rap. The only bright spot of the album is the Eminem verse on ""dead wrong"". I am still mourning because of this album."
4,Dead wrong,"i'm just gonna say this: HEAR DEAD WRONG. possibly the greatest beat of all time, crazy lyrics. simply an AMAZING song. call me stupid, but it's definitely top 3 songs all time, in my opinion. emphasis on the word opinion."
2,Worst!!!,Ok I know the man is gone from us and we usually rate people who died or passed away with a little more remorse. Not me! Biggie wouldn't want it that way. ( I said that like I knew him)This is just an album Puffy or P.....whateva put out to let us remember Big. This was the worst album since Ready to Die and that wasn't a bad album.This album to me was just a filler of a legacy of one of the best rappers of the game. Biggie didn't need this album. It's been 6 years and I am still on the Life After Death CD. That is the best double disc Cd I have ever heard.With that said if you are looking a a leagcy cd from Biggie....this isn't it. If you don't already got Life After Death.....then go get that. This album just doesn't do it for a Biggie fan like myself.P.S. Don't band some of the songs though.....I thought the song with Cash Money was pretty good. Peace!!
3,ur dead wrong!,"Just wana say that this album is ok. It aint bad or good it just ok. It kinda rubbish actually but what makes it ok is the tune dead wrong and notorious.Dead wrong is my favourite song on the album featuring eminem. But it aint cos eminem's on it, its because on this song biggie smalls just goes mad and its pure thuggery. This tune is totally crazy but only if you have the explicit version. This tune alone pushed the rating of the cd up from rubbish to ok.Notorious is a good song to and if you want these tunes i suggest you download them or something cos the album is kinda dissapointing."
2,BIGGIE IS ONLY A MEMORY !,"THIS ALBUM IS OK.LIFE AFTER DEATH WAS WAY BETTER.THESE R THE ONLY GOOD TRACKS 3,4,6,14.DON'T BUY THIS GET SOME SINGLES."
4,BORN AGAIN GIVES US FANS A KIND OF CLOSER/TO HIS DEATH,"BORN AGAIN ISNT LIKE 'READY TO DIE' BUT AT LEAST IT SHOWS TO EVERYONE THAT WITHOUT """"B.I.G."""" THERE IS NO """"PUFFY"""" AND THAT ALL THE TALANT """"""WAS B.I.G.S."""" and without B.I.G. there will never be a star as great as him ...nomatter how 'PUFFY' trys he will never be BIG!"
3,Notorious B.I.G.: Born Again,"Nothing against Biggie but this album doesn't deserve more than I gave him. Just because the death of B.I.G. doesn't mean critics can just overrate an album. This album was 1/5 of BIG's because he never done a song by himself. To me, Puffy did a great job makin this album sound like all of the feature artist was actually in the studio the same time Biggie was, it was clear and will eventually help the BadBoy label gather it turf back. All in all this CD is worth buying because of all the other artist on it, but it just simply isn't enough of Notorious B.I.G."
3,Some Things are best left alone....R.I.P. Biggie..,"Biggie was a great MC who's demise was tragic. The young MC from New York blessed us with the classics Ready to Die and Life After Death. Sure he has other material that didn't make the previous albums but some things are best left alone. Unlike the Tupac camp that released a lot of good material after pacs death...Biggie's camp threw together an album with bad production quality and a list of MC's that Biggie never worked with. Sure the sound of biggie and Nas on a track is lovely but this never happened therefore it takes away from the remix of ""Everyday Struggle""..Yeah ""Dead Wrong"" is probably one of Biggies best songs but the rest of the album is just all over the place...This is not how you pay homage to the great Biggie Smalls....this album does nothing for his legacy..."
4,Big Poppa Forever,"I don't know what people are thinkin when they say Biggie doesn't rip it on this album. True there are a lot of guest spots on this album but that just shows the love and respect everyone in the rap game had for Biggie. Just about every verse that BIG has he rips it up, DESTROYS it. It really shows that even if it may not be his best work, Biggie is better than 95% of all MC's in the game. Most of the guests are fresh, especially ""Dead Wrong"" with Eminem, and ""Rap Phenomenon"" with Red and Meth. I was weary about this album at first myself, but when I listen to this album it saddens me that Biggie had to go so early. He still had plenty of rhymes and metaphores to amaze us with. When I go to heaven the first thing I'm gonna do is go check out the Eazy-E, Tupac, and Notorious B.I.G. show cuz I know they are still holdin it down. Basically I recomend this album to everyone and to Biggie, we still love you playa, you'll never die!"
1,IF U THINK THAT THIS ALBUM IS TIGHT THEN U DEAD WRONG,"With all due respect this biggie album (an exception) was ruined by puff daddy once again, now puffy if you ruin your album that's somthin' but if you ruin an album for biggie and he is not even alive to defend himself that's a crime. It is sad what puffy did to the album especially with the guest appearances."
3,So-so,"This is definetly not Big's best, but how can you be mad at him if hes not even with us anymore? (R.I.P.) This CD is made up of bits of unreleased Biggie verses and even some freestyles thrown into new beats and featuring some good and bad rappers. I bet biggie's rolling in his grave being featured on a track with the Cash Money Millionaires...but anyways there are some nice cuts on this album. The remix of Dead Wrong is dope with Eminem really tearing it up, and several other tracks meet the Biggie standard. Now I know everyone says Tupac's post-death albums are better, well thats because he left tons of work, biggie didn't have that much time, he was taken way too early. Overall this album is okay but if you want really B.I.G. try his classic ""Ready to die"" or his final CD ""Life After Death"""
2,doesn't do Biggie justice,I agree with the editorial review. This album was ruined by the plethora of guests. It sounds more like a compilation than a Biggie album. If Big was solo on this cd it would probably be a classic.
2,"Puff, you should have let him RIP,","Biggie would never put out garbage like this, and I don't even like him that much, but come on...Half these songs don't match, the guest appearances are terrible, this album is a disgrace to Biggie and his mom and anyone who buys this will be let down"
2,Thanks Puffy,"Thanks Puffy for screwing up another album. You know this could have been a great album but thanks to puffy release of Notorious with him and Kim rapping mostly to something Biggi dropped in 95 you obviously see Puffy wants to be the one to shine not Biggi. Come on fans buy this album so Puffy could show off more ""Ice"" and push his $200,000 car with jennifer Lopez. Support this idiot."
4,As good as a post-humous album can be,"Compared to Ready to Die and Life After Death, Born Again lacks a lot. That is to be expected since this was made more as a tribute to BIG than by BIG. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of good stuff in here, and the intro itself gave me chills the first time I heard it. Many of the songs are better after having heard them a few times than after only hearing them once."
3,It's ok,"Well,this anit the most awesome cd there is out there right now,but it is also not the worst,dead wrong and notorius big were my fav songs on this album,the rest of the songs (no disrespect 2 the late great b.i.g) were kinda weak,if you r thinking of buying this cd for christmas or something,i suggest 2 get the new dmx or dr.dre or 2pac,but if u cant get those i guess this album will do,bottom line........not the big's best but it's ok"
2,there's got to be something better than this to remember....,one of hip-hops greatest by. Puff let the man R.I.P. You had to go and mess something good up. This album has a couple of aight tracks on it. But I feel some of the people on the album would have never even appeared on the same stage as biggy if he were alive. So will somebody please tell me why they are on his post-deaf album. I didn't buy the album because he was dead but I bought it because I am a fan. this album is a disgrace to a legacy. Puff I hope you are at his grave aplogizing for insulting on of hip-hops finnest. this joint should have never been droped. and if I had a chance to get my money back I would. quess i will have to listen to some of his old albums till I get this one out of my mine because it pisses me off to listen to it.p.s. yo puff tell jennifer to come get up with a real man. ha hastay up yall one
4,Biggie Lives...,This album is as phat as they get! Biggie lives! Biggie flows like a master on all of these cuts! Pick this cd up... You won't be disappointed!
3,How can you not see?,"Biggie is not dead. The guest rappers spot is just a fairly good ploy to hide this fact. Not like Tupac, who is consistently coming out with new material despite having died. I mean, please, people. How could Snoop Dogg NOT show up? He's a big crusader on the gangster front lines, pushing for the leader of the Crips and this as well. It's a front I tell you."
1,BIGGIE KILLED 2PAC WESTSIDE BABY!,"this cd sucks,along with puffdaddy, puffy and badboy. The eastside has only 3 ok rapers jayz nas and dmx check there cd's out, otherwise forgot notiourus b.i.g. he's just like ja rule a fake, trying to inmate tupac. He wants to be a thug but he can't be one.A real cd is Tupac shakur REPPIN WESTSIDE BABY!"
3,Notorious B.I.G.: Born Again,"Nothing against Biggie but this album doesn't deserve more than I gave him. Just because the death of B.I.G. doesn't mean critics can just overrate an album. This album was 1/5 of BIG's because he never done a song by hisself. To me, Puffy did a great job makin this album sound like all of the feature artist was actually in the studio the same time Biggie was, it was clear and will eventually help the BadBoy label gather it turf back. All in all this CD is worth buying because of all the other artist on it, but it just simply isn't enough of Notorious B.I.G."
2,What are you people thinking?,"I can not believe that the majority of listeners are giving this album strong reviews. Before you freak out-- wait. Biggie was (maybe) the greatest off all-time, but unfortunately this album does not stand up to his legacy. With a couple of exceptions, the beats on this disc are straight WACK, and though Biggie's lyrics are always on point, the ones on this album are not even close to his other two. To the reviewer who said this is the first Biggie CD you ever bought-- you need to check yourself. You shouldn't be reviewing Big Poppa unless you are first schooled to the genius of his first two albums. This album stands as the biggest disappointment of the year to me."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,this album should have been calledW.A.O.A.T. - worst album of all timebiggie is one of the greatest but this album is one of the worst.there is only 4 good songsDEAD WRONGTHE NOTORIOUS B.I.G.WHO SHOT YAWOULD YOU DIE FOR MEall the rest are horrible. its all guest appearences by the worst rappers in the game.and the beats are just garbage it dosent even go with his flow on any of the songs except the 4 good songs i named.PUFFY you are the WORST producer there is!!!!!!!if yall want a good bigge cd go get ready to die or life after death.DO NOT!!!! buy this albumthe only good thing about it is that it came with a poster
1,Why Biggie why?,"This is garbage. Worst after death album ever. First of all it isn't even a solo CD. There are like 30 rappers on here. Biggie doesn't even rap on some songs. Dead Wrong is disresspectful.""I'm shooting babies, no ifs ands or maybes."" This guy went way too far this time.Man get that Better Dayz CD by 2Pac instead of this."
1,Why?,"What would compel someone like Puff Daddy to release a CD like this under the name of Notorious BIG? Biggie didn't even know half the artists that Combs put on this record. This isn't a Notorious BIG record, it's a Puff Daddyish -- remix everything, guest star half the world, disgrace the name of a true artist -- cash crop for the masses. Biggie would never release this!"
2,AS USUAL PUFFY RUINS ANOTHER GOOD ALBUM,"Puff daddy simply put too much commercial stuff in this album. If Biggie was alive, he would never put an album like that. An album like this one is supposed to be showing why is Biggie the greatest rapper of all time as people say, but instead he made a soundtrack out of this album."
2,B.I.G 'Album' BIG FLOP,I don't know why bad boy didn't just tell us they had a biggie tribute Cd and that biggie was featured on the CD. His Big (forgive me) picture on the cover had me feeling that we were getting to hear another biggie masterpiece like life after death.Well the only reason it gets 2 stars instead one are some great beats made Ok by not so Ok rappers.As if BadBoy didn't get enough dough from I'll be missing you and promotion of The LOX from we'll always love Big poppa.they shoulda borrowed these beats to another artist or borrow some ideas from those doing tupac's post-humous releases.
5,Great tribute to Biggie,"I love how the songs come together and how Notorious is so weell accepted. I like the travck Dead Wrong and The intro is very chilling, a must for any rap fans out there."
2,PUFF D. SOLD HIM OUT!,"Puffy knew biggie was the illest of all time, and so do we all. Why did he have to put that out? JUST FOR THE $!! I gave it two stars because you can feel some of those skills from the two others.....but everything else sounds off. What the hell is emenem doing on this? And those other fools!?! I respect puffy wanting to add to the album, but he messed up. He should have released the original versions, that would be hot!"
5,Tragic reminder of a great MC,"That was Biggie's greatest gift as an MC: the ability to turn a seemingly painful situation into a source of humor, endearing himself to everyone from the hardest thugs to the most passive rap dilettantes. For moments, on Born Again, he lives on."
2,"You bought this, you're dead wrong.","I have to say that the only good track was ""Dead Wrong"". It has some the greatest lyrics ever, bar none. Eminem lights up the mic. It's just a shame that Biggie is gone, 'cause Em and Biggie would have definitely compiled masterpieces. The rest of the album was lackluster."
3,This Should Have Never Have Been Done,"I don't really have much to say about this album except that it is really a disapointment. The album is weak in many ways. First off, this album probably should not have even been made. Some tracks are absolutly pointless (Hope You N***az Sleep) and on more than one track Biggie raps are taken from previous songs (I Really Want To Show You). What is that??? The only thing that saves this album in my mind is the cut ""Dead Wrong"". Although I know some of you are saying Eminem had nothing to do with Biggie, quite frankly, I don't care. He drops such a fantastic verse on the song that it earned this album three stars in itself. One other notable track is ""Rap Phenomenon"" with Red and Meth. But even there, the dynamic duo raps aren't even that great. And that is the storyline of this album, guest performances that are really just terrible. So terrible, that not even the late great Notorious BIG can save them. Don't bother with this album."
3,"SOME OF IT WORK , SOME OF IT DONT","Here is a reasonable review with out all this Puffy bashing.. The problem with Biggie's Born Again CD is the paring on these tracks some of the combinations work some of it them just dont work a lot of these artists that appear on this cd has little or anything to do with Biggie ..This is more like a tribute to the man rather then being a Biggie albumSome of the tracks that does workDead WrongDangerous Mc's (feat Mark Curry, Snoop, Busta Rhymes)Come on ( Feat Sadat X)Who Shot Ya..Outside of these tracks and maybe the one with the Hot Boys.. these are the only that works all the other material is just mediocre.."
1,Not worth it,"This cd would be better if BIG was still living because he wouldn't let Puffy put this out, at least not with his name on it. There's too many featured guests, Eminem wasn't even out before Biggie was killed. Biggie made Bad Boy and without him they're nothing. Buy this only if you want to collect all of Biggie's cds. That's all it's good for."
2,Puffy should be ashamed of himself,"In theory, this would actually be a good album;compiling unreleased material form the man, myth and legend himself, the Notorious B.I.G. But the majority of it is just rehashes of previously relased stuff,though Rap Phenomenom is a tight song. There are some good spots though; putting Who Shot Ya?, the B-side of the ""Big Poppa"" single on the album was a GREAT move. But if this is really supposed to be rare B.I.G stuff, where's ""Party And Bulls**t"", his first hit that was on the Who's The Man Soundtrack?"
2,"""PUFFY JUST TRYING TO MAKE MONEY OFF BIG""","I'M NOT HATING ON BIG, BUT CAN'T NOBODY SAY HIS ALBUM IS BETTER THAN PAC'S ALBUM. I'M NOT SAYING ITS COMPLETELY WACK, BUT ITS LIKE HE IS A GUESS ON HIS OWN ALBUM. ""DEAD WRONG"" IS ONE SONG HE WHOLES IT DOWN ON HIS OWN. ""NOTORIOUS"" IS NICE TO BUT LIKE ALWAYS PUFFY IS WACK ON HIS VERSE. PUFFY PUT WAY TO MANY PEOPLE ON THE ALBUM. I HOPE HE DON'T PUT OUT ANY MORE BIG ALBUMS. SO WHEN U PICK THAT BIG UP DON'T LOOK 4 A BIG ONLY ALBUM ITS A COMPILATION ALBUM. AND 4 DA PERSON WHO IS TALKING ABOUT JAY Z, DMX, AND BIG KILLING PAC ON DA BILLBOARDS, ITS ONLY BECAUSE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE ALREADY GOT THOSE SONGS FROM DA BOOTLEGGERS. IF THOSE SONG WAS NOT RELEASE ON BOOTLEGS PAC'S ALBUM WOULD HAVE SOLD SO MANY UNITS. SO SUPPORT BIGS AND PAC ALBUMS. PEACE OUT AND ONE LUV..."
2,nahhhhh,"I'm a fan of Big but most of this album is shi@t. Puff is always gonna milk off Big because he has no talent except for marketing. To be fair though ..hasn't Suge survived off Pac's catalogue? Anyhow I think Big outshines every guest ..although some are interesting(em, snoop, cube). I'm waiting for the album where Big and Pac get down on the mic together from the grave. There must be something left in the vaults!?!"
5,Biggie Is Back,"I was kind of skeptical about Biggie's post-mortem album but he returns from a grave to give head shots to all those who doubt that he truly is the greatest of all time. His guest appearances, except for the Hot Boys(Hot garbage), were all top notch. He put out a record that cements his place as in the upper echelon of rap masters. Long Live B.I.G."
5,Its Definitely a Good Ready To Die Companion CD,"Ok, not every song is Ill... I read the reviews and thought twice but I bang that stuff just as loud as I do Ready To Die. Its got some jems on it."
1,This is horrible,"I would have given this cd a 0 but 1 is the lowest... everybody knows that TUPAC AMARU SHAKUR (R.I.P.) was and will forever be the greatest rapper of all time... TUPAC made biggie.. he brought him into the life of thug life.. then biggie went his own way and rapped about tupac's life... there is no comparison between the two... tupac is far more supreior. he's released more albums, he was a better role model, he worked harder, as a rapper and an individual tupac stands soley alone and there is nobody in the rap game that can compare to TUPAC SHAKUR... the greatest rapper of all time.. dont' buy this cd its not worth your money... puff daddy sings in it.. that alone should scare your money away.."
2,if u a tru fan,this cd aint all that if you a tru biggie fan then you go ahead and do your thing and you buy your cd. but if you int then i suggest you go buy that ish used from Wherehouse music. Ya feel me? the best song on there are dead wrond and whould you die for me and those get pretty boring and played out after a while if you play them enuff.
3,He would not be happy with this,"Its not Biggs fault that Puffy put tired artist that knows nothing about true hiphop on Frank Whites album. How can you put eminem in a BIG track . He never met the man and he is tired. Hot boys and Big timers. It was just all thrown together ,this should not have happen. I love my man Big but Puffy F#@k things up."
3,Boen Again... As average as they come.,"Born Again is a complilation of Biggie with guests in every song. It would be better to title it 'Remembering biggie"" or something. ITs decent, but if your a BIG fan then i would stick with your LIFE AFTER DEATH. Later."
3,born again,"born again had a few good songs. dead wrong with eminem is great. BIG raps great and eminems rap is raw. also dangerous mc's with Snoop Dogg is good, basically highlighted with Snoops rap. overall the cd is ok with some good songs."
3,LAST ONE,"IF B.I.G. WAS STILL ALIVE,HALF THOSE CORNBALL RAPPERS WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ON IT.I LOVE BIGGIE, BUT,THIS ALBUM FALLS FROM HIS GREATNESS.LYRICALY VERY GOOD,BUT THE BEATS WHERE NOT SET FOR THE ONCE KING OF NEW YORK.TOO MANY GUESS APPEARANCE,BUT WE KNOW WHY.PRIMO AND HAVAC (FROM MOBB DEEP),SHOULD HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PRODUCE HALF THE ALBUM.AND MAYBE I WOULD HAVE GIVING THE ALBUM 4 PLUS STARS.BUT YOU CAN'T PASS UP ON A B.I.G ALBUM"
4,excuse me?,"i bought this album from the store, then i take a look at it here, & something is not right. on this site right here, i look at the listing of song titles, and they are totally different than the songs on the album i bought! now it that because the listing on this site is wrong, or is it actually a whole different album? on the album i bought, ""dead wrong"" features EMINEM. and there's a song with MISSY ELLIOTT, and a song with the HOT BOYS. could someone who bought this album off this site please email me and tell me if its the same as the one i have, or if it has the songs that it says on this site, thanks"
3,To many re done tracks and guests,beats are chunky on dis but wow is there a lot of guests barely any of this is biggies work or if it is it is re done but worth picking up seems like a mixtape sorta5.5 of 10 lyrics 8.5 of 10 beats
4,Biggie for the next generation,"Puffy is a genius!!!! He used some of Biggie's best underground lyrics and added artists who weren't real big yet (Eminem, G-Dep, Black Rob, Beanie Sigel, Mark Curry) artists who were real hot at the time (Missy, Red and Meth, Kim, Mobb Deep) and some of the best who would have probably never would've done an album with him 5 years ago (Snoop, Cube, Too $hort). The album was good album for the year and probably better than 2pac's postdeath albums. Best song=""Dead Wrong"" featuring Eminem. Worst song=Coin flip between either ""Biggie"" featuring Junior M.A.F.I.A. or ""Niggas."""
1,F@#$*ed Up,"This was clearly another attempt by Puffyto make more money off Notorious. Thealbum is poorly put together. BIG's verseswere cut and pasted to each cut. Puffy/Kim,nither of which should be rappin, are all overthe place. BIG was one of the best rappers,but he was surrouded by probably the weakestcrew of all the greats (pac, face, nas, rakim,kane,pmd, etc.). Thats why he never reached hisfull lyrical potential as a mc."
4,read this,"ok i love Biggie and i'm gonna make this short. this is a pretty damn good album for someone that only had maybe 10 unreleased tracks. a lotta ppl think Puffy sold Biggie out, and i disagree with this. Puffy did his best to work with the material he had left of Biggie, and he did well. there are a boatload of guest appearances, with the odd showings of Snoop, Ice Cube, Eminem, Nas, and other big-name rappers. the song ""Dead Wrong"" is wicked overrated, and there's no point to it. the best tracks on this CD are ""Who Shot Ya"" ""Rap Phenomenon"" ""Notorious"" and ""If I Should Die Before I Wake."" This is an good album by any standards, but most reviewers hate it because it isn't on par with Ready to Die and Life After Death."
2,C Flat,"This book has many illustrations and bounteous historical context. However much I enjoyed the historical background, Purcell himself appears too infrequently and always as a nebulous figure. Sometimes the subject of the book appears to be the monarchy with Purcell as a grace note. There is no insight into the composer and we have no real portrait of him except as a catalogue of his music.I was disappointed that the subject never truly made an appearance and I have no greater understanding of this extraordinary composer."
1,life taking its toll on debbie,i cannot believe this cd is getting good reviews. she sounds awful people! and she looks even worse. why do you think she's wearing shades nearly all the way through her concert video? looking at her you see the results of years of overindulgence.
1,"Gurgle, gurgle...","It would be zero if 1 star was not the least of the choices. Rehashed bad ideas now - i.e., stalkers, obsessions i.e., calling and not calling. And, the so called 'new stuff' is comparable to nonsense syllables except for one pop tune. Not of substance. Gurgle, gurgle------"
5,Grammy Worthy,"Truly an amazing collection of live recordings from the latest Blondie tour in support of ""No Exit"". Not only does it highlight what a great group of songwriters Debbie Harry, Chris Stein and Jimmy Destri are but what an incredibly tight live outfit they have become. Clem Burke's drumming prowess must to be heard to be believed. Usually live albums are disappointing rehashes of the hits, in this case however the band injects new life and excitement into both new (Maria, Under the Gun) and old (Rip Her to Shreads, Sunday Girl) faves. It's certainly a treat to have in our prescence a real rock band like Blondie who actually write and play in today's overproduced souless pop landscape. Deborah Harry shines on this Grammy worthy release!"
1,don't waste your money,"What a piece of junk! It's chrome plated basest of base metal that actually splayed out as I pressed an olive with a pit too large for the ejection hole. I admit that the olives were Sevillanos, but still, the hole is too small. The upper guide, poorly soldered, fell off during second use. The press pin is not centered. I'm hoping that someone will read this review and respond with a recommendation of a pitter that performs well and holds up."
4,Pounding!!,"This is one of the heaviest albums I have ever bought. Its like a grindcore extreme death record with really deep growling vocals..If you are into extreme music, you might find this album enjoyable. If you are searching for something melodic, deep, insightful then go look for something else. (The review before this one is also mine, but I had done it anonymous first)"
5,The Truth is coming,"This book continues the truth about carbs. In the near future the big corps will be moving from the ""No Fat"" ""Low Fat"" to ""No Carb"" ""Low Carb"", people are starting to get the picture. And this book only emphasizing more and more of the carbohydrate facts and reiterates what Atkins has told us for years and years. It talks a lot about Phase 2. A weight loss ingredient that is catching on fast. I searched the web after this reading this book mentioned what to look for and found a great product called Max Strength Carb Eliminator by Baywood at .... I also found an up and coming site called ...... that is hoping to get the attention of large food corporations and restaurants to start offering more options for low carb dieters.The movement is here and people are wanting to live healthier lives and this book not only loads us up with information it suggests what food to go buy."
5,A GREAT READ - FASCINATING AND INSPIRING!,"Having heard the University of Pennsylvania perform at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and also with the Philadelphia Orchestra, I picked this book up out of curiosity. Then I couldn't put it down and had to purchase two more for friends as gifts. Bruce Montgomery's memoir of nearly 50 years working with talented college students and transforming them into a finely honed professional singing troupe is nothing short of breathtaking. This will make a great holiday gift for everyone on my list!"
1,Snows of Kilimanjaro,"Bought the DVD in assembling a Gregory Peck collection. Version was the one with Ava Gardner on the cover of the pack. The film was complete, but there was annoying technical noise, and quite a bit of fluttering in the picture. I may at some point buy another version of this DVD, but I do not recommend the technical quality of this particular production."
1,A dissatisfied viewer,The quality of this DVD is terrible. The sound track is off and does not match up with the visual speaking of the actors. The DVD kept jumping back to the beginning of the movie every few minutes. It was impossible to watch this product.
3,A Classic,"A fan of Gregory Peck, will enjoy this movie. Unfortunately the quality of my DVD,made watching this movie to fuzzy to enjoy. Thereby I recommend asking about clarity before purchasing."
4,"SNOWS OF KILIMANJARO,THE","A FOREIGN ADVENTURE SET IN A BROAD COLORFUL STORY.THE HERO-AUTHOR (GREGORY PECK) IS LYING INJURED ON THE SLOP OF AFRICA'S FAMOUS MOUNTAIN, Mt. KILIMANJARO.REFLECTING ON HIS PAST ADVENTURES AND ROMANCES..ALSO STARRING SUSAN HAYWARD & AVA GARDNER..MADE IN 1952.. STORY FROM HEMINGWAY'S NOVEL.RUNNING TIME:117min.DIR:HENRY KING"
3,HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH KILIMANJARO...,"As he lays dying,Peck pines for Ava whom heloves, while Hayward waits."
1,Do Not Buy Quality Classics Version,"I bought this movie through an Amazon Marketplace supplier. I got the ""Quality Classics"" Version. It is unwatchable. The Cover has a close-up of Peck and Gardiner. It is a disaster and do not buy it. I am a huge fan of Ava Gardiner and Gregory Peck and I couldn't get through this."
5,I love the video!,"At last I'm happy to watch the movie, one of my favourite Gregory Peck's movies, in excellent quality! Video&sound of new release (from March 6, 2007) are marvelous! I had been watching this as though it was a completely fresh movie. I began to love this even more."
2,GREGORY PECK,"I LOVE TO SEE GREGORY PECK, BUT I REALLY COULD NOT EVER GETINTO THIS MOVIES, I TRIED ABOUT 3 TIMES, JUST BOREING"
1,It took a lot of work to make something this bad,"BORING. A great cast. They have all made wonderful movies. Hemingway was blamed for the writing. The direction is slow with long, long scenes that go nowhere and say nothing. There is no memorable scene here. There is no memorable dialog. There is a war scene where Gregory Peck looks goofy in some war uniform, possibly French. He runs like a girl. This is just not a good film. Gregory Peck can be seen in a much better obscure film called ""On The Beach."" Also recommended would be Greg's ""Guns of Navarone."" For Hayward fans, ""I'll Cry Tomorrow"" and for Ava Gardner followers maybe ""Barefoot Contessa."""
3,Snows of Kilimanjaro,"This movie took a lot more acting than a lot of Gregory Peck's movies, but it is not my favorite."
2,More life a gun safe on your hip,"Holster is very lightweight, durable and conceals nicely; however, it locks too tightly makeing it extremely difficult to remove my weapon (Glock 27) without brute force and added seconds. I was hoping it was simply in need of a break in period but it has proven to be somewhat of a design flaw. I will probably toss it as I would not give this to a friend. I have owned other Fobus holsters which work great. It seems they just botched on the G27 model."
4,False: the Succesful Sequal,"In contradiction to their first and debut album ""Mindloss"", the element of speed was removed from this second album: False. But still as powerful and as heavy as it can get. The new drummer and guitarist made clear that it was time for a change, influences that'd ""neck"" Gorefest (and their respect) today. This album, however, is according to many people Gorefest's best work ever (personally I choose their first, Mindwork, but who am i?!). And I must admit, this album is a very nice peace of work. But again I have to mention; the tempo of most of the songs is rarely slow, but this does make it VERY heavy! Anyways; whether you like it or not, this is also a very classic deathmetal album."
1,Error in product quality,"Do not order this product. I ordered this kit and it came two days ago. The kit had nothing in it!!!! It was just the blue container. Granted, the container is of good quality, but it was supposed to contain the homeopathic pellets. So, I requested a replacement. The package came in a timely manner. I, literally, JUST opened the replacement package. There is nothing in it!!! Just skip this product all together. The shipper obviously has a QC problem."
1,Do Not Feed The Scammers,"Homeopathy is a scam of the worst kind. It is implausible. It does not do anything, and it is ridiculous. Please save yourself from wasting money that you could use on actual things that you might need. Do not feed the scam."
4,A strangely beautiful story of friendship,"A lovely book about friendship, kindness and caring that I currently enjoy with my 3 year old. Not sure if it's the illustrations or the plot or the idea of a rhino asking a ridiculous riddle in exchange for allowing the animals to pass or the little goose who simply can't help helping others...but something about this book has captured my daughter's heart and she wants to read it over and over. A great book to share with kids age 3 and above and would make a good holiday gift too. A more detailed review here - [...]"
5,bizzare but fascinating! :),"i hesitate to write a review of this book because it might appear 'pervy' just to comment ;) but in all fairness, this book is worth reading for anyone interested in science, biology, sex, or ourselves :) ..anyone who enjoys this book would also probably enjoy the weekly publication: NewScientist :)"
2,Dissatisfied,"The product was disappointment. I expected more. I requested the clean version, but received one with profanity. The selections were not as hot as his earlier albums. It didn't measure up to the hype. It was a waste of money."
1,Did Tip Sell Out?,"Has the Abstact Poetic gone mainstream? Will we ever hear anything that even compares to Tribe from this guy? Judging from the videos and songs I've seen/heard from ""Amplified,"" Q-Tip is just another hip-hop poser now. Sad, but true...let me know what you think."
5,Excellent,"I thought this album was great. It is an excellent solo effort by Q-Tip. My favorite songs are ""Wait Up"" and ""Let's Ride,"" but every track is strong. I've been a life long Quest fan, and the breakup was sad, but it's great to hear Tip again."
5,Abstract,"This is an album I bought when it first came out. I was a big tribe fan. I felt that Q-Tip had such a distinct sound and lyrically was one of the most underrated in the game. I felt that this album was slept on by many. I feel, in my opinion that this was one of few cd's that you can let start at the beginning and play all the way through. I was a little affraid for Tip at first but after hearing this, this was a great effort and something I would reccomend anyone to check out or buy."
3,Hate it or love it,".. I decided to put in some old albums because of the garbage rap on the radio nowadays. and i ran across Q-Tip's Amplified. i am a big fan of Tribe. especially Q-tip. When this album came out, I didnt expect a tribe called quest type beats. so it didnt suprise me like the other reviewers. The album does get a litle boring in the middle.. besides breathe n stop and vivrant thing (this song is still bangin) my favorite song is NT with Busta Rhymes. The Piano driven beat is incredible. Tip rides the beat like its easy and you know Busta is the best hype man in the business besides lil jon'. I reccomend this to all tribe fans!"
1,too much appealing,qtip was tight with atcq and when an artist goes solo you expect something different not just the same old assemble line music that we are getting? i've heard q-tip give better duet raps than what's on here.he has skills.it's catchy willie style music but with little substance.and q is better than that.
2,Broken,When the cd case arrived it was scratched and broken. Luckily the CD itself was fine. Perhaps the shipper could be more careful?
4,"Good Job, Tip","Q-Tip's solo debut is great. As others have said, its not his absolute best lyrically, but any Q-Tip fan needs to look into this. Simply beautiful beats. Amazing. Props to Jay Dee.Q-Tip still has a flame going. I hope a follow up comes soon."
2,ok if you like rap and music about girls,this cd was ok. it had all of his best songs but the other songs weren't as close as good. all in all this was a good but not great cd.
2,"this sucks that sucks, and oh yeah, that sucks, but wait!",this whole cd blows. for qtip its money over fans. the only good song is the track with KoRn. i would of gave it more stars but its only one good track and it could have been better if qtip was a better rapper.
4,Not as bad as some would claim...,"After buying the album, and reading all the negative reviews on this site, I felt compelled to defend q-tip a bit here. No, the album isn't as good as the first three TCQ albums, but it's still one of the better hip-hop releases this year. I didn't like it that much first, but I find that it's in my stereo quite often. Vivrant thing, NT, All In, and the hidden track are all good cuts. Sure, it's not particularly socially conscious, but some of the beats are nice, and Q-tip's timing and flow are still superb. It's a fun album, not a masterpiece. I hope that the old Q-tip resurfaces in any future work he might do... but this is an album worth buying and enjoying."
3,Surprisingly mainstream...,"I was a little disappointed by this album. Unfortunately, a lot of it sounds the same, and it sounds like Q-Tip is trying to have a pop album hit record. There are definitely some classics on here, but overall I was a little disappointed by the record."
1,Disappointing,"Just look at what other artists people who buy this album often buy. That shows what Q-Tip has become. Q-Tip once said ""I am recognizing that the voice inside my head is urging me to be myself and never follow someone else...,"" (Steve Biko 'Midnight Marauders') but Q-Tip is not himself. For the last ten years or so he has been producing music totally dissimilar to this album, and I'm still trying to figure out where he went wrong. I wish he hadn't released this album so that ""While other MCs say nothing and talk loud, if you're with the Tribe chest out and be proud"" (Money Maker 'The Love Movement'). I'm not proud anymore."
4,classic,i guess music like this is an aquired taste...in my opinion you could put this out now and bang it. i let sleepers hear it and they cant believe its been out for years.
3,AVERAGE ALBUM,Q-TIP CAN FLOW.HIS BEATS ARE DIFFERENT THAN ANYBODY.IT WILL HAVE YOUR STEREO BUMPING.HIS LYRICS ARE VERY CREATIVE.IT'S WORTH BUYING.
4,Tight,"A friend of mine bought this cd for me and I loved the whole thing. Even though the songs are mixed up from their original order, The Cd is great!"
3,Close buy not Quite,"A bit disappointing considering his history with the Tribe. Has moments, but none as funky as Vivrant Thing.The groove with Busta Rhyme (NT) is pretty cool with only HIGHER and THINGS YOU DO capturing the jazz-funk sound that the Tribe was known for. Real positive lyrics as expected for Q-Tip. The rating would probably be better overall, if the weak to so-so tracks did not bring the overall release down."
3,"Phat beats, lyrics weak","If you're an ATCQ fan you may be disappointed with Q Tip's new solo album Amplified. I was expecting more meaningful lyrics, instead Amplified delivered status quo lyrics with the all too familiar 90's hip hop superficialism. The only reference to any spirituality was his thanks to Allah on the CD package. As a huge Tribe fan myself, I had been waiting for Tip's CD for 2 months. Yet, overall there was no message from the lyrics. Despite the lack of substance I enjoyed the beats, especially the funky guitar riffs in Let's Ride. I recommend this CD for the casual Tribe fan."
2,Q-Tip: Amplified,"Beside ""vivrant thing"" theres nothing outstanding about this album. Q-Tip might not have the response about this album but, that what happends when bad album are made. This is not a total disaster at some points in the album he actually shows some of his talent that made him a elite MC when he was with A Tribe Called Quest. Overall if you like The Tribe you'll probablly find a way to like this, but don't expect to much."
3,Hard to understand,"I personally think I am the biggest Tribe fan ever, but this CD made it really hard to understand what angle Tip is coming from. There was only one song that really made me reminice of Tribe and that was ''Things We See'' It was the only ray of positivity on the whole album in my opinion. Lyrically I think Tribe fans are seeing another side of Tip that is shocking. Hopefully in the future we will see the side that contributed to Tribes success and level of respect."
2,"""Amplified"" should be muted","As a loyal Tribe fan, I was not pleased with Tip's first attempt at his own sound. It seemed that in his zeal for greatness he forgot what got him to this point. Tip compromises intelligent beats and thoughtful lyrics in order to go main stream and receive an abundance of radio play. Prior to this release, Q-Tip was my favorite emcee, but his latest album crushed all of my expectations and led me to the conclusion that Tip will never again reach a level of hip-hop like that in ""The Low End Theory"", or ""Peoples' Instinctive Travels and Paths of Rhythm"". I would have to say that Q-Tip has ended his dynasty as a leading underground hip-hop artist for the lights and glamour of television. I was reassured of my feelings when the better half of ""A Tribe Called Quest"", Phife Dogg, released his solo album which surpassed my expectations while remaining underground. ""Amplified"" might be abundant in popular sound, but as a hip-hop record, it falls short of the mark."
1,A Quest for the Abstract,"This album is a long journey to find the old Q-Tip, the Abstract. After listening to this cd for a couple of times I could only find two tracks that pleased the music lover in me. I think it is very sad and dissapointing to hear this album, after listening to the Tribe Called Quest for a period of years. I know we all like to show off our jewlery and the money stash, but to go from true hip hop to Crystal drinking and trying to be The artist formerly known as Prince, is just too much and very, very sad. Peace out to all the real cats out there Common, De La Soul, Mos Def and others that understand the essence of hip hop and it's meaning."
3,ITS... AIGHT.,"The beats are aight... Theres an interesting continuity, with one track basically running into the next, but... I kept looking for the substance... I give him props for progression, but, it just sounds like he sat around babbling about whatever came into his head.I miss the Tribe. It was time for them to break up, dont get me wrong. But I still miss the moodiness and depth of Tribe."
1,What happened to the Abstract Poetic?,"unfortunately he no longer exists, a once brilliant voice in hip-hop known as Q--Tip or the Abstract Poetic has become the Mainstream Poetic, this man who used to be about the music or the message now just wants money so he made his cd mainstream so that he could get in the lime light. what happened Tip? You was my idol! but not anymore, so long Abstract hello Mainstream"
4,"Tip's still on point, just havin' fun","Everybody's sayin' Tip is selling out, but I disagree. He believes music travels in cycles and is making up new genres as it goes along. The amped up beats are danceable and his lyrics are as playful as El Sugundo. Let him broaden his audience and keep his loyal fans. Q hasn't lost his flare for rhyme wizadry and if he holds a concert nearby, you can bet I'll be there. Buy the album."
4,Very Good but not Solid,"As a big ATCQ fan, This was something i've been waiting for...Tip Delivers the Goods..but but not the Pure Stuff.. The Album is A must for all Hip Hop Fans.. ""N.T."" is a Future CLassic & ""Do it, Be it, See it"" is a Cool INfo Music...Now we kNow!"
5,classic Q-TIP,this is a must have for any hip hop fan this is classic hip hop a must have for your collection
3,Q-Tip Just Wants To Make You Dance,"Q-Tip returns with an album that cannot and should not be compared to anything Tribe ever made. This CD is all about making you dance, plain and simple. Almost every song is bouncy and catchy. Q-Tip's lyrics are not deep or thoughtful but are not bad either. The beats are surprisingly on point, sounding like a Tribe album for the dancefloor. However, the last song with Korn is pitiful and should have not made the CD. Also, if you wnat some of the old Q-Tip, listen to the bonus track, ""Be It, See It, Do It"" and hear why Q-Tip is how he is and probably the most personal and best lyrics on the CD."
2,Could of been better!,"Oh no, Q-Tip... what have you done? This album is sure to crash and burn. Apart from 'Breathe and Stop' and 'Do It' this album isn't much at all... whats up with 'Vivrant Thing'? Try harder next time."
3,"Disapointing, but not bad","After hearin vivrant thing and breath and stop, i thought that the whole album would be off da hook. it wasn't. only one other song even comes close to those 2 and thats n.t. with busta. tip was alot better with the tribe"
4,Set the alarm clock next time!,"This is one of those albums for the heads. The beats are ridiculous. I don't know what made me dig it out tonight, but I'm glad I did. It's hard to find an album with consistently bananas beats after beats. Only one real drawback. Tip gets kinda boring after a while, but I still love the critter. A few more guest appearances would have given this phatty it's fifth star. Either way, it's one for us. You know who you are."
3,Abstact Poetic strait to Puff Daddy pathetic...,"Growing up A Tribe Called Quest was one of my favorite groups. Finding out that they were gonna break up killed me, but later found out that they're all separate ways...so I would be loyal to them and support them...Amplified comes out so I go and buy it, expecting to hear the usual Q-tip sound... I was surprised at how much he changed...Tip used to purposely not act this way when he was in ATCQ, but now he chose the route to go all for the catchy beat and rap about cars and women (played out miserably)...about 75% of this release is pure garbage, to the average quester... The only good tracks were ""Lets Ride"" (real nice beat and OK lyrics) , ""Vivrant Thing"" (even though it's topicless Tip made it sound nice) and the bonus track ""Do It See It Be It"" (shows a reflection of his youth)...If your interested in Tribe solo projects check out Phife Dawg's cd ... it's better than this, but its not a 5 star rating..."
2,QTIP - AMPLIFIED,"I bought this cd on the strength of the singles 'Breathe & Stop' & 'Vivrant Thing' which was a big mistake, 'cos i was very dissappointed with this cd! Don't get me wrong, the previously mentioned singles are awesome as you probably know, but the rest of the cd is very weak, which i can't see producing another single. So don't make the same mistake as i did by buying the album on the evidence of his two singles - or you too will regret it!"
4,Abstract to Vivrant,"Just because Q-Tip is not in a Tribe called Quest anymore, doesn't mean that he can't make good music. We all miss the complex flows of this hip-hop legend, but it seems there gone forever. But for now, Tip has an album out that is better than 90% of the music out now. When i first got thisdisc, I listened to it for two weeks straight. I was hooked. and I loved tribe. To compare this to a Tribe album is unfair because this isn't a Tribe album this is a Q-ip album. Higher, Moving Wit you, Do it, Thing you Do, N.T. and the Bonus track will have you out of your seat all day. The track with Korn is Okay, but not as good as the rest of the CD. He's not abstract anymore. But as this CD shows, a Vivrant Q-tip on the mic is still one of the top in the game. A welcome breath of fresh air, and a must have, especially for DJ's."
1,Q-TIP WAT THE HELLAFITZGERALD HAPPENED!,Amplified to me was a piece of [junk]! Q-tip you go from the Abstract poetic to the Jacka$$ poetic! WAT HAPPENED! There was a q-tip 10 years ago that would neva think of goin mainstream. His rhymes came straight from the heart and neva did wat the the others were doin. Thats wat made him a special MC. This new Q-tip is confused. Maybe its because of the break-up. Maybe its beacuse he went bankrupt and needed money. Or maybe he got hit in the head cant remember a damn thing from the past. I dont know but im sittin here listening to LOW END THEORY and wonderin wat happened. I give props to phife though but he is a little confused to. But i still love you q-tip and still will support you but on the next album think do it for the questers not the non questers. Q-tip i have faith in you and i hope the abstract poetic will be back hell i hope the tribe will come back together! But make me happy and everyonelse happy and bring back the old abstract in ya next album!
2,What Happened?,"What happened to one of the greatest rappers ever?This album is missing everything that was great about Q-Tip. I found it musically and lyrically lame, flat and tired.Very dissapointed.I was not expecting ATCQ, I was hoping for great new things.It didn't happen....This album is worse than ATCQ 'The Love Movement'"
1,is this for real? stay away,"I replaced the fuel filter in my mom's 1998 Civic, my old car. I have babied this car ever since I bought it new, there's nothing wrong with this car, $150K and going strong. I replaced the fuel filter and now the car makes a whistling high pitched noise. Next weekend I'll be taking it out and installing a genuine Honda fuel filter. A waste of time, stay away from this thing."
5,carlton and ford live in tokyo,"I just want to say that i agree with Bob Putignano on his review.This is a very good cd.Sure it would be a lot more fun to watch it on dvd, but what live concret wouldn't.As for mr. coronet blue ""larry carlton trys to play real fast..."" i have no idea what he's talking about.I guess some people have no clue what style is.Just because you don't like a style dosen't mean it's not any good.After all this is Larry Carlton we are talking about.Ask Robben Ford what he thinks of Larry Carlton.All in all a very good cd.Buy it it's worth it."
3,Los Tigres del Desierto/The Desert Tigers(1960),"Los Tigres del Desierto(1960) is a decent comedy starring Viruta and Capulina. Aside from a few sidesplitting scenes, the rest of the movie is forgettable! Do keep in mind this film has some politically-incorrect humor and ""Middle Eastern languages"" that are actually gibberish! LTDD takes place in a generic Eurasian country. Viruta(Marco Antonio Campos) and Capulina(Gaspar Henaine) have to rescue a baby prince after he's kidnapped by a gang of criminals. The video quality on this Laguna Films DVD is fine, but the soundtrack is hurt by this ""echo"" that plays during all 90 minutes of the film!In the plus column, sexpot Lorena Velazquez does a good job playing the film's heroine. What pulchritude(physical beauty)Velazquez had in those days! Even in a lesser movie like this, Viruta and Capulina can still make us laugh with their broad sense of humor. Viruta and Capulina were like the Martin and Lewis or the Laurel and Hardy of their time."
5,Really a lot of laughs-- something for everyone!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this little book. The authors have taken a clever approach to making fun of so many of the little annoyances in modern life. It reads like a stand-up comedy routine, and it's a load of fun. I've shared this book with friends and family and it never fails to get laughs (without being offensive or sacrilegious, either!)"
4,I Don't Have to Read it to Like It,"This is the funniest book ever written. I say this without actually having read it, but I'm certain that it must be, because I know Brett Bayne and he's just a stitch.In fact, the longer I don't read it, the funnier it will be when I acually do! Anticipation is the best part of anything. If I wait until next year, I may actually, physically die laughing.Okay, wait, I'd better buy it now and stave off disaster."
5,great item at a great price,"It may not look as nifty as the charger that came with my phone, but it certainly does the job and allows me to have a second charger at my office in case the battery runs low at the wrong time (often happens). As for the price... AWESOME !!!"
1,dude. this doesn't charge. wtf.,So I have a SGH-D807 that I bought over ebay. And I had to actually get new parts for it. I had to get a new battery for it.And I tried hooking up the charger and it doesn't work at all while the phone is on. Hopefully it just charges while the phone is off. But who knows.This product sucks. Really. They sent me a defect charger and I can't return it now because it's past 30 days.
1,I bought two of these. And I am a dissapointed,the first time i hooked it up i though is was not going to work. I have the samsung sghd807. sync. and when i plugged it in the phone was acting like it was trying to turn on over and over again. I left if for like 3 hours and the phone was still acting like it was trying to turn itself on. and when i unhooked the charger... the battery was still low. it took me awhile of messing with this to figure out that the phone has to be turned off to charge. this is a inconvenience to me. so that is why i gave it one star. if you dont mind not being able to make or get calls with your samsung sync while it is charging than this would be a good on for you.. it charges like a mo fo.. otherwise i would look for a OEM Samsung Charger for a little more money. and be able to use your phone while you are charging.Hope this helps anyone looking for one of these.
2,What in God's name is this CD???????,"There is no listed information on this album, which makes me think its a cheap Euro bookleg copy, or live concert. I hate the lack of attention to detail that we are presented with here, as though jazz fans buy without getting information on current releases.. jb"
3,Not the Rippingtons Russ!!!,With regard to the previous reviewer please be aware that this is Russ Freeman the pianist NOT Russ Freeman the guitarist and leader of the Rippingtons. I believe Amazon need to separate the 2 into different pages but there you go.I have not heard this CD so my rating is irrelevant but thought you might need a heads up in view of potential confusion. Go for the new Rippingtons album Wild Card - great stuff.
3,there are better,"as other's have said, i too admire sarah's commitment to veganism, but, wow, there are so many other cookbooks out there that do a better job. i have owned this book for at least a year and i rarley use it. when i do, it is for one super easy vegan chocolate cake recipe (but i have since found better recipes elsewhere). i guess i just really appreciate cookbook authors that use more creativity and come up with recipes themselves. dreena burton's cookbooks are better by far and so is isa's vegan with a vengence. i am presently awaiting the arrival of veganomicon in the mail and know it will blow this one out of the water!"
3,"If you aren't vegan or don't have a lot of special vegan foods, this might not be for you.","The author is really sweet and she has a LOT of recipes. The only problem (which is more on my end) is that I'm not vegan; I just have a lot of stomach issues and vegan food helps in some cases. So I didn't have all the ingredients she needed for her recipes (and I stock a lot of ingredients at my place..), and a lot of her recipes have a high number of them. But the recipes are easy to follow and she has a nice selection.In summary: best if you are a vegan, somewhat helpful if otherwise."
3,Talk about self-aggrandizing,"The recipes are great, as usual, but the photography in this book made me so annoyed, I gave it to my mother."
5,How cool is this!,"Entertaining, cute graphics and photos. Perfect for someone young (or just plain COOL) first going out on their own. Good cooking tips - ie, kitchen emergencies, cleaning, and at the back of the book, how to make creative non-food items like magnets, tshirts, pillows."
2,Basically a compilation of recipes from other people,"I was really excited to get this cookbook, but I was disappointed after looking through it. It has some good recipes (the banana bars are the best), but I think the author actually only provided a few of them. It seems like half of the recipes (or more) came from someone in Florida named 'Wolffie'. I recommend 'Vegan With a Vengeance' instead."
5,All Vegans should have this book,"Sarah Kramer is one of my favorite vegan cookbook authors ever. Her books are so user friendly and would be great for a beginner. The back of the book has a wonderful index. Example: You can look up Butternut Squash in the index and it will tell you every recipe that has butternut squash in it. Great for when you have veggies, fruit, etc. that you are trying to get rid of. None of her recipes are too out there like some cookbooks. She tells you what you can replace certain ingredients with too. Of her three full sized books this is the one I seem to go to at least once a week. Vegan A Go Go rocks though!"
2,Get over yourself,The lack of editing in this book is painful. The recipes are simple and the amount of pictures of Sarah are just plan tacky. If you just want pictures of Sarah this is the book to get. If you want a good cook book you'll have to keep looking.
2,Dissapointed!,"It kills me to say this but its true, I did find it dissapointing. I loved the previous two books (the first one particuarly) but this one has so many pics that make me cringe and a lot of the recipes are almost identical to ones in previous books. Also there seems to be lots of versions of different things so you might have 3 potato salads recipes for example. I've tried a few recipes from this and they have been lacking on the taste side. Also its true too many are from other people.Go out and buy how it all vegan instead (if you don't have it already).Edited to add: not as bad I thought i've since tried the borscht and the lentil and quinoa stew and they both rock."
4,Welcome to Veganism!,"This was the first book I bought when I stepped into Veganland along with two other cheaper more compact books. While it took about an hour to decide on the other two books, this one jumped out at me from the get-go and introduced me to a new world where becoming vegan wasn't all hard work and having to justify my beliefs and choices.This book, to me, is showing that it can be fun to be vegan. The recipes were more varied than I ever realised when I was a lactovegetarian and as soon as I got home from the bookstore I sifted through the pages with post-its in hand dazzled by all the recipes I wanted to try.So far I have tried a few of the veggie recipes and a muffin recipe and all were top-notch. I can only recommend this book as a new vegan but I highly recommend it for others like me - a new lone vegan in a see of omnivores!"
4,"Love the recipes, no love for the typos","I own all three of Sarah's cookbooks, and I love them ALL. This one is the largest of the three. There are a lot of great options here for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and everything in-between. I also like the little crafty stuff at the end.Everything I've cooked from this book (and the other 3) has turned out fantastic, however, there are a lot of typos. Some are obvious, but some are not. That can be very irritating. I'd like to see her release corrections on her site, but other than that, This is still worth checking out, Vegan or not."
3,Beginner cooks and vegans,"Many years ago, when I first became vegan and there were hardly any cookbooks out there for us, I thought this book was the best thing since sliced bread. Now, almost a decade later I rarely, if ever crack the cover. Don't get me wrong, I am glad I own it, but it is for beginner cooks, and beginner vegans (as is the entire 3 book series)."
2,Irritating pictures ruin this for me.,When I first purchased this in 05' I made a few of the recipes. They turned out decent but nothing blew me away and I moved on to other cookbooks.Fast forward a few years. I'm sure there are decent recipes (especially for new vegans) but - every time I try to pick up this cookbook to give it a whirl I get disgusted by the overabundance of unrelated pics of the author and put it down.
1,Find another Sudoku game,"First of all, I love Sudoku. I play it on line, I play in the newspaper, and I play it in books. But this little pest of a device is too hard to use. It has a terrible user interface (and I work at a high technology company - so I am used to technical interfaces and things being hard).Stay away from this one and find another on Amazon instead. Or get a good book like this one:Will Shortz Presents The Little Black Book of Sudoku: 400 Puzzles (Will Shortz Presents...)"
2,Sudoku,This was not very convenient to use. The screen was very dark and moving around the puzzle was more of a hassle then it was worth.
1,bad,"this is the worst product. to much xtra gizmo time date alarm, the screen is not very sensitive. you have to hit it hard w pencil i do not recommend this it is a rip off!!!!"
1,instructions incomprehensible - too complicated,"I bought this Model YD-638 Sudoku game on-line (not from amazon)for my wife's anniversary gift, after a review in AAA VIA magazine. She is a sharp computer geek, and Sudoku fan/""addict""/expert, and gave up after a half-hour. Instructions are so ""foreign-product typical"" - poor translation of Chinese to multi-page, terrible English. This is a piece of junk. I've emailed for a send-it-back refund. There must be an acceptable unit out there somewhere, would appreciate any input on a good model to buy."
4,Some things just don't change!,"Had some previous knowledge of the St. Louis.Tried a sample and decided to learn the whole story.Have read quite a few books on the subject of the Jews and the second world war.This book was just another piece of the puzzle. This book just added to my feelings that the entire world couldn't have cared less if the Jews were totally eliminated from the planet.How average Europeans could just turn away from what was happening was mind boggling.FDR that wonderful icon and some of his closest advisors didn't differ that much from their European counterparts.Well documented and fair, the book showed not only the Jews plight, but what the situation can do to how people think and react in horrible situations.Ron AltschulerNew York"
5,great alphabet cartridge,the alphabets are really cute and versatile for all occasions. i used it for a 1st birthday party and plan to use it again for other projects like cards and scrapbook pages.
2,missing numbers...,this could be a great cartridge if it had the numbers 9 & 0....but they don't! how could they do that? And I needed it the first time I used it. How sad.
4,solid toy rifle,"My son was delighted with his new rifle at Christmas time! This gun was delivered in a timely fashion, and the quality did not disappoint us. My son re-enacts the civil war outside using it !!!"
3,5 Stars only for the Original Version.,"This manic album was issued in 1990 via NB Records [029]. This version from the Austrian band has NOT got inexplicably The 'Split' Lp with [Disharmonic O] & Extreme Deformity EP. The decision by NB to keep them off this time is bizarre, as the tracks serve as the foundation of the group. The Album cover is also different from the Original.Basically this means that you the Pungent Stench fan are losing 10 Tracks, from the Original CD. though very RAW still amazing. However i do beleive you can buy 'Praise the Names of the Musical Assasins' a CD with all the missing stuff + more seperatly..[Makes Good Buisness sense NB!]Still, For God Your Soul... is an interesting take on grind with the obvious gore/death tendencies at max strenght.'Suspended Animation' is the best track on here by miles."
1,Move on to the next book your list.,"The writing was just bad. The author may be a veteran of the NYPD, but he is just not a convincing writer. A lot of the word choice was inappropriate. The writing struck me as forced. The plot, particularly the ending, was wholly unbelievable. There are better books out there. Give this one a miss."
2,half good,"I really like cop novels and authors like Ed Dee and John Mackie. Understood Caunitz to beof this standard. Seems Caunitz died while this novel was not finished. This novel is halfgood, the first half. The second half of this novel introduces a new character every two pagesand it gets more and more involved. All of the personality is lost amid this confusing drugfiasco until we give up - exhausted."
2,"could be called ""everybody dies""","I must agree with Ikvley from CT. There are too many unbelievable plot elements. Such as, a half-black, half-italian, blond, dreadlocked ""undercover"" cop who drives a blue cab? Could he get any more distinctive or stand out any more?Also, how does the mafia boss blackmail the deputy commissioner? By threatening to tell that she has withheld evidence that would send him to prison?"
1,My God this book was horrible!!,"I picked up this book on a discount rack, but I should have left it there. I could barely read this junk. The plot had potential, but the dialogue was terrible and I never really cared about the two main characters. A waste of my time."
5,GREAT backdrops!,"I bought 3 of these backdrops in Azure, Cinnamon and Twilight. I like them alot. If you look at the images for these mine are the two child shots. I bought 5 feet of white baseboard and clamped it to the bottom of the backdrop and I was set. They are a nice weight and photograph well. The blue shows up a tad lighter in the picture then it actually is but thats because I had quite a lot of light coming in. I expect these to be great for Senior headshots as well."
5,see you in 2010,"It seems like every four or so years and just about the time you're ready to give up on Mr. Smith and whatever merry band he's calling the Fall, he manages to unleash a corker that makes you realize anew why the Fall are so great.Here's the latest Great Fall Lp.After floundering around for a while with various combos of young snipes who didn't quite seem up to the task of being the Fall, Smith seems to have whipped a few into proper shape. The music has an energy and vitality and vitriol that Mr. Smith hasn't shown in quite a while.This is one of those absolutely necessary Fall albums."
4,A Good Record But Somewhat of a Letdown.....,Sparta FC is about as good a post punk-like song as you can get and Mountain Energie is great but the rest of the songs are nothing special at least by Fall standards... This is one of those records that I just wanted to like a lot more than I can honestly say that I do and for the first time I found myself feeling like the inconsistent band line-up is the main reason... If I were new to The Fall I'd probably had run out and bought all their stuff after hearing COTC but since I already own all their other stuff this one just doesn't quite measure up.....
5,Still the band by which all others must be judged,"Their strongest album in years. Smith's ability to maintain ""the Fall sound"" despite notoriously persistent change-over in band personnel is unparalleled in the history of recorded music (with the possible exception of Anton Webern). More importantly, he seems here to've reined in his consumption of alcohol, such that his voice rings out as commandingly as in days of old. Signed, The Fish"
3,This author lacks English skills,"Eisenberg needs to learn the proper use of the contraction ""it's."" She frequently uses the phrase ""What It's Important to Know"" over her sub-headings. She needs to change this to ""It is important to know this,"" or ""What is important to know."" ""It's"" important to the English language."
1,Large Women Do Not Read!!!,"I hated this book. I read it during my first pregnancy and it took me awhile to figure out why I hated it so much. The authors seem to have such a problem with large women. There are so many seemingly innocent, but really snide and insulting comments about weight and diet. Their emphasis on the Best Odds Diet is absurd and the Diet isn't that great either. It seems very old fashioned. Also in general the authors don't seem to have much scientific backing for many of their statements about all topics. Also, their know-it-all condescending tone is really a turn off after a few chapters. I actually refer to the authors as ""those skinny b*****s and the book as ""the skinny b*****s' book""I think What to Expect the First Year is even worst. There is just no proof or justification for most of the statements they make. And their know it all attitude is even more obvious."
2,I read half the book and put it up!,"I am expecting my first child and purchased this book b/c it's well-known among expectant mothers. I began reading this book and it terrified me! It does not tell of the joys that you will experience as an expectant mother, but of the horrifying things that could happen to you and your unborn child! I began reading Your Pregnancy Week by Week, which is wonderfully written and takes expectant moms' feelings into careful consideration. If you are a first time mom like me, I don't advise investing the time or money in this book, no matter what your friends say."
1,I can't tell you how much I loathed this book!,"On a friend's recommendation, I purchased this book while pregnant with our first child. I must say how banal and condescending I thought the tone of the book was. I found that the tone of the book and the quality of the writing bordered on the insulting. It's like a pregancy guide written for the absoloute lowest common denominator...as if no one reading the book would have finished the seventh grade. Bleck! Honestly, the writers put forth information as if everyone picking up this book hasn't bothered to pick up a pamphlet in their doctor's office and has never ever bothered to crack open another book. Furthermore, their nutrition and recipie section is completely out of whack. Let's jut say every other publication that I read during my preganacy was more helpful and better written than this one. And as an added bonus, no other book available assumes that the reader has an I.Q. lower than their shoe size. Do yourself a favor and skip this garbage."
1,Dangerously Misleading,"This book is a wonderful example of what's wrong with childbirth in this country -- the pregnant woman is expected to be a passive, compliant patient, trusting her doctor to have all the right answers. The truth is that the only person who cares enough about your unborn child to make the right decisions is you (and your partner)and this book will NOT help you make good decisions. This book will help you be a good patient, like there is something wrong with you and only the expert doctor can fix you. Save your money, save your birth, save your baby. Buy something like Henci Goer's ""The Thinking Woman's Guide to A Better Birth"" and find out what you really should expect while you're expecting! If you are interested in what's happening with your baby developmentally, there are lots of great picture books out there that don't have the underlying message that you are in danger by being pregnant. I'm glad I bought this used and didn't waste a lot of money on it."
1,hated this book,"I can't imagine why this book is viewed as a standard for every pregnant woman. It is stuffed with each possible negative scenario. I don't want to think like an obstetrician, aware of every remotely possible complication.I want a healthy outlook. Let's face it, pregnancy is a sign of overall health and should be treated as such. Ban the scary texts! If I have a specific risk, the multitude of tests I undergo at the doc's should reveal it. Otherwise, the female body is evolved to birth. It is our most biologically important function & we are well equipped to take on the task.Since I received 3 of these as gifts, I read through a copy and found contradictions in information from one page to another. Sorry I don't remember specifics since I've had two boys since then, but it made the info appear so untrustworthy that I threw them all in the recycle instead of giving them to the next mom as I do with everything else."
5,The Mommy Bible,"This is a WONDERFUL book! My husband got it for me with our first baby, and what a life saver it was. I brought it with me wherever I went. Anytime I felt anything strange, I would look it up in this book and there was my answer. Now we are expecting our second baby and I'm using it again. It's a great book for rookie parents or experienced ones. I highley recommend it. It's also great if the hubbies read it, they get to know what we are going through better and can help us along the way."
2,Too Basic,The books cover the basics of what happens when you are expecting a baby. It doesn't teach you more than what your mother could tell you during a coffee break. It's really a waste of time unless you don't have a mother or other previously pregnant friend to talk to.
1,Skip this book,"I bought this during my first pregnancy and really regretted it! It has a thoroughly negative outlook on pregnancy and birth (i.e. what 'could' go wrong)This book gave me the feeling I would have lots of (unneccesary) interventions- IV, episiotomy, epidural,etc. in birth.This is the perfect hypochondriac's directory --you think you have all the ailments described in the book after reading about all the very commonplace symptoms fo pregnany. This book doesn't begin to address natural childbirth or complementary healthcare. Buy ""Gentle Birth Choices"" by Barbara Harper and ""The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding"" by LLL and anything by Sheila Kitzinger for a much more postive view of pregnancy and birth."
3,It's not all it's cracked up to be!,"I bought this book because I kept hearing about how GREAT it was and how informative it was, but I found it to be kind of boring. It's suppose to go by how many weeks/months along you are, and tell you what to expect, but I found it to kind of jump from question to question, not focusing on certain topics. I can't return the book, but I might sell it!"
2,I agree with Closis ...,"I also believe that ""Girlfriends guide"" and ""Babytales"" as well as the "" The Baby book"" are better choices. Who do they think they are talking to their readers like we are stupid. Not to mention most of us are scared Our first time around and ""what to expect when expecting"" does everything in its power to make us feel worst. What I'm expecting when I'm expecting is not to buy or recieve this book."
2,Very depressing.,"Heaven forbid that a woman actually enjoys her pregnancy. The women who wrote this book presented the information in an ""alarmist"" format--not very pleasing. Only use this book as a reference guide. Otherwise, live your pregnancy in a plastic bubble!!"
1,A waste of paper,"This book is unimaginative, uninformative, patronising, repetitive and boring. While reading this book, you could be forgiven for forgetting that you are reading about the most amazing thing in life. The instruction manual to our fax machine makes a better read. There are far better books, look around!"
1,Not for Attachment or Contimuum parenting families!!,"This book is for conventional parents - parents who think artificial feeding and breastfeeding are one in the same, who think extended breastfeeding is distasteful and a minipulation of a mother by her nursling, and parents who believe it is OK to let a baby cry herself to sleep in an isolated crib down the hall. These authors actually state (in so many words) that breastmilk is basically useless after one year, and that sleeping with your infant in a family bed is not desirable. If you want a better guide for instinctual parenting from the heart, read ""The Continuum Concept"" by Jan Leidloff, or ""Attachment Parenting"" by Katie Allison Granju."
2,Condescending,"I was told this was THE book to get if you were expecting. I'm only 6 weeks along and already have grown very tired of this book and it's condescending tone. There is some useful information and that is why I gave it 2 stars, but nothing you couldn't find in a much better book (I prefer the Mayo Clinic book) or somewhere online. I have had some morning sickness, but my biggest problem has been terrible heartburn. I referenced this book to see if there were any suggestions for heartburn, and it basically told me that the heartburn was all my fault for overindulging in fried and fatty foods. Yeah, right! At this point the only thing I can keep down is oatmeal and plain toast. Since when are those overindulgences?! The Mayo Clinic book on the other hand, explains that heartburn is a very common side effect due to hormones and gives sound advice."
3,Worst Case Scenerio Handbook,"While this book is very informative and an excellent resource, I would not recommend sitting down and reading it cover to cover like I did. Being a first time mom when I picked this one up I was already afraid of every little thing that could possibly go wrong. This book really helped me along in my paranoia, and my husband eventually threw it away. There are actually sections in this book with a disclaimer that says if you do not have this condition do not read this chapter, it will only freak you out. If you have a specific question or do face a challenge during your pregnancy this book is very informative and helpful, but for your own sanity do not read any more of it than you have to!"
3,"I read it, but I had to practice self control!","It is a great source of information, but also a great source of paranoia. I only recommend this book to women who are hard headed (or can just pick the right information & omit the ones that are too exaggerated), or those who already ahve been through this before but are brushing up on their info.I tried to practice self control and not fall in the trap of fear. I must admit though that the last 2 months of my pregnancy, I stopped reading it, cause I couldn't deal with it any longer."
2,Pessamists Beware,"I agree with Ron's posting that this book, while informative, definately supports the phrase ""a little knowledge is a dangerous thing"". To be honest I found ""The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy"" much more supportive of my actual experience.This book is a good resource if used in conjunction with OB/GYN visits, to stimulate conversation and assist in asking questions that you may not think to ask. However, if you are even slightly given to assuming the worst case, I would steer clear and enjoy your pregnancy as it unfolds."
1,Not what I expected while expecting!,"As a first time parent I was looking for something informative and to help me understand what my body was going through. As this book has lots of information, I felt that it did not give me all of the information I needed and expected. I guess it was the format of the book that I did not like. I was looking for a book that gave me more information on the development of the baby etc. This book I felt focused on the negative issues.....things that could go wrong. In short it wasn't what I expected while I was expecting....So I found other resourses that gave me the information I needed."
1,This book is a guilt trip!,"Unless you are willing to follow the very strict diet and exercise guidelines in this book, you shouldn't buy it. Even if you are willing to follow it, the advice is so unrealistic that most women who are pregnant will not be able to follow it because they will just feel too lousy. It really will just make you feel guilty and frustrated, which pregnant women really don't need. The medical information is very general, and was of little help to me during my pregnancy. Anything that I really wanted information on, I had to look up on the Internet. The only really valuable part of the book is the information on fetal development each month, and some of the information on how chemicals and certain foods affect the baby, which you could probably find on-line too. ""What to Expect the First Year"" is similarly strict and frustrating, and in some ways even insulting as to the advice it gives. Fortunately, I received both books as gifts and didn't waste my own money on them."
2,Too basic,"After hearing so much about this book, I was so excited to receive it as a gift when I found out I was pregnant. But the content is very weak, and the ""Question & Answer"" format condescending and annoying. I found ""The Unofficial Guide ..."" and ""Advice from a Pregnant OB"" much more intelligent reading. I would not even recommend this as a backup book, except for someone who wants some very light reading, and doesn`t like an academic, purer approach and will appreciate the Q&As.I was very surprised that this is ""the bible"" for pregnancies -- it really makes you wonder."
2,GUILTY!,"At first, I started to read this book cover to cover, but it quickly got put on the shelf and only came out when I had some kind of weird pregnancy symptom!I felt like every time I read the book I found I was doing something ""wrong"" and that I was harming the baby in some way.My daughter is now nine months old and she is a beautiful,healthy baby and I didn't even follow the Best Odds diet!Like I said, use it for a reference, but don't read it and feel guilty like I did!"
2,Definitely should NOT be the only book on your nightstand!,"This book is fine if all you want to do is keep up with the basics of a pregnancy, but it shouldn't be your only book. I found it to be too harsh & unrealistic (how many women actually enjoy eating wheat germ?), and gives the impression that if you don't follow their instructions exactly, bad things will happen! Considering most of their instructions were off-base, I suppose most of us were asking for trouble with anything we did? If you want a realistic book, pick up Dr. Sears' ""The Pregnancy Book"" (no, I'm not a huge, rabid fan of Dr. Sears, but I do think the book is not a 'know-it-all' style of book!)"
4,Good reference guide,I found the best way to use this book is as a reference guide. It does not give the best week-by-week or month-by-month descriptions. It's geared toward question/answer format. I would not read it cover to cover but have used it as a reference guide to research topics. It gives thorough and accurate explanations about medical conditions and tips on when to call your Dr. but I wouldn't want to read about all those problems if I weren't experiencing symptoms.
2,Very biased and basic info you can get at your monthly exams,"I found this book to cover most normal pregnancies, but I found myself constantly afraid of premature labor every other day with their ""When to call your doctor"" sections. They obviously are a pro-hospital birth book and I do not recall home birth being mentioned in a good light. And, if you aren't going to breastfeed, well then you may as well prepare for a sickly child according to their stance. I also found it a little old-fashioned since there are a lot of single mothers out there that this book constantly reminds them of their singularity."
3,"Too preachy, but useful guide.","As long as you ignore the eating plan, it's a good book for an idea of what's happening each month."
3,Lot of information. Not very personal.,"I am six months into my pregnancy and have been reading many books. What to Expect has lots of information and seems to have an answer to every question imagineable. I have found it to be very useful. However, I can relate better to a book like We're Pregnant! that gives lots of information but from a more personal viewpoint. My goal has been to find a book that gives a very detailed accounting of the delivery process - What to Expect answers questions relating to the delivery but again, I preferred the more detailed, true-to-life description in We're Pregnant! Still, I would recommend What to Expect as a good reference book."
2,Too negative,"Definitely include this book in your pregnancy library, but read it with a grain of salt. It provides plenty of useful information, but it will also scare you out of your wits if you take it too seriously. For levity, read the Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy by Vicky Iovine. There are lots of other informative books that are more positive and respect your ability to think and make choices other than what the author thinks is right."
3,Lots of information; could be a little more positive,"I read What to Expect when I was pregnant for the first time. While I thought it contained a great deal of information, there seemed to be an emphasis on all the things that could go wrong. I wanted to be informed, but not knowing myself what to expect, I would have preferred more focus on the positive aspects of pregnancy. Still, this book is great if you have a question on a certain topic - it seems to cover them all. I would have liked the book much better if it were more personal."
3,Pretty good but I'm sure I could find better.,"I bought this book before any other based on all the hoopla I had heard before I was pregnant. Although I found all the Q & A's very helpful, I was not impressed with The Best Odds Diet. The book made me feel like a horrible person just because I ate healthy all day, but may have snacked on a piece of chocolate or something. Although it taught me a lot on what I should be eating, I have also never been so paranoid about my diet in my life! What I really found lacking was what was going on in my body. For each month, there was a small chart on what to expect and a 2 sentence explanation on how my baby was growing. I want to know specifically what is going on in my body step by step. This is the reason I am going to buy a week-by-week book that has been recommended by several others. Since this is my first baby, any information I can get is great, but I've been told there's much better books out there."
2,Too much of a worse case scenerio book for me,"This book always seemed to give the worst case scenerio about my questions about pregnancy. For example it said that I shouldn't go camping up in the mountains when my doctor said it was fine. It made me paranoid about how often my baby hiccuped and said that she could be strangling herself on her umbilical cord if she did it too often, when my doctor assured me hiccups are good and mean the baby is practicing breathing. There are many more examples, but it did not make me a relaxed pregnant woman about normal occurances during pregnancy. It is very clinical and not human enough for my taste. I much preferred ""The Pregnancy Book"" by Martha and Dr Sears to this one and if I had to recommend one pregnancy book (I ended up buying many)it would not be the ""What to Expect"" series. Save your money and your sanity and pass on this book."
1,Misleading - Pro Cesarean Birth,"Even though this book is well organized and easy to read with its month by month format, I found it to be a bit misleading as it does not give risks, side affects and alternatives to many medical procedures and medications. It encourages kind of a wait and see attitute instead of providing all the information so that informed parents can make informed decisions as they make plans for their birth. Perhaps a better name for this book would be Expecting...Expect a Ceserean. Birth is a normal, natural event in a women's life in most cases - not a surgical procedure. A bit misleading and somewhat irresponsible."
2,Did not live up to it's reputation,"I rushed out and bought this book the day I found out I was pregnant because it has a good reputation. Once I got it home and started into it, I found it to be uninteresting and not a good preparation for the coming months. The authors focused way too much on diet- which during your first trimester when morning sickness runs rampant, diet advice is not what you need. Also, there was a lot of ""what if this happens.."" and moms-to-be do not need more things to worry about. There are far better books out there for pregnant women who don't want to worry about everything for 9 months."
3,What to Expect When You're Expecting,"I just found out I was pregnant and bought this book by recommendation. While I found a lot of information therin, I do not love the format. I bought some other pregnancy books that were easier reads. I want to comment on those who are upset about this book because they got scared reading about potential complications of a pregnancy. People who get scared about facts need to work on themselves. Facts are just facts. This books is not a novel. It is not supposed to make you feel happy, sad, fearful or confident about your pregnancy. It is supposed to provide some information you do not already have. I believe What to Expect does what it's supposed to do."
1,Please don't buy this book,This book is preachy and filled with biased notions of what women should do during pregnancy and childbirth. It's condescending.A much better book is Henci Goer's The Thinking Woman's Guide to Better Birth!
1,skip it,"I don't understand why this book is so popular. I found the health and well-being information lacking. There is also an abundance of ""scary"" information each month - ""things you should worry about"" that frankly, dont apply to 95% of us and I just don't need to know. I found the Pregnancy book by Dr. Sears MUCH better - more informative, more helpful, and more realistic. Of course, I also loved the Girlfriend's Guide - it's great for a laugh."
1,can i give it zero stars?,"Amazon won't allow zero stars it turns out, but that is what this book deserves.When your midwife tells you to throw the book out, then you know it's a bad book. I won't even give it away. This and its companion of what to eat when expecting need to be gotten rid of. This book is a large volume of anxiety and unless you want to be freaked out during your pregnancy, avoid it like the plague. I have no idea how it gets re-published, why it is even in print to begin with. The woman is no authority but acts like she is some sort of expert with a preachy tone and inaccurate information.Please, do yourself and your loved ones, and your future baby a favor and read anything written by Dr. Sears. Even Jill Iovine's Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy is way better and entertaining too."
4,Too much information,"This is my first pregnancy at 36 years old. A friend of mine let me borrow this book after I'd already read a whole bunch of Your Pregnancy Week by Week. I like that one much better. I found it an easier read. What to Expect When You're Expecting, is good but the picture of the pregnant lady on the front of this version is scary. This is the one I was lent. She looks tired and sad. I hate that! It make me feel like I will be tired and sad if I read it. I guess they thought she looked peaceful, but I think she is sorry and sad. Too much information for me. I guess I'd already found so much on the Internet and from reading the Week by Week book that I felt like I was having to read too many things that didn't pertain to me. It's organized that way to include all possibilities within each week."
1,Insulting to educated mothers-to-be,"A couple people (new parents) actually recommended this book when I found out I was pregnant, but thankfully, it was a waste of my time. Unless you know NOTHING about pregnancy and common-sense nutrition, this book will only list 50,000 questions and outdated answers in a weird format instead of actually teaching you anything.Also avoid this book if you plan on doing a natural home birth.I will be so happy when this is no longer considered the Be All End All Pregnancy Handbook.I recommend, instead, The Whole Pregnancy Handbook : An Obstetrician's Guide to Integrating Conventional and Alternative Medicine Before, During, and After Pregnancy by Joel Evans and Robin Aronson; and Special Delivery by Rahima Baldwin, if you're considering home birth."
1,this book depressed me,"I am a pediatrician and expecting my 2nd child. The diet advice in this book is so preachy. When you're sick and or in the throes of a craving the last thing you worry about is sticking to a rigid diet. This book actually made me feel depressed because I ate some McDonald's this morning. If I didn't know better because I am a physician, I would be very fearful that I am harming my baby (which I am NOT). In the edition I have, the one before this one, they actually recommend that a husband signal to his wife if she orders something ""unhealthy"" in a restaurant. I would hit my husband with a fork if he did such a thing! (not really, but he would regret it.) I sincerely hope they removed this advice from the current addition. The Girlfriend's guide by Vicki Iovine gave me a good laugh and made me feel a lot better about my dietary indiscretions.."
1,Unnecessarily Upsetting!,"I found this book to be full of impossible and sometimes ridiculous standards that no normal woman could meet. It also has far too much negative and scary information that was just plain upsetting. After three months of anxiety about my pregnancy I mentioned to my doctor how troubling the information in this book was to me. She (also pregnant) agreed completely and added that no doctor in their large practice felt it was a good reference for pregnancy. She advised me to get rid of it, which I did as soon as I got home. I never thought I would destroy a book, but I gained much relief as each page of ""What To Expect While You're Expecting"" curled into flames! Don't read this book if you have even the slightest anxiety about your pregnancy!"
4,Watch out for pre-eclampsia,"This is the bible for moms- and dads-to-be, and I agree with almost everything positive said in each of the hundreds of reviews here. However, I want to point out to expectant mothers and their mates that pre-eclampsia - a dangerous and surprisingly common condition that befalls pregnant women - is woefully under-emphasized in this text. The book adequately deals with the disease and even lists key facts (including how shockingly common it is), but it does not sound the alarms like it should. Up to 10 percent of first-time moms get pre-eclampsia; my wife did; and it can be a real shock to the system if you've never heard of it and aren't prepared for it."
3,"Helpful, but ...","This is the first book I bought when I found out we were pregnant with our first baby. However, I am in my eighth week, and I am finding that I don't like the book as much as I thought because it goes by months instead of weeks. It also seems like the book is two doctor's appointments ahead of what I've actually had, so I find that it's not as helpful as I first thought it would be. It also seems to jump around a lot."
2,"Historically speaking, this is insightful",but it needs to be updated. Seems alot of the nutrional guidelines and exercises could be expanded. It is an easy read.
4,Great! Not much on C-Section tho.,"Great book! Really Helped me thru nine months of pregnancy and my doctor probably loved it too since I called less frequently than I might if I hadn't had this book. ;-) But, what little information I had abut emergency C-Section did come from this book, yet I was still COMPLETELY unprepared for it. Info on C-section was a little TOO clinical. Like the other sections, a bit about ""how it feels, how you feel, etc"" would have been helpful. Additionally, saying ""you can sit, but your tummy hurts"" is the only difference between vaginal and c-section delivery is VERY false and misleading. Assuming that the majority of readers don't need that information is also false. There is other information in the book that is less common, yet addressed more thoroughly. That was very disappointing so I would not recomened the chapter onpost-partum to anyone who might have a c-section."
5,The only pregnacy book to read!!!,"I loved this book for all those inbetween visit questions this is the book to go to. Anything and everything is in this book. The way the book is layed out my husband thought it was a delight everything was easy to find. I love it so much before my baby was born I bought ""What to Expect the First Year"" and I'm planning on buying the next one too!!!!"
5,every mom to be needs this book,"This was the only book my friends and family told me I needed. They were right. Every question is answered in this book. It tells you what to expect every month, and is correct. It also includes postpardom and complications. The next book you will need is ""What to Expect the First Year""."
2,there's better stuff out there,"I bought this book used for very little money and I think that's the only reason why I didn't return it. First time pregnant, I was pretty disappointed with this book. It's not fun to read and the information barely ever fit to my questions I had.There are better books and better information out there - save your money."
4,I didn't find it negative or scary...,"I recieved this book as a gift from my mother in-law because I am expecting my first child. Some other reviewers have stated that they found it negative, and that all the information is meant to scare you. Well I did not find that to be the case. I agree that it does describe a lot of different and sometimes very rare pregnancy complications, most of which no one will experience. However, I took that as comforting to know that if I did have any of the weird symtoms that it was probably normal, and NOT a reason to think something was wrong. (I was having nosebleeds every morning but the book said that it is very common) It is a little simplistic though. I would prefer something that came from more of a medical perspective. This book comes off as more ""friendly advice""."
3,Save your money,"I bought this book with my first pregnancy, since it was recommended by my OB at the time, and since I'd heard it touted as THE essential pregnancy book to read. I found a lot of the information in the book to be incredibly frightening, and just stressed me out even more! The only parts I found to be even somewhat ""reassuring"" where the sections that tell how big the baby is and what is developing. However, like I said earlier, if you want to be scared to death over what can go wrong then you might just want to pick this book up anyways. I would not recommend this book to any of my friends or family. I only gave it three stars because it is jam-packed with information. However I did not find much of it to be of use. If you want a good pregnancy book, there are plenty of others out there, as some of the other reviewers suggested. Despite its popularity, though, I do not think ""What to Expect"" is one of them. If you must read it, borrow it from the library or a friend-save your money."
5,Great Reference Guide,Good book to calm your worries. A go-to guide for pregnancy. Highly recommended addition to your baby book collection.
3,Good but not as expected,"The book is not as I expected, I heard alot about it therefore I thought it was much more than that. It's a good one though, I give it a 3."
1,A Pregnancy Reference Book,"Whatever you do, don't read it cover to cover. You'll be paralyzed with fear. However, it's good when you feel a pain, or have a rash, or anything else that makes you panic, because you can easily find your symptom, and see the benign problems that could be causing it. However, it also mentions several terrifying conditions that have that symptom, so be sure to keep in mind that it mentions many incredibly rare diseases."
2,Not worth it.,"I read this book and found it mediocre at best. I don't even have any kids and I already knew everything in it. It covers basics that I consider to be common sense. I could have just talked with any mother (or a decent doctor) for half an hour to cover everything in the book, it's practically useless unless you are absolutely clueless and don't know anyone who has had a child that you can talk with."
3,Haven't read this book since baby #1,"When we were pregnant with our first, we went and purchased what seems like a truckload of books on pregnancy- books for moms, books for dads, books for both, etc. I wasn't disappointed with this book, as it does provide a lot of information, but I haven't looked at it since our first baby. We are now on baby #3 and the books that I still refer to are ""Your Pregnancy Week by Week"" and ""The Girfriend's Guide to Pregnancy"". These two combined provide the same basic info as WTEWYE, but also provide more information on mom (TGGTP) and on the weekly growth of baby (YPWBW). I wouldn't necessarily NOT get ""What to Expect..."", as it does have a lot of information in it, but the nature of most of its info is such that the book is non-essential for rounds 2 and above."
2,"Poor information source, aweful format and writing.","I bought this book for my then-expecting wife about two years ago. At first, I thought the book was ""OK."" But as time passed and I perused through it, I realized that most of the information is in ""bits"" with little substance and the depth is lacking. It looks more like a compilation of obstetricians' scientific journal articles than a real guide for pregnancy. Then there's the seeming condescending and feel-good voice of the authors. One thing is trying to be sensitive to the expectant mother another is to patronize her. I have no idea how has this book become so well known, but I really discourage anyone from spending their money in this primer. I highly suggest getting a different book. A real book, not this patchwork."
2,pregnant are not perfect,"It seems as if the author expects every pregnant woman to abide by strict standards in order to have a healthy baby. Yes, if a woman is carrying a baby, she should be extra careful, but this is ridiculous. Women have odd cravings sometimes, and sometimes, they can only keep down certain foods, even if those foods are not completely healthy. This book made me very stressed out while I was pregnant. She made me feel as if I was going to have a deformed child if I did not adhere to a strict diet. But, thank you, my son was perfectly healthy, and my diet was less than perfect. If you must get this book, buy it used or borrow it."
1,This book is horrible!,"It is insulting to any woman with the ability to think for herself. Between the patronizing 'doctor knows best' tone and the advice that you should measure your thighs when you find out you're pregnant so you can make sure they don't expand - it's ridiculous. It hardly addresses any other birthing options, aside from medicated hospital births. Anything outside of the norm is regarded as dangerous to the mother and the baby.This is a horribly disgusting book that does nothing more than scare or guilt a newly expectant mother into submission."
1,The worst pregnancy prep book,I am a doula and I always get worried when someone tells me they are reading this book. It makes you afraid of being pregnant. The diet they ask you to follow is nearly impossible. I think this book makes you fearful and guilty. I highly recommend Dr. Sears' books on pregnancy and childbirth
1,expect the worst,"This book focuses on basic info, which may be helpful if you are completely clueless about pregnancy, and then focuses on all the probelms that might occur at each stage.The author is also opinionated and critical of diets. Her healthy pregnancy diet recomendations would make almost any woman (pregnant or not) toss the book across the room. I think the title is so catchy and that is why it sells so well. There are many other books which are more informative and more positive as well.I personally liked, ""Pregnancy, Childbirth, and the Newborn, Revised and Updated : The Complete Guide"" by Penny Simkin."
1,A wretched book,"This book does little but defend the medical community in the United States, and scare the living _______ out of expecting mothers. It leaves out very important information about how labor and delivery work physically, thus its explanations of why things are done--like encouraging women to lie on their backs during delivery--are utterly incomplete. They say it's easier for the doctors, failing to mention that it also literally impedes pelvic and tailbone movement, narrowing the the birth canal and making delivery harder. Very incomplete, very medical-oriented, and full of what to be afraid of, rather than what to expect."
1,Confusing!,"The month by month format of this book is of no help. My OB (as most do) calculates by weeks. Also, they start their OB visits at month 1-I did not see my OB until week 9 which is pretty normal-so which OB visit applys when?This book assumes you have a perfect body and perfect pregnancy: it does not have a basis in reality for most women.Buy something else."
1,"Nice Resource, But EXTREMELY Flawed","Pregnancy and Birth are completely natural. This book treats you like a patient instead of a woman. While this book mentions most everything that can cause concern in pregnancy, and has symptoms that you can check out, its advice is not very practical or in-depth. It is convenient to refer to for complications and other side effects of pregnancy.The Diet is a joke. The section on morning sickness is a joke. The information on giving birth is sketchy at best. This book is slanted for those who give the responsibility of their care completely into the hands of the doctors instead of for those who want to research everything and find a doctor or midwife who suits them.I shudder at all the reviews that call this the Pregnancy Bible. There are many better books out there that encourage you to be a full participant in your pregnancy care and that describe labor fully so that it is no longer frightening."
2,"Informative, but not reassuring","Although I found this book to be helpful when looking for information about something, I did not find the tone of the book reassuring. Much of it is written in question and answer format, and the majority of the questions have the tone of a mother who is worrying. This format sends the message that panic and constant worry are appropriate responses to pregnancy. Even though worry is certainly a part of being pregnant, I felt that the presuppositon of worry often exacerbated my own worries and was leading me in the direction of worrying excessively - which is easy enough to do in the first place. I give it two stars because it is informative, but would recommend looking for a book with a more reassuring tone."
2,Don't expect too much,"The book is well structured but the information concentrates too much on the mother eating habits. I had the impression I was reading a book about diet. It lacks information about the baby, that's what the pregnancy is about."
2,Too much focus on food...,"I am on my 4th pregnancy, and it was the first book I bought with my first. Definately the ""Best Odds Diet"" is extreme. The author alots you ONE dessert or ""splurge"" per month. And then to ruin the excitement of splurging she tells you to pick something semi nutritious like carrot cake. The book acts like your child will be deficient if you take one bite of anything with sugar, deep fried or salty. Ridiculous!!! I spent the better half of my first pregnancy in fear of eating sweets or processed meats! This diet will ruin any special occasion dinner, vacation or treat.There is some good info in the book, but I wish there was more on the development of the baby. I wish it told you what weeks lined up with the nine months."
5,great book!,"This is my very favorite pregnancy book. I also have the mother of All Pregnancy Books. This book, 'What to Expect' actually did a lot better job of calming my fears than the other book. ""The Mother of All Pregnancy Books' scared me a little more.(but that is still a good book and I am glad I have both) This one assures you that why you need to be careful and wise, that the chances of something bad happening are still pretty low. I don't get that other people think this book makes them paranoid or its negative. I can't figure it out. I guess everyones thinking works differently. Go figure. I do enjoy both of my books and am re-reading them for my third pregnancy. Its nice to have on hand for subsequent pregnancies. I can't imagine being pregnant without this book.Its got a lot of positive and helpful and wise info, and is very encouraging."
2,"Cool drawing, decent reference",Honestly my favorite part of the book is the drawing of the pregnant lady. It's cool to compare the changes in your body!It's also a decent reference tool but not readable month to month. Some articles don't even relate to the month you are in! (?)
3,Not a Parenting Bible...,This book has it's place. It's a quick reference guide and has everything imaginable in it. If used with a good dose of perspective and not read cover-to-cover over and over then you should be fine. This book should be balanced with a good assortment of books that are more balanced and deal with the overall picture of parenting. Something more encouraging and uplifting wouldn't hurt either.Enjoying the Ride
3,Not THE book,"This is the one book I knew I had to have when I found out I was pregnant. I was kinda disappointed. It's almost scary for a first time pregnant woman. It talks about all the things that could be wrong when you're just having normal pregnancy ""things"". Very informative about the possible complications of pregnancy, but it kinda takes away from the joy of being pregnant."
2,This book instills unessessary fear into 1st time moms!,"I finally achieved pregnancy after 3 1/2 years of infertility treatment. I was told this is a must have book so I dug out my copy and read it. I could not believe how fatalistic this book was! It scared the pants off me! Especially when I started experiencing pre-term labor...the impression that I got was that I was surely going to lose my twins, no if's and's or but's! Guess what? I did not lose them and they are healthy 10 month old boys.Oh, and my OB totally did not recommend the best odds diet, especially with being pregnant with twins...she said it was one of the most unhealthy diets for a pregnant woman and should be taken off the market. The caloric intake was inadequate and again, a lot of fear instilled about how bad so many foods were during pregnancy...it made me feel that if I ate 1/2 a cookie in one month, I was going to lose my twins or gain 30 lbs in a day!NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!"
1,What can go wrong when you're expecting...,"Hate is a very strong word, but wow, my wife and I really hated this book. In fact, it breaks what should be the first rule of pregnancy and child rearing books -- do no harm. What to expect, in almost every situation, will give you the disaster scenario of what could be wrong. Cramps? The baby could be kicking or you could have a massive hemorrhage! Feet swelling? Could be normal pregnancy symptoms or you could have blood clots! Seriously, the book drove my wife and I crazy during our first pregnancy. Indeed, it's the only book I've thrown away in recent memory.Pregnancy books should be calming and fun, not scary. We enjoyed the Girl Friends Guide, which was better written, more accessible, and less likely to lead to panic in the middle of the night."
2,"Should be called ""What to EAT when you're expecting""!","This book is so diet-obsessed it is ridiculous. I realize it's important to eat well when you're pregnant, but the authors really do get carried away, making it sound as if eating a hot fudge sundae will irreparably damage your unborn child. There is a lot of helpful information in this book, but it seems like not a page goes by without yet another reference to their totally unrealistic ""Best Odds"" diet. I wanted information about pregnancy, not preaching about what I eat."
2,"First time mom, steer clear","Okay, I think this book is very informative, but Ron Sullivan (his review) is VERY right. This book made me very nervous about every little ache and pain. It seems like they put in every worst-case scenario possible and when you are a first time mom and you read this, of course you are going to panick. When I get pregnant again, I will not be reading this book, it's way too stressful. I'm sure there are many other informative books out there that don't stress you out as much. Oh, and my husband also wanted to burn the book-he was tired of hearing me get worried every day."
5,"I use it EVERYTIME, I'm pregnant.","You'd think after 8 pregnancies, 5 births & 4 healthy children, I could write or quote the book. Nope, I still refer to it everytime I'm pregnant.Ruthie"
1,Skip this old-school pregnancy primer,"This book was one of the many enthusiastic purchases I made in the delighted first days of pregnancy. I knew the book was famous; now I know it to be infamous among parents and doctors alike. At my first OB visit, the nurse gave me an info sheet on recommended pregnancy books; in bold at the bottom it said, ""We do NOT recommend 'What to Expect'"". This was confirmation on the conclusion I had already come to. The book is archaic, both in style and content. The organization is horrendous, and information on frightful contra-indications, etc is strewn throughout. A wonderful alternative is the ""The Pregnancy Bible: Your Complete Guide to Pregnancy and Early Parenthood"". The organization is much better and it features beautiful photos of mom and baby. ""Scary stuff"" is centralized in the back portion of the book, more as a reference than scare tactic."
4,What to Expect When You're Expecting,"Very interesting information yet a bit scary . I also read and listened to The Leclaire Hypnobirthing Bundle for Happy Hypnomoms and Blissful Hypnobabies. Together they gave me all the physiological and factual info plus all the psychological ,bonding and relaxing education that I needed. I let go of all the uneeeded info and focused on the power of my mind and the ease of my body. I found both extremely helpful in very different ways ."
4,Great book!,"I read A LOT of pregnancy books, and let me tell you, this is the best out of all the ones I've come across. This book does a great job of answering most of the questions you will have, and a lot of others you hadn't thought of. I really like how the complications are in their own seperate section- if you don't want to read them, they don't force them on you. In my experience, thats the main flaw of many other books. The eating plan was a little ridculous- skip it.In conclusion, I read a lot of other books, but I kept coming back to this one. No book is ever going to be perfect, but this is definately a must read for any pregnant woman."
2,Don't Waste Your Money(more info on FREE websites),The free book the doctor gave me at my first appointment gave me more useful information than this book(and all the baby websites have more info as well). I didn't see the point in separating each month out. The what to expect this month were basically the same every month. There were questions and answers that should be organized by category not month. I did not read the entire book because I got bored with it but I do not remember any section on single mothers. Some of us are single not by choice and don't like reading about husbands and wives all the time.
3,What to Expect when your Expecting,"I have found as a first time mother that WTEWYE was informative. However, it scared me more than helping me along the way. I became more frightened for my baby then before I read the book."
2,not for me,"The basic information and the organization of this book is OK, but it encourages too much pampering. Like other reviewers, I found it annoying and patronizing. Seems to cater mostly to stay at home suburban moms and moms-to-be, but I have a full time job/career and live in the city. The book needs to get real."
4,I couldn't get enough info!,"During my pregnancy, I was a sponge for knowledge! I thought this book was great, except sometimes it left me with a thirst for more. A wonderful book to accompany it, is ""My Pregnancy, Week by Week""."
4,Excellent book - well worth it,"I got this book when I was about a month pregnant and found it to be a really useful, compassionate, sensible and informative guide all the way through. I don't really understand the negative reviews - it seems to me people are a. immediately assuming just because the book discusses problems in pregnancy that the book is implying that you should be worried about these things, and b. upset because the book doesn't discuss in detail things that come at the end of the pregnancy like breast-feeding and C-sections (this is because it is a book largely about pregnancy!)The only reason that I gave it four stars rather than five was because of the relentless emphasis on their Pregnancy Diet, which I thought was ridiculous. Obviously, you don't want to be eating a lot of junk food through the pregnancy, but the diet they propose is completely unrealistic. Otherwise, I would recommend this book highly!!!"
4,"Good resource, with some reservations","I bought this book because I wanted something that would be a good resource and because I'd heard people rave about it. It was really helpful. I loved the information about what was going on each month as far as the baby's development. And the questions and answers really helped alleviate a lot of my concerns, as well as letting me know when I should think about contacting my doctor.My main complaint about the book was that a lot of the questions seemd to be sort of randomly distributed---what I was experiencing at four months was talked about in the seventh month. I realize every pregnancy is different, but it seemed that it might be better to address things by topic rather than by month.Overall, however, I was very happy with the purchase and would recommend it as one resource in your pregnancy collection."
5,YOU HAVE TO GET THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I got this book from my health insurance company (!) when I became pregnant for the first time. It was a starting point for my research about myself and my then unborn baby. Sufficed to say, I wasted a lot of money on books that weren't nearly as good and reassuring as this one.Simply stated, ""everyone's pregnancy is different"" - this book assured me that I was not a (completely) insane and to ""hang in there"" and ride the storm.I have few negative comments about the book - I'm actually struggling to find one to prove I've actually read it - trust me, though - I have - and you really must!!!I've lent my book out so many times (and never got it back) that I finally just started buying it for friends whenever they said they were pregnant - or even just thinking about it.Seriously though, buy it, read it and good luck with your pregnancy."
4,great book some minor problems,"This is indeed a great book that I think every expecting women should have. It can answer all my questons and concern.Some minor problems: the author says if air gets into your v...it will enter your bloodstream and make you sick, even die. I cannot understand how that happens so I asked my OB, and my OB agreed with me that no way this can happen."
4,full of info-but so heavy at times....,"Anyone who is expecting a baby should have this book on hand. However!!!!For REALLY enjoyable reading about becoming a parent (and lots of laughs) I would highly recommend:""The Girlfriends' Guide to Surviving the First Year of Motherhood"" by Vicki Iovineor""Be Prepared; A Practical Handbook for New Dads"" Both of these books present most of the info you will need in a funny, lighthearted and much more digestible way."
3,Given To Me By My OB/GYN,"My OB/GYN gave this book when I became pregnant, like I think a lot of other doctors do across the country. I think it's kind of the bible for pregnancy. I poured over the book with each new day and feeling. I was interested in everything and this book gave me my fill of information (and more). It started to scare me and I found I was being over sensitive. Once I stopped reading every word, I appreciated it as a reference only. Then I relaxed and took everything in stride.When my son was born then I was given The What to Expect for First Year of Life. I use that as a reference as well - which is just as well as I don't have the same amount of time to read, with a little one."
4,Take what you want,"I found this book very helpful when I was pregnant. I could find an answer to each question I had in mind (as that white fluid in the 4th or 5th month, or that glass of wine that I drank when I didn't know I was pregnant or what cerclage is). I liked also the way it explains each stage of the pregnancy.What it's absurd is the diet they suggest. It's simply unrealistic. You can omit that and the rest of the book is great."
2,"Basic information, but some bias by the authors","This book certainly gives a lot of information, but it is biased against certain professionals. For instance, laboratory professionals are portrayed as mistake-makers (these are the people that do all your blood tests, etc.) The laboratory professionals I know are people with graduate degrees. I notice that 2 of the authors are nurses- they never once say that the nursing profession makes mistakes.I also agree with another reviewer that it has an alarmist attitude and the authors definately have their own ideas of what is right and wrong to do during a pregnancy. You'd think that drinking a soda or getting your hair highlighted is tantamount to shooting heroin in their eyes! Lighten up- pregnancy lasts 9 months, what's wrong with a glass of wine once in a while?"
2,There Are Better Books Out There,"When I found out that I was expecting, this is the first book that I purchased. I didn't really like the book - the information seems a bit dated (like the information on exercise). I treated the book more like a reference book and used it to look up things like swollen ankles and feet or safe medications to take. Of all the books I purchased, I liked Your Pregnancy Week by Week by Glade B. Curtis and Judith Schuler. That book was a bit more informative."
1,"Don't buy this one, 0 stars",The writers of this book are very incredibly bossy and theysometimes don't seem to know what they are talking about. I found this book very frustrating. Their attitude is disturbing enough for me to give a negative review. Don't bother with this book. To give you an idea even the woman on the cover looksreally bummed out; probably from reading this book.
1,Common Sense 101,"I was thoroughly disappointed in the quality of information in this book. The majority of it is common sense and I have only been able to refer to it a few times. When I purchased this book, I also bought ""The Expectant Father,"" (Brott/Ash) and found it to be much more useful. My spouse and I have even argued over who got to read it when because it is so interesting. Plus, I prefer the layout much more than the question-answer layout of ""What to Expect..."""
2,Not worth it unless you really enjoy paranoia,"I found the tone of this book condescending and sanctimonious, and the recommendations overly paranoid, as if they are afraid someone might sue them. Frequently they state that there is ""no known risk"" to something but then tell you not to do it anyway. That's my choice, a book should just tell me the risks or lack thereof! I have found much more balanced, sane advice in the book my OB gave me (some offical pub of the OB-GYN association). Also think they should reference weeks pregnant vs. months as no doc I know refers to months. The food info is highly paranoid. You can eat a very healthy diet and still allow yourself a treat now and then, all without putting your baby at risk!"
1,Dumbed-down and erroneous,"I honestly don't know how this book got so popular, as a labor doula, I can honestly say that Naomi Wolfe and others are right about this book. IT's alarmist and condescending and woefully incomplete."
1,Ick! This book will give any expectant mom nightmares....,"I HATE this book. I rushed out to buy it when my husband and I were trying for #1 (who is now 21 months old). It is practically militant in its views about diet- in what universe is a bagel a once-a-week treat?? This book did not help me at all. Its tone is condescending, its answers pat, and basically, while reading it I felt like there was no way I could ever be a good mom. I know it's the one everyone buys, but I think it's just because they don't know better. Even my OB said she doesn't recommend it to patients because it freaks too many of them out!We're expecting #2 now, and I got this book out again, but as you can see I'm back on Amazon looking for a better book this time around."
3,"Lots of info, but not my favorite format","The readers that say this book will scare you are right. The diet recommendations are absolutely impossible to follow (who can eat 11 servings of grains, 3 servings of protein, 4 glasses of milk and still have room for various fruit and vegetables, all in one day?). The Question+Answer format was not my favorite. This is my first pregnancy and I wanted a guide through the different stages of my body changing and my baby growing. ""The mother of all pregnancy books"" was a bit more helpful in this respect. I still think that ""what to expect..."" is a good reference manual, but I got bored pretty fast when going through it. I wouldn't recommend it as the sole book you want to read."
1,leave this one in the store,"With the benefit of hindsight, this was by far the worst book that my wife and I read before our triplets were born. I recommend if you want to know everything that might go wrong and need a reason(s) to visit the doctor for mood altering perscriptions. Honestly, this book was a waste of space. We actually threw it out. One star is way to many."
2,The book you can skip,"Here it is plain and simple. This book spoon-feeds information and does not provide accurate details regarding the risks of standard medical care.Read Henci Goer The Thinking Woman's Guide to Pregnancy, and Janet Balaskas' Active Birth and you will be done, and educated. Half the battle is finding evidence based information that cites reliable sources (I know, I just said the same thing twice!) It is not as easy, but you can do it, and it is the beginning of a lifetime of making truly informed decisions about your baby and your body. Or if you really want to get educated, read this and the others I recommend and take notes on the areas where they differ, then go take a look at the sources and read those."
1,What to expect from a dated attitude,"This book is terrible. Alarmist and very ""doctor knows best"" and treats moms-to-be as if they can't think for themselves. Completely ignores hollistic and natural pregnancy approaches; has only 2 paragraphs on home birth in all 600 pages. Very much a ""pat on the shoulder"" attitude like you'd get from the architypical elderly male OB. Still assumes you're going to give birth in a hospital, on your back. Don't bother with this one."
2,How to get Paranoid when you are expecting,"This book is over the limit. I would like to meet one person who actually followed the best odds diet. I bought this book first after knowing i was pregnant and until I read all these other reviews, I used to agonise that something was wrong with me because I couldnt possibly eat all that is recommended in the""Best odds"" diet. She makes it sound as though it is a crime to indulge once in a while on pizzas and a dessert. I literallywalked around the first 2 mnths with this book in my handwhile doing grocery shopping !The other thing that drove me nuts is that there is hardlyany information on how the baby is developing etc. I am stilllooking for a better book that is more down to earth..."
1,not at all what i needed,"This book was a big disapointment! it focuses almost entirely on the mother and nothing on the baby. The main thrust of this book is that almost anything can happen in a pregnancy, but it's nothing to cause worry....""i have morning sickness,"" "" i don't have morning sickness"" blah blah blah. I would have liked to find out what was going on with my baby, how big is it, does it have fingers yet? This book made me feel like I was gearing up for nine months of medical maladies, not a wonderful blessing. Focus on the baby, or at least mention it please!!!!"
2,Too preachy,"Although this book contains a lot of information, much of it is delivered in a preachy, finger-pointing, and condescending way. I'm a perfectionist and want to be the best mom I can be, but there is no way I could do everything this book suggested. And by the time I finished reading the different concerns/complications of every possible problem that could arise, I was nearly panicked. It was overwhelming for me, being a first-time mom, and already worried about everything anyway... It just didn't seem to be based in reality."
2,What to Expect With This Book,"There is a lot of good medical information in this book, however there is so much information on things that could go wrong that it could leave a first time mom worried. The information on breastfeeding is inadequate at best and moms who plan to breastfeed should not rely on this book."
1,Why be so negative and scary?,"I bought this book because it was one of the first things I heard when someone learned we were pregnant for the first time. I hated it and put it down almost immediately. It should be titled ""What might go wrong with your pregnancy - you better start worrying now!"" Pregnancy is a wonderfully exciting time. Moms-to-be need positive information and support because everyting is so new and unfamilar. I strongly recommend The Pregnancy Book (Sears) or Your Pregnancy:Week by week (Curtis) for moms to keep track of how the baby is developing over the pregnancy. What's the point of being negative and scary?"
4,Useful reference but tends to be unrealistic,"I was given this book by a friend and in the early weeks of pregnancy found it useful. However, the sections on healthy eating - the Best Odds Diet - can leave you feeling anxious and that you are failing. The authors gloss over the fact that many women suffer sickness that makes any eating almost impossible and the Best Odds Diet a joke! A section on how to deal with morning sickness and nutrition before giving lists of foods that you must eat, would reassure women who struggle to eat anything, let alone a Daily Dozen. Buy this book and use it for reference, but read lots of other books alongside."
1,This is the most UNHELPFUL pregnancy book around,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! It is not even written by a doctor, nor is the information that accurate! It will make you INSANE during pregnancy. The advice is stringent and makes you feel as if you cannot even take a sip of water out of the faucet without thinking of all the harmful effects it will do to your baby! STay away from this book!!! There are sooo many better ones out there"
1,bad idea,"this book will make you worry, consider every worst case scenario possible (in the middle of the night). it's demeaning, and i wish i never bought it. big, big mistake. go with the pregnancy book by sears instead."
1,"Almost Unreadable, Definitly Unbearable","Be afraid, be very afraid, seems to be the purpose of this book. Be afraid of birth, be afraid of your body and be afraid to be fat. This book will prepare you only to be a frightened, demure, good little patient, with a medicalized birth full of procedures and a subsequent ""emergency"" C-section. This technocratic freebie is astonishingly outdated and promotes very unhealthy weight management that may CAUSE complications! This book tears down women's confidence in themselves and their ability to give birth with a condescending tone and a bias that states: DOCTOR=GOD. I received much more useful birthing information from books such as ""Husband Coached Childbirth"" by Robert A. Bradley MD, ""Choosing Waterbirth"" by Lakshmi Bertram and ""Primal Mothering in a Modern World"" by Hygeia Halfmoon Phd. Your pregnancy/birth will be as beautiful or as miserable as YOU believe it will be. Trust your body and your baby."
1,Run Away From This Book!,This is one of the worst books for pregnant women. It is scary and will provoke anxiety. Try to read something a little more kind - like The Pregnancy Book by Dr. William Sears. Get good solid information without a lot of bad advice. Become the expert on your pregnancy.
3,"Good Reference, Answers Questions, BUT...","I bought this book when I became pregnant with my first child. I read it almost everyday, figuring that b/c it was so highly recommended it would answer most of my questions. Which it did. However, the pictures are really lacking (see A Child Is Born by Lennart Nilsson for FANTASTIC pics). Also I highly recommend Conception, Pregnancy and Birth by Dr. Miriam Stoppard. The other issue that other readers have had is the condescending way the authors talk to the mommy-to-be. If you are not ""perfect"" before your pregnancy, which NONE of us are, you will wish you were when you read this book. The overweight, the work-aholic, the sendentary, etc. will feel like a worthless, horrible mom-to-be. I took that all with a grain of salt and only focused on the GOOD reference stuff, which there is a lot of. Baby Blessings!i"
2,This is not what I needed during my first pregnancy,"I'm not going to say that this is a bad book ,because it's not. I personally found it to negetive and scary. Instead of helping me it made me insecure. I'm sure that there are people who swear by this book (as seen in some of the reviews) and some condemn this book (as seen in other reviews)I personally agree with the two woman that recommended ""Babytales"" by M.S. Woodson and ""The Girl friends guid to pregnancy"" by Vicki Iovine. I also agree with the person who said t's not for everyone."
2,Why So Negative?,"I do not understand why this series is so popular - is it the good title or just that they have been around some time? My wife and I went out and got an arm full of books and this was one of them. The positive side is that it did seam to provide some good information in a reference method. It also gave us a general idea on what was going on and some of the things to look for. What we did not like is it seams that this book should have come with an overbearing adult wagging her finger at you. I don't think we needed or cared for the tone the book had about the authors militant views on what not to do - is drinking 1 coke really going to be that bad? It is almost like the authors wanted to scare you silly for nine months. Overall an overview, but if you are aggravated by being talked down to then I would look someplace else."
2,"Best selling, but not the best information!","I was snaked in by the label that told me this book is the ""Bestselling Book on Pregnancy."" I quickly found out that doesn't mean it has the best information. The information is presented in a way that is very much in favor of ""whatever your doctor says is right,"" and does not at all encourage intelligent, well-informed women to make their own decisions. The information is scanty on many subjects, and the part on diet makes you feel as though you're causing a birth defect every time you give into a craving. I'd recommend any of Dr. Sears' book over this one."
1,More fuel for the fire . . .,"This book did more to stress me out during my pregnancy than anything else I experienced in those nine months. Yes, it's true that some women do experience rare conditions explained in this book, but most women won't, and throwing every possible complication into a book on general pregnancies probably needlessly frightens many of women. Our babies don't need that added stress! My certified nurse midwife laughed out loud when I asked her if I should avoid deli meats and goat cheese (as advised in 'What to Expect'), telling me that I'd be better off not reading it, and our doula told me she wished she could burn every copy she came across. And the way the authors gloss over c-sections really gets my goat. It's *major* surgery, one with many, many more risks for both mothers and babies, not something to be taken lightly. I'd recommend books like Henci Goer's ""The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth"" instead."
1,I found this book to be completely useless,"This book was given to me by someone as a gift. I found it to be no help at all. Often, it didn't address any of the questions I did have and was packed with a lot of information that I felt was pretty much common sense. I also found it odd that certain areas had a lot of information and other areas had relatively little or nothing. For example it had roughly three pages on the ill-effects of smoking but only about one page combined on alcohol and narcotics. Honestly, I would find a different resource for my questions."
1,bad business,Never received the product. Don't advertise what u don't have or if u are out of town......
5,young teacher mother,This is an excellent book! It has everything you ever wanted to know about pregnancy. It is a must have for all new mothers and even fathers. I strongly recommend it; my obstetrician recommended it to me and he's been in practice for 40+ years!!!
2,"OK, but there are better","It has the basics, but is a bit old fashioned and seems to be getting outdated. Very dry reading without much in the way of detailed medical explanations either. Recommend The Mother of All Pregnancy Books for more heartfelt explanations of what you and your other may be going through, and the Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy for more detailed medical descriptions."
3,DETAILED but NOT STRAIGHTFORWARD & OUTDATED,"PROS: Detailed, easy to read, thorough.CONS: It's in a question & answer format which was annoying because a lot of the questions didn't pertain to me. The index had the questions and which chapter to find the answer but NOT THE ACTUAL PG. # so it was hard to follow. Plus, the info. was OUTDATED. My nurse said that she had the same exact book when she was pregnant with her daughter 14 yrs ago!"
2,Only for typical pregnancy,This book did not list the not so common things that could happen during pregnancy and post partum. I don't feel the diet guidelines were realistic and the question and answer format was more specific then general. I would have preferred more thorough descriptions. I do not plan to use this book for my second pregnancy. I would look into the more modern books that cover more symptoms and accurately describe post partum.
1,Too Much Information!,"My husband asked me to stop reading this book because it was freaking me out! Even as I sit in front of my computer to type this I worry about the poison spewing from my video display monitor (yes, there's an entire section that talks about how miscarriages have never been linked to monitors, but you should still worry about it). Maybe I'll try reading it again during my second pregnancy. But, I have enough on my mind with this being my first that this book doesn't have to add to any of my worries."
1,The Scary Book,"PLease, please heed everyone else's advice and look into other books--there are so many other great ones out there! Thsi book is enough to panic any newly pregnant woman--I read it shortly after finding out I was pregnant and it scared me horribly--my two close friends who are also pregnant/new mothers and I refer to it as ""the Scary book."" Anyway, I met with a prenatal consultant at my hospital who said she absolutely does not recommed this book and cannot understand why it continues to sell so well-- call your doctor or prenatal support at your hospital and ask for recommedations. I love the Girlfriends Guide and even Pregnancy for dummies! My husband also really likes the Expectant Father book. Anyway, good luck to everyone and healthy pregnancies!"
2,What to expect doesn't meet expectations,"Where did all the inane questions come from? The question and answer format certainly did not answer questions I have, and many were somewhat redundant. Although this is an updated edition, it falls short of meeting the needs of expectant mothers in 2002. Read on further through the list of excellent pregnancy books for one that will give more encouraging information for today."
1,I would never recommend this to new expectant moms!,"I have to agree with a lot of the other reviews out there when I say ""don't buy this book""! First, I do not like the question/answer format - it is not helpful, and sometimes a question might occur outside of the month it's lumped into. Second, I was unable to find a lot of answers to my questions, but I could find them on the internet relatively easily. Third, why on earth is this book considered a ""must have"" for the expectant mom? It's more of a nutrition book than anything, and if I were to follow the ""best odds diet"" I'd be eating all the time and worried about everything I put in my mouth. I will never recommend this book to anyone."
2,What to expect if you believe everything doctor says,"The title is unfortunately very accurate, and that is the problem. Comes up short on all counts when compared to 'Pregnancy, Childbirth and the Newborn: the complete guide', by Keppler, Simkin and Whalley. The cover of WTEWYE shows the pregnant woman sitting passively in a rocker. In PC&N she is standing on her own two feet, seeking out information as an active participant, and preparing herself for what she WANTS, not just what she can expect. WTEWYE has an undeservedly enthusiastic following, and is part of the problem in the American way of birth, rather than part of the solution. Don't do your pregnant friends a disservice. Get them a book that respects their ability to make their own choices. This is not the one."
1,Awful book!,"Look for something that celebrates the joy, miracles and excitement of pregnancy. This book has one page each month on what is happening with baby and mom, then page after page of maladies and potential complications which it titles, ""What you may be concerned about."" It should be titled, ""What you have never heard of until you read this book, and is so rare that it probably won't happen to you, but you can now be scared about."""
1,"Better known as ""The book of scary things""","I bought this book when I was expecting my first child, despite thinking the ""expecting"" rather than ""pregnant"" usage a little too cutesy. I returned it the next day; after reading a few pages I became worried that what I was carrying was not an embryo but a dead blob of cells. There are plenty of supportive and informative books that don't dwell on every possible thing that can go wrong. Choose them, and don't be suckered into buying this one just because everyone else does."
2,Not sure why everyone gets this book,"I am really not sure why this is such a popular book. All it did was scare me. They do have some great infomation, but I found that many of our questions were unanswered. Also, a bunch of the sections refer readers to the authors' other books rather than giving a good answer in the book I already owned - the book should be more self contained, not an ad for the authors' other works. I pretty much stopped reading this book by my fifth month after a friend gave me her pregnancy book. I found it much less scary, more complete and better organized."
1,Save your money this is a waste!,Okay I fell for this book because everyone said I had to have it. It was the biggest waste of money! It told me nothing and should be named.... What is pregnancy I am an idiot and just crawled out of a hole. I don't write reviews but if I can save someone some money then this was worth it. The chapters were basically the same and you can find more information online than what was here.On a side note I was given the girlfriends guide and this was interesting and if you are going to buy a book buy this one instead.
4,A Good Pregnancy Primer,"This is one of many pregnancy books that I purchased. The book has good advice, but in some ways it may have too much information (for instance there are many sections discussing things that could go wrong). Overall, though, I think that the information in the book is very useful. It got me through my first pregnancy and now I plan to review it for my second pregnancy."
4,Saved me a lot of tears,"Every twinge, every ache seemed to have an explination here. . .saved me calls to the doctor, but when I *had* to call, it was right on target. As someone with a difficult pregnancy (I had gestational diabetes), it was helpful. I recommend it, and for those who stated things about diet, if I had followed the book instead of ignoring it, I bet I wouldnt have gotten the diabetes or gained 70 pounds! And it is true, you *do* take a chance every time you stick a pill in your mouth. Your doctor will agree, but it is a small risk. Better to be told. And as for brie mentioned above? Will check with my OB/GYN (I am having another), but I never heard that before. Still better than the other books out there, at least it treats you intelligently."
3,"Good basic information, ridiculous diet, judgmental.","The facts about pregnancy were helpful, particularly for women experiencing few or no complications. The ""Best Odds"" diet is ridiculous and impossible for the average woman to follow. Because of this book, I found myself analysing what I ate at the end of the day and felt guilty because I never measured up. My OB even told me that the book was fine, but that I should just rip the diet right out of the book. The Pregnancy Book by Dr. Sears is much better."
2,Condescending and Patronizing,"I believe that healthy food is good. I eat a very healthy diet. However, the authors are condescending and patronizing towards expectant mothers. They act as if we are nutritional idiots who never heard of whole wheat bread before. And if you smoke a cigarette, drink a glass of wine or a cup of coffee or fail to breastfeed, you are a murderer. Period. Truly makes me wonder how my generation ever made it into the world healthy with mothers who drank martinis, smoked, and had white bread toast for breakfast. Good advice but don't take it too literally or you'll have a miserable, guilt ridden pregnancy."
3,Should most likely be a part of your pregnancy library.,"I have bought several books since I learned I was pregnant, and ""What To Expect When You're Expecting"" was recommended by my doctor. It is a solid, informative book, and the information in it should be taken as recommendations only, just as with any other book on the subject.I did not find this book threatening or biased, though certain areas do not apply to me, I think it is wise to know as much as possible about all the things that are involved with pregnancy. I think this is a good book to have on your shelf for pregnancy reference, but it should not be the only one.However, I would recommend this book -over- ""The Girlfriend's Guide To Pregancy"" any day. (See my review on Amazon for why)If you are going to buy this book, I would suggest supplimenting it with the following:""Your Pregnancy Week By Week"" by Glade B. Curtis""Your Pregnancy Month By Month"" by Clark Gillespie"
3,Good book to have but not the best,I found this book to be informative but not the best book to read if you're expecting. I agree with some of the other readers about the Best Odds Diet. Who eats wheat germ - pregnant or not pregnant? The book made you feel that if you didn't follow the diet exactly that your baby would not be okay. I also found that there could have been more information on fetal development and perhaps some photographs of the different phases of development. I did find the book helpful but it was by no means my 'pregnancy bible'.
4,Good Book,"As a first time mom I found this book informative and helpful. This book does list a lot of the things that could go wrong but I don't see a problem with that. You should want to know the symptoms in case something does happen, better than not knowing when something is going wrong. Nothing in the book bothered me to read about, actually it put my mind at ease about a few things I was experiencing and I enjoyed being able to see what I could be feeling from month to month and how the baby was growing. I couldn't stick to the diet they recommended but I was never worried about that as long as my weight was under control. Unless your a paranoid, pessimistic person I think this is a good buy."
3,"Good reference book, but be sure to read other books too","I am expecting my fourth child and still find occasions to open up What to Expect When You're Expecting. While I have referred to What to Expect less and less with each pregnancy, I do find it to be a good reference. Topics are easy to find and I can generally find a question that relates to my concern at the time - the book is made up of questions from women and answers from the authors. Over the years, I have found many books that I like much better than What to Expect - such as The Pregnancy Book which seems to take a more modern approach to pregnancy and a book I recently read called We're Pregnant! which provides a very accurate insight into the day to day life of an expecting couple. I recommend all three - use What to Expect as a reference, The Pregnancy Book as a very informative read and We're Pregnant! to assure yourself that you are not alone in your thoughts and actions, and that you are in good company!"
3,Answered alot of my questions,"This book helped me through my pregnancy with alot of helpful advice. However, I was also convinced I was going into preterm labor because of it also. Most of the symptoms listed under preterm labor, I had! Overall, it was very helpful, and informative. I like how it tells you what is happening with you 'this month' and your baby. Everything is an average with this book so don't be alarmed if you have gained 20 pounds in month 3! Let your friends buy you this book early in pregnancy."
2,not comprehensive enough,"I bought this book before I was pregnant. While it helped me understand the basics of pregnancy, I didn't get the answers I was looking for after my conception. This book is good in informing you about what you should do or not do, but it doesn't explain the causes of why it happens."
5,VALUABLE RESOURCE!,THIS BOOK HAS BEEN VERY VALUABLE TO ME AND MY HUSBAND! IT HAS HELPED US UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS PREGNANCY!
3,Good information if you want it on a monthly basis,"I found the book helpful but I think it would be better if it was broken down a little more like in, say weeks instead of months. Also, I think it would be better with more facts and less questions from outside people, I found that some questions I had were similar but rarely did it hit it on the dot and really give me a clear explaination."
2,So Boring; Much Better Books Out There,"I was cautioned by my doctor not to read this book because it would scare me and now I know why. I was pregnant with my twin boys and to hear the book tell it, I would have the worst pregnancy ever and a zillion things go wrong. Well, the book was wrong and my very healthy boys are 7 months old now and never saw a minute of the NICU. Save your money and sanity and buy ""Your Pregnancy Week by Week"" instead of this book!"
3,Not what you were probably expecting,"I am almost complete with my first trimester. This is the time of pregnancy where every week of your progression seems like a huge milestone. This book lumps weeks together, making the expected mother feel as if there is really nothing special from one week to the next. I have to disagree with this approach. I am eager to learn every new thing; and if I could, I would learn about every single day. I would recommend Your Pregnancy Week by Week, Fifth Edition over this book. Each week has a new picture of development, along with an object to compare the size of the fetus. My child is currently a small plum! :)I also agree with one of the reviewers that a lot of the pregnancy books out there are extremely medically oriented. I found the Magical Beginnings, Enchanted Lives to be much more exciting and holistic. But keep in mind, even this book is written by MDs."
3,"Definately buy it used, there are so many....","I bought this book to add to my library (used). The nurse at my Dr's office warned me that it can make you paranoid. I can understand that. A lot of people rave about this one. It does have a lot of information and can be a good reference; however, I found myself skipping over large sections. Very much focused on medical birth so if you're interested in going the natural route, you'll have to research this further on your own. I prefered the Dr Sears book even though it's not quite encyclopedic in nature."
1,Didn't Even Interest Me At All.,"Like so many expectant mothers, I ordered this book. I thought that with so many positive reviews, this had to be THE book to buy. Truthfully, I think I read about 2-3 pages. I attempted to read it some more at other times, but I really lost interest with this book when I started reading 'Your Pregnancy Week by Week'. Buy at your own risk..."
1,terrible--would never recommend this book,"I would have given this book 0 stars if that was an option. This book is definately one of the worst books on the market. It does not prepare the reader for labor and delivery at all. After reading this book (several times), and thinking I was prepared for labor--I found myself having an unnecessary c-section under general anesthetic (when all I wanted was a natural birth). I wish this book would have spoken more about the risks of pitocen, epidurals, internal fetal monitering, etc...and the plusses of natural births with a midwife at home or in a birthing center."
3,Too much fear.,"As a book editor and mother of three I found this book far too alarming for mother and father alike. The first baby is the hardest, as all mothers know, and the range of advice and information is not only confusing, but also darn scary. Many of the helpful information, however, I believe will be useful for those who need more education on nutrition and supplements, shots, etc., though I think it would be more helpful to pair this book with Gangi's newest release, ""Forget the Cures, Find the Cause, Book II, as it covers pre-pregnancy through high school in its information for parents. All-in-all, this book does help get parents off on the right foot and give them a partial guide that's understandable and easy to read(even if the diet seems hard.)Forget the Cures, Find the Cause: Book 2: The Circle"
1,Look elsewhere if you're into thinking for yourself...,"This book clearly illustrates the total authority the general public gives medical doctors, and the lack of power people perceive they have in making decisions about their health care. Instead of telling you about options you have in regards to tests (which you might not really need, or want) and how you should be progressing, it reads as an alarmist list of directions on how to be pregnant and submit to your doctor without question. Scary stuff."
3,What to Expect when you're expecting,"The book contains useful information in one place, however, I thought it would have been more practical. A lot of the information summarized in the book was information I already knew or obtained from my doctor. If you don't have a computer, then buy the book, but everything in it can be found on baby internet websites."
1,not too good because of format,"The format of the book is by the month. However, my doctor and all other literature refer to the week from the date of last period. I have absolutely no idea where in the book to refer to in order to guage development of baby or my own progress ! I dont recommend the book unless the format is changed."
3,I gave this one away.,"I first read this book when I was pregnant with my first child. During my second pregnancy, I actually gave my copy away to a friend. I, like another reviewer here, found it needlessly alarmist, but that has to do with my philosophy of pregnancy and childbirth.I think if there is reason for a woman to be concerned about a troublesome pregnancy or birth, then this book could provide some good, basic information. Also, any woman who really trusts the standard medical protocol regarding childbirth and pregnancy, will probably like this book.For women who tend to question EVERYTHING their doctor or midwife does, they will not like this book! Just about everything that can go wrong is discussed and the standard procedures that doctors do are not questioned.For the rebellious mother, I would advise that you skip this one and get ""Husband-Coached Childbirth"" and one of the books by Dr. Brewer.And have a happy pregnancy and birth!"
4,pregnancy bible!,I looked to this book almost every day of my pregnancy. It helped to relieve some anxiety and prepare me for labor and delivery. A must have!
3,Not For Those Who Want To Go Natural,"Hi ladies. If you are a first-timer and you want to avoid a cesarean section, you will need a much more powerful book than this to get you through labor. This book is a good resource when it comes to any issues that might come up during pregnancy. However, it gives little or no education on how to have a normal birth. Pregnancy is important, but you will remember you delivery for the rest of your life. Make sure to equip yourself with books like: The Thinking Womans Guide to a Better Birth by Henci Goer and Rhonda Wheeler or Christ Centered Childbirth by Kelly Townsend for all you Christians out there. You birth is important to you and to your baby. Hospital childbirth classes won't be enough. You must begin on a quest to educate yourself on how to get through birth with power and confidence. It is quite possible, and very rewarding! However, this is not the book to help you do that."
1,"Stay away , the cover should have a warning!","I have had this book for the 8 months and feel now that the girl on the front should have warned me to stay away. She looks positivly miserable and most of the book is the same. Very dry in it's contents. This is not the book to read if you have any sense of humor about your pregnancy or want to get the real scoop! Do yourself a favor, Go for Pregnancy for Dummies or the Girlfriends Guide, they are much better reads."
2,This book [mostly] blows,"While there is definitely some good and factual information in this book, it is so peppered with outdated old-school western medical b.s. that it is often maddening and could easily frighten someone who doesn't know any better. It touts things like episiotomy as normal (and often helpful - ?!) and pregnancy weight gain beyond 25 lbs as being the result of ""overindulgence"" during pregnancy -- never mind such other health indicators as blood pressure, hemoglobin and glucose levels, etc. I found this book to be patronizing and obnoxious and it's going right into the recycling bin. A *FAR* better book (and series), in my opinion, is The Pregnancy Book by William & Martha Sears (an MD & RN couple - but open to progressive and more sensible ideas)."
5,I thought it was very informative for me as a first mom & it answered all my questions,This book was great! The reviews about it making people freak out or worry too much. Not me. It just depends upon the person I think. This book answered all my questions & concerns without me calling the doctor over every little change or concern I had throughout my pregnancy. Great book for first time mom's or even a reference book. I say thumbs up.
3,Use this book for REFERENCE only!,"This is an informative reference book; however, it is very preachy. They basically tell you that if you don't consume six bushels of green leafy veggies and two chickens and ten glasses of milk each and every day, you're not doing right by your unborn baby. HELLO! This ain't necessarily so. Use this book as a reference book only, don't let it substitute for your doctor's advice, and buy The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy if you want a book that won't scare you and WILL inform and entertain you! My husband took one look into this book and said, I can't believe women actually buy this. No man would read a book written like this!"
1,overrated,"This book is the most over rated book out there. This is my first pregnancy and I have *tons* of questions, especially in my first trimester. This book answered NONE of them. Simple questions like, I'm spotting is that commom (yes). My uterus feels heavy and I feel a ""pulling"" sensation! Is this ok? (yes).Don't waste your money. I love The Mother of all Pregnancy Books and Merriam (sp) Stoppard's The Complete Guide to Pregnancy."
3,A good resource - but what is with all the scare tactics???,"I got this book the day I found out I was pregnant. I *thought* it was THE book an expectant mother to buy. It really is a good resource for questions regarding basic biological changes during pregnancy. However, it made me feel like every breath I took I was one moment closer to a miscarriage.For example, soda pop. This book will tell you that soda has no place in your pregnancy - because it either has too much sugar, is diet (and *we all know* how *bad* diet drinks are, right?), or contains caffiene. The only thing I could drink while going through the roughest Morning Sickness was Dr. Pepper - everything else I threw-up. This book made me feel like I was going to kill my baby!Another example would be coffee - should I drink it? Yet again, it uses the scare tactic: ""Well, you can drink some coffee, but the more you drink the more likely you are to miscarry.""So, if you can read between the lines in the book - you will do just fine!"
1,Provincial and outdated,"After recently finding out that I was pregnant, I purchased this book as I figured it was the ""bible of pregnancy"". What I found instead was an outdated and superficial overview of pregnancy. On a basic level, the authors continually refer to one's husband, which I find so outdated in 2002 when one may have a same sex partner, or no partner at all. While this seemingly superficial complaint is obviously not a reason to buy the book, I do find that it encapsulates the sophomoric and provincial ways of the author. If I could return the book, I would have. Instead I put it out with the recycling."
3,It is your Pregnancy - take control of your information!,"This is the first book that I bought to give me an idea of what to expect during my first pregnancy. While the overall layout leaves something to be desired (it appears monthly, but then other information is spread throughout), and the tone may be somewhat alarmist, I found that it gave me the general information that I needed. I knew almost nothing about what to expect and would rather be extra cautious my first pregnancy than to do a big no-no because of ignorance.I woudl recommend this book to someone who needs the general information, but also has enough common sense to adapt some of it's guidelines to their own lifestyle (for example, one soda is not a good drink choice in this book, but if you like soda and would feel comfortable drinking one every other day or even every day, making sure to intake enough water etc, then go ahead and do it!)."
1,Read any book but this,"This is absolutely, no holds barred, the worst pregnancy book available. Avoid it all costs. Not only is much of the information inaccurate the writing and organization are terrible, the author is condescending and pedantic. It's words and advice are geared toward making expectant moms feel frightened, stupid, and unable to make their own choices. It also offers tips that put the mother in danger . Avoid this book. Instead pick up A Good Birth, A Safe Birth. It is much better, very empowering, and provides more accurate information."
1,Scary. . .,"This was the first book on pregnancy I read when I was pregnant. The diet and nutrition section scared the Hell out of me! By the time I was done reading that section, I was terrified that eating a peanut butter or having a cup of coffee would result in my giving birth to Quasimodo.The information is mostly provided in a question and answer artcle format, that I personally found annoying and tracking down information was difficult.After reading this book, I felt scared and depressed, and very grateful I had checked the book out from the library instead of actually purchasing it. So back to the library I went in search of a better books on pregnancy, and discovered Dr. Sears Pregnancy Book. A much better source of information, with a more realistic view of diet and nutrition, and easier reading format."
1,What to be AFRAID of...,"Here's what the one star is for: I liked tracking my baby's development month by month. It was nice to know what was growing, what was new, what she could do each month. Other than that, it was useless. The worst thing about this book is that it tells the reader that they cannot trust their own intuition but instead to take their physician's word as gospel. Instead of providing calm advice about things that might be going on of concern during a woman's pregnancy, it tells you to run to your doctor. The message this book sends it that everything is something to worry about and women shouldn't be trusted to know their bodies well enough to have an opinion. Ladies, DON'T READ THIS BOOK! Get Ina May's Guide to Childbirth for a far more realistic book that looks out for the woman rather than the medical industry."
3,Good Book... Not For Everyone..,"This is a good book for a new mother-to-be, but if you are a worrier, I would definitely not recommend this book. It gives a lot of useful information, but it also talks about what can go wrong in every stage of pregnancy with a lot of detail. If you want to know everything, what is happening when in your body or in your child's, then this is a good book for you.I think that the information in plain text format would have been better rather than using Question & Answer format.I used this book with my first pregnancy in 2002, but not with my second one in 2007. I worried a lot about complications during my first and I did not want to experience the same with the second."
4,Very informative!,"This goes month by month through all the changes you will experience! One thing I really liked about this book were the recipes that are ""tummy friendly"" if you need that, like I did. It is difinitely a good read and full of information. It even includes information about the first 6 weeks after your child is born and what to expect then. I read both this one and The Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy, I highly recommend reading both!"
3,Good refrence book at times!,"I bought this book when I started to finally feel my baby moving, I wanted to make sure everything was ok. I like this book when Im having a new symptom I've never had before and need a quick reference but it seems to focus on the negative sides of things more than the positive and at times seems to be scary! The book goes month by month also which I didn't like, Ide rather have a week by week reference but its nice to know what to expect for the month."
4,What to Expect..............,"I like all the 'What to Expect..' books. I've used them as references in my work as a Telephone Triage nurse for many years. I gifted our grandson and granddaughter with a set and this copy is a replacement for one I loaned but wasn't returned. Now that I'm a greatgramy, they are even more helpful in understanding, supporting and teaching. Life has changed a lot since mine were born...but pregnancy, babies and toddlers continue. And some folks need all the help we can provide. These are very helpful, reader friendly, and practical tools for parents, young and older.."
3,"Complete, and Completely Scary","This book truly covers everything that could possibly be uncomfortable or scary about your pregnancy. I kept telling my husband, ""My God! Listen to what could happen to me,"" and he kept responding, ""Stop reading that book already!""If you are prone to worrying about your pregnancy, do not, I repeat, DO NOT buy this book! It will just get you worrying about symptoms and problems that you may never even experience. However, if you are the type who would only use this book as a reference & who would not read it cover to cover in order to have more things to worry about, it might be a good book for you.Overall, keep in mind that there are LOTS of other books about pregnancy that are informative while being less scary than What to Expect. There are also books that are more entertaining, more reassuring, more spiritual, etc. I would hardly call this particular book necessary when there are so many resources out there."
1,Yuck!,"This book was not only scary to read, it took the joy and excitement and miracle out of having a baby. Yes, it has lot's of information, about things you'll most likely never need to know about (unless you read this book). I found it depressing and frightening."
3,Informative -- but scared me as a first time mom,"Being pregnant for the first time, I consulted this book for every little ache, pain or question I had during my pregnancy instead of just calling my doctor. I found that more often than not, I was misdiagnosing myself or overreacting to something very minor. This book is quite informative; however, a lot of the information can be misconstrued. I do not recommend this book for first time mothers - just ask your doctor - he/she knows best!"
2,Not impressed with this book....,"What to expect does have a lot of information regarding child and mother to be development, but there is also a lot of information in there which talks about the problems that can occur during pregnancy. While the risks and potential problems are important to be aware of, there is a way in which the risks and problems can be discussed realistically without causing fear. After getting anxious about all of the potential complications, I put the book down and only read the sections which didn't loosely or incompletely discuss what can go wrong during pregnancy."
3,"For Reality, Look To The Mommy Trap and The Girlfriend's Guide","I found this book and What To Expect The First Year to be very mixed. It is comprehensive about many aspects of pregnancy but the authors seem to be at a loss as to to what REALLY happens to women when they become mothers, especially to their relationships with their husbands and their work/life identities. The book is written in an ""institutional"" style, and has tons of information but little life to it. When I was pregnant, I vastly preferred The Girlfriend's Guide, because it was funny and true. After I had my baby, I devoured ""How To Avoid The Mommy Trap"" and still keep it at my bedside. My husband looks in it too. The Mommy Trap showed us why we fell into the roles we did (partly because we had a sanitized, rosy view of parenthood encouraged by What To Expect) and how to get out of them when we slip. What To Expect is a good start, but it's not enough. Modern motherhood is difficult. And funny."
2,Too negative,"I have to weigh in with the folks who said it was much too negative. I totally agree. I am in my 4th month of an easy pregnancy (knock wood) but in month one I was wondering if I had an eptopic pregnancy and kept looking to see if I was miscarrying. I get very tired of opening this book and seeing ""I'm very worried about..."" or ""Am I normal if I have..."" It gets old and depressing very fast. I am treating my pregnancy like a healthy, normal female activity and am enjoying it!"
1,How did this ever get to be called the pregnancy bible?,"I am a first-time mom and eagerly bought this book. I think it is way too basic, fear-mongering and just plain boring. My other major complaint is that she continually uses the word ""husband"" and ""father"". Not all of us out there fit into these categories - other books out there talk about raising a child alone and/or use the word ""partner"". This book is just awful."
1,Misleading - do not recommend!,"As a childbirth educator, I found that even though this book is well organized and is easy to read, it does not provide risks, side affects, and natural alternatives for many medical procedures presented. It encourages kind of a wait and see attitude in terms of preparing for labor and birth instead of really providing the information in a factual way so that women and think about and make the best informed decisions regarding procedures and meds. I found that to be quite irresponsible. I think this may be one of the reasons we have a 25% ceserean rate in the US."
4,The helpful guide to pregnancy,I do absolutely reccommend this book. I found it very helpful. However it does not take the place of a real life childbirth class which I believe is absolutely essential for all new mothers.
3,Nothing about the magic!,"There is no wonder in this book. More bang for my book buck was 10 Principles For Spiritual Parenting. It helped me decide how I wanted to ""be"" when my baby was born 4 months ago.....it's been such a great guide since. This book seemed to make me fearful rather than radiant."
2,What to worry about....!,"I read ""What to Expect"" quite a bit in my first few months. It was a useful guide to answer questions between doctor's visits. However, I picked it up again recently, in my eighth month, and was astounded by how negative it sounded. Its focus on ""Concerns you may have"" really began to scare me, as it made me worry about things I hadn't thought to worry about! It is not helpful to dwell so much about what might theoretically, rarely go wrong. I also found that the Best Odds Diet was totally annoying and unrealistic. For a more positive, comprehensive book, try ""The Baby Book"" by Bill and Martha Sears."
1,No help at all!,"My OB actually GAVE me this book on my first visit. It's horrible. I never was quite sure how they divided up there months(which weeks were which months- every book does it differently). Plus, it didn't seem like they actually had information corresponding to the correct month in that particular chapter. Not to mention that it never talked about anything except what could go wrong. Oh, and the ""Best Odds Diet""- are you kidding me! I AM NOT a bad mother just because I ate a candy bar or a piece of cake! This book was made me feel horrible about myself, and I was constantly worried. ""The Pregnancy Book"" by Sears was much more reassuring,uplifting, and answered many many more questions."
2,Scares the bejeebers out of you. Skip it.,"If you're in your first pregnancy and looking for a good reference guide, skip this book. This was one of several books we purchased and every time we'd look up some perfectly normal symptom during our first pregnancy, we'd get alarmed by its dire predictions of dead babies, brain damaged babies, ""see your doctor IMMEDIATELY"" warnings. If we didn't have other references, we'd be seriously stressed out about a perfectly normal, healthy first pregnancy. The information is generally accurate, if a bit over-reactive and designed to keep you on the phone with your doctor 24 hours a day. After the first couple of months, it was put on the bookshelf and never opened again.Save your money. We strongly preferred ""The Pregnancy Book"" by Dr. Sears. ISBN 0316779199. And all of the other books in that series after you have your healthy baby. Buy it on amazon and save yourself unneeded stress that accompanies any of the books in the ""What to expect..."" series."
1,patronizing AND terrifying,"This is one of the few books I've ever read that made me want to throw it across the room. If you are pregnant and looking to be both patronized and terrified, this is the book for you. The ""Best Odds"" diet is the most absurd: be prepared to feel guilty if you don't follow it, or to gain 50 lbs. if you do."
1,Weak book,"This book didn't have the information I was looking for. I wanted to know more about what was going on with the baby develpmentally. I wanted specific information about teratogens, not just advice to avoid all drugs. I had a very difficult pregnancy--seven months of nausea--and the frequent admonitions of the author about diet were just too much. The tone and repetition of the book made it seem like it was written for a slow child. Looking for a great book that respects the intelligence of the reader? Get 1000 Questions About Your Pregnancy by Jeffrey Thurston."
1,How does this book keep on selling?,"It is entirely beyond me how this book has become a classic. We were out with several other expectant couples the other night when this volume came up during our (no surprise here) book-and-baby-oriented discussion.In short, our collective reading seems to be that this book seem to 1) pander to your basest fears and anxieties; 2) assumes that the reader is gushingly thinking about baby all of the time; and 3) society is stuck somewhere in the 1950s in terms of relationships and marriage. We all just wanted sound advice and science, not fear mongering, emotional mush, or strange relationship advice."
2,Too clinical. Not enough emotional content.,"I bought this book because it is one of the best selling pregnancy books in the nation. Unfortunately I didn't read a sample passage before purchasing. I was sorely disappointed with the content and writing style (and later my RN and other pregnant women told me they had made the same mistake and disliked the book too). This book gives a long list of potential symptoms a pregnant woman can feel during each month of pregnancy. It does not address the emotional aspect of pregnancy (just some bullet points on what you may be feeling). We have since read other books that we enjoyed much more. My husband is enjoying ""Mack Daddy: Mastering Fatherhood Without Losing Your Style, Your Cool, or Your Mind"" by Larry Bleidner. While I'm enjoying ""A Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy by Vicki Iovine."" And together we are reading ""The Baby Book"" by William and Martha Sears -- a book that focuses on parenthood (i.e. what to do after the baby comes)."
1,The worst pregnancy book ever written!,If you plan on being nerotic and scared out of your mind your whole pregnancy then this is the book for you! I cringe when a mom to be tells me they are or have read this book. There are a dozen or so other books out there that are more beneficial to a mom/parents to be to read ( Anything by Aviva Romm). If you wind up with a copy use it for kindling.
1,Should be called the Pregnancy Diet Book,"I found this book offensive. It seemed to be almost entirely devoted to diet and how NOT TO GET FAT DURING PREGNANCY. Oh please, make the preaching stop. I finally had to put it down. I can't recommend it. The other information in the book is given in Q & A form which I found unhelpful. If you happen to have the same question or a similar concern as someone who contributed to the book has then you'll get an answer. But you have to wade through the muck to get there.I give it a big thumbs down."
2,"Some good information, but a little scary","I read this book as soon as I found out I was pregnant, and was sure that every little thing was something going drastically wrong. I tried to follow their diet plan, but it was impossible, plus making sure I got all the things that were just CRITICAL to baby's healthy development - I gained 11 pounds the first month! The best advice I got was just use common sense about eating, and ask your friends who've had kids, your mom or your OB/GYN about everything else."
3,"It is okay, but not my main reference book...","I purchased this book for my sister when she was pregnant three years ago. It has a lot of good information in it and I wouldn't completely discount it.However, I have purchased The Mayo Clinic Guide to A Healthy Pregnancy in addition to this book for myself and I must say that it is more thorough, scientifically based, and better organized. I like its ""just the facts"" approach and tone better than this book, and I think the information in the Mayo Clinic Guide is better-organized.What to Expect is a great resource, but I wouldn't recommend that it be relied on as a primary reference to pregnancy. There is simply better stuff out there nowadays!"
3,Informative but dull,"I've read several pregnancy books, and while this one had a lot of good information, it was never a book I wanted to sit and read cover-to-cover. It was a book I went to if I had a specific question about something. Even with that, it would sort of answer my questions, but the answers would leave me unsatisfied and wanting more. I'm really not sure why this is considered to be the be-all and end-all of pregnancy books. Think of it as a good reference book to have, like a dictionary. But if you want a book about your pregnancy that's both informative AND fun to read, capturing the excitement, anticipation, confusion, and fear that goes hand-in-hand with being pregnant - look elsewhere."
3,Okay not to great,I can not say that I did not enjoy this book at all. It was full of useful information that helped me along the way. However I did not like the question and answer format. I didnt like the way she addressed the information. She used questions that people asked and then answered them as she felt fit. I would have rather read a book that gives you useful information not based on other peoples questions about there pregnancy. I did not enjoy reading other peoples questions and reading the information based on that question. I would not recommend this book nor would I buy her what to expect the first year. There are many other books I read and enjoyed more than this one.
1,There are so many better books out there!!!,"I just don't understand the appeal of this book. Everyone who knows I'm pregnant told me I had to rush out and buy it, so I did. What a mistake. I've since found other books that have far more information and that are a whole lot less preachy--like The Pregnancy Book by the Sears, The Unofficial Guide to Having A Baby by John Sussman, and Pregnancy, Conception, and Birth by Dr Miriam Stoppard. It's a good thing that everyone thinks they're supposed to have this book or the authors would be in trouble. No one would buy it on its own merits. If and when the authors revise the book, they might think of scrapping the chapter on diet altogether. It's just plain insulting."
1,Terrible support for the most natural activity in the world,"This book can deeply damage the most wonderful experience of a lifetime. It is written with no thought to empowering woman at this important time but instead is directed to the pregnant woman who views her condition as an illness to be cured by doctors. The section on diet suggests you have all day to run around preparing the perfect healthy meal. If you are a working mother, much of the advice will cause anxiety because you can't follow it (i.e. take several days off to recover from jetlag). The content of this book will make pregnancy seem like the most devastating moment of your life. Throw it away and buy anything by Dr. and Martha Sears instead. They assume pregnant woman are capable healthy adults and natural mothers."
1,laughable,"As a student studying child development under a multitude of child developmentalists, this book is a one word joke. Not one of my professors respect this book, as it is ancient, written for mothers from the 1960's. After during a presentation on this book last semester, we got into a detailed discussion on the limited choices this fear mongering books offers. Do yourself a favor, save yourself from the extra stress (very bad for a baby) and do some more research. Don't reach for the old standby."
1,Read only if you really are perfect,"This book drove me nuts. It is one huge condescending guilt trip. You are smart enough to know that you need to eat well and take care of yourself.I followed the diet, ended up with gestational diabetes at 11 weeks, and spent the next two years losing the water I gained from the ill-advised diet. The diet did not give me diabetes. But there should be more discussion and forgiveness of other health factors that may alter the diet and other recommendations. My doctor put me on a diet very different from this book's recommended diet, and I felt like I was cheating my child because I could not eat the ""perfect"" diet.I strongly recommend Vicki Iovine's The Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy."
1,Should only be used as fire kindling...,"This is the WORST book out there on childbirth. I bought this book with my first baby as it was highly recommended to me by my OB, and no wonder?! It teaches you how to be a completely passive patient with little or no information on side effects of medications and procedures done in the hospital. Don't waste your money, do an internet search on what you want to find out. I would recommend instead The Thinking Woman's Guide to a Better Birth. The only plus side to this book is how it tells you month by month what your baby looks like, but again you can find that on the internet. This book makes you a good patient for the OB and not an active informed birther. Women do not NEED episiotomies, IVs, External Fetal Monitors, Epidurals etc. like this book makes it seem to birth safely. Please don't waste your money on this. Inform and empower yourself, be strong enough to be a bad patient and instead an awesome mom and terrific birther!!!"
2,Not a Must-Have,"I am expecting my first baby at the age of 43. Well-meaning friends insisted from the beginning that I MUST have ""What To Expect""--""It's the Bible."" ""It answers all your questions."" Even my doctor's office gives out copies.I have found the book less than helpful. I want to know much more about my baby's development and much less about me. I need to know when my child develops toes. I want to know what he/she hears and sees in there. I don't need to know about hair dyes or diets that I will never follow.I also need a lighter approach than is found in ""What To Expect."" The writing style strikes me as chilly and clinical. This is a joyous and often very humorous life experience. Novice moms-to-be need a laugh along with the facts.In short, ""What To Expect"" has answered very few of my questions. It's decent reference for the bookshelf, but not my Bible, by any means."
4,Saved my life....,"I can credit this book with actually saving my life. I understand how the ""What could go wrong"" section could scare you if you are having a normal pregnancy. I had a placental abruption at 28 weeks, and though I was very asymptomatic, the book encourages you to call your doctor if you even THINK something might be wrong. I did, and I had to have an emergency c-section. For a first time mom, the experience was very scary, but if I hadn't had a book that looked at what may go wrong in 1% of pregnancies, I would have died. It's definately not the be-all and end-all of pregnancy books, but I found it to be very informative and helpful."
1,"HORRIBLE- If I could rate less than 1 star, I would","This is the worst pregnancy book out there. The information is presented with a lot of gloom and doom; it would make any expectant mother think that she is not doing a good job if she's not following every piece of advice in the book.I don't understand why this book is so prevalent as a gift at baby showers--maybe because it is inexpensive and has a catchy title.As far as trouble shooting or dealing with any kind of problems that arise, the book doesn't deal with them well. And this book is TERRIBLE for anyone that is hoping to breastfeed.I would NOT buy this book if it were the last thing on the shelves."
2,Colossal Waste of Time,"As soon as I found out I was pregnant I ordered this book from Amazon. I'll admit, I fell for the hype. Apparently this is ""The book to get when you're pregnant"". Boy,what a waste. I really don't see why it is so insanely popular! If you need a book to tell you to run to your doctor every time you have a question or concern then this book is for you. If you want to be patronized page after page then this book is for you. Overall I think this book is written for people who are a) easily influenced, b) believe everything the read and c) are susceptible to scare tactics. If you are the kind of person who is willing to think for yourself and make informed decisions, I would go elsewhere. Try www.babycenter.com for good information and unbiased answers to your questions, and read ""The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy"" for those little extras no one else tells you as well as some much needed comic relief!p.s. congrats on your pregnancy!!"
2,Not the best AT ALL,"The book was a good starting point, but had a lot of misleading information. Seemed like every other day I thought I was having a miscarriage (during the first trimester) because of this book. My husband took it away from me and bought ""Your Pregnancy Week by Week"", which was much more positive and informative."
3,Informative - but stressful and in some ways unrealistic.,"This book includes some really great information for the newly-pregnant woman. However, the section on diet is absolutely ridiculous and unrealistic. It makes the reader feel completely inadequate and changes mealtime into an ordeal."
2,"Basic Information, but focus is too much on the negative","This was the first book I bought when I found outI was pregnant. I found the information helpful,but somewhat limited.The book tends to focus on the negative aspectsof pregnancy so often that my husband took the book away from me so I would quit worrying so much. I'm not sorry I bought it, but if I could only have one book on pregnancy, this would not be it."
2,"WHAT are you doing HERE? Try ""The Birth Book"" By Sears and Sears instead!","While this book provides much information about medicalized prenatal care and hospital labor and birth, it is as biased as it comes. I disliked the unsubstantiated anti-midwife stance, and the way the author presented the list of prenatal tests as inevitable and unquestionable. The discussions about the safety and accurace of these tests were incomplete and biased. I also found it absurd to include a chapter about possible complications and tell women not to read it. I also disliked the question-answer format. All of the information in this book can be found in other consumer-oriented books without the intervention-as-normal-and-desireable attitude"
3,good thing it's cheap- you'll want more books,"Most women like the developmental information, but find the rest of the book unrealistic, condenscending, and irritating. The authors- a couple of RN's, so no, they aren't physicians- seem to assume that you will treat your mainstream obstetrician or midwife as a god and final authority. If that's what you want, fine. If you want a safe, empowering birth, and a good outcome, look for information elsewhere. Try ""The Birth Book"" by Wm and Martha Sears, ""A Good Birth, A Safe Birth""... and by all means, avoid the rest of the books in the WTE series- most are worse than this one.I found that I was nauseated by reading the book by about the 5th month the first time around, and it was relegated to bathroom reading the second time around."
3,Good to have during your first pregnancy.,"If you are at all interested in natural childbirth and/or what your options are during pregnancy and birth, this book definity does not cover that. However, it was very reassuring during my first pregnancy when I had no idea what to expect from my body. If this is not your first pregnancy, you can probably skip this book"
4,Great book,"Great book! Gave lots of good anwers to common pregnancy complaints.. however organization wasnt the best, but it was still a good read!"
4,Great Book!,"This is filled with detailed, specific information month by month. It's a wonderful book. It's also quite big so your gettting it at a great price!"
2,Much too scary... Who needs this much paranoia?,"I did read this cover to cover for both of my pregnancies because friends told me to. I was lucky to be a calm expectant mother, and to have an excellent OB who spent time with me, and answered my every concern. After he asked me what I was reading, and I replied, he said,""Toss that book in the garbage!"" Who needs to be in such a constant state of anxiety? Certainly not a pregnant mom. Go for the Good Housekeeping Illustrated Guide to Pregnancy. Also check out 125 Things You Must Know About Being Pregnant, by Nina Landi. Totally sweet, cute, and not one second of alarm. Good luck with your pregnancies!"
2,Only okay--don't use as your only resource!,"I was not very pleased with this book at all. I found the organization and structure to be not very good. For example, I'm in my second month, but I had to search all over the book for answers to questions I had about things I'm experiencing now! Also, the Best Odds diet is not only restrictive (at best), it's also unrealistic. Do you consider a bagel made with refined flour a once-a-week treat? Moreover, the childbirth section is painfully lacking in thorough information. While this book does contain useful information, don't make it your only resource. For a wonderfully thorough, detailed, and well-written resource, I really recommend ""With You and Your Baby All the Way,"" by Jerri Colonero."
2,CRISIS! SCARY!,"Everything seems to be a scare tactic. Very little is put in perspective for the (sometimes emotional) expectant mother. This book was given away by the hospital, so we're glad we didn't waste $10."
3,There are better pregnancy books,"I found this book a little preachy and negative. I eat a pretty healthy diet, but couldn't stand the section on nutrition. It's unnecessarily restrictive and not completely accurate. It will only make you feel guilty.There is some good information, but there are other books with better and more complete information and better organization. My favorites are ""1000 Questions About Your Pregnancy"" and ""Mayo Clinic Complete Book of Pregnancy & Baby's First Year"". They are both extremely thorough, well-organized, and work great for reference. Both of these books tend to put things in perspective, maintain a positive tone and really present you with all the facts. In general, I think the pregnancy books written by doctors are the best.That being said, I still pick up this book from time to time to compare information. It's OK, but definitely not the best."
2,There are better books out there...,"I didn't care for this book - even though it seems that some love it. I felt like there was a lot of focus on ""bad"" things that could happen. It just made me worry more, which isn't good."
2,major lack of organization,"This is almost meant to be read as a story, which isn't what I was looking for. The bulk of the book pretends to be organized by the various time segments of your pregnancy. (Month 1, Month 2) But only the first page or two of the chapter discusses the changes you and the baby are going through at that time. Instead each chapter has a random mix of Q and A's that you would have at any point in the pregnancy. I just didn't follow it at all."
2,"Overly medical, stress-inducing book","My sister in law insisted I borrow this book from her claiming that it was the ""best pregnancy book ever"". What I found was a lot of fear mongering that treated pregnancy more like a terminal illness than the joyful occasion it really is. I literally couldn't force myself to read very much of it, and the parts I did read made me feel like every little bit of queasiness was a miscarriage waiting to happen or if I ate a bite of ice cream my baby would come out sick. If you are looking for a guide to pregnancy with a bit of heart, I suggest Dr. Sears' The Pregnancy Book; if you are looking for a nutrition guide that is easy to follow and well researched, I recommend Barbara Luke's Program your Baby's Health: The Pregnancy Diet for your Child's Lifelong Well-being."
2,"Okay, If you don't mind being a little nervous!","This book is informative, however on several occasions I used it as a research tool before calling my doctor with my concerns, and it only made me reach for the phone even faster. It does not explain that many things that you think are strange during pregancy are actually VERY NORMAL!!!! I also do not like the set up of this book. It works on calendar months instead of by weeks of pregnancy that my doctor uses."
3,mixed feelings,"Before I read this book this past weekend, I read through others' reviews and wasn't sure what to expect when I read it. I'm a little in the middle. I don't think that the Best-Odds Diet is too unrealistic, especially if you were used to eating a very healthy diet before you became pregnant. However, I am struggling with the weight gain calculations. I'm only 7 weeks along and I have already gained my 3 lbs. I don't know how realistic the weight scale is since we all are very different in height, size, weight, etc. I skipped the section on what can go wrong in your pregnancy. I will only refer to that IF I HAVE TO! otherwise, why torture yourself on reading the ""what ifs"". I also have only read ahead through month ""4"" because I won't remember anything I read today 6 months from now. I suggest reading it, but don't limit yourself to just this ONE. I'm going to try Sears book as well. I see a lot of positive words about his book."
1,man's view of this book,"This book supports a myth that childbirth, motherhood, pregnancy are easy, natural and an etheral expereince. It does not give you any ""real"" data or information (ex; probability of birth defects, nor does it give any research on the reality of bottle feeding with formula as a valid feeeding method). It does give you a nice pat on the back that may reassure you. The bottom line though is it can make you feel very guilty if you decide to do what generations of parents (probably including your own) have done, and that is do what works for YOU to keep yourself HEALTHY and HAPPY. My advice, chuck all of these books out the window, have your mom, or mom n law or sister, or all of them move in for the first couple months with the newborn and learn from those who have done it before. You can not get from this book what you can get from mothers around you."
3,There is no such thing as a 'Baby Bible',"I was given this when I was pregnant with my first child- and it terrified me! Every time my little girl wiggled I consulted the book and ended up -slightly hysterical- in the GPs surgery. I finally put all of my books on the shelf and focussed on getting acquainted with my child. That said, when I was pregnant with my fourth child, I was able to use the book successfully to self-diagnose gestational diabetes. No book will teach you anything about YOUR child. Each child and pregnancy is unique. That said, this book is a useful reference, and I keep it on the shelf to consult when my own experience is lacking."
2,"Some substantive information, a lot of scare tactics.","I was disappointed in this book. I found it to be extremely patronizing and absolutely humorless. I want specific information about the baby's development on a week-to-week basis, and this book barely describes fetal development. The diet it recommends is a joke. The cover is offensive- that woman looks like she's been drugged. Pregnancy is a healthy, normal developmental state, not a disease. As a pregnant woman, I want lots of information about every aspect of pregnancy. I can make my own decisions and judgements, with the aid of my doctor. I don't need a book to tell me what to do, I need a book to educate me. I wish this book weren't the top seller- I hope women are finding other books that provide more useful, positive information."
3,Gift for a friend,"Bought this for a friend of mine who is a expecting her first baby. I think this book kind of freaked her out lol I flipped through some of it and found it interesting, but I've never had a child and I've worked for an ob/gyn and was a nursing major so none of that stuff freaks me out...I guess I would recommend this book lol"
3,May not be a good idea if you're a worrier,"Contains lots of information. Can be anxiety-provoking if you are a worrier. If you find yourself worrying about the things you read, I would recommend something on the funny side, but with just as much info."
2,Don't expect much~,"This book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy. Save your cash and get it from the library. Then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman, not a child taking orders or information without question. If you want to go through pregnancy, labor and birth, and have no say at all or learn anything useful, then stick with this book; i.e., go to the hospital, have an epidural, episiotomy, then finally the c-section that 'must' have been necessary, this is it.Beyond that, read Ina May Gaskins, Henci Goer, the Sears' books, and ""Childbirth Without Fear."" Read a broader selection - many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore. I am a mother of 4; have had healthier, more positive birth experiences than anyone I know. This book is misleading and negative.Make it the joyful event you deserve!"
2,Not for me,"This book is quite high-level and gets into very little detail. The Q&A format is not my favourite and I found the style a bit patronizing. It is also a U.S. book and doesn't provide any information on Canada-specific options. The Mother of All Pregnancy Books is a better resource and I recommend it for anyone seeking this ""overview"" kind of literature. Unlike ""What to Expect,"" it is Canadian, and a more detailed book that covers an equal or greater breadth of topics. It is also less focused on the negative, though it covers issues and fears in detail."
2,What to freak out about when you're expecting,"My mom gave me this when I first got pregnant, and I dutifully read it every month for the first half of my pregnancy.Not too surprisingly, I felt worried about all the tests and complications described, guilty because I didn't manage to follow their diet perfectly, and found myself anxiously awaiting the onset of the pregnancy side effects described. I also thought the tone was pretty patronizing.I stopped reading it about 3-4 months ago and since then have felt great, have a healthy pregnancy and much less anxiety."
2,Read this book if you want to feel miserable,"I started reading this book when I still suffered from slight morning sickness, but now, almost halfway my pregnancy, reading this book still makes me fel sick. I think the emphasis on weight gain and food issues is very annoying. I appreciate some advice, but there is a limit. This books makes me feel guilty every time I eat a cookie or some ice cream.Also, I will decide if I want to spend a fortune on maternity clothes or not. Maybe I have a fortune to spend?Moreover, I believe that many complications mentioned in hte normal month to month chapters are so exotic, they should be in a seperate section named 'very rare complications and problems'.I say no to this book, being pregnant is worrysome enough without this book!"
2,what to worry about..,I wish I didn't buy this book. It only made me think that there was something wrong. It also only had about 1 or 2 pages related to a twin pregnancy.
4,Good,"It what I expected. Informative. A weekly calendar might have been a little nicer than a monthy one, as so many things happen in a month. It covers all the basics."
2,I should have listened to my doctor....She said not to read this one,"When I found out I was pregnant I went straight to the store to find a book about pregnancy. I had heard about this one so it's the one I purchased. I wish I would have waited, once I started reading it I started to panic. As most 1st time moms I knew nothing about being pregnant & this book made me feel like everything I was experiencing was a problem. When I told my doctor that I had this book, she told me to put it in the back of the closet & not look at it again. I did pick it up again after my son was born; the chapter on the first few weeks of life was the only thing worth reading that did not cause panic. Don't waste your money on this book."
1,Not the Best book!,"I purchased this book because I thought it was ""THE BOOK"" on pregnancy. After reading the first chapter I put the book under my bed. As a first time expecting mother, I don't won't to be frighten at the fact that I ""did color my hair"" before I found out I was pregnant. And I don't want to worry for the entire pregnancy if I harmed my baby. I don't want to think that every normal pain I feel like stretching, is cause for concern. Don't waste your money, buy another book!"
1,Title should be Expect the Worst When You are Expecting!!!,"This was by far the worst book I read when pregnant. The last thing anyone needs when expecting their first child is a 624 page detailed list of anything and everything that could ever go wrong during a pregnancy. I found myslef being paranoid all the time. I finally threw the blasted thing away and began to feel much much better both physically and emotionally.I liked Pregnancy Week-by-Week because it described how the baby was growing and developing weekly. That was very interesting. My husband read a chapter to me every Sunday night. I also enjoyed HypnoBirthing: A Celebration of Life. I did Hypnobirthing with the birth of my second child. It was AMAZING. No drugs, completely relaxed and a totally different experience than the first."
1,Get a REAL book,"Unfortunately, this book is appropriately named - it indeed trains you on ""what to expect"" - instead of teaching you how to expect better! I never recommend this book to participants in my childbirth class. Dr. Sears has great books and so does Sheila Kitzinger and Penny Simkin."
1,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"The book is a little informative but, unrealistic, not my type of book. I don't recommend it to anyone!"
3,A lot of unnecessary scare,"Althoug this is the one you hear about over and over again, I have heard several doctors advise against it... now I know why. It is a lot of unnecessarily scary stories and ""what ifs."" There are many better books out there. My personal favorite was the new one put out by the Mayo clinic."
4,Great for pregnancy,I originally bought this book for my 1st pregnancy & it was a great guide month to month. I bought it again for my 3rd pregnancy & I still liked it for refresher info. I recomend this book if you are in your 1st pregnancy.
2,Confusing and Unorganized,"This book is not one I would ever recommend for someone to buy. The whole book is a book of questions and answers, which makes it very hard to find information. And the authors deal with topics in later months that can occur a lot earlier! And the questions aren't even ones that apply to a lot of people. For example, most of Chapter 3 deals with alcohol, smoking and drug use during pregnancy. It even has someone asking a question about occasional cocaine use!!!! Since books are usually arranged by topics of most importance, I certainly hope that the 3rd most important topic on my mind during my pregnancy wouldn't be occasional cocaine use!!! I wish I could take this book back!!!!"
3,Proceed with a grain of salt,"I have had one prior miscarriage. I obtained my copy of WTEWYE for that first pregnancy. It was useful then for someone who had no idea of what she was facing. On my second pregnancy, because of my age and my fear of another miscarriage, I have found much better pregnancy guides with more information and less rabid recommendations about what to avoid and what to eat. However, it is a good general guide and should be used with another resource."
2,Buy other books to accompany this one.,"It might be the first book you buy, but it shouldn'tbe the only book you acquire; I agree with those whofind it filled with ""gloom-and-doom"". For instance,""What To Expect"" tells you how to cheat on their""Best-Odds Diet"" - you *can* eat sweets, but onlyif they're low fat and good for you! Also, yoursymptoms' timeline may not mimic the timelinein the text (or for that matter in anyone's text,)so following the ""What to Expect""'s tenets religiouslycould cause you a great deal of anxiety if,say, you experience fatigue during your wholepregnancy instead of feeling a renewed senseof energy in the fourth or fifth month.Try Vicki Iovine's ""The Girlfriends' Guideto Pregnancy"" for the sense of ""everyone'sdifferent, but you'll most likely do okay""that's missing in ""What to Expect""."
2,"Answers some questions, but leaves alot to be desired.","Though this book is given to pregnant women by many doctors andinsurance companies, it is not a comprehensive guide to pregnancyand childbirth. The format is easy to read, and gives you thebasics for what is happening each month. From talking to manypregnant women, I've heard that this book only begins to answertheir many questions, and I felt the same way. If you have atextbook pregnancy, and believe that doctors are gods,then this is the only book for you. Otherwise, read it yes, butmake sure you are reading other books too."
1,Would be fathers avoid,Completely agree with Ron Sullivan's take on this book. Would recommend Babyhood as a far more useful resource.
1,What to expect when you're BRAINDEAD,"Is it me? This book seems to be written at the 5th grade level. I would only recommend this to a 16 year old pregnant teenager. Wait, bad idea...she would likely read this propaganda, be so terrified of the beautiful natural experience she is about to go through that she would hate and fear pregnancy. I can't understand why this is the difinitive book to buy when you're pregnant. It is even printed poorly on pulp-ey looking paper with no color. Please do yourself a favor and get ""Pregnancy and Birth - Your Questions Answered"" They even talk to you as if you were an adult!"
1,Major Disappointment!,"When I got pregnant the first time, I was given a copy of ""What to Expect"". I stopped reading it very early on... talk about a dooms-day book! That book was filled with negative situations, instructed you to follow crazy diets (which makes you feel bad for NOT following them), and, again, I didn't think that a monthly update of what's going on was nearly often enough. It was good as a reference occasionally (when I needed to look something up), but didn't really have any information that I couldn't have gotten on a reputable medical website or by a quick call to my doctor.Like others have said, I TOTALLY do NOT understand why this book is known as the book that every pregnant woman should have! It will drive you crazy! Instead of continuing with this book, I bought ""Your Pregnancy Week-By-Week"" and LOVED it! In fact, I liked it so much, I'm reading it again with my second pregancy and have bought it as a gift for many expecting moms since discovering the book."
1,This book is misleading,"I found much of the information in this book to be misleading or wrong. If you're really wanting to do what is best for you and for your baby, read another book. I suggest skipping this book all together."
1,what to expect when expecting,i didnt like this bookto many bad listing in the beingturned me away from it
5,Very thourough,"I bought this book to read not because I am pregnant, just because I was interested in being prepared for later. This book amazed me. It was very thourough without being too technical. I would recommend it for anyone even thinking of having children or anyone interested in pregnancy itself. I am definitly going to buy the books following (What to expect the first year, and Toddler years). This book had so much information that I will read it over again when I do become pregnant."
3,Too many simple solutions,"I have started calling this my Nazi book --- there are too simplistic solutions to pregnancy symptoms. According to this book, most issues/symptoms can be resolved through the ""Odds-On Diet"" and relaxing. Considering that the Odd-On Diet is very reductionistic and relaxing (while working full-time outside or inside of the home) is just not going to happen easily, I would suggest the authors provide some other advice. It appears that the Odds-On Diet is the cure for any pregnant woman --- which is extrememly inflexible and unrealistic. While I dutifully purchased this book (doesn't everyone seem to have it these days), and there is some good information broken down by month, the dialogue is not that helpful."
3,"Comprehensive, but doesn't cover everything","While I found this book very useful and very helpful, it didn't have information about the biggest problem I had during my pregnancy--severe morning sickness. I lost 20 pounds in the first six months because I was constantly nauseaous and had almost a total aversion to food. This book prides itself on being very comprehensive, but didn't cover this problem. The information about prenatal tests was helpful, though, and we used it to help us make some important decisions. I also felt the tone was good--not patronizing, demeaning, or too advanced. Overall, a good book, but there are some gaps."
2,Scared me more than helped me,"I am just under 2 months pregnant and after eagerly reading this book, I was calling my OB night and day for reassurance that I wasn't miscarrying. WTE does have some good basic answers to common questions, but in general, is too alarmist in tone. Several doctors have told me that they don't recommend the book (someone gave it to me as a gift and I don't plan to pass it along to other friends -- I will pass along 'Girlfriend's Guide' -- lots of fun and honest too!"
2,"Try Colonero's ""With You and Your Baby All the Way"" instead","This book is condescending and alarmist. Instead of having to buy this book as well as ""What to Expect the First Year"", try Colonero's ""With You and Your Baby All the Way"". Colonero's book covers pregnancy, delivery, recovery AND baby care, including a great section on breasfeeding. And it's tone is straightforward and intelligent."
4,"Great book, do not follow the diet if it is not for you!","I hear a lot of women say that the diet part of this book is too unrealistic...So do not follow the diet part! (They call them GUIDELINES for a reason). This book is very informative. It was one of many resources I had available and I went back to it time and time again. No one book is going to suit every woman, but this one came pretty close to discussing every question I had."
3,No ONE book has everything,"I have found parts of the book excellent, but I wish they would refer to weeks instead of months, like everyone else does. But, the book answers questions that haven't been answered in other books, and I'm fortunate that my friends have a diverse collection to lend me. The authors are absolutely obsessive about food, and never do define the phrase ""natural goodness"". In my experience, people who refer to ""natural goodness"" usually are not well informed about human nutrition. So I've dispensed with much of their dietary advice. There is no way I can adhere to that diet and yet I know I am eating healthily - just not by their definition!I"
3,Kind of Indifferent,"I was given this book at my first doctors appointment after I found out I was pregnant. I liked other books that I bought much better, and would not reccommend buying this one for yourself. I did look up a couple things, but it was to compare to things I read in other books or when I had a question. The diet they expect you to be on is a complete joke, and the book has kind of a preaching tone to it."
2,Oh Please,"There are 6 Billion people on the earth right now. What percentage of their mothers followed the ""Best Odds Diet""? This book has some OK information. However, if you are plaqued by morning sickness as I have been for 6 months, you can't follow any diet. While I do refer to this book, I roll my eyes at other parts. I would like to see one medical study that backs up the authors' claims that if you gain weight on healthy food you will have a big healthy baby, but if you gain weight on other food you will have a small baby. The book is just OK, and I wouldn't consider it an authoritative work, as there really isn't medical back up for the statements."
2,Written in the dark ages,"As first time parents, we had a lot of questions when we found out we were pregnant...this was the first book we bought because it came highly recommended. This book provided some good information, but was divided up month by month, which I found disappointing and not very helpful. Plus, some of the advice, topics, etc I couldn't relate to, I felt that the book was written more for earlier generations than the current one. The Best Odds Diet is a JOKE...you spend more time planning every meal than you do anything else, it just wasn't possible for me to follow all the ""rules"" this book set for me. After seriously distressing me with the diet and it's scary ""what can go wrong"" topics, I decided to put this book up back on my shelf at the advice of my doctor and mom. Skip it."
2,It may actually be OK.,"Although I feel there were many valid points in this book, I feel as though it scares many new expectant mothers. There were several times reading the book, that a symptom that is very normal, appeared horrific and I was forced to call my doctor to question what I was feeling. I realize the book is trying to help mothers understand what is going on in their bodies, but I feel as though the book should have made more clear distinctions about what is normal and what is excessive and worrisome. It can make you a paranoid pregnant woman."
2,"Not what I had expected,","this book oversimplified our wondrous experience. It is also extremely conservative in its views, makes a future mother feel strange if she is not experiencing any of the topics discussed. Really not the best book out there - too informative on alarmist issues needlessly, and not informative enough about how the baby is growing and what that can cause the mother to feel."
2,treats you like an imbecile,"This book, though recommended frequently, makes you feel guilty and unsure of everything you do.First, the nutrition guidelines are ridiculously rigid. The last straw for me was when they suggested that I bring my own wheat roll to business luncheons so I wouldn't eat the white ones.The other thing that bugs me is that they really insult my intelligence. Telling me that its ok to shave my legs! The phrase ""consult your practitioner"" must be in there about a thousand times.Also, knowing how common miscarriages are, I found it peculiar that they did not address m/cs in the first ""What you may be concerned about"" section.Everyone tells you to get this book, but I think it is highly overrated."
2,Least helpful of pregnancy books I've read!,"I found this book to be short on really useful information. The ""expectations"" for each month were nearly identical and the tone often depressing. After reading this book you will wonder why it is you wanted to be pregnant in the first place.If you want a thorough and helpful book on pregnancy, with discussions on possible complications without raising undue alarm, with answers to all of the 1,000 questions every pregnant woman has, then buy ""Your Pregnancy Week by Week."""
2,"It has the basics, but....","While this book gives good information about, say, the sizeof the fetus and some possible symptoms of pregnancy(as well as what they might mean), it had a really narrow approach to pregnancy and some unlikely solutions to problems. For example, in the chapter on colds and flu during pregnancy, one recommended remedy was hot diluted orange juice. If you're not throwing up from morning sickness or the flu, hot diluted orange juice will definitely upset your stomach! I also disliked the ""Do it our way or no way"" attitude. Overall, I'd say this book created almost as much anxiety in me as it relieved."
1,A little too emotional,"After reading this book and several others, I really think this book tries to be too 'touchy-feely' rather than give just hard facts. Maybe it is just me, but I'm more interested in science and fact rather than emotion when it comes to pregnancy. I know how I'm feeling...I don't need to know how other women are feeling."
2,Not what I was expecting.,"This book was just given to me by a friend. It's my second pregnancy book and I was so excited to have a new one to read, I just ran home and started right away. Man was I disappointed. I feel judged by this book. It makes me more paranoid than anything and I'm pretty much bored out of my mind. This all from someone who usually loves to absorb anything pregnancy related, even before becoming pregnant. I've tried to give it more than one chance and was even told by my Doctor to stop reading it since I'm losing sleep over it. The only good thing about this book is the amount of information. So if you enjoy a dry, boring, judgemental read, then I recommend this."
2,bad advice,"My guess is that the impressive size of this book (aproximatley 600 pages) is what draws people to buy it. Well size isn't everything, especially not in this case.It is important to keep a healthy diet during pregnancy, but the diet this book suggests is insane. No one could follow it. Half a bagel as a treat? Vegetarian sushi is only okay as long as you opt for low sodium soy sauce? If I had miscarried, and my only source of information was this book, I would have assumed my miscarrige was caused by some trivial dietary mistake, and never have forgiven myself.The diet isn't the only thing about this book that is ridiculous, for one, the book suggests that if you are in active labor you should pass the time by cooking casseroles for your mate. Suuure....I'll get right on that..maybe I should carry a mop into the kitchen with me so I can mop my amniotic fluid off the floor while I'm cooking."
3,To preachy and scary for me,"Everyone says that this is the book to have when your pregnant. I personally am sorry that I bought it. Now I have fears and worries that I didnt have before. Not to mention I didnt appreciate being talked down to...I recommend instead ""Ä Girl Friends Guide to pregnancy"" and ""babytales: A Pregnancy Companion"" These books were enjoyable plus they helped guide me through my pregnancy. ""Babytales...has become a favorite book of 2002."
2,pregnancy diet is too complicated,"I bought this book because my husband use to work at a bookstore and he had told me this was a best seller. Now I wish I did more research. This book is very informative in a month by month of your pregnancy in a FAQ format. Although, I didn't really care for this format. It feels disorganized to me, and I don't really care for the text book approach. As a first time mother, I like to hear about other mothers and their experience. But you will not get that here. This book is informative rather than encouraging or supportive as the other books. I would also have enjoyed more pictures. My biggest problem with this book was the diet they suggested you follow. It was too detailed and complicated. Too difficult to follow, especially for someone who never thought twice to what she ate before she became pregnant. I found the pamphlet that the doctor gave to me much more useful."
3,Thorough but bossy,"This book gives you everything you need to know, and lots that you don't! And it's so bossy and opinionated. For a good laugh, I loved the parody of this book, ""Expect the Unexpected When You're Expecting!"" by Glick, et. al."
5,A Must have,I always wanted this book. Now on my fourth child I'm greatful for the info that I have found in this book. The info has been great and I found that I find out things I didn't know. A first time mom to be would find this book great or any mom to be.
5,This book held me back form calling my doctor every 5 minutes!,"As a woman with an 8 week old., I can't tell you how much I referred to this book. It was so exciting to get to every new month of pregnancy and read it. I never allowed myself to go ahead of where I was out. So it was always a special treat when I reched a new month to read a new chapter! This book has so much information. I walked into all of my doctors appointments prepared. It's the one book to have on your bed stand!"
2,Agony,"Guys - if someone told you to buy this in order to be a supportive husband, then, like me, you'll do it regardless of this review. Yes, it contains useful information about pregnancy, but if you are like me then picking it up will be more labor than delivery of your child. The authors' problem is trying to cover every conceivable ache and pain associated with pregnancy, and there are ALOT, and provide a technical explanation while dumbing it down so the average kindergartener would not get overwhelmed reading it. There are much better books on the market; save your cash."
2,Expect to feel GUILTY if you read this book,"Although this book is somewhat informative, for the first four months of my pregnancy I felt like a failure! My husband hid this book from me because I constantly worried about miscarriage, diet, etc. I am a very healthy woman who has gained ""more than my share"". I think the diet advice and weight restrictions are totally ridiculous and unrealistic and I would not recommend this patronizing excuse for a pregnancy guide to anyone who is having a baby. This book has sent me in tears more than once to my OB/GYN because as a normal, working, first-time expectant mother I simply cannot live up to these rigid guidelines. Only when I stopped reading ""What to expect..."" did I feel more relaxed and confident in my role as an expectant mother, and I stopped obsessing over my baby's well-being. My advice? Trash it and get Dr. Miriam Stoppard's ""Conception, Pregnancy, and Childbirth""."
5,THE book for the brave and curious!,"I read alot of the reviews about this book, and I'm glad I didn't listen to them. This is a great book! I read it every day. True, it has a lot of information that you may never need about complications, but I'm just curious, and not easily spooked, so I enjoyed learning. It also breaks down pregnancy into every stage which helps you prepare for what's next. So what if the author is a little biased towards health food? When you're pregnant, EVERYONE has an opinion, and feels they can just give it to you, so this is nothing different. I just ignored the opinions, and used the information that seemed helpful. A good resource!"
2,Don't waste your money,"This book is a big disappointment. It reads like it was written by editors for a teen magazine. Its endless use of acronyms, abbreviations and euphemisms are terribly annoying. The information in the book is geared more towards women interested in a more modern approach to childbirth as opposed to those looking for a natural alternative. There are some bits of useful information, but most of it can be found on the author's website. Why buy the book when you can access the same information for free?"
4,Good information,"I like the book, it's a good series for general rules or troubleshooting problems with raising a child. My only real complaint is that you can read one passage saying one thing and another two pages later saying the opposite. For me it's a general how you can run your life, not a ""this is how to parent"" type of book. Best part is trouble shooting issues with my newborn.I guess if my wife didn't think the book was the end all be all I'd be happier with it. It's not fun saying you read something and then being told the book said otherwise, and having to go back and forth to say ""It's up to us to decide what to do, not the book"" and cross referencing the differences to answer questions."
5,"Give it to a New ""Mom""","A must have for new mom's.. just as long as you remember, all the information in this book does not apply to every pregnancy.. it's a reference book, and you can't learn everything from a book... ask your Mom :-)"
2,Scared me away from pregnancy,"I bought this book when one of my friends became pregnant and, after reading it, I told my husband there was no way I was ever going to be pregnant. The demands that this book puts upon a pregnant woman are unbearable, and the guilt that is not-so-subtly applied if you don't follow the rules in the book is immense. After reading many other books (that were happier, and much truer to life, like, believe it or not, ""Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy"") and feeling better prepared for what it was like for ""real"" people, we did decide we were prepared to have a baby. While I was pregnant, I used the ""What to Expect"" book when I wanted to look up something specifically, but I refused to use it as any sort of a holistic guide and would really not recommend it at all. If you are looking for a much more empowering alternative, you should really consider ""The Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth"" by Sheila Kitzinger."
4,Great reference if you can take it with a grain of salt,"I read this book cover to cover and constantly referred to it while I was pregnant and in the first couple weeks after my daughter was born. That said, I think you need to remember that the author also addresses what COULD happen worst case scenario issues. Whether or not it actually happens to you, you should still be informed about it. The problem with this book is that it can make any first time mom completely paranoid and neurotic if she doesn't take what the author says with a grain of salt. My husband actually refused to read this book after he read the first trimester because he was so freaked out about what 'could' go wrong. It is a good book, but don't assume everything bad is going to happen to you!"
3,"Helpful, but not the most useful book in my collection...","This book is helpful, and is fairly thorough, but it is a bit out-of-date. I am frustrated by the fact that, as a patient who takes it upon herself to get informed, I have more up-to-date knowledge of certain subjects than this book that many people describe as the Pregnancy Bible. I've found the same problem with the next in the series, What to Expect the First Year. For example, I recently found out that my child is a boy, so I researched circumcision. According to What to Expect..., the AAP advises circumcision but maintains that it's probably ok not to. In fact, the AAP recently adopted a position that advises AGAINST circumcision.In all, this book is a good investment if you plan to read other pregnancy books (or if you get it on sale), but don't rely on it completely."
3,Left a little emplty,"As a first time mother, I found this book very hard to read. There were first trimester symptoms at the back of the book and I felt that everything I was eating was wrong and will harm the baby. I prefer the Week by Week Pregnancy Book by MacDougal. It showed you where you are and what you are experiencing!"
1,"Very disappointing, considering the hype","As all women are instructed to do, the momen I found out I was pregnant I invested in this book. After reading it and a few others, I just don't understand why it is considered such a valuable resource -- I understand that when it first came out, the concept was revolutionary, but since then much more informative, better laid-out books have been written -- most notably, Pregnancy for Dummies, which we find invaluable due to the brilliant indexing of information that allows you to find what you want when you need it, as opposed to forcing to you try and guess what trimester to skim under. I'd love to return the book, but made the mistake of writing in it. What a comparative waste of money!"
2,Maybe this was written for a previous generation?,"I can't help but feel as though this book is trapped in some kind of mysterious time warp, where modern obstetrical technology meets the social values of the 1950's.Some of the Best Odds recipes are pretty good, even if the whole diet is incredibly restrictive, and some of the information about hospital procedures is interesting (if overly weighted toward passive acceptance of whatever someone in a white coat thinks is best for you.)But the section on labor was a trip. Let me get this straight -- after labor starts, but before I go to the hospital, I'm supposed to pass the time by *preparing food for other people*?Yeah, right."
2,"Way over-rated, written by the pregnancy police","My biggest objection to the book is focus on food. Even when you try to look up a complaint (such as diarrea, migraines, etc), they give a one sentence, not very helpful answer, then 3 sentences on how eating the best-odds diet could prevent this (Hint: it can't).They were so fixated on the food/diet aspect that after reading it, and referring to it, I am left with the feeling that a Snickers Bar is the moral equivilant of beer, a slice of Chocolate cake with frosting is a pack of cigarettes, and by eating a Big Mac, Large Fries and Coke, I might as well be shooting heroin.What's lacking in the month-by-month description good information as to what is developing during that period in the baby. What organs are happening? What are the KEY NUTRIENTS that are necessary for that time horizon?A much better book is the weekly calender that really talks about what's happening to you and the fetus, including real pictures, not pencil sketches."
1,"condescending, scary, and a waste of money","Just want to cast my vote against this one because I'd love to help someone choose a better book. Don't know why this book is so popular; the whole tone of the book is alarmist and preachy. (Heaven forbid you eat something other than whole-grain) The Dr. Sears book is MUCH better for giving you the information you need to make your own choices and for treating you like an intelligent person!That said, I did like the ""what to expect"" organizer which is a collection of handy charts and calendars."
2,Aren't women making their own choices these days?,"This book's information was really outdated. You can tell it was written long ago, before women really had much of a say in things. If you go by everything the book says, the next nine months will be miserable. You will basically shut up, listen to your doctor and accept his word as law. You will never eat what you crave, and you will never be an active participant in your own baby's birth. This is good for general information, but if you really want to make informed decisions, look elsewhere."
2,How to make a pregnant woman even more neurotic...,"As a physician, I went into my first pregancy with a fair bit of ""knowledge"" - but nothing compares to ""the real thing!"" This book does have lots of information in it, and covers complications/ problems etc well. However, it could create a huge number of guilty/neurotic/paranoid moms to be with all of the restrictions on diet that it includes. ""The pregnancy diet"" sounds great, but how many servings of orange vs green vegetables do I really need to eat every day, let alone avoiding anything smoked/salted/processed... great if you are already a health nut and eat organic food, but for the rest of the planet, let's get a little more practical! The reality is that babies are the world's best parasites and will take what they need from their ""host"" - which is why malnourished heroin addicted moms can still give birth to 8lb babies!I say it is a good resource, but don't live by it alone or you will go mad!!!"
1,This Book Will Make You Unnecessarily PARANOID!!!,"I hated this book, I felt it was very misleading. The title is appealing, but the book is filled with obscure potential issues, without letting you know just how statistically slight they are. It left me feeling very worried, and I wonder if it was just filler in her book. Pancreatic Cancer? Come on, is this really practical information for most expectant mothers? There are some wonderful books out there, this was not one of them."
1,actualy no stars would be better,"I received this book from my insurance company, to whom I have informed that this book is horrible. I was not 'afraid, or scared' when I was pregnant, as this book suggests all women are. I got thru the first chapter put the book down, went to the library and found much better books. I would strongly suggest finding better books, joining a mom's club and talking to other moms - you will get much better advice from them and your doctor."
5,My wife loves it,"I ordered this book for my wife (our doctor recommended it) and she loves it. Not only does it prepare future mothers for their physical changes, it prepares them mentally as well. We like knowing what to expect and that most pregnant women have the same experiences my wife is having. This is our first child so we aren't exactly sure what to expect, this book really helps prepare us for what's going to ""happen next"". The book is easy to understand and has helpful pictures as well. I would recommend it to any pregnant woman, but especially if you are having your first child."
3,Good as only a reference,"I bought this book because it seemed like one of the staples that you have to get as an expectant mother. I thought it was okay, but not great. On the plus side it is organized in a great way (as opposed to the Girlfriends book)and it does have a lot of information. On the minus side, it may have too much information. By that I mean that it has descriptions and definitions of a lot of scary things that you may never encounter but you might think you are experiencing those things after reading about them. Therefore, I only use this book when I need to look something up. I don't read what could or should happen to you every month because it makes me worry too much. Also, the nutrition section is a total waste. I haven't met one person who has been able to follow the diets that they suggest. They are way too strict about what you shouldn't eat. If I followed their advice I think I'd just be eating nuts and berries."
3,An Encyclopedia - Not a 'Book',"When I became pregnant (it was a SURPRISE!) I was flat out freaked and un-prepared. My loving sister sent me this book because she enjoyed it so, and I'd heard that many other women loved it. I however, did not, at least not during my initial stages of pregnancy.This book does answer every question you could have and that is a good thing. But this book did not offer me what I needed more than text book answers... Emotional Support!!! Buy this book as a medical guide so you have something to refer to when your insensitive OB doesn't have time to answer your questions. For that it is good. Just don't expect this book to give you the assurance about your feelings and emotions that you so much require at this very sensitive time!"
1,"Condescending, alarmist, and narrow-minded","I am afraid the best thing about this book was the title. I actually bought this book, and wish I had read some of the reviews first. The people who call this a ""bible"" really should consider an alternate ""religion"". This is an unbelievably patronizing, misinformed, and alarmist book about a wonderful time in a woman's life. After I read the first couple of chapters, I had to repeat to myself ""Pregnancy is not a disease"" over and over for weeks! And what moron thought of those diet guidelines? What do the authors do for a living that makes them suggest bringing a flask of wheat germ to business luncheons! Get a reality check! The book is so focused on every conceivable crisis that it actually had me worried that I did not have morning sickness instead of enjoying my luck!Don't bother with this. There are better uses for both your time and your money!"
1,An unrealistic approach to pregnancy.,"The book definitely has an alarmist tone. The strict diet was depressing, and the part that bugged me the most was the section on ""Protecting Yourself Against Malpractice"". This is a quote from the page.. ""doctor's are no longer allowing themselves to be sitting ducks while patients take malpractice pot shots at them."" Now I don't know about you, but I'm not going to the doctor hoping to get a malpractice suit, my main concern is my baby. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. It's scary, annoying, and unrealistic."
1,"If you want to feel guilty during your pregnancy, read it.",This book will put your mind to ease on the many changes you go through during pregnancy but beware the pregnancy police is present. The tone and content is condecending and will most likely make you feel very inadequate as a mother to be. There are lots of books out there that will tell you about your pregnant body and your baby that are better than this one.
2,A poorly organized book without much depth,"This book is one of about 10 that I bought or inherited during my pregnancy. This book is EVERYWHERE, I mean right next to the cheap paperbacks in Wal-Mart EVERYWHERE. Basically the book goes over a pregnancy month-by-month, which is useless because it is much more informative to measure one's pregnancy in weeks. The books is organized into corny ""Q & A"" format, with many of the questions being overly specific or non-applicable to all pregnancies. There is not much scientific fact or research in this book, but rather reads as if your grandma's book group is telling you about pregnancy. If you are looking for a book that has credible medical fact and informative information, buy ""The Mayo Clinic Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy"". That book is by far the best, is the most credible and is with the times. Plus, The Mayo Clinic is an incredibly well respected establishment."
1,Pass on this one,"Despite the reviews saying that there were better books out there, my husband and I decided to go ahead and order this one as it was recommended by a friend.After a few uses, I began to reference this book as the ""scary"" book. We decided that the information the book contained was not worth the anxiety it produced and shoved it to the back of a closet...never to be seen or heard from again. We used the Mayo Clinic's Guide to a Healthy Pregnancy for the remainder of the pregnancy and it was fabulous.We received the ""What to Expect the First Year"" as a shower gift. While it's not the same scary book as ""Expecting,"" I can't say I appreciate its holier-than-thou attitude toward many subjects."
3,Organizational issues,I am going through my first pregnancy and purchased this book. I haven't been so concerned about the militant regime the author would like you to follow as I am with the lack of organization of the book. Why doesn't the author create a chapter addressing questions about pregnancy in the back of the text instead of interspersing them throughout? It is very difficult to reference them later.
2,"Buy ""Babytales"" or ""Girlfriends guide to pregnancy"" instead","I found ""What to expect when expecting"" to be pretenious, condecendind, and extremely negative. Yeah its true that this book may be loaded with a lots of needed information...and it may have its place in the world of pregnancy, but this is not the kind of book that a first time mom to be should be reading. This book will take a young woman, who is alread afraid, and instill more fear in her. It will talk down to her, and then make her feel insecure about the whole experience. I will not recommend this book at all. ""Babytales: A Pregnancy companion"", by M.S.Woodson and ""The Girlfriends Guide to..."", by Vicki Iovine - are much better choices."
2,Morning Sickness is all in my head?,"I have to say, that although this book is a good reference for the many random questions that women have throughout pregnancy, I found it to be demeaning in tone. Having suffered from severe morning sickness, vomiting all day for 5 weeks straight (and feeling generally horrible for 4 weeks after that), that I was extremely offended not only at the shortness of the section dealing with this common and miserable condition but also at the suggestion that its all in my head! I felt like throwing the book across the room when I looked to it for comfort and support and all it offered me was a paragraph about how women with morning sickness tend to be succeptible to the power of suggestion. Excuse me??????"
1,For your sanity and health stay far away from this book,"This is a horrible book. It has caused 3 meltdowns until I finnaly got wise and closed it permanently. I have fourth edition. If there were an option I would give it negative stars. The first chapter is entitled ""Are you Pregnant?"" subcategory, ""What you may be concerned about."" Personally the first thing I did when I found out, was rejoice. Not worry. Reading that chapter only put silly ideas (that have absolutely nothing to do with my pregancy) in my head to worry about. The part about toxoplasmosis is the worst, I came out of it positive that because I have 2 affectionate INDOOR cats, I was going to kill my fetus and endanger my health. I suggest that only the severely masochistic read this. I do not understand how this came to be the commonest pregnancy book. I am apalled."
1,Great Book If You Want To Freak Your Wife Out,"A friend gave this book to my wife. She started reading it and I got busy with work. I came back a little while later to find her in tears. When I asked what was wrong, she replied ""I'm just so scared"" and then proceeded to quote all the things this book said could go wrong with her pregnancy.If you really care about someone, their happiness, and hope they have a low-stress pregnancy then do NOT get them this book."
2,"not the ""be all to end all.""","""What to Expect When You're Expecting"" has a lot of contradictions in advice, which turned myself and my husband off. The ""worst case scenarios"" got to be really old as well. To be honest, I haven't opened this book since week 4 and we're at week 16.The book my husband and I preferred was ""Pregnancy- Week by Week."" We have gotten into the habit of snuggling together, as my husband reads about what changes are occurring for this particular week."
1,C-sections mommies beware of unrealistic advice,"According the the WTE series you can expect ""little or no pain"" during your recovery from a C-section. Are they SERIOUS? C-sections are major abdominal surgery, recovery is painful and most moms will need to take somewhat strong pain relievers for a week or two to even hold their beautiful newborn for any length of time. Ther is nothing wrong with admitting you are in pain, especially if you were surprised by an emergency c-section, and taking care of yourself during recovery. If mom is more relaxed and comfortable and following her doctor's orders, the baby can only benefit."
2,Disapointing,I had far from a perfect pregnancy and I still felt that this book did not live up to the hype. Much of the useful information in it could be found in the info packet my dr's gave me. It actually contained information and sugestions that went specifically against what my dr's told me. Many of the topics covered in this book are both frightening and dated. I would recomend staying away form this one and getting Your Pregnancy Week by Week and a technical reference and The Girlfriend's Guide and a practical one. This book is actually the only one I did not save to loan to friends. Instead I tell them not to buy it.
1,"Difficult to read, outdated, opinionated","This book seems like it's from the '50s -- diet advice that you could only follow if you didn't work outside the home and lived next door to the store and had a maid, fear-mongering, and just basically wrong information. I would recommend that you go to the library and check several books out on pregnancy, and select the one that fits your lifestyle the best. Try ""The Girlfriend's Guide"" and ""The Pregnancy Book"" for starters. There are a ton of better books out there."
2,Too preachy and condescending,"When I was pregnant I asked my OB to recommend a book, and he said ""anything BUT What to Expect ..."". In my opinion, there was some good info, but the tone of the book overall was way too self-righteous, especially regarding the off-the-planet diet info. Get the Mayo Clinic's excellent book for medical info (also has part of the book devoted to the baby's first year), and Vicki Iovine's ""Girlfriend's Guide"" for laughs. You wouldn't want the What to Expect authors as girlfriends - they will sprinkle wheat germ all over you while reprimanding you for eating that extra scoop of chocolate ice cream."
2,"Some useful info, lots of patronizing attitude","You might as well ask your mother in law for advice, because the ladies who wrote this book are sure that they know it all too- and that you just might be too stupid to understand it. I think the last straw was when I looked up nosebleeds occuring during pregnancy and they said something like this ""blowing ones nose correctly is an art, one that you would do well to master..."" Hey! I thought I was the mommy here!If you must buy it, buy it used, enough people want to get rid of this book and you will get a good deal."
1,An extremely over-rated book,"It seems like this is the book of choice to give to people as soon as you find out they're pregnant. Too bad, because there are much better ""pregnancy-survival"" books out there.I found that very little of what this book said actually applied to me. It is written from a very paranoid standpoint, and it seems to focus on everything that can go wrong during a pregnancy. I found that it made me more depressed and fearful, so I quit reading it during my fifth month.A much better book is ""Natural Pregnancy"" by Aviva Jill Romm. I also really like ""The Birth Book"" by William and Martha Sears, so I would bet that their ""The Pregnancy Book: A Month-By-Month Guide"" would be better than the ""Expecting"" book."
1,Don't Buy It!,"I'm sorry I wasted my money on this book. Their advice for if you have a craving for a cookie? ""Eat a fruit-juice sweetened bran muffin!"" If you gain more than 25 pounds on the dot, watch out. You'll have the daylights scared out of you by this book about all the potential health risks. My midwife told me she always tries to catch her patients before they buy this book and warn them NOT to (she goes so far as to call it misogynistic) but unfortunately she didn't get me in time. I would recommend a more relaxed, more helpful book like ""Spiritual Midwifery."""
2,Preachy Preachy Preachy,"I'm 1/3 of the way through my first pregnancy and find the diet portion of this book to be way too preachy. I believe in eating a balanced diet, but can't imagine finding the time and energy to follow the recommended diet. And a piece of cake once a month as a treat? Let's get real, even pre-pregnancy diet allows for more realism than that.Other than diet, the information is okay, but the Q&A don't always appear during the right secion as different people experience different symptoms at different times.I much prefer the ""Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby."" It's friendlier, easier to use and far less preachy. You actually feel like you're doing an okay job of taking care of your body and your baby, even if you drink a Coke a week!"
1,Worst guide on expecting,"This book was not what I thought it would be when I bought it. I felt like the book was more of an ""older"" view on pregnancy and that I should be sitting at home reading all day long waiting for my husband to come home so I could make him dinner and that I had no earthly business wearing anything but granny underwear. The book didn't say that, but I didn't feel like it really applied to the younger and more modern mothers that are out there. There are other books that are much better"
2,Why is this so popular?,"I have no idea why this book is so popular. Although it contains good information, there are plenty of other books that do as well. I find the tone of the book a bit condescending. Reading this book, you'd think having a few potato chips would mean you're baby will be obese and you will have stretch marks and varicose veins, yet if you eat perfectly, everything will go perfectly. I exercies regularly and eat healthfully, yet I still find the tone offensive. I felt this book would leave most mothers paranoid about every little thing. Also, I wasn't that happy with the layout and how info is organized. I am much, much happier with the Mayo Clinic guide. The Mother of All Pregnancy Books is good, too--just as much info, but more realistic. If you must use this book, get it from the library and save your money to buy the Mayo Clinic guide."
5,Klasse twins rock,"I will keep this short and sweet. Used the twins after a good wash and Mothers Clay bar, and all I can say is my 12 year old Integra gleams. Put a coat of DP MaxWax on top and boom shine like never before. Two thumbs up for the Klasse twins worth the time and money for sure."
5,Worth the effort.,"I have always used over the counter polishes, and I suppose they did an adequate job. After getting a newer vehicle, I wanted to try some higher-end products. The Klasse products went on relatively easy, and I can tell a difference both by feel and sight. I also used it on an older vehicle after first using a silicone rubbing compound. I clay barred both, and picked up a good bit of grime. I don't plan on doing that every time, but I wanted the best foundation I could the first time. I have also adopted the two-bucket method of washing (one for a good soap - not dishwashing liquid, and one for rinsing), from top down. If you're willing to invest a little more time and effort, the final outcome is worth it. Also, I wanted to mention that the vendor, Palm Beach, was very helpful in re-routing my order so I could get my package by the weekend."
5,Outstanding shine !!!,"I have never seen a car polish product with this kind of fantastic result.The process is extremely easy. Just make sure your vehicle is as clean as you can possibly get it, then apply the product according to the manufacture's instructions. It is VERY easy to do. I first used it on my wife's 97 Lexus.It looks better than new, I kid you not. It has been several weeks and I still can't get over the shine. You have to try this product ! I am not affiliated with this company in any way other than being a very satisfied customer."
1,look for pyschology for science and how did that person disc,look for pyscholoy for science and how did dicovery i
3,It's TMNT arcade with super heroes.,"My biggest hope and biggest let down about this game is that it would play just like the PS2 version. There was no description about the game to tell me any different. But the gameplay itself was not too bad. If you have ever played Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles arcade the you know how this game is played. The different levels are redudant with only the storyline to indicate the difference. Its a pretty good game. The sad thing is that once I beat it after the first week I got it, I haven't touched it since."
2,Bummed.,"While the graphics were pretty good, this game was far too easy. Most characters played the same but with a different face. I played it on and off for a week and was surprised when I beat it. That was it?VERY disappointing."
1,Can't believe that Marvel would even license this just to make a buck,Terrible game. Controls are very jerky during the fights. Very short sequences. Graphics are ok but could be better (Dragon Ball GT had better graphics and controls). Bought it because of the Marvel name. Big mistake.Haven't played the other console versions but its pretty obvious that the developer didnt really spend that much time on the GBA version.
4,"Colorful, with a Unique Setting for Children","The BIG Fish is a story of hopes and dreams of a young girl, but the setting for the story is what intrigued me and my grandson the most. He had not read of children of the Frozen North, so this was a new experience for him. Indeed, this is the story of a dream come true, and believing in oneself, but at the same time, exposes children to the idea of a small child living in an Eskimo Village - all children in this world have dreams. The illustrations are beautifully done, with gorgeous colours throughout. Very clever and unusual in it's setting."
4,This is one I missed...,"Sorry I missed Harry O when it ran on television, but enjoyed this pilot and now am watching theseries' episodes. David Janssen was a fine actor and the writing for these episodes was prettygood."
5,Did the job beautifully,"This was the router bit I needed. It did the job I needed in a flash. It appears well-made; the packaging was simple, the price was good, and the shipping was very fast. Next time I need a new router bit, I'll go with this brand and vendor."
5,Highly recommend this one.,"Hard to recommend this only because it is a dark read that takes you totally out of your element. (Well outta mine anyway.) Very well written and not a boring or slow minute. I love how it turns and takes me with it. Awesome book. If you like thisone you LOVE Captive in the dark, a two book series. READ READ READ Judgement."
1,Violent and mindless,"I decided to read this because another reviewer likened it to Kitty Thomas's Comfort Food, which I really enjoyed....I didn't enjoy this one though- not at all. The main thing I detested is that you never get into the minds of the captors- they're all portrayed as hardened sadists with no compassion. There's a lot of punishment and not much insight in to the characters personalities (or lack there of) or motivations. Comfort Food gave me a lot to think about...this one went out of my mind immediately, thankfully."
5,"When I read this book, I'm deeply moved--usually to tears!","I too have read all of Susan Howatch's novels about the Church of England, including a seventh, The Wonder Worker, an unexpected and wonderful gift from the author to her fans. But it is Absolute Truths to which I keep returning at least once a year. What a beautifully and deeply moving story--of a character, Charles Ashworth, who wasn't my favorite throughout the other five novels. I always have a great cry when I read this novel and this time I've been moved to do something more--to begin a ladies prayer group. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, Susan Howatch. Yes, you can read this book simply for entertainment or distraction. But it will reach deep into your soul anyway!"
2,"If you need a destressing thing, you must buy this!",I was so destressed solving the reading part of this book. They are unbelievably difficult. My husband also said that the reading should be on S.A.T. there were no prinscription explaining the answers. I couldn't figure out why I got wrong for a lot of questions!
2,This book is NOT for the new computer TOEFL!,"Kaplan is trying to trick you with the title!It is NOT for the new computer test and it will NOT prepare you for the CBT TOEFL.Instead, you should try to find the Longman CBT book. It is much better!"
2,NOT for the Computer TOEFL; TOO Simple; NOT Much Info!,"The CD-ROM with book has NO computer practice! It only has the listening section. The grammar review is much, much too short and does not have enough exercises--most students need much more practice.Furthermore, many of the questions use language that is TOO SIMPLE, in other words, you will not see this type of question on the real test.Finally, the explanations seem to be written for native speakers of English; if you still have difficulty with English, some of the explanations will be hard to understand.There are better choices available."
2,Attention-only one practice test that is not CAT,The CD-ROM doesn't contain a CAT-test and doesn't work fin
3,Helpful but general,"This book is a GREAT resource for those who are new to the audtioning process, or have not had a lot of classes that prepare one for audtions. It gives some great basic tips--things every actor should know before going out on an audtion. Most of it seemed like information that should be a no-brainer to most actors. There was a great section on breathing--I would recomend that to anyone!"
5,It Works!,"I gave this book to a friend as a gift. He read it and applied a lot of the relaxation techniques before going into an audition. Of course there's no way to know whether or not the book's responsible for his success, but he seems to think it's helpful in getting him some commercial callbacks. There are a lot of tips in it that people don't usually think about -- like remembering to breathe (!).I'd highly recommend this as a stocking stuffer for the aspiring actor or actress in your life."
4,Essential little book...,"This ""pint sized"" book is a wonderful aide in helping those of us who are poor spellers. It is difficult to look up the correct spelling of a word, when you don't know how to spell it correctly, or even close to correctly, to begin with. This book is the answer to that problem.I only wish it contained more words."
2,print to small,I can see that there is a lot of information contained in a small book. The problem is the print is so small I can't read it.
1,"Bought two, both broke almost immediately","These are a great idea, but the quality is really lousy. I bought two tops for Christmas -- one for each of my toddler grandsons. They were great and the boys really liked them. Unfortunately, the first one stopped working about three days after Christmas -- when you push down on the handle, the handle just drops down inside and doesn't spin the top. The second one lasted until about a week after New Year, then the same thing happened. When I was a kid, we had a top (by a different manufacturer) that lasted forever. I think it was still working when I was a young adult -- so there's no reason for these to have broken other than bad quality control. I plan to write to the manufacturer, but meanwhile, I wouldn't recommend spending the money on these things."
3,Doesn't spin true,"I had wanted to order this from Amazon for my grandson, but they were sold out and I refused to pay $63 for the same item from another seller on their site. Instead I bought a new one on Ebay for $11.95 plus shipping. Am pleased with the price but not the quality of the toy. Wobbles and does not hum very loud. I remember them humming louder - anyway mine did."
1,This seller is trying to scam you...,I just bought this same this from amazon more then a month ago..for only ten dollars...and you can find this other places..it is a wonderful toy and my spins solid and is very loud whistling but do not buy here!!!
1,good god,"this is the worst cd i've ever heard...id rather buy a 10 cd boxed set of various tracks containing hours and hours of nails against chalkboards...this ""band"" is so bad they cant even use being girls as an excuse...even KITTIE, the runners-up for worst band ever, are legendary compared to this atrocity. even the suicidal should stay clear of this beer coaster!"
4,Good accessible edition,"This is a generally good and easily available, inexpensive edition of Marlowe's plays. My only reservation about it is Steane's edition of Dr. Faustus. He makes the worst of both major texts, taking the general outline from the 1616 text but throwing in a lot of corrupt scraps from the 1604 edition for the clown scenes. I would advise anyone who wants to read Dr. Faustus to look elsewhere. I'm convinced that the 1604 version is on the whole a corrupt and truncated version of the play, but if you prefer it you might look into the Folger Library edition. If on the other hand you would rather read the play more or less as I think Marlowe wrote it, try the Signet edition edited by Sylvan Barnet.The other plays present no major textual problems (except for The Massacre at Paris, which is pretty hopeless) and this is a fine place to meet them."
5,Destined to become a cult classic,"This book can bring back memories of this dificult time when we only had each other, when we were able to show affection, comfort each other and even express our sexual beings. We not only found company, we also found love of the heart. Otherwise we would have gone crazy."
5,Book Purchase and Delivery,"""At Ease"" is an excellent collection of rarely seen photos. I am enjoying it very much. It was delivered as promised, new, and in a very timely fashion."
1,Didn't Work,"Piece of junk! I ended up re-buying this locally. I'm not saying the brand was junk, who sold it to me is in question. It was obvious this didn't work."
4,"review of ""Tin Huey""","Exactly what it was supposed to be-""I could rule the world"" beats the Waitresses version.Good!"
5,Michael W. Smith does it again.,"I'm really starting to like this guy! This Is Your Time is another powerful album by this artist. As a husband and new father I can appreciate his songs he wrote to his wife and children. This is an album about life and living a good life. Michael doesn't preach to you, he just shares his enjoyment of life with you."
5,A must have album!,"For most of Michael W. Smith's (Smitty) fans, this November, 1999 release is not considered to be one of his best. Many of them feel like it is a let down from the previous year's ""Live The Life"" album. Any maybe they are right. But in my opinion, ""This Is Your Time"" IS one of his best.Named for the title track, which was written in honor of Cassie Bernall's brave admission to the Columbine killers, this was not an album made for the purpose of racking up sales. Instead, this was an album made for the purpose of sharing with us what was on Smitty's heart. The events of Columbine High School deeply affected Smitty, and it shows in the songs on this album.The album is worth the purchase just for the title track and the extremely reprise at the end of the CD. Do not miss out on Smitty's sharing of his heart."
4,Great CD!,"Hearing the difference in his contemplative style has had an impact on me. Although I didn't rate this as high as LIVE THE LIFE, I did this only because I felt that album overall had more punch, which is what I want from Michael W. Smith. You need this album for the title song alone; The Columbine incident had impact on us all, and he puts our thoughts into the lyrics. The video of THIS IS YOUR TIME is possibly the most moving video I have ever seen. You will not be disappointed with this purchase!"
5,KICKIN',"For the first time Michael really lets lose with his Motorhead cover of ""Ace of Spades."" This disc rocks; like our savior. If you want to find faith without the hassle of reading words or enlisting multiple shoes, this rrrrocking CD is your cup of tea. YEEEOOOWW!"
5,Want a disc you never tire of? This is it.,"There are rare occassions when you find a disc that you could play a hundred times and still want to listen to it again. This is one of them. First the music is outstanding. From the diversity of the types of music to the remarkable melodies, you want this disc to just keep spinning. But as marvelous as the music is, it is the actual production of the disc that makes it a standout. Michael W. Smith has become one of those artists who is not satisfied with anything but near perfection in the studio and it shows. That's why he keeps getting nominations for Grammys and Dove awards. He is a master craftsman whose poetry, music and production make this title a keeper."
5,Another Winner!,MWS has been one of my favorite artists since the 80's and this CD is another winner. His songs are timeless and inspiring. The love and gratitude he has for his family and friends shows through every song and leaves you with a warm and fuzzy feeling. He usually includes a small musical piece and 'Rince De' is a refreshing change. My fave is 'Hey You It's Me' - make sure you read the lyrics to that one. 'This is Your Time' is a gentle reminder to pray for the Columbine families. In this day and age we need more artists like MWS who stand for something good and pure.
4,A SMALL STEP BACK,"IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MIRACLE TO TOP ""LIVE THE LIFE"" AND I'M SORRY TO SAY THERE IS NO MIRACLE WITH SMITH'S LATEST EFFORT,""THIS IS YOUR TIME"".WHILE THERE ARE SOME OUTSTANDING TRACKS SUCH AS ""HEY YOU IT'S ME,THE TITLE TRACK,AND THE SURPRISINGLY HARD EDGED ROCK SONG,""REACH OUT TO ME"",FOR THE MOST PART THE CD LACKS THE STRONG MELODIES AND HARMONIES THAT ARE USUALLY PART OF SMITH'S BEST WORK.THE TWO SONGS ABOUT HIS DAUGHTERS SOUND ALMOST THE SAME. ALSO,SMITH'S ATTEMPT AT TODAY'S ""HIPPER""SOUND WITH ""WORTH IT ALL""AND ""DREAM"" Just DOESN'T CUT IT.ALL IN ALL NOT A BAD CD,BUT I WAS EXPECTING MORE FROM THIS GREAT ARTIST."
2,This Is Your Time,"After ""Live the Life"", I was really excited to get a hold of Michael's new album, I thought ""Live the Life"" was awesome! Unfortunately, now that I have ""This is Your Time"", I wish I wouldn't have spent my money on it. The music styles are just not consistent with the music in the last album, and if that is what you were looking for, like I was, you are in for a big disappointment. Plus, so many of the songs are about people rather than God; when I purchase a christian cd, I want to hear lyrics about God and Jesus, not wives, daughters, etc. Don't get me wrong, a tribute on an album is touching, but more than one is monotonous. Out of 13 tracks, only 3 or 4 of them match the calibur of the songs in ""Live the Life"". Just a word to the wise - those of you looking for something similar to ""Live the Life"" with great music and moving lyrics that draw you closer to God, you won't find them in this album!"
2,O.K. NOT GREAT,"Michael W. Smith is a Christian artist and I feel this CD falls short in honoring God. It contains some good qualities, such as the upbeat ""Rince De' "" and the moving ""This is your time"", but overall it is lacking a solid message."
1,Sad Music,"I found that most songs on this CD were very sad, such as 'This is your Time' and 'She Walks with Me'. Some people may like that kind of stuff, but I personally don't"
2,Too Many Albums Too Quickly?,"Michael W. Smith is a fantastic artist and I love the majority of his work, my favorite album being ""I'll Lead You Home."" The problem I have with this album is it is basically bland. I had great expectations for the title track before it was released and it's a disappointment. The album doesn't seem to have a theme. The two songs about his daughters are pretty good--the rest. . .not so good."
1,Not one of his best,"I have almost of all Michael W Smith's CDs and this is the poorest one - just as the blurb says on Amazon about this CD - ""we see few signs of the mature and seasoned songwriting"" - it is not the real Michael W Smith. It sounds very contrived, very techno and not at all peaceful or soulful like his other CDs. Many of the songs were very jarring. There were only 3 good songs the ones that Amazon discusses. That's it. Save your money for another of his CDS - which are very good."
5,Easy,"Its was simple to install, instruction werent quite necessary but would have helped if i had gotten confused. Awesome product"
4,Aux Input Breaking,The first one i bought broke after two weeks. Had to buy a new one. Lets see how this one works... Hopefully it wont break too.
4,I like it...,"Easy to install and works fine. The sound quality isnt excllent that good when using streaming music from an android phone trought the aux cable on the original cd-player, but works fine if you dont wanna change the original cd-player."
5,Work with my 2004 E46 but not my 2002 E46,Work good with my 2004 E46 but not my 2002 E46 very easy DIY now I need a mount for the iPhone
5,Great adapter,"Fit this into a 2004 Z4. Works great, just ask them for the instructions for the Z4 version to adapt this to a Z4."
2,Could be better...,"While the samples included in the book are excellent and represent the best of nature writing, the format of the book is less than stellar. The essays are presented in large chapters one after another with no introduction and no context. The title and author of the essay is only given at the END of the essay, which is needless to say rather annoying. In addition to this, unlike other oxford books of .... this volume does not give background information about authors, their times, why they wrote, etc.... which I find to be one of the most valuable aspect of an anthology.In short, it is good, but not great. I wouldn't recommend it unless you don't care about context and only want random nature writings."
4,Flannery O'Connor: A role model for women writers,"When I first picked up The Complete Stories I thought it would just be another book, but after I read the first page, I knew Flannery O'Connor was a magnificent writer. My favorite book was A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith, but now it is the Complete Stories. It takes me back to the 1940's and I just couldn't put it down. I love writing fictional stories on my free time and Flannery O'Connor has inspired me, especially in her story ""The Crop."" I recomend this book to anyone who likes a book they can call extraordinary."
3,It's still by Flannery,"Of the 31 stories included in this short story compilation, only seven have not been included in her other three books, including five stories that were revised and included in her novels. It is easy to see why the five of the seven stories in this anthology were not included in previous books; they are indeed lesser works. But, it is worth picking up this book for one of the two previously unpublished stories: ""The Partridge Festival."" A note to those who may be squeamish about this topic: There is considerably more racist material in this book than in her other works."
5,Always Worth Reading,"The short stories of Flannery O'Connor never grow old as she addresses the timeless issues of grace and redemption at work within the human struggle. Although some readers may find her creations a bit odd, the genius inherent in her work is always evident."
4,"Dark, very dark","One does not read Flannery O' Connor for feel good endings. The characters feel incredibly real, in that their innate psychology is so easy to realte to. Whether it be the old man who lives vicariously through his granddaughter and tries to shape her to be just like him to the proud intellectual who gets outmaneuvered by a crooked Bible salesman, it's disturbing in the fact that you've felt some of the same feelings as some of the despicable people that populate her short stories.The prose is incredible, and vividly shows that South in a time of rampant racism as well as transition to a more technological age. If there was one complaint, it would probably be that almost all of her stories have a tragic ending, and becomes a little predictable after a while. I consider myself pretty jaded, but a lot of the time it was cynicism for cynicism's sake, even if the underlying message spoke something all too true."
3,Flannery O'Connor: writer and philosopher,"Flannery O'Connor is a fantastic writer but her short stories can be hard to understand if you don't know certain details about her life and philosphy. To this end, the introduction presents a biography that helps us to understand this intense woman, yet gives us no clues to help us decipher her complexe artistic sense. We are left to discover her as we can."
5,timeless and relevant,"No matter how often I read one of Ms. O'Connor's works I'm reminding that while some things in the south have changed, many others have remained the same. While written decades ago, these stories could have very well taken place in what we now call the New South. All that is needed is the token transplant from the North to add an additional dynamic.For Southern Gothic, no one can beat Flanner O'Connor and the way she weaves the human fabric into the soils of society. This collection is worth a read at least once a year."
1,Not what I expected...,"A group of seniors from our church were planning a visit to the author's childhood home. I thought it would be a great idea to purchase this book as a little prize for the trip.I read a couple of the short stories and found them to be a bit disturbing. Not at all what I expected. I do not need to have a ""happy ever after"" ending to stories but I read as an escape into anothter world. I did not enjoy visiting the world through Flannery O'Connor's eyes. Sorry."
1,Could not predict shifts in industry,"This book is written in a scholarly style, and is rather laborious reading. Additionally, it lacks predictive validity and has been unable to predict any of the momentous changes in the flat-display sector that have occurred in the last year. Dated!"
1,Backward looking,"This book gives a good overview of the Flat Panel sector; it may provide a good academic case study. However, as a manager, I was also looking for advice that I could apply now. This sector has been characterized by intense competition and turbulence, especially as regards international competition. Murtha et al. provide hackneyed insights and many of their predictions and ""insights"" are wrong. Disappointing!"
5,"""Streetwise, compelling, a true insight into the getto""",I first read this book about 15 years ago and it has charredan everlasting memory as though I lived through Rick Telander.I return to Rick's uncomfortable first walk through Bed-Styin 1974 to his eventual sense of being in this place.
4,ZUNI DOLL,"Very authentic replica doll. The ""pants"" were cheap and not fastened properly, and promptly fell off. But other than that he appears just like in the movie. Even the eyes seem to have an eerie glow. I should mention that I enjoy playing with him, and not just treating ""Zuni"" as a collectible. As a result, the spear broke off, as it was just glued to his hand. But I am careful not to let the chain fall off, else he may come to life...COME TO LIFE!!!"
2,It looked nice but it broke too soon,It looks nice and the color of the phone looks better but it scrachted and broke easily. The shipping was fast and the price was right.
1,DON'T BUY,"I bought this item to protect my new Motorola L6.First of all, it's a cheap piece of plastic... would break if dropped.Second, and more important, MY PHONE DOESN'T WORK WITH IT ON! The plastic tabs on the side are were the side buttons are on the phone, preventing any usage of the entire phone.BEWARE... DON'T BUY!"
1,Quite disappointing!,The plastic is too thin. Too fragile and not sturdy. Left the phone in the bag and the case was cracked without being crushed or thrown around.
4,decent case,it does a good job of protecting my phone and it fits nicely. the only problem was that it didn't come with a belt clip.
2,Lying Seller,"I tried to cancel the order, but they said it has been shipped. I was cancelling on October 13, 2006, but the package labeled that it was shipped on October 17, 2006. How can it be shipped 4 days after it was shipped?"
5,Motorola L6 clear case,"Very happy of my purchase, perfec fit for the L6, easy access to all the function with the case on. The case gets all the scratchs and the phone stays new. The only con is that it get dusty under if you carry you phone in your pocket like I do. Solution: dust it off with compressed-gas duster once in a while."
1,The Southern Belles Handbook,"I didnt like this book! I wouldnt recommend it, if you are looking for an authentic guide to the southern women,then dont buy this! I would give it away but I dont want people confusing nonsence fictional ideas of the way us southern women are with truth! A better buy would be Grits!! A girl raised in the south guide to life!! Save your money on this one! Its a fake bunch of nonsence!"
1,A con!,"If it were possible, I wouldn't have awarded this book any stars at all, as I feel that it's just a con, relatively few (about 70) pages strung together in a tiny book of about 5"" x6"", with just a single phrase on each page. I ordered this from Amazon, using part of a gift certificate which had been given to me by my daughter and paid over US $10.00 for it. Perhaps I should have read the description of it and the dimensions of the book more carefully but, as I thoroughly enjoyed reading Marilyn Schwartz' A Southern Belle's Primer, I thought that this would be in the same vein. What a disappointment to wait for the shipment to arrive in Australia and have to wish that I'd been more astute and ordered something else!"
3,"Cute ""Little"" Book","This is a cute book for a teenager.I thought it would be more of a ""guide"" but all in all for the price I'm not disappointed."
1,Waste of money.,"Ridiculous, teeny little book with one sentence per page. Don't waste your money. Better to get Ronda Rich's ""What Southern Women Know."""
2,Not what I thought,"This book is cute. It is more of a coffee table book for a young girl's room. I did not realize that it just listed off quotes to ""live by"". It is formatted with like a ""rule"" on each page."
5,I don't love the book,"shipping and product condition were timely and accurately described that being said - I bought the book on a recomendation from a friend buth the book is a waste of time to read, don't bother."
4,A guilty pleasure,I really enjoyed reading this little book. I found it so cute and like the humorous nuggets of information. Sissy LeBlanc is a true Southern Belle.
4,Good book for beginners,"This is a pretty good book for the beginning computer user. Much of the information can be found without too much difficulty out on the net, so if you feel like saving a few bucks go there. If you don't feel like messing with searching around buy the book"
5,Totally Sinister Brutal Death,"This is the first Sinister album and like Diabolical Summoning, it's also a classic and just as devestating. Prepare yourself for a ride through Hell and even though Hell is a really bad place, this album will make it enjoyable only you're a fan of totally brutal death metal. Some of my favorites here are Parennial Mourning, Doomed, Cross The Styx, Corridors To The Abyss and Putrifying Remians. That track will leave in limbo. If you're into Nile, Malevolent Creation, Cannibal Corpse, Deicide and Morbid Angel, get this and take the ride. You'll enjoy it."
5,Outstanding and Detailed Work on Mystic Phenomena!,"Brilliant book! I absolutely loved the in-depth and scholarly review of the gifts given to various saints. This book had numerous interesting stories about the lives of saints and the gifts of bi-location, stigmata, miraculous healings, levitation, etc. I've been very interested in this type of mystical phenomena for years and no book has come close to explaining not only to whom these occur but also takes on the religious view of why they occur. The author has clearly spent a great deal of time researching and compiling this work. Dr. Johnson is fast becoming one of my favorite authors in Catholic non-fiction literature. I encourage readers to also check out his fascinating book ""Rosary: Mysteries, Meditations, and the Telling of the Beads""."
5,Teach enterpreneurship to your kid,"I read this (in hardcover) as an 11-year-old in the seemingly-forbidden halls of the local secondary school's library. This is THE book to charge a kid's minds with visions of entrepreneurship.There's an eyebrow-raising where-is-this-coming-from bomb plot diversion, which disappears as soon as it arrives. This, I think, is the book's only low point. It could easily have been cut out of the book, and nobody would have noticed.Excellent book. This book always comes to mind whenever I have to remember how many dozens are in a gross."
1,Lesson time,"My child was assigned this book which i guess was the best way to sell it in 2010. With all the choices in children's fiction available, why oh why in 2010 would anyone make them read this kind of free-market propaganda? Well, it hits the mark on the 'good-for-you' category: complete with math problems and pithy expressions of 'color-blind' and masculine-feminine friendships... subtle.Not a whole lot of summer pleasure here. I kinda wish Black Beauty would gallop in with a copy of Treasure Island ...."
4,Cute sweater -- awkward fit,"I so love this sweater, it's adorable! I just wish it fit my dog. She's a 10lb Pomeranian so I bought her the small (someone bought a medium for a 20lb dog so I think that would be too big). The length is good, but the leg holes are weird. My dog walks bow-legged in it and can only lift her paw halfway to her face to try to scratch her face. The neck is pretty high too. The thickness of the sweater is great though for cold weather. I'm trying to stretch it out a bit, but I don't know if it will help. Crossing my fingers!"
3,Product was fine but packaged very poorly.,"The cookie cutter is okay now but when it arrived it was completely flattened and I had to reshape it. It was sent in an envelope with very little padding. Being a cookie cutter junkie I have ordered lots of cutters online and they always arrive intact, in boxes..."
4,Just a very good one.,I must admit...i did not know this band. I've heard this for the first time in the recordstore from a friend of mine. I've bought it then....and never had any regrets buying it.
3,A really long EP with different versions of prior songs and covers,"This is a long EP but here is an offering by the band between ""The Grand Leveller"" and ""Transcend the Rubicon"". The band at this point still seems to be struggling with album production (this one happens to be mega treble heavy with little mid-range) but the production here is better than the first album. The slow song ""Dark is the Season"" is long but has many parts to it and doesn't get boring. Both ""Jumping at the Shadows"" and ""Experimental Stage"" are different recordings of songs from prior albums (The Grand Leveller and Subconscious Terror). The cover songs are good too.Even though several of the reviews below have listed the vocalist as Barney Greenway, Dave Ingram is the vocalist here and on every Benediction release except ""Subconscious Terror"" and the newest ""Organised Chaos"".Recommended album if you have the money to throw down on this and have all the other worthy full length Benediction albums of this era."
4,Barracuda & Challenger,This is a very informative book. It's filled with beautiful full color photographs and lays out the history of these two cars. I enjoyed it.
2,"Great idea, poor construction","My three year old and my 16 month old both love Bear and were excited to get this book! The pieces however are way too flimsy and too difficult to place into the slots in the book. If the book had been constructed a little differently, it would have been far more enjoyable."
3,A Little Tedious,"I bought this album after hearing some samples and I thought it would be great, but I was a little disappointed. I am a big fan of Joe Henderson. I guess I respect Charlie Haden, but sometimes his pacing can be slow. I have seen Joe Henderson perform live (playing Ellington and Strayhorn tunes) in a trio with George Mraz and Al Foster and it was a lot livelier. It may be that Joe is mellowing out in deference to Charlie. Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed Charlie's Quartet West featuring Ernie Watts over the years. They were great in person when I saw them. It may be that this combination of songs did not bring out the best from the group."
1,Christopher Cross should be ashamed,"I'm a closet Christopher Cross fan -- and was eagerly awaiting the delivery of this CD. I couldn't have been more disappointed. While the instrumentals are there, Cross's voice is long gone and he is so off key on many of the songs that it is shameful. My wife made the comment many songs sound as if they are being peformed in a Karaoke bar. We laughed aloud at many of the songs.... Do yourself a favor and buy the studio versions intead."
3,"Four stars for the song selection, but Cross has sounded better.","I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that on this CD, Christopher Cross seems to have noticeable trouble staying on key. I like the song selection, though, which includes most of Cross's best known hits. I also like the sound production and the band, which to my ears are pretty good. Michael McDonald is a guest star for ""Ride Like The Wind"" and ""All Right"" and unfortunately, he really shows up Christopher Cross when he sings backup.I think this disc is worthwhile for casual Christopher Cross fans, but be aware that these live versions reveal a lot more than studio versions. Cross doesn't sound perfect on these cuts."
5,You'll like it,This book is displayed at the Smithsonian Museum in Washington D.C. It is a good book to teach the ABC's with ELLs.
1,Not what I expected,"I've been looking for a book one of my teachers used when I was little to teach me to draw pictures using letters. This was NOT it. I own a couple of his other books, and they are great. What's up with this one? IDK! Don't waste your money on this one!"
4,"A little sadness, now...","now, although I love this series to death, (the dark, noir-esque, dirty background and the intrigue are compelling) I must let some people in on a little secret...the series was never finished...thirteen is the last one ever produced...yes, yes...I, too, was heartbroken when I read this...why cartoon network decided to air an incomplete show, I will never know...but now you know...well, later..."
3,minus two for half the series,"Batman fans will feel right at home watching the Big O. Offered overseas in subtitles, this dvd comes with the first 13 episodes, but because America can't apoligize to certain nations, the consumer can only get 4 episodes on Volume 1. The added feature to DVD is to have more on one disc and at better quality. It's like buying a 8 hour vhs tape and only recording a thirty second commercial. So why are we paying more? My suggestion is if you really want to get all the episodes with the least amount of dvd's, AND you want to save money, go to any online auction and get the entire series on one dvd for the same price for the four here. Only difference, is english overdub. This disc has it, the overseas don't, but it has english subtitles. Another suggestion, learn to read faster."
2,Running from the Room,I thought this anime as terrible. Everytime I hear the theme song I go running from the room. I didn't like that it was so much like Batman. And I didn't like the giant robot at all. The only thing I liked about this series was I thought the andriod girl was funny.
2,a Good anime,the anime itself is excellent. Big O will always be one of my favorites but my one complaint with this is the packaging when i bought it i assumed with the name The Big O: Anime Legends Complete Collection that it would well be...the complete collection all the episodes just not the first season. If it had been named The Big O: Anime Legends Complete Collection vol 1 then i could have assumed there would be a second vol but with out that i just assumed that it would be the entire series and ended up buying vol 2 a week later after sadly realizing i was wrong
4,"Well, isn't that odd.....","I was going through an odd period where I wanted to see a tasteful reversion to the ""Golden Age"" of science fiction. Then, as if I had some say in ther matter, along comes The Big O.Noirish and sad, the characters plod their way through Paradigm City. Memories, like the contents of the box in ""Kiss Me Deadly,"" draw people toward them and their doom.Although The Big O draws imagery and mood from so many established sources (ie. Batman, Tetsujin 28 etc...) it can be construed as a alternate universe story line for any of them. I believe, however, that the show stands on its own.Besides, as Roger Smith will attest, we all stand on the sholders of giants."
4,A decent beginning for an excellent series.,"Big O is just one of those series that has both anime purists and casual fans split down the middle. Those against it attack its similarity to the Batman cartoon, as well as the cliche'd human-android relationship. Those for it cite the impeccable style and depth of the plotline, which may escape those who see only one or two episodes.Although I myself am a big fan of Big O, I thought that the first four episodes did well to start off the series, but it could have been better. I advise those that buy this dvd to no hesitate and buy the other Big O dvd's when they are released, as this series is nothing unless you view all of the episodes.This rating is of This particular dvd, and not the series as a whole. Mind you, the last few episodes are what make the whole series a classic, at least from this person's point of view.Music: 5 stars Animation quality: 4 stars Story: 4 stars Extras: 4 stars"
4,Rhyme Bomb! Explodes With Awesome Power!,"Rhyme Bomb! Had me rockin'from the Intro. An outstanding CD, Rhyme Bomb! continues the journey that King B.A.V. started on Violence Is Golden. No Prints On the Gun is a fitting continuation of All's Well In Hell. You can feel the power of the bass and the orchestra behind No More Mr. Nice Guy. That track kicks ...! The ballads make it clear that King B.A.V. knows how to talk to the ladies. Who The .... We Be? is an outstanding track that features Raw-B trading verses with the King. Just listening to the CD makes you feel like you are a part of each track. Other favorities include A Night With The King and Freestyle With The B.A.V. Dub. The bass kicks in and takes you on a journey of the night life with King B.A.V."
4,Yucky gooey fun!,"I am children's/young adult librarian and always on the lookout for program ideas. Love these books, so I bought them for my own personal collection as well as library's."
4,"Nice story, especially for curious couple!","I enjoy this author, however I do wish she would extend the length of her writings!! I like the way this couple communicates...especially in the end!!"
5,Great ideas,Lots of good ideas to try--my copy has many yellow highlights. So far the best D/s book I've read this year.
2,80's Jackyl???,"The first and last tracks are classic hard driving Jackyl songs, everything in between suffers from the lifelessness of studio recording. The exceptions being Down this Road Before which is utterly inexcusable for a band that once swore, ""no ballads"" and Sparks from Candy which I'm sure is phenomenal when performed live.As a side note, is it just me or does Jackyl continue to sound more and more 80's as we drift away from that decade? And no, I'm not one of those people that would consider that a good thing. Kill the Sunshine, reminds me a lot of Def Leppord (without the empathetic wheezing vocals) or a similar band.If your new to Jackyl I'd recommend their first two albums. A live Jackyl show, on the other hand, is not to be missed by anyone."
3,"Ehhhh,,,,, self titles was better!","I bought this because ""AC/DC's Brian Johnson"" co wrote ""Kill The Sunshine"" with the group! but with the lacking members and everythign else, this album failed to be as great as the previous ones! I recomend there self titles album over this one!"
2,"No Rock, No Roll, No Jackyl......",One listen was enough for me ... 40% of the original band is missing. The songs have no melody; and without the twin lead guitar attack this is Jackyl in name only. Notice how many used one's there are for sale? 'Nuff said.
2,"Alright, not the best money ever spent","We got pregnant in Ireland, so wanted an Irish name. This book had a few, mostly older names that I can't pronounce. Wasn't too impressed. Celtic Names for Children was a better buy and included most of the same names."
3,Very Irish Names,"If you are looking for a Traditional Irish name this is a great book, but by traditional I mean one no one will be able to pronounce or spell correctly. There are old Irish names, with a few common ones mixed in, 90% of this book I found useless."
2,Kind of Disappointed,This book was alright. It didn't have as many names as I had anticipated. I have other Irish Name books that put this one to shame. Collin Gems is the best book by far!
1,Not worth the return postage...,"I ordered this book and was going to return it because it is such poor quality but it wasn't worth the return postage. I put it in the recycling bin instead. Seriously! I was surprised to see so many good reviews that I felt it was my duty to report otherwise. Try doing a web search if you are looking for Irish baby names rather than wasting the money on this book. You can see by my signature that we went a different route entirely (this was not caused by the terrible quality of the book, however! We decided our surname was good enough)."
1,O'Joke,"My husband's from Ireland, so we got this book thinking it would help to make our baby name decision easier. Half the names are made up, or last names used as first names (which no one does in Ireland). A lot of the pronunciations were wrong, as well as a lot of the meanings of the names. I haven't tried any of the other Irish baby name books out there, but if you're looking for an Irish name, I'd just use Google and check out a couple websites."
1,Died after 5 months,"Good quality for a while, but died after 5 months with HO2 errors. Stay away from this one."
1,Read the reviews for people who have had it a while...,"I am shocked by the number of reviews with my same story. I had the unit just long enough to be out of warranty when it shut down. Mine will not even read DVDs, much less other media.As good as Panansonic appears for the money, I will find it hard to buy another."
