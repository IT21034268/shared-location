5,Lost,Having all the episodes of Lost enables the family to go back and watch previous show which help explain some of the present events. With Season 6 completing now it will be a worthwhile addition to our film library.
5,What's happen next?,Thanks god season 6 is beggining right now!! I have a lot of question and this never finish answer me... It's incredible all the features that BluRay gives... It has a lot of new releases in entertaiment... I would never be so proud of my purchase...
1,Complete Garbage,The final season was a waste. After the finale you'll be scratching your headed wondering why you wasted so many hours of your life with this series.
1,Why change the box now???,"I collect LOST box sets since day one, loved the way they looked, it was the most fancy good-looking boxes in my 400+ dvd collection. Why change it now? Two seasons to the end? Was it REALLY necessary? BE AWARE, this box set does not have that vivid plastic box glove that made this series to be the most beautiful on the shelf. It comes in that cheap low-quality small-cost old-looking cardboard box."
5,Best Season Yet!,"Every Season of Lost has been impressive but the last two seasons 4 & 5 have been totally amazing. They are so watchable - you can't stop till you've seen every episode - then when you finish, after the surprise ending - you'll want to go back and rewatch the entire season again.I had already seen this season twice on DVR, finished the third time on Blu-Ray, and am watching it again- that goes to show just how brilliant and captivating this show is.There were many big risks in season 5 but all of them payed off beautifully and fans of the show will literally be blown away by season 5 - I've seen all five amazing seasons but this is the best yet!"
5,Lost Season 5 Best Yet!,"I have been a loyal LOST fan since the beginning, and I must say I think Season 5 will go down as the best season as a whole of all the seasons put together. True, there are still more seasons too go, but I really can't see how the writers & producers could do much better. I hope I am wrong, but I think Lost has hit its peak with Season 5. If you stopped watching lost for any reason this season, pre-order the DVD set for the December 2009 holiday season, and get lost again. This season (Non-Specific Basic Overall Plot Spoiler Now!!!) is very well focused and fine tuned on just a few familiar classic characters with an general emphasis on time-travel so you won't have a problem getting back into the action. Then again, you might get intellectually lost with some profound thought experiences following the drama. What a great show! That is all I will say about season 5. Go get lost again, and pre-order Lost Season 5 for a great price on amazon.com. I will..."
5,lost,This was purchase for another individual. It was just what he wanted. He was really impressed by how fast it arrived at his housel
4,"Fantastic Show, Inconsistent Box Set!","LOST is my favorite show of all time, thus I have no complaints whatsoever about the show itself, as it is fantastic. I do however have a complaint about the Box Set design. For 4 straight seasons they have designed the season box sets in a consistent fashion, until now, with a sleek loving plastic casing that slid out the bottom. This box set is in a cardboard casing that slides out from the side, and has thrown of the entire look of my lost collection. In addition to this, there is usually an abundance of bonus features, whereas this season the bonus features are far more limited! Overall, I was disappointed with the look of the Season 5 Box Set, and I can only hope that for the final season they rectify it!"
5,great show!,"This is one of the best shows I have seen on TV in some time. It is refreshing to watch a series that is not based on doctors, lawyers, forensics or cops with same old ideas and stories - just different characters. This will give you different adventures show after show. Even if some of the ideas is way out there - it kicks back with something amazing and intense.If you are going to watch Season 5, you will have to watch the other 4 seasons beforehand. Or you too will be LOST!! This is an ongoing and continuous story. There will only be 6 seasons to this show and the final one is coming on ABC Feb 2nd so you will not have to wait too long to finish out the entire series. It is well worth it!!"
4,Very good for a used product.,"The disc has frozen up a couple times, but otherwise a great value for the money."
4,"I was completely ""lost"".","Lost - The Complete Fifth Season was the weirdest season yet. The first five episodes I was confused beyond belief, the flashforwards, flashbacks, and the present time is all jumbled together - I almost stopped watching this show altogether. Towards the middle, I kinda understood where the writers were heading, the season finale was definitely intriguing. Josh Holloway and Terry O'Quinn are still my favorite actors. Watch this show with someone who knows all the backstories because that helped me figure out what the hell was going on! Good show, can't wait for the final season next January."
3,HUH... I'm lost,"I fully admit good tv is good tv, but it's just to unrealistic to have people who fought so hard to make it off an island to go back to that island under their own free will..once you get past that though Lost always delivers."
3,What a mess!,"This last season is full of short interleaving episodes from the future and the past with jumping through the time without any contribution to the plot, other than to allow resurrection of some long dead characters, it all becomes chaotic, aimless and erratic. The main characters are quite pushed to the sidelines, other secondary characters are magnified for no apparent purpose, and, though the plot contains some brilliant sparkles, the general impression of watching the episodes is of being drawn into a vortex with ever increasing speed and clueless about the future... And after it all, I am doubtful that all ""mysteries"" will be resolved by the end of this (last, I think) season."
3,wats with the packaging!,"less episodes, more expensive, way cheaper packaging. any real fan of this show has them tivo's or downloaded and burned. i am boycotting buying this until the studio realizes they ruined the box set."
2,FRUSTRATING,I only bought this to complete the collection and check out the extras. The season was a disappointment and very frustrating.
5,Best Show on Television,"I own all the seasons and will buy this one as soon as it comes out. This is my favorite show. Brilliant writing, acting , and storyline. Everything is starting to come together perfectly and the waiting was totally worth it. LOVE LOVE LOVE this show!!! I wish it wasn't ending next season."
4,waiting,"Haven't got to it yet, but I'm sure it will be as good as the other seasons. I am watching it season by season, so I don't miss anything."
3,"Still good, but hard to follow","If you read my review of Season 2, you know I went gaga over this series. Everyone warned me that the first 2 or 3 seasons were great. Then the writers/actors had gone on strike and the writing suffered. Now, I tend to agree. Without giving anything away, the show got a little out there with time travel entering into the mix. It made an interesting show confusing with some time travel flashes taking place a minute apart. There were also less episodes in the later seasons, again, I believe due to the stike. It is still a good show and I am anxious to see how everything ties together, but the first few seasons were much better."
4,Lost 5 review,"The product was in alright shape, it was missing the plastic sleeve I was hoping to get with it however. Was ordered as a Christmas present and it came just in time."
5,Lost Rocks!,"I've ordered this season and I got it sooner than I expected...within 3 days, I was very happy. Package arrived in great condition and was very easy to unpacked, I am very satisfied by the service and thanks to all the people that collaborated with me in order for me to received this package safely. 2 thumbs up to all."
4,"Great Show, Wish There Were A Few More Extras","I have bought all the seasons of LOST on DVD so I wanted to buy this for my collection. The show is the best on television--for me, it is the best drama of all time. I do wish there were more extras. Other seasons seemed to have more fulfilling extras and this one seemed more hastily done. I always like the deleted scenes and the bloopers, but for some reason the extras all seemed too short. Maybe I just love the show so much that I always want more, but in prior seasons it seems like it took longer to get through all the extras and this time I got through them all rather quickly."
5,BEST SEASON SO FAR,"Now bias as I am since I have been a LOST fan since season 1 this season 5 was AMAZING. ESP. with all the Sci-fi and I never really thought I was a Sci-fi girl but I loved this season, it answered so so so many questions and of course gave us many more but it totally set us up for season 6 and although Ill be very sad to see this show finish its been an AMAZING RIDE and never been dull, these writers are beyond brilliant!"
4,A little bit confused,"I liked it and am addicted to the series. However, this season was not quite as good. I would give it 3 1/2 stars. You sure can't fall asleep watching it."
5,great show,This is such a great show and season 5 is no exception. It's an edge of your seat series that I recommend to anyone.
3,Started out pretty good...,I just got into Lost a few months ago and it started out pretty good. Now I'm on the last season of Lost and I can tell you as the seasons climb my interest falls. It's like the writers ran out of things to write about...
3,No Way Out,"It seems that Lost is getting lost. It's good for rising your hopes, but it seems the answers are poorly shown, if it is considered that a story wants to be told. It could be better."
2,dvd collection looks ruined with this packaging,"I give 2 stars only because it's ""Lost"" but here we should talk about the poduct. I agree with the others rewiews about the change of packaging, it looks really weird next to the old seasons and since I'm from europe, the only reason I buy theese dvds in the usa is for the great packaging you used to get and I have to say that this box set is really similar to the ugly ones we get here. Let's send BVHE as much complaint emails as possible!"
3,ABC gives the finger to collectors,"Content is A-ok. You're a ""Lost"" fan or you're not - so content is good, or not.But why, why, why, after four seasons of consistent packaging do we all of a sudden get something entirely different? No hard plastic sleeve, and the box itself is of a different construction as well. Hello ABC? Maybe I like it when a TV-series on my bookshelve looks like a *series*?"
5,Great purchase,I bought this as a gift for my brother and he likes it a lot. The shipping was fast and product was in the stated condition. Would do business again.
2,Glitches in DVDs?,"For a person who loves Lost, having the new DVD cause read problems is very disappointing. For Xmas this year I bought myself a new BlueRay player and recieved the Lost-5 pack as a gift. The BlueRay works with other disks but my Lost set, well, often gets lost. This reminds me of shipping damaged MS-Halo games. Anyone else experiencing tracking issues? PS: I love Lost."
5,Lost without Lost,I am totally hooked on this series!! Appreciate the quick ship and decent price via Amazon!!!
5,Lost,Arrived in great condition and on time. Bought for kids as I became addicted to series. This series is MUCH better to watch seasons closely together as you get more out of each viewing and you remember so much more of what has happened.
3,faulty blu-ray discs,I enjoyed the show but the blu-ray discs were faulty. Every-so-often the dialog became muffled so that you couldn't understand what was being said. The only correction that worked was to turn it off and start over again and use the fast forward to get back to where you left off. Of course you had to sometimes guess where to stop the fast forwarding.
2,broken box,The case for my DVD's has something wrong with it so 3 of my DVD's don't stay 'locked' in place. They slide out of their spaces and fall out of the box. Even though it's annoying I figured it would be more of a pain to return it (I didn't watch it until I had already thrown out the packaging) so I just deal with it and am hoping they don't get scratched!!
2,Mom4,I knew these were used but they have blockbuster stickers all over them an are held together by a rubber band. They were listed in good condition.
3,Can you spell STRETCH ?,"Overall the 6 seasons of LOST were a good series that I enjoyed. On the other hand, this season, more than any other seemed like the writers were just filling time to stretch it out for one more year."
3,Cheated,"I love how Lost fans have been cheated out of quite a few bonus features for season 5, only because we don't have the latest and greatest blu-ray equipment. Year after year, we have purchased these expensive DVDs, and our loyalty is rewarded with a slight. Not to mention the dwindling number of episodes. But that is another story. I love the series, but this was a low-blow. Hopefully next year, they will learn to respect ALL the fans that made them the success they are today."
5,Perfect Acting Without a doubt,The first time I saw Carmen Jones I could not believe what I was seeing. I was seeing a beautiful black woman play her heart out on screen. This film is remarkable and I recommend it to anyone who loves classics. I wish she were still alive so I could tell her how much I love her.
5,carmen jones is absolutely fabulous.,"this classic movie/musical shows the talents of some african american stars who opened many doors for black people. harry belafonte is great in portraying joe whose captured by the sauciness of carmen a role embodied by the late dorothy dandridge. wonderful singing and dancing even actually showed the dancer alvin ailey... great for american-black culture in music, dance and passion."
5,"Like I always sayafter l watch a movie,not like carmen Jones",Carmen Jones made me flew a thousand miles and made me walk thru all movie shops forgetting the tittle and always wondering how l can see that movie again.It 's been 15years since l saw it and l never forgotten Dorothy's outstanding Habenera musical show and her stlye.I think there would never be a movie like Carmen Jones
1,"The reason for not liking it was, we could not play it because the format was not for Australia.","We have tried it in our motor home, on our computer and in our hi fi system and cannot play ever"
5,The Best!!,After seeing the first scene with Dorothy in the cafeteria I haven't been able to get her out of my mind. An absolutely incredible job by Dorothy!
4,Highly amusing what if take on the original,"A very interesting ""what if"" take on the continuation of the Phantom story. Ms Pettengill's use of words are masterfully written and evoke colorful images that stoke the imagination to take off, as if the reader were actually standing right there witnessing every act.I found this to be a very good companion to Leroux's original, she even back tracks a little to cover some things mentioned in the original. The only drawback I found was some scenes lingered on and on or were referenced back to a little too much (i.e. the whole voodoo aspect) but then the whole book is told through Erik's voice which is a nice aspect."
4,Well Done!,"I was very pleased with the author's ability to keep true to the characters (ok, good point about the phrase ""warm and tingly"" seeming out of place for the Phantom to say, however it did not seem out of place to me when I read this novel).Beautiful plot development; relationships are delicately developed throughout the novel."
5,Fabulous!,"I thought this book was wonderful!I always wondered what the story would sound like from Erik's point of view. It's amazing hearing what he was doing while he wasn't with Cristine. I have also wondered what would happen if Erik was not ""dead"". I would read this book even if I hadn't read the original."
3,Not a bad edition to the saga,"Even without Li Lian-Jie, this movie still flows. Chiu Man Cheuk does a descent job of stepping up and playing the lead character. If Jet didn't do such a superb job in the previous titles, you wouldn't have noticed the change.The story, in my opinion, is just a rehash of part 3. It's a similar plot, without the romance subplot between Wong Fei-Hung and Peony.But the jewel in this movie is the character development of Club Foot (aka Seven). Max Mok is a refreshing sight in this flick.Definitely better than Once Upon a Time in China and America, but too similar to part 3.Worth a rent, maybe a purchase."
5,Fantastic!,"First off you have to look at this as not another Jet Li movie. The wire work is excellent, the skill is fantastic and the story line is great. This is Action packed. And you will not be disapointed. Its that good trust me. The writer who said its not worth watching has no clue about Gung Fu, this Star is a Star in his own right. And the movie wasn't not just put together. They took their time to show a very true boxer rebellion in China. Get this if there are any left. The is a discontinued DVD But there are a few left out there this is a Gung Fu Classic for sure!"
4,Chiu Man Cheuk Continues the Saga in Full Force,"Chiu Man Cheuk's (also known as Wing Zhao) debut as the sucessor of Jet Li in the role of Wong Fei Hung in the Once Upon a Time in China series. This is a brilliant piece of work, the introduction is magnificent, with a clear mix of Taji and Tong Bei Quan. Chiu Man Cheuk's style is fast, fierce, diverse, and orginal, as evidenced by the astounding scene in the prison. The only reason why this movie is not perfect, is the fact that the story is not as interesting and compelling, but the fight scenes make up for that fact. A must see for any avid Martial Artist. Recommended viewing: Mahjong Drajon and Blade, two of Chiu Man Cheuk's best, fun to watch with your whole family. Note: Keep your finger on the slow motion button, before you miss all the action. :)"
3,Meet the new kid,"This film sees a new Wong Fei Hung and is akin to having a new actor playing James Bond. Jet Li made the part his own so any actor would feel the pressure of stepping into those kung fu slippers. In fact the whole film seems to be aimed at introducing us to Chiu Man Chuk, the new Wong. Elements of the first three films are blended into the story, which is the weakest part of the film but the fight scenes are great. One for fans I think. Best character has to be the horse punching Billy Chow."
1,Not worth the money,"I found it sadly disappointing to even watch this DVD. Even if I hadn't watch the previous 3 before watching this, everything seemed unnatural and odd, even more so after watching the first 3 movies before this one. This didn't have Jet Li in it, and even though most of the original characters from the prior 3 are in here, they acted different and it can be seen."
1,not so hot,He sounds like he's got a chip on his shoulder about women. The writer seems to be arrogant. I wish him well on his search. He'll need it.
4,Great Product,"My daughter 7 years old, have a beautiful curly hair, but is so hard to brush in the morning.With this cream, is easy, looks like soft perm.But I recommend do not use daily."
3,A Comprehensive Tool for Stevens Scholarship,"Although prohibitively priced, ""Critical Essays on Wallace Stevens"" provides an accessible starting point for Stevens scholarship for pleasure of for academic purposes. With essays by noted Stevens scholars, Harold Bloom and Northrop Frye in addition to many others, this collection of essays provides a useful survey of the range of views taken by contemporary scholars and usefully illuminates both Stevens' shorter and longer poems."
5,Still fascinating after all these years.,"I had heard about the Hill's experience many, many years ago and I often wondered if it was really true what happened to them. My own personal opinion now, after reading this book, is that it did indeed happen.I could not turn the pages fast enough. There is no way that two people could have such intricate details of an event like that and be making it up. Surely someone along the way would have seen through them. I lived in the White Mountains for a few years and being familiar with the area of occurrence made the book an even better read. The Hill's are intelligent and educated, their story is one of a kind. If you don't believe now, you will after you read this book. If the tops of your shoes get scuffed and you don't know how they got that way, you'd better check your watch !"
3,Innocent Truth,"One of the classic UFO stories - Lacks substantial critical investigation, so well done in later UFO books - Dated and repetitive - Convincing despite its innocence - A must for all ufoligists"
5,Worth the read.,"I don't get all the way through many books, but I finished this one.It actually got better towards the end, with some really original thinking."
3,It's an OK movie,"This movie can relate to the different tastes of people. For example one person might hate it, but then another person might love it. Movie about Larry Flint's (founder of Hustler magazine) life where he gets in and out of trouble. This movie shows that you can do something if you struggle and don't give up. Rated R: for graphic language, nudity and sexuality."
3,To agree or not to agree,"While Mr. Moore presents his view with reasonable facts of science, it leaves one with the impression ""what do we do now?"" I never got a clear picture of his definition of the Nature vs. Nurture debate."
4,Mike Swain's Basic Judo & Basic Grappling,This set lays a beginners foundation to this sport and no one is better than Swain teaching this sport. The dvd format allows you to more easily review the grappling moves.
1,Dont Waste Your Time,I cant believe I sat through the whole 45 minutes. I kept waiting for it to get better. I wish someone had posted a review before I bought this highlight tape of plays from the 60's and then later year oops from the Arena league. Dont waste your cash or your time. Note: I give this video 1 Star under diress not worth that.
4,Happy Days,An older (1994?) Gaither DVD with an emphasis on old style Convention singing. A little too much talk with the interviewer but the songs are just what you would expect from the Gaither stable. If you enjoy singing along with the old Convention songs you will find this a great video.
2,Disappointed in lack of source code,"I'm relatively new to eclipse and I really like the idea of slim books - I like distilled cut-to-the chase books. Dr. Carlson's book is concise, clear, succinct and packed with useful information for the Java developer. But, there is one gigantic omission... The source code he uses and references in the example that runs through out the book is missing. I've looked to no avail. I hope that the author corrects this with a posting of the source on the web."
5,Increase your proficiency with Eclipse today,"While there are many books available for developers wishing to build Eclipse plug-ins, there are few that provide pragmatic coverage of how best to use Eclipse for building regular Java applications.In Eclipse Distilled, David Carlson does a superb job of introducing how to best use Eclipse 3.0. David takes the time to share many of the tips and techniques that will allow the reader to embrace an agile software development process.One of the qualities of this book is that it is only 290 pages. The discussion is ""to the point"" and always relevant. Most readers should expect to be able to read this book and increase their proficiency with Eclipse in just a few weeks.Having read the book in its entirety I highly recommend Eclipse Distilled. While it will mostly be of interest to developers new to Eclipse, there are plenty of gems here that even seasoned Eclipse developers might have missed."
3,The book is now dated.,"I bought this book quite a while ago (probably around the 2005 time frame). I now have a job developing in Java using the Eclipse IDE. I just finished reading chapter 10. This chapter presents JUnit testing from the perspective of JUnit3. JUnit4 is now the latest and greatest framework, and it is substantially different. There are some aspects of IDE that carry over; but, even here, there are changes (as to be expected).This book needs a serious update. The idea of a distilled Eclipse manual is still relevant."
1,waste of money,topics are discussed too abstractly - can't find source code. book skips too many steps to be useful. might be good for experienced developers. not useful to me. wasted money.
3,Ok for beginers...No help for experienced users,I read this book end to end but didnt find even a single startling fact about eclipse that i didnt know already.It was more like feature round up ( which you can discover going through the menu items in eclipse IDE)I would recommend this book for people who are absolutly new to eclipse .
2,not worth 29.99...,"grand master zhang is an amazing martial artist but this video is terrible. it teaches 10 spring leg only and cuts off offense after 3. there is not 50 minutes worth of learing techniques on this mayhaps about...25-30 mintues. it was very cheaply done, it didnt do her any justice. i would not recommend this to anyone...unless it was under $5."
4,"""Buzzcocks addict""","First heard Buzzcocks in London many yrs ago, and have been into their sound ever since. Their image, for me, is totally attached to punk movement -- as it's main symbol. All songs sound so ""instinctive"" and classic at the same time that when you first hear them it feels as if you had already been done it many times before."
4,"""Buzzcocks addict""","First heard Buzzcocks in London many yrs ago, and have been into their sound ever since. Their image, for me, is totally attached to punk movement -- as it's main symbol. All songs sound so ""instinctive"" and classic at the same time than when you first hear them it feels as if you had already been done it many times before."
4,classic songs,"BUZZCOCKS stuff never gets boring...not much more than pop music at times,but done so well and very very catch tunes indeed.""what do i get,i dont mind and love you more"" get you in the mood...""everybodys happy nowadays and harmony in my head"" just finish the job...brilliant"
5,This is one of the best records ever made! Buy it!!,"Anyone who thinks all punk is cacophonous garbage, or who thinks pop music is sugarcoated crap should listen to this record - arguably the best hybrid of the two ever put on record.Naturally, nobody ever bought it.Strangely enough, though, fifteen years later in 1994 a band called Green Day recorded something that sounded awfully similar (not as good, but similar) and are farting through silk.No one ever said originality was profitable.P.S. ""Operator's Manual"" contains this entire record plus a lot of other good stuff."
5,buzzcocks rule the late 70S in the new wave scene,the buzzcocks created a variety of albums if you do not like one try another. this music is not to fall asleep on. all there music is upbeat. try howard devoto and noko:luxuria:the bands name :unanswerable lust or beast box :cd/album
2,"Badly remastered, poor quality audio","This CD has extremely poor audio quality, this is the worst remastered CD I ever bought. Buy their other CDs, not this shoddy compilation. I can't understand how they botched this so badly since their other CDs sound great. The content is first-rate, but this CD is an insult to the Buzzcocks."
4,The birth of POP-PUNK,"This is like the very first pop punk band ever.I love this album.My personal fave is ""Ever Fallen in Love?""My dad and I both think that ""Orgasim Adict"" is a very hilarious song!But other than that, the whole record has a catchy beat.Some songs aren't that great but it's still a good record.But Never Mind the Bollocks kicks it's ass (sorry all you hardcore Buzzcocks fans!)So thus, I give it..4 stars."
2,Avoid this version and buy the import...,"This is a splendid collection of songs, simply one of the greatest punk rock albums ever made. BUT...as previously noted here, the mastering on this CD is pathetically tinny, as bad as I have ever heard a CD sound, and will sound like dreck on anything but the most pathetic boom box. I found it unlistenable, but fortunately the CD has been reissued in Britain with good booming sound. That import is available on Amazon, and should be purchased instead, so you can here these gems in their full five-star glory."
4,Improve on perfection?,"It would be hard to give ""Singles Going Steady"" anything less than 5 stars, ever. In any context.This remaster is, in most cases, excellent. The sound quality is generally better -- but I kept my old, unremastered copy too, if that tells you anything. The new mix is thicker, but I like the rawness of the original mix just as well for high-volume listening.A few of the bonus tracks sap the energy from the original release. But a few of the bonus tracks nest like litter-mates with this already awesome collection of non-album singles.Get this album one way or another -- whether this souped-up version or the older, clankier (but just as pleasing) version.And the ""Spiral Scratch"" EP too."
4,what do you get?,"Is this emo punk? (Does that even exist?) Pete Shelley's voice combines vulnerbility and...um, cockiness at the same time, which is a tempting combination. Its funny-sad. It defies labels. Plus, you don't hear too many orgasming guys in music nowadays. I heard ""What do I get?"" during Ghost World and was throughly disappointed it wasn't on the sound track. I couldn't get the song out of my head, so I got this cd and have no regrets.Plus, they just included a really mediocre remake of ""ever fallen in love?"" in the new shrek movie. Hear just how much better the original is.Standout songs: What do I get, ever fallen in love, everybody's happy nowadays"
3,Singles goi...,"Yeah I usually stop playing the album halfway through. They lost energy and started being ""clever"" with lyrics. I didn't get into punk for a bunch of clever rhymes and clowns wanting to be taken seriously."
5,Mostly great poppy-punk songs,"I always thought the Buzzcocks were a good, not great, band. This cd is definitely great, because it's got many of their best songs on it. Buy it for ""Orgasm Addict"" alone!!! Just listen to the music clips, that's all the proof you will need. Although I could've done without ""Autonomy"". The Buzzcocks had better songs that should've been included! But this is still a great cd."
1,MiniTuner NOT Included!,"Don't be misled, the MiniTuner itself is NOT included in the box! Just the dock and Antenna. The INSTALL GUIDE is titled 'XM Mini-Tuner & XM Mini-Tuner Home Dock Installation Guide', but the MiniTuner is NOT in the box."
4,Eton E1XM satellite radio,"If you have an E1XM, you must get the satellite antenna.Yes, there is a subcription cost ($13) a month for XM only, but it's worth it for the amazing varity and clean signal/sound.There are actually 3 parts to the antenna that you must have.1. Satellite antenna, aimed outside.2. Radio reciver tuner holder, that the antenna plugs into.3. Tuner module which plugs into the holder, which plugs into the E1XM.I really enjoy XM radio for its content, and clean signal.There are almost 200 channels of various kinds of music, news, sports, entertainment, and other things for your listening pleasure most of the time. Schedules for the shows vary with time and date."
5,Had to return it,"Unfortunately, I had to return it as I ordered the wrong item. Nothing wrong with it so I didn't downgrade it."
2,"Probably not a bad product, but make sure you really need it","I purchased the XM home docking kit and tuner under the impression I could use the tuner in a portable device as well as with my home stereo system. It turns out that most, if not all, of the portable devices out there already have a built in tuner and come with a home docking station. Therefore it only makes sense to purchase the home docking kit and tuner if you don't plan on buying a portable receiver. Luckily Amazon customer service is awesome and they are taking the device back. Thanks Amazon, great as always!"
1,Odds are you don't want this.,"This requires a receiver unit with a special jack to plug the XM antenna into.They don't make them anymore, and they only made them briefly.So don't buy this, its a complete waste of money."
2,Better off with separate Tuner,I found this after the 2009 Christmas rush at a Best Buy. All of 2010 I had issues with it failing to tune correctly with my Yamaha Receiver. Sometimes you could not select any channels without having to pull out the tuner from the dock and reinstalling.When it worked it worked OK. But when we bought a Toyota vehicle I was surprised that I would not receive any discount for having more then one receiver? The only discounts XM radio gives is if you pay ahead by a year or so. Great for them because they get to keep your money and invest it. After less then a year I have cancelled it because it really is kind of expensive when you considerits content. Even music only is $10 a month and if you have two receiver that get's doubled now! I certainly do not like commercial radio anymore but not because of the commercials. I just wanted a more diverse music selection. Unless you spend a lot of time listening you are better off with a iPod or free radio.
4,"Great, If Your Not A Critic.","I f you can stand the dubbing, this is a top notched adventure movie. The voices are very squeaky, but after a while you will get used to it. The action scenes are great, even though the punch sounds are very fake. There is only three main action scenes alpthough this is more of a adventure than action movie. I recommend you rent this and if you still like it buy it."
4,Splendid sequel to one of Chan's all-time greats.,"Without Yuen Biao and Sammo Hung in the sequel, many wondered how Jackie would fare in Project A 2. The answer was blasted onto the screen in another of Chan's masterpieces. Although not quite up to the dizzy heights of Project A, the sequel still features some of the craziest and most inventive pieces of action ever seen. The stunt filled finale makes Hollywood pale in comparison. (It's also very well directed!)."
4,O.K. if your not picky,"If you can get over the HORRID dubbing and the cheap punch sounds, the widescreen part, and get over the fact theres is not a whole lot of action this could be a good adventure movie. I think its worth the money the money if your not picky about movies. It is not a very great jackie movie. Its not that he is not good at kung fu its just the bad guys are so hard he doesn't really get in the rythm of beating up a lot of guys like he does in project a 1. I think its a very fun movie if you are patient and have fun watching it. As for the dubbing, they scream and sqeak. If you watch it more than once you will get use to this."
1,WARNING,"This movie is NOT in widescreen format, as described above. It is formatted for the TV screen, which means that not only do you lose 2/3 of the action, but you lose 2/3 of the subtitles, rendering them unreadable! This might be a great movie (I suspect it is from what I watched) but I couldn't tell from this wretched tape!"
4,"Good, but not as good as the first","This movie was pretty good, but after watching the first, I expected just a little bit more fighting and a little more comedy. The first had more comedy and the stunts were better. Despite that, the movie was still pretty good."
1,very disappointed!,"The title of the book is very misleading! this is not in any way an advanced book. I've been beading for about 4-5 years and would consider myself an advanced beader, this book offers information that would be great for anyone starting out in the wonderful world of beadwork and jewelry making. If you have been making jewelry and/or beadwork for more than a few months this book is not for you, it is for the total novice who would like an all-in-one reference book of different techniques, but there are much better books out there! This will now be collecting dust on my book shelf and may be taken out only when I teach a student who has never done ANY beadwork before... very disappointed!"
2,"Not bad, but not great","This book has illustrated instructions and is ok for ideas, but it is not particularly detailed in it's approach. But it does cover a large range of techniques and is good if you want to explore a bunch of different things."
3,Dorman Lock Actuators 746-014,With the most recent ones of these I bought the plastic pin on the back that goes through the door mounting bracket doesnt line up (in the wrong spot) so had to cut it off and used all 4 bolts on the bracket so seems to work. Also the packaging is smaller and this time at least comes with the rivets.. NOTE: says made in China.... the last ones before these were in a bigger package no rivets but the plastic pin was in the correct spot. Not a big deal but FYI..
2,VDO Unit Is Better Choice,"I tried both the Dorman 746-014 and the VDO AC89312 and the VDO product is much better,VDO AC89312 Door Lock Actuator. The Dorman did not have enough power to lock and unlock my door and did not fit properly in the bracket of my 89 Jeep. However, the VDO fit perfectly and worked perfectly. Both are about the same price."
4,I'll drink to this one,"Reading Jack London's ""John Barleycorn"" is like attending an AA meeting almost 50 years before they were instituted. London herein gives his story of life with alcohol, and it is much like those you hear in the rooms. Beginning with denial, then the drinking becomes a morning thing, then on the sly, the progression is classic alcoholism. Along the way, London includes enough autobiographical information that this is more than just a booze tale. Interestingly, London -- a devout socialist -- constantly harps on the need for prohibition in this country as a way to end the danger of alcoholism. And we all know how that worked out. I'm, an alcoholic, so I appreciated the book on one level. London is my favorite author, and this is one of his good efforts. It's not a depressing tale but one that is uplifting. I recommend it.(Review by Tom Bruce)"
1,I received a DVD that doesn't work on my DVD player,DVD doesn't work on my DVD player now it will be my problem to have to spend money to return it . Not Happy
5,"""The Turning Point""","The DVD ""Turning Point"" is exceptionally well done. It shows the struggles and the hard work involved in becoming an international ballet dancer while also depicting the turmoil of one who had the dream and the talent but did not follow her dream. The DVD also includes the dancers of The American Ballet Theatre as well as Mikhail Baryshnikov who is a legend himself."
5,Ballet at it's best,"This is a well-acted, beautiful film that shows the dancers, especially Mikhail Baryshnikov. at the top of their game. Wonderful film!"
3,Turning Point - OK film,"The Turning Point was an Ok movie, not outstanding but good. I especially liked the performances of Shirley MacLaine and Anne Bancroft as the two friends/rivals. I agree with what the other reviewers have said about the dance sequences, beautifully done and very realistic. Mikhail Baryshnikov was good as well but the relationship that develops between him and Shirley MacLaine's daughter wasn't very interesting, this was the low point in the movie for me. But the fight scene between Bancroft and Maclaine is excellent."
2,Seeing is not hearing.,"I gave it a 2, because it didn't have sub-titles and much of the dialogue was very soft. Most films today do have sub titles. I don't hear some TV films as well as I once did, though I'm not hard of hearing ordinarily. Most films I hear are OK, but this one was a NO. And worse than that, no subtitles. So even though the dancing was a 5 and the storyline was a 5, I had no idea what they were all saying to each other though having seen it in the movies years ago, I knew what was going on most of the time. Bad idea not to include sub titles. English films, especially the series type English films rarely have them, and often many of the characters have strong dialects, so I can't understand half the stuff they say. I'm glad most American made films do have sub titles, but unfortunately this one didn't."
5,A Wonderful Ballet Film,"This movie has some of the best ballet sequences filled with technical virtousity! Filled with the top ballet dancers of the time - Suzanne Farrell, Peter Martins, Marcia Haydee, Richard Cragun, and many, many, more! I highly recommend this movie for those who love ballet, and want to see a heartfelt movie!"
3,There are better ballet films,"Enjoyable, but Baryshnikov is somehow embarrassing, Leslie Browne and/or her character is a drip, and it could have done with more ballet and less arched-eyebrow angst from the leading ladies. It was originally cast with ballerina Gelsey Kirkland - she and Misha, with whom she was having a destructive relationship, were supposed to be more or less playing themselves - but she got out of it. I think one can see why.Better (but for some reason less well known) ballet films are White Nights or The Company, in my opinion. (I haven't seen Black Swan but if you want a good giggle check out all the 1-star Amazon reviews of it!)."
1,A Storm of Vulgar Language and Vulgar Emotions,"I am very surprised that this movie had this high ratings. I may agree with others on the right casting, but this was not my genre. I mean, I love watching ballet but I hated to see ballet connected with divorce, alcohol, sexual relationships before marriage, jealous, mean words and actions, and swearing words. It was a very ugly movie with a beautiful ballet. The dance was exquisite but I didn't enjoy it at all because I didn't like the characters at all. When my daughter covered her ears, I had to turn it off. The peace came back as soon as it was shut off. I picked this movie because it was on the government's pick list, but I don't think my Heavenly Father wants me to watch this again."
4,Bought this movie just to watch...,It was worth keeping my video recorder to see films that are not yet on affordable DVDs. This movie has some great moments like the dance series at the end with Mikhail - just amazing beauty and elegance in his prime. Its what he's known for... such a gift.
5,Great BeBop Intro...,This album is a great primer for those of you entering into the jazz scene and looking for something to cut your teeth on...has alot of the major players on the BeBop scene from back in the day!
3,Miscellaneous,"This Cd offers a curious mixture of rhytmic suites and concertos and ""early baroque"" sonatas. The sonatas of Heinrich Bach are the less exciting moments of this Cd. You also have a 17 minutes piece of harpsichord solo of J.Chr.Bach which is quite long,and in my point of wiew,a little boring. The big surprise for me was to discover one sonata of Cyriacus Wilche (?) and another of Sighr.Pagh.(?) The latter give a real pleasure to the listener with an agressive virtuose violon. A crescendo full of vitality which explosed like a volcano ! Outstanding performances by the musicians. It's sound like the ""Sonata a 5 (D. Becker) and perhaps more like the ""Sonata Der Polnische Pracher"" from J.V. Meder (Musica Baltica, Musica Antiqua Koln-R. Goebel, 1999, Archiv 459 619-2).On the whole, this Cd let me perplexed.At least, we have the honnor to hear the master Goebel himself play violin !"
3,Rare repertoire but abrasive playing,"Some of these pieces--all worth hearing for musical values--are not now available in any other performances. The playing, while vigorous and generally sound in intonation, often has an abrasive edge--a quality that I associate with less recent performances in the ""authentic"" style--while many more recent performances sound smoother or more polished. At times the playing seems brusque. If this group and its manner of performance are for you, then you doubtless will like the disk; otherwise you may have some reservations."
3,Works ONLY for PowerMac (older mac towers),This AppleCare will only work on older mac towers labeled PowerMac. If you have a Mac Pro labeled tower this number will not work for you. Apple will just tell you it was already registered but the the truth is they don't want to cover their newer machines with the older AppleCare prices.
1,trucker Movies,"I recieved this movie and didn't care for it--I am not saying that this movie is bad , but I just didn't care for it."
1,Enervite,My puppy didt like the enervite so have an unwanted tube it wasn't exactly a great price either !! Maybe someone else might have better luck with their pooch !! :(
5,Another great book!,"I am still reading this book and having insights about how important it is to be free from resentments, fears, etc. to be clear and receptive to the flow of abundance."
5,The Pragmatic RUP Introduction,"There is plenty of theory written about RUP, but how it should be applied to your role or your project is often misunderstood.This book not only provides the overview, but the contextual guidance to make RUP work for you.As a long-term RUP mentor and user, I highly recommend it."
3,A bit dry...,"Compared to ""Peer Reviews in Software: A Practical Guide"" or ""Best Kept Secrets of Code Review"", this one was a bit dry. The others were a good read and I would recommend them over this title."
5,Good material. Not for beginners!,"Systematic thought regarding human behavior and software inspection. This is a heavier weight text that requires a little experience prior to understanding the context of why you care. That being said, it has always been one of my favorites in terms of helping one understand the value of inspection, the method, context and timing. Is inspection right in every situation and so forth? No, of course not. Do you want a clue? Yes. This book competes quite nicely with something else called the ""Fagan Inspection"" method by Michael Fagan .. and is cheaper to acquire and apply."
2,Embarrasing performance,"First off I am a big fan of Meat Loaf so I hate rating this so low. But here goes..On the first line on the first song ""All Revved Up With No Place To Go"" he wasn't even near the melody of the song. I'm talking WAY off here....not just a little flat or sharp. As I continued to watch it became clear to me that something was terribly wrong with Meat that night.The band is hot but because of Meat's poor performance I'm sure I'll never watch this again. It was just too painful.It's no wonder this DVD isn't even mentioned on Meat Loaf's official website.This product should have never seen the light of day."
1,Meat past his best - his vocals have gone!,"I've ben a huge fan for years & have seen ML over a dozen times.All I can say is that he is now past it, his vocals are woeful on this DVD & he ends up ruining some greast songs.A great backing band try to make up for Meat's shortcomings, but sadly he doesn't have the range any more & his tempo & timing are pityful at times. He chooses to change the vocal melody on so many of the songs & often finds himself rushing the end of each line of lyrics to catch up with the next line! It's infuriating to listen to, especially when he's rarely in tune.I hate to say this, but he should have overdubbed most of this performance & he should listen back to the performance & realise that volume does not make up for singing flat!I wish I hadn't bought this, although I give it one star for the great backing band & vocals & a good documentary included on the bonus disc (UK version)"
2,Disappointment,"I'm a long-time Meatloaf fan and was really looking forward to this. While the old songs still stand up and and are great to hear, Meatloaf, at least in this concert, just doesn't cut it vocally. God bless him he's trying but the range and sound just isn't there anymore."
1,special version??,interestingly the special version containing the 2 disks is available all over Europe including Amazon-UK. I find it interesting and disappointing that not only isn't it listed as available here in the US but that even the basic information is not included for this single disk. I hope (and assume) that this will be fixed and the special version will also be available in the US. I'm giving it 1 star not for the content from the tour but for the fact it isn't the special version and the content on the site.
1,Meatloaf live....,The only thing I wanted to hear on here was the Bat Out Of Hell album songs which are not well done at all on this set. I'm astonished that reviews claim this to be Meat Loaf at his best when it clearly is far from it to anyone without talent deafness. If you watch the BOH/BOH II tours and even the welcome to the neighbour tours meat is anything but on top of his game here. His voice shines in very few places on bats live and is mostly terrible. Not a good live performance.
2,Disappointing,"After seeing Meat Loaf Live in Melbourne, this concert was a great disappointment. Although Aspen is a capable singer, she is no Patty Russo. Also, it seems like Meat picked the worst songs from Bat out of hell 3 for this concert. If you really love Meat Loaf, get 'Live in Melbourne'."
3,Okay show.,Caught this show recently on HD Net and thought it was just okay. It was obvious Meat was not at the top of his game. Having seen it in HD quality was rather disgusting toward the end of the show... it looked like Meat had puke in his mouth or something chewed up and not yet swallowed. What the heck was that?
1,HORRIBLE -- Did he have marbles in his mouth??,"This DVD was HORRIBLE - Meatloaf sings as though he has marbles in his mouth, warbles through almost all songs and seems to be out of tune, missing the beat. Throw in the ""F"" word a couple times for shock value -- this disc should end up in the garbage -- don't waste your money. A big disappointment."
5,Yee-haw! I love this movie!,"Saw this first when I was about 10 or so and I missed most of the gay jokes, but I LOVED the fencing. Now, 20 years later, I am an anomaly: A straight male in theatre, but now, I get all the gay jokes and it STILL cracks me up! Watch this movie if you're looking for swashbuckling fun!THANK GOD FOR SMALL FAVORS!"
4,They didn't miss the target for a foot,"Having forgot about this film for about of a century , it was almost as a new descoverta. Absolutely both funny and silly, the movie is one of the best of its era: the script is a good mix of making fun of Zorro's and his and our time's machismo, the main characters are all played tongue in cheek, it's an ensemble picture. Many scenes are so outrageous and unexpected that you can only laugh and laugh all the time. It's not Love at First Bite, but still it is a solid comedy.Best line: Diego Vega's ""You are sitting on my foot"" to Florinda, with the best ever seen ""almost I'm going to die"" face by Mr. Hamilton.Best scene: the whole Diego Vega's and Esteban's ""walking and running and jumping in place"" with the final ""Florinda you aren't hurt""."
5,Zorro the Gay Blade,This DVD was shipped out promptly and arrived in very good condition. The DVD was in perfect condition and played great - nothing wrong with it.
3,Offensively funny send-up,"This is not a great movie, but it is a hoot. George Hamilton is enjoyable as Zorro and his alter-ego, his gay brother. However, it is with the scenery eating Ron Leibman and Brenda Vaccaro as the governor and his loopy wife, where the most fun lies. Seriously non-PC these days because of the hammy Spanglish, the film is nonetheless a deliciously guilty pleasure."
1,Offensive and Not funny,"I saw this movie years ago on VHS and found it rather unfunny. Recently I viewed LOVE AT FIRST BITE and loved it as much as the first time I saw it years ago. So I thought I'd give ZORRO, THE GAY BLADE another chance. My opinion hasn't changed. The ""humor"" in this film is so heavy-handed and forced that very little elicits laughs. There's really nothing terribly funny about George Hamilton playing a flaming faggot and dressing in outlandish costumes. There's nothing terribly funny about Rob Leibman screaming constantly. What was clever and gentle and affectionate in the Dracula spoof is simply offensive and tedious in this. Had it been made 20 years earlier, I could see where the creators of it might think they were ground-breaking; in 1981, no way! I hate to come off sounding self-righteous and snobbish and lacking in sense of humor. But this film is simply NOT FUNNY. Sorry to disagree with all the customers who raved about it."
2,Maybe fun for older people,"I could not just laugh, although I did not find this movie offensive/politically incorrect at all. Put simply, extremely dated --- I could not believe the fact that this was produced in 1981. It looked like 1971 instead. Probably this movie might be funny only for people who are older than 50 yrs old."
4,Zorro with a Twist,I really have enjoyed this movie. I remembered seeing it a long time ago and it is just as funny now as it was then. George Hamilton at his funniest. If you want a good laugh and a twist of George I recommend it highly.
5,I love this video.,"It is a great parity of the Zorro series. The more you watch it, the more ""little"" things you see that were put in it for detail. The five, actually six, main caracters are absolutely hilarious. It is loads of fun. My family and friends have loved it from the beginning. I always felt it was before its time."
3,Transfer? WHAT transfer?,"Three stars.....five for the movie which is just as funny as I remember. NO stars for the transfer, which looks like it came off a 16mm print. Grainy and dark, there is no excuse for this. Unfortunately, it seems to be the only version of this movie out there. So if you want it, here it is, warts and all."
2,Zorro the Lame,"I was extremely disappointed. I had seen the original movie release years ago, and was excited to buy the DVD. However, much of the original movie is missing! They have taken the edited down version from TV and made it into a DVD. None of the really hilarious parts were left intact.....therefore some parts of the movie don't even make sense! I wish someone would release the original movie in it's entirety, not such a watered-down, hacked-up shadow of the Gay Blade Zorro I knew and loved."
5,A MOVIE PARODY MEL BROOKS WILL PROUD OF,"Peter Medak directs this HILARIOUS film based on the character created by Johnston McCulley. After his AMAZING SUCCESS in spoof Bram Stoker's ""DRACULA"" in 'LOVE AT FIRST BITE', George Hamilton returned to film this picture. Hamilton plays 'DON DIEGO VEGA', the son of the original 'ZORRO'. When he returns to California for the funeral of his father, 'DIEGO' soon learns that he has inherited the mantle of ""ZORRO"". Not ONLY THAT, he ALSO learns that he has a LONG LOST IDENTICAL TWIN BROTHER. After an accidental fall, which leaves him with a swollen foot, 'DIEGO' is soon reunited with his brother, 'RAMON'. (Who turns out to be a foppish homosexual). George Hamilton is EXTREMELY HILARIOUS in the dual role of 'DON DIEGO VAGA' & 'RAMON VEGA/BUNNY WIGGLESWORTH'. Ron Liebmann is also very good as the villain. Brenda Vaccaro and Lauren Hutton round out the cast as the female leads."
4,The funniest film ever made!,"I saw this film when i was 10, and it has stayed with me since. it is a classic."
5,Are you kidding?,This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. The camera work is exceptional!My sister and I had seen this movie so many times that we had the dialog memorized front and back.It's hilarious!
4,SUMMERY,WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT GEORGE HAMILTON'S ACTING IN THIS FILM? HE SEEMED TO HAVE SUCH FUN WHILE FILMING IT. IT'S JUST A FUNNY FAMILY FILM.
5,Happy to finally get this classic,"Zorro the Gay Blade has become a cult classic and finding copies of it on DVD is not so easy (and certainly not cheap when you can find it). I was thrilled to see the price drop a bit, and coupled with an Amazon gift coupon, I got one of my favorite movies for a reasonable price. It arrived in excellent condition, and the DVD played without any issues."
4,Spoof Zorro,"George Hanilton had already spoofed Dracula and the vampire genre in the filmLove at First Bite, this time he took his satirical aim at Zorro. He pokes a big finger of 1940's Tyrone Power The Mark of ZorroHamilton could have played this Zorro straight and would have made this work. However, in a comedy twist, when his Dom Diego character hurts his foot in an Zorro related accident, he enlisted his long lost brother Ramone (now called Bunny Wigglesworth)(Also played by Hamilton) in his Zorro cause..and the fun begins.Bunny plays Zorro in many colorful zorro garbs, rather than the normal Zorro basic black. Instead of a sabre he uses a whip. He pokes a more whisher Zorro wit (Note the film's title)Ron Leibman whine and screams in a germany goosestepping voice as Captain Esteban Pasquale. His nonsensible yelling makes his words almost unhearable to most other than to dogs.It is a cute send up to the ZORRO mytho..I wish it was currently on DVD to enjoy by the massesBennet Pomerantz Audioworld"
4,One of the Great Memories of the Eighties,I was four when this film came out. I loved it then and I love it now. It's a true spoof classic up there with Naked Gun and Hot Shots! If you have an ounce of humor in you you won't want to miss George Hamilton twirling both his swords ( no pun intended ). Have fun and get this film.
5,Love This Movie,"It just doesn't get any funnier than this! Silly, campy but I laughed til I cried. Was glad to find a vendor that didn't want $70 for this out of print gem."
4,Great movie buy from Amazon,Hello Amazon:A good used copy of Zorro The Gay Blade for less than the shipping!... That is a great price for me. It would take forever to see this particular movie on Netflix becausae there is an extremely long waiting list for some reason....The movie is great fun! I can't tell the difference between my used copy and a new copy as it plays on the big screen.Thanks Amazon for connecting me with the right dealer.
4,glad to have it back,i am just to have this back on dvd. though at first i thought it was a bootleg copy. because the cover looked funny and the movie quality is a little suspect. but i am glad to have the film again.
4,Entertaining~,It was a great movie and arrived quickly from the date of purchase. I was very satisfied with my purchase and overall experience.
4,Nice...,"The clearity not the best. Very humorous in keeping with the parody.If you are a G. H. fan you can't go wrong. Just OK with the print. In Lakewood, Colorado"
5,There is something wrong with your bowels..,"This movie cracks me up. If I feel bad, Just pop it in... and I am laughing in minutes. Enjoy and Enjoy over & over"
5,New Edition Now Available,"From the Publisher:The new edition of this book is now available. See 1931332266 - SOFTWARE METRICS: BEST PRACTICES FOR SUCCESSFUL IT MANAGEMENTby Paul GoodmanPublished August, 2004."
5,This is Great!!,"This griddle can cook 8 pieces of French toast at once, without excessive crowding. The pan heats very evenly, so that even portions not over the burners are hot, and the parts over the burners are not too hot! Nothing sticks (of course), and you can feed a crowd. This is a great buy. We own several Calphalon hard anondized pans, but this was my first nonstick. The nonstick surface seems much more durable than that of my T-fal set. This griddle is highly recommended."
5,Fantastic Griddle!,"My electric griddle died, and my husband suggested getting one that works on the stove...no more cords to keep track of or to wear out! The griddle works great! Evenly distributes heat, and terrific non-stick surface. Very easy to clean. This would be a purchase you would NOT regret!"
4,Jack and the Beanstalk,You will pee your pants - so corny but so funny. It's still a scream. Watch it with your kids and grandkids - they might appreciate us folk who are past 60.
2,2nd bad dvd,I ordered 2 of these and they were both the same. The dvd had pot marks (indentations) in it and when it got to that area my dvd player froze and I had a heck of a time getting it to open to take it out. I can understand getting one bad but the replacement was exactly the same. Getting a refund. They obviously got bad discs when making this particular movie. I will wait a while in hopes they will change the discs.
2,best strings,"the .10 .13 and .17 all rusted, probably because they weren't stainless steal they were regular. hope this review helps."
2,Stick With Normal Green Regular Slinky,"I'm not a fan of coated strings to begin with, but I like EB Regular Slinky's so thought I would give these a try. These bottom 3 coated strings are pretty lifeless and they certainly did not last any longer. I'll stick to the green EB Regular Slinky's which always sound good."
4,"FUNNY, SHOCKING, PROFANE, PROFOUND, BEAUTIFUL","SICK (Lions Gate) is a caustic, brilliant, funny, compassionate look at the life and death of comedian Bob Flanagan, who embraced S/M to manage the pain of cystic fibrosis. You will be shocked and amazed and moved to tears of laughter and sadness all at once. This edgy, arty, documentary record of a performance artist with something deeply meaningful to say about the ironic paradoxes of pain and pleasure, and the unexpected gift of life and certain death is not for everyone. So open your mind, see it, and be a better human."
5,it was a good date movie,"I saw Sick during its theatrical release with the man who is now my permanent boyfriend , we shared an immediate appreciation for the bizzare nature of the movie and I realized that even beautifull unattainable cover boys have a weird side to them, weve been together for 4 years I highly reccomend Sick"
3,Look between Bob's leg! He's sporting 'wood'!,"If you are having trouble 'getting wood', just nail some on like Bob does."
3,A Decent Buy,"I first heard the Beu Sisters open for the Independent Tour, and I admit I wasn't a huge fan of their music. However, I ended up downloading a few of their songs (Crushed, Decisions, I Was Only (Seventeen), Once Upon a Broken Heart) and thought they were pretty catchy. In terms of style, The Beu Sisters probably lay somewhere between bubblegum pop and folk-pop (if that even is a genre). The CD has a few weak points (Why Don't You Just Kiss Me, Christmas in June), but it's worth the buy for most of the other songs. Definitely upbeat and happy for the most part - good for playing in your car on a sunny day :D"
2,A&B: Not so good.,"I've heard in the past that this was a staple of Ultimate DVDs. Perhaps it is, but I own much better DVDs from ultivillage. The game footage is from poor angles and does not show complete games. There are better ultimate DVDs out there - don't buy this one."
3,An Oliphaunt,"I'm just struck by the choice of an Oliphaunt on the cover, especially when seen at the eye-level of a Halfli--oops, I mean, Hobbit."
3,An unfortunate mix of wonderful and horrible,"There are some excellant illustrations by Nasmith, Howe, Lee and others which leap out of the page at you and bring the Middle Earth to life. Other images must have been chosen from children's editions of the Tolkien books and look like something the kids brought home from school art class currently hanging on the front of the refridgerator. I don't know what politically correct art chic caused the editors to feel that had to balance the beauty with the crud, but it created a truely unfortunate blend of imagery. It's an OK coffee table book for the Tolkien fan, but it could have been so much better if the editors had used their power to create a book of outstanding illustrations, rather than a collection representing all illustrators, even the artistically challenged ones."
4,"A good collection, though not without flaws.","This collection contains some fantastic art, but also some which will certainly not appeal to all tastes. I guess the beauty of this collection is that it contains such a diversity of art; so though it is probable that there will be some you don't like there should be more that you do. If you are a fan of fantasy art it should appeal, if you are a Tolkien fan with a minimal interest in Middle Earth art then it may still appeal, such is the quality of some of it, but may not appeal enough. Certainly worth considering though as it is well put together."
4,Definately not what i expected. But still excellent,"I mean that in a good way, but the guitar just wasnt heavy enough, but the vocals were excellent. The lyrical content was so graphic and disgusting that it was funny, like the song Polyps they sing about how someones extremely bad case polyps takes over and kills, what a horrible way to go. I think the singer took a few medical classes and some hands on anatomy, funny stuff.When I first opend the cd and saw the band members i was expecting them to be dissecting a cow with blood everywhere and the members would have long hair and wear all black, but instead they were actually neatly presentable which blew my mind but it was a suprising change, thats another i like about them, they dont really look like Grind Death but they sure as hell can play it."
3,A WORK OF EXTREME SOUNDS,"Well, this is a good CD, not great, not excellent, just good. I really don't think that the vocalist can produce all the growls by himself, some device must be use, or really he needs to see a doctor. Anyway, it manages to create good sounds, great mix of the band, and a good adrenaline bust. It makes you want to get in the card and step on it. By the way, the ""clean"" means the cover, all the songs are in their original glory with gore and guts and cursing and the rest.Now, all the lyrics are full of gore images, and to some, disgusting topics. I'm not into goremetal, so I wouldn't know, but for me, they are not that awful as Cannibal Corpse. In summary, if you like grindcore and all similar styles, go ahead, you won't regret it. For me, Bolt Thrower is far much better band, but way superior to High on Fire."
4,more like 3.5 stars....,"first thing i noticed about this album was the change in the drumming. and its not for the better. my favorite thing about ""To Serve Man"" were those lightning-fast blast beats that you could actually HEAR. he might as well not be hitting the snare drum on this one, you cant hear it! the vocals are better though, and the intro is really cool."
1,wtf??,"Well there you have it again another over blown crappy death/grind band beening pushed because of the recent surge in record sales of this genre. I still can't get over metal blade hyping up this no talent trash but then again metal blade have had several steaming piles released over the last few years.The sound is just revolting almost as if the producer pluged the mics into the room next to were cd was recording. If you want real grindcore check out Cryptopsy, Cephalic carnage, Brutal truth, are Exit 13 and leave this vegan bs in the trash heap were it belongs i would of given it zero stars but owell and by the way eat meat lol"
1,Moron Metal,"Let's just say I didn't buy this album, but I was able to hear it thanks to a close friend. I have come to the conclusion that the humorously named band Cattle Decapitation has to be one of the most talent-less bands on the planet. They only really get noticed by their silly name (hey, it worked on me) and their revolting/moronic album covers. I would actually be embarrassed to purchase ""Humanure."" Take your money and go else where to buy good metal."
3,"Everything seems great, but too much plastic","I wanted an all-in-one processor for my tiny kitchen, and after reading all the reviews, I bought this one. I thought it was really neat, though I only tried the 2 jar attachments. The 2nd time I used the large jug to chop carrots, and I found a piece of plastic in the dessert I prepared with the carrots. I checked the jar, and sure enough, a piece of plastic had chipped off from the inside of the jar.I returned it today - I may buy the same thing (if the prices come down again); will 1st check if there's a better quality combo processor."
2,Disposable,"My wife and I loved this mixer. I wasn't sure we needed it, we have a blender that works well. After the first use, we didn't used the blender again.That was until last week, a few months past the one year warranty. It just stopped working. I expect a longer lifetime for a premium kitchen appliance that costs this much. Customer service asked many questions for their quality control, but would not assist with any warranty work. Only one and a half years of use out of this blender is not worth the price.I took it to the repair store. They said they cannot repair it. It was made to be disposable. There is no way to open it without breaking it.I would recommend any other less expensive hand blender."
1,Broken and disposable,"I had less than one year's use with this product and it broke - and I mean light use. It broke when I was was grinding parmesan cheese. It's obviously a disposable item, as i can't find a source to fix it. And I paid $20 more than it is being offerd for now. I'm going back to more manual ways of doing things."
5,Highly recommend!,"This blender kit is great for everything from mixing drinks/smoothies to making baby food to using as a hand blender (w/whisk attachment) ... and more! A+ design, and best of all clean up is relatively simple!"
1,"Great, until it stops working a couple months after warranty","I loved the blender and all its many attachments, but it just died while I was using it to chop herbs. The local service center said that it wasn't worth repairing as it was no longer covered under the warranty. The first time it broke, the store replaced it, but now I am without a blender and have tons of attachments just wasting space. I think I'll go with a Kitchenaid as I have always had good luck with their products...for the price I paid for the Braun ($99), I definitely feel like it should have lasted much, much longer."
3,Razac better than most,Razac's Wrapmaster is better than most wrapping lotions because the cosistancy is very thick like a conditioner which helps to comb and straighten out your hair while it's wet. It drys well and adds alot of body to your hair. It doesn't get hard like Isoplus and other wrapping lotions I know. The only problem I have with ordering it from Amazon is the weight of the product makes it more expensive in shipping than the actual cost of the product by more than 2 or 3 dollars. If you can't find it in your local beauty supply it's worth getting if you can make it last for awhile.
2,Doesn't work with windows XP,1. Can't get the driver to work under Windows XP.2. No driver download from official website....3. ...because they want to charge you $19.9 for the driver!http://www.driverzone.com/viewcomment.php?company=Olympus%20America&masterid;=501
4,GREAT FOR THE PRICE!!!,This item is a great deal. The software sucks all it can do is hold your recordings. It is very ez to use. I would have of bought the DS-2.Great deal!!
2,It's alright,"This tape recorder isn't bad. It's alright, I mean I probably tried ordering for all the wrong reasons. I ordered it to use it for audio for my movie, but you can definitely not use it for that, I assure you. The software wasn't great either, You have to buy extra software to turn it into an MP3 file, so good luck. Overrall, it would be a great recorder to record speeches, lectures, but nothing beyond on that."
5,4 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:An unforgettable film that captures better than almost any other both the rebellious spirit of youth and the feeling of the 60s, If... is a powerful attack on the British class system, a 2 hour journey with incredibly interesting characters, and above all else a great film."
2,Edited film,"One of the memorable moments in the orginal occurred when one of the faculty matrons took up arms and joined the climactic rebellion. That moment and others inexplicably did not appear in the dvd I received. It was as though someone thought these images too offensive or scathing or something, and decided to take sheers to them.Considering what's out there nowadays on video, this is a most disheartening act, and I'm sorry to even have to report it. Thus, ""If . . "" receives a less than perfect rating from this quarter."
1,I just don't get it?,"Turned it off halfway through.Okay, it's this ""great escapist fantasy that is a landmark in film making"" you all cry, but is it?As a piece of entertainment I found it cold, unengaging and also boring.I'll give it an extra star for Malcolm McDowell, he's superb in anything he does."
2,This recording is not the one you want,"Don't waste your time with this recording, it sucks. The only good CD is the live recording from Carnegie Hall with soprano Alessandra Marc (conducted by Robert Bass)."
1,Bad screen!,"I am working on my home theater, and just ordered this Elite EZ Cinema Plus screens from Amazon. I got it today, I was very disappointed when I openned it. It's very poor quality and has a big black ink spot at the middle of the screen! Come on, it should be a pure white screen, just imagining there is a ulgy black spot at the middle of your face!I saw other online store has better price for this item, but I trust Amazon. I always love shopping from Amazon, and I have many good shopping experience. But this time is really bad. It's a 74 in long & 30lbs big item, and not easy to repack and send back. The big problem I want to setup my home theater before the holiday, but now I don't have a good screen. And I don't think I can do it by Christmas. I feel really bad!"
1,"Absurd description, or False identity","A Legitimate Medium door wall kit could not possibly be 6"" high by 8"" wide or visa/versa,and whats more there are no exterior walls 2"" deep/thick."
2,More info,"Your demesions must be reversed, and if it is titled wall mount why do you describe it as 2"" D? i'm looking for wall mount 12"" tall or a little more have any?"
4,I read it about 5 years ago but....,"I remember that I liked it a lot, enough for me to remember I read it and when. The reason I didn't give it five stars was because I can't remember very much and 5 stars should go to the really amazing, emotional books. But I definatly would like to read this book again if I had the chance. You won't be sorry if you read it!"
3,"Not a bad book, but...","Did it bother anyone else who finished this book that Marlowe drove herself to the horse farm after it mentions TWICE earlier in the book that she doesn't know how to drive? A minor thing, but it really bugged me."
3,On The Couch,This was a fun book. Not perfect but fun. Though I wish the author hadn't gone back and forth in first-person between the two main characters. Each time she did it it jerked me out of the story. It just didn't flow as good as it could but it was still ok. The guy was probably more likable than the girl who was whiny at times and seemed desperate to prove that she didn't need him which only made her look more needy. But there were a couple of good lines here and there and all and all it was a nice love story.
1,But don't take my word for it...,"This book is nothing but fanfiction using pre-defined characters and settings from Sex and the City. It was so rife with rip-offs that I had to put the book down to roll my eyes about two dozen times, and many of the 'twists' were blatently contrived. This book was not even saved by the sex scenes, which were no better than a scene from your traditional sausage-inspired romance tripe. It's only saving grace was that the cover skipped the fabio-style long-haired blonde guy with a nipple peaking out of his poufy pirate shirt, and instead went with a cute little kitty. Awww...However, this book is a quick read, I'll give you that."
1,"Dull, uninspiring book","How a novel with such a titillating concept could be SO boring, I'll never know. Marlowe is a psychologist who pretends to be a hooker to get information for her research project. Joe is cop who pretends to be a client to find out if Marlowe is the ""escort"" who killed a man. Both characters are dull and unbelievable. The plot developed SOOOOOO SLOOOOOOOWLY, I gave up about half way through and never finished the book. I read another of Author Alisa Kwitney's books, ""The Dominant Blonde,"" and enjoyed it, but after reading this one, I'd be reluctant to try another."
3,Channels stop working,"I've had this set for 2 years now and until about a month ago I was totally pleased with it. Now it seems that the set won't accept any input from the remote control after about 10-20 minutes. Nothing will work, can't change channels, change the volume, or anything. I have to turn it off manually and then I can turn it on again with the remote and it will work fine for again 10-20 minutes. I thought it might be a remote problem but I used a universal remote and it did the same thing. Of course the warranty expired a while back."
5,Keeps the interest of young readers and has great value as a story,"I'm a first grade teacher and we read this story in one of my reading groups. My students loved the story. It sparked their imagination and they had a great time thinking of what they would do with a magic paint brush. I loved the moral in the story, too. I wish I had a better copy than my old beaten up one. Hopefully someone will re-release this because my students are proof that this generation of kids would love the story."
5,The Magic of Art,"Ma Lien wanted to be an artist painter, but he was so poor he couldn't even afford a brush. Nevertheless, he drew pictures when and where he could with what he could: his finger in wet sand, a stone to scratch on a flat rock; he even drew on the walls of his hut.Fortunately, a wise old wizard had noticed Ma Lien's talent and heard his longings to be an artist. He gave Ma Lien a magical brush. The brush had great power because whatever Ma Lien drew...would come to life. Now just think of all the good or evil that such a brush could do. Ma Lien wanted to do good with the brush, but the Ruler of the Land had other ideas. Ma Lien was only a boy, so what could he do?

5,Great 3 season bag,"For the money this bag can't be beat!I bought this bag 3 years ago and have used it several times a year and have had no issues. It is light and comfortable.I bought this bag because of the cost, how light it is and the 30F rating. I've been camping with it in 40F weather and I wouldn't recommend much colder then that for this bag. For colder temps, use a good mat.It's not meant as a ""sleep on the floor"" or ""around the house"" bag. This bag is meant to be packed into a backpack and used in a tent, otherwise get a down bag.I'm 5'8"" and had no issues with the bag size, up to 6' is probably good."
2,You get what you pay for,"I bought this bag for a 7 day bivouac hunt in the North Dakota Badlands. The average nightly temps were 40-50 F. The bag was warm during these windy and chilly nights. The bag compresses down reasonably small and is relatively light weight. On my second night of the hunt, I was zipping up the bag and the zipper broke right off of the bag. It didn't just come off, it literally broke. There was no way to fix this in the back country. I had my hunting buddy wrap some duct tape around me at night and then unwrap me like a giant tamalie every morning. He spent big $$$ for his bag and of course, had zero problems with it. Oh well, for the price and free shipping, this isn't too bad of a deal, just remember to bring plenty of duct tape with you."
3,Interesting but...,"We have here an interesting and at times a far-reaching exploration of word origins. At times, it is also so far-reaching it seems disconnected from the root. The material whets the appetite but does not go far enough. The authors have a sense of humor but that is not enough to carry the book."
1,Complete farce,"This is the example music biz write Bob Lefsetz gives of something a label produces, using its own employees, in order to qualify them for membership in NARAS so they vote for the label's artists in the Grammy's. To Bob's due credit, he passed along word in a follow-up that NARAS changed its policy two years ago - but I nonetheless have to mention it here where not only are there six horrid clips but two completely shill reviews by unknowns who've reviewed nothing but this quasi-release. Gotta question anything Jive releases, if they'll put this out *and* promo it with farcical reviews.I'd rather Bob put out an album. He could sing about NARAS instead of Christmas."
5,EXCELLENT,"I HEARD THIS ALBUM WHEN IT ORIGINALLY CAME OUT IN 1990,AND NOW IN 2004 IT STILL HAS THE SAME IMPACT ON ME. THAT IS BECAUSE THE THE MESSAGE OF THE SONGS ARE TIMELESS HOWARD IS AN AWESOME SINGER,BUT MORE THEN THAT HE IS A WORSHIPPER OF CHRIST AND IT COMES THROUGH IN HIS MUSIC. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PROJECT. ITIS A CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF OF HOW POWERFUL CHRISTIAN MUSIC CAN BE WHEN IT REALLY COMES FROM THE HEART.."
3,Women in Track and Field,I enjoyed this book but did find it somewhat juenille in context. It covers many famous women runners from Wilma Rudolph to Flo Jo and also gives a good history of how women got started in track and field and the barriers they had to overcome. I would like to see a book of this type expanded with more information and history behind some of these great athletes. When I finished this book I donated it to my son's junior high school library.
2,Item was much too small(Item runs incredibly small!),"I normally take a medium to a large(wiast 34) and this item arrived, brand new, and arrived fast, however, it did not fit at all. This item runs incredibly small! (more like a small than a large!) I wasted my money on this item."
2,Abner Morse: Genealogical Register of the Inhabitants and History of the Towns of Sherborn and Holliston,"The genealogical errors in this book didn't surprise me, it is well known that the author was often less than accurate with his research; what did surprise me was the very poor quality of this reprint.Having seen the original and copied pages on a copy machine, I feel there is no excuse for the blank pages, photos almost blank, pages half-printed, etc.I read your disclaimer asking the customer to be understanding ""of the imperfections in the preservation process."" However, it is difficult to be understanding when you purchase a book for information and are unable to read or even see the information sought.A very poor job."
5,A powerful insight into the madness of the late 60's,"I fall short of giving this book a 10 because it lacks the ""human"" touch offered in Abbie Hoffman's books of the same era. Jerry was a great social organizer who, like Abbie, saw how wrong our country was... and tried to change it. This book will shock many a young conservative with it's brutal history from an era of hippies, pot, free love, and the questionable right to peacefully assemble. You may question his motives and you may disagree with his tactics....but Jerry WAS a true AmeriKan patriot. In the following decades he made lots of money on yogurt health drinks and the stock market.....oh well....read The Best Of Abbie Hoffman for a more clear and concise history ""from the street."""
3,missing,"Hello,There is a song missing on this dvd, Killing me softly. I bought this dvd for the next numbers: my way, whenever i call you friend, show me the way, if you leave me now, fame and killing me softly. So you understand that i was disappointed. For the rest it's a fine dvd."
2,Too expensive,"This book is just waay, too expensive, brand new, I know college texts are usually expensive, but this just seems a little bit over the top to me.I think there are other text which are just as good, and even better, which schools can use which are not this pricey."
1,Horrible,"I bought this anime only because I was at the mall and I felt like buying something. Sadly, it was money wasted on this. The storyline is weak and boring. The writers must have known that because to cover up how boring it is they threw in hundreds of profanities. These people swear in every sentence they speak. If you're a kid, make sure you turn the volume down so mom doesn't hear it. If you're a parent, don't buy this for your kid. There are so many fantastic anime movies out there. Please don't waste your time with this one. I beg you!"
4,WOW,"Talk about fast, heavy, and screaming lyrics put together not to mention they are christian! This is great, anyone who likes heavy music will definately like Living Sacrifice. It's worht your money, and the whole album is clean."
3,Hmmnn....Somethings Missing,"Normally everything Living Sacrifice puts out is brilliant but I could never really get into this cd for some reason. I was so looking forward to its release that I even went and picked it up the day it came out. I do wish I liked it more considering its their last one, but it is just kinda lackluster to get a higher review. None of the songs really stand out that much and they sound to similar and repetitive. Its still a lot better than most of the mindless rubbish other bands throw together however it is definitely not anywhere near as incredible as their older ones such as Reborn, Inhabit, The Hammering Process, etc..."
4,Excelent Death Metal,"Call it hardcorethrashgrinddeathmetal, or what you will this album rocks. There is no let up in the raging guitars and deep roaring vocals. If you didn't know better you might think the guys of Living Sacrifice were in desperate need of counseling. The truth is they just love music infused in raw energy and that is what you get. Fans of Disturbed might not enjoy this as it is much harder and lacks the pop elements that have marked most of the so called hardcore bands you hear on mtv (played right after Brittney on TRL). The only downside is their songs tend to sound fairly similar."
5,Best Hardcore Album To Date!...,"this is one freakin' heavy Album from Living Sacrifice!! They have quite a few albums out, but this one, this one is just awesome. If you're a fan of hardcore, death metal and grindcore, THERES NO WAY YOU'RE GONNA BE DISAPOINTED!... Bruce (the lead singer for Living Sacrifice), with his low deep growls, he puts every hardcore screamer to SHAME! he is deff. an influence on me vocal-wise. If they got up there and played right before Ozzy, they'd scare everyone away with their power!Slipknot fans, BEWARE: Living Sacrifice just took things up an notch."
2,"I used to like it, but.........","To start off I'd like to say that I used to be a large fan of Living Sacrifice, when I was just getting into the metal scene. I've listened to many of their songs, cd's etc.Now the problem with this band, is that they just get boring, plain boring after a few listens, there's nothing new the next listen, especially on this album. The Hammering Process has some songs on it which I still like, but there are much better (christian) bands out there, so spend your money on a better cd if you want to do yourself a favour."
2,THIS CD ONLY HAS TWO SONGS =(,"Seriously, you've got Poisoning which is alright for the first minute and a half or so, and you've got Send Your Regrets which is amazing. Unfortunately, all the other songs sound like these two, only minus the ""alright"" and ""amazing"" bits. Which is to say it's all bigtime yawning material.I give it two stars for the two songs that I actually like to listen to.It's worth a buy if you're into your songs all sounding alike. A lot of bands do that these days, maybe it's a trend? I just don't get the appeal, I guess. =\"
1,Don't buy it!!!!!,"This CD is soooo.. boring, it never changes, all the songs are the same! they just sing the same thing over and over. and it sounds like tribal music with an electric guitar. Basicly it stinks so don't buy it, its a rip-off"
1,I hated it!,The book had too much going on for me to relate to any of the characters. I'm so tired of novels about black successful men deciding to marry white unsuccessful women. I've heard it all before. Most black men do listen to their mothers.
2,By the Numbers to be bored to death,"What kept me going was just to find out what happenedto the wife?Maybe it was because this was the most I'd seen arnold talk andI had to often back track to hear what the important dialogue was he was deliveringOr maybe it was the ""by the numbers"" action flick that made this whole durn film believable.But all in all i was not impressed or entertained."
4,So you wanna be a witness? Witness this.,"Bad acting. Cheesy story. Awful special effects. Arnold. What more could you ask for? Great cheesy action, tons of great one liners, a must have for the real appreciator of fine cinema!"
3,"Very early Arnie movie, noise,shooting, etc...","I was living in N. C. when this movie was shot. On a dare, I signed up for an extra spot. The off screen antics were much better than the on screen stuff. Somebody loaded Arnies cigar with a cigarette load, and ruined about 2 hours film time. Movie( 1- 10 ) = 4. Arnies temper with the blow up = 15. Watch behind Arnie in the casino when he says "" Tell him I'm the pain in Lemanskis' ass!"" I'm the big guy, stage right."
3,by the numbers action from his honor gov. schwarzenegger,"arnold has made some good ones and some bad ones and this one falls somewhere in between those.arnold goes undercover to bring down a mob kingpin. thats the story, nothing more nothing less. this one just can't get it's self going and is slow in some places. the gunbattles and fights are ok, but not great. still if you like arnold you may like this one"
5,raw deal,"I would highly recommend this seller because the product was just as the seller described.the movie played great,and in like new condition."
3,Vintage Schwarzenegger,"As a die-hard Schwarzenegger fan, I did not find this to be one of his best movies. But then, I don't watch them for Oscar-winning plots! There is lots of extraneous violence. Crazy car chases, and daring stunts make it great fun. The holes in the plot are barely noticeable."
4,Sci Fi,Haven't watch this yet. Should be good because most of Arnold's movies like this are usually fun to watch.
3,Early Ah-nold yarn worth checking out,"After finding sucess with Conan the Barbarian and the Terminator, Arnold Schwarzenegger starred in this half decent action yarn playing a disgraced FBI Agent called back into duty to go undercover to track a mob boss. The script, directing, action, and so forth are pretty routine for an 80's action movie, but good 'ol Arnold's magnetic charm keeps Raw Deal rolling even when it seems it's about to fall apart. The cast also includes longtime Law & Order vet Steven Hill, and most of the rest of the cast is pretty forgettable. Still worth checking out though for Arnold afficiondos who missed out on it."
5,super,"As the Chicago Mafia attempts to murder witnesses who could incriminate them in court, Mark Kaminsky, a former FBI agent (Arnold Schwarzenegger), attempts to infiltrate the organization and root out the assassins. It's time for dues to be paid ... ""Ah-nuld"" style! Kathryn Harrold, Ed Lauter, Darren McGavin and Sam Wanamaker co-star."
5,Arnold. Guns. Bad Guys. Bullets. Dead bad guys. Happy ending. That's all you need to know.,"With a movie like this, there are only a few things you need to know:1. A good (though not universal, as shown inThe 6th DayandLast Action Hero) rule of thumb is that if it stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and isn'tThe TerminatororTerminator 2 - Judgment Day(both of which are AWESOME), it's good only as a member of the ""so bad/cheesy it's good"" or ""...it's all right"" categories.2. This is one of the ""so bad/cheesy it's good"" movies. All such movies are should not be graded as you would normal films. They aren't supposed to be good. Assess them by how good they are at being cheesy, and you are being fair.3. ""You should not drink and bake."" See the movie for that one.If you like pointless action flicks (for another example, seeEraser), get this. If not, save your money."
2,Raw,"Sold entirely on the strength of being an Arnold Schwarzenegger film, 'Raw Deal' isn't actually bad, as such, it's just very dull - although, bizarrely, highbrow film critic Pauline Kael gave it an extremely good review at the time. With strange echoes of the later 'Eraser', Arnie is an FBI agent, and once you have stopped laughing and accepted this you can pay attention to the rest of the film, which is essentially a mid-80's 'war against drugs' telefilm but with more gunplay. And Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's not much fun to watch (a bit like 'Eraser' again, actually), and you'd be better off with 'Commando'."
3,The movie is a Raw Deal until the end!,"RAW DEAL is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's earlier performances, where he plays a 'cop', Kaminski. And basically, when Arnold plays a 'cop' in movies- and its an older action film, you can already tell the plot.MY REVIEW:""This elderly Arnold flick never really picks up until the end. I don't want to spoil it for you, but most of the film is boring until the action packed end! That's where the three stars come in! So fast forward those VCR/DVD players to the last fifteen minutes, and you'll be guaranteed an action packed, explosive ending sequence!""- MJV & the Movies."
2,One of Arnies worser movies,"A simple plot about an ex-FBI officer forced by an old friend to infiltrate a Mob who murdered his son.Definitley not Arnie's best but it does have the odd good scene where his driving a convertable and shooting people at the same time while listening to the Rolling Stones ""Satisfaction"" but it was really corny how his car was riddled with bullets and didn't even get a flesh wound and of course he shot everyone.There wasn't many beautiful women in it and I think I prefer the shootout scene at the end of ""Commando"" to this.But I think he played his character reasonably well."
1,"The worst Arnold Movie ever, and a terrible film overall","Let me put it this way - what are the odds two 19-year-old guys are going to walk out of a just-released Arnold Schwatzneger movie and want their money back? This is exactly how me and my best friend felt in 1986. We thought it was the most aptly named film ever.In general, a film isnt necessarily good because it has AS in it. Its usually great because it is directed by James Cameron (T1, T2, True Lies) , Ivan Reitman (Twins, Kindergarten Cop), or John Tiernan (Predator, Last Action Hero). The rest of Arnold's movies are generally video fare of varying quality, and this film specifically should be destroyed."
3,"3.5 stars: Short, clever and fun","This one is pure wish-fulfillment fantasy (but fun) -- a struggling writer and her musician-husband are saved from wage-slavery by Fluffy & PKP [note 1], their Web-savvy, entrepeneurial pets. It's a pretty slight idea to support a novel, but it's short, clever, and has a bravura finish. Recommended, especially for struggling artists.Special kudos to Ed Cox for the cover art -- do enlarge the cover scan, above!PS: when the book gets slow, you may want to skim ahead to where the cats order a pizza. Double anchovies, extra ham, no sauce.____________Note 1) --that's Princess Killer Pinknose...Happy reading--Peter D. Tillman"
1,Confusing messages,"There are HUGE distinctions and variances between satanism, new age, and occultism. By categorizing them all together, this book shows a serious lack of research and/or knowledge about these ""belief systems."" I am a child of God with a loving spiritual practice that is in NO WAY related to the devil, and I am truly offended by this umbrella of judgement. I'm amazed that every other religion and spiritual practice in the world hasn't been placed in these pages as well. What ever happened to ""love thy brother?"""
3,Nothing to Brag about.,"Got it on time and for that, I am completely thankful so, hats off to the shipper, but it's just a memory cooler."
3,Not Worth the Money or Time,"Lame storyMediocre acting because of an unfocused scriptThere are alot of other movies you should spend 2 hours with--like: ""Perfect Pitch"", or even watching TV episodes of ""justified""."
4,Great story...too much blood.,"I am almost ALWAYS a sucker for a 'based on a true story' kind of movie. And, this one did not disappoint. I just wish the director/producer hadn't thought the need for excessive blood and aggression was necessary to get the story across. I have no doubt it was historically accurate in that regard, it was a rough and tough time in America, I just didn't need to see it on the screen. I, personally, am not yet desensitized (and probably never will be) to that sort of theater and would have enjoyed the movie a little more if I hadn't been on guard to shield my eyes with a couch pillow whenever I thought an excessively bloody and hostile scene was about to play out. But, LOVED the 'story' and the actors/actresses that starred in the film. Not one I can say 'I need to see again', though."
3,Lawless movie,"Entertaining, but slow at times. The ATF character was totally unbelievable. Could have waited until it was available on Netflix"
5,This movie rocks!,"Wow! This movie is awesome. The best I seen in a while. Lawless, a must see. Make me want to read the book."
3,Very slow,Great acting and interesting time period - but the story line is SLOW. Movie starts to pick up towards the second half. It's OK.
5,Now this is a reality movie!,Great depiction of actual events in American history....we will always have a convoluted view of alcohol in this country and those in government who try ro regulate it....
2,Disappointing,The previews led me to believe that this would be a good movie. It was very drawn out and the characters weren't interesting.
4,Good Movie,This was one if the better movies we have watched lately! We would and have recommend this movie to others.
1,COULDN'T WATCH THIS MOVIE WHY ????????,"I WAS UNABLE to WATCH this MOVIE and I RENTED on FRIDAY the 1st, EXPIRES today at 5:30. SSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOO, I RENTED IT for NOTHING. There must be something WRONG SOMEWHERE cause for some reason I am having PROBLEMS watching MOVIES BUT other places that view movies work just FINE."
3,Seems real,"I believe it. Great actors playing great roles, but just didn't bite my enthusiasm. If you disagree, and you've seen it, I doubt you were raving about it the next day at work."
3,Decent movie worth a watch,Slow to start but overall a good movie worth a watch when it was on sale but couldn't recommend full price for a rental.
1,SLOW Death,NO original story line with poor actors.Movie was so slow and drawn out I almost went to sleep Southern. Accents of actors made the movie almost intolerable.
1,Heartless,It had to much violent in it. I thought it would be about them making moonshine. And selling it. But it had to much cutting and blood in it.
5,great movie,"I tend to like ""true"" stories, however this movie is very graphic. That said it is well acted, good storyline, and I really enjoyed it."
4,pretty good movie,Movie was overall good and interesting.all the actors were good and believable. The only thing that was kind of not believable was the ending with the older brother. I would most likely watch this movie again
3,moonshiners,If you have nothing to do I recommend watching this movie. Overall mediocre. Shia Lebouf character was weak. Not his best performance.
3,It was just ok,"This movie was supposedly about three brothers, but it was clear from the beginning that that the Tom Hardy character was the star and that the rest were window dressing. The only problem with that was they kept giving the window dressing too much speaking roles. Take away everyone else except Tom Hardy and replace them with better actors and presto you have a better movie. Oh, it would help if you had a somewhat more developed plot as well."
5,Good Movie,"Good actors, good direction, and Tom Hardy is excellent. I enjoy watching movies that have a true story behind it."
3,Not a block buster,I'm glad I didn't spend $30. To see this movie in the theater with my spouse.Other than that it was fine to watch on DVD.
4,Great!,"Perfect movie if you go in with no expectations.It starts strong, rolls along and then ends with a nice close and a twist."
2,wasn't great,kinda boring to be honest. I felt that it was slow and wasn't a very enjoyable movie to watch. I love the cast but they just didn't do it for me in this movie.
2,Barely two stars,"Movie was ok, kinda boring and not much of a plot. Expected alot more out of this movie . Straight up wouldent recommned."
1,Terribly Violent,This movie is so violent that it is unwatchable. I enjoy ware movies and some of my favorites are considered by others to be extremely violent so I can watch almost anything but this movie is way too much!
1,SO DAMN BAD ITS GONNA MAKE YOU WANNA DRINK RUSTY MOOONSHINE,"THIS MOVIE IS BEYOND STRAIGHT TO VIDEO!THE PLOT IS SO UNBELIEVABLE THAT IT I SAT HERE SHAKING MY HEAD . DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS CRAPPY MOVIE, IM SAVING YOU THE HOURS IVE LOST IN MY LIFE!"
1,"Hopefully-I did not buy this item, as I don't know how to watch it anyways?","I am glad to see the ""one"" can ""see"" a movie on ones computer; however, since I really do not know how to work or use or see something as a ""downloaded movie""- until I ""learn how to operate this blasted thing""; I'll just have to be ""content"" with watching the ""good-old-DVD's folks. Thanks anyways-Happy New Year to ALL of you that make the ""company"" function soo well !!!!!"
3,It was good,The movie was not bad. I'm glad I didn't see it in the theaters. The story seemed interesting. They could have been bloodier.
2,too violent,This movie would have been much better without all the horrible acts of violence depicted. I spent 1/2 the movie looking away. C'Mon!
4,good movie,"well shot, good-moving picturehas alot of action and ups and downs. Isn't the greatest film ever but definitely worth watching"
4,Awesome,This movie was awesome. It started off great right from the beginning. It's one of those movies of revenge and you love seeing them get it.
5,Great setting,Good mix of plot and random violence. Tom Hardy was brilliant. Nice to see the non gangster side of prohibition...
2,A real yawn of a movie,"I dislike movies where the best and only good parts are shown on the movie preview that you see. This was a real yawner. Not as bad as Nut Cracker ballet, but pretty darn close.If you are looking for a movie to put you to sleep, this is the one to get."
5,Great movie,"A little slow for the 1st hour, but all together an awesome movie. I would recommend this to anyone. Love!"
2,Way too much violence,"This movie went overboard on both the quantity and type of violence, we had turned it off after 30 minutes.."
3,Decent film,Film is okay. Has decent acting from all actors except Guy Pierce who gives a very good performance. As good as I expected.
5,Was a really nice movie,"I didn't understand too much the trailer, but the movie is amazing, i though that i wasn't like that movie because was a little bit slow but after 20 minutes i saw that I was wrong, it's a really good movie and I am sure that everything was for real, if you like the drama and action you should watch this movie, 10/10. I had a while without watch a movie like that, it's so nice, i love it."
4,FLAWLESS is Hardy's Performance,"I won't paraphrase the storyline as others have done here so well. I will add that the momentI hit play on the BD Player, I was so engrosed in the film I realized I was still sittingon the edge of my seat after the first 20 minutes before I made myself comfortable, and never once hit pause.I was riveted by Tom Hardy's acting, his portrayal was an original. It did not rely on a particular accent, clothing, make-up, mental defect or resemblance to a historical figure. He created an intelligent backwoods bootlegger, who despite his profession and its violence, lived by a code so strong that he appeared invincible. The glimpses of his tenderness he allowed himself were profoundly felt. The film was satisfying in its cinematography, cast, and story."
2,Lame story line,"Stellar cast, great acting and production...but someone forgot to write an interesting story to go with the great actors! Waste of time and energy."
3,Too Violent and Graphic,"The movie had a good and interesting story, but they made it too graphic and emphasized the violence too much."
2,Movie,"It wasn't a very good movie to me could have been better , prob with a different director maybe, would not recommend"
3,luke warm,"I thought this looked like a great movie, but when I finally got around to watching it, I was pretty disappointed. I had a very hard time getting in to the movie."
4,Intense,"This was a very gripping movie. You can't compare the violence in this movie to that of an ""Action"" flick. That kind of violence is almost comical in comparison. This was real, believable and gut wrenching."
3,Mildly entertaining,Not enough time spent developing characters so that the ending falls short of what was intended. Somewhat disappointing. Would not recommend to a friend
4,"pretty good, worth watching","i liked it alot, good performances all around especially from tom hardy and shia lebeuf. if you like movies from this time period, it wont disapoint"
4,Great acting - despite LaBeouf,"Apart from LaBeouf, the acting all round is great. The standout star is, once again, Tom Hardy - great, great actor. Watch it, but don't expect too much."
3,Good movie,"I liked the movie, and it displays a bit of history into America's past in dealing with moonshine. Some of the scenes might be a bit graphic for any sensitive viewers."
1,One star garbage,A friend recommended this and said it was incredible and one of the best he's seen. This movie was so freakin' bad I could not make it to the end. Completely uninteresting and extremely poor acting. I've seen better in most made for TV movies or even the Dukes of Hazzard! What the hell was this director even thinking!!?? I'm still angry about renting it on Netflix and wasting the time. I suspect my friend was drinking moonshine at the time of viewing.
1,"Boring script, bad acting, with a nice bit of scenery","This movie had a lot of promise, but it was sadly not able to reach that promise. The actors, as a group, should have been able to create a wonderful tale, but they did not work together all that well. The story should have been good, but just lagged like a dead dog in a whole raft of places. You end up with a movie that is almost work to get through. I would suggest that if you want to watch a movie from this era you watch anything else because no movie could be worse than this one."
1,Hated it,So this movie is not what I expected. I was extremely disappointed. The actor did great. It was just a poorly done movie in my opinion.
1,Very dissapointed,I was never able to get this video to finish loading. Highly considering switching to Apple products! Very very dissapointed.
2,Violent,Unusually raw and violent. The characters and performances do not stand out. Guy Pearce is the exception. Not for the faint of heart.
1,did not download properly,This did not download properly. Had to try it a second time. Would appear we were charged for that.That should not happen.
4,Movie Buff,"I decided to purchase this dvd because it was based on a true story. I also wanted to see how the role of Shia Labeouf would play out, from playing the role in The Transformers. He did good. It was a long movie, but it had a good plot. The togetherness of the brothers sticking with each other and not going with the corrupted bad guys. I would recommend it to purchase."
4,Really good movie...great acting!,I wasn't sure about this movie at first because it didn't seem like it would be something I was really in to but I really ended up loving it
2,A Movie that Doesn't Know What it Wants to Be,"As a period action/outlaw film, this could have been 4 stars - driven largely by the performances of Tom Hardy and Guy Pearce.Unfortunately, the screenwriters who adapted the book found it necessary to include two love stories into the thing, which added nothing to the plot and exerted a profound drag upon the pacing of the film. I guess the film makers felt obliged to do this in order to create a ""date movie"" for female audiences, but they spent so much time on the romantic subplots that the action heart of the film got lost.The really interesting love story here was the love of Guy Pearce's character for himself. What a terrific, risk-taking, under-appreciated actor he is."
5,Not fast paced but still a great movie,I first saw this movie on Amazon Instant Video that I downloaded. I am glad I took the chance on watching this movie. It is not a fast paced movie but the era the movie is portraying is not a fast paced time or area. It did show you what bootleggers went through during the Depression to sell moonshine and the dangers they faced.I love movies when someone is cocky and thinks they are going to come some where and make things right and they are put in their place. That happens in this movie. I can not tell any more because it would give away part of the movie.I love the music in this movie. Music with fiddles played in the down South fashion in the Depression era is a favorite of mine. This movie is a must see if you like true stories about had desperate people were to make a living in the Depression. I plan on watching it again.
2,Mehhh...,"A buddy of mine raved about this movie. I watched it and was disappointed. Great actors and decent plot but the movie developed very slow. The climactic scenes were short. Basically, it could have been way better given the subject matter and actors."
1,Disgusting,"Unless you relish Lawlessess, don't polute your mind with this one. Was hoping for some edgy, period drama. Movie managed to capture a ""mood,"" but no interesting plot, even less substance. Belabored ugliness, intensely overacted."
1,Two Hours I'll never get back,"This movie was mostly plotless. Who were you supposed to root for in this movie? The taciturn hillbilly moonshiners, or the corrupt police? They attempt to make that choice easy for you by making the rep for the commonwealth attorney's office into a villian straight out of a comic book or typecasting 101. It would be hilarious if it weren't so obvious. There were really no likeable characters to feel any sympathy for. Yeah, I know moonshine is big again these days for some unknown reason, but this attempt to cash in on the craze really falls flat. Not enough action, poorly paced, and half the cast mumbling all their lines. Save your money. Once again I decided to take a chance on the oxymoron ""Action movie --Starring Shia LaBeouf"", and once again it was a total stinker. Don't rent this piece of crap. How they talked all the decent cast members into starring in this is beyond me."
1,Wife and Daughter walked out on it.,"We like Shia LaBoeuf, but every scene was mega violence with little in between. Not much of a story. We didn't finish it."
1,languish not lawless,This was a terrible movie that went nowhere fast.The only thing lawless was the fact that people paid good money to see it.
4,good movie but short on action.,Movie is pretty good but is over sold on trailers as an action film; is great to watch just a little short on action .it will keep you watching to the end. Good film
5,No one famous in this movie but it's awesome!,Great action and storyline. There is no one famous who plays in this movie but don't let this sway your decision to watch.
4,Good movie.,Enjoyed watching this movie. It was a big unrealistic but since it was based on a true story but also legend it worked.
3,Good movie,Good Movie. Would have preferred more action scenes and less drama but to each his own. You will enjoy it.
3,Not bad.,"Not a fantastic movie, but the acting was quite good and the historical aspects were interesting but could have been elaborated more and integrated into the storyline. The villain was fairly one-dimensional, and could have been developed further."
3,"Tom Hardy rules as the tough, sullen head of the Bonndurant clan",Tom Hardy is badass in this turn as Forrest Bondurant. Otherwise a fairly predictable prohibition story. Shia Lebeuf is ho hum. Guy Pearce is punching the clock.
3,Decent - lacking cohesive story,Cast and crew is awesome but I was a bit whelmed by the story line. Ending was a bit disappointing.
4,In spite of Shia Labeouf this was alright,"I am not a bit fan of Shia Labeouf, but I do like the other two supporting actors in this movie. It was worth a rental."
5,awesome,great movie from beginning to end. A bit cheesy in that people get shot a couple times and live.....but overall great. Makes me want to go watch some moonshiners.
2,Didn't think too much of it.,"this movie was ok but not that great, for one what people said about the violence is true, it's like ""hostel"" type violence in an old setting a bit too gruesome like ok we get the point. And secondly the storyline moved very fast, i pretty much seen almost everything in the previews in the first half hour of the movie, some of the acting was good, but a lot seemed bad, i didn't like the guy forest's acting much, seemed kind of wierd. Not a movie i'd rent or watch again really."
4,DVD,"I loved this movie. I was skeptical at first of the storyline, but it's based on a true story and it definitely was worth watching. I would recommend."
2,Difficult to understand dialogue,"The story was ok, but I couldn't understand the dialogue. I'm not sure if it was due to the accents or low gruff voices, but I could only follow about half the dialogue."
3,Just wait untill you get it free.,"The movie was not what I expected, but is base in a real event so is what it is.No a good action movie."
2,Lawless,Our son said we should see this movie. We were not impressed with this movie. It was very slow. Would not recommend it.
4,Violent,"The movie itself was good but I thought it was very violent and bloody, I spent a lot of time closing by eyes. If you don't like extreme bloody scenes this is not the movie for you!"
4,recommend,"quite a bit of violence, however enjoyed and realistic story from that era and anything Shia LaBeouf is in is worth a watch!"
3,Average violent,"Compared to today's violence, zombie, blood dripping movies, this movie may be mild. Although showing the cutting of ones throat doesn't make it mild for me. It says it's 'based on a true story'. We have no way to know what that story is. Or what's true about this one. The movie tries to rationalize it by showing an alleged picture of the real characters at the end of the move.I thought one scene was funny however, where they pour the moonshine into the gas tank and the truck runs!Wouldn't watch it twice..."
3,Just ok. Not well edited.,Should expect more from the writing and editing. Acting is fine but so many loose ends and improper use of quality actors.
4,Great movie - but graphic!,"We watched ""Lawless"" because of the actors that are in it. Tom Hardy, Shia LeBeouf, Guy Pierce, and Jessica Chastain. And we weren't disappointed! The movie kept a great pace throughout and held our interest. The ensemble cast worked really well together. The only thing I will say is that there are a few graphic scenes in the movie, so if you're a little squeamish about those tyoe of things, be prepared to close your eyes a couple of times."
4,Good,I liked it. Probably not worth owning unless you're a hillbilly who gets drunk off moonshine all the time and loves resisting law enforcement. Lol. Worth watching once but that's about it.
4,Lawless,I odrered this movie based on the tv ad it was good but not what I thought it would be like.
4,Great movie,"I'm not a huge Shia LaBeouf fan, but really enjoyed this movie. Actually, watched it a couple of times. Would recommend."
5,Fantastic...,I was very surprised at how good this movie was..it gets a bit brutal but that's ok by me..great acting and a great story line..
2,Disappointing,"I expected more from this movie, but was specially disappointed by Tom Hardy's performance. Not sure what he was trying to accomplish but he barely said a word during the entire movie and when he did, he mumbled. Shia Lebouf didn't do much better either and didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the characters. As for Jessica Chastein, she stuck out like a sore thumb."
2,thumbs down,"The plot is disjointed. There is gratuitous violence with zero physical consequences. I mean, a guy gets his throat slit and then walks to the hospital, while his gf gets brutally raped only to show up in the next scene with perfectly coifed hair in an immaculately dry-cleaned blouse, and all of this is in 1930s rural Virginia. And the DA is supposed to be a NAZI I guess. Watch something else with your time."
3,Just Okay,I like all of the actors movie just didnt do it for me it was just okay. woud have given it 2 and a half stars
5,FANTASTIC!,This is one of my favorite movies. Tom Hardy and Jessica Chastain were fabulous together. Tom should get an Oscar for his performance. Only wish some of the scenes were lit better.
2,would not recommend,"I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, the previews were great! Unfortunately, the previews were the best parts of the entire movie. The movie skipped around a lot and was very violent and yet boring to me."
3,Okay,"I kept hoping for something awesome to happen, but the big scenes never came. It was just decent. Good acting all around, but the plot just lacked for me."
2,SHOULD BE OUTLAWED,"Sure wish I had read the reviews before I wasted a couple of hours of my life watching this one. It was a great idea gone undeveloped. Good for the first 15 minutes or so, then it's all south from there. Don't waste your time."
4,Tom Hardy,"Jessica Chastain is amazingly talented in everything that I've seen her in, but its Tom Hardy in this movie that completely makes it worth watching. It has a great cast and definitely keeps you entertained."
3,"Watch the trailer, its the best part.",was really looking forward to this movie. Had to buy it the day it came out. sad to say that the trailer is the best part.
3,Great idea. Poor execution.,Was excited to see this movie and thought the cast would be great. The plot drags on in too many places and generally goes no where. Soundtrack is excellent.
3,!. Almost Docu-drama..Almost a Ficti-Drama. Not enough of Either. 2. Glorified Wrong Characters in our history.,"A True chapter in American Cultrural History; however how did this chapter influnence local and national perspective of both, law enforcement power-centrist' , and the empoverished whose chose that route of illegalendeavors to survive. Look at 1920's-1960's then 2012. We once again or, still, have corrupt law enforcement, Govt. and Gangsters in the streets runing wild.During the 1920's through the 1960's there was a groundswell of National Pride and strife among the masses,to become A Productive, Patriotic & Proud, Presence in the World. We almost all, wanted to be CITIZENS. IT re-surged after Prohibition. Now Look who we are as a people. Just a thought about the puzzleing absence of an academy worthy epilog, to what could have been a societal, ""paradigm shifting"" classic film, to all sub-cultures here in America."
5,Real Good Movie,"Watched by chance.The story and action are great. Dicovered Tom Hardy.Outstanding. I will probably buy this and ""Warrior"". Both ""must see flicls!"
3,Kills time,Good to kill time. Hated raising volume for scenes when they whisper then seconds later I felt I was going through an apocalypse.
4,I have been waiting,I was waiting for this movie to come out to rent. Even with the anticipation Lawless did not disappoint. The plot and acting was pretty good but I was waiting for Shia LaBeouf to become a bad*** and take over the movie. He never completely fulfilled that roll and I was a little disappointed. Still a great rental.
2,Didn't like it much.,About the only thing really enjoyable for me in this movie was the setting. Otherwise it didn't appeal to me very much. Lots of mumbling and far fetched story lines.
2,A real snoozer,The story was not very entertaining. It was slow moving. I think that the storyline could have been portrayed in a more interesting way.
2,Not as good as the previews was,From the previews the movie looked pretty good. As the movie was based on a trure story. Turned out just ok as most nonfiction books that are turned into a movie
5,Great movie,"This movie is really a good movie to watch if you like boot leggin, and prohibition, plus it also has gun fights fast cars and great actors! EXCELLANT"
4,Good story,"Good story but a bit unrealistic. My wife thought it was too violent, she didn't finish watching it. There was unnecessary nudity."
4,Gnarly,Loved the movie twas great! Highly recommend it. Go! Buy It! Rent It! Do it NOW!!! I said NOOOOOWWW¡! Thanks
4,Great movie and storyline,LaBeouf does a great job in this movie. I live in VA so the story equally interesting. Good movie choice
2,Diappointing!,"Waslooking forward to a great action flick,instead got a movie that was slow and pretty boring.Would not recommend this movie to anyone."
5,Best Movie of 2012,"Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf did a fabulous job in this moving. Loved the storyline, acting, casting and set. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
2,A gift,"My grandson requested this on his Amazon wish list so I bought it for him. We rented the movie and watched it later. I thought it was violent and depressing, but the rest of the family really likes it."
4,LAWLESS,LAWLESS. Good action movie. Great story. This movie also is also educational. We enjoyed watching the movie during the blizzard.
4,Hardy and LaBeouf Stars,"These are actors that I will continue to look at in whatever movie they star in. The shy country boy turned into a ruthless vengeful killer by his older brother is powerfully portrayed by LaBeouf. Hardy as the cold blooded killer defending his family and his means of support is focused solely on his mere presence, but his dialogue makes you like this dark figure he portrays almost as if he is a piece of Hardy's true nature."
2,Lawless,"This movie gave one a historical perception of the Prohibition period of American History; however, the portrayal of the characters and the story line seemed superficial and shallow. SMS"
3,Excellent cast.,"The movie could have been better. Based off of, or rather inspired by real brothers, the movie lacks a little something extra. A great cast, big Tom Hardy fan although Guy Pierce steals the show. The movie definitely keeps your interest, but at times it seems like the story has been done a few times before. Some more depth in the story could've helped it some.This movie is for anyone who is into those old time, good ole boy, action packed movies, this is for you.3 stars for a good movie that could've used just a little more."
4,Highly underrated movie,"This movie is fantastic and underrated in my opinion. The characters, especially Forest, really capture the spirit of American bootleggers during the early 20th century."
3,Make Our Heroes - Heroes,Could’ve been an excellent movie just kept waiting on the action…all the way to the end. No one ever touch charge.
3,just didnt think it was that good,Just didnt think it was that good. It was ok but seemed to be missing something. Would not recommend to buy would watch for free.
5,Great Movie,This movie definitely has some insane violence so not one for children. My husband and I watched together late at night.
5,really good,I loved this movie and since its a true story made it even better.It has some history in it.I thought Tom Hardy was great!!!
4,lawless,really liked this movie it didnt get good reviews when it came out so i didnt see it in the theaters. romance and blood and guts bad good u want to kill yourself and good guys and gals to root for.
4,Moviegoer,"This is an excellent movie! Great ensemble cast & well directed! Some graphic violence & sexual content, therefore should be watched by adults only!"
4,Good movie.,"I am surprised I did not see it in theaters. It helps that it is historically based. Some parts stretched the imagination a bit, but who's to say? There was a lot that went on in that region during the 20's and 30's that we probably would not believe today."
4,Popcorn anyone?,I'm not a critic so I'm not going to judge the movie Lawless other than to say that I like it.
5,FANTASTIC Movie,This is a great movie with great actors! This is a great quality movie. It is definitely well worth the money. The seller made sure the item was processed and shipped very quickly!
4,A pretty good movie,"The acting is great and the story line well done. I'm a little squimish with violence and this movie had that, but not overwhelmingingly."
2,Just OK,The movie was OK but there was not much plot line. I found myself with questions afterwards. Probably worth the $4 I paid.
3,Starts kind of slow,"It's a weak storyline but there is some decent acting, I was able to get through it. Guy and Shia make it worthwhile if you have nothing better to do."
2,Not that good,"Didn't really go anywhere, characters weren't interesting, Shia LeBeouoef's character was a huge moron, Tom Hardy looked unmotivated. Lame film."
3,Much ado about not much,"All the elements of a good film are scattered in there, but they just don't come together very well. The movie ends up a bit disconnected and rather anti-climactic."
4,Lawless,Great scope. Strong plot. Well developed characters.The story took you where you hoped it would go.Very well done
2,Lawless DVD,DVD has some sound problems and static not very good quality. So please advise others. Music hard to hear. Film not very well seen.
3,Moonshiners,"Movie has a great cast, however, the script could have been better for the actors. Did not fulfill their potential as a whole. Guy Pearce had the best role as the antagonist in the story. Period piece was valuable to highlight the moonshine stills during Prohibition and how everyone from the gangsters to local law enforcement were fighting for a piece of the action."
4,WELL DONE,Worth seeing. Don't know how the lead character in this survived so many traumatic incidents and still lived for many more years.
2,What a boring mess,"So the basic elements of story, actors, cinematography, etc.. are all here, but the pace and flow of the scene sequences are so messed up this becomes a long boring mess."
3,Ho Hum,"For a true story it leaves you wondering...Really??People get hurt, people die, nothing happens. Stills are smashed and closed everywhere except for one place. Everyone seems to know where it is except the crooked cop.I was disappointed."
4,good movie,Watched on the app for the Wii. Over G wifi. Rebuffered twice during the movie. Good picture though. Enjoyed the movie.
3,its okay,Just like the title says. Good movie but nothing ground breaking. Wait till it comes out on On Demand and save the money for something else.
2,Interesting story since it's based upon some truth but...,Did they really need to make it this violent? If you are into blood and guts then this is your movie. I didn't expect this much from the preview. I would have liked to see some more facts about actual history during prohibition rather than a bunch of greedy men do horrible things to each other.
2,Not a good movie,"1. poor character development (especially between Forrest and the woman who left Chicago). Also - why was the new deputy so cruel? Again, poor character development.2. several scenes filmed without accompanying light; had to listen to what was going on instead of viewing during several scenes. Would be fine if the darkness lended to the movie, however, it seemed it was a cheaper way of filming this movie.3. really great cast - that's the reason for 2 stars.4. overall disappointing and felt like a waste of time... : ("
4,Great,Enjoyed it but some parts are tough to watch. You really get a sense of how tough and dangerous times could be. Title says it all!
5,Lawless,"This was an absolutely great movie that truely enjoyed. Not big on movies but really liked this one. I thought the acting was spectacular and I truely enjoyed the soundt track! In fact I bought the sound track too. However, I do not believe this movie is for children or folks who have a problem with realistic violence."
5,Pretty awesome movie,"I hadn't seen this film before purchasing it, but I'm definitely glad I got it. My husband & I watched it the other night & we both agreed that it's probably one of the best movies we have seen in quite a while. Excellent story line & the actors are phenomenal. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good story & good acting."
2,Lawless or Hopeless?,"This film wanders through the hill country during prohibition. What should be prohibitedis making movies that look like they have a possibility and then never deliver. Don't drinkthis moonshine, it will make you go blind!"
3,Decent movie; interesting localized story of Prohibition Era Violence,"(If I could, it'd be a 3 1/2 out of 5 stars). I liked the history and feel of this period drama, but some of the scenes are a bit stilted and drawn out to the point of awkwardness. Overall, I enjoyed it though, and the only complaint I have is that it was a little difficult to understand the dialogue in a few instances. It could be the Aussie accents combined with the actor's mumbling portrayal of the character. And, due to it being a download, I didn't have CC to help me out?!! (Wish the FCC would make CC mandatory with all downloads just like Network programming - available with each and every movie we rent or purchase)!PS- I doubt your younger children should see or would even enjoy this movie?! Some of the violence is very graphic."
5,Lawless,Awesome! Perfect movie for guys and girls! Lots of action and even some funny parts!! The ending was unpredictable. love me some Shia
4,Pretty good,"Tom hardy was like bane without the mask. Shy lebuff, all i see is him in his Disney days. Or i expected is model T to transform in to a laser wielding robot. Guy peirce gave a weak and disappointing performance. If you are watching Discoveries Moonshiners this is sorta interesting.It was a good movie overall, I recommend ya rent it."
2,Ammiture,"I lost interest really quickly, I think LaBeouf was a poor choice for the part (southerner). I would have left in the theater."
2,Book Has Better Character Development,"My opinion may be clouded by our terrible streaming experience that day, but I thought the movie was very dark. I have read the book and felt the movie did not provide the character motivation developed in the book."
4,Entertaining and well acted.,"This was a great movie. I really enjoyed the plot and the acting. The cinematography could have told it's own story. It was gruesome, but real."
5,Excellent movie a must see,"Well made, great group actors and characters; set design for time period well detailed and breath taking.... a must see"
3,It was okay,"This movie was okay. The storyline was a bit slow. Overall, it was good. I think it just wasn't my type of movie. The actors did a good job!"
4,Entertaining,This movie is more like a 3 1/2 stars but worth the watch if you have most of the other new releases.
4,Historic and Timeless,"Very good on the historical aspects, you can just tell that they were from a HollyWood stand point. All of the actors and actresses were amazing"
4,Must see.,Great story and lots of action. I wasn't expecting it to be a great movie because Shia LaBeouf was in it but it was indeed a great movie.
3,Okay,"Movie was full of action and information on southern roots. Although the movie is based off of a book, the plot did not fully develop the characters. Felt like there were parts missing even though the film was fairly lengthy."
4,Best Shia so far,really well done film on all levels fthe ensemble cast works well together and you can feel the insanity of Guy Pearse.The cinematography and direction all deserve kudos for a job well done.
4,Loved it!!!,"If you are looking for good story telling, a villain you love to hate, a knight in shining armor you love to love, a group of underdogs you can't help pulling for this is the movie for you -- there is some gratuitous but expected violence to boot."
4,Lawless,"Great story, completly entertaining and edge of seat drama. Great movie feed thru PS3 system. very satisfied. Would reccomend to friends."
4,Heavy show!!,Very violent and graphic. Probably closer to being accurate depicting those troubled times in history. The actors are fabulous and perfict for their parts. A great film but not for children!!
2,Predictable and pointless,"I'm still trying to figure out the reason all of these actors signed up for this film. Beyond representing the point of view of a working-class kid trying to make a living as a bootlegger, nothing fresh or provocative about the Prohibition Period was explored here. And most of the characters were very one-dimensional (good, bad, naive, etc.)."
4,Unique movie,"I loved this movie. It is quite different from most movies done about this era. It is not Boardwalk Empire. The fact that it was based on real lives made it a hit. The actors were all excellent, and it did not disappoint me. This is a movie I will watch again and share with my friends"
1,a real snooze.,"Didn't care what happened. The ultimate kiss of death for a movie, boredom. they used a lot of devices in this movie borrowed from other places, but all in all, a true snoozefest, punctuated by bats of extreme graphic violence. honestly this was unique because i'm not sure i cared who won. i was rooting for them all to be killed so they could roll credits. harsh i know. too slow. etc."
1,This went no where,Boring movie with gratuitous violence and characters who you never cared about. Don't waste your time with this one tonight
1,this movie moved at a glacier's pace!!!,can i get some subtitles? damn! people need to enunciate! and what abt the gratuitous nude seen by jessica chastain? predicable!! it took all my strength to watch this movie til the end. what is seen cannot be unseen. lawd hav mercy.
1,"Aimless, pointless and violent",The actors speech was hard to understand because of the use of heavy local accents. The story itself seemed was uninteresting but there was lots of killing.
1,so terribly boring...terrible characters...lines...plot...nothing special here at all.,"sorry but i just could not get into this sorry excuse for a movie, so boring, slow, and unnecessary. shai why??????"
1,Don't waste your time with this movie,"Trying to ride on the curtails of HBO's Boardwalk Empire fame by making a movie about Prohibition and bootleggers. This movie lacks character development, story line development, insight and explanations, and a plot. Well, it has a plot, several actually, neither one gets focus and the movie jumps all over the place. Poorly written movie, hard to follow and quite boring. Don't waste your time."
1,Terrible,BORING!!!!! Fell asleep halfway through. Terrible movie from the beginning. Do not recommend it at all! Waisting your time watching this.
2,Lawless was a lousy movie,Lawless------ Very slow moving. Basically poor acting. The main character had no personality at all very bland. Definitely not a first rate movie. A very dark movie.
3,Without captions I missed half the movie !,They whisper so much even with the sound up maximum I wasn't able to hear or understand half the movie.I am hard of hearing and since I'm moving and already packed my hearing aides this movie is unknown to me.I really wish amazon would have the caption available on rental downloads for people like myself who really need them.
4,Enjoyable Movie,"I enjoyed this movie, it kept me interested with a combination of action and an interesting story. Based on a real story of a set of brothers with quality acting."
3,Lawless,Could have developed the characters better. Didn't understand the role of the attorney general. Could have made the Chicago cop more active in his role of a bad guy
5,Great movie,It met expectations and really enjoyed this movie. Action packed the whole time and didn't seem to drag at all.
4,One of the better movies I've seen about hillbillies and moonshine,"This was a good movie. It kept my attention but I feel like it never really hit its climax. There were events that happened and I would think ""this is going to get wild"" then it wouldn't get to exciting. But I really liked it. Tom Hardy and Shia LaBeouf you can't go wrong."
5,Childhood captured!,I was hoping to find a new copy of this book. My mom bought it at a Library sale when I was a little girl and it has been well read by all of her 6 children and now her grandchildren. My 3 year old reads it at least 3x a day. It depicts childhood exactly how it should be for all children- full of imagination and potential. All time favorite childrens book. Glad ours is still readable just wish I could find a newer one at an affordable price.
5,Exactly what I ordered!,Product was purchased as a gift and it was exactly what I ordered. It arrived sooner than expected too.Thank you.
2,"OK, but rabbit ears are better","Purchased this unit (mounted indoors) because I got tired of adjusting rabbit ears (I refuse to pay $50/month for cable). Unfortunately the reception quality is mediocre, if not subpar for its price. I get cleaner pictures with my old amplified rabbit ear set."
1,A poor performer...,"I bought Terk TV55 for my RCA F38310, an HDTV. Considering the price, I thought it would be one of the best in the market, but to my surprise, the signal reception was EXTREMELY poor. So I returned the unit and purchased Winegard HD-7080, an outdoor antenna, instead. This HD-7080's been performing well so far, enabling me to receive all the ""picture perfect"" HD signals from local stations (*CBS, NBC, ABC, KCET, etc) in the greater Los Angeles area. If you're looking for a reliable HDTV antenna for over-the-air HD signals, pass Terk TV55 and consider either Winegard or Channel Master. (A side note: Preamps manufactured by Winegard or Channel Master will greatly improve the overall reception. I have Winegard AP8275 to compliment my HD-7080, and these units give me the clearest picture imaginable!)"
1,Makes no Difference,"I connected the antenna to my Mitsubishi with an integrated HD tuner and could not receive stations with any consistency. I mounted the antenna in several locations, indoor and out, including on a mast on my roof and reception never improved. I purchased a cheaper conventional outdoor antenna and reception is perfect. I live approximately 25 miles north from the towers in Dallas. Very disappointing for the price."
2,TERK 55,"I had almost no luck with this antenna. It was only slightly more powerful than my 20 year old ""Rabbit Ears"". I ended up buying the cheapest outdoor antenna locally from Lowe's. It's the $35.00 Channel Master. I placed it in the same spot in the attic, and get much higher signal strength on every channel but one. I actually get a channel that I couldn't get at all with the Turk. Signal strength is much more stable with the Channel Master as well... Pete"
1,Their other (cheaper) unit is better,I bought this unit because I have another product from the same company -- the TV5 amplified indoor antenna -- and I was very happy with that unit but wanted better performance. I didn't get it. The more expensive item is much worse. Save your money.
4,Terk TV-55/vhf/hdtv /in-outdoor amp.,The antenna amplifier work great even in indoor where I am using it right now at downtown San Francisco. I live in a 6 storey building and I am onthe fourth floor surrounded by tall building around and was able to pullin about 14 clear on air HDTV channel.
4,HD ant. TV,It is good than I am expected.Save money for me over satalite disk or cable TV . My TV now can get most of the local chanel
2,Definately not worth the price paid,"I am so dissapointed by this product! I used to have a cheap antenna that would get me two channels with decent picture and that's it. I wanted to get all the broadcast channels, and according to the box I could get better with this antenna. While it's true I do get more channels, they come in horribly- and the two channels that I did get with the old antenna well, they come in worse now. I live in San Jose, and all the transmitters are on hills and we live in a valley, so mountains and hills shouldn't be an issue. I will be packing this antenna up and taking it back. I STRONGLY recommend you do not purchase this antenna. It's definately not worth the cost."
2,Failed after 6 months,"I purchased the antenna 6 months ago and had great difficulty positioning it for the best reception. I finally settled on a outdoor site under the eave, however, reception was only fair.After six months the antenna stopped receiving HD signals."
1,Very poor antenna,"Despite all the bad reviews I bought this antenna because I have an older bigger TERK that works great. BIG MISTAKE!! I do not understand the good reviews unless they are plants, because this antenna is completely useless for VHF and makes no difference over ordinary rabbit ears for UHF (its actually dramamtically worse). I am not kidding or exaggerating when I say the bare antenna wire got better reception. Sticking my tongue on to the end of the antenna cable and using my body as an antenna was better for all channels than the TERK TV 55 (though not nearly as good as the rabbit ears). By the way, I used the very best antenna cable from monster cable. Beware. You will regret buying this antenna."
2,Don't do it,"I bought a couple of cheap rabbit ears type antennas for TVs in each of the guest rooms and bought the TV-55 as an over the air antenna for a new LCD in the master bedroom. After trying all combination of TVs and antennas, this is by far the worst performer. I am in Fairfax County outside of Washington DC and only 15 or so miles from the broadcast towers, but this antenna has trouble picking up more than 1 of the 3 network broadcasts in the area. Save your money and look for something else."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY !!!!!!!!!!!!!,SPENT MORE TIME MOVING IT TO DIFFERENT LOCATIONS THAN WATCHING T.V. ITS A JOKE !
2,Don't waste your money,"It is no better than a $25 set of rabbit ears from WalMart. I live close to TV stations and all in same direction, yet it only picks up 3 of 6.Even mounted outdoors it sucks. Indoors even worse.If you plan to get good signeal, get a good outdoor and don't even think about this as an indoor unit."
2,"Overpriced product, mediocre performance","If you are in a bad reception area, most off-the-shelf antennas won't help much. Terk TV-55 is is not an exception. I bought it believing the manufacturer's sweet techno jargon description, hoping it would improve my reception. It did not. Tried many antennas before and this one doesn't stick out with anything except the price.I recently bought the small Zenith ZHDTV1 HDTV-UHF Digital Indoor Antenna and it works much better than this one.This antenna is not worth the high price with this quality of reception."
1,Your paying for that cool plastic case.,"This antenna is not so bad, it just cost twice what a good antenna cost. I actually got better reception on some stations with a cheep set of rabit ears. This antenna might work great for VHF, but I bought it for HDTV on UHF. Your 99 bucks gets you a very pretty antenna that works as well as some 25 dollar antennas. IF your location gives you great UHF reception, then a cheap set of rabbit ears is all you need. If your locations gives you poor UHF reception, the TERK TV55 won't help. Even with the high price, you still won't get better than light green reception (as measured on antennaweb.org). Save your money, or try a cheaper antenna first."
4,Works well but sensitive,"This antenna works well after I got it properly installed. The antenna is very sensitive to location and orientation, need to try diferent positions until getting the right one. Indoors, it is about the same as amplified rabbit ears but outdoors worked much better. Also need to use RG-6 cable for the lead-in, not the the cheaper RG-59. Reception was bad with 50 feet of the cheap lead-in but greatly improved with the better cable."
1,Be warned!,"Like other reviewers, found this was a bad antenna. Signal strength was 2 notches above weak. Much happier with the Radio Shack 15-1880 amplified HDTV antenna. That was half the price!"
3,spotty at best,I bought this to replace our amplified rabbit ears. It didn't help. I expected to have to mount it in the attic to get a higher reception plane. I tried several locations with little improvement. the one spot it worked was when it was laying loosely ontop of some boxes while choosing the next place (my wife was scanning channels at the time). Obviously I could not secure it there. Moving it a few inches destroyed the reception. I finally bought a RCA ANT 3022 indoor/outdoor non amplified antenna and installed it in the attic. it worked well and even better when I purchased an inline amp. All this was cheaper than the $100 the Terk 55 cost. If you have space I'd try a traditional antenna like you grew up with.
1,A expensive piece of junk! - 0 stars!,"I am 5 miles from the HDTV tower in Baltimore (3 stations) - I can see the tower from my window. This piece of junk, even when mounted outside, could not hold on to the signals. A coat hanger did a better job. Found a great (and cheap) indoor HDTV antenna on ... Brings in all 3 HDTV stations perfectly."
1,This product is pathetic.,This is a terrible antenna. I can't believe how much better reception mere bunny ears obtain. They should have been paid not to make this hunk of garbage.
3,"OK for UHF, forget VHF","I had one of these for many years. It served me well prior to the digital transition, however my local CBS affiliate flipped over to VHF and this antenna delivered 0 signal. This was very surprising since it is supposed to be UHF/VHF. I finally broke down and put a Channel Master passive antenna in the attic to replace it and get substantially better signal on all channels. I don't recommend this unit."
1,Strongly advise against,"Performance is horrible for HDTV; at best, picks up half of channels; very frustrating to use; it's collecting dust right now. For a fraction of the Terk's cost, currently using a large unamplified outdoor antenna mounted in the attic which picks up all of the HDTV channels in my area; PBS has intermittent audio hiccups; all other channels seem fine. Might want to check out the reviews on ""Gemini ZHDTV1 HDTV-UHF Digital Indoor Antenna"" on this site as an alternative if you cannot use a large outdoor antenna. Good luck :)"
2,OK but not great.,This has been a bit disappointing in regard to the signal quality I get for my Home Theater PC. I got nearly the same signal strength from the free antenna that came with my tuner card.
3,TERK Indoor / Outdoor Antennae,"In the attic, it works fairly well. Using my VCR as a tuner, all stations come in fairly well, except for WADL in Detroit and FOX. Connecting it directly to my TV, the reception wasn't good. Just putting the Antennae in the TV Room itself, the reception was no good with either device. I haven't tried it outside on the roof or under the eaves yet. Unplanned costs included buying a RG6 cable, 30 feet long, $30."
3,TV Antenna,"This antenna is supposed to be for UHF-VHF. I purchased it as it was supposed to bring in stations from 50 miles away. Unfortunately, I had to reinstall the old antenna and rotor as it did not have as good reception than the ""rabbit ears"" on a 30 year old TV.Most stations wee very fuzzy and could not be watched.May be OK if you live close to brocast sites, but, mid range traditional antenna works better for us."
3,Cotton Lycra Bike Short - royal blue- medium,"Well suited to the gym: not tight or clingly, but not loose either.Doubt I shall use them as bike shorts - no crotch padding; it would be like cycling nude!Some of the seam threads are dangling; this may just be left-over from the sewing process.Good value for money, but the brokerage charges at the border were rediculous: $18. I will think again before making a small value order (<$100)"
2,Better choices,"I ordered medium. Way too big for mediums. Thigh length is too short. Material is not the best. Also, they charghe s/h for each item you order. Ridicculus. Maybe, might make good winter underwear. Would not order these again."
3,I cant wear these in public,"It like underwear, I am very disappointed, i thought these would be great to bike or work out in and they are just very expensive boxer briefs. sorry I wish i never bought them"
5,Great Gift!,"I have purchased this title twice as a gift and been thanked profusely. If you have a friend or relative who appreciates positive messages, could use daily motivation, needs help to focus on inspirational thoughts, or who works in a stressful job, this is an excellent gift for African-Americans and people of any race or gender."
2,Does not work well in 3/4 inch plywood.,"I've been using this blade in a new Bosch CS5 to cut ""across"" 23/32 inch cabinet grade plywood. The cuts are 15 1/2 inches long. The blade causes considerable burning. Often it is not possible to complete the cut. About 10 to 12 inches into the cut the blade binds, the saw kicksback and even the powerful Bosch motor can't turn the blade. I've had to stop the cut and wedge a screwdriver blade in the cut behind the saw as a makeshift kerf spreader. I think the problem is that the blade has almost no set and so is very susceptible to binding. Using masking tape on the top of the cut line, and wedging with a screwdriver, I have been able to get some very fine cuts, but it's a lot of work and I've not had these problems with other brand's 150 tooth blades."
2,"Long, disgusting and boring...","this movie is about the opposite of Run Lola Run. It features not only some of the worst, most amatuer attempts at symbolism you will ever see, but also a very disgusting tracheotomy scene, a kid eating glass and so much more (maybe even incest!) all done rather realistically. Really, this movie repulses me. I wanted to like it, but... I give it 2 stars (instead of 1) only because it at least tried to be interesting (though it fails miserably) and even that is something compared to most American movies."
2,Worth a look for the curious,"Another movie from the director and star of the cult hit RUN LOLA RUN . Franka Portente plays Sissi, a nurse who is injured in a car accident but is saved by a criminal who, in a gruesome scene performs an emergency tracheotomy on her with a Swiss Army knife and a drinking straw. After her recovery Sissi sets out to find him and thank him for saving her life, but she discovers he doesn't want to know her. However little do they know their paths will cross again in a bank robbery.Despite sounding interesting PRINCESS AND THE WARRIOR is absorbing only in fits and starts and is mostly dull and overlong to boot. Director Tom Tykwer again makes full use of elaborate camerawork, but this only helps up to a certain point. That said, the movie is still worth a look, if only for curiosity's sake."
4,The Princess and the Warrior,"According to DVDempire.com, the DVD region 1 release of ""The Princess and the Warrior"" will include deleted scenes, a ""making of"" featurette, director and cast commentaries, and ""much more.""I am really looking forward to the release of this DVD the film is wonderful and it'll be great to hear Tykwer and Potente discuss their 2nd collaboration. Hopefully all these features are indeed included. Unfortunately, we won't be getting the 2 disc special edition those in Germany can enjoy. Oh well."
2,the princess and the borrier... (was that a word?),"I have read just about all of these reviews, and, yes, I agree that some points about the movie were excellent: the soundtrack, the cinematography, and the acting... I suppose it takes a lot of practice to stare at another person for 2 straight hours. Okay, maybe it was more like just one hour because the characters in it spent just about half the movie doing that. I was somewhat expecting another ""Lola,"" but I found just the opposite; that is, a film that trudged along like molasses. I love Franka Potente, but her makeup was horrible compared to her looks in the aforementioned movie and ""Blow."" If one was going to watch this movie, they should either be a student of German or someone who is interested in cinematography because those were its only outstanding assets (well, to me at least... of course they speak German well... they're German). Anyway, if you don't mind a lot of silence and melodrama, this is the film for you."
2,"I was hoping for another ""Run Lola Run""","A disappointment, sorry Franka. I didn't like the story or really anything about the movie. Also, I found Franka's hair and makeup to be very distracting. It just didn't look good on her at all. The only thing that I really liked was at the end with the alter ego. A psychologically artistic ending."
2,Disappointing,"Those who said this was their favorite movie of the year have obviously not seen many good films. It's cinematography was quite mundane. The story had the potential to be interesting, but there was definately something lacking. I was very bored by this movie, though I kept watching with the hope that something cool would happen. It never did."
5,real surreal,An interesting visual story based on a very unlikely set of circumstances. A metaphor for people who are not who they seem to be and who are living lives that do not reflect who they really are.A really good alter ego for Franka as compared to Run Lola Run or the recent Bourne Identity.
3,"Sedate, dark romance","I was not expecting RLR, but the pace needed to increase by about 50% - it was unnecessarily slow. I enjoy these darker films and the story was enjoyable, but the core plot was unoriginal with a few fun twists. The Princess and the Warrior was like the polar opposite of current overhappy, overacting cheesy Hollywood films. It was so much so that often times it felt they story was trying to delve too far into depressing characterizations that I found it having the same effect on me as disposable Hollywood films - losing touch with the characters. I enjoyed it though. Acting was good, the sets (and Franka) were gorgeous and the masterful piece at the end was worth half a star in itself. 3.5/5 stars.P.S. I love you Franka!"
1,"Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb!","This movie is a real dud. How Brandon Lee ever got involved with this ... is beyond me. No fight scenes and a dull, slow-moving plot.Trust me, NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY TO SEE THIS ..."
3,"Awful, But With A Few Good Points","First of all, I confess to being a Brandon Lee fan, so any movie in his unfortunately small filmography is worth watching to me. Brandon did not disappoint, giving a great performance with charm and good humor and making the best of a terrible script. Even so, this is a nebulous, plotless, cliched to the hilt, dull film. But I'm giving it three stars because, believe it or not, I've seen worse...much worse."
2,Hysterical!,"So bad it's good. Lots of big explosions, crazy chases, and fight scenes for such a low budget movie, but the plot, dialogue, and acting are ridiculous. Brandon Lee channels Bruce Campbell at his cheesiest as a mercenary trying to save German scientist Ernest Borgnine, who is kidnapped in Cuba by an evil Austrian and his Russian henchmen who then go to Namibia to mine for diamonds to use in a laser power source that will take over the world by starting WWIII.... you get the idea. Hysterical."
1,Boring Mission,"Brandon Lee vehicle sans copyright, now available at finer dollar stores near you. Boy does it belong there. In fact, the Pentagon should jam all of Iran's television stations with Laser Mission 24/7. The hardliners would end their nuclear program tomorrow. Tom Danger, Agent of World Peace. Ernest Borgnine's been in some dogs, but this is about the bottom of the barrel. Methinks the producer had some incriminating photographs. What's with these movie titles? First Kong Island with neither Kong nor Island, now Laser Mission without Laser. About all I can say is that Debi whateverhernameis bounces around nicely, but when a cute girl is all a film has to recommend it, why not watch porn instead? Besides, the acting's better."
1,HOLY CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is so sad I don't even know how I can tell you how much this movie SUCKED! I am a Brandon Lee fan if you buy this flick it's just to add on to Brandon's small collection. It's a shame Brandon's talents were wasted in this CRAPPY film. The Director should find another job! Maybe directing cheesy porn. Who ever wrote the story should stop smoking crack while they write, the whole movie was just done bad! If I had the equipment I would have done a way better job half asleep! They should of let Brandon do all the fight scenes in his own taste, but instead they had him do 3 punches and one silly kick! The action could had made up for the cheesy plot, but they don't know Sh!*@?! about action! NUFF SAID"
1,The best DVD version of the film yet.,"The best DVD version of the film yet but it is still a crappy movie.The featurre is presented in a 1.33:1 Full Screen format,the DVD does not have any features not even a trailer.But it is the best quality of the film availible in the Region 1 marquet.This film has been released preveously before by numerous companies,and yet this DVD is just a 1/2 step up from the other versions.This review is for the Gemstone Entertainment release."
1,Why`d they remake Danger:Death Ray?,"Please do not pay money for this garbage, it only encourages them. Not entertainingly/MST bad, just `I hate that I wasted time on this` bad. So many Bad Movie Cliches are here--bad accents, unfunny ethnic humor, cars flipping over and exploding like balloons filled with gasoline, cars crashing into stacks of empty boxes, inappropriate and excessive use of slow motion, our hero spraying bullets while exposed to the fire from professional soldiers and hitting everything without being hit during high-speed chases...Just watch something else, or you`ll wish you did, unless you`re such a rabid fan of the mildly talented late actor you`ll love anything he did."
1,I got my order,"...but it looks like this is a pirated DVD. It is poor quality, has lines at the top of the screen and there are portions of the movie that look like tracking problems from the old VCR days. I do not think my copy was an original. At least it arrived very quickly."
1,WHAT A SAD JOKE,"First the sound, well its 'pcm' at a very high distorted level, pic-quality? put is like this - its a cheap old movie copied complete with old film scratches onto dvd, some of the acting is ok but the action is thin, for the money well maybe buy it, but you sure will not be watching this movie often."
1,Not much of a try.,"The plot is not much, but the acting is really poor, slightly above college theatre. On the other hand, the kids try hard, the scenery is real for whatever that is worth, and the violence and ""sex"" is soft enough for 12 year olds, so for... you've got something to engross the kiddies on the long flights."
2,"This is a ""Must Miss"" extraveganza!","If you're a Brandon/Bruce Lee fan to the core, just buy this thing, watch it once and be done (Kind of like watching Game of Death only you don't feel tremendously violated after watching it). I saw this movie last year and even though I cringed, it was good to see the late Brandon Lee in something that was ""new"" to me. If you want a cookie cutter action flick with a bad romance plot, this is the one for you! Also, if you want to be amazed at how many bullets can actually miss an action hero, then this INDEED is the one for you! Believe you me, the sheer amount of bullets that miss Brandon will make your head spin. Talk about point blank!"
5,Good for challenging gifted kids.,We are always looking for ways to challenge our daughter with games and puzzles and this turned out to be a good project. Easy enough that she doesn't give up but hard enough that she is actually learning while she does the puzzle. Depending on the childs age and how much they know about presidents parents may need to help the first several times.
3,"Recall notice only for 1 lot, not entire helmet line","An earlier review noted that the helmet had been recalled. The recall was for a single lot, sold last summer, and not the entire helmet line. It does not appear that the helmet line itself is in question. It is one of the few helmet and pad sets available for kids as young as 3, so I didn't want to dismiss it from my list without checking into the details of the recall."
3,Riveting update of London's classic tale.,"This adaptation of Jack London's story about a mad sea captain and a pampered rich kid is true to the spirit of the original tale, but would doubtless stun London with its ""assertive female"" parts. A thinking person's action film. Also a sad testimony on today's marketing methods that nobody seems to have heard of this film, one of Keach's finest performances."
1,Hilariously bad,"Rubber sets, stoic direction, synth music -- it looks like jack london wrote a '80s porn movie.."
3,The Soundtrack Problem,"All the complaints about the soundtrack on DVD are quite true. However, if you use a 5.1 surround sound system, the sound is quite all right. BUT the sound comes out from the rear speakers only!"
2,Disappointing DVD,"The purchase shipping, handling and arrival was fine. However, I was really disappointed with the DVD itself; it seems to be a not so good Stage play version with a soap opera look and feel. Next I'll try the original 1945 version and see if it's any better."
3,Picture of Dorian Grey,As in all of Oscar Wildes work this had an excellent story line. The acting was wonderful and it followed the book quite well. This is a must see for anyone that values good literature.
2,Uninspired Version of Dorian Gray,"This film seems rather hokey compared to the earlier theatrical version. The production is uninspired and lacks depth into the character of Dorian Gray. The DVD transfer is not very good either but that really doesn't seem to matter. This film can't match the cast of George Sanders, Hurd Hatfield, Donna Reed, and Angela Lansbury of the 1945 version. Shane Briant's performance as Dorian Gray is no match to Hurd Hatfield's outstanding enigmatic performance. Hurd Hatfield owns the cinematic version of Dorian Gray."
3,Testing the Texts,"This is a frequently stimulating inquiry into problems, both major and minor, in the concepts and details of Shakespeare's plots. I found that it raised provocative points (the timeline of OTHELLO, the moral stature of Henry V, how can a soul in Purgatory -- Hamlet senior -- demand blood vengeance?). But authors who nitpick need to watch out more carefully about their own nits. E.g., why on earth is Antony regularly referred to by the authors as ""Anthony""? The strangest lapse comes in the title essay. The opening paragraph celebrates Branagh's HENRY V as the big winner at the Oscars for 1989. But HENRY V wasn't even nominated for Best Movie that year (for the record, DRIVING MISS DAISY won the big one, Branagh, nominated for Best Actor, lost to Daniel Day Lewis, and HENRY V won a single award for Costume Design). Still, a fairly entertaining volume, and one that focuses a number of questions that the reader may not have even realized were questions."
3,L-S-L,"The film wasn't exacty what I expected, but even with diverse reviews by other viewers, one rarely knows what is really good, or, well - unusual . . so okay.."
2,Dissapointed,"This film totally lacked professionalism from start to finish. The fact that it borders child pornography only by a thin line is no surprise in this poorly made foreign film. The ""voiceovers"" were pathetic. I suspect the boy's voice was done by a girl or young woman and did not match the boy's person at all. The same poor quality applied to all the rest of the characters as well. The incest scene with the boy and his Mother was not the worst part of the film. Other scenes depicted a so-called war or conflict happening or about to happen between two countries or cities of which which I have no clue as to the reason or what countries. This conflict had little or no bearing on the plot of the story. Much of the conservation between the other characters, during a party and other times, made absolutely no sense whatsoever and appeared to be used as ""fill-in"" for the purpose of using up time in the film. NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE TIME TO WATCH....."
2,not worth the money,Do yourself a favor and save your money... The movie is boring and the subject matter is considered taboo but you won't see anything it is mostly implied
2,Needs constant adjustment,For the money it is okay - but sems to need constant adjustment. Would set it for a channel then come bak later in the day and needed to adjust again.
3,Helps but not perfect,"I dropped my cable contract and got this instead. It works better than the antenna that came with the set but its not perfect. Each channel seems to need some adjustment. But then hey, if the reception stinks the kids can always read a book.(Of the 7 channels locally broadcast, 1 is unviewable, 1 is poor but viewable and the rest fine. ) But then I didn't want to spend a fortune to do it right."
5,It's a usful CPA Exam reference manual,"This book provides many concepts of Auditing. and If you don't have enough time for studing CPA Exam, You would have read this book. it will focus to pass the exam more faster"
5,A MASTERED PIECE OF ART.,"ROCK 'N' ROLL WARRIORS ISN'T YOUR TYPICAL SAVOY BROWN KIND OF MUSIC. THIS ALBUM IS ROCK INFLUENCED UNLIKE YOUR OTHER SAVOY BROWN LP'S WHICH ARE BLUES BASED. RALPH MORMAN'S STYLE OF VOCALS IS SIMPLY SUPERB. AND FOR OTHERS LIKE MYSELF WHO CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS GREAT VOCALIST CHECK OUT THE JOE PERRY PROJECT CD LET THE MUSIC DO THE TALKING, OR RALPH MORMANS FIRST BAND ( BUX - WE CAME TO PLAY. --> OOP ) IT'S DEFINATLY WORTH LISTENING TO.SO SIT BACK, POP IN THE CD, AND IT WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO 1981.TWO THUMBS UP AND FIVE *****."
5,One of the greatest gospel groups I've ever heard,"I remembered purchasing both cassettes by this group (that tells how long it's been), and instantly, I was blown away by the lead vocals and the background harmony.It's a shame that so many people slept on this talented group's music. ""This Joy"" has a jazz flare, which you hear when the background vocals sings the words, ""It flows just like a river deep within my soul"", and the rest of the songs just takes a soul to unimaginable places, that once the music ends, you feel like you have just went on a paradise journey with Jesus Christ, himself. Great Music, Talented Group, and I'm proud to still have the music to experience the uplifting when I need to be uplifted :)"
3,It's better than a stick in the eye...,"I won't go long winded. If you have time to kill and like westerns, watch it. It will NOT be something that will stay in your mind very long."
3,Texas Rangers,"plenty of action,a little slow in parts, apart of this i enjoyed this movie.a little of how good will beat bad."
1,Texas Rangers,"Disc freezes at 17.48 minutes into movie. is unplayablefor about 57 seconds. Disc is advertised as VERY GOOD,but is actually DEFECTIVE."
1,NOT THE CORRECT ASPECT RATIO!,"I can't believe we have to deal with this incorrect aspect ratio again! Come on people enough of this ""I want my tv screen filled up"" b#$sh#$t. We have widescreen televisions and blu ray I had to buy the old dvd to get the correct aspect ratio of 2:35 Don't buy Echo Bridge titles!"
3,RANDY TRAVIS' BIGEST FAN,In my opinion the best thing about this movie is Randy Travis.He did a good job and looked great!I anxiously await his next movie.The Practice star needs to stick with TV.
3,Texas Rangers,"Would have been nice to have subtitles. I like the movie. However, I have older movies that have been prepared with more features than this. My rating is based more on the disc preparation than the movies itself."
4,Westerns,"Great movie, I love western movies, wish they would make some more, not near enough on the market, it is refreshing to watch a movie without all the cursing, sex & what have you, these have an actual story to them"
4,good enough for the big screen,"the story, characters, actors, and scenery are great!and the action is some of the best I've seen in ANY western!this is a must see, that I'm sure you'll want to keep"
3,How the West Was...Politely Tamed,"Texas Rangers is not as bad as you've heard. Sure, the timeline is a little wonky (think of this as McNelly's greatest hits) and takes some liberty with the history (namely McNelly's family life and his relationship with King), but those are pretty small flaws. The action scenes are well put together, more Young Guns 2 than Young Guns, and the acting is adequate--Ashton Kutcher and Usher being in it and all.It's a decent movie, and if you like Texas History I believe you'll enjoy it."
1,Warning Price is for only one fork,Boy were we surprised when we received a largish box with only one fork. These may be good forks but $11.95 (plus S&H) is pricey for one fork.
5,C'MON MAN!,OK first of all that song #$%@ the police is good but not great. Anyway this album is great! Every song is 5 stars. Oh and the album is fine without that song.
2,RIPOFF!,"OMG! The biggest reason i bought this CD was because i thought it had history on it. That history was the song ""**** Tha Police"". But no, this CD doesn't have it. To get the real deal, get the unedited version. Peace."
5,All 4 videos in ONE!,"At first I wasn't sure what was on the tape because there were no reviews, but the tape combines one 10 minute workout from each of Denise Austin's Hit the Spot series (abs, thighs, buns, and arms/bust). The tape is great for an all over tone up because everything is all on one tape, and lasts about 45-50 minutes, and just because there is only 10 min. for each part doesn't make it easy! The tape is a great way to ""get your feet wet"" with toning exercises because you only need the one tape (and not 4), and the segments are broken up, so you don't have to do all of it at one time."
2,Disappointed with results (or lack thereof)...,"Unlike most of the other reviews, I got no results from repeatedly doing this video. I was doing it at least 3x week alternating with 30 min. aerobics daily and saw no change in my thighs/hips. I've tried several videos for my lower body as that's my problem spot but to no avail. I'm not overweight but would like to tone up my rear and thighs. This tape wasn't the answer for me. I don't mind Denise's enthusiasm. She tries to make you feel good just for exercising (and you should). If anyone has a tape that will work, let me know..."
1,Poorly written compilation of silly and outdated methods,"This book was obviously not written from experience. Minnery pretends to be an expert, but falls way short and even shorter as an author. I've read non-fiction accounts that have far more useful information in a few paragraphs than this whole book has. A real disappointment, don't waste your money or time."
2,It's the end of the world as we know it.....,"I had acquired copies of these books many years ago when a friend of mine recommended them to me, then a couple of years ago I gave them all away to someone who had shown some interest in them, along with numerous manuals on improvised weapons and munitions. I'm stunned to see that they are now listed at $200.....I felt that I had been ripped off at $10. apiece. I suspect that someone will, however, buy these and put them on the shelf next to their copy of The Anarchists Cookbook. And why not, they all have the same validity.People have been killing each other for millennia without the 'benefit' of a guide book, and I'm sure they will continue to do so.Rather than a book called ""How To Kill""....Mr. Minnery would have been better advised to write a book called ""How Not To Get Caught."""
1,Propaganda plain and simple.,"This notorious video is a hustle that lightened the wallets of thousands of well meaning Christian people. A tissue of lies. As Carrie Rengers, a reporter for the Republican newspaper Arkansas-Democrat-Gazette newspaper said: ""Apparently honesty isn't necessary in videos."" Her attempts to varify claims concerning the financial and other fanciful allegations here all proved fruitless. (see the October 30, 1994 issue). How can anyone calling themselves Christian condone such wholesale fleecing of worshippers in the name of a political agenda in every way hostile to America's heritage of freedom?"
1,Comedy or Serious?,"This tape was so absurd that I had to wonder whether the makers were trying to make a comedy or an actual conspiracy piece. The only thing scarier than the idea that there may actually be people paranoid and bizzare enough to make a film like this and mean it is the other reviews I see of it here--we have some strange and sad Americans among us, folks. Let's hope they stay in the backwoods and away from civilization and the rest of us.The tape is filled with nonsense insinuations and coincidence in an attempt to throw everything including the kitchen sink they remember from childhood story books at Clinton. It's clearly made by people who dislike the president and are convinced there must be *something* wrong and, doggonit, they're gonna find it. Or make it up if they have to. Save your money. Or if you're really dying for a bunch of outlandish conspiracy theories, get the JFK movie. At least it uses professional actors and has better cinematography. You'll be better entertained."
4,Another Shameful Example of Clinton's Arrogance & Deception,This is one of the lowest points in all presidential history. Clinton's conduct catches up to him and all he can do is attempt to hide behind a thin veil of legal definitions of words. He is delusional if he really believes that his in-office affair is a personal and private matter. This all occurred during the day at work! If this happened to any one of us in the private sector we would be out on our ear the same day. This president has advisors on every aspect of conducting the nation's business with the sole exception of personal conduct. Clinton has proven that he has failed miserably in the one area that he is totally accountable for...his own personal conduct. Here will lie his legacy.
1,WATCH THE PART NUMBER - the glove fits but won't run,"Apparently ordering an HP 4250 maintenance kit gives you a 50% chance of ordering the correct part. We had been a good little organization and ordered a backup fuser kit for our HP 4250 almost a year ago. Our fuser went bad. Installed the fuser from our inventory part number RM1-1082 - [THIS KIT]. Next, our printer gave a 13.20.00 error saying to clear a paper jam though there was no paper jam. (Nice job of the engineer's part for the correct description of the problem) Put the old fuser back in and jam was gone though printing still smeared and crumpled. Upon searching the chat forms others had noticed that there is a difference between RM1-1082 and RM1-0013. It's been 11 months since I ordered the part and now I've no hope to return a never-used $210 fuser as the ""return window"" expired February 2011."
1,Poor Poor Poor,The fuser went out at 69% remaining. Do not purchase. This was from AccutekImaging. I will only buy OEM merchandise going forward.
1,NOT GENUINE HP,"As others have reviewed, this is not genuine HP although they charge a genuine price and have a genuine part pictured.Buyer beware!"
1,Don't buy from this retailer,I installed this Maintenance Kit just to find out that it was defective. Store will not exchange product or give a store credit. I was told pretty much to take the $279 loss and live with it. When I called the manufacturer they told me that the retailer is responsible for the return but they said no way. Buyer beware.
2,Recycled exchange NOT OEM AS STATED,"The parts all look to be in good condition but I am still VERY unsatisfied because the description lists this as OEM equipment when it is actually a previously recycled unit that comes with a core exchange requirement which is not listed in the description at all. If I was looking for a recycled unit, I would have searched for and chosen a recycled unit instead of NEW or OEM."
4,DIY,"All printers need help over time and will require repairs, it's a given. With this kit you don't have to pay a tech to breath new life into your printer."
2,Very Dissappointed,"This Item looks like a really good purchase, but after I received it, I discovered that the product is only Mild Steel not Stainless Steel. I am very dissappointed with the supplier, I called their toll free number and was told that it wasn't their problem. Now to get satisfaction I have to return this order to Amazon at extra cost to me!! from Canada to the USA. Poor communication always leaves the customer with a POOR IMAGE of their business transation!!!!!"
1,Okay...,"Let me just say first of that digimon was cool when it first came out. All the kids liked it just like pokemon, but now...its really starting to get lame! I just outgrew it. I mean when shows like outlaw star and trigun came along digimon couldn't compete. Its cool for younger kids, but as for us teens, its just to embarrassing."
1,Boring...,Digimon is begining to get oh so Boooooringgggg...*snore* oh sorry I fall asleep just thinking about it. Their no longer in the digital world so why bother watching it? Believe me don't buy this video. It's a waste of money...*snore*:(
4,Monty Python T-shirt,"I loved the Monty Python T-shirt. -Just didn't like the material used to spell out 'I'm a lumberjack...'. It was fuzzy, not a flat print."
4,Hard workout.,I like doing this workout when I have lots of energy. You really feel like you've worked hard when you've finished. Don't really like the music.
5,Great Yoga workout,"I ordered three of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's yoga videos. I had never practiced Kundalini yoga, although I have done other styles. At first, I thought the movements and breathing exercises were a little odd. My kids made fun of me, the dog looked at my funny and growled during the mantra at the end of one of the videos. That being said, I enjoyed the practice and I felt phenomenal the next day after doing the Warrior workout. I got up out of bed and my joints felt well lubricated and ready to start the day--no small feat for someone with arthritic hip joints. My muscles felt strong and well worked. The best part is that my lower back soreness and tightness that I had been experiencing over past month was greatly reduced. I haven't tried my third DVD yet, but I expect it to be a great workout too."
2,Returned this DVD,"I purchased this DVD based on so many of the positive reviews, but I couldn't have been more disappointed. The instructional section on breathing was not at all helpful. The workout itself was boring, and even after completing the whole thing I didn't feel that I had done a workout at all. I have practiced yoga (mostly Iyengar) for about 10 years, so I do know my way around a yoga mat...there are much better Kundalini DVDs out there."
2,"Very weird, uncomfortable, NOT a workout","Ugh - the reviews were pretty good for this video so I thought I would give it a try. I started Yoga about 6 months ago and have been looking for more advanced stuff. This might be great for some people, but for me, it was a total waste of time and really, really weird. My husband came down and asked WHAT I was doing. Plus, I barely started to sweat and this workout is LONG. A waste of my money."
1,Warrier Work Out?,I was expecting the typical warrier series in this DVD. I was very disappointed. Although I have been studying yoga for many years I found this DVD to be extremely advanced and too difficult.
3,A little disappointing,"I'm a huge fan of Ana and Ravi DVDs, but this is really one of my least favorite. The workout is difficult but doable, and that's what matters. On the other hand, Ana's voiceover is particularly annoying in this one, and doesn't make for a great meditative experience. Also, the video is strange -- not skipping, but the timing is off, which makes it pretty difficult to follow Ana ""to the rhythm of the breath of fire."" This is also one where they use repeat loops of the voiceovers, which is annoying if you do the video enough. Overall, it's worth buying for the workout and meditation, which are really great, but you're going to have to grit your teeth and bear Ana talking."
4,not for beginners,"This work is indeed good, but well, I had been out of kundalini practice for a while, and on the first try, I could not finish the routine; It supposes that you have already some base training and quite good stamina. To start a bit more gently, try Rodney Yee."
5,Fantastic Yoga Sweat Fest,"This DVD is a high powered sweat fest. It's pretty much non-stop until the deep relaxation. Every single muscle gets worked, as well as your nerves, glands, inner organs, and more. Flexibility and strength are equally covered. There's sort of a Down Dog to Up Dog chattaranga sequence which is like a workout unto itself. On all of the Ravi & Ana DVD's they include a lot of great ab work. The demonstration by Ana Brett is inspiring to say the least. She's a real yoga athlete, right up there with Rodney Yee. Their instruction, is perfect. Also, their inspiring little quips stay in my head all day and make me a better person. There is so much to like about this DVD, I could keep writing and writing..."
5,Shadoan - An Adventure NOT another shoot 'em up (Finally!),"This game takes thought, not a fast trigger finger. This is an adventure game where you have to explore, collect items & use them and have fun. There is some fighting involved but it is NOT a shoot 'em up or die video game. I love that I can play it on my DVD player. If you'd rather think and explore instead of killing everything in sight, this is a game for you! Reminds me of Zork or other not so gorey adventure games."
4,Fine Subtle Slapstick Comedy!,"In today's world of the need for dynamic action to keep you glued to the screen, this comedy requires relaxation and ""paying attention"" to be able to catch and observe the comic genius subtileness of Tati. If you turn your head for a minute, you will miss many of the humorous tidbits. Warning!!, the younger generation may find you odd when you enjoy this tape and try to share it with them."
3,Too much editing in this version,"Sadly, this is an edited version that cuts many wonderful scenes that were in the original French version.Still good but not as good as the uncut film."
4,One of Tati's best movies,"If not Tati's best film (that honor would probably go to Mon Oncle), this 1953 effort is certainly his funniest, as Mr. Hulot's (Tati) presence in a french resort provokes one disaster after another. The movie is deliberately paced, with little dialog and full of gentle humor. In fact, the film's innocence would be very hard to recreate today (the movie looks irresistibly nostalgic now, as it evokes a certain time and period that no longer exists). You might think that this is not a recipe for an uproariously funny comedy, but despite that, you just can't stop laughing at Tati's very elaborate set pieces. It's a huge improvement over Tati's previous film, Jour de Fete, a movie I found to be hugely overrated. One thing that surprised me when I saw the movie is its very gentle mockery of the German tourists: one would think that just 8 years after the war, a more brutal and bitter humor would have been handed at the expense of the pair."
5,The best.,Often silly but unbelievably brilliant as well. The film is almost entirely wordless but it will hold your attention and keep you laughing throughout.
5,Classic humour,"After 'Jour de Fete', 'M. Hulot's Holiday' was Jacques Tati's second film, and I first saw it when it was first produced in about 1953. I have never tired of seeing it again and again. There is very little talking and the humour is mostly visual, observing peoples' peccadilloes. The humour is quiet, not slapstick, and a contrast to the more robust comedies of Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton. It is a perfect evening's entertainment."
4,"I have no doubt that Steve Martin, Rowan Atkinson and Peter Sellers studied Jacques Tati's Hulot","A great looking movie which retains it's charm, humor and wry insight after more than half a century. I think many of the gags could have been improved by allowing them to develop a bit longer, but they're still good as is. Undoubtedly influential and I have no doubt that Steve Martin, Rowan Atkinson and Peter Sellers studied Jacques Tati's Hulot. I found it also a bit reminiscent of Hayao Miyazaki's gentle family films such asMy Neighbor Totoro."
5,M. Hulot's Holiday,A delightful movie from a gentler time. I first saw this in a 16 mm. cinematic format at a friend's house and when it was announced recently that it would be available as a DVD I ordered it. Jacques Tati has no dialog but conveys a wealth of expression and develops very humorous situations via body language.
2,The US video version a sad disappointment,"I saw this film when it was first released in 1956 and enjoyed every minute. I bought the US video version as a Christmas (2001) present to give to friends who also saw it on its first release and was very surprised when they said they were very disappointed with the video. I understood why when I, too, saw the US video version with US-English sub-titles that were superfluous and completely wrecked the concept of a film that depended entirely on sound effects rather than dialogue for comedy. I had thought of buying 'Mon Oncle' as well but, having seen what was done to Ms Hulot, I'm glad I didn't waste my money on another disappoinment."
3,Not so great,"Tastes in comedy must have really changed in the last 50 years. I found most of the humor in this to be very strained. How did this film ever win at Cannes? Must not have been anything better that year.There are simply too many fabricated events: people almost getting hit by cars, spilling things, bumping into each other, etc. People getting scared by the ""shark"" was just silly. How could anyone think that looked like a shark?There were a few convincing slapstick moments that made me laugh. What I liked most about the film, though, is that it brought me back to a time when people HAD to interact with others more than they do today. And it was something special to go on a picnic, or ride a horse, or go to the beach."
3,An aquired taste,"Having never seen a Tati film in my 40 something years, I was probably expecting too much from this 1950's French comedy. It certainly has its merits. There are some lovely visual gags, which are very clever and funny as well, together with a set of characters who develop with the film.I found that at 83mins it dragged a bit and whilst the jazzy music theme was great the first time I heard it, after the theme had been repeated about a dozen times it began to get on my nerves. Tati himself was undoubtably a talented visual comedian, and if he had been working 30 years earlier, before the introduction of sound would probably have been a bigger star. If I had seen this film when I was very young I'm sure that it would have made a lasting impression on me (like Laurel & Hardy) and I would have rated it much higher.As it is, I probably need to see it again to fully appreciate it. Then it may get four stars."
1,There was only 1 funny part in the whole movie...,when Mr. Hulo drops a pitcher and it bounces back up. Then he drops another glass and it shatters...whoop-dee-doo! I don't have to say more; that sums the whole thing up! The End! Hope you enjoyed it...NOT!
5,One of the all-time funny movies I have ever seen,Jacques Tati is a comic genius who needs few words to communicate. Holiday is a wonderful farce at the beach.
3,Hulot,"Jacques Tati is one of those guys with a natural gift for the physical gag. This DVD features his holiday, as the title would imply. We meet some vacationers at a beach resort, and the filmmaker revels in that. Then Tati appears on the scene, M. Hulot in all his glory, and wreaks havoc. I thought it might have been a little slow getting started, but it was building. It's a marvelous film.The DVD also contains an early short from 1939, with Jacques Tati as a boxer in something written by somebody else. The style reminded me of one of those shorts by The Little Rascals before they had sound, Spanky, Alfalfa, Buckwheat... What, you never saw any of those? Well, they were funny. You'll just have to trust me on this."
2,second-rate version of first rate film,"I saw Mr Hulot's Holiday at its first U.S. showing on televsion, probably in 1953, and became a lifelong fan. I recently bought both ""Holiday"" and what I always connsidered Tati's finest, ""Playtime."" While I enjoy the two films, they are both an almost unbearable disappointent in the Americanized versions.Jacques must have been given bad advice about us to diminish his masterpieces with the addition of slapstick. I wish I knew how to get the originals."
2,Prophets,I did't like the content or the way it was presented. Very superficial. Not good for scholars.
1,BE CAREFUL!!!,"CALPH NO LONGER PRODUCES THIS LINE... WILL NOT REPLACE IF DAMAGED!! GO FOR THE NEWER ""ONE"" LINE OF COOKWARE."
1,All its cracked up to be...,"My pans came with a crack in 2 of them... When tried to get them replaced, was given a 2 month run around! Ridiculous!"
5,I have heard the future,"This is what people talk about when they say music should speak. It is amazing that this little group could churn out such everyday sounds layered on top of heartfelt yet never maudlin lyrics. The lyricist (described as d. ahearn) seems more poet philosopher king than ""johnny rock star"". I am certain that not enough people will hear this groundbreaking album - clearly one of the best in my entire collection. Expect to hear more from this group - and hopefully y'all be hearing this in your everyday experiences"
5,Refreshing,Every time I listen to the songs on this CD I hear something I've not noticed before. It's freshness is what captures me and encourages me to listen again and again. The melodies are at times haunting and the lyrics deeply thoughtful. The sounds are infused with soulfulness and feeling. I am enjoying this and look forward to hear more in the future.
5,Love my Havaianas sandals,"Well u can guess that I am German; so finding these soccer world cup sandals was the best. I love them; they are comfortable yet durable. Great value for the money. I actually 5 more pairs since then. Love, love, love them."
4,A good option for people on the fringe,"Too far away to get local chanels on your dish? Too close to get a waiver? Tired of rabbit ears? I was all three and this antenna proved to be a good solution. It clips right on the dish and uses the dishes power and wiring to pipe the antenna signal into your home. It doesn't take the ""seconds"" listed on the box but I was up and running in about 15 minutes and getting near perfect reception on stations that were snowy with every other method I tried. If your dish is on your roof you might need to set aside an hour or two.One word of warning. When we used the TV/Video button (per our sat manual) to access the antenna signal we got nothing but snow. We were getting ready to disconect the antenna to return it but when I turned the power off on the reciever our local chanels suddenly cleared right up."
4,Great Antenna for Dish Owners,I bought the Terk TV-42 not expecting much if any improvement over my amplified set of rabbit ears considering my house is about 30 miles away from the local broadcast towers. I however was pleasantly surprised to discover the reception was much better than I had expected. All of my local channels are watchable with several being crystal clear. The UHF reception could be a little better but overall it is not bad. It sure beats an ugly antenna on the roof and since it is outside it works better than set top antennas.
1,I wouldn't waste my money on this,"Easy to install but doesn't work very well. The stations I could pick up with rabbit ears were snowy with this and one station I couldn't pick up at all. I picked up one other station, so still had to use the rabbit ears for 3 stations. I have taken the Antenna down as it was causing problems with the dish network signal. The connections on the antenna had rubber coverings that have all split, and this since the end of August, 2006. I suspect water was getting in the connections and causing the signnal problem with dish network. It would loose the satelite signal and try to get it back. Find some other antenna and don't buy this one!!!"
5,Terk Antenna,Product works well with my Directv system to allow me to receive local channels. Easy installation and hookup.
1,Virtually no improvement over rabbit ears,"Installation was easy enough, except for that whol climbing on the roof thing, but that's more my problem than Terk's. It probably took 15 minutes to install the thing, but when I went back inside and hooked it up, I had an incredible amount of snow on every station. Although I could see every channel, they were all unwatchable. The worst part was that I needed to climb back up onto the roof so I could return the thing. I still can't figure out how TV survived until cable came into existence."
1,Worthless,"I installed this Antenna, hooked it all up, and the reception was worse than the rabbit-ears I was already using. ..."
2,Captain feathersword costume,"This costume is for my 4 year old daughter. She was upset that the eyepatch fell apart the first time she tried it on. The hat is a flat, floppy imitation of a pirate hat. The nylon costume ran the first time she tried it on. We were also disappointed that the coordinating feathersword was not available to order."
2,Keeping track of back row hitters...,"I am a ref, and, I bought this to try and keep track of back row hitting. For a ref, it's too small, and, the dry erase markers you need to use on ittake up too much space, and the spaces are too small.I like the idea, but should have bought the larger version. With high school substitution rules you need to be able to write more then one numberin each part of the pie. Also, finding really fine dry erase markers that worked on it was not easy or cheap.Good idea. Get the bigger version."
3,"Pretty cover, but mediocre maps and photos","As a professional cartographer, I was excited to add this atlas to my map research collection, but I was disappointed by the quality of the maps and photographs. The maps are numerous and reasonably clear, but the cartography is 30 years old, and they look like photocopies. Same for the pictures--poor contrast, grainy, and ugly. I've seen some of the same stock photos in other books, where they were given a much better treatment.The scope of the atlas reaches wide, but not deep. Nearly every campaign is covered, but in little detail. I would have appreciated more footnotes and sources also.The price is reasonable for a thick atlas, but I would've gladly paid twice the price for a better looking product."
3,akward,"i like the collapsable part. i bought this for my sister in law to take to the farmers market. she always buys a bag of oranges, and i thought this would work well for her. i tried it out myself. the oranges seemed too heavy for comfortably using this bag. its akward and the handle needs to be longer/higher. you have to hold it upright. it won't stand on it's own. if you are walking far the handle really starts to rub your hand raw."
4,very useful,"I don't have a car and doing grocery shopping is sometimes quite a chore. This bag is very practical and helpful. I can keep it rolled in my bag (even a small messenger bag) and use as needed.The con is, that all foldable rolling bags have much less support, so if you pack it full with groceries, your arms will feel it! Great exercise :)"
1,not complete movie..only first part of mini series,this is the first part of a made for tv mini series...bad acting aside...the fact that we get left hanging is horrible..but i purchased this at a discount store for four movies for 4.99... lol..so i dont think i made as much of an investment as some on here have made for the movie. how ever this does not take away from the fact that the movie was incomplete...i have tried to find the second half online...im not paying a large amount for the movie guarantee...the movie has several different titles so be on guard for look a likes...and you will notice the good feed back is only for a band that some how has the same name as one of the movie titles they use for the film...good luck...
2,Uuggrrrhhhhh !!! It ends abruptly !!!,"Bought it from Amazon and watched it till the end just to be cut short with untimely and abrupt end !!! The film is good but the ending is not what i expect from western movie. There was no climax at all, the bad won over the good till the end. Is there 2nd part of this film ?"
3,"Is this""Lone Justice Live"" at the Ritz?","The release dates in the spec's are way off.I think this is the reason for the comments in the second review. The release date is 1987 for the December 1986 concert.I agree that the cover photo should be pictured. Several western movies had this name. If this is the real thing, I give it a 5. I had the original concert off MTV or VH1 and bought the VHS tape when I found it. Looks like none of her other work made it to DVD athough I have 2 of her CD's."
4,What happened?,"I just finished watching Ned Blessing The True Story of My Lifeand enjoyed it very much, I too wonder how it ends. If it is a TV pilot then bring it on, We need more interesting story lines on television then just Law and Order, CSI's the world over, that seem to be always on the air ways. Too many soap operas night and day not to mention reality shows. As for the previous review, the Ned Blessing The True Story of My Life I watched starred Danial Baldwin not Stephen, maybe that is why you did not enjoy it. This movie was not by any means an Oscar winner but very enjoyable to just sit down relax and be entertained for a few minutes."
3,Works good as long as it's compatible,"I bought this remote control about 4 years ago and it worked on by TV, VCR, and Audio receiver. I could never make it work with my CD player or cable box.The manual comes with a list of codes which is supposed to make it easy to program. I was not so lucky. There's a code search which you can program by hitting the function and then another button up to a hundred times until it's recognized. This became a pain if the batteries click out of place and you have to re-program it (which happened to me over and over).Recently I picked up a new version of it after mine stopped working thinking that they may have improved it over the years. This one won't recognize my audio receiver at all and it looks like there haven't been any significant changes. This one's going in the garbage."
4,vocals,"The music was consistently excellent, but I would have enjoyed it more if some of Poland's jazz vocalists were featured.thank you,Patty Gorski-Diaz"
4,THE KILLER WAS NEVER CAUGHT,"I REMEMBER MY 16 YEAR OLD COUSIN SEEING THIS AND BEING AFRAID TO STAY AT HOME BY HIMSELF AFTER SCHOOL. HE WOULD WALK TO MY HOUSE AND WAIT UNTIL HIS PARENTS CAME HOME FROM WORK. HIS REASONING WAS THAT WE LIVED NEAR TEXARKANA, AND AT THE TIME, THE MURDERES HAPPEND BARELY 30 YEARS BEFORE. AND SINCE THE KILLER WAS NEVER CAUGHT, IT WAS PLAUSABLE THAT HE COULD STILL BE OUT THERE WAITING TO KILL AGAIN."
3,sorry Texasarkana,what? I was surprised to find out that this was a true story. It was alot of screaming and blood. Whew! Hope he's dead by now!!!!!!
2,My Grandfather was the Hooded Killer,"I had the distinct pleasure of hearing the accounts of the ""Town That Dreaded Sundown"" from my 90 year old grandfather first-hand.My grandfather was discharged from the Army in 1944-45 with Psychological problems and claimed years later that he was the killer that terrorized the Ark-La-Tex. He had several wounds consistent with the ones imposed on the killer, to include a bullet still lodged in his arm and part of one of his knee caps missing. I remember seeing the movie with him when I was young. He also had a 45 caliber handgun that was supposedly like the one the killer used. One of the victims played by Dawn Wells was a distant relative of our family. She survived. My grandfather passed away at the age of 91 on July 1, 2001 in a New Boston Texas nursing home."
1,Should have been rated XXX for violence,"...This movie was EXTREMELY disturbing. During the murder of the girl, tied to a tree by a knife on the end of a trombone, the way it is depicted, it is like you are sitting on the ground at a campfire watching it happen. As I remember it, there was no music, just the ""umphs"" as the murderer repeatedly drove the knife into her back. It made me want to jump up and stop the killing - which of course was impossible. Interesting enough, the Son of Sam murders started shortly after this, but nothing has ever been said about that. The similarities between the killings is creepy. Did Son of Sam see this movie? I do not know. But like I said, the parallels are disturbing. Finally, you have to be one demented person to want to see this movie more than once. To get ""pleasure"" out of seeing people ruthlessly murdered should not be not normal..."
1,Dont waste your time!,Story about a killer who wears a pillow case over his head in the 1940's. Far too bland to work as a slasher flick!
3,3.5 stars The Town That Dreaded Sundown,"The Town That Dreaded Sundown is based on a true story of a ""Phatom Killer"" in Texarkana,Texas 1946,who was never caught. The movie itself is not a cheap slasher flick like the picture on the box may suggest. The Phatom Killer goes after teens at Lover's Lane, on rainy Saturday Nights 21 days apart,or so the local police think. After two murders that follow that pattern the local police stakeout various locations of the town to try to prevent the next murder. Their effort fails, and the town lives in fear of the Phantom Killer. Not a bad movie, but it does tend to sag here and there. It would be good for those looking for a suspense film, that isn't loaded with buckets of blood and gore."
5,Thank .. Ronald Brezenski,Ronald's... review... of this... movie... was great... I think that... he is.. one great reviewer... of movies... although I don't ... know why... he likes to... put '...'s in between... a lot of his.. words... to boot.(I have not seen the movie. But I am a real big Charles B. Pierce fan.) You can... trust that.. a movie by... Charlie will be great... to boot.
4,The Town That Dreaded Sundown,"Love this old movie! It's campy, the characters are both interesting and amusing. The story is based on true events but they keep it light enough to keep it from being as horrible as it must have been. If you love some of the original ""docu-dramas"" from the '70's (Like ""The Legend of Boggy Creek"" about the Bigfoot creatures they claim exist down in Louisiana) this one will knock your socks off. I only gave it a 4 because being on VHS tape it's a little fuzzier and would be even better on DVD. The movie itself, though, is awesome! Thanks & Enjoy! Buy this movie!!!!!"
1,Town Terrorized by Charles Pierce,"Move maker Charles Pierce must have been a student of Ed Wood. In ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" he takes an exciting true story and turns it into fiction - very bad fiction. Complimented by some of the worst acting since Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" this film trivializes a killer stalking a city. Not only does Pierce get the details wrong,(the dialogue speaks of 5 killings before the 5th victim is killed) but Academy Award winner Ben Johnson wanders as if in a daze through this over-acted and under budgeted film, seemingly thankful when the fictitious ending arrives. (They have a shoot out with the Phantom when in reality many think he was the car thief who had been previously arrested). The killings stopped after the arrest. A much better story would have been to film what actually happened but then no car chases and no shoot-outs. I lived in Texarkana during that time and this film does not bring that frightening story to life."
3,LET'S GO TROJANS,"The movie is primarily a spoof of ""Troy"" but tosses in some other film bits for good measure. Will Sasso stars as the blue collar Awesomest Maximus, legendary general of Troy. His wife, Hottessa (Kristanna Loken) is the princess. Her brother is named Orlando instead of Paris (Gary Lundy) who is gay. He absconds with Ellen of Troy (Sophia Monk) in order to make the King of Greece jealous. Ian Ziering plays Testiclees in the manner of Brad Pitt. His incestuous mother looks like Angelina Jolie from ""Alexander."" I think you get the idea of the satire.When the movie is not spoofing other movies, the humor is overly sexual. When you divide National Lampoon films into classics and not so classics, this falls below the line. If you enjoyed the film ""Your Highness"" you might try this one too.F-bomb, sex, nudity (background strippers mostly, no stars)"
4,"Funny, in the right setting","I was high when I saw this on TV a few days ago. I'm not sure if I overanalyzed the movie because I was high, but it seemed like every single scene took the dialogue way past the point of relevance. Each character would go off into a rant about something that otherwise might seem stupid, but I thorougly enjoyed the movie being in the state of mind that I was in. Kind of like ""House Of Payne"", it's stupid unless you're under the influence of something. I loved MadTV, so it was nice to see Will Sasso. This is much better than the 3 Stooges movie he was just in if you're wondering.I recommend watching it, but don't expect much."
3,A Guilty Pleasure,"Bottom line, this is a gutter humor movie. It's not my thing. I'm not a prude by any means, but gutter humor is for the simple minded. That being said, I didn't know this before I watched it. This movie for the most part was down right gut busting laugh out loud hillarious, but went too far in some cases, and a lot of the crude scenes were completely unnecessary, and didn't add to the movie at all. Don't watch with the wife, and definitely don't watch with the kids if they are under 18. In fact, just don't watch with your kids or family at any age. The title of my review says it all. This movie is a guilty pleasure best enjoyed alone."
2,As expected.,"I bought this because Kristanna Loken was in it...simple as that. Silly and at times, goofy low budget spoofing of the genre has its moments, but overall, not for me."
2,Don't expect it to work without clear view of sky.,"Bought this as part of a Christmas gift for a friend who lives in an apartment complex. We first installed the antenna on TV close to an inside wall with no luck. After moving the TV and antenna closer to an outside wall close to a window, some reception was achieved but nothing like what my grandparents get with similar antennas."
3,Not good for City Use,"The Antenna works OK. However, it is not very good for using in a city dwelling."
5,"Historic, aggressive and raw","This record is a snapshot of how grunge was like before the mainstream recognized it. The sound is heavy ,aggressive and very underground for that matter of fact. All the songs on the album are great, my favorite is ""The Birds"" by Skin Yard. Soundgarden's early material sounds good even though its unpolished. I received my product in great condition and it even came earlier then expected through the mail."
3,Lacking,If you want to grab something to throw in the car this isn't bad. But if you are going off into the woods for more that 24 hours build your own kit and know how to use everything in it.
4,The cow who fell in the canal,"This is a book I read to my sons. My oldest son who now has a son wanted it to read to his boy. Since it has been out of print for many years, I was happy to find it for him. It arrived a few days before his birthday so was a special gift for him."
4,Excellent book,"I studied from this book last year and it really deserves a 4.5. Even though it is ""synthetic"" Latin, it is some of the best I've read. I'm a fan of grammar, and the book does a good job teaching it (however, I do feel that more advanced topics should be covered in first and second year Latin).Make sure you have a competent teacher when using this book - I do not recommend it for independent study. While some grammar *is* well explained, other topics really aren't, and you need a good teacher to explain them to you."
4,"Readable, simplified Latin","ECCE ROMANI sidesteps one mistake of other introductory Latin textbooks by being a bit sneaky about conveying just how different Latin is from English (and yet gets into it early on). It gives specific background and cultural vignettes (in English) and it builds up a large enough vocabulary to support interesting readings, helped by being connected stories about a family doing Roman things; it is like reading a novel about people who are normal Romans and yet we see why that makes these normal people act in Roman ways that would not be normal for us.While working with WHEELOCK'S LATIN with an auto-didact group, I find ECCE ROMANI a refreshing way to review. (A fellow student was put off by the different approach to language.)"
4,Classic,"From a time when good morals could be learned from TV. An excellent introduction to Eastern Asian philosophy. Actors who guest starred were varied. Watching Keye Luke as a mature man is fascinating to anyone who remembers the old Warner Oland ""Charlie Chan"" series when Mr. Luke played 'No. 1 son'. If you get a chance to see ""The Good Earth"" with Paul Muni you can see both Keye Luke and Philip Ahn as young men."
5,Being the designer of Kung Fu....,"I am pretty annoyed by some of the reviews here blaming ME for the mistake of ""the cenotaph."" I originally had that correct title and was told to change it to ""the cenopath."" So please...dont' blame me!If you doubt me, check out the International sleeves, which I designed...and has ""the cenotaph."""
1,anyone else have a problem,"I recently purchased this set and put the first disc in my dvd and it looked fantastic, after they started the dialoge it was quite noticeable that the soundtrack did not match the visuals, it was totally off. This was the first disc, first episode,the second episode did'nt have that problem, but there were two sccenes that just faded out. The third episode was ok. Iam not even going to go thru the entire set and plan on returning this as it is defective. I purchased it at a major warehouse club. Has anyone else had this problem? I was all set on watching this in it's entirety. I am sure my rating will improve when i get another copy."
5,Sweeeet,"A lot of the reviews for season 1 complaned about racisim.Bruce Lee got beat out for th roll by David Carradine. The ideaof a white guy being a Saolin monk was silly. This only remindsme of the words ""Read not the times Read the eternities."" Or in this case watch not the times watch the eternities."
4,Possibly better than Series 1?,"Admittedly, I only watched these two series for the first time round just this year but I have vague recollections of my father watching it on repeats somewhere in the early 1980's.This second series is so much more comfortable in all senses especially from the performance of David Carradine. Each episode is a gem in itself that I will come back to again and again in future days. I have to say though that the re-apprearance of the blind preacher, Serenity, played by John Carradine in one of the latter episodes is my highlight. I have not yet purchased series 3 but I believe he crops up once again. So far, the overall impact of Kung Fu has been so rewarding and I will cherish these boxsets with great admiration."
4,Good but not Great,"I watched this show when it first came out and was excited when it came out in DVD. I liked the first season much better, but I still liked this one and will get season III soon.It is a nice balance of a desire to be non-violent, but not willing to allow bullies or those who abuse their power to have free reign over their fellow men."
1,It is only a map,"This is only a map of the USA with indications of the cities where x-files episodes ""happened"". And NOTHING else (well, something else - 3-line plot summaries of the first 3 seasons episodes, and some photos). If you are willing to spend money, get the books."
1,Not Worth It,"I really don't like it, as someone has pointed out, it's pretty much just a big map with the location of where the X-Files has once taken place. It's kind of pointless, and I felt that I wasted a lot of money on it. I thought it would be better, but I was disappointed."
1,Received Japanese copy,"I did not order a Japanese language copy. I had to pay shipping to return it because I missed the expiration by 2 days. Neglecting to examine the package closely when I receiveed it, I wasn't aware of the problem until I presented it as a birthday gift to my daughter. She pointed out the Japanese lettering.I'm disappointed because while I wait for an exchainge, my daughter is still waiting for her gift."
4,Better than Little Games,"If you liked the good songs on Little Games you'll love this. Alternate versions of ""Tinker Tailor,"" ""White Summer"" (this is missing from the Amazon track listing but it's there in full), and ""Glimpses"" (which reveals what the distorted voice in the background is saying); really good, high-fidelity live material from early 1967 just after Jeff Beck left (""Shapes of Things"" particularly benefits from Page's raunchiness); and 4 good unreleased songs from spring 1968 shortly before they stopped the band. Has a hidden Monster Magnet Tab-like experimental track 15 minutes into the last track. Come to think of it much of Tab sounded a lot like ""Glimpses."" Maybe this deserves five stars for having a video disk with it, but I haven't seen it. The music alone is super cool.If you've heard about Little Games but don't have it, get this first."
4,ATTENTION JIMMY PAGE FANS,"Play that Day-Glo Telecaster, Flower Jimmy! Here we have the psychedelic Yardbirds, led by future Led Zeppelin guitar hero Jimmy Page, running through an assortment of live and alternate studio tracks and demos. Since many of the songs are not of what would be considered finished quality, the emphasis here is on Jimmy's playing, which ranks amongst his very best non-Led Zep work. The CD has a good flow to it and every song offers something interesting. I would definitely recommend this CD for both ""Roger The Engineer"" era Yardbird fans and Zep fans alike. One complaint: Although ""Dazed And Confused"" is listed as approx. 25 minutes long, the song ends after 6 or so minutes, followed by 10 minutes of silence and then a hidden track (name escapes me - something about a lane) - strictly bong-hit material."
3,Mostly for Yardbirds Fans,"There have been rumors that this CD will be pulled from the market soon so if you are a Yardbirds fan, pick this one up quick. Several interesting tunes here including my favorite on the CD ""Avron Knows"". If your NOT a big Yardbirds fan start with something else like ""Roger The Engineer"" first.Or perhaps the latest recording by the group ""Reunion Jam"" from 1992. This one is pretty much for devotess of the group."
3,Not as good as I expexted.,"The one major flaw this book has, which someone else touched on was that the author does not thoroughly explain what is happening in the code. Being a VB developer, I still found myself scratching my head in some areas. Also, it is hard to tell if the errors in the code are intentional or typos. If you copy the code out of this book to the letter, your program will not work properly. For example on page 116 one line of code reads, ""If lstlayers.Count > 0 Then"". This code SHOULD be ""If lstlayers.Listcount > 0 Then"".Mistakes, or learning tools like this are very annoying, but seeing as my choices for a book on MapObjects is between this and another book, which has not faired too well in it's reviews, it will have to do. If you are new to Visual Basic, I suggest you learn the basics before delving into MapObjects...this book requires it, although it does attempt to show you very basic things."
3,No Alarm,"I bought this for my humidor and while it appears to work just fine, it actually has no alarm like the description says. There are cheaper digital hygrometers out there w/o alarms.Bonus: the english translation on the instruction sheet it humorous."
5,"TYR: Myth-Culture-Tradition, Vol. 1","I found TYR vol. 1 to be very interesting and educational, but it is not for the ""uninitiated"". The articles are in-depth and cerebral, and not written for an audience who has no prior knowledge of the subject matter. For those in the Germanic Ways community, this is a font of thought-provoking literature that will make you want more! I think this is a perfect example of the type of serious-minded literature that we need in the modern age to add to our ancient lore to help build the foundations of the resurging tribal faith of European man."
5,If Jackson only wrote for the Sopranos,"Think of how much fun that would be. I started reading Jackson when he first started and would catch back up to him every four or five years. So I am catching back up. It was great to see Grootka resurrected and so in character. This novel is a lot of fun with all the Jackson trademarks of character, Detroit life, music, etc. The only other writer in this genre who I think is as good as Jackson in similar ways (DC life and popular culture) is George Pelacanos. If you are new to this author don't start here. It pays to start at the beginning simply because it is more fun that way."
3,"""Starblazers"" light, worth seeing once...","If you are a fan of the old Starblazers show, then you will like this movie. It has all the same elements: a long space voyage, space battles and impossible technologies (a solar sail powered spaceship would be VERY slow and hard to steer).Even the animation looks similar. The real difference is that this movie is only about 90 minutes long while it would take a couple of weekends to watch all the Starblazers episodes. Odin is not great Anime but it is a nice diversion."
5,"this is a hardcore, non rap album","This album is intense and extremely, viciously angry and 8 or 9 of the 10 songs are faster than anything on urban discipline or any other biohazard album as a matter of fact. It is a pure hardcore album with no rapping in it. Although Urban discipline is obviously their best album they can ever make, this album is a lot rougher and more raw. Any old Biohazard fan will be very pleased, or maybe they will think Biohazard went too far with the raw sound and didn't experiment at all. I doubt that though. Who knows. Metallica has caused heavy metal fans to hate bands that experiment with their sound."
2,missed the the mark totally but they tried!?,trying to find their hardcore roots they missed by alot!it's better than the last few cds but means to an end is a grammy compared to this!sadly they thought heavy was D-tuned guitars and slower grooves and growling vocals but not by a mile.
2,Stay away!!,"I'll give it 2 stars cause it's BIOHAZARD, but this tuned down new metal sludge is just terrible!! At their best BIOHAZARD rules, this is a sad exception. Best song on the album is the title track ""kill or be killed"", with a pretty awesome break toward the end of the song. Actually that part alone almost makes the album worth listening. Check out ""Means to an end"" the last BIOHAZARD, its much much better!! This is BIOHAZARD's mistake record where similarly DIABOLIC in MUSICA is SLAYER'S mistake>>>!@!!!"
2,Good but not great...,"Biohazard have managed to step it up a bit after a few mediocre releases to hammer out an album that manages to feature a few ""classic"" Biohazard tracks among it's recent displays of all-style, no-substance. Killer tracks like ""Kill or Be Killed"" and ""Never Forget"" make this a worthy purchase for longtime fans and may bring a few new followers to the fold. Sadly, the CD is inconsistent and features many filler tunes that prevent this record from acheiving classic Biohazard status.This is the kind of CD longtime fans will enjoy but the corner has been painted..."
2,Biohazard overcome with hate,"Hi. I used to be a fan of this band.No more. Musically, this is as good as Biohazard gets. A read through the lyrics though, and it's nothing but reactionary racist hatred of Arabs. I wonder what people will think of this album once the anti-Arab sentiment of the US public subsides -- as I hope it will some day.You might call it ""angst"" or something but it's just simple-minded racism. Al-Quaeda is bad. Most Arabs are not supporters of Al-Quaeda, or at least they weren't. Maybe after hearing Biohazard they'll change their minds about the land of opportunity."
2,Too Annoying,"This CD is unlistenable to me. They will never top their 1994 effort, ""State of the World Address"", if this is the direction they're headed in. The low bellows of Evan and others are just too ""death metal"" sounding. Scrap the project, guys, and try to come up with something else next time. By the way, I saw them in Philly in 1995 where they opened for Slayer, and they got booed off stage."
1,A rip-off from a previous release,This album is a rip off. It is not NEW. It is just selections from the Palomino club recordings Jerry did back in the 80's. These recordings have been released a hundred times before. Your best bet is to buy the complete Palomino recordings from Amazon on the TOMATO LABEL. There are 42 tracks and you can get it for $19.95 used. Check it out as it is a 100% better buy.
5,A Vote for Murder- Murder she Wrote Book,I really enjoy the book. It's wonderful. I especially like that I can purchase the book and not go broke. The price for the book was excellent.I will continue buying these books.I would recommend this book to anyone that likes mysteries etc.
4,"A Vote For Murder: Murder, She Wrote",Always enjoy this series of books...look forward to the next one.
3,No proof at the end; only a bluff,"Like the other posters, I enjoy this series. But this volume falls short.It's very well written up to the end, but then -- when Jessica calls everyone together to reveal the murderer -- she has no proof at all.In the other books in this series she usually catches the murderer in something that he said or did. But here she has no such proof, so she only bluffs, and the murderer immediately confesses.Enjoyable, but not up to the usual high standard in this series."
4,Dense,"Readers Beware: Rorty is not an easy read. However, if one is willing to take up the challenge, a reader will be rewarded with thoughtful analysis of where America finds itself in the present moment. Rorty may have been one of the greatest philosophers of the second half of the 20th Century. This book shows why."
4,A Serious and Interesting Read,"While the author does point the finger of this lack in national pride at the New Left (partly), he also points fingers at American society as a whole, for not having the pride necessary of America's successes. American bashing is just as dangerous as blind patriotism. Rorty is not calling for nationalism, but national pride. He reminds us that to do that, we must first accept ourselves and our nation--good and bad. Do yourself a favor, and pick up this book. Everyone will get something out of reading it."
2,Good overview of countersurveillance techniques,The book offers a cursory examination of technical surveillance countermeasures (TSCM) that will likely interest those with no technical or electronic know-how. Offers no practical or theoretical information.
4,It's good for beginners,"Everyone knows our rights are shrinking everyday that goes by. Add to this the problem of nosey neighbors, landlords, or an over enthusiastic law enforcement agency and you have a bug problem.This book covers many of the basic aspects of these hidden bugs and cameras, and goes foward from there to indepth detail about these devices work and how to beat them. This Book is set up as a basic manual for starting a debugging business."
3,A Double Dip of Domination!,"Winslow serves up a tasty double dip of domination--with some intriguing twists--in these two novellas. If the concept of remote-control orgasms appeals to you, or if collecting women who adore you and perform at your bidding is a favorite fantasy, these stories are for you!"
1,"Forget literature, this one's Penthouse Forum all the way...","If you are looking for quality erotica, take my advice and pass on this one. The stories are loosely constructed excuses for bump and grind sex scenes. Character development is a foreign concept for this author, and plot is apparantly a waste of time. Considering that this is intended to be hot fiction, I was intensely disappointed, and ended up skimming through all of Nathan's Cirlce, the first novella, in search of something stimulating.I suppose if all you require is a graphic depiction of clothes tearing, overwhelmed by lust sex scenes, you'll be very happy with this book. But if you enjoy a bit more realism, emotion, and character involvement, you'll be as disappointed as I was.This book is clearly written by an emotionally immature man, and may find some fans in men of a similar disposition. Women will likely be left unfazed by this one."
1,Mini Box Fan,The fans were used and had dust allover both of them. The wires were cut off and I could not test and see if they even worked! Don't buy from this vendor. The fans were 110VAC type.Mini Box Fan - AC
2,Cheaper and cheaper,"Length:: 1:22 MinsI meant $80 per 2000. But in short, they really have decreased their quality. One thing I forgot to mention in the video is that the rubber grip is no longer there so if it gets a little heavy it could be a little annoying."
5,Compact and useful,I bought this to place in my ATV Plano rear box and all of my winch attachments fit in perfectly and keeps them in one easy compartment. I actually went back and bought another for my ammo the first one did so good.
4,Nice box,"This box is exactly what I was looking for.There is plenty of room in the bottom, and if you need more room you can always remove the pull-out tray.This is great for ammo storage. I've seen other ammo boxes with round rubber gaskets forced onto the rectangular boxes, but this gasket was formed to the box. Well done!Mine did not come with a rubberized handle. They probably quit doing that to keep these things so cheap."
4,Got what I expected,This product was what I expected. It is good for storing ammo and a few items in the tray for going to the range. I would have given 5 stars if I would have received a better deal.
3,"Small, and ugly","This box was smaller then I had imagined it would be. It is also the ugliest plastic box I have ever seen. It looks like it has been sitting outside in the weather for 100 years. It functions good, and seems strong. If you don't care about looks and if you are sure the dimensions work for you. Then buy this box. If not look elsewhere."
5,Provides an excellent overview for intermediate students,This fine chess book approaches tactics in the best way I have ever seen. Each tactical idea is introduced and built on using progressive examples both from the attacker's and defender's point of view. I highly recommend it for any player over USCF 1000 rating
3,Good Book but...,"This book gets 3 stars from me only because I am a USCF rated class B tournament player. I think this book is good for the class C player and definitely good for the class D and below player. It is simple, to the point, and user friendly. Class B players and above, stay away. Oh, do not pay over $20 dollars for this book even if it is brand new. It can be obtained through USCF."
3,Good but not great.,Ok product...I got it during a promotion so I got it at a discount. If I had to pay full rate for it I would have been dissapointed with it.
3,For Scholars,"A very scholastic book. For me the most interesting part was on the religious practices in Scotland. The least interesting was the chapter on St Maggie as I never got a feel for her personality, what it was like to be around her."
1,Riddled with mistakes,"I'm sure some good things must be said about Dr. Choudhry's book. However, the book is riddled with mistakes, errors anbd mis-spellings. It is an unreliable source. I am personally upset I spent so much money and I can't trust a single word it says.Next time, please proof read your books."
1,bad book description,"Potential readers should know that this book isn't a scholastic history of Robert E. Lee. Like Dwyer's ""Stonewall,"" this book is historical fiction. Furthermore, interposed within its ""story,"" is ultra-conservative-Texan-Christian rhetoric... I'm shocked that Amazon.com doesn't state this in the book description."
4,Great Pictures and Lots of information,This book had great action pictures of Cujo. I really liked the tips Cujo gave for younger players to help them to improve their game. I also thought Curtis Joesph's schedule at the end of the book was neat too. Anyone who likes Cujo or the Toronto Maple Leafs should get this book.
2,"It's fun to see the reviewers split, so here I am","I've read all three of Crow's novels about Luther Ewing. I liked Red Rain a lot. I liked The Bite, but a lot less. No Way Back probably describes Crow's predicament as well as it does Ewing's. There's no place to go with this series or this character any more. Luther started out complex and 3-dimensional, which is what made the series so promising. Now he, and all of the other characters (caricatures?), are right out of a comic book, 2-dimensional at best, and with apologies to the author, boring. The same goes for the plot. I'm with the 2-star reviewer at best. The sad part is this is a 2-star book from a 4 star writer.For an alternative, tryThe Empanada Affair."
2,Does Not Live Up to the Hype,"Plodding, boring and disjointed. Plot lacks credibility and unfolds at an excruciatingly slow pace."
5,Best RPG Ever!,"This is definately the best rpg ever made! i like it a lot more than any of the Final Fantasy games, defintely. Buy this game if you are able to find it!"
5,Greatest RPG in Years!,"I am a huge RPG fan and have been playing them for about 5 years now. This game is really great. The graphics are extraordinary, the story is mind-blowing, and how everything fits together makes the game almost *PERFECT*. Its major ""rival"" at the moment is Grandia II but I have played both and I definitely think Skies of Arcadia is better. If you love RPGs and want one of the greatest games ever made this is definitely for you!"
5,This is why you should by Skies of Arcadia!,"This is a great game when i first started this game i was at an aw playing it wtih its great graphics. It had all of what is needed in a great RPG backstabing, battels, bosses, great plot, and lots of members to your party. There was a new add feature to this RPG the arial battels (which means air ship to air ship) when i had my first ship battel i was stunned that the graphics were still wonderful. Also as soon as i began i was hook in with over 50 hours playing time in! This was the first game i beat for the DC and i hope that it goes to the PS2 or at least part 2."
5,Skies of Arcadia Vs. Grandia II,"Trying to decide between Skies of Arcadia and Grandia II? While neither has a clear advantage over the other, it's Arcadia that comes out slightly on top. While Grandia boasts a vastly superior battle engine, Arcadia's depth of play is what distinguishes it from the competition. There are several side quests to complete, and the ability to fight ship-to-ship battles make for a very enjoyable experience. So...Pick up Arcadia, but save some money for Grandia II ;-)"
4,What could've saved Dreamcast had it came out sooner,"Great game. Decent challenge, excellent storyline. very good battle system that is easy to use. Airship battles were excellent, but could've been a bit harder in the later parts of the game. Overall, excellent buy for any RPGer."
5,MY FAVORITE GAME!,"first of all let me tell u that i've played a lot of RPG's and the Skies of Arcadia seris is the best.Join a boy named Vyse and his friends aika and fina as they battle monsters,find treasures,discover new continents, explore mystical ruins and even recruite 22 members for their own ship, even fight piratesIf you're a RPG fan you'll luv this game.There is a full 3D world with a highly imaginative storyline,great graphics and immersive gameplay.There's even hand to hand combat and ship to ship combat with special effects and special attacks.An RPG like no other awaits u!.U won't be sry if u buy it!"
5,What RPGs were always meant to be!,"Near perfection. It's actually hard to say how good Skies of Arcadia is, but here's my advice: if you like RPGs and have a Dreamcast, then you MUST buy this game!!! (and Shenmue too)"
4,Love 80's Music,"It was fun seeing these two again on A&E ""The Two Coreys"". This soundtrack is very good!"
4,Great sound track,"This really is a really good soundtrack. Sadly, it's missing Blue Future's song ""Where is She"" If it had had that, it would've been the best out there!"
5,Butt kickin,I have had my hands on this CD twice and someone always takes it. This is a great CD to put on if you have to clean your room or jumpstart a heart.
3,Loses Steam,"I really liked the first book, it was inventive, had pretty good characterization and made you want to know what was going to happen. It was predictable at the end, but you liked the characters and wanted to know what their fate turned out to be. Again, some very creatice ideas.Book two reads as if it is written by a different author. Same characters, a little bit of creativity but to me, very different. It was very unusual to be reading about people you think you know who turn out to be strangers.First book - 4 or five stars, second book - one or two stars. If possible try to find book one, read it and enjoy. Don't ruin a good thing by reading book two"
4,Very Good Read,"I don't review many books, though I read many. I thought I would chime in on this one as so few have done so. This is a very good series that has interesting characters and a very interesting world construction. While some of the concepts, the ""Stargates"" are not all that new the sum is far better than the parts. I enjoyed it so much that I reread it several times which for me is about as strong an endorsement that I can give."
4,Name Changes,"This is the first two books of a trilogy. When first published the author was Dave Wolverton: several excellent books were published under that name. The last book of the trilogy is ""Lords of the Seventh Swarm."" I really liked this series, but I do not understand why the last book was left out of this edition."
1,Oh my God.,"Is this what The Power Rangers have become? This is like the latest season and the crappiest ever. They used to be so cool in the early 90's and now it sucks so bad.Let's take a look at the episodes.Calm before the Storm: Stupid clip show. It's a freakin' clip show, but they still manage to make it 20 minutes.End of Time: The crappiest ending to any show ever.If I could rate it 0 stars, I would."
4,Does A Good Job Given The Price,This is the first rice cooker I've ever owned. A friend recommended it who also has it. Does a really good job assuming you follow the instructions which suggest you pre-soak the rice. This produces good white or brown rice in about 25 minutes. I have experienced no burning. It also does a great job on steamed veggies as well as steamed seafood. Clean-up is easy as is storage. I've been using this more than I originally anticipated as it produces a nice meal in tandem with the steamer insert. I bought a rice steamer cookbook so I have been finding this appliance versatile in regard to various cooking options.
4,Everyday rice cooker!,"If you cook rice everyday and you need it done fast. This rice cooker is for you. Everything done in 30 minutes. Not the best, but good for everyday use."
3,Water boils over and comes out the top,This rice cooker is alright but when making brown rice the water always boils over and comes out the top part. I tried making a really small amount (like one or one and a half cups) and it still did it. It gets really messy.
2,spewing all over,I spent time selecting this product as I had another of great performance. I have had to clean up the counter after every use as it spews rice mist all over. The steam hole has been examined and appears ok but the problem continues. Disappointing.
1,just cannot take it,"i probably need this cd a lot--but i just cannot listen. there is a sound in the background that sounds to me like a fire alarm. i just cannot take it. if you are sensitive to noises, save your $$ and buy ""your present: a half hour of peace"" instead, because you cannot return cds once they've been opened. agghhh! this cd had the opposite effect on me--it induced more tension!"
5,Soothing and effective,This CD really surprised me. I find it engaging and effective. It really helps me after a stressful day or to fall asleep on nights I have trouble. The audio quality of this CD is very good. I especially like the tones he uses during the hypnosis.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,the pin is not properly secured to the body of the pitter. after a few uses it will pop off. i've gone through three of these pitters from my local linens 'n things. how could the designers be so inept?
1,breaks immediately,"As others have commented, very poor workmanship. The first pitter I had lost the pin on its third pitting round. Hammered it back in but didn't last. The next season I needed one quickly but couldn't find a different one, so bought it again. The pin was lost during the first use. I have no idea why all local stores seem to carry just this pitter."
3,James is right--bad design!,"I agree with james--the metal pin comes detached from the pitter and it will stick in a cherry every two or three times you pit one. And there is no food-grade metal glue available to fix the problem, to our knowledge. Try another product!"
2,Was great for a while,I'm looking for a new olive/cherry pitter because mine has suffered the same fate as others mentioned here - the pin keeps falling out. I'm giving 2 stars rather than 1 because I've used it for a couple of years and all was fine until a few months ago. I've tried hammering the pin back in many times and it just shoots out again or gets stuck in the fruit. Feels nice and solid when new but I expected a metal tool to have a longer life.
3,Thoroughly disappointing,"The books in this series are probably the best single volume sources on these aircraft in English. As such they are almost indispensible. Unfortunately, they contain none of the excellent color profiles of the original Aircam volumes of which these are reprints. They are not even reprints; they are copies. These volumes even include the black-and-whiteplan views that refer back to the color section, now useless, as there is no color section.Moreover, the original Aircam volumes can often be had on Ebay, and at less cost. The books in this series could have been superb, as they are, merely disappointing."
5,Awesome product.,"This has always been one of my favorite flavors of meal replacement bars, and for the price, you cant go wrong. Definitely recommend. Delivery was quick."
2,More like candy than a health bar,"These taste good. Like candy, including high fructose corn syrup... so 5 stars for taste.But, these are suppose to be ""health"" bars.I asked my wife, who's studying to be a nutritionist and she was not impressed with the ingredients and amount of sugar.So, for a ""health"" bar, I'm giving this 2 stars. If you just want taste though, then you'll be pleased."
5,SuperCookieCrunch!,"Delicious, not just delicious, fantstically priced. I buy these bars periodically, and of every vendors Amazon had the best price, the bars are the exact same thing as I've been ordering from all these other vendors at a higher price. Love the bars, great for a breakfast when I'm running late, Best tasting protien/meal replacement bar on the market. Buy IT"
1,Waste of money,A quick look at the ingredients should tell you these are NOT really good for you. But if you are suffering from constipation these should do the trick as you will have to run to the bathroom within 30 minutes of consuming. This is do to the sugar alcohols that are produced in the bar. (check the warning on the back). You're better off eating a Snickers with these bars at 410 calories a pop
2,sugar cakes,"This baffles me. They call it a ""meal replacement"" bar, but there's enough sugar in these to make a big wedding cake. This isn't a meal replacment bar. It's an appetizer with 50 table spoons of sugar. So you get a little protein and enough sugar to ruin any health benefits."
4,tasty,These protein bars have a Great taste and plenty of calories and with 32 grams of protein it is great for meal replacement.
3,not bad,"good as a meal replacement, a meal that keep you in shape, I dont like the taste for ( met rx super cookie crunch ), not too bad taste, but I did not like the taste, too much sugar ."
3,Too much sugar,I bought this because it was on sale. It certainly has a lot of protein but it is much too sweet (26g sugar) and has too many calories. I have to work out extra hard to make these worth it.
2,Sugar in a noisy bag,"Incredibly rich and tasty! Lists lots of protein, so that's good. But, watch out for sugar overload! Why it has to contain so many grams of sugar -- for a health bar -- is beyond me. 25 grams of sugar in the Cookie Crunch! OMdiabetes! To my knowledge, all the Colossal protein bars have extremely high sugar levels. The wrapper is super noisy; try handling one in the quietness of your home without waking up or disturbing someone...forget it. Again, on the plus side the bar is really tasty and alleges high protein; on the down side, sugar quantity is sky high and the wrapper is really noisy."
4,Protein bar or Indulgent snack?,"OK, I eat a lot of these things, among various other flavors. I am also a big fan of the meal replacement powders and consume 2 of each of the aforementioned per day; 2 bars, 2 shakes. This adds a lot of calories and protein to the daily diet...This bar, ""Super Cookie Crunch"", is sweet; more like a cookie than a candy bar. It has a satisfying texture and the taste is like something you'd find in the snack aisle. Don't eat with sweet beverages or with other sweet foods unless you are either looking for a sugar overload or are part insect. I'm not arguing exact sugar content here; I'm talking about real-world, coating-your-tongue sweetness. These have it.They can be a bit of a gut bomb, though; make sure you drink plenty of water!I would rate them @5 stars but I like some other flavors better (crispy apple pie!), so this score is comparative and not based strictly on it's own merits.Enjoy!"
3,Hard to chew,"I find it very hard to chew. If you love those heavy brownies probably you'll like it. I'm more into lighter (in consistency), like the fruit ones.My favorite flavor is the apple pie. Much easier to chew and tastes better (and more natural) than this one."
4,Beware,"While these things taste awesome, i cannot use them as a complete meal replacement because its not filling enough. Those of you who intend to have these as a snack must know how high in calories they are. so if you have a little snack here or a little snake there, it adds up.Again, great taste, but beware of the snack bug. you must be discipline"
3,when they ship its great,"so my 1 24 came and went 2 suscribe and save not shipped, and all they could say was ,,,no order, it took a week to make them understand when you don't ship i get zip"
5,Amazing Taste!,"Best protien bar you will ever have! I eat these all the time, mostly for breakfast to replace the sugary cereals and because they are quick and easy. The taste alone is amazing even if you dont need the protien"
5,Big on Taste and Just Big,These are a great meal replacement bar. They are huge and pack a lot of flavor in that size. The texture is a bit odd but not necessarily in a bad way.
5,Best tasting bars on the market,"I bought these bars because of the high protein content and the taste is really good. I used to watch Met-Rx world's strongest man (until cable networks decided to no longer air the episodes in the US) and that was how I discovered their products. I decided to give them a try and I'm glad I did. Unlike other protein bars I've tried, these are not hard to chew. You can use these as a meal replacement bar for lunch or dinner, or you can do like me and eat these ""between"" meals to increase your protein intake. It's been a few years since I've been taking these and I will continue to buy them because, well, they're just that good."
5,D-licious.,"Holy moly, this tastes so good. I would rather eat one of these instead of most candy bars. It's better for you - less sugar and empty calories and this thing is big. Most candy bars are gone in about 4 bites. On the other hand, this thing took me a good ten bites before it was gone. Plus, it's crunch AND chewy so there's plenty to chew and enjoy. If you like eating, that means MORE FUN. Love it."
5,Be reasonable as these are protein and not junk food!,Have one with a glass of milk. Like big thick Oreos. It is protein and not junk food.
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this book due to the need for information on a Table. The paperback arrived promptly but with no Tables in the back. Then I read at the very end of the ""Acknowledgments"": ""Readers of the paperback edition are advised to consult the clothbound edition for the Dependence Tables and Wage Tables that form much of the documentary basis for chapters three and four."" I should have been advised that the book I was ordering, the Paperback edition, did not contain the very information I need."
2,Do Not Expect Any Inspiration From Mr. Segel,"I could picture Mr. Segel and Mr. Shay sitting around a table one evening (alright, maybe two) as they jotted down whatever thoughts that came to mind, no matter how trivial or irrelevant those thoughts were and inserted them in their manuscript. To say that both authors have a knack for stating the obvious would be an understatement. The 47 pages they spent on Trade Shows was absolutely amateurish. For example, strategy 154 - ""Dress in a Costume."" Being the clown of the booth is probably not such a great idea unless you're at a circus. Moreover, when was the last time you heard a buyer say ""I hated their line, but the M&M's were great."""
1,the six million dollar man bombs at the movies,"i'm not sure if we are to take this mess as drama, action, comedy, or just the junk it is. the ""plot about a world where cars are outlawed to ""enslave"" the masses is never given even a remote bit of believeable grounding. the movie then throws in a pilot from the korean war played by the great burgess merideth as the way the goverment tries to stop majors who just happens to be a former race driver who has the last working car and a pump to pull gas left in the bottom of old gas tanks and is running from the goverment to ""free califorina"" and freedom, . they give this hundred year old man a jet and tell him to kill majors. the fact he doesen't is just silly. this one must have been the nail in majors film life. just junk not worth the time it takes to watch. think about it have you ever heard of it being out at the theaters."
2,could have been more helpful,"Found some data in the book, that seemed incorrect. No more words, not interested writing any more on the subject."
3,Survival guide for bipolar,"All of that information I already obtain throu the Internet saits. The book was nothing to do about reality of surviving-only main information about desease and main information (very old, thouh, it is another level of medicine already exist , for exsample, abilify). Nothing new for me, mother of bipolar child, who declines her medical help. Again, nothing about SURVIVING. Sorry, Natalia Seregin."
3,Surviving the Manic Depression Book,"While it has a lot of information on the disease, and describes the different medications in detail, it is a real snoozer. I would have rated it a 1 but it did serve one purpose: it helped cure those insomnia episodes that come with acute mania."
2,Coffee Table Philosophy,"""Country and Modern"" has some stunning photos in it and some rather heavy-handed philosophy about the responsibility of connecting with your environs via design, etc. If you're designing a home in a non-urban setting and want to do a lot of thinking about these connections, it might be useful.Many photos emphasizing the ""benign neglect"" design principle -- so if you're up for trying to pull off an interior using weathered siding, a plain worn chair, and an apple, you may find some inspiration here."
1,"Too Shabby, not enough Chic","Shabby Chic is the antithesis of modernism and this book tries (but fails) to bring the two styles together. The text is sparse and the photos are in some cases too small and lack significance to the overall concept of the book. The contrast of modernism versus country style was just too obvious in my opinion. The subtle minimalist styling of many rooms was bowled over by the rustic colors and textures. The combination makes the rooms uncomfortable to both modernists and traditionalist alike. If you want an inspiring decor book, try ""White Hot"" by Tricia Guild. It explores many of the same ideas through color, texture and nature. As for ""Country and Modern"", I returned it."
3,You can't be serious,"I'm just going to say, brother, you can't be serious! Who is going to purchase a Kindle book at such a ridiculous price? I'm sure the texts are valuable...yeah, the ORIGINALS, maybe. I might have found them quite interesting, but with such an exorbitant price tag, I'm sure myself and most other readers will never download it. I noticed other Kindle publications by the same editor have the same outlandish cost. What the heck?!?!"
1,my poor toes,This shoe has made my big toes cry out in pain. I wore them for two days at work several weeks ago and my toes are still hurting. It is all in the cut of the front of the shoe - it seems to become more narrow too soon. This is funny to me because I wear AAA width shoes and these were too narrow for my toes (wore their regular width shoe)!!!! They are the worst.
3,my opinion,"even though she said doll was never opened, it was. I always inspect Barbies from head to toe and when there is a lot of tape on box, I know it has been opened. I wish people would be a little more honest about what they are selling."
5,Boys Batman pajamas,"Very soft, smooth, light and pleasant to touch fabric. My son enjoys his ""Batman"" pajamas."
5,"Nice, Modern Little Tray","I purchased this tray because I was looking for something simple and modern to sit on the counter of my master bathroom and provide a home for various toiletries that otherwise tend to get scattered about. I was worried it may not hold up to the water and chemicals used in the bathroom, but several months later it looks the same as when it was purchased."
5,NATALIE! NATALIE! NATALIE! A TRUE CLASSIC!,"It is just a quiet little 60's film that can't be beat! the always amazing NATALIE WOOD is simply brilliant and proves once again that an actor does not need to chew up the scenery ranting and raving to turn in a stellar performance...I SIMPLY ADORE NATALIE, always have, always will and this film along with ""This Property is Condemned"" are my favorites!...I love this film so much that the 3 sheet French poster of it is the last thing I see when I fall asleep!...it hangs over my bed...don't miss this film and by the way... WHERE IS THE DVD and CD soundtrack?!?!...with all the trash they are churning out on DVD and CD why not try something different?...a truly wonderful film like this one?"
4,And Still They Shine,"Should you ever need to describe the essential of good chemistry between two actors, point them to Woods and McQueen in this film. If you seek a film that captures the glorious grit of New York City locales rather than the glitz - this film. It you like romance reflective of life's harsh realities . . . . How marvelous to view these two actors rise like stars to the level of this film, surpass it, but then reach back to pull the film up to their level. Rise, indeed. Like the stars they were. And still they shine."
1,My experience,This was advertised as cover in good condition and movie plays well. cover was not in good condition and movie ha lines thru it and does not play well.
1,"not only boring, but also depressing!","Let's get one thing straight: I love Steve McQueen. I never thought any movie with Steve McQueen could be all bad, but this one proved me wrong. I didn't find either of these characters charming or interesting, and I didn't sense any chemistry between them, either. And the whole abortion plot was such a downer, I couldn't even finish the movie (even though I was curious as to how they were going to get out of it, since she was walking into the office when I turned it off--that tells you how emotionally involving the story was). And Steve McQueen as an Italian? I might have believed it if he'd looked anything remotely like the people playing his parents (or anyone else in the movie). The best part was the scene with Tom Bosley. It was the only sweet thing in the whole movie."
5,A DVD must,"Both Wood and Mcqueen are at their absolute best in this love story that translates into any era. Why do we have to wait for movies of this calibre to appear on DVD, when the studies release so much rubbish that nobody wants.Mike Lewis-Hart. Australia"
5,A Perfect Film!,"This film is truly a gem! Without giving anything away for those who haven't seen it yet: the pivotal scene in the squalid apartment is worth the price of the VHS! In this scene,Natalie Wood will take your breath away! The silent terror in her eyes is unforgettable! She is magnificent in a role that should have won her the Oscar! I've read so many reviews of older films including this one that criticizes the stories as being dated. This is nonsense! We must always remember the year it was filmed and judge it on it's merits. Saying this, I must add, Where is the DVD?"
5,I LOVE IT!,"i haven't taken many yoga classes, but i love this one. it's very empowering and challenging. i;d recommend this to anyone, but i must admit, you kinda have to be in shape to get through this one."
5,This is an awesome DVD,"I own many yoga DVD's. I had Navel Power for several weeks before I finally tried it this weekend. It is without a doubt, one of the BEST home workouts I own. I think Ana and Ravi are great and so are the exercises. I really feel a good burn in my abdominals and even if I do just one of the half hour sets, I still get a great workout. My wrists are weak and most yoga routines (with lots of downdogs) do not work for me so the Navel Power routine is perfect.This is a workout that I will continue to use."
2,Not for me.,"I gave it the good ol' college try, but ""the breathe of fire"" just wasn't for me. I like less traditional, ""happy"" yoga, but this work out felt like hyperventilating while having a seizure."
3,What they don't show...,"What they don't show: Anna getting adjusted by the chiropractor after the work out. Tough work out, even if you have strong abs, but really watch the lower back!"
4,Anna Kavan's Classic work,"If you have ever enjoyed Kavan's work, this book is a must read.If you own any of her work, this is a must buy."
3,Just okay,"I purchased this product and used it regularly - it lasted for several months. Honestly, I didn't see much of a difference between this product and eye treatments that can be purchased at the drug store. I'm not sure I'll purchase this again.....certainly it's good to buy and try once, but I'm not ""WOW'ed"" enough to want to purchase it again."
1,DeWalt Belt Sander,"Purchased a DeWalt DW432 belt sander as a ""factory"" reconditioned model.The sander was received damaged. Packaged very poorly at ship point. Finally after buying additional parts to repair used the sander a few times then the motor burned up. Total waste of time and money."
4,Black light,"Thank you very much.Although,in DVD format,the picture quality is excellent.Iespecially like the suspese this film portrayed.This B movie should be given a4 star.Again thank you."
1,Rehashed trash from a has-been ! ! !,"Not again! This is about the 5th time that Benny has attempted to re-record his old ""hits"" (again), with each new recording being worse than the previous. Listen, either get the rights to the original songs and put out the actual albums on cd, or put out a greatest hits cd with the original versions on it. This guy has been milking his popularity in several regional areas (I'm from central New York) for the last 20 years or so, and the guy looks like a sad version of Elvis in the mid-70's. He's a singer who had promise 20 years back, but screwed up his career with bad business deals and substance abuse. Now he is the stereotypical lounge singer, appearing for Christmas shows each year in the central New York area! Enough already! Either re-release the originals or give it up!!!!!! This album is awful !"
1,Slashers don't get any worse than this,"Oh boy...how could anyone invest money in this...thing? In the wake of the slasher boom in the late seventies and entire eighties, every one wanted to captalize on the bloody frenzy and it results in atrocities such as this (history DOES repeat itself). Not everyone is Dario Argento, John Carpenter, or George Romero. It seems some directors like to think they are. The acting is laughable and there is no conceivable plot. I won't give away the ending..if you want to call it that, but believe me, you'll feel like you just wasted nearly two hours of your life and a few bucks that could have been put to much better use. I can see how the writer might have thought the ending would be cool, but it seems to me that they were too lazy or inept to orchestra a better climax. Dont say i didnt warn you."
4,"Varied, textured, resonant short works by a favorite author","I do like Fowles's novels, but I agree with the Amsterdam reader, this is a chance to get a distilled version of his charm: all the pleasure of his intelligent plotting and dialogue, without the excesses a novel will allow. I love the way the various stories resonate with each other in obvious and subtle ways--in that, it reminded me of Julian Barnes's _The History of the World in 10 and a 1/2 Chapters_ (another short story collection I loved)."
2,A bad day at the office,"I love it when famous authors have an off day. It gives us unpublished writers hope. I mean, if this kind of crap can get published, then surely we stand a good chance.Eliduc is a sweet translation of a mediaeval morality tale. Okay.The other four strike me as having started out as novels, then Fowles ran out of steam when he realised that the premise couldn't bear the weight of a full-length treatment. In computer terms, it's as if these stories were in the recycle bin but Fowles didn't want to kill his ""children"" so he did some cosmetic work to try and rescue them from oblivion.Dialogue: appalling. Punctuation: enough commas semis and colons to stock three books.I liked The Collector. The Magus is fascinating. You'd imagine that a writer of Fowles's ability and renown would want to bury this book where nobody could ever read it."
3,"Mildly absorbing pieces, but what are they doing together?","Four novella slices for sandwichA French tale added to make it richBodies tease and eludeMinds show up in the nudeThere's one boring piece, won't tell you which"
5,Excellent guide to the Alps,"I have read several travel books in preparation for a family trip to France next year. This one has been the most helpful. It has hundreds of wonderful pictures which bring the region to life and lots of information on local events and attractions. Want to visit a local pottery? A local woodcrafter? Attend a festival or tour a five hundred year old abbey? What are some great hiking or cycling routes in various towns? This is the sort of information at which this guide excels. It provides information on hotels and restaurants but does not devote as much space to such topics. They seem willing to concede such matters to Michelin, Frommers et al."
2,Not for the general public,"Bawden is often quoted for his archaelogical studies of the North of Peru, so I bought his book in advance of my tourist trip to the Moche sites, of which I knew next to nothing. I spent many disappointing hours trying to study this book but I was not able even to finish it. The book is terribly dry and while it is not strictly limited to a list of archeological finds, that is clearly the forte of the author. The style is way more awkward than the average scholarly text, the photos of which there are many are absolutely substandard (this must be the fault of the printer). But more substantially, I came out of my struggle with this book without even a half way understanding of what distinguished the Moche from the previous civilizations, from the contemporary ones, and from those that followed it. If you are serious in wanting to study the Moche, I am sure that this could be a useful addition to your text list, but if you want to read just one book, choose something else."
2,Muslim personalities (pre-1950),"(from another's review): ""Short essays, including: An account of the modern Khalifat, How Islam came to western Sudan, Studies in exploration and history, African and Islamic, Islamic Conquest, Akbar, Katsina, Bornu, Fall of Constantinople, the great schism of Islam. Dedicated to the people of Katsina province."" Rather simplistic, brief sketches, no extensive analysis, stale-dated by 2000."
5,A great starting point for newcomers into Sentimiento's music,"Sentimiento Muerto easily ranks as the best rock band to ever come out of Venezuela. This compilation gathers the best of their label work. There is another album (""Aunque Usted No Lo Quiera"") which compiles some of their more 'underground' earlier material. Both of them complement each other very well in documenting a band that blended in rock, punk and ska in a way that made them legendary among music fans in Venezuela. You only need to hear ""Sin Sombra No Hay Luz"" or ""Manos Frias"" to realize that this was a great band that you can now only miss and dig back to rediscover. For more details about the band, visit the blog I have put together about them: http://sentimiento-muerto.blogspot.com."
2,NOT Middle Eastern,"I bought htis cd along with its two companion sets to expand my world music selection. Some of the tracks are very good, but they simply are not Middle Eastern. Surprisingly all three cd sets have the same type of music on them. But one is supposed to be Middle eastern, one Punjabi and one some other Eastern type of music.I lived in Europe and loved the music in the Moroccan restaurants and clubs or the Turkish bars in Budapest. I really wish I would have had the foresight to buy those cds when I was there.The music's sound is off if you know what real Middle Eastern music sounds like and you can tell alot of these tracks and hastily thrown together becasue they are so mind numbingly repetative"
5,What an awesome toy!,"We purchased this item for our son for Christmas and it has been his favorite toy. It is so cute - the intercom system is is favorite and it just keeps him busy for hours. The light and sound system is very authentic and he just loves this thing. Ours came with a costume which is quite cute and definitely a photo opportunity. Don't pass this one by if you have a firetruck lover in your family. Our toddler is only 2.5, and the parts really aren't that small to worry about it."
3,Cute Toy--Not Worth the Money,"My son loves firetrucks so we HAD to get him this one. He loves it and thinks it's the greatest thing. I, however, cannot share his enthusiasm. The electronics are not designed very well. First, when you press the siren button the horn sounds and vice versa. Second, when the truck is not in use, we need to unscrew the plate that holds the batteries and loosen one battery because it constantly ""chirps"" and makes noise. Third, the springs in the battery compartment aren't tight so that you have to hold them to get them to make proper contact with the battery as you're putting the battery in. That may explain why another reviewer has trouble with the battery coming loose over a bump. All in all, it's a cute toy that toddlers will love, but as far as I'm concerned it's not worth the money because of all the hassles."
1,Beware of FeeNix products,"Please beware of buying any FeeNix products. They are made with cheap plastic parts that break with little use. When you try to buy spare parts, you will find out that none are available. Grandparents bought our children the pedal fire truck for Christmas 2008. It was used for less than one year before the steering linkage broke, rendering the whole thing useless. Thanks FeeNix."
2,"Great toy, not very durable","We have this toy for only 2 weeks and it has been used about 6 times. Already the front wheel has snapped off the axel and is no longer working. It is now completely unusuable. In hindsight i would not have purchased something this price from an unheard of manufacturer since it is just not durable enough for a 3 yr old, nor as big as i thought. Unfortunately my son loves it and will miss it if we do not replace it. We are still waiting to hear from the manufacturuer as to a solution."
5,Gotta Dance!,"How can you dance when/Spring is in your shoes?/Dance like the king/of the kangaroos. Bounce, bounce, bou---ce.... How can you dance when/there's something in your way?/Dance like a crab/on a sunny day. Side-step-side, look around.... Rick Walton and Ana Lopez-Escriva have authored a marvelous picture book that will have kids up and moving and imaginations soaring. Each two page spread asks a how can you dance question in lilting rhyming text and then helps youngsters begin their own dance with helpful instructions and bold, expressive artwork. This is a terrific book for pre-schoolers full of energy and the movement ideas suggested are just the tip of the iceberg. Young children will be creating their own dances in no time. So find out how you can dance with a stick in your hand, or when one foot is sore or even when you're mad as a bee and have fun."
4,A solid attempt at softcore comedy...... I give it a B,"The sex scenes were plentiful; in fact, I'm surprised they were able to fit so many into a 75-minute movie. Lezley Zen makes an appearance toward the middle, having a wild time in the back of a pickup truck. Once Tiko gets to the house and finds Sharon and Cynthia, a three-way just had to follow. For the most part, the scenes were quit realistic, with Lezley's and the three-way standing out as the winners."
2,Detailed but boring account of the great one's life and music,"Bob Dylan would be one of the most difficult subjects for a biography you could think of. His enigmatic statements and constant reinvention make him hard to pin down - not to mention the way he protects his privacy, giving few revealing interviews. Heylin attempts to make up for this by describing lots of often irrelevant details but never succeeds in giving you a sense of the man or his music. Heylin declines to make his own analysis of Dylan's music, perhaps feeling too scared he would make a fool of himself if he did. After a while it just becomes boring. Oh and what a terrible title."
2,Tiresome,"I find it surprising that so many reviewers seem so delighted with Mr. Heylin's book. While I did enjoy learning bits about the origins of songs and Dylan's studio methods, I found that for the most part Mr.Heylin was falling over himself to express just how much he dislikes everyone in Dylan's life with the exception of the man himself.For most of the book, Heylin treats Dylan like a talented golden boy, whose personal habits he finds highly distasteful, but is willing to overlook. But by the end of the book, I think maybe he has spent just a little bit too much time in his room thinking about Bob Dylan, and is clearly quite tired of him.800 pages of humorless crankiness makes for a very tiresome read.My recommendation is to just listen to the albums and let old Bob keep his personal life to himself."
2,Cold and condescending. What about the music?,"I read this biography not just because I'm a big and longstanding fan of Bob Dylan, but also because of the strength of many of the accolades the book has received, both in Amazon and elsewhere. I couldn't have been more disappointed. The biography is clearly well-researched, despite Heylin's proud but unconvincing defence of the fact that he has never met Dylan. However, the biography lacks any warmth or feel for Dylan and the huge and deep contribution his music has made to modern culture. The book comes down with detail, but much of it is incidental and irrelevant. While there is plenty of gossip around Dylan's fondness for women, drugs and drink, few original insights are offered about his music. Indeed, Dylan's music is hardly assessed at all, apart from occasional references to the views of other critics. Dylan's life and music deserve a lot more."
3,The girls all say 'you're a worn out star',"The first 3/4 of this book is engaging and well thought out. But I think the ""revisited"" portion of the book demonstrates a loss of critical abilities on Heylin's part. Dylan has recently sung, ""The girls all say 'you're a worn out star'"" and unfortunately Heylin is one of those girls. I think it comes down to this. Heylin, in his original ""Behind the Shades"" wrote that Dylan's career looked bleak. The notion of the poet who has lost his muse, itself a cliche, runs throughout the final chapters of the book. Rather than providing true insight into the last decade of Dylan's career Heylin merely returns to this cliche time and again. The truth is more complicated and its quite clear that Dylan's creative powers, far from evaporating are on the upswing with both TOOM and Love and Theft."
2,OK but...,I bought this book for a friend but had to go thru most of her workMcGraw-Hill's Tabe Level A: Test of Adult Basic Education: The First Step to Lifelong Success [MCGRAW-HILLS TABE LEVEL A TEST] by hand. The answer key is so fraught with errors as to make use of this book useless unless the user has someone to manually check their answers.I'd have to give this book a vote of little or no confidence until the problem with the answer section can be corrected. After that is done then this will be a useful tool - until then... not so much.
3,better proofreading required by editors,"The adult literacy center where I work administers TABE as a pre-GED assessment tool. I borrowed this book from the library. Obviously, it's a good resource. My only criticism is the number of mistakes I find as I review problems. See p. 115 ex. E & p. 105 #5. (answer in key cannot be correct). Some typos too see p.110 #4. option a. & p. 115. ex. F in the explanation of problemI started working on practice problems before my students arrived. Surprising amount of oversights made by editor & proof reader & two authors. I'm sure there will be more as I continue to use the text."
1,ERRORS !!!!,"TABE Level D has many, many, errors in answer keys. How can you learn from incorrect answers? If this company is aware of the problem, why don't they correct it or put the correct answers online..Listen to the negative reviews as they speak the truth. Don't buy this book, it will only confuse you."
3,The African-American Writer's Guide to Successful Self-Publishing,I found the text to be informative albeit elementary. It serves well as an introduction to self publishing. It has excellant data base and contact source information focused on the African American market. I'm happy with this purchase.
3,Not bad,"As the author of Hidden Credit Repair Secrets, I found this book to be very valuable. It provided great resources on how to promote and market your book. It went into detail on how to submit to magazines and other publications. Great resource."
3,Picture quality could have been better,I was a bit disappointed with the picture quality of this DVD. It could be that I still have the impression from seeing the movie in a real IMAX theatre at the Kennedy Space Center.
2,Not as it appears,"I purchased this book as a gift, as I had just visited the Alhambra and found it fascinating and very beautiful. The book tells a story of the Alhambra, but be aware, there are no sketches. None. It is a poor copy machine copy from the Library of the University of California with markings (underlines, notations, stamps, etc.)and no sketches. You'd do better to purchase a copy of the Washington Irving book online."
5,SO CUTE AND ADORABLE,my mom suprised me and took me to get this one day after school and i love this one i already had jade but her hair frizzes really really bad so i wanted meygan she is so cute and her accesories are great but if your geting this 4 a girl whos parents arnt in to the whole pajamas that look like underwear you might want to take them out or warn them first so theyre wont be no bad suprises but other than that she is 100% perfect in every way her accesories are adorable especialy the monkey i had the same one that my grandma got me at a carnival and her pajamas are adorable with monkeys all over them im a monkey fan anyway so if your looking to get a slumber party bratz.... meygan is the perfect one.

4,Strong and original,"Anyone who reads this book and is serious about academic studies will find it fresh, illuminating, and well-written. Full of insights about the Romantic period, it usefully introduces readers to a variety of approaches to the idea of theatricality during the late eighteenth century. A page-turner!"
5,excellent tool,This is an excellent tool for those who have to deal with cables with different interfaces at work. It is a time saving tool.
2,Zatoichi,"I will write the same comment on each one that I purchased for my parents. Although the video quality was good, through generations of copying the audio was lousy. My parents, who are fluent in Japanese, needed to read the English subtitles to understand what was being said. Check the quality before keeping the item."
1,Worthless redundant dribble,"I began reading this book with high expectations, and was sorely disappointed. The author has a few noble ideas, but the book really isn't about negotiation or conflict resolution at all. If anything, the book's sole purpose is to give its author a venue for complaining about the injustices she suffers because she is a woman and a nurse. The author is extremely verbose and redundant and offers few valid suggestions for real conflict resolution. Save your money. Don't buy this book."
3,It's all about me,"Usually I read a book because I'm interested in the subject matter. Unfortunately the author seems to think that I'm reading the book because I'm interested in HER. Big difference.Everything in this book seems to be about the author: her opinions; her stories; her realizations; her points of view. In some way, all books are a bit like this, but usually authors learn how to put themselves and their egos in the background, and write about the SUBJECT from their personal point of view. This author doesn't do that... it's about HER, and her struggles with the subject materials.It's similar to sitting at the very back of a theatre. The folk up front are watching the show, but you are watching the audience watching the show. The back of the theatre, unfortunately, is where Ms. Kritek places us.I had a strong sense of the author using the book as a venue for complaint, rather than an exploration of the intricate dynamics of negotiation."
4,"Nice look, but...","My wife and I bought this through an electronics retailer a couple of years ago and it really is a nice entertainment center and we love the look of it and it was easy to set up (although very heavy).We had only a small TV at the time with the plan to get a larger one to upgrade to, since this says it holds up to 36"". However, since the new HDTV sets are so large this entertainment center will only hodl tvs of about 27"". The depth is only 19.3"" and most of these new tvs are about 23""+. This says its depth is 24"", which is true but the depth of the spot for the TV is only 19.3"""
1,I can't believe...,"I can't believe the team involved in this lame production was the same involved in the first one. In the first SCARY MOVIE, you had at least the original idea of satiring the string of recent teen-horror movies. The fun was stupid, in the Zucker brothers / Jim Abrahams style, but it worked.But as for part two... The Wayan brothers made an obnoxious movie, bad tasted, disgusting, funnyless, no plot, no screenplay, bad acting. I hated it with all my power. Never again!!!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,Do not waste your time on this movie. The first one was great but this one was terrible. I regret ever buying the movie before seeing it!
3,"Funny, but......","I have to admit, I laughed my head off during this movie. It has some hilarious sequences, but the sad thing is that most of the sequences are crude, EXTREMELY crude, and it kinda takes away from the funny effect of the film. Some of the skits were just pushing the envelope wayyyy too far, but besides all of that, this was an enjoyable spoof for mature audiences. However, it is not one that I will recommend, because it is definitely not for everyone. Watch at your own risk!*Contains strong, crude sexual humor and graphic language, as well as violence and drug content. Not for children."
1,Disgrace to the original.,"I thought that this movie was one of the worst I have ever seen and should not be bought by anyone. While I do like most movies that fall into the category of stupidor gross humor this was just unbareably dumb and I could barley sit through the entire thing. When I watched the first scene for the first time I thought that the movie would be great, but that and the nike commercial parody was the only good part of the movie. Everything else was just [bad]. On the cover to Scary Movie it says ""No mercy. No shame. No sequel."" Well they should have kept it that way."
2,Scary Movie bites the big one,"This movie was so lame. The jokes were the same as the first one. The casting was horrible. They were seven, yes seven writers on this film. I guess they locked themselves in a room on a weekend to write this movie. The first ""Scary Movie"" was very funny. I was so disappointed. I will only rent this on DVD for the extras."
1,Boring and Pointless !!!!!!,"This movie was just plain stupud. There was no tie-in to the original movie. The plot was pointless, the gags were ridiculous, it looked like a 5 year old created them.The beginning was completley and gross, it didn't even belong with the movie. The characters were not developed and it seemend as if they rushed just to get it out on time.There was one point where they didn't have enough money to purchase walkie talkies... So, you guessed it, they used paper cups with strings... It was completley stupid...Sorry I am using the world stupid so much, but it was a complete waste of film. The entire movie was a waste of everyone's time, the actors inclueded."
2,"Sick, Sick, and more Sick","The sequel to the hit ""Scary Movie,"" is so grotesque and raunchy, that it is hard to find humor in it. Though there are some laugh out loud scenes, the rest of the movie is just in one word...""disgusting!"" These kind of movies make you think what kind of sick people think these ideas up? and it also makes you wonder how mentally healthy our society today is...this certainly isnt making it any better! Anyways, it rates a 2 out of 5 for its effort, but the would have been funnier with less of the sex and crude humor jokes."
5,dope film,this film was abosutley funny. it is one of the most grossest films i have seen in a while. if you like funny films that are gross then this is your film
3,Not [bad] like the first,"Well, we know sequels usually are [bad], and this one kind of is, but it's not really as bad as it could have been. I like the parodies of The Excorcist and the *real* stuff on this one. It's still a little gross, but not annoying like the first one. It's very different, but it's much more funny, although it is still stupid."
3,"Well, what do ya know?","The first SCARY MOVIE was about as funny as a cardboard box (""I wanna see your insides"" ""Then turn to page 54"" eh, heh, heh,....heh?) but this one was actually pretty damn good. This time around, this Wayans brothers steer clear of the SCREAM films, I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and the others from the first film, and stick to haunted house films, and managed to pull off a generally hilarious flick (""There's a poltergiest imn our house!"" ""What's a Poltergiest?) HA, HA, HA, HA, HA."
3,not up to the standards of the 1st,i loved the first movie. this was funny but not as funny as the first. chris elliot as mr. handy puts in all the best parts. overall watchable but not as great and hilarious as the first.
1,I didn't like the first...,"...but this one is much worse. The jokes are tooooo stupid. The title the third Scary Movie is: Scary Movie 3: Episode I: The Lord Of The Brooms. I think the jokes are about Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, The Others and many more. Avoid this movie!"
3,Worth [ticket price],"The good thing about Scary Movie 2 is that I did walk out of the theater feeling I had been entertained. A lot of the jokes were pretty funny, some even bordering on intelligent(such as the Florida recount) and the movie was a lot less raunchy than the first. Now for the bad...this movie seemed more like a work of sketches(a la In Living Color) than a full fledged movie. It makes the first Scary Movie look like a work of art. It seems like the script was written around the gags rather than vice versa. There is no continuity in this film. At the end of the movie, I was like ""hey what happened to so and so's character??"" And what was Tori spelling in this movie? Her part was pointless. Also some of the movie's parodied are kind of dated such as The Amittyville Horror(they should've done The Shining) All in all, I can recommend seeing this movie."
2,"Can't even be qualified in the same class as ""SCARY MOVIE""","This was a pretty dull movie. The best part would be the opening(much like in the original), with James Woods. Other than that, it was pretty crappy, and I don't really recommend it. If your gonna go to a movie, I suggest ""The Fast and The Furious"", or maybe ""A.I."" The sequel was the exact opposite of the first; the first one was hilarious, to the point of tears, and this was unfunny to the point of tears. As far as sequels goes, I suggest waiting for ""American Pie 2"", or ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"". Those two look like they have more to offer. But I thought this had a lot to offer, so I guess looks really can be deceiving. I gave this two stars because that's about how many time I really laughed. [...]"
1,TERRIBLE MOVIE,"I loved the first ones stupid humor...it was so stupid it was funny. This one is so stupid its emberrasing...I mean come on a toilett joke in the first 5 minutes? I thought it might be good though even then cuss that sequence was very funny, but the rest of the movie went to the pot...the jokes and the spoofs were just bland...I hated it...a waste of time and money."
3,I want to retract my last review....,"I went on about James Woods... Anyway, This movie was almost as good as the first one..which I did like."
2,A Sad Disappointment,"I liked the raunchy humor of the first Scary Movie. As they say, leave the best alone and break the mold. I really couldn't get into Scary Movie 2, however, one scene I thought was the funniest was the Excorcist scene and that pretty much is it. I was hoping to see bigger and better things from the brothers that created the first one. I must say I'm glad I rented this before I bought it."
4,Laughter against Creativity.....,"I'm shocked. Know why? It's because of how poorly done Scary Movie 2 was. The original Scary Movie was da bomb, no doubt about that. It was new, the thing that teens wanted to see. The 2nd was not. Ok, so it was hilarous. I'll admit that. But, what exactly were the Wayan bros thinking? Were they trying to add more flave to Scary Movie? Cause it didnt exactly work.They could have done without the Charlies Angel [spoof], but The beginning was good, the whole Exercist thing. And it was easy to spot which movies it all came from. I'm not gonna go off saying this was a bad movie, cause it really wasnt. Not at all. But im not gonna say it deserves 5 stars. Cause it doesnt.However, If your kinda of movie is a hilarous movie that makes no sense, but its still funny, this movie is for you. But if you enjoyed the first, but care that the movie should have a point, i would suggest not getting it.Overall, if you want to laugh, and laugh hard, get it."
1,"Take SCARY MOVIE #1, toss in blender, and pour out mess",Boring. Gross-out gags in volume do not make a comedy movie. The number of spoken gags fall below 40. The sight gags are timed wrong and far too annoying to be funny. If you subtract the stupid things in this movie you have about 6 minutes left to view. Far too much money for so very little.
1,Pure Garbage,"I am so mad at myself for taking my friends to see this movie. It was my treat and I ended up wasting $... on this piece of ....I am a big fan of the first Scary Movie, which was really good. The only thing that saved this movie was some of the jokes but that's all you'll get out of this.Wait until it is at a dollar movie theater or on video. You do not want to waste six bucks on this insult to movies"
1,Horrible,"Scary Movie 2 (I'm sure 3's on the way, sigh) is just a gross, offensive movie about sex, body-parts and profanity. They make fun of The Exorcist. Why? The Exorcist is a very serious, religious, spiritual film, and I find it quite offensive that they'd make fun of it. Making fun of The Exorcist is like making fun of Schindler's List, in my opinion. The other parodies are of countless other movies, none of them being funny in any way. Skip Scary Movie and this one and the one that will more than likely come out next summer."
4,Even Funnier Than the first!,"Ok This movie is halarious. If you liked the first scary movie or Even if you didn't I still recommend going to see this. Once again the Wayans brothers are back putting a lot of scary movies into their place. They cut on pretty much everything they left off of the first. Just a few of these movies are : The Exercist, Hannibal, Hollow Man. Another extremely aspect to this movie is that all other genres of movies thought they were safe, and that Scary movie cannot make fun of us. Well think again film directors because several other movies were cut on.Go See this movie It is well worth it in laughs."
2,Nice try.....,"Scary Movie 2 started out very strong,spoofing the Exorcist. Then it starts to go downhill.Like a few times in the original the humor is often stupid,but not really funny.All I can say is watch it before you buy it."
1,Stay Away,"I wish if I could give this movie no star.The Wayans Brothers need to come to their senses and understand that they got lucky with the first one.The first Scary Movie was real good.Then like everybody else they had to go and make a boring sequel.The first 10 mins of the movie was ok,the rest is a headache.Save your time and money and stay away from this disaster."
5,"""But wait theres more"" ScaryMovie2 (it's freakin hilarious)","Ok if you liked the first one you'll love this one,now making fun of such films as ""The Poltergist"",""The Exorsist ""The Haunting"" and ""Charlies Angels"" but still makes fun of the teen horor flicks, and also makes fun of some comercials like Nike.It's rated R for language,drugs and nudity it is still a grate movie but don't take my word for it go out an see it,but don't blame me if you piss yor pants laughing!Staring Anna Faris and Shawn and Marlon Wayans"
3,"It's Not Okay To Insult God, Tori Spelling","I love the relationship between the caucasian guy who's called Buddy (if I remember correctly) and the caucasian girl with 'black' hair who supposedly has split ends. I also love that they make references to other films. I love the butler's small hand (not literally). I also love that it's a comedy because I think laughter is the best medicince...well, one of the best medicines, but I returned this film because Tori Spelling insulted God in the special features. As a christian, I take God seriously even though I don't go to church every Sunday. It wasn't okay that she insulted God, so I took it back. Why would Tori do something like this?! I am giving this film 3 stars not because it's okay to insult God, but because of the other stars who were great as well as the story line and the fact that it's a funny film."
5,better than 1,why dopeople barge on this this is so frigin hilarious i mean the gags and every thing else shorty is like one of the funniest characters inmovie history ow yeah son anna faris does her funny zany performance tori spelling does a fun job as thpopular girl and the other blkack girl i forget her name but shes a hoot to very funny and orignal
3,We need a stupid movie every once in awhile,"yeah it's really stupid but that's good cause it's meant to be stupid and make you laugh. every scene is pretty much funny. they make fun of excorcist, what lies beneath, the amytiville horror, titanic, saved by the last dance and i dunno i forget. lotsa movies even though some aren't even horror movies. its a fun movie to watch with a buncha friends. first one is better though."
5,the caretaker,funny a must see funny characters the caretakers one of the funniest characters.the toilet humer and the other jokes are to funny to bare
2,Ridiculous,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I rented Scary Movie 2, on the basis that Scary Movie was decently amusing. But this one just had increased toilet humor and violence that were supposed to be humorous but just became gross, predictable and pointless. The only plus side for me, was that I rented the Rocky Horror 25th Anniversary along with this movie, not knowing that Dr. Frank N Furter, Tim Curry, was in the movie. But even Curry couldn't save this diabolical sham of a movie. My rating, 1 low star and another for Curry participating."
3,Not as good as the first,"Well, as you can tell from my title this one is not as good as Part 1. It starts out hilarious but after a while it gets just plain stupid. It has tons of deleted scenes, they arent that funny though. Its very hard to notice all of them, i didnt realize them until i read someone elses review. Thank you! If youve never seen any of the scary movies go for Part 1, its much funnier."
1,Dear Hollywood: Enough of This Inane Garbage,"""Scary Movie 2"" satirizes ""The Exorcist,"" ""Unbreakable,"" ""In Living Color,"" ""What Lies Beneath"" and at least 20 other movies. Nonetheless, it's a lifeless piece of Hollywood drivel that left moviegoers running for the exit doors when it landed with a THUMP in theaters during the July 4th holidays. Most videophiles will probably ask for a refund and rightly so.WHAT WENT WRONG?The first film was fun. Its gross expulsion of movie spoofs kept people howling from start to finish. Part ""2"" does nothing except make you think ""God, did someone actually get paid to write this crap.?"" Or ""My God, what was going through the actor's minds while the cameras rolled?""If you're looking for gross humor, rent ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" ""Road Trip,"" ""Freddy Got Fingered"" or catch ""Not Just Another Teen Movie"" in theaters."
3,what do you expect,"well the first one was bad and the second one was not much better. seeing it in the theater does help the movie though, with the atmosphere of the crowd and everything. wrong on so many levels but you'll find yourself laughing trust me. the overall story is based on the haunting and that movie wasnt great either. so what do you get when you cross a bad movie with an even worst one, funny things. go see it but you'll be more stupid afterwards."
5,Scary Movie with no Sequel.... Nah!,"When in 2000 dimension films release SCARY MOVIE and in the poster read no sequel, I can't imagined. One year later, the second installment of this possible saga, a parody of Scream and other films come back in theaters. More suspense, more laughs, new characters and actors, but repeat the characters of Anna Faris, Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, and the director is Keenan Ivory Wayans. There are parodies of ""The exorcist"", ""Castaway"", and others. Hurry, come to see the sequel of the best horror-laughter movie of 2000, SCARY MOVIE 2."
1,Can you spell BAD?,"The first Scary Movie was hilarious, smart, and self-aware: It knew all the horror genre rules as well as those of a spoof. It found all the right notes. This movie missed them all: it's just plain gross to watch. Endless bowel movements, bodily secretions, excretions, sexual connotations, the list goes on and on. I felt like I was watching a biology experiment go desperately mad. It has the same wise cracking characters as the first film and a few funny moments, emphasis on the word FEW. It felt as if the filmmakers pulled the script together in one day. See the first one, skip the second. They're making a ""Scary Movie 3 Episode 1: Lord of the Brooms"" and I hope it's better than this."
5,Better than first...,"Scary Movie 2 is a lot more hilarious than the first one! I don't really know why, probably because the plot and gags are funnier. Unlike the first, Scary Movie 2 has many more memorable, stand out gags. I can't really pick out a part in this movie that isn't funny! Don't watch this movie expecting to see something less crude then the first because if anything...it's more crude."
1,What was that suppose to be?,"Before keeping up with my comments,I must say that I loved Scary Movie-wassuuuuuuup?""-and the Wayans brothers.But how could they possibly let themselves go into this?I mean,I was just excited about seeing this movie,it took a long time for it to come to Brazil and five minutes after it started I was already willing to leave and get my money back.This film is a compilation of lame,acting,it seems to me that all they wanted was to take some advantage from the first movie.Well,if you really like some comedy,don't watch it.And if you don't like comedy.Don't watch it either.This is the worst movie i've seen this year."
1,Scary Movie 2,"This movie was so lame. The jokes were the same as the first one. The casting was horrible. They were seven, yes seven writters on this film. I guess they locked themselves in a room on a weekend to write this movie. The first Scary Movie was very funny but Scary Movie 2...forget it."
1,"very bad sequel to a very good, funny original","I think the only thing that saved this movie from getting no stars at all was Marlon Wayans coming back as Shorty and the cameo from Howard Stern guest Beetlejuice. The jokes in this movie were almost the same as the original. Cindy being blasted with sperm, Ray with his hand up a guy's...etc. And Marlon Wayans said they were gonna avoid the same jokes twice? Yeah.. Ok.."
1,Scary Movie 2 is a very bad sequel,"The first part of the movie wasn't bad... then they did any thing for a cheep laugh, and they didn't even get any. The Plot if there was one was nothing but throwing things in and making fun of them. The first one was original and funny, but how many times do you really wanna see a guy smoke...or watch a million jokes about guy's... I want my money back!"
3,The Weakest in the Series!!!,"To me, this one isn't as good as the rest, but it's still pretty funny. This spoofs The Haunting, The Exorcist, Poltergeist, What Lies Beneath, Hollow Man and much more. One year after the events of the first film, Cindy, Brenda, Shorty, and Ray are all in college together and are selected by Professor Oldman to participate in his experiment at Hell House. When they all realize the house is haunted, they try to defeat the ghost of Hugh Kane in order to make it out alive. I'd probably recommend SCARY MOVIE 2!!!"
3,Scenes cut out in Scary Movie 2,"There are a Total of 22 Deleted Scenes and Outtakes in Scary Movie 2. I hope someday they will put in all of the Deleted Scenes in the movie, so the movie will be uncut. and I hope The outtakes will be in the movie to someday. they could have a uncut version of scary movie 2. and at least three more versions of scary movie 2."
5,i love this movie.,i really like this movie. scary movie 1 and 2 are my favorites. its so hilarious.
2,More lame than funny,Scary Movie 2 is weak sequel that only has about 3 or 4 scenes that are actually funny. Meanwhile when I saw the first one in the movies I laughed out loud about 30 times. This one is more like a bad Scooby Doo imitation. Plus towards the end it actually takes itself seriously when they're trying to catch the ghost. However Anna Farris is very lively once again as Cindy and has a funny scene where she trys to act as hip as Marlon Waynes. She can probably have a future as long as she stays away from doing a Scary Movie 3.
2,2 stars for the 2nd movie...only 3 for the first Scary Movie,"I thought the first Scary Movie was entertaining...I mean it's not as funny the 2nd, 3rd or 4th time seeing it. But it was worth buying and laughing at.Scary Movie 2, however, I'm not even sure if I'll buy it. The first 20 minutes were funny (and that is pretty much what you see in the trailers) but after that, it did nothing for me at all. I didn't find it funny. Perhaps I was expecting more because of the first Scary Movie and therefore I got my gears going to expect something. That something just wasn't there. I recommend to pass it up."
3,The first one's a lot better,"I have to admit that I'm giving this movie a very weak 3 stars and am even leaning towards towards 2 stars. I guess that it does have a fair share of laughs but it mainly is pretty bad and really idiotic. The first one was idiotic but its jokes were great. But a lot of the jokes here were unpleasentful and disgusting. This one like the others is a spoof off horror movies such as the exorcist and hannibal. It even mocks Charlie's Angels. I found a lot of the jokes distasteful but recommend it for a rent ONLY if you like the first one. Believe me, this one's really stupid and a lot worse than the first. The opening exorcist scene is hilarious as are a good deal more of them but I was expecting something more tasteful and a lot funnier. A dissapointment compared to the hilarious original but it still packs in some memorable jokes."
1,OH MY GOD - - - - - - - -,"I know it was done in less than a year, but it seems at though it was written in about 20 minutes. Soon the Wayans' will realize that sometimes you just have to take your time... Total disappointed, with so much potential. Too bad."
2,If You Enjoy being Appalled . . .,"I saw the first Scary Movie and I found only some of the jokes to be halfway funny. I'm 20 years old, so these movies are aimed at my age range. But, for God's sake, these jokes are really nasty to the most extreme extent. I can think of about two funny parts in the entire movie - one involved splitting a pole for bad luck and another involved ladies and gentlemen with good manners doing a piano medley of Mystikal's ""Shake Ya Ass."" But, on the bright side, the movie did at least have a plot, sort of: college students had to spend time in a haunted house for credits. Keenan Ivory Wayans directed this, which isn't bad for the movie. But, still, it's really something that crosses a line when it comes to what is funny and what is a little too obscene."
2,Running out of ideas?,"I will first off say that the first one is definately better...though both of these movies are cheesy...there are more funny parts in the first one definately. The second..well, I thought the excorcist one was alright..and a couple other scenes in the movie. However, I find most of the movie was cheesy, that they were trying too hard to be funny, but at the same time, its not. Maybe it was fun and funny while they were filming it, but on screen, it looks rather dumb. It looked as if they ran out of ideas of being funny... I wonder if they're making a 3rd one..."
3,A VERY STRONG THREE STARS.,"SM2 IN NOT AS FUNNY AS THE ORIGINAL BUT IT'S PRETTY CLOSE. WORTH WATCHING JUST FOR THE PLEASURE OF SEEING A BUNCH OF WHITE PEOPLE AND A PRIEST SING... AROUND A PIANO. ALSO, MANY OF THE OUTAKES AND DELETED SCENES ON THE DVD ARE HILARIOUS."
3,Good at the beginning,Rent it dont buy it.They best scene is the Exorcist/Amityville scenes.The bird and cat are also funny.Other than that we have scene this before.It gets pretty old fast.zzzzz
1,Scary alright,"The most scary part of this movie is the seemingly lack of self-criticism. Maybe director Wayans should have asked himself the question: ""Do the world really need another, ""comic"" movie to lower standards everywhere?"". But alas he did not.The only remotely funny part of the movie is the introduction, where a parody on the famous ""Exorcist"" scene is made. From that it is all down hill. The jokes and humor all seem to revolve around sex or breasts, and they all fall flat.The plot is something about the lead character being invited to some spooky old house, where some other people have been invited too, and from there the fun picks up. Oh joy! I had hoped that the original movie had kept it promise when it said: No Sequel! But alas. Let us all pray we wont see a Scary Movie 3"
3,"A let down, funny but not as funny as the O.G.","Scary Movie is one of the best comedies ever. No one expected it to make as much money as it did especially with the bad reviews it got but it did. So the Wayans were quick to come up with a sequel and that's the feeling you get when you watch this film, that it was quickly put together without much thought or effort. Don't get me wrong if you loved the first one you will like this one but you will notice something missing. Some of the jokes are recycled, some are very predictable there is nothing really original or new that we haven't seen before. The opening scene is wonderfull very, very funny it gives hope for the rest of the movie but it's a let down after that. This sounds like a bad review but I did give it 3/5 stars and I will definetaly own the DVD when it comes out but compared to the first one it's a complete disapointment..."
1,WHAT WAS JAMES WOODS THINKING????,"I have been a longtime fan of James Woods. Before viewing the first fifteen minutes of this trash, I used to respect him as an actor. After seeing him (...) grunting and groaning, I could never look at him the same way again.I am so sick of all the toilet humor in movies. It's getting really old and stupid. It isn't funny, and has never been.I am just very upset that he did this awful movie.I had to shut it off after that scene, I was just too weirded out that an Oscar caliber actor would resort to such drivel and disgust.If he is trying to show his sense of humor, this was the wrong forte. His acting is usually high caliber, and I hope he realizes it was a grave mistake to his career.Skip this if you are serious Woods' fan or you will be a non fan.I am really tired of movies with so much disgusting antics, it is childish and getting to be really old."
1,Pure crap compared to the original,"I think there was a reason it said on the cover of Scary Movie 1: ""No mercy. No shame. NO SEQUEL."" This horrible sequel should not have been made. I hope Scary Movie 3 makes up for this ridiculous mess."
1,absolutly horrible!!!,"THE PLOT: Actually I turned it off really quickly, so, I dunno the WHOLE thing.MY OPIOIN: awful, blasphemous, sacreligious, and there was only 1 single funny joke in the whole movie.SPECIAL FEATURES: I didn't watch them after the disappointment of the movie......OVERALL: F."
3,Crowd-pleasing and outrageous! A box-office smash!,"This spoof on horror classics and TV shows will be a success as the original! Still no plot, but in this case, who cares when you can laugh like hell! Newcomers join the screen like Tori Spelling(TV's 90210), Tim Curry (Charlie's Angels), Chris Elliot (Snow Day), and James Woods (John Carpenter's Vampires) who makes an appearance as a priest! Of course Marlon & Shawn Wayans, Regina Hall, and Anna Faris from the original appear! The plot varies from classic horror films such as ""The Exorcist"", ""Carrie"", and ""What Lies Beneath"" and the comedy action film, ""Charlie's Angels""! The motion picture takes place in a haunted mansion where the ghouls trip down stairs, ghosts whispering, clowns under beds, cat fights, exorcisms and of course the body count piles up in a funny way! The previews give you a big hint on what the plot is and what some of the parodies happen to be! It'll be a huge hit! Opens JULY 4th nationwide in theaters!"
2,Scary movie 2...or is it stupid movie 2?,"I've seen all four Scary Movie and I have to tell that the second one is the funniest. Yes, they are all stupid, but funny stupid. It's only funny because they are making fun of other pretty good movies. There is some offensive language and content, some might get a little offended."
3,Why not,"I guess this is one of those movies that either gets a very high or low rating. For this one, I'm splitting it down the middle.I think SM2 was about equal to the 1st Scary Movie. The movie actually showed depth this time around with the script (compared to Scary Movie 1). In SM1, I found myself listening to identical lines from Scream movies far too much.The heart of this movie relied on 3 things in my mind: An outstanding intro (which, unfortunately, got you hyped up for little reason), Chris Elliot (who was the hilarious caretaker) and the Nike Basketball spoof. I think for those reasons alone, this movie was worth the viewing. However, despite a nice ""Titanic"" spoof and a few other minor laughs, this movie fell short. About 80% of the movie consisted of blatantly stupid jokes that nobody laughed at.But all and all, this movie was worth my hour and a half. It successfully dissed far more movies than it's prequel, and you didn't have to see the movies they made fun of to laugh (like, SM1)."
5,Better then the first,This movie is very funny I saw it on the 4th the first day it came out. The one guy said the people shouldn't compare it to the first one and give it 5 stars but then he gives it one star because of how he thought the first one was. If you like scary movie you will like this one.
3,"""Fair, But a little to slow.""","Scary Movie 2 wasn't a bad movie, but it had some sexual situations and language issues. Rated R: For Sexual Situations, Suggested Sex, Graphic Language, and brief Violence. Scary Movie 2 is not sutiable, though my dad and I learned the hard way. Anna Farris (Scary Movie 1&3) is a hilarious chracter as the reporter ""Cindy Cambell."" But their also are alot of funny parts too!"
2,Scary Movie 2,"This movie is pretty funny and slap-stick silly, but it isn't as good as the first or the third (and the third wasn't incredibly good either, but it was funny, though). The constipated priest was funny and so was the sick little girl. Excluding certain scenes, this movie is basically a showcase of disgusting, raunchy teenagers caught in disgusting, ruanchy situations that end up poking fun at horror movies in a disgusting, raunchy way. The crude humor is as bawdy as it gets, pushing the envelope for an R-rated movie. The only part that truly satisfied my craving for comedy was the part where they parody that part in ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" where the two guys have tatoos on their backs that say ""Dude"" and ""Sweet."" Otherwise, this F-word-every-five-minutes movie is excessively adult content that destroy the whole idea of a spoof."
3,Scary Movie 2,I thought some of it was really funny and then some of it was lame. So I give it three stars.
2,Not Worth the Money,"as a followup for 2000's funny Scary Movie and a movie with two of my favorite actors of all time (Tim Curry and James Woods), this should have been a hoot for me. but it wasn't. the gags in this installment try far too hard and miss the mark most of the time. every time it builds up with a little steam with one or two funny lines/gags, then comes another barrage of tired being-gross-for-the-sake-of-being-gross gags and lame one-liners to set it back in its place. what's more, where the first movie knew stuck to (mostly) just parodying Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer, along with tired horror cliches, Scary Movie 2 awkwardly goes through new and old horror films with no rhyme or reason. I can't understand why they couldn't have put up a better effort with this considering the many great actors in the cast. a disappointment"
2,Nice...but not as good as the first,Some scenes are repeated from the first. It is not that bad thats all I can say.I think I over rated it with 2 stars too many.
3,"I am a huge fan of spoof humor, and this movie was funny","I still havent seen scary movie 1 or 3. I have heard they are much funnier. Still, i thought that this was pretty funny. IT could have been funnier, but i liked it a lot."
1,OHHHH WHHHHHHYYYY?????????????,"Every spoof in this movie was already used in the first. Let's hope that Dimension Films will realize that the Wayans brothers have pumped their wells dry and have no more funny things to say. Let's put the money into more creative movies like Joy Ride, The Fast And The Furious or Moulin Rouge."
1,"bad, worse, Scary Movie2","The problem with Scary Movie 2, aside from the fact that it skimps on the promise of te first film ('no shame, no mercy, no sequel'), is that the targets for parody are movies like Hollow Man and The Haunting, which are pretty lame themselves. Much of the humor is forced, let's-do-something-stupid-for-the-sake-of-doing-something-stupid...and a lot of it's feels stale. Here's hoping Scary Movie 3 will never surface."
1,The title says it all !!!!,"The plot, such as it is, has the same cast from ""Scary Movie"" staying at a haunted house over a weekend. This is all set up by Tim Curry, playing an evil college professor whose motives are not really explained. Suffice it to say that some spooky things happen and there are parodies of The Exorcist, Poltergeist, Hannibal, The Haunting, Charlies Angels, MI:2, Hollow Man and What Lies Beaneath. The plot is so much more disjointed than Scary Movie, which is, in and of itself, kind of scary."
3,This movie was funny!!!,"Whenever I watch this movie, I skip to the second chapter. I dont like the exorcist scene even though James Woods is a great actor. but the movie over all was hilarious. My favorite scene was when the characters was playing basketball. my second favorite was when Dwight was trying to climb up the steps only to fall back down. I dont like some of the grossest part of the movie, but I dont understand how people can bash this movie saying Scary movie three was funnier than this when they done EVEN have a sense of humor (its obvious that they dont) its their personal opinion and I dont have to respect that. Scary movie two is funnier than the third and I recommend this movie to anybody that has a sense of humor."
2,Other than the,"part with James Woods, which is truly ill but hilarious, the rest of this movie falls flat compared to #1. Everything is just too forced and stretched. Rent it, or catch the first 10 minutes on Cable."
5,wow,one of the funniest films ive seen in a while very funny but of course stupid funny and gross funny
1,rent it,"this is a lousy sequel to the funny scary movie. it is painfully boring during the first half of the movie. till the end of the show, the jokes began to come. i advice u to rent it and only watch it if u got nothing much to do."
1,Garbage,"The first part of the movie was great....then they did any thing for a cheep laugh,and they didnt even get any. The Plot if there was one was notthing but throwing things in and makeing fun of them. The first one was original and funny,but how many times do you really wanna see a guy smoke ... or watch a million jokes about guy's ... I want my money back!"
3,Weakest entry so far,"Scary Movie 2 is funny, when it isn't shockingly gross, and constantly swearing. This movie has so many sex gags, there are almost as many as the times this movie says the f word, being every other sentence. However, the funny parts include Cindy running in slow motion to stop a ghost, the ghost falling down the stairs, (...) But, the sick parts include a scene with a black light, and the part with Cindy and Bobby in a room together. If it sounds like you just couldn't stomach all the sick things in this movie, then don't see it, but if you think you can, well then enjoy."
3,Somewhat funny,"Not all of the jokes are funny (some are just plain disgusting) If you are easily offended, Dont watch this. If you don't mindscat humor you'll find it funny. It's entertaining."
4,one of the best,I enjoyed this movie alot . I dont know why nobody likes it it is very funny and creative. people just dont have a sense of humor anymore. This about a bunch of colage students who are tricked into going to a haunted house and must battle there way out and destroy a polterguist tobefore time runs out and they are all captured by the ghost . I recomend this to people who like Comedys and the dvd has some pretty cool special features buy this you wont be disapointed
2,"no shame, no mercy, NO SEQUEL","The film opens with a spoof on THE EXORCIST. Which sort of gets your hopes up for the rest of the movie. After the spoof on the DUDE WHERES MY CAR? tatoo scene, the movie goes wayyyyy downhill. With so many gross out scenes (which are never a bad thing for a spoof), it looks like the writers focused more on out-grossing the first Scary Movie instead of trying to be funnier.Remember the slogan for Scary Movie I ""No Shame, No Mercy, No Sequel""? I wish they would have stuck to their promise."
5,Good sequal,"They said ""no mercy no shame no sequal"" in the first installment of Scary Movie. It's a good thing they didnt keep their word. Scary Movie 2 stars Marlon & Shawn Wayons, Anna Faris, Regina Hall, Christopher Kennedy Masterson, Tori Spelling, Tim Curry, Chris Elliot, James Woods, and Kathleen Robertson. The cast does a good job of acting. The jokes/spoofs are more funny than in the first. I need to say that the characters that made this movie wildly hilarious were Dwight, Hanson, and Brenda. The highlight of the film is definately the Charlies Angel's spoof. They also do a good job of poking fun at some of today's popular culture. I highly recommend this must-see comedy."
4,I agree good sequal,Scary movie 2 was very funny and at times I think even better then the first movie because the opening scene still has me laughing everytime I watch the movie scary movie 2. I also think the crude humor went further in the second which made it more enjoyable and more laughs for the fans of the scary movie set. But if you don't get gross out by crude sexual humor and sugesstive wording then pick this second movie up in the set and enjoy laugh after laugh all evening long.
2,DVD Skips though it was supposed to be New,"The DVD was supposed to be new. It took quite a few minutes for it to even start playing on my Xbox and then at the end it wouldn't stop skipping and I got the ""trying to read media"" message every couple of seconds. The packaging was horrible when I got it too. I only spent like $5 so I'm not heartbroken but I definitely won't order from them again."
1,How bad can a movie be.,"This film is soooooooooooooo bad it makes Van Damme movies look good.Its worse than the original which was also terrible.I dare the Wayans brothers to make a good movie,cos they are getting alot of praise for doing stuff we have all seen before and which was better,they just take memorable scenes,from good movies put a few 'jokes' about body parts and bodilly functions in and expect it to be funny,where as people like the farrely brothers do this brillantly and if they made this movie it would be great,just avoid this and go watch paint dry."
1,Even worse than the original.,"When I saw them make fun of Hannibal,I got really ticked off.These people need to go get a life and try getting publicity for making a Hallooween sequel instead of trying with this trash.0 out of 10.If this movie flew in my bedroom window,I'd throw it out of the window.Total garbage and a complete waste of time."
3,Not As Good As The First!,"The first was by all means better! While this movie was able to keep the laughs rolling, the storyline was too stupid for my taste. And They didn't have a scene more hilarious than the fat girl trying to escape from the doggy door in the garage. But it did have it's moments. Like when the old people started singing a trashy rap song, and the butler with the deformed hand basting a chicken in spit! Most of the humor is so grose it's funny! Yes, I did like it and will probably own it some day, but I can't rate it as high as the first."
3,"FIRST 20 MINUTES WERE HILARIOUS, DOWNHILL FROM THERE","Two stars alone are for the first 15-20 minutes of the movie, which showcased ""The Exorcist"" spoof and I must say that I haven't laughed so hard in a LONG TIME. I took a sip of my drink and had to spit it out in laughter! I'm not going to give any of the jokes and gags away, but I guarantee that if you don't laugh you are made of STONE. The other star was for the second-half of the movie, which sadly wasn't as funny. Sure, I chuckled a bit at times, but it wasn't laugh-out-loud funny. The only thing that kept my eyes GLUED to the screen was the ""Big-Boobed"" Kathleen Robertson, who doesn't dissatisfy any of her fans. I'd see it again only to catch the first scene. Its worth a viewing."
2,Should Have been Better,Well I Was Very Excited To HEar About Scary Movie 2 After loving The First One but It Fell In comparison The Spoofs Were Not That Funny With A Few Saving Graces Such As David Cross And The Always Loveable Anna Faris.The First 10-15 Min Spoof Of The Excorsist Was funny But It Went DownHill From There Worth A Rent Only if Your Vewing All The Scary Movies.
1,AVOID SCARY MOVIE 2!,".... I know it was done in less than a year, but it seems at though it was written in about 20 minutes. Soon the Wayans' will realize that sometimes you just have to take your time... Total disappointment, with so much potential. Too bad."
1,PIECE OF GARBAGE,"I don't know what went on on the Wayans brothers minds (Money, maybe...) to release such a disgraceful picture, disguised as ""comedy"", but in truth just a mere vehicle for some of the worst dirt jokes ever created for screen. There's no semblance to a plot, no chemistry between actors (due to the lack of plot!!). You gonna tell me this is a movie to forget about plots and just enjoy. But it is impossible to enjoy. I hope this movie flounders in the cash office, so they can never make a third SCARY MOVIE! But, reading to some reviews, I think that willl not be the case: this movie will be successfull and they will make another one.... Where are your brains, people ???!!"
2,Doesn't hold a candle to the Original,"After enjoying the original Scary Movie, I was quite disappointed with this sequel.The majority of the jokes were dopey or stale, and I just didn't find myself laughing that much during the film.Tori Spelling was just *awful* in this picture, and it's no wonder that the majority of her efforts ended up on the cutting room floor (you can view them as deleted scenes on the bonus disc if you feel like punishing yourself).The talented Tim Curry is totally wasted here, as well. Another big name, James Woods, was pretty funny as the priest with bowel problems.I very much like the lead (Anna Faris), but she's not enough to save this poor production. The only thing I find scary now is that they've made part 3 - I'll most likely pass."
1,Scary Movie 2 was a great comedy!,"Scary Movie 2 was a great movie. It had the lamest jokes ever executed in the history of comedy. The Exorcist spoof was stupid and I wasn't laughing at most of the time, but I have to tip my hat off to The Wayans brothers anyway. They proved that they know how to execute a comedy, and because of that I'm going to give Scary Movie 2 a rating of zero stars for an outstanding job. I would've given them an additional star had they included scenes of me and my wife Cerina Vincent from Not Another Teen Movie doing things that Andrew Dice Clay would be turned on by, but the scenes of me and her together would've had Scary Movie 2 banned in about 50 countries.And I'm looking forward to Scary Movie 3 so when I watch it I can throw popcorn and soda at the screen. Once again, Scary Movie 2, superb movie. Rent it tonight and go home angry."
1,Very Bad and disgusting movie,"It is the worst movie ever, I won't give it even one star to rate it. I feel that I waisted 82 minutes of my life by watching this movie. It is disgusting and and has nothing to say about it more than that. Some good actors and actress also waisted their time and reputation in this movie."
4,Ambient music done right,Good collection of ambient tunes that you can enjoying listening to over and over.
5,5 star,This is one of the best and most cost effective meal replacement shakes on the market. one of the best for you as far as nutritional value and also on the cheaper side compared to a lot of other meal replacement shakes. I've also found chocolate met rx to be one of the best tasting of all the other meal replacement shakes on the market that i have tried which has been quite a few.feel free to add in extra protein powder if you like or do as i do sometimes for a little bit better taste and nutrition i add a tiny bit of milk and a banana and blend it up.
1,its just a candy bar,"This baffles me. They call it a ""meal replacement"" bar, but there's enough sugar in these to make a big wedding cake. This isn't a meal replacment bar. It's an appetizer with 50 table spoons of sugar. So you get a little protein and enough sugar to ruin any health benefits."
1,Not as advertised,"Don't get me wrong, I love the stuff, BUT, when the product is advertised or marketed on Amazon as a ""Pack of 42"", I expect to receive a box of 42 packets of powder. That's not what I received - my boxes contained only 40 packets of powder. I think this is deceiving. Since Amazon is only advertising the product for sale, the problem is with the seller, DAB Nutrition."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A shoddy low-budget ""thriller"" that offers some campy fun in its terribleness (the awful accents! the non-existent production values!), Demolition University should be required viewing for those who like its similarly-awful predecessor Demolition High but avoided by everyone else."
5,Good for ALL ages!,"Because of the fact that I'm only 17 years old, I just got around to watching this movie. I'd always heard about it but I never knew what it was about. And, to be quite honest, I didn't even think about watching it because I thought it was in black and white! (Eh, I didn't know when it was made!)My dad made me watch it this past weekend and I fell in love with it! Unlike most romantic comedies made today, both main characters are broke. It doesn't follow the mold of: poor/average girl falls for rich guy blah blah blah or the other way around. It was funny (Mickey Rooney's character was HILARIOUS!) and sad (when Holly finds out about Fred) and sappy (the last 20 minutes) all at the same time.This movie is great for anyone, whether you saw it the first time around or you're a ""late viewer"" like me."
1,"TERRIBLE, THE WORST ONLINE EXPERIENCE","DON'T ORDER ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER! ! ! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND ALL YOUR TIME!I ordered this movie on 5/18 and it was to be delivered no later than 6/8. The seller took my money, but NEVER even attempted to ship the movie or contact me. I waited and contacted the seller when the due date past. No response, ignored, and I had to go through Amazon to get my money back. The seller finally contacted me when he had to return the money, stating that 'he was out of town.' Was he on Mars, where internet doesn't exist to contact me. Don't waste your time or money with this seller."
1,The Moonriver Film,"This film lose its innocence when we can see a tool of torture, -used in the cruel bullfightings- in the hand of Jose Da Silva Pereira, on a scene at the stairs. This fact spoils everything."
4,fast service,I have never watched the video. It was a gift for a friend. The product was shipped to me on time!
4,Hepburn and Peppard's chemistry goes unmatched here!,"Breakfast At Tiffany's (1961) Blake Edwards directs Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard in this romance classic.Patricia Neal, Buddy Ebsen, and an unrecognizable Mickey Rooney also star. Add a beautiful and timeless score ""Moon River"" by longtime Edwards collaborator Henry Mancini and you have a solid winner. One of Peppard's best roles ever, with Hepburn at her very loveliest."
2,Read the book instead,"This is pretty different from Capote's terrific novella. They ""Hollywood-ized"" so much of it, that it could only be described as ""loosely"" based on...... if you have modern movie sensibilities, you may find this way too predictable and sappy, especially the ending. I heard that Capote didn't think much of the movie, and I'm inclined to agree."
3,"Do NOT buy this from ""supermoviedeals.""","Do NOT buy this from ""supermoviedeals."" Defective DVD, worst customer service ever. This piece of garbage still won't play. I want a replacement!!!!!"
4,KES Evenstar,"The playgirl, Holly, lives a fairly wild life. she want to be free and so anything she wants. The man above her apartment, gold digger and writer, becomes fascinated with this lost woman. He's ready to make sacrifices for her, but she wanted money more then love. Throughout the movie he's waiting for her to finally choose. This movie is very funny at some scenes and is fairly sweet and touching."
4,a classical example of yesterday's and today's love story,"'Breakfast at Tiffany's' is a story i will never forget. Not because i liked the book, but because of the reality of a woman's dream. i want to thank whoever wrote this book, and opened my eyes to a world of love, fate, and wistful thinking. END"
4,Audrey Hepburn Shines,"I am a huge Audrey Hepburn fan. This movie was definitely not my favorite of hers, Roman Holiday is. She doesn't seem very suited as Holly Golightly, who is a girl about town and seems so glamorous and carefree, even though she struggles with her life. I think that though she appeared to be carefree, she was actually quite depressed. The only thing that can cheer her up from 'the mean reds' is to go to Tiffany's.Hepburn is just beautiful in this movie and it's a delight to watch her. One thing that really annoyed me was the Asian guy who owns the apartment builing. He was SO annoying and such a bother. Was he meant to be humorous? Because he definitely was not. Anyway, her costumes were just fabulous, since after all they were designed by Givenchy. It's a fun movie, and Audrey Hepburn does shine, even if it is not the most suitable role for her. And obviously there's 'Moon River', one of the most beautiful songs ever."
5,not sure,this movie is great i swa the poster ad i wanted to check the movie out and i really like it
4,High Quality Remake of a Classic,"Saw this movie many years ago. Wanted to see it again and have a copy for my dvd library. Was very pleased with the quality of the picture/sound in this ""mastered in high definition"" centennial collection dvd. Really enjoyed Audrey Hepburn's performance as the quirky, kookey (on the surface) Holly Golightly and the quality of the dvd contributed to the enjoyment."
1,what?,i have wanted to see this movie for years because i had always heard such wonderful things about it. what a bust. holly golightly is just too flakey to be able to follow in this movie. totally unrealistic plot. and really it was going no where. don't bother with this movie. it was a real disappointment.
5,Classic,I bought this for my sister for Christmas - it's a must-have for every family DVD collection. Any Audrey Hepburn movie can be watched again and again and is never tiresome!
3,a sort of good rendition of Truman Capote's book,"This is a sort of good rendition of Truman Capote's book. I was chagrined to see that the ending is not the same as the book. I suppose that it made for better popularity, but I liked the independent, liberated Holly, which this ending takes away. It also does not address the incipient homosexuality of the writer, making him 'safe' for her in the story."
3,"Good, but could be better","The item arrived in good condition, however, the description claimed that it was in brand new packaging, when in fact it was a new cover, with new shrink wrap --which anyone can do, and the art card was so generic! And to top it all off, the DVD was scratched.There is just no way that this was a new DVD.On a good note, it plays well and it arrived in a timely manner and it was inexpensive."
3,Frothy,"Blow away the froth from the top of this movie, and what do you have? Just more froth and more froth. The one saving grace is Audrey Hepburn. She simply looks great.Hepburn's character in the movie is little more than a high class prostitute. She is willing to sell herself to the highest bidder. George Peppard's character is nothing more than a male prostitute who lives comfortably on the donations of a rich woman played by Patricia Neal. Mickey Rooney is embarrassing as a Japanese neighbor, complete with thick glasses and buck teeth.Well, it doesn't take a genius to predict that Hepburn and Peppard will give up their sinful ways, with an ending as sweetly sentimental as the tune that won the Academy Award, ""Moon River.""Realistic, the movie isn't. It's a sort of urban fairy tale, and in that it is somewhat successful--that and Audrey Hepburn's charm."
5,golightly.,"This movie is a true classic. And Audrey Hepburn makes it superb. I came to truly adore Moon River and this movie has instantly become one of my favorites. Whenever I have a case of the ""mean reds"" watching Breakfast at Tiffany's manages to make the day better. So please watch this movie and I swear, it will change your life."
4,Beneath the appearances!,"This smart film behind the seductive music, the rapture scenes along the most visited places of this monumental city, the imminent love affair, and the charismatic presence of the everlasting bride of Hollywood - the unforgettable Audrey Hepburn - is not a simple love story.The story is painful and merciless, he is a pimp and she sells sexual favors, they have to live to keep their right to dream, but the charm and the captivating storytelling makes you at the end of the movie tend to forget the dramatic departure' s point."
3,Bizarre concept,"I love Audrey Hepburn but I just never understood the appeal of this story. The character Audrey portrays is a hooker, yet she acts like a virgin princess, and we are supposed to -- what? -- love her? sympathize with her? Ditto Peppard. In a way it's an earlier version of Pretty Woman -- romanticize a prostitute to the point where she is not remotely a believable prostitute, thus making prostitution kind of sort of OK and not the demeaning thing it is. In both films, the women are seemingly motivated, not by a need to put food on the table, but by a desire for Real Money. How is this charming?"
1,Just plain bad,"This movie was downright crapola. Why the hype, I have no idea. Bad plot, bad acting, over hyped piece of garbage."
1,Racist portrayal ruins the movie,An otherwise excellent film ruined by a very racist portrayal of an Asian American character
3,Narrow appeal,"Breakfast at Tiffany's is a movie that seems untouchable in its high-gloss, 60s stylishness. But apart from the charismatic Audrey Hepburn who is mysterious and elegant as Holly Golightly, and the Henry Mancini soundtrack, facts have to be faced. Breakfast at Tiffany's is not a great film. George Peppard, for all his blue-eyed good looks, has the screen presence of a deep freezer and Mickery Rooney's cameo as the irate Japanese upstairs neighbour is terrible. I would say Breakfast at Tiffany's is a good movie for Audrey Hepburn fans and students of 60s style but unsatisfying for the rest of us."
4,Lovely!,"A sweet movie that never fails to cheer me up. Even the cat's performance is perfect. It would have been about 10 times better without the Mickey Rooney character, however.If you don't feel like crying at the last scene, you'd better make sure you still have a pulse."
5,BRAVO!,"It's really nice to watch this great movie. Audrey is so charming, beautiful and elegence. Moreover, the clothes inside are excellent too."
5,The edition I've been waiting for and didn't even know it!,"""He's all right! Aren't you, cat? Poor cat! Poor slob! Poor slob without a name! The way I see it I haven't got the right to give him one. We don't belong to each other. We just took up one day by the river. I don't want to own anything until I find a place where me and things go together. I'm not sure where that is but I know what it is like. It's like Tiffany's."" --easily my favorite Audrey Hepburn movie and this version only compliments the timeless style and elegance of Audrey!Well, I had intended on logging in and writing this long review about Paramount's latest release of the Audrey Hepburn classic ""Breakfast at Tiffany's""; however, Dennis A. Amith (kndy) has written probably the best review I've read concerning this release, so I'll have to defer.Looks like the best I can do is chime in with yet another 5 star!!"
4,how old is holly?,"Overall, this is a well-done movie, with the exception of Mickey Rooney.My problem is not in the adaptation of the Truman Capote novella--it IS a very different story than what's being told here. Could you film a version that's closer to Capote's story? Of course. But this film works as a stand-alone piece.My problem is: how old exactly is Holly supposed to be? Audrey Hepburn was 31 when she made this movie, and while she's absolutely enchanting in it, SHE LOOKS 31. But when Buddy Ebsen shows up, he tells George Peppard that Holly was just shy of 14 when they married, and that his first wife died on the 4th of July, 1955. Since the movie is set in 1961, that would make Holly (at most) all of 20 years old."
2,Not Worth It,"Purchased Breakfast At Tiffany's - Paramount Centennial Collection (Mastered in High Definition along with Audrey Hepburn Collection (Breakfast at Tiffany's / Roman Holiday / Sabrina). After watching both, there was no discernible difference between them. Save your money and purchase The Collection. You get three movies for the price of one."
2,Highly overrated movie,"I am very much getting into classic movies the last few years and (as stupid as it sounds) hearing moon river on sex and the city and knowing it was connected to this movie made me want to see it. I agree with the observation that audrey hepburn is very classic and elegant but I found the movie to be extremely boring!!!! In fact the only part I did enjoy was the music. Perhaps I went into it with too high of expectations since it is such a revered movie, but good acting or not, it was very slow paced and I fail to see why this was such a hot movie."
2,neurotic,"This movie does not age well so it really isn't a classic that I will be recommending to future generations (unlike My Fair Lady.) It's not the prostitution that bothers me but the main character's not at all charming behavior. She's very tedious and pretentious despite being played by Audrey Hepburn. Audrey Hepburn was wonderful but not all her films were successful. I bet James Dean would have been tiresome too if he hadn't died while he was ahead. Unlike Elizabeth Taylor (and her modern day successor of adiposean beauty Scarlett Johannsen), Audrey Hepburn could not make a bad film watchable. Elizabeth Taylor was in a lot of strange films and very few perfect films but in some of her lesser films, she managed to make a better mini film inside of the bigger movie. She did it with The Last Time I Saw Paris despite having no chemistry with Van Johnson."
5,60s perfect,"Audrey told the director ""if the song goes, I go."" Sure am glad they kept the song. If you haven;t seen this one, well, ""you just haven't lived baby!"""
5,Wonderful Production Values!!,"I just received the new Paramount Centennial Collection ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and I have to say it's wonderful. They did a great job of remastering and Dolby editing. I own all three releases of the DVD and this is by far the best. I ran it on my Sony Blue-Ray, which upscales, into a 42"" Toshiba with a Sony 7.1 receiver (5 Speakers) and the production is almost as good as my Blue-Ray discs. If you're a ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" or Audrey Hepburn fan this is a must have! Great job Paramount!"
4,A classic for its time...,"Although it was made before I was born, I actually enjoyed this film. My only issue was the portrayal of the Japanese apartment manager which spoiled it for me, I agree with the Amazon editorial review on this subject. Rooney is a great actor so its not an issue with him, more of a comment on the times perhaps. I agree with most of the review of the past reviewer who wrote a bit about Japanese people, except to say, ""Ainu-shmamu""!!It's a classic movie for its time, in many ways much more interesting dialog than in movies these days, timeless subject matter. What can you say about Audrey Hepburn... Interesting to see George Peppard in this role since my exposure to him has been limited to the ""A-Team"" and old war movies."
2,"Sorry, but cuteness doesn't count..","Holly Golightly is no doubt adorable. What frustrates me is that the director and producers think that 2 hours of Holly acting cute counts as a movie. The plot is simple and doesn't make much sense: A young gold-digging Holly Golightly is obsessed with the idea of marrying a rich guy. She then takes her equally money-obsessed neighbor shoplifting and true love somehow instantly sprouts from there. This movie is not for me, but you might like it if you believe in ""love at first sight"" and have a thing for Holly's classic charm and silly but cute antics.Another thing, the one and only Asian person in the movie was portrayed as a buck-teethed, rude, socially-retarded, and all-around pathetic loser. I am Asian myself and was deeply offended that Asians are stereotyped in this movie as being the stupid and ugly people of American society. The thought of the general public laughing at an immigrant's accent and lack of English skills is disturbing."
2,I Don't Understand Why This Movie Is Such an Icon,"I've wanted to see this movie for years, but was very disappointed. It was not at all what I had expected, somehow."
5,More Depth than you might expect,"I was surprised at the number of reviews that state that this is a lighthearted, airy, feel-good comedy. I actually found it very dark. Peeling away the layers of the airiness of the feel (remember, this was written by Truman Capote), you actually get a very complex story and commentary on the emptiness of life. This is one of my favorite movies for that very reason."
5,A classic romantic comedy,"I have seen many romantic comedies, but ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is -- by no stretch of doubt -- my all-time favorite. The chemistry between Audrey Hepburn (one of my favorite actresses) and George Peppard is one of the best I have ever seen.Whenever I'm in the mood for a classic, I curl up in bed and watch ""Breakfast at Tiffany's."" It just doesn't get any better than that!"
5,"It has the word ""classic"" written all over it!","I just love 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' and even though I'm 22 years old and most of my peers don't watch old movies, I'm a big fan of them, especially Audrey Hepburn movies. She is her best on this one, her presence, her style, I don't think any other actress would've played this movie better than she did. I'm a sucker for romantic movies, and this one, and when I hear 'Moon River' on the scenes, I cry like an idiot. This movie does have the word 'classic' written all over it and it should be on everyone's movie collection."
5,classic movie,"What's not to love about this movie. It's a true classic and timeless. Loved it. Great for ""date night"" or dressing up with the girls and watching."
3,"Silly Chick-Flick, But Not A Total Waste Of Time","After years of hearing what a classic this film is, I was disappointed after finally watching it. The story is unbelievably absurd at times (If Audrey Hepburn's character really grew up on a farm in the mid-west and came to New York just a few years before, no amount of speech and voice training could make her sound like that!) Also, Holly Golightly seems way too sweet and innocent to be a prostitute.Nevertheless, the film is worth watching to see 1960's New York City looking so clean and inviting, Audrey Hepburn's outfits, and -- above all --- George Peppard falling in love. Plus, after watching the film I couldn't get the song ""Moon River"" out of my head. I found out the lyrics are not so great but the music is very beautiful.I wouldn't call ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" a must-see film, but it wasn't bad."
2,Read the book instead!,I agree with the viewer from Florida. Hepburn just isn't Holly Go Lightly. This film is 60's fluff and does not do Truman Capote's novel justice at all. If you want to read a true masterpiece get the book!
3,I'm going to have to agree with Capote..,"I understand this movie is an iconic film for a lot of women. And you can clearly see that there are a number of fictional characters inspired from this movie-Carrie bradshaw leaps to mind, but honestly I've never found anything cute or charming about ditzy or flighty women. Even Capote (the man wrote the novella this movie is based from) didn't like this movie. Now I don't hate it but it doesn't speak to me or tug my heart strings. Hwever, I do like the symbolism with the cat at the end. Though I agree with 'people don't belong to people' but you can be a part of each other's lives. Over all, it's cute, but not my favorite Audrey Hepburn movie."
5,A pitch perfect romantic comedy,The film that launched Blake Edward's film career and gave us perhaps Audrey Hepburn's most memorable character. A pitch perfect romantic comedy sans the mania that developed in later Blake Edwards and later romantic comedies. The charm and grace that seemed to come so naturally to Ms. Hepburn and dominates so many of her roles can make us forget that she was a fine actress. The moments when the fear slips through the desperate-for-security Holly Golightly's facade of good spirits are all the more powerful because we forget that the actress is capable of such fine craft.The film includes the requisite Blake Edwards extended party scene but this was when he was still fresh with ideas and not desperate for laughs so it fits naturally into the story.
1,Too old,"I purchased this book many years ago, before I really learned Kreyol. This is a very old textbook that teaches an old version of Kreyol - more of a French version. The teaching format is good, but the material is not applicable to current language usage in Haiti."
4,Excellent golf shirt,"I bought one to try and just ordered a couple more. Light weight, very comfortable, moves with my swing and doesn't get soggy when I sweat on the course, like cotton polos do."
2,small,"Disappointing, even though the picture shows them as aprox. an inch long. Only one or two actually were. However, all other sellers seem to be the same, but at least could tell by the picture."
2,Not recommended,"I recently began study with a Shaman who instructed me to purchase 2 Crystal quartz stones and a Chakra set. I asked where to purchase and was told to ""follow my inner self"". My inner self led me to this seller and this purchase. The Chakra set I received was about what I expected from the website listing with a few exceptions: #1) There are 6 Chakras-set includes 8 stones, confusing me. The 6 Chakra colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple and Clear. There was no yellow stone (Citrine), no orange stone in set but there were 2 black stones.? #2) Instruction for stones seemed self explanitory-but as I am not well versed in gemology I wasn't certain which stones were which as color of stones is not listed with the name. I took set to my Shaman & was politely told ""My inner self needs alot of work"". Get the picture?"
1,Horrible,This is the worst tape I have ever seen. It gives about 5 minutes of Venice and the rest with a travel agent about planning your trip.
1,"Italy for beginners, 5 minutes in Venice","We searched on Keyword ""Venice"" to buy a video in preparation for a return to Venice. We were roundly disappointed by this primer on travel in Europe which happened to have several short segments on Florence and venice. Poorly advertised, not poorly done. It is NOT a travelogue as much as a how to plan a trip lesson."
3,Makes a good gift,"With the Prime shipping, this made a great last minute gift. It seems a little pricey for the amount of fish, but the quality was good (according to the person I gave it to). In the end, I think this is better than a fruit basket or something similar."
5,couldn't put it down....,"This book is written for those who have eyes and ears to see and hear beyond which is obvious. It is evidence of the struggles we all face in our lives that manifest in one form or another. Once I began reading, I couldn't put it down for days until I was done. When I closed the book, upon finishing, I was left with a feeling that I can't quite describe, leaving me satisfied, yet wanting more... well done."
5,give it a chance!,"This is one of those books you have to give a chance before writing it off. It has something to say about our world and the role we play in it. It is passionate, thoughtful, adventurous, provactive, and anything but boring. As a debut novel, there are some quirks to be found, but that is part of the charm of this novel. It has a living qualilty, like a conversation shared among thoughtful parties. The poetry that marks each chapter is enough reason to buy this book, for the poetry is profound and prophetic. Give this book a chance and keep your eyes and ears open for what is coming next from this new author."
3,Good not Great,I have had this remote for several years now. It was great until we got a DVD player. This remote does not work with a DVD player. Also the back of it came off and the memory is Horrible memory.
5,Outstanding study of several outstanding Christians,"This book contains a thoughtful account of and reflections on several outstanding Christian leaders who have made exceptional commitments to dedicating their lives to Christ. Many of these leaders were striking for their abilities to examine difficult issues and draw conclusions that were dictated by their consciences, not necessarily in conformity with the majority of the church or with a majority of citizens."
4,Good book for school...,"Im a college student, I had to get this book for a class....I like the way this book can relate to current (of its time) issues and this relates to things I grow up in..however it can be overpriced in book stores and I recommend getting it from Amazon..."
5,What waist sizes will this fit???,"How long is this belt? Being on the chubby size, I want to know if it will fit my waist before I order it!"
4,Works really well with my old technology walkman.,I am happy with my Hands-Free Sport Case. I have a walkman that I do not want to discard because it plays both am and fm radio and I frequently walk and listen to my favorite shows at the same time. I have worn through two holders in the past. This holder is sturdier than the others and it appears it will last a long time; well after they stop making them due to low demand.Satisfied Customer
4,Exacty as Advertised,The Tune Belt was delivered quickly and met all expectations. It was equal to or better than my previous model which was several years old.
1,"""Little Nicky,"" better known as: ""The Worst Movie Ever Made""","Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Adam Sandler movies. I think he is very talented. However, this movie is, without a doubt, the worst movie I've ever seen. For the love of God, stay away from this film."
1,"Wow, I was impressed it made it the theater","Well, aside from the entire row in front of me(12 people) abandoning the movie, there wasn't much else that seemed memorable about this film. It ripped off Waterboy, with bit parts by Henry Winkler, and the 'you can do it' guy and seemed incapable of letting Adam Sandler make a single joke... It's one of those movies I left scratching my head thinking why? If you like bad, overdone, in your face product placement and seeing Adam Sandler generally just walk around and be pathetic, then maybe you'll like this one. It didn't hurt, but it sure didn't seem like a comedy. Story 2 stars, comedy no stars..."
2,Bottom of the Sandler collection,"This one was just badly written. With the doofy speech impediment, Sandler can't really shine. The only thing that saves this movie is the appearances of characters from his previous films. I think I'd rather watch Bulletproof again."
1,The worst movie ever....seriously.,"I was shocked at how totally stupid this movie was. I usually like Adam Sandler, but this movie was a total joke.Save your money."
1,NOT ONE FOR KIDS,ADAM SANDLER IS THE SON OF SATAN IN THIS SUPPOSE TO BE FUNNY MOVIE BUT (IS NOT)!!PATRICIA ARQUETTE IS NOT CUTE IN THIS NOR IS ADAM FUNNY. P.S IF YOU WANT TO SEE A GOOD COMEDY VIEW HAPPY GILMORE WITH ADAM SANDLER.ONE OF HIS BETTER ROLES.
1,Worst movie I've ever seen,"I hate this movie, because it was a waste of my time and money to watch it. I never laughed nor cracked a smile."
3,Say Mr. Beefy!!!,"This is not nearly as good as his other comedies, but still fun to watch if you are a Sandler fan (or SNL). I especially liked all of the esoteric ""Heavy Metal"" references! It was funnier than I thought (I wasn't expecting much from the reviews I read). One irritating problem was ""Nicky's"" voice in the movie, it was hard to hear what he was saying. The movie really deserves 3-1/2 stars, but the system doesn't allow for it. All in all a good silly little flick."
3,"Funny Movie-DVD, Not So Much","I've rented this movie before and it is pretty hilarious. So I decided to purchase it along with a few other Adam Sandler movies to add to my DVD collection. Sad to say, the DVD itself didn't play very well for whatever reason. The first three scenes didn't play at all (the first scene is the arguably the best part of the entire movie). The rest of the movie skipped every once in a while and had a yellow line through the picture most of the time. The parts I did see were entertaining and outrageous and I do recommend this movie if you're an Adam Sandler fan, but just be careful when buying this DVD. It may not be worth it in the end."
5,love it,I love Adam Sandler! He's so funny. This adds to my collection of his movies. I would recommend this product to you.
1,I hope Blockbuster will give me a refund!,I only rented this movie because a friend of mine told me that this was one of Sandler's best movies. I had no intention on seeing it in the theatres when it was out and now I know why. This movie was nowhere near as funny as Sandler's previous movies. He is a very funny man and I have been a fan of his for a long time. This movie however makes me not too excited for his next movie. I hope that he doesn't make anymore movies like this. I just hope that I can get my money back for wasting it on such a horrible attempt at a funny movie. This movie was so un-funny that me and my roommate both decided to stop it before it was even thirty minutes into the movie. I need to laugh at least once during the first part of a comedy to stay interested in seeing it. This movie [stinks]!
1,Little Nicky,"Unfortunately, the dvd I was received will not play in any of my dvd players. I've also tried using portable dvd players and a playstation 3 which reads DVDs. When I try to put the dvd in it says its ""wrong region"" so I think there is a problem with the actual dvd rather than all the systems I've used trying to make the DVD work. I would definitely like to return it for a copy of the DVD that will actually work..."
1,A Total POS,"I wish there was a way to give this toilet bowl of floating fruit a ZERO rating. Hitler in a tutu gets his daily pineapple anal cleansing... yup - that's actually the high point in this complete loser. I watched it with a bunch of friends and after most of them began carrying on their own conversations 20 minutes into it out of complete boredom, I pulled it and tossed it in the trash. Glad I only paid $1.99 for a used copy, and even that was too much."
5,Devilishly Good! and Sinfully Funny!,"Oh my this is Hilarious! the Devil has been betrayed by 2 of his 3 sons whom plan to take satans throne for the next 10,000 years well, little nicky (adam sandler) is Lucifers last Hope! can he get his brothers locked into his fathers flask? will they destroy the world? will satan fall apart before nicky can save him? will they shove the big pineapple into hitler? or the small one? find out the hilarious answers in this great comedy! If you have not seen this (due to modern cave dwelling?)Then I strongly recommend watching this asap!loads of extrasOzzydog with demon whizzOh my lord this is funny.rodney dangerfield getting ""no respect"" in hell!5 stars all the way!Buy it Here!Little Nicky (New Line Platinum Series)"
3,Not Adam Sandler's Best,"Adam Sandler has made some great movies. Although ""Little Nicky"" was not terrible, it was a little disappointing compared to some of his other hits. First of all, the whole plot and setting were a little far-fetched. It was completely unrealistic. We all know that hell is not a fun place and the devil is not a nice guy. The movie has its funny lines, just like all of Adam Sandler's, but it was not nearly as quotable as ""Billy Madison"" or ""The Water Boy."" It's not a waste of an hour and a half; however, the time would be better spent watching his newer film, ""Mr. Deeds."""
2,sandler's first failure,"well he had it comming. he had a string of unbelivable hits and here we are. good plot, good acting, bad script and not funny too bad it did have potential"
2,It's a waste of time,"I also listened to a friend and went out to rent it. I found this movie so cheap and dumb. After awhile, I started to get irrirated at Sandler's character and the way he talks. This is the kind of low budget made-for-video movies. I'm so glad I didn't see it in the theater. It's a lot like ""The Water Boy"", and that one was just as stupid. I couldn't get myself laughing one bit. If you happened to buy the DVD, I bet you'll never look at it a second time. Personally, I never care for Adam Sandler."
2,Movie bad dvd good,I am a big fan of Adam Sandler but this movie ... I hope their next movie is beter. Anyways the dvd stuff is better then most dvds. If you like the movie get it if you never saw it and collect dvds don't get it.
2,Sandler's Worst,"There are some funny moments in ""Little Nicky."" Sandler plays the title character who is one of Satan's three sons. He must go to Earth to bring his brothers back down home. Nicky doesn't fit in New York with his slurred speech and ugly look (damn, is he dumb or what?). A nice woman named Valerie (good name) treats the stranger kindly. The basketball sequence is the best part with a kid telling the audience he was there for the 'honeys' and the cameos are all funny. Regis in the only good thing he'll ever do and Reese Witherspoon as Nicky's mom. But everything else is for the children. Rodney Dangerfield still doesn't get respect and you'll see why. Demons in a pillow fight? A talking dog that sounds like that stupid puppet dog was way too annoying. Just skip to the funny parts. Sandler has definitely made better movies."
5,The most HiLLARIOUS Movie of all time,"This is one of the best comedy movies ever. Adam Sandler, (the Water Boy, Big Daddy) was SUPERB. He hillariously played as the ""Spawn of Satan,"" with a voice pedamaent. When his two older brothers escaped from hell it was up to Little Nicky to capture them and save his dad from disenagrating. He fially figurs out that he has to find the evil within to capture his brothers. But with his mom being an angel things get a little tricky. Nicky slowly begins to release his evil, and his good to create one of the best comedy movies ever. With everything from talking dogs to flying like SuperMan, you have to see this movie.P.S. It will really make your head spin!"
1,SO Terrible,"I love Sandler, but this is by far his worst movie. Words don't even describe. If you have never seen this, do yourself a favor and don't waste 2 hours of your life."
3,Funny....let stupid.,"I saw this flim at my friends house. It was funny, but some parts were very stupid. Great flim once you get past the stupid parts."
1,I really didn't know they made movies that were this awful,"I thought Sandler's ""Mr. Deeds"" and ""Happy Gilmore"" were awfully stupid movies, but then I had the misfortune to sit through ""Little Nicky."" I realize now that ""Mr. Deeds"" & ""Happy Gilmore,"" by comparison, were absolute artistic masterpieces.My God, how does a movie as uniformly awful manage to get past even the executives that approve a script for production? It just boggles the mind how bad this was, on every level. How respectable actors such as Harvey Keitel could associate themselves with this cinematic vomit is also mind-boggling.This was a truly painful movie to sit through, and is angling for a spot on my hallowed list of 10 All-Time Worst Movies (alongside Mannequin & Baby Geniuses). I still feel the nausea induced by this garbage."
4,Hell at it's best,"This was a funny movie that if you failed to laugh at can only mean you've lost your sense of humor. It was unique and the references to ""Happy Gilmore"" are certainly fun.I think the main reason some people didn't like this film is because it showed that there is a heaven and a hell and that tends to scare those that deny or dispute their existence. So merely based on their own theological views, they denounce this film instead of accepting the premise and enjoying the comedy. And there is plenty of comedy throughout the film.Simply pop this film into the DVD and don't try and make the film fit your version of theology. Just enjoy the laughs."
3,a good rental,"funny movie, but just ok. wouldn't buy it unless you could get a good deal on it, so that makes it a good rental."
1,dumb and pointless...,"I think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Pointless and dumb. I took it out of the DVD player half way through it. I didn't laugh, at all, during the parts I did see. There is nothing else I can say about this movie...definitely pass on it. It's not even worth the ONE star!!"
5,Great Movie,"First of all, I think Adam Sandler is really funny, and this is probally his best movie yet! Some of the characters in the movie were Nicky, Valerie, Cassius, and Adrian. This movie was so funny, I could not stop laughing when the guy on the street stole Nicky's flask and Nicky went up to him and yelled: ""GIMMIE BACK MY FLASK"". Then after he was yelling at him the guy on the street said: Take you dumb a** canteen GOOFY!!! That was really funny. If you want a really funny comedy get this movie."
5,You will have one hell of a good time.,"Little nicky is a very funny movie. It's about satan's son who goes to earth and makes all kinds of trouble. He falls in love with a woman and tries to stop his evil brothers. This DVD is fully loaded with great features. Buy it, you will love it."
1,"um, no","Wow, was I ever dissapointed, this is just another wonderful example of how ignorant the people of this country have become. I mean, even Happy Gilmore was a bit of a stretch but this proved it, idiocy sells. It makes me mad that people like Adam Sandler make millions while doctors and educators scrape by, god bless america I guess."
1,"Sandler's worst movie ever, one of the worst Major Motion pictures Ever.","What can really be said about this movie? It was like a bad Saturday Night Live skit, but in a full length motion picture. I don't ever think I've seen such a deplorable character as Sandler played with Little Nicky. I was annoyed throughout the entire movie at how idiotic the character was, and how very unfunny he was, despite this supposedly being a comedy.Allen Covert's character was almost equally as disturbing, as a supporting role. I was looking through some of the reviews that people had written about this movie on here, and I was dumbfounded. Everyone is entitled to their opinion of course, and if you enjoyed it, then I'm glad it entertained you. But for me, it was just about the worst thing I've ever seen. I can think of very few movies that were worse than this."
4,Funny man Sandler does it again!,"In Little Nicky, Adam Sandler plays the speech impared spawn of the Devil. When his two older and smarter brothers freeze the gates of Hell, Nicky is sent to Earth to bring them back. This is no easy task since his brothers can posses anyone. Lots of humor adds to the already hilarious plot. So if you loved Big Daddy or the Waterboy be sure to check out Little Nicky!"
3,Not his best,"This was not Adam Sanders best, It had too much gross out humor (Which I'm not a fan of in the first place.) But there were alot of funny cameos that were good and Nicky's dog was hillarious. If your an Adam fan it's a must to have, but if you're not you may not like it."
3,a little too silly,"This is basically Adam Sandler going all out and just being plain silly the ENTIRE time. In fact there's honestly not a single normal moment throughout the entire film, haha.I thought some of it was funny, but the constant silliness got overbearing after a while. Talking bulldogs, people sitting on tree branches late at night watching women change clothes, and Adam Sandler's character repeatedly dying and coming back to Earth were just a few things you can expect in Little Nicky.Adam Sandler's character wasn't exactly the most interesting or the funniest character you'll ever see, but it provided a few solid laughs here and there.Not a classic by any means, but for a little bit of entertainment it's alright."
2,More Adjustment Needed,The PTC Black TV Ceiling Mount is sturdy and easy to install but it would be nice if had a little more adjustment capability especially in regards to tilt angle.
1,"old bottle, different ingredients?","Love Cabaret's salty/sultry scent, but the bottle we received from Amazon had different ingredients than our previous bottle. It wasn't red (as was the previous bottle), and it smelled watery and stale. Big disappointment, but thankfully, Amazon refunded us.Guess the takeaway is that when you buy perfumes long-distance, you may get a cheaper version, but you may also get an old bottle, which was, we assume, the case with this."
3,just ok,"this perfume is not bad, but it is not like wow. it smells a little strong, like old ladies perfume. at all not bad."
2,Shame on Universal,"This is one of the worst professional DVD's I've ever received. The compression is so poor that chunks of color information are clearly visible even during the opening credits. Also, it comes with a warning that it may not even be playable in computer drives. What's most frustrating is that the print is obviously a pretty good one. The levels are all good. All Universal needed was to take some care with the compression of this dvd. I can excuse the fact that there's no booklet or further information about the film aside from the unimaginatively designed front and back of box. This would be fine if the dvd looked better. But it just looks completely cheap and unprofessional. Worse than Netflix quality. For this they have the nerve to charge nearly 20 dollars! What a shame!!!! I wish Universal would just let Criterion license the film and do a proper release. The film, which is very curious and great, deserves a whole lot better!"
2,More Fellini than Casanova,"Artsy, boring and empty. Unsuccessful in delineating Casanova, but maybe Fellini had his reasons. Mediocre print. Speech does not match the actors' lip movements. Score is good - Nino Rota is always fun. I say not a masterpiece, but to each his own. Read the Casanova memoirs instead."
3,Track Listing,"Seeing they don't have the tracks listed, I thought I would use this review area for that. 1.Rock On 2.Cover Of Love 3.Photograph 4.Straight From My Heart 5.Was It Nothing At All 6.A Question Of Time 7.Heartbreak Monday 8.Turn From My Love 9.A Touch Of Gray 10.My Mistake"
4,Best Cheese EVA!!!!!,"Was It Nothing At All is the best song ever! Brings back happy memories of being a teen, love it!"
2,Butternut extact,I asked for pure butternut flavor my wife said it is not the right kind to make her cakes with
4,A Sweet Story about Independence and Homecoming,"This book is a collaborative effort between Miska Miles, a Newbery-Award winning author, and is the first of Jim Arnosky's tremendously popular picture books. It tells the simple story of a little duck who sets out on her own to see a little bit of the world; she meets a frog, a rabbit, and a pig, and they each take her to see their homes. She begins to get tired and thirsty, and when the frog takes her to see his home (which turns out to be hers as well) she is well content to rejoin her flock. This is a sweet book about independence and homecoming, and includes some nice barnyard and outdoor scenes rendered simply but beautifully in black, white and brown."
5,"A must see film for any homo sapien, especially those who live in Oregon","I felt really bad for the families in this movie. The actual method used in this film to end ones life looks like a fairly peaceful way to go. I think others should not judge people who are dying of an incurable, painful disease and want to use the methods depicted in this film to end their suffering. I don't understand the difference between taking so much morphine for pain that you MAY stop breathing or taking the barbiturates used in this film that hastens and insures the end of your stay here on planet earth? The end of life option used by people in this film looks like the more logical one to take from my perspective. That is if you have the cash and live in Oregon."
5,Exit...,"If a human being is really sick or just fed up with his/her life, or just wants to exit regardless of the reasoning and does not want to go on any longer, why does such condition requires permission or opinion from others... I was told long time ago that if my mother had an abortion, I would not be here. Well if an individual is already here then shouldn't that person have the right to choose what is quality or dignity when it is in regard to his/her own life, when that person is not harming the public and his/her death has nothing to do with others... Why are words like dignity or humanity even necessary...As long as we have those radicals who feel like that is OK to belong to a group that they preach to something while their priest is abusing a child of the same sex with no penalties, travelling from one church to another, there will be no reasoning. Thanks to all those individuals in the documentary who shared their lives while on this planet. Peace."
3,interresting,"makes you wonder why more states don""t go there. i would recomend taking a look at this. moments of sadness. Does not help anyone with Alzheimers"
5,I love the smell and quality,I just love the smell. It arrived right on time for my meditation class. This brand is very reliable and good quality.
2,Old and crumbly :(,This product was old and crumbly when I opened the box. I read a review about that warning but decided to try anyway. Disappointed I did. Doesn't stay lit at all and so they are useless to me. Did not return due to the fact I didn't want to hassle paying more (shipping) for a product that wasn't worth the initial money spent. Plus it took almost a month to recieve.
4,"Very strong smell, ok if not scent-sensitive","Nag champa is a classic. It is however, very strong. Even after it's out, the scent lingers on fabrics. As far as the product, it arrived on time. Packaging was fine, shipping time was fine. I think in the end I could have found it the same or cheaper around here after shipping, but that's ok. Nag is fine for now, until I can find a lighter smelling incense."
2,Not the same?,This Nag Champa smells a little different then previous ones I have purchase. It does not smell bad just a bit more floral than I was expecting.
5,Such a calming wonderful aroma,"This is the ONLY brand I will buy. Don't fall prey to cheaper versions of this incense, you will be disappointed."
5,Gotta love this incense,"After a recent trip to the Orient, I am now hooked on incense - and this is a terrific product. Very high quality and ... the scent takes me back to Vietnam and Thailand in an instant."
1,Really bad quality,"Sticks turn off after just few minutes of burning, and when you try to light it again it doesn't work either. Bad bad bad quality. I will look for another seller."
3,The formula has been changed!,"Buyer Beware. This formula is not the same as the 40gram kind, for some reason it smells like it has been sprayed with cheap perfume, and toned down. I cannot smell the Nag Champa smell when I sit beside the burning incense. For those of you that have burned Nag Champa, you know sitting 2 feet away, you should be able to smell it burn. It smells kind of like Nag Champa.. but not really. =( they even raised the price...bad deal. Bring the real stuff back! I was comparing my 40 gram package to my 100 gram package, and the 100 gram pack had a sticker that says ""new"" on it, the 40 doesn't, so I guess that is our proof.Why change a formula that has worked wonders for years?"
2,Bad Bad and Bad :(,This is the worst nag champa I have ever bought.. the smell is completely wrong and it never stays lit.. seems like it is from 4 or 5 years ago.. will buy from my uasual person nagchampa.com better prices and better product
5,Oh wow.,"When I opened my mailbox the fragrance was almost overwhelming. I've never smelled a box of Nag Champa that's so strong-even with the same manufacturer. I'm burning my first stick and it's amazing. It has been burning for about 20 minutes now, with about 10 minutes to go (from the look of the stick.) I'm very happy with my purchase."
5,Good strong scent.,These burn slowly with a nice strong scent. I would say they are best on the market in terms of value and quality.
5,Doesn't get any better,"If you enjoy the smell of Nag Champa this is by far the best ive ever had. Price vs Amount, you definitely get your moneys worth"
2,Suspicious,"I just purchased a 100gm package from 'old glory' as supplier. I've been a nag champa burner for YEARS, and these incense smell off. Not sure if it was a bad batch, or if they're not genuine. I won't be buying these online anymore."
4,"Nice incense, good shipping.","I was hesitant to buy this because of the negative reviews, but since it was ""fulfilled by Amazon"" I trusted they would take care of me if it was bad. However, I just noticed that the seller for my purchase was Tom's incense, and it is now Prasad Gifts, so I wonder if that makes a difference. The incense itself is perfect, packaging is fine, and the smell is not bad when it's burned.Fragrance is so subjective. I like Nag Champa, and I think the formula has changed over the years (it's been maybe 5 years since I have bought it) but it still smells nice to me. I also like Super Hit, and another brand of NC that comes in a red box but isn't made by Satya Saibaba - I might like the red box more now, since the blue box formula doesn't quite take me back to the Dead shows I used to love so much!"
3,Nag Champa Lover...,"Growing up in hippie Seattle, if you didn't have Nag Champa, there was something wrong with you. I always passed on the rose patchouli, though, as I preferred a shower to dousing myself with something that smells like 5 months of body odor concentrate. Getting back to the incense, this original scent and the super hit with a vanilla hint are my faves. The reason these got only 3 stars is because when the incense arrived, it was not intact as expected. The powder had fallen off to the point there was a pile of it in the box, which would fall out and get everywhere whenever I got a stick out. I haven't had that experience when buying in person, so it must be the shipping that did it. Disappointed, but will try again and see if the results are the same. If so, I will only be buying from a store, in person from then on."
5,A great way to start your incense experience,"Nag Champa Incenseis the gold standard.The incense has many exotic notes of spice with a sweet undercurrent. Several of the scents are a tad sharp, but not unpleasantly so. I have found the scent perfect for meditation and concentration activities.This incense blends well with others that may be burned at the same time. Other earthy or woodsy would complement very nicely to be enjoyed during physical activities."
3,2010 Nag Champa,"I have purchased two 100 gram boxes of Satya Sai Baba Nag Champa over the past couple of months and both have very different aroma's. The first box smells really great, with a more aromatic smell than the second. The second box has 2010 on the seal and inside flap of the box, where the first box I purchased does not.I'm not sure if they have changed the formula, but the second is nowhere near as good as the first. It doesn't smell as sweet and is more woody smelling. It also looks different; it's tan instead of gray.I think I'm going to stick with the Red Nag from now on because it seems the Satya Sai Baba changes from one box to the next."
1,Item may be fake and not the real deal,"Satya Sai Baba Nag Champa is some of my favorite incense, so when my local store ran out of stock I decided to give Amazon a try.I bought this from Prasad Gifts via Amazon fulfillment. The box was two years old, and when received the majority of the incense had fallen off the sticks. The incense and the box did not smell like Satya Sai Baba Nag Champa (the box from Amazon was slightly different than the one from the local store, suspect counterfeit).Please do not buy into the few reviews saying the formula has changed to explain away these discrepancies. Boxes I have purchased less than a month ago with 2012 stickers on the box smell just as great (and the same) as this incense smelled in the early 1980's when I started using it. Something is very amiss with this supply.I hope Amazon takes this review into account and investigates the stock and the supplier, bad show all around."
1,SMELLED TERRIBLE!,"I had to stop what I was doing and write this review, I just received this incense in the mail and I immediately lit up ready to enjoy the aroma, and I was hit with the most horrible smell ever. I don't know if this was just a bad batch, but it smells terrible. I have been using this specific incencse for years, and I know exactly how it smells, and this was just the most awful aroma ever. I have yet to contact the seller, but I plan to do so. I am very disappointed with this being my first time ordering this incense for it to be so disappointing. I want either a fresh shipment, or my money returned. I am warning everyone, please be careful when ordering, it may not be what you expect."
1,old incense,i purchased this incense for the price and the reputation. i was so disappointed when i opened and smelled them. the incense practically fell apart when you touched it. very hard to keep lit and very little fragrance. the only thing i could think of is the incense is very old. i wish i could get a refund!
3,are they change the fragrances??,"I just receive it today 9/7/2012 ,i've been using this for pray for over 3 years and almost run out of it and I purchased another however the smells is completely different,I highly prefer the old scent"
5,Nag Champa Incense Sticks,"Same brand I've been buying for a long time, just now, easier to find and cheaper to buy (as compared to in my town)."
3,Wont stay lit 1/2 the time.,"Purchases of this item from other sellers have been fine, but these wont stay lit 1/2 the time unless I pre-burn the whole stick."
5,Great smelling traditional scent,"One of my favorite scents, try to order from Tom's as he delivers current product and has fast shipping. It's important to get fresh properly stored product as this type of item is susceptible to mold which obviously ruins the product."
2,Very Disappointed,"Sadly the incense i received did not live up to the standard i am used to for nag champa incense. i had read over all the reviews both the positive and negative. Unfortunately the box i received was filled with tan colored sticks instead of grey. Normally the first whiff of a nag champa incense makes me go ""aahhhhhh,"" but not this time. They were difficult to light and to stay lite. The scent was like burning wood, a soapy aroma, and just a hint of the wonderful nag champa scent that i love so much. i am not sure why this happened or if anyone is to blame. After all they come in a sealed box. i don't know what the seller could have done to make sure the incense were fresh and of top quality. It is the kind of item i won't be ordering again online. i have returned them for refund which i anticipate will go through without a hitch."
1,Love the scent - cheap cheap product,You get what you pay for - I just received and burnt the first stick and my main room spells like a fireplace with a closed damper or a smoking lounge - but 2 or 3 rooms away its heavenly -poor production for a great scent
3,not sure,"I first bought a box at a store when vacationing in Martha's Vineyard,MA,I loved the aroma!!!so when back at home,I decided to buy a bigger box,found it at Amazon,the box looks exactly the same,same label,same size of the sticks,but the aroma is stronger,not bad,but more intense,strong,as I said,not bad ,but not the same."
5,Incense-3,This was a very good value and I am glad I purchased it. Not only is it pleasing but I can use it more often without feeling I am burning money.
5,A new way of looking at news,"People don't read every word in newspapers, they ""get into them every morning like a hot bath,"" Marshall McLuhan is quoted in this book as saying. Kevin Barnhurst describes that hot bath in this very readable book, which presents what academics are learning in this field in terms the average person can readily understand. The newspaper is an environment, and its layout, design and photography shape our perception and absorption of the news. The medium may not be as totally determining as McLuhan believed, but the form certainly shapes the content, and it does so it ways that even people in the business (as I have been) don't really understand. Seeing the Newspaper helped me to understand why this matters, and how it occurs."
3,"History of Pointe Coupée Parish, 2010 edition","Excellent from historical documentation perspective.I purchased the book because I was hoping to obtain information about my grandparents (born in the late 1800's), great-grandparents and great-great grandparents, who were born and/or lived in that parish. None of the 6 surnames were mentioned anywhere in the book, however. One of my great-grandfathers owned the only commercial establishment in Jacoby, LA; a general store and post office, but that was not mentioned, either. Elsewhere, I have located Census Records, Court Records, records of weddings that took place at one of their plantations and St. Stephen's Episopal church records that mention my ancestor's names, but I was hoping to get a bit of their day-to-day history from the book."
1,Poorly Made Beware!!!,"I gave the fun value 5 stars because my son loved the toy and had a ton of fun with it, if it wasn't for my son I would give it 1 star. I brought this batman for my son who loves Batman, but after a short time the arm broke off. Not worth the money."
5,"Mmmm, More Gateau, Please!","Eliza's Gateau by Lisa Cach, one of the four stories in Leisure Books new anthology, Seduction by Chocolate, is enchanting! And, like naive Eliza, an American tourist travelling alone in Europe, I, too, fell head over heels in love with sexy Sebastian and his to-die-for accent! The mood of the story is sweet, yet also very sensual, in the deepest, truest meaning of the word. The reader will taste the chocolate, morsel by luscious morsel, will hear the soaring music, note by glorious note, will climb the spiral staircase, step by arduous step--and thrill to sexy Sebastian's kisses. A beautiful, sensual romance, Eliza's Gateau is as satisfying as a ballotin of the finest Belgian chocolates!"
5,FOR THE SWEET TOOTH,"SEDUCTION BY CHOCOLATE consists of four short romance stories which would be enjoyable to anyone who believes in love, but especially to those who can attest to the aphrodisia connection to rich chocolate. These stories, by different authors, each with unique writing styles, offer us ""feel-good"" vibrations. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it as curl-up along with your favorite box of Godivas, Sees, Hershey's, Hawks, Wolfgang's, etc... etc... etc... Umm!"
1,worst piece of junk ever. do not buy.,"When it worked, it was great.But it doesn't hold a charge. I have used it maybe twice, and now it doesn't hold a charge (not sitting around for two weeks, doesn't hold a charge for even five hours).Don't buy this product. Not worth it."
3,"great idea, mediocre reliability","The overall design is well layed out. One exception being the jumper calls that are stored separately from the base unit. I really loved it, until it stopped holding a charge. Now its a big paperweight, and I really don't know how to dispose of it responsibly."
4,Doest the work!,"Yes it works! I was able twice to jump start my dead battery. But don't expect it to do more than it's meant to do. For instance, it wouldn't operate a 60 watt light bulb for more than 20-30 minutes."
3,Good,"I know it's supposed to be ""doom"" and everything, but it's heavier, harder, and more melodic than what I've heard of most of the Candlemass CDs. It doesn't sound as foreboding as the first CD. The lyrics are still dark, but I like the music.I'm not a ""Candlemass-head"" and only have 2 CDs. I listen to 80s metal, hair bands, etc..."
5,ASTONISHING... Best Death Metal ever,"Absolutely the best death metal I've EVER heard. Precise, well-crafted tunes, excellent arrangements and production, soaring vocals, superb musicianship. I am a lifelong musician and I can really appreciate when things are done well. Metal has never been done better than this."
4,Good Album......but,"I bought this album after reading what people had to say about it, but while i was wating for it to arrive, i bought TALES OF CREATION. Now that i have both i think i prefer TALES. I think the production is a little better and the songs on TALES are a little more catchier. WARNING!!!! DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THE SELLER, 'IMPORT_CD'S' !! I ordered this cd from them on March 26th and i still don't have it! They took my payment that day and i live 30 min from them! I bought it (again) at my local record store. So i would recomend only purchase it through Amazon."
2,Look for the Kodak 'Pre-Charged' cells instead,"Do not confuse this item (Kodak Max 4 NiMH 2100 mAh Rechargeable AA Batteries) with the newest 'Ready-To-Use' / 'Pre-Charged' NiMH AA cells such asSANYO eneloop, Rayovac Hybrid, andKODAK Pre-Charged. Please observe that the 'Kodak Pre-Charged' cells come in white cases, while those 'Kodak Max' cells shown here are in green cases.'Ready-to-Use' NiMH cells have lower capacity (2000-2100mAh) compared to traditional NiMH cells (2500-2900mAh). However, the advantage is that they have extremely low self-discharge rate. Typically they can retain 80% of full charge for up to 1 year in storage. In comparison, most traditional 2500mAh NiMH cells will completely self-discharge within a few weeks.The Kodak Max cells offered here have lower capacity of 2100mAh, and yet it does not offer the advantage of low self-discharge rate. Therefore in my opinion, there is simply no reason to get those cells."
4,Decent.,"These batteries arrived without official packaging in a plastic bag. However, when charged just enough they last for a really long time--I took video of two concerts with my digital camera when the indicator said there was half a battery life left. They last a long time if charged well, but they also lose some of their charge if they lie without use for a few days."
4,Functioning as they should!,No problem so far with this product. Advise removal of batteries from charger as soon as they have been charged.
2,Tremendous Toy Trucks book by Les Neufeld,"None of the prints were actual size. Instead of just coping the print and glueing it to your material and then cutting, you had to lay out each piece onto your material. Very slow process. If I had known this I would not have bought it."
1,Blew out the circuit,"First time used on 1600w, blew circuit, ruined curling iron. Don't get this product."
1,Overheats too easy,"I used this product two or three times before it stopped working completely, and every time it would heat up REALLY fast, almost to the point of being too hot to touch. The attachments are still useful, but the converter is crap."
4,Works Well But Has Limitations,"I have used this product extensively in South America (Uruguay, Argentina, Peru, Ecuador). The primary use is to recharge my camera, Bose headset and iTouch. I've had no problems with these applications. However, I am purchasing it again since my girlfriend correctly tried the 1600 Watts setting for her hairdryer which melted the prongs on the voltage unit which attaches to the adapters. So, I would purchase a dual voltage travel hairdryer if you need one. Also, due to its weight, once you connect the appropriate adapter, the voltage unit will tend to pull out of the wall outlet. I put something underneath for support which can be a problem. I would not leave this unattended and per the instructions - ""IMPORTANT: Do not leave Foreign Voltage Adapter in wall outlet when not in use. After using, remove Foreign Voltage Adapter from wall outlet."""
4,Reggae Balladeer,"On this collection of covers, the reggae balladeer John Holt wraps his silken voice around standards like Never Never Never, Baby I'm A Want You, Help Me Make It Through The Night, Mr Bojangles, Killing Me Softly With Her Song (an interpretation of the Roberta Flack classic) and Lobo's I'd Love You To Want Me.If you like smooth reggae like Dennis Brown, you'll love the voice of John Holt. Disc Two contains a number of cuts recorded with the Paragons, amongst which On the Beach and The Tide Is High are My favorites. There's nothing rootsy or challenging here, just soulful reggae interpretations of some great songs. Pleasant and relaxing."
4,Just as advertised,"Product worked just as advertised for our 46"" LCD TV. Made of quality material, simple to hang on the wall, and easy to adjust tilt. Would definitely buy again for other TV's."
4,Nice Bracket,"Used this on a 46"" Samsung LCD. Rock solid, smooth movement when tilting. Stays in tilted position with out tightening tilt locks. Came with all the accessories for just about any LCD, even nylon expander washers. Would buy again.P.S. Get help lifting your TV on to the mount, jeez it was a heavy TV."
4,"Solid, simple, and successful","This Sanus wall mount bracket is solidly constructed with a reassuring amount of heft that provides the confidence one needs to entrust it the task of holding that new flat panel TV. It is simple to install provided one measures carefully and has on hand the basic tools recommended. All the needed hardware was enclosed to make it possible to mount this bracket to wall studs or to a concrete wall (glad I did not have to do the latter installation though). Once the bracket is in place, you can adjust your viewing angle up to 12 degrees and have a bit of room for lateral positioning the TV as well. My son and I successfully installed both the bracket and TV in less than an hour, and much of that time was spent measuring and positioning before we committed to a location."
4,love it!,"Get this! I have a 37"" LCD that I installed in our bedroom. I couldn't believe the satellite TV installer wanted $100.00 and a popular installation service wanted more than that to drill some holes and drive some screws!This was a piece of cake to install - if you have some basic ""handy-man"" skills. A stud finder and a level is essential. You will need 2 people to do it-it could be a little tricky holding it on the wall while mounting it and hanging the TV.Once installed, you can change the height of the TV some, and the tilt angle makes viewing the TV from our bed a pleasure.The price was right on Amazon - a similar item sold in a popular home-improvement store was near $100.00...and I had it delivered in a couple of days. Thanks Amazon!!"
4,Hang it on the wall!,"You need a bracket to hang a flat panel on the wall (so my wife says). Sturdy, easy to install. It took two of us to get the flat panel on the mount. Best of all the price was right. These items are usually over priced. Had to shop around. Found best deal at Amazon..."
4,Extremely easy!!!,"The mount was extremely easy to install and I had none of the spacial issues others had discussed when using this mount with a Sharp 46"" Aquos. The materials were very high quality and the bolts were much more substantial than other mounts I had compared this mount with. I would buy it again in a minute!!"
2,Buy a Cheetah Mount Instead!!!,"I bought this wall mount for my 54'' Panasonic Plasma TV and had (2) of their ""cheap"" lag bolts snap in half (w/one half in the wall stud) during installation. If you make the mistake of buying this mount, I highly recommend you go to your local hardware store and buy quality lag bolts. In contrast, I bought the less expensive Cheetah brand mount and had zero problems. Do yourself a favor and buy the Cheetah mount."
1,We never heard from the sellers,"We received the item incomplete, with missing bolts & small pieces, some of the pieces were wrapped on Ziplocks ,the item was used and with marks and scratch on it. It wasn't "" like new"" as they advertised..We contacted the seller 3 times to return it and receive the printed address label and refund.We never heard from them.AMazon took responsibility and refund the total of our payment .But we r still with the undesirable item at home."
3,Excellent Mount and easy to install.,"Very easy to install but the screws given in the mount are not fitting properly, specially for sliding side ways. The screws to install the mount works fine."
5,"Well built, easy to install","This is a heavy duty frame that has no trouble holding the 46 inch Sony I placed on it. It took all of about 30 minutes to get the bracket on the wall and the TV onto the bracket. Really simple installation all the parts I needed were in the box.The tile feature is okay. It really doesn't move too far, but it is nice that you don't have to loosen and/or tighten the knobs, it just stays where you put it just by moving the TV itself.I'm very satidfied with this mount."
5,Great Wall Mount for the Price!,"This is a high quality wall mount at a great price. It was very easy to install and it came with all the necessary tools and hardware. I used this mount for my 46"" Samsung."
5,Very nice mount,"Used this to mount my 52"" Sony LCD. Talk about easy!. Once you mount the bracket to the wall and the mounts to the TV, you simply lift the TV to the bracket, hang by the hooks, center and tighten the set screws. The only difficult part was the weight of the TV. Highly recommended."
4,tv tilt mount,"Since we got it up it has been fine. Before that several screws had broken, we even had to go to the hardware store to get better screws."
4,Much thicker than my new flat panel,"Look carefully at the dimensions: this thing adds 2.5"" to the depth of your TV. My new flat panel TV is only about 1"" thick, and I didn't want to add another 2.5"" to the overall thickness. I'm returning this to Amazon without even trying to install it.Oh, I read through the manual. The good news/bad news is that there are only about 100 words of instructions in English. It's not much to read, but it's not much help either.I'm giving it 4 stars for apparent product quality -- the metal is very beefy and I'm confident that it would hold my TV safely. (However, based on the other reviews, if I were going to install this bracket, I would go get stainless steel screws to replace those from the factory.)"
5,Tried and True,"As a former Geek Squad Home Theater installer, I've used and recommended this mount to hundreds of my customers. This mount is VERY well constructed using heavy materials and has a very solid feel of quality. Also, the ease of installation is awesome. I give this mount as well as all Sanus mounts a lot of praise."
4,Good Product but a couple pointers,"This product worked well for our 50"" Samsung. A couple pointers however... The hanger will adjust well horizontally (L or R) but does not adjust Vertically (U or D). You must be VERY level on your hole drilling because it will affect how level your tv hangs. Also, if pulling the wires thru the wall and coming thru the circular openings, keep in mind, the hangers on the tv CAN NOT slide past the wires - they will catch - so your left/right adjustment (which is a great feature) will be limited once your wires are pulled thru."
4,HDTV mount for larger plasma TV,"This is an acceptable mount for a HDTVpros: sturdy construction,inexpensivecons: no pattern for mounting I had to make one myself but no big deal- helpful in looking for studs.outlet for HDTV as well as cable have to be made outside of mount not within the mount unlike other models"
4,good product .. terrible installation,"the product is good and allowed me to get my 46 inch TV up on the wall. However, getting it up was an ordeal:1. The instructions are confusing, preferring unclear pictures to words that explain what the pictures are even about.2. The kit arrived with missing hardware to install the mount on the wall (supposed to be included). It required a call to Sanus customer service to understand precisely what was missing and then a trip to the hardware store"
4,Easy to install,"Very easy to use. We have latham plaster walls, and my husband and father-in-law hung our 46-inch plasma in about an hour. They include every type of screw imaginable. The biggest part is finding the studs, but there's nothing the wall mount can do to help with that. Very good buy."
5,TV WALL MOUNT,"This mount exceeds the quality and strength needed for mounting a TV.Comes complete with enough hardware to handle any mounting combination, had enough hardware left over to start a mini hardware store.The TV that was installed was a 46"" Sharp Aquos. Sanus is a high quality wall mount and purchased here was far below cost at any retail store. Would highly recommend."
5,Easy and well documented,"This stand arrived in a box that was totally demolished by UPS. The stand was luckily packed well enough is in its own packaging that it was not damaged in the slightest. The stand took no time to organize and arrange on the wall and TV, all the parts are labeled in the bag and the manual. The safety bolts are really annoying (so just don't put them on?) -- they use an allen wrench and are vertical at the bottom of the stand against the wall, so you end up turn a trillion times. All and all the biggest difficulty was getting the normal stand on the TV to come off (we used magnets, a vacuum, and eventually an electromagnet to get the off). All in all great stand."
2,"Beware of using this with a LG 52LB5D 52"" LDC Flat Screen","Purchased this wall mount for a LG 52LB5D 52"" Flat Screen HDTV. The wall mount is only 29"" wide, LG TV wall mounting supports are approximately 33"" center line. So it may fit most 52"" TV but not this LG model. Make sure you check your TV's Wall Mount Location prior to purchasing this unit. The Box states it will fit up to 56"" TV."
4,Very good so far,"We didn't know what mount to use and shopped around a lot before making this purchase. The price was much less than we would pay elsewhere. It seems to be very sturdy and does the job. It tilts which is nice, but it is sometimes difficult to do so. That may just be because my husband tightened it too much. It holds our 46 inch bravia XBR6 perfectly. If we had it longer, I would give it all 5 stars. Its perfect for what we need, and at great price."
4,Beefy,"This unit is very heavy duty with thick steel stampings and a black powder coat finish. This may be heavier than necessary for even the 55"" flat panels making it a bit harder to install for the novice. Lag Bolts and Lead Mollies are included if you are going to mount it to wood or block wall construction. Just mount the backing plate to the wall, mount the 2 vertical top hooking brackets to the TV, lift the tv so that the hooks engage on the backing plate and install the safety screws so that it wont lift off the hooks and you're done."
3,Tilt Function Ain't What you think,"This is a sturdy well made bracket. My main problem with this bracket is adjusting the tilt. The nobs for the adjusting are virtually unreachable once the TV is on the wall if you have a 52"" TV. To get your arm behind it and to tighten the nobs once its on the wall impossible. I could only reach one side and overtime it gets lose and I have to stretch behind and tighten it again. The other nob is way to far inside on the opposite side to even reach. Also, installing and tightening the locking screws for the rack if the TV is tilting downward virtually impossible. Note. the placement of the cables on the backside of the TV will also limit the angle of tilt you can achieve (unless you cut out a hole in the wall for them. Bottom line: very limited tilt angle available depending on the application."
5,Great Product!,"This is a great product, sturdy and solid. I was nervous about mounting it above my fireplace but it has worked out perfectly. It holds my 43"" toshiba flat panel tv. Great product, the box was badly damaged, but nothing was wrong with the product. Thanks!"
4,"Works great, but get your own screws","I have metal studs and I mounted a panasonic 54 inch TV with this. I used 8 Toggler toggle bolts in the drywall and they would have held the thing in by themselves, but to be sure I also put 4 steel screws in the studs. The included bolts are hex bolts and really difficult to sink into the wall- you should get your own screws. I don't know why they don't just include regular screws.Overall, for the price this is a great deal. Best Buy wants more than twice as much for the exact same model. Only issue is the screws."
5,Great Mount at a great price,"Buying this mount though amazon was a great deal. Mount came with everything I needed to mount my 42"" Vizio. First time using a wall mount and it was easy to install."
5,Perfect,"Could not ask for more out of this set up, and amazon for having it so reasonably priced.I looked for a tv mount for my 46inch lcd at retail, and could not believe what they try and charge for a piece of metal.Ordered from amazon, got it very quickly, had it up in about 30mins, and saved about half over Best Buy. Or even Wally world for that matter!"
5,Very Pleased,"I bought this wall mount to use with my new 42 inch LG HDTV. It took all of one hour, from opening the box, to finally hanging the TV on the wall. The instructions were not very detailed but we were able to figure them out. The construction is solid and I have not had any problems with it since installation. It has been a great space saver, as the TV is in a smaller room with space at a premium."
5,Great Product and excellant hardware,"This was the first time I have hung a flat screen TV and was pretty wary of it being sturdy enough. I have a 2 year old daughter who loves to handle things. I had the plasma secured to the wall studs with metal wire but was still uncomforatble with the idea. 75 toddlers die every year by falling flat screen TV's so I decided to take the plunge. The hardware, base and the mounting hook (that attaches to your TV) looked very sturdy out of the box. Most plasma's would need the M6 and M8 (heavier screws) screws to attach the hooks to the TV. Mine needed the M6. I attached the base to two wall studs as my studs (for some weird reason) are 24 inches on center instead of 16"" on center. Screwed the base to the wall with 4 lag bolts and have 2 in spare but that seemed sturdy enough. Hanging the plasma on the base was pretty easy with 2 people. My TV is 89 lbs. The adjusting screws to tilt the plasma are awesome.I would highly recommend this product."
4,Great mount for 52 inch TV,"I bought this mount because I wanted a simple mount with a tilt so I could more easily access the plug area if needed. This mount is sturdy, well built, very/easily adjustable, and comes with a lot of different screws for various mounting situations. My biggest problem with it, however, is that with my TV the knobs for the tilt are tucked so far in that they are barely reachable by anyone with average adult sized hands. They also decided to use plastic washers with the knobs, so they can get loose with adjustment. With all the high quality, metal pieces they include with this mount why they decided to skimp on that one part is beyond me."
5,Easy to install,This was very easy to install. It came with the necessary hardware to install this mount on many different surfaces and attach it to a multitude of televisons. I'm very happy with this product.
5,Simple yet Perfect,"After doing some extensive research on a mount, I finally decided on this unit from Sanus. I didn't need a swivel because of the layout of my room, but wanted a tilt. I couldn't be more happy. The product came with tons of mounting hardware for any and all types of surfaces. I mounted it on a brick fireplace and the installation was extremely fast and easy. The only ""hard"" part of the installation was the safety bolts at the bottom of the unit. They provide an allen wrench, but its very difficult to try and thread those with limited visibility, as well as having the tv in place. I would highly suggest a long screwdriver with a hex adaptor to simplify installatoin. Overall, it's a very simple product and yet works perfectly for my situation. I highly recommend it."
5,Great Mount!,"Sturdy! It is holding up a 42"" LCD. It hides well, and is built with strength. Was rather simple to install, but goes easier with 2 people. Especially when you are trying to hit the right level balance. Once we hit the mark and tightened it... been perfect!"
4,GREAT,"great item, sturdy solid braket, the only thing a could take away from it is that it does stick out from the wall a little but overall great product."
5,Speedo,"Wall mount is exactly what I was looking for. Great mount for price. It mounts very close to the wall and offers enough tilt for versatile vertical placement. It does not offer horizontal tilt, but did not want that anyway. Very satisfied."
4,Cabinet Guy,"I bought this sander to replace my Porter Cable. The first one I recieved ate belts like crazy. I called Dewalt, they said bring it in. As I live 3 hours away from the nearest servce center, I called Amazon and was sent a replacement overnight for free. The replacement works great, as with any belt sander dust colection is so, so but it works well, is heavy enough to do the job but still light enough to use all day."
1,Belt adjustment defective,The belt sander was supposed to be reconditioned by Dewalt. Tried to adjust belt tracking could not. Took it to the DEWALT REPAIR CENTER and the mechanism was bent. This should have been checked and fixed at the Dewalt reconditioning center. Beware of reconditioned tools.Factory-Reconditioned DEWALT DW433KR Heavy-Duty 8 Amp 3-Inch-by-21-Inch Variable Speed Belt Sander Kit with Dust Canister and Case
5,acrylics,"this book is so glossy. i love the photos and the techniques it displays. it makes you appreciate acrylics. I haven't encountered another book like this. it is NOT about how to paint better. As i see it, it has to do more with how to manipulate acrylics to create beautiful surfaces. it also has a lot of info about the kind of acrylics. if you want to know more about acrylics i highly recommend it!what is more, i like this positive approach toward acrylics, because really it is so dull having people underestimating the material."
2,Too technical,"I borrowed this book at library thinking it would tell me how to mix my acrylic colors, how to do underpainting, etc. However it is totally a technical book on how acrylic paints are made and such, not useful to a person wanting to just learn to paint pictures! I also tried the book ""Acrylic Revolution"" which was interesting if I wanted dozens of different ways to use acrylics other than painting a picture--returned that book. Still looking, am open to suggestions."
2,Teck review of acrylics.,I want to be a better painter. Way too much info on teck end. Should have returned it.
