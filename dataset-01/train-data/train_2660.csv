3,Flexible silicone,"A flexible silicone pot holder! Yes, yes I have to buy another to have a complete set. Expect a long wait this almost a 15 day wait. Yes Yes I own many pot holders cloth and silcone. but these pot holders I actually look for! They combine the best of both worlds; The heat resistance of silicone with the flexiblity of cloth. And Yes this is not clumsy to use! Your gonna love the the ease, the flexibility and the heat resistance.A Pot holder worth more than a dollar! Go figure...."
2,Not for small hands,I wear a size 6 USA women's shoe and have correspondingly small hands. My hands are lost in this mitt making it very clumsy to use.
4,A standout album,"I remember the night still, feeling so bizarre after just having seen the filmMartyrsfor the first time, and following that with this fantastic album. It's something unique, spawned from the culture of Greece, and combining black and death metal touches with chants, pipes (I think, I might be mistaken on this) and choirs. Plenty of it epic and compelling, but working on a deeper level - the instruments are used exceptionally, there's a lot of attack and metal here, but the songs are broader than your average headbanger album. The standout track on this is without a doubt Nemecic - hearing the enthralling melody kick in on that, combined with the chanting vocals and thumping drums, gets to me every single time. That's the way it ought to sound! Highly recommended, especially if you're looking for something unique but still ""metal"" enough."
1,I second Junk!,Ordered this fan and the switch lasted one week before it broke. Called the company and after paying an additional $15 the second fan switch lasted one day. Run away from this companies products!!!!!John B. from MA.
1,Junk!!!,I ordered this item and did enjoy it. However I have only had it over a month and it has ceased to work.DO NOT BUY!
1,Looks are deceiving...0 stars!,"This fan looks fabulous but worked terribly. After only a few weeks the blades started to hit the side of the casing on the oscillate mode. Tried everything to make it stop but nothing worked. I was forced to keep it on the stationery mode but after a week or so, the blades started to hit the side of the casing on that setting too. This fan is much more expensive than the others, presumably because it is stainless steel, but it is the worst kind of cheaply made junk. You are warned! DON'T BUY!!!! It's a rip-off!!!!"
5,Fan is fantastic,"I don't write reviews on products much but I felt the need to repudiate all the bad mouthing this product has received. I've had the fan for 2 weeks and the wife and I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase. The fan looks nice and pumps out air almost as well as an industrial fan. For those complaining about the noise, go change your depends or brush your dentures. EVERY FAN MAKES NOISE. This is a retro style fan with a steel blade. Of course it's going to make a some noise. But don't fret, this fan DOES NOT sound like a lawn mower. If you are looking for an oscillating fan that looks good and blows out some serious air, I recommend the Soleus FSM-45."
2,Loud metal fan,"As a fan... I guess that it works in that air blows through and subsequently cools... but it sure is loud. Much louder than my plastic 16"" Holmes fan. And much more expensive. Some of the parts feel a bit cheap too. Whisper-quiet nowadays doesn't mean whisper-quiet anymore I've noticed.The lowest setting is kinda high too. The highest setting... kinda ridiculous.Mmm... I guess it looks alright."
1,RV016 is an unstable 13 port router,"We purchased this on recommendation from Linksys sales support that it would accomodate 14 downlink ports. As supplied the RV016 is a 13 port router with 1 dedicated DMZ port and 2 WAN ports (5 of the other 13 ports can be reconfigured for additional WANs). Further discussion with Linksys technicial support indicates that this device has stability issues and does not work well with Linksys switchs. It locks up periodically and requires a systemwide reset. Do not expect any support if you buy this product. My calls were directed to India and the Philipines and I was asked questions including ""what color are your cables?"""
3,Little disappointed,"We used to have the RV082, which comes with 8 port PLUS one Internert and one DMZ. Bought this one thinking that it'll have 16 ports PLUS one internet and one DMZ. But look again... it has 16 ports including the Internet and DMZ. Lucky I only need 12 ports."
4,Savings,"I initially went to Radio Shack and purchased the router in question. It was going to take several days before I received it. I went home and looked on Amazon.com for the exact make and model number. I was shocked! The router was almost half the price of Radio Shack and would be delivered overnight. Needless to say, I cancelled Radio Shack and ordered from Amazon.com If you take due diligence and check the source and reviews about the merchant, you can't lose.Bob"
5,A complete packaged solution for a network,"I liked the fact that the router and a 16 port switch is integrated. Best of all the VPN, although a little cumbersome to install, but is working great. My previous Cisco VPN router would not let me have a VPN client stay connected all the time and would occasionally drop the connection. QuickVPN that came along with this router hasn't gone down a single time since I've installed it and so far pretty stable. Would recommend for a standard network management."
4,Great router for the price,"Worked great for what I needed it for and has been very stable, for the price. Needed a cheap router for setting up an office for hotel style offices. Setup was pretty easy and simple VLAN setup was easy as well which I needed. Have not really used any of the other advanced features such as multiple WANs or DMZ yet. I too am familiar with Watchguard, for this situation the RV016 was MUCH cheaper and easier to setup and I did not have to deal with Watchguard's stupid licensing issues. The down side was the combined total ports of 16 but only needed 12 so not a big problem."
1,Better know what you are doing if you buy this.,"I have no complaints about the direct product. It works great if you know how to set up the device. If you need any assistance from Linksys Customer Support, I will guarantee you will get frustrated and demand a refund. The Customer Support is TERRIBLE and a one star rating is the lowest I could rate their service. Wish they had half star ratings. I was fortunate and able to stumble upon a soultion by means of trial and error by tinkering with the router. If you are new to routers, don't get this one."
1,Poor for big LANs,"I was forced to get three of these. Each one was used on a hotel with people coming and going. All had firmware upgraded. During dead seasons, the product would work fine. This is when 5-10 people per day were using it. When 50 or more people were using it, EVERYONE ONE OF THEM WOULD FAIL, AND REQUIRE REBOOTING, often multiple times per day. Linksys support TOLD me that if more than 10 people were on it at a time, it would fail miserably. They all did. If you don't mind rebooting in a crowded enviroment, or only have 5-10 people who need this at a time, and simply need a redundant form of internet access, this will work fine. If your requirements are bigger, choose peplink."
1,file sharing problematic,Was never able to reestablish file sharing while using this router. Tried various fixes. Was using XP on desktops and laptops. Was told they offer no support for file sharing. Sought advice elsewhere. None of it worked. Returned the item.
1,VPN this !,I spent 2 days on the phone with Linksys trying to make this thing work. It just does not.The router/switch/firewall features work fine. When it comes to VPN... forget it. It is NOT compatible with any respectable IPSec VPN client.Authentication options are not suited for mobile users with Dynamic IPs (you can not specify to connect from just any IP address) and their own VPN client (QuickVPN) is incompatible with Nortel and Cisco VPN clients (they can not be installed on the same computer) so if you are using any of these softwares to connect to other VPNs don't buy this product.
1,Don't install any new firmware,"I made the mistake of installing the new firmware, and now I can't get any kind of internet connection from the outside. FTP, Remote Desktop, etc., all failed to connect. The new firmware blocks all incoming connecitons. I talked to the Linksys tech support several time, and couldn't revert back to factory default firmware. I had to bring in my home router, an RV082, which I hadn't updated, to replace the one in the office. If you want a router with bullet proof firewall, I had got it in the drawer."
2,Colder than a January Chill,"On a gradual slope headed downward that has been the condition of her last 3 novels, Lee wants us to accept this improbable and depthless novel. The characters lack so much that their movements, thoughts, actions and feelings never involve the reader. Furthermore the reader has no stake in the plot or the suspense, probably because neither exists at any level. Lee used to construct tough, well conceived, and rather gritty novels. Her latest efforts, however, are too washed-out and weak."
5,Arrive quickly.,"Which is good, because my son waits until he is OUT before he tells me he needs more. These reeds are recommended by the entire school district."
1,Caution,"The writers of this series, are a collection of self professed ""prophets"" and ""apostles"" of the Toronto Blessing, Latter Rain, Word Faith, and other heresies variety."
5,Wonderful Prayer Aid,"Tonight there was a brief but powerful prayer time at a Christian gathering where Wesley Campbell spoke. He had everyone take this book of Bible prayers and walk around in a circle, praying aloud the prayers. A great idea for corporate or personal use!While the print is not tiny, I would suggest publication of larger print editions for Baby Boomer use in dim meeting places. :)"
5,life changing,"I can say for me, that this book has changed my prayer life, esp. the THEOPHANIES. I have seen Wes and Stacy Campbell in person at our church in Ft Worth and they are the real deal. Wonderful speakers, make the Word of God come alive.Have a ministry called, BE A HERO for orphans in Africa. I love this book and do recommend it."
1,late,I have not read the book yet but I am giving it a 1 because after 3 days it still has not shipped!!!
1,Same as Vol. 1,"I love good ol' Hank, he is usually consistently funny and unapologetically crass. The problem I have with this CD however is that it is nearly identical to volume one. I realize that these were two nights in the same venue, but I assumed since they recorded them separately they would contain different material.Not so much.Even volume one has some of the same stories as the ""Rollins in the Wry"" and ""Think Tank"" albums. I know Rollins sticks to a loose script and therefore every show is different and unique, but these were just not varied enough to warrant spending $10 on the same thing.If you bought volume one, don't buy volume two. Otherwise, you might be ok."
4,It's old but cool,"I saw this when I was a kid and I admit it was disturbing, but not as disturbing as when my mother bawled me out for putting a cabbage patch kid stamp on my sister's hand when we played store, a seven year old just doesn't need to hear about the mark of the beast that way."
3,"Works great for installation, not so good for first time removal","Like the title of my review says, this tool works for installation. However, if your SKS is as it came from the factory, this tool might not work to remove the crossbolt the first time. The reason is that the factory crossbolt nuts are usually heavily staked into the crossbolt itself. I broke one of these tools trying to remove the crossbolt nut before I realized it was staked. The plastic just isn't strong enough to provide enough torque to overcome the staking. This was the case on both of my SKS's, a Russian and a Romanian. I ended up having to use 90 degree snap ring pliers to get the crossbolt nut off. Once the cross bolts have been removed for the first time, this tool works great for reinstallation, and subsequent removals thereafter."
4,Worked great for a while,Didn't last very long and I was VERY careful with it. For the price though i would say it's an acceptable deal. I would buy another.
3,Not long enough,"Energy Suspension has great products, but this one, although specifically listed for a 2004 mustang, does not have end links long enough to fit. The product also showed up with missing bushings. Amazon's return policy helps with the missing parts issue, but not the length of the actual end link bar."
3,"I enjoy a challenging puzzle, but ...","This puzzle just about got the best of me. If there hadn't been two of us putting it together-- each with different abilities -- I'm not sure it would have been completed.There were two reasons it was so difficult: 1) the colors in the puzzle are different from the colors in the picture AND on the box (instead of yellows and creams, there are creams and rosy beiges and browns-- and purples that don't show up at all in the picture on Amazon), so the picture on the box is of limited help. 2) the pieces are squiggly/odd shapes and many are smaller than the pieces in most puzzles.Usually when I complete a puzzle there's a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction. When the last piece went into this one, there was just great relief that a chore was done."
3,love mcescher,"Beautiful picture - I love this piece by M.C. Escher, but I wont buy another ""Go Green"" puzzle from Serendipity Puzzle Co. the pieces are very loose fitting - you barely bump your puzzle and it buckles then your fixing what you've already done. Also the cheap cardboard somewhat de-laminated so it doesn't lay down real nice. I glued my puzzle together to hang on the wall but even after a good coat of glue on the front ( I use wax paper underneath ) after applying a coat on the back the glue seeped through to the front due to such loose fitting pieces. Also whats with not giving Mr. Escher any credit - his name doesn't appear anywhere on the box! Oh well - I still love this picture so I hesitantly gave it 3 stars."
3,needs better packaging,"The boards are made of MDF and particle board, so basically any little bump on the delivery truck will cause damage to the materials. Edges were chipped and parts were broken or missing because the box was also ripped. So basically it needs to be shipped in a better box. Assuming it came in perfect condition, the wardrobe is a decent size and fairly sturdy. I will need to call for replacement missing parts. I don't think it's worth what i paid but it was one of the cheaper options out there, so as they say ""it is what it is."""
4,great but the drawers are very shallow,Works great but the drawers hardly fit anything inside. The knobs are really cheep but easy enough to swtich out. Very pleased with the closet overall!
4,wardrobe,"this item was really easy to build and was just what i needed for my daughters room, I would recommend this for anyone who is handy and needs a decent wardrobe"
3,Looks are deceiving,"Purchased this for our son's room. Package arrived with multiple points of damage on corners despite cardboard and foam packaging. It was even punctured in one spot (the board at the back of the wardrobe. Assembly was no problem - very clear instructions. Drawers are not as deep as the wardrobe! This was a disappointing fact since we needed all the storage space we could get. They are about 7 inches shorter than the depth of the wardrobe. Had to install a wood block in the large area for the doors to hit against, otherwise the doors would close and go too far inward. Disappointing purchase but we had no time to shop around once it arrived. Drawers do move smoothly. Son says, ""one drawer goes in farther than the other one."""
5,How can you say anything bad?,"This Iron Maiden tshirt is my favorite- you want it then buy it, no hesitation. After 2 years I decided to turn it into a tank (it was too hot one day,) still love it though."
1,magnetic mailbox covers,The mailbox covers faded in about a month so that they are no longer decent. I have been trying for close to a month to get a refund but have been unsuccessful. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!
5,modern fairy tale,"It's often difficult to find an author who is willing to address the ""dark"" side of girlhood. It's virtually impossible to find an author who will address the NEED for that ""dark"" side. My daughter and I both laughed out loud and gasped in horror as we read this book. When it was over we had lots to discuss. Things like when it's good to be angry, how to express yourself and exactly what it means to be a good little girl. I believe Ms. Banks was urging girls to be balanced in our increasingly unbalanced world."
4,This book was okay.,"I liked the book for the most part but I think that the author could have put in more about Angela. But besides that, it was GREAT!!! For any of you who have a sister or brother that you don't get along with, read this book and look back on your arguments and say to yourself, they were MINOR!!!! Also if you just want a book to read, this would be the one!!!"
5,The Best Book In The World!,"I loved this book so much.I couldn't stop reading.Its about twins. One is good and one is very,very bad."
4,Angela and Diabola,"I've borrowed this book from the school library.Well, what I can say about this book is,it's very interesting. It is about a pair of twins. One is good(called Jill),another is bad(called Jane). But later their parents made them to be christian and the good one called Angela while the bad one called Diabola. Everyone loves Angela much and hate Diabola. When the twins grow up, they have power to do good things and bad things. Of course, the good one do good and the bad one do bad. Their power were so strong that the bad one can make people sick by using her eyes and the good one can cure them if she want. I think this book is really interesting because no book I've read have got such extreme case."
3,"Hand me the Phillips, no the other one...no, the OTHER one","37 Phillip's screw heads and not one Allen head.Seems like they didn't try very hard to cover all the bases.I end up using this about...once a month? Whereas I use the built in screw bits about 7-8 times/week.On the positive, the case is very nice. I do like that quite a bit. I keep looking at it forlornly wishing it held something more useful than another phillips head screw bit."
3,Impossible to set the channel!,"The primary flaw of this device relative to the alternatives is that you cannot set the channel (A or B) of the device. It comes *manufactured* as A or B. And when I ordered two of them I got two A devices, which makes one of them virtually useless."
3,A fine product,"I inserted the unit in a waterproof box behind a masonry wall. It works consistently at about 50 feet. I wanted it to work at 75 feet (which would bring it into the house), but it consistently does not. Not bad--and I really didn't expect it to work through the box and wall--but not as perfect as I would have liked."
4,Does what I needed!,"I ordered this to turn on and off Heat tape on the roof of my house to melt the snow. I ordered 2 and they arrived promptly as Amazon always gets it right. However, one worked and the other did not. I went online and filled out the claim and printed the label for return. Amazon even paid the return shipping. As soon as you finish the return paperwork they ship you a replacement , so it was back in 2 days. Now everything works great. I see cheaper products out there but this seemed to be a little higher quality, so for a few bucks I went with the Skylink. I don't regret it.Skylink WS-100 Wireless Remote Control (CH A or B)Skylink WS-100 Wireless Remote Control (CH A or B)"
1,NOT A GARAGE DOOR OPENER,"Although the item is described as functioning like a garage door opener, it cannot be used as a garage door opener."
5,Great For Old Ladies Like Me,"When arthritis hits and it becomes more difficult to reach light switches from your rocker-recliner, these guys work great. I keep one with my remotes in the living room and have another one by the recliner in my bedroom."
4,It works!,"used the product for controlling a lamp in the same room, works great. Did notice that the product requires a short delay ( 2-3 seconds) to switch on then back off again."
1,Did not work,"After reading a few reviews of simular products I opted for this one to control my Boxee Box in the bedroom, which will not turn off remotely. When it arrived I plugged it it and it worked perfectly. However, when I came to turn the power on in the evening it would not work. I unplugged it and tried again the next day but it would not work, so have returned it to Amazon. It could be that we were unlucky but have decided to go for another brand as a replacement."
5,OUTSTANDING ITEM,"I PURCHASED THIS WIRELESS REMOTE CONTROL TO TURN ON AND OFF A WATER PUMP IN A BIRD BATH. I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS REMOTE CONTROL AND EVERYONE IS AMAZED HOW WE CAN TURN ON THE PUMP IN THE BIRD BATH. AT CHRISTMAS, WE PLAN TO USE THIS REMOTE TO TURN ON/OFF THE LIGHTS"
1,Don't buy...,"This product has a range of maybe 20 feet. The claimed range of 100 feet was not even close to reality.Also, the switching has a relatively slow delay which leads to pushing the button multiple times because you're not sure if the switch activated. This means that the switch would turn on and turn off repeatedly.Overall very frustrating and disappointing."
4,Works as described,"Not much to this product. Press button to turn product on, press off to turn it off. So far has worked as promised every time. I have it about 12 feet from the light I want turned on and off."
4,Nearly perfect for my application,"I purchased this product to enable me to cut off power to my garage door opener (while we're traveling) without pulling out a ladder and unplugging the opener's electrical cord. It works like a charm. Has only a small drawback: in an electrical storm, power fluctuations can cause the power to the opener to cut off when I don't want it to . . . but this is a minor irritation. The remote makes it easy to reset the power."
4,Works great most of the time!,"I bought this remote control because we have woods directly behind our house and at night when we let our dogs out they like to run into them to use the bathroom. With this wireless remote control I was able to put a floodlight out in the yard and shine it into the woods to light it up when we take them out. I used double sided tape to mount the switch to the door so its easy to use without having to constantly plug/unplug an extension cord. This switch works 99% of the time, the other 1% sometimes you have to hit the button more then once to get it to work. 'm using it at a distance of about 30 feet from the receiver unit, But it really does work well, just remember to let it hang with the outlet side facing down to keep water out as that seems to be the biggest gripe. But for my purposes it works well."
5,Love it!,"I've had this for over a year and it still works great. Simple, but reliable remote at a great price."
1,Won't Work for Me,"It says it is good up to 100 feet in the advertising and on the package. I could get it to work up to about 20 feet in the direction 90 degrees from the direction I needed. In the direction I need it would not work beoynd 5 feet. It would not work through an aluminum fence, even when aimed between the uprights. It would not work through a screen and over the fence at about 30 feet. It is totally useless to me.I want my money back. How do I return it for a refund?"
5,Effective,"I replaced one (white box, different than this) that stopped working after about 10 years of use. This one has better range than that one and teh button works easier and the first time all the time."
5,Exactly what I wanted for my garage,I have a detached garage with some cool neon lighting on the back wall and I have this control mounted by the front door. All I have to do is hit the button and my neon lights without having to walk around the garage to turn it on. I love it!!
1,Hardly works,It's supposed to work from up to 100 feet. It barely works at even ten feet. This thing is ridiculous.
1,Not impressed,"Well the button would only operate part of the time, maybe 80% of each time it was pushed. Then when it would switch, you were 'hit and miss' on whether the sensor would actually receive the signal. This intermittent functioning was from 12' away, no great distance there I'd say. I tried pointing the switch (button/remote) directly at the sensor unit (receiver) and it was still intermittent, probably working under this scenario 65% of the time, but this didn't meet my needs at all. I am very disappointed with this product."
1,Remote Switch,"I had great hopes for this remote switch. It did not have the power to work through walls as some had claimed that it could do. To bad, it would have been helpful. I returned it for credit."
1,Worthless,"This unit was totally worthless from the day I received it, thought it might be the battery so I bought a new one, still didn't work unless you held the remote within 2 inches of it. RH Luther"
1,"Very short range, not as promised",I bought this remote because it said that it would go 100 feet and I needed it to go at least 50 feet so I don't have to walk outside to turn my lights on. Unfortunately I have to walk within 25 feet of the plug to get it to work.
2,Wireless RF switch,The product works fine as a one unit stand alone switch. I was attempting to controll 4 units simultaneously and was shipped 3 units on one frequency and one on a different control frequency. There was no way of ordering 4 alike and no way to reprogram the units. They should have DIP switches for flexibilty similar to ceiling fans or operable skylites.
1,Won't turn off!,"Unfortunately I ordered this product in July and did not get around to unpacking it until January. When I installed it I was pleased at first to see the light turn on. However, when I tried to turn it off, it stayed on--and on--and on. The remote has a red LED, so I knew I had the battery installed, but I checked to make sure it was installed correctly and then I tried a new battery. Instructions say to mount vertically with receptacle down, and that is exactly what I had done. I checked the voltage where I plugged it in to see if I had inadvertently damaged the unit with overvoltage, but it was 120 volts on the nose. If you buy one of these, try it out immediately so you can return it if it is defective."
1,AMAZON SUCKS!!!!!!!,"I HAVE E-MAILED YOU 5 TIMES ABOUT THIS PRODUCT NEVER WORKINGTO THIS DAY NO REPLY I WANTED TO RETURN IT FOR A NEW ONE BUT SINCETHERE IS NO WAY TO CALL TO SPEAK TO ANYONE AND NOBODY REPLYSI GIVE UP!!!! I'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING WITH YOU PEOPLE AGAINBYE!!!!!!!JOHN BRENNAN126 ANNADALE ROADSTATEN ISLAND, N.Y.10312"
5,Works exactly as advertised,"Works exactly as advertised. The range isn't great, more like 30 feet but does exactly what it says it will do."
4,Automatic Remote,This product works extremely well. The distance I used it was approximately 100 feet.. It turned a light in my porch on and off..
1,Great when it works...,"I don't know what is wrong with my setup but i already sent one back and now the second one stopped working the same way after a week. The remote wont do anything anymore. I cant turn off the outlet at all. It will work once in a while, its not a range problem since i am trying with the remote 1ft away from the plug.When it worked, it worked great. I am going to return it and buy another brand!"
5,Does excatly what I want it to do.,"I use this to turn on lcd lights that I attached to the back of my 54' plasma. When it's dark I like a little ambient lighting but it was to much of a hassle having to get up reach the back of the tv and turn on the light. So, I bought this remote and it works great. I don't even have to point it at the TV, it always turns on and off when I push the button."
2,Worked ok but...,"The switch worked ok, but something in our area kept tripping it. We were trying to use it to help staff in our office to reset our internet router when things werent working. The router is locked in a phone room, so we figured we could get this wireless remote.However, once installed, it just kept turning itself on and off. We ended up having to get a custom switch wired in instead."
4,Works as expected,"Works pretty good, the only down side is that sometimes the button is not responding to the push. But other then that it works great and the remote is small."
2,Good while it lasts.,"Bought the Skylink WS-100 Channel A wireless remote control for a lamp in the office in the middle of October 2011. It was used a couple of times a day, 2-3 times a week and worked well, even through the walls, from the rooms next door at least 15-20 feet away. However, in the middle of January 2012 it stopped working. The remote still sends a signal, but the receiver is no longer doing the ""switching"" i.e., it's dead. Customer support (I e-mailed them) was responsive, but the cost of shipping it to California for replacement is almost as much as the unit itself. For a few dollars more I got a Woods 3-pack off Amazon that works just as well. Bottom line, it's good while it lasts, but it's not very robust."
1,Worked great for a week,Worked exactly how I wanted to use it. I was using it to control the power to external drives for my Dish DVR. Unfortunately it quit working after a week. Fortunately it died in the on position.
5,Very nice shoe!,"I bought this in a 9.5M because they didn't have it in my size which is a 9M. But I have to say that in spite of this, it fits me very well.I wore it for the first time on the graduation day of my daughter, and all eyes went straight to my shoes!I really glad that I bought this."
4,Great Book,"This book is very useful for beginning analysis of temperament and personality types. A little heavy on spirituality, but that's actually a plus to me."
4,A Pretty Good Book.,"If you ever wonder why you simply don't get along with certain people, especially when you have to like in a work place, this book can help you understand the reasons and clairfy what you are up against. It's also useful for just understanding people's behavior in general.Dr. LaHaye has a keen insight into different ""personality types,"" or ""temperaments,"" and he hits almost all the bases and their characteristics in these pages. The only problem for me, personally, is that the book is loaded with Christian dogma and the author feels that any problem is solvable through the teachings of Christ. I suppose if you're an unquestioning Believer, your troubles are over."
4,Very Happy...,I was very happy with the service from this seller and the condition in which the item arrived. The entire transaction was very good and I would purchase from this seller again. Thank you.
5,great book,"I have owned a copy of this book for many years and have greatly enjoyed it and benefitted from it. Recently a friend at church mentioned something where I replied from this book. She said, I would love to have a copy of that book! I offered to purchase one for her, and so I did ~ from Amazon.com. and she was thrilled to get it, thanking me profusely."
4,Spirit Controlled Temperament,This book was very insightful. It was also helpful and encouraging to see how one can change from the inside out. I would recommend it to anyone discouraged over what they are like or if they are stuck in a rut.
5,Book worth reading,"The minute I got into this book and started reading about the different temperments, I was nodding and saying, ""yea, that's me. Oh yea that is me, too."" The best part is I often wonder if I could ever change or get rid of my weaknesses. Now I realize that it is a part of my temperment and I don't need to change it but find out how to turn my weaknesses into God's glory."
1,Read Huckleberry Finn instead,"Remember the King prancing around as a reformed pirate, at the camp meeting out in the woods while the Duke ripped off the print shop back in town? The King made out great that day, 80 dollars and more. LaHaye's made a lot more with this book. The King and the Duke wound up getting tarred and feathered, ridden on a rail.When's Lahaye going to get shown up for what he is? How come 19th Century Arkansaw had more sense than 21st Century Middle America?"
4,Stress Reducer,I've used other yoga videos and this one really blows the other ones away. I use foam mats when I workout to the dvd and this really makes a difference in the comfort for my knees and back.
5,Meditation in movement,"If ""sitting on the cushion"" is not what works for you, maybe trying this yoga DVD could do the trick?I find it to be a meditation in / with movement.I truly love it. I do not use this DVD for physical exercise so much as for mental / spirit / mind exercise."
2,power yoga??,"Rodney has his own style, but it moves away from power yoga. He starts on the floor which makes it difficult for a good warm up."
2,Boring!!!!,"I use several of Rodney Yee's DVD's and really like them. I have found that the titles usually are on target, but not this time. I tried giving this one a chance, but I just don't like it, I find it so boring that I can't center on the activity. My mind wanders back to work yesterday, today and tomorrow."
1,Boring..........,"This did absolutely nothing but bore me to tears. It is so slow, not to mention extremely easy to do. Do not bother with this video if you have done yoga at all....it is very basic."
3,Where's the burn?,"I will give Rodney Yee points for the graceful and meditative practice he offers his latest DVD, but I did not feel any burn. Much of the yoga practiced here in the US is too fast paced with an emphasis on athleticism but this workout was not challenging for me. I would have given it 3.5 stars but that is not an option. This is a good practice if you are feeling tired and stressed, but the claims of added muscle mass and bone density are definitely overstated. This might be a good starting point for people who do not want to do more advanced postures and would like to spend more time on perfecting basic asanas like Warrior I and cobbler's pose.One quibble I have with his productions-- since he uses a voiceover, why can't he mirror his actions so that he provides more accurate instructions?All in all, it is not a bad offering but if you would like a challenge with some meditative balancing postures, try Yoga Zone's Power Yoga. Lisa Matkin is a great instructor."
3,Are you a contortionist?,"I read a review that said a beginner could do this tape. Not true unless you are very flexable or a contortionist. Rodney Yee is a master that has been doing yoga for over twenty years. He is truley great. This tape is way past my ability, I just started doing yoga and I am not flexiable enought for this work out."
3,Effective but too slow,"He does a great job facilitating the yoga, but it's way too slow for me. I do think it's good for beginners and people who have a lot of patience."
3,Very Easy,"This DVD is for beginners and will not provide a challenging practice for anyone who has been working with Power Yoga: Total Body or Energy Balance Yoga, two of Rodney Yee's other recent DVDs. I was disappointed. If you are looking for a practice that emphasizes basic postures, however, you will like this DVD. Rodney Yee is a great teacher; ""Yoga Burn"" was probably not the best title for this particular practice, since it implies that the postures and pace are advanced. They aren't."
4,There's a burn... surprisingly!,"The first few times I did this video, I was focusing on the poses and didn't really feel the burn. It all felt too slow-mo, compared to Bryan Kest's power yoga videos. But at about the sixth time I did the video, I ""slowed down"" even more, and realised that the slower you do the poses, the more difficult they become, and the more burn there is. Which made it quite strange cos now, my practises on this video feel alot more difficult than the first few times I did it. It could be all in the mind. But as Yee proposes in this video, it is all about ""mindfulness"". So for those who don't seem to feel any ""burn"", how about trying it this way - do it even more slowly, be in the present and focus fully on what you're doing, and on the sensations, and maybe you'll start feeling it - which I did, in my arms and thighs!"
1,music,"Love Rodney Yee, hate this DVD. Unfortunately, the music is SO VERY loud, I could barely hear the talking, and yes, I could just turn the volume all the way up and then I would be able to hear the instructions, but the music is so bad and unpleasant I wanted to turn it OFF, not UP. For that reason, a big disappointment..."
3,"No ""yoga burn"" here","No doubt Rodney Yee is a true yoga specialist, however, I did not find the title of this DVD to be true to its name. At no time did this ""yoga burn"". In fact I have added it to my DVD shelf of yoga DVD's for days when I need a gentle practice or am not feeling up to par. I would classify this DVD as beginner and not let the title mislead you into thinking this DVD is physically challenging."
2,Not very much Burn involved,"I love Rodney Yee, but this title is a misnomer. The asanas are not very challenging, the pace is very slow, and there is more stretching than strengthening. If you are looking for a practice to get your heartrate up and your muscles burning, this is simply not the one."
3,This is NOT for the beginner,"I was given this dvd as a gift after asking for a yoga dvd and mat set. I've done yoga at the gym before, yet would still consider myself a beginner. I also suffer from Fibromyalgia. I found this dvd to be too advanced, and was left unable to do the next pose only 10 minutes into it (he was folding in half!!!). There is no explanation of the poses, and I had to watch and then rewind to see what I was supposed to do next. I gave the dvd 3 stars, because I have enough understanding to know that if I was more advanced, this might be a great dvd. I do appreciate how Yee goes into and out of each pose in repetition, creating a total workout. But, all in all, this dvd is meant for someone who has done yoga for some time and has knowledge of the poses - and is flexible enough to get into them."
3,More lukewarm than burn...,"I own a number of Yee's DVDs, but was a bit disappointed in this one. It follows his same usual postures, but at a much slower pace. This was nice for a change, but not what I was expecting. It was not as challenging as I had hoped."
5,Yeah Rodney!,"I started using this DVD when I was fairly new to Yoga and found it perfect for learning poses (because they are repeated) it also helps with better form and flexibility. It is perfect for someone ready to go into the intermediate and next level (beyond beginner). Easy to follow and easy poses, however you will get a good workout, there is burn. I rapidly progressed onto his Power Yoga DVD from Yoga Burn, but still do them both."
5,Wow!!!,"Fantastic! Easy enough for intermediate yoga students but challenging enough for advanced! Relaxing, challenging, perfect! I feel so relaxed despite sweating through this dvd. Wish he included modifications though."
4,Teaches the Basics,"If you go to Georgia Tech, and have never programmed this book will not be enough. If you want to learn the basics and plan on practicing many different programs it's great."
4,Good Reference,"I recently took an accelerated programming class for college where they started us learning the 'C' language. The text books the college handed out were way too complicated for a beginner to comprehend. It was as though they were intended for someone who already knew programming. I wanted something that a novice like me could comprehend without the material sounding too technical. So, I bought the 'C All-In-One Desk Reference to keep practicing and it is way much easier to understand. The next programming class is expected to be C++ for Dummies, so I may end up getting that one as well. With continued practice, I'm going to get where I'm going!!"
5,"Good, friendly intro to the C language","This is a nice intro to the language and some of the basic aspects of the C library. You're not going to learn any data structures or advanced techniques but you'll get a solid treatment of the basic mechanics of the language and familiarity with the C standard library for dealing with files, doing math, manipulating and calculating times/dates, etc, all in a down-to-earth presentation style with some corny jokes thrown in to keep the mood light. Definitely a nice beginner's book. I had some experience before picking it up but it gave me a nice refresher and taught me a couple tricks.One note: they call it six-books-in-one for some reason but it's really just a big book with six parts/chapters. None of these parts would stand on their own. But whatever, that's just marketing and doesn't detract from the fact that this is a good product.Happy coding!"
2,"A Rainbow Path, Kay Gardner CD","I did not particularily like this CD of individual songs broken by long pauses. The song choices did not seem to fit the chakras and the vibraphone was extremely annoying as were repetitive musical phrases.I have heard other works by Kay Gardner that I did enjoy. This, however, was not one of them."
5,Excellent Healing Music,This music promotes the balance of the bodys' energy centers and is a gift to the ear as well. Each selection begins with the tone of a particular chakra which leads into a composition written in the key of that chakra.Its good for background music in body work as well as just anytime listening. The music is easily felt vibrating in the chakra centers and energies and emotions can be felt shifting and changing with each piece. Its nice to know we can listen to music that will enrich and balance us on many levels. Thanks Kay!!!
5,Its a HUG for the ears,"I have listened to this music many times and HAD to add it to my ""on the go"" collection! Wonderful healing music!"
5,in each country and in each house I hve one!,"This product is very easy to use very practical and can't live without! As a mom of twins and for every change I wash them, I keep one in the bathroom next to the sink so directly I put them on it and dry them and put ther pampers or even change their clothes! I even bought one to put it in my mother's house! It is very safe when they are still babies but don't forget NEVER leave your baby unattendant!"
5,Freberg Rules!,"It is wonderful to hear all the classic Stan Freberg recordings. As a long time fan, I was impressed with the quality of the recordings and roared with laughter on almost every selection. Stan Freberg's brillant, creative mind produced some of the most original work ever heard on radio or seen on tv. Aspiring writers need to listen to these CDs to understand how satire, and fun work together to sell products and entertain. The videotape and the packaging are two more reasons to buy Freberg (if you need more reasons) Freburg rules again!"
5,Great pair of shoes!!,"This pair of shoes has been the most comfortable pair of work shoes that I have ever owned. When I first recieved them I was a little worried because they were a little tight in spots, but they quickly broke in and formed to my feet like a good quality pair of shoes should. I would definatly recommend these shoes."
4,Rich and sparkling!,"If a Celtic harp for Christmas is good, then a harp and cello are even better. The deep, smooth richness of Virginia Kron's cello perfectly balances Kim Robertson's sprightly, sparkling harpestry. The musical fare is similar to that of Robertson's solo album, ""Celtic Christmas""--traditional holiday carols, many familiar and few obscure, but all enjoyable. Peaceful, resonant and calming, this is perfect music to counterbalance the dreaded holiday stress. Put on some warm slippers, sip a fragrant herbal tea and let yourself unwind. Robertson and Kron also recorded another lovely album together, the warm-hearted ""Gratitude"", which is sure to win your heart as well. Two other gently entrancing Christmas recordings worth checking out are Norland Wind's ""December Journey"" and ""One Wintry Night"" by hammered-dulcimer player Jerry Read Smith and his wife, flutist Lisa Maria Smith."
2,Problem with the Shutter,"I bought the camera... It worked fine, nice pictures, for the first year while it was under warranty. After the first year H1 and H2 started to come up. That means take it to a camera repair shop. Which in turn informed me that there was a shutter problem. A $140.00 to $210.00 shutter problem. I can buy a new camera... [but] Who wants to buy a new camera every 2 years. These are supposed to last. At least 5 years when taken care of as this one was. So buyer beware, you may be spending the same amount of money in the next year or two to replace it or fix it."
5,Clear pictures!,"I have never had a better camera. I have found that Kodak 800 film works the best for this camera. The camera automatically adjusts to the lighting and has excellent outcome in the pictures. This camera is VERY easy to use. I choose it over an SLR. Great for anywhere, anytime, and especially anyone."
2,"Would be great, but...","While traveling in Europe this summer my wife and my camera was stolen in Cologne, Germany. I went to quite a few places looking for a replacement and decided to get the ESPIO 160 (German version of the IQ Zoom). Less than a week and a half later the camera broke while we were in France and it was Bastille Day. No stores were open where we were so we lost a day of some of the best scenery we saw. The week and a half that it worked were great, but now Pentax is giving me problems about it being from overseas and as of now I'm stuck with a broken camera which cost 675 Deutch Marks (over $300 dollars.) Not sure I'd be quick to buy another Pentax due to lack of quality and customer service."
3,Camera Hunter,"Go to Pentax website for a picture of the Efina T. Also, it's range is 23-69mm (""equivalent"" to a 35mm's 29-87mm range). Considering a purchase...forced to rate product without ever using it."
3,Delayed Diagnosis Needs a Second Opinion,Delayed Reading is easy reading but somewhat not too original. Does not compare with other medical novels that I've read.
4,An enjoyable read,"I enjoyed this book. I liked the way that the story unfolded and only 'clicked"" on the perpetrator just over halfway through. Just the right amount of medical drama.I liked the characters although the love interest angle was perhaps a bit over the top, but did not distract from a good read.I have bought the second book in the series to give it a go."
5,I just could not put this down,I read this in days and it was a kindle page turner for me. I love a good medical mystery and this delivered.
5,A Great Mystery,"I loved this book! It will not be the last of Gwen Hunter's books that I will read. I am really looking forward to the next one. If you enjoy reading about strong, loyal heroines, this book is for you. I feel that Ms. Hunter is very talented in making her reader feel the emotins of the characters - and that is what draws you in. I couldn't put this book down until I knew who was responsible for Marisa's condition - I really wanted the villans to suffer. A great ending, a tantilizing hint of what the next book in this series might hold for Rhea and Mark, and great secondary characters that you want to learn more about make this book a wonderful summer read."
4,Get a better proofreader Ms. Hunter,Great medical mystery but very poor editing. I have never seen so many spelling and grammatical errors in a book. I still give it 4 stars though. Good story.
4,Love Medical Mysteries!,"A real page turner I couldn't put down. Was a little let down with the final pages, but still a great read."
5,DISCOVER THE CIVIL WAR!,"THE CIVIL WAR TRUST'S OFFICIAL GUIDE TO THE CIVIL WAR DISCOVERY TRAIL gives brief-but-accurate looks at over 400 sites in the United States, even those you thought weren't relevant to the Civil War. Time to discover your heritage! Grade: A+"
1,wrong product,"the product decribed is the old style of x1 with a clearly defined beam, the one they gave was the new style where there is blead off on the outer edges of the beam. this may be what you want, but it was not what i was looking for."
3,X1 not as bright as Gerber Infinity Ultra!!,"My X1 is not as bright as my old Gerber Infinity and certainly falls short of the light that my Gerber Firecracker puts out. Quality seems to be fine but not as good as my Firecracker. Some rave about the X1 and I have an X1 with green LED that is a good light, but my new X1 is just not that bright. Maybe it has an older LED in it. Save your money and buy an Infinity or Firecracker."
2,"Bright, Solid flashlight with serious design flaw","This light is bright and solid.It feels good in your hand.This is a flashlight that had lots of promise, but failed in the end to a design flaw.The light flickers as you walk or move the light around.This is caused by the battery rattling around inside of the casing.In fact, it even shuts itself off at times and you have to rattle it back on.The light is way too expensive for what you get.I would also look at the Streamlight Microstream and the Streamlight Pro flashlights.The Streamlight is brighter and I have found it to be much more reliable, when I have needed it."
3,Not the best.,To turn it on and off you have to turn the battery cap. It get loose and if you put it in your pocket often it turns on because the cap get turned. I would not buy another. Still provides good bright light in a small compact form.
4,emergency light,"I purchased it for my wife, something simple, small, single AA battery and brighter that you would expect form a light this small."
5,Awesome Book,"Orlando Luna and Ben Long are great writers. I've never known Ben Long, but I'm sure he's a great guy and knows his stuff. Ben has to be someone pretty experienced as well. Orlando Luna, is my dad. He's an awsome dad, and an awesome father. I'm hoping to write a book someday, not the same as his, but I hope its just as well written and helpful to others! Peace out home dawgzzzzzzz, and I am a photoshop MASTA so email me for samples of my work: jkidz@bellsouth.net"
2,Not a miracle pill.,"This product was strongly recommended to me by a health foods employee. He said it was their top seller, and after reading all the positive reviews, I decided to give it a try. I've had bad experiences with various iron supplements in the past (constipation), and so was nervous to try another one. Luckily, I experienced no side effects from this product, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. However, after 2 months of taking it (1 daily for first month, 2 daily for second month) and eating lots of iron-rich food, my iron levels actually LOWERED. So, this form of iron may work for some, but not for everyone."
5,Excellent way to get your iron,My teenage daughter needs extra iron. This is the first source that she has been able to take daily without some of the downside that comes with iron supplements.
5,Great for low iron folks!,"Great for people who have low iron. After having very low for years, I finally found a product that helps me fight iron deficiency!"
5,Shatner is The Best,"It's one of the best cop shows of all time. If you are a fan of William Shatner it is a must. I don't understand why the other seasons are not being released on dvd, but the first 2 seasons of TJ Hooker were the best.But be warned, you can't just watch one episode of this show.It is very catching."
3,I liked it,"I was a teenager when the show was on. I liked it. It had enough drama to hold my interest without being sex filled. For a lot of paarents, this is an important issue: just what can my kid watch that is decent. I remember this show qualifying."
5,"6 Year delay, WHAT THE HELL?","I loved this show back in the 80's. When i heard T.J. Hooker was coming DVD in the summer of '05 i hit the roof with joy. Finally after 20 odd years i was going to be abel to see the handsome William Shatner in uniform as the title character again, also sexy Adrian Zmed as Vince Romano and the ageless wonder Heather Locklear as Stacy Sheridan. When i recieved it something terrible happened the years started going by. I searched every concievable source for the rest of the releases, online, big name retail stores, every DVD and VHS provider/seller no success. I signed the online petition damanding the rest of the series on DVD! My question to the Studio is with now the 6th year since the initial release WHAT THE HELL? Get with the program and quit stalling the fans of this fine TV program and RELEASE THE REMAINING SEASONS!"
3,T.J. Hookrer - The Complete 1st & 2nd Seasons,"It was fun to watch this old police show. There were som corny moments, but over all the show held up pretty well. The Disc quality was not as good as Magnum PI, the menue tended to hang up. I had to return the first set. Amazon was great as usual. The replacement hung up a bit, but I was able to watch all the episodes. I don't think the lab where it was printed is as good as most of the Universal Studio DVDs. I still would probably buy Season 3. I would not buy it if they break up the seasons into voulmes 1 and two."
1,Sony does not deliver,"This item is inaccurately represented by Sony. The box set is suppose to contain the complete Seasons 1 and 2. However, when scrolling through the DVD's episode menu, at least two episodes are missing from each of the six DVD's. I've written Sony in an attempt for them to make good on the sale. If they do nothing about the missing episodes then I will contact the Attorney General.What has me really upset is that I cannot purchase future DVD's of T.J. Hooker or any other T.V series that Sony may produce on DVD. I like the old TV series, but will not purchase any until Sony corrects their ""mistake"" I'm sure I'm not the only one who has brought this to their attention. The DVD's should of been pulled and the missing episodes added."
1,Save Your Money to Buy Better Tongs!,"I thought that ice tongs were way down on my spending priorities, so I would just get the least expensive ones. How bad can ice tongs be? I was wrong. These don't do the job - just do not work worth a darn!! I will be now buying the good ones."
4,Kids mouse rocks!,I bought this for my three yr old who was always wanting to play on the computer. It is a great tool for kids who do not have the motor skills yet to click only the left side of the mouse. It is GREAT for small hands. Accept for having to download the program evey few months we love this product.
4,works fine,"There is no CD with the package. The driver needs to be downloaded from the internet. I googled the product name and found the driver. Once you figure out how to install the driver, which is simple, setup is quick. Setup allows you to disable the right button click, which is the most important feature. Althouhg the mouse works as claimed, my 3-year old took about two weeks to get skilled at using it. So do not be discouraged too quickly in the beginning, but your child needs some patience and desire to get accustomed to using it. Hence, I do not recommend it for a child under 3."
2,Works well,"the mechanical quality is a little low, being mass-produced junk from China. one thing they don't tell you, you MUST have the power adapter. i got this home, and set it up, and it didn't work. then reading through the instructions i found lots of references to the power supply. i ordered this and then it worked. Why they don't include this is beyond me, but they should."
4,Wireless Keypad,I was excited to finally get this keypad installed on my garage where I keep tools and storage. I did have some problems in the begging. I was about to send it back when it suddenly it started working correctly. Im chocking it up to operator error. Since I have gotten used to using this keypad it has been great.
2,Bad kepads,"I bought two of these along with an additional remote. One of the keypads wouldln't work at all. The other keypad worked intermittently for two years (rarely worked in cold weather). Now the second keypad quit completely. I tried new batteries, but no joy. The remotes work fine. No more skylink products for me - I'm going to have to replace it with something else."
1,Not compatable,"The smart button receiver does not work with some old garage door openers. My Overhead Door Co. opener has about 30VAC across the open / close switch terminals and promptly fried the Smart Button receiver when I connected it. There is not enough information available from SkyLink to know this until you connect it and smoke comes out of the Smart Button. Skylink sent a replacement under warranty, but I will need to return the Smart Button along with the keypad and remotes I bought. The product might be fine for other garage door openers, but you won't know from SkyLinks literature."
3,Call customer service before you buy this item,"Since there is no compatibility chart (that i can find) on this page, I chanced it and bought the unit assuming my garage door opener was a pre-2003 model... however when i got the unit, it went into detail about each brand of garage door opener it is compatible with, and it was only compatible with my brand up until 1997! This would have been useful to know. So i called customer service (i'm not allowed to give the number here, but i bet if you searched on skylink you'd find a number) and they told me about a universal adapter that will make it work with any garage door opener of any year... that was about $25, so everything is working now, and that's why i gave it three stars, but you should call skylink customer service before buying this unit, just to make sure it handles your garage door opener."
1,Which garage doors does this thing work on?,"My garage has two Overhead Door models, one newer and one older. This unit failed on both. Perhaps I should have followed the other reviewer's advice and looked elsewhere. Be cautious. I'm sure this model works on some model garage doors, but who knows which ones."
5,Works Well,"I purchased this product to use with a very old Craftsman door opener. I tried the Craftman model at twice the price and never could get it to synch up. This one worked as soon as it was connected.The first unit I recieved from the vendor would not operate with the default code. I e-mailed the vendor and she sent a replacement the very next day. Though I was originally disappointed the service of the vendor and the performance of the product made all the difference.I would recommend this for anyone looking for an inexpensive, performing solution."
2,A great idea but not glitch free,My reviews are to the point. I am very particular about items in the way they perform in the construction industry. I'm a Union Journeyman Wireman and could be considered close to a perfectionist and expect things to work as described. This item takes the variable means on which different garage door openers work by closing the contacts which go to the openers direct wired push button. Easy and fast installation as stated and nice looking design. Works 90% of the time but has about a 10% failure to operate no matter how many times you enter the code. For this reason I give it only a two star rating. Made overseas.
4,"Works Well, Easy to Use","The only ding I'll give this controller is simple - it doesn't light up when you open the cover. This means you have to randomly hit a button to turn the lights on in the dark, then start over with your code. Otherwise, it works great."
5,Tinkerbell Seat Cover,Excellent product. Fits well and easy to clean (we have a six year old boy). Very happy!
3,Keeps my Wii-mote clean and scratch-free,This skin keeps my Wii-mote clean and scratch free. There are nice openings for the front and back controls. My only complaint is that it's missing an opening in the back for the battery charger.
1,Misleading Photo of Skin,"I cannot rate the quality of the product because it never made it out of the packaging. The photo clearly shows two-toned skins, however, both my blue and pink were solid, light colors. Other reviews indicated the same issue and I should have heeded the warning. Amazon, you should ship what you show! I shall be returning the items and making the purchase else where."
1,Not a good choice,We bought two of these skins for our wii remotes. They are terrible. They need to be pulled up and down every time batteries need replacing. Within two months the skins had ripped up the sides. Don't waste your money.
3,"Nice, but a pain to replace batteries","This skin looks very nice on the Wiimote. It fits very snugly, and gives the Wiimote a nice feel. There are a few issues with it though. First off, if you are like me(meaning you play alot) then you will find that replacing the batteries is not that easy because you have to remove the skin to access the battery compartment. Putting the skin on once was not an issue, but removing and putting the skin back on once a week begins to get old, and I feel that eventually the skin will get stretched out and not fit well after a while. The other issue is that the strap that comes with it is the old style(read: easy to break) cord. So you will not want to use the strap that comes with it."
3,NOT A GAME,"I am not sure why the review asked me how much fun this game is, but its not. If you buy the rechargeable Wii station (which I highly recommend) you can't use skins because they don't fit in the dock."
1,Not the item pictured,"I ordered three of these Wii Remote Control Skins (black, blue, and pink) from Amazon, and none of them were the two-toned colored ones pictured on Amazon's website. My pink one is super light pink (all one color), the blue is light, baby blue (all one color), and the black is just black. Friends of mine have the two-toned ones that are pictured, so that's what I thought I was getting. Shame on you, Amazon, for misrepresenting the items."
3,"Love the button, hate the cord","I searched for the one button mac mouse and found only a couple left. I have the ADB version of this Macally mouse and love it. That was for my G3. Now I have a new mac mini and I had to get a USB mouse. The mouse itself is just what I wanted. The problem is the cord. When you make a cord this thick and heavy, all you do is create a longing for wireless. Plus the way these manufacturors bundle up the cord... it's like an accordian. It'll never streighten out. To bad.Oh, and about the previous review. This is not an optical mouse. It has a ball."
5,RCA CRF910,"It hooks up a new cheap DVD purchased for Xmax 2006 with a Direct TV set top box to an RCA TV bought in 1984, now in our bedroom. It just works."
1,Did not work,Plugged it in and the product did not work. Went to Walmart & found something cheaper and that did work.Go to Walmart & save the cash.
2,RCA quality strikes again.,"Yep, I thought $30 was a pretty good price. I thought $25.99 on sale was better, so I bought it. Good looking, versatile, easy to use. We really liked it (frankly, we never thought about it again) for the 10 *** Months *** that it lasted. Yes, correct, months. But what can you do, there aren't a whole lot to choose from. Found a replacement for $20. Hooked it with no prob, same as before. It worked great for 4 hours and 35 minutes. Then it turned off, never to function again. Good luck finding one that works for a while."
1,I didn't listen,"RCA CRF910 Auto Switching RF Modulator with Gold - Plated Connectors, Coaxial and S-Video InputOther reviews said this thing had a habit of not working.. They were right. This was dead right out of the box. Thinking it was a good deal I've ordered two more and will soon see if there is a pattern. But my first experience was NOT GOOD. Just like others reported."
3,John Wayne - An American Icon,"While I enjoy most anything at all that is associated with ""The Duke,"" I was a bit disappointed with this video. I found myself fast-forwarding through much of it. It was not what I thought it was going to be. If you are looking for a biography video on John Wayne..... keep shopping. This is not it! It has some redeeming qualities, I suppose, but I found it mostly boring. And the movies that are included were not to my tastes. Sorry folks, I can't really recommend this one."
5,Solid All Purpose Camera,Canon's product quality and customer service led me to buy the camera and it has not disappointed. It has all the picture quality and features I could need for everyday use. I find I use the video feature of the camera as much as taking still pictures. It's easy to bounce back and forth and the camera lets you easily adjust resolution for e-mailing video clips and pictures to friends and family.
3,What is wrong with movies?,"Has anyone else had this problem?.....I have an A620 and just got the A630. When taking movies with the new A630, there are a lot more rolling lines and ""screen"" effect than is with the A620, especially in the edges of objects.This is in the 640 x 480 mode at 30 fps. (most popular shooting mode)The movie quality should be at least as good in the A630 as it was in the A620, rather than objects looking like they are moving around and ""rolling"" the peppermint twist. Otherwise, I would have given this camera 5 stars. This is a lot less of a problem in my A620."
5,great camera for the price,"pros: great picture quality, good battery life, accessories come cheap, and good variety of features and options.cons: pictures go grainy with noise at high iso settings, lack of picture stabilizer.great for beginners and those who want a great camera without paying the big bucks for the xlr cameras."
3,Great camera except for flash problems,"We have owned this camera for just under two years. It has lots of powerful features that we've enjoyed using, especially things like timed exposures. We have taken a lot of great pictures with it. However, recently the flash has intermittently stopped working. When trying to take a picture, the symbol for the flash would blink on and off on the screen, and it refused to take the picture unless we turned the flash off. The manual says nothing about what the blinking flash symbol means. At present, the flash works sometimes, but it is no longer synchronized with the shutter. Is this an electronic problem rather than a mechanical problem? Anyway, it sets the shutter speed, etc., based on the presence of the flash, but the flash is early - ""flash . . click"". So no pictures come out right. Time to get another camera."
3,canon powershot A630,"I have been very pleased with the pictures I've taken with this camera as far as outdoor still-life (flowers, ...). However, in low-light, it is very difficult to get a good shot. With flash, the color is off, with no flash, it is extremely blurry every time. But, takes pretty decent video and seems to hold battery charge pretty well."
3,You'll want to order an upgraded memory card,"It wasn't clear to me from the product description how inadequate the memory card included with the camera would be. It came with a 16M card that was full after I shot a half-dozen still images. You'll want to order an upgraded card (I went with a 1G SanDisk card) at the same time that you order the camera, otherwise you won't be able to do much with it. Otherwise I've been pretty happy with the camera, although I'm still playing around with different settings, lighting, etc."
3,"Good, but not what I expected","I bought this camera expecting great things. I do like it but there are a couple things I feel I should mention. When using the zoom, especially to get close pictures of small objects, you must hold the camera exceptionally still or the picture turns out blurred. I didn't think that would be a problem since I am used to using non digital cameras with telephoto lenses. I was wrong. Apparently this camera requires a tripod for I have yet to get a good picture when using a great deal of zoom. The other thing I felt I should mention is if you are shooting a picture through a window the color turns out faded and drab even if there is no reflection. Like I said I do like this camera, but it is not the wonder I expected."
4,Nice camera,"This is a nice camera but I would have never bought it had I not dropped my Powershot A80 on the driveway. This new camera does take nice pictures but I think the ""Auto"" setting is not nearly as good as what my A80 had. When I don't feel like using the manual settings I more often get disappointed with the picture. Mainly they look washed out and drab. The A80 did a much better job when you want to be lazy.I will say I have some very nice pictures with this camera when using the manual modes (and some with ""Auto""). The video is nice and looks pretty good when hooked up to a standard CRT TV. I picked this camera because the viewfinder folds open and swivels around. This is nice when holding the camera over my head and adjust the viewfinder so I can still see my target."
3,manual mode not intuitive,"I like just about everything about this camera except the manual mode. Ifyou never use manual, then you'll LOVE this camera but since I'm a veteranshooter, I find it lacking. It's not intuitive and takes getting used to.Otherwise, a great camera"
5,Canon is a great camera at a great price,"Upgraded from Canon A70 and have no complaints. Has lots of picture taking modes such as kids, snow, fireworks etc....Love the big, moveable LCD screen. Even takes great movies. Love my Canon A630!!"
4,Outstanding,"Love this camera. Best we have ever owned, except for low light performance. It does hunt a little to focus in low light, sometimes not being able to focus automatically (Our Sony was amazing in low light, but not as good overall)"
5,Great camera,"I wanted this for a long time. It's a great camera with lots of features. The macro lense is WONDERFUL as is the zoom. It's easy to use and takes aa battery's to operate. I kind of wish it took a rechargable ion battery, but whatever. I recommend it for sure."
3,"Nice shots, BUT red eye reduction not good","I have had this camera for several months (my first digital). Overall, the clarity and color of the shots are great. My big complaint is that most of the time the red eye reduction doesn't work, so I waste countless hours with a photo software taking the red eye out. The troubleshooting portion of the manual states that the subject should be looking directly at the red eye lamp. That's not very easy when taking pictures of children. It also recommended brighter lighting which many times a person has no control over, especially if the picture is taken outside at dusk. I had a Ricoh film camera that I loved and the red eye reduction worked everytime. However, that red eye reduction was a flash as bright as the flash itself (rather than a dull lamp) so I used to tell people to wait for the 2nd flash before getting out of the pose. Maybe Canon should improve the technology for its red eye reduction."
5,Good service and product,Quick serices and good product. Will give very hig recommendation ot the people are interesting to.
4,Superior Buy When On Sale!,"Bought this camera after seeing a good review and I have not been disappointed.The camera takes some good pix even when on automatic settings. I've found the swivel screen to be a huge plus and I use it all the time. I'm pretty tech savy, but think most folks can figure out the advanced features on this camera.And to top it off, the batteries last ten times longer in this camera than my old Fuji.Its not the smallest camera out there, but if you don't need to slip it in your pocket, this one's a winner."
2,Not working well,The camera seemed ok till it broke. The button that adjusts the zoom doesn't function nor does the button you press for photos. We've taken good care of it so we're surprised it doesn't work. We're not sure what to do now. Not sure if the warranty will cover.
5,Powerful Power Shot,"Just got this camera yesterday after doing extensive research and comparisons with other brands etc. Though it does not have the image stabilizer touted by some of the other canons, many of the shooting modes offer this option which I think is pretty cool. I am still getting to know the camera but so far its been great and has taken some awesome photos. I think for the price its definitely a great value."
3,This camera will not run with rechargable batteries!,"I just bought this camera and was extremely dissappointed to find out that it will only run using alkaline batteries. Fully charged NIMH batteries will cause it to start extending the lens and then shut down with it half way out. This is completely unacceptable. Because of its high 'dead' battery voltage, you aren't able to fully use alkalines either. They are still quite useable in other things when this camera says they are dead. Besides this problem though, this camera has a lot of nice features. I am happy with everything else. Just the same, I wouldn't have bought this camera if I had realized how bad its power problems are."
4,Best Camera for the Price Let Me Tell You Why!!!!,"This is a great camera because of the quality, it's a Canon, takes clear pictures, and it's easy to use. I bought the case so I just slip it on my belt and have a 2.0MP card so I can take like 900 photos or videos. The size and it has no stabilizer are it's pit falls. You can't put the camera in your pocket or purse and if you have a problem shaking, the photo may come out fuzzy, I haven't experienced it yet. It's digital so you can always review the photos when taken. I found the night photos did not come out very clear, I experienced that with my two other digital cameras also.I went to Hawaii with it, best move I ever made- B++++ overall, A+++ Quality and Price."
3,easy to use / good pictures,"this thing is easy to use takes good pictures , uses easily obtainable AA batteries. I would give it 5 stars easily except the date /Time stamp will not work"
2,Canon PS A630 Poor indoor Quality Pictures,"I own a Canon G2 4MP camera that takes fantastic pictures indoors and outdoors. It takes fantastic indoor picture without a flash, which at times is a plus because you do not lose anything in the background like you do when you use a flash.I just became a Grandmother and wanted a camera that also takes good video. So I ordered the A630 and I am very disappointed with the quality of the indoor pictures. It takes a fantastic video at the high setting and takes great outdoor pictures. But is poor with indoor pics, very grainy. I tried all different settings to try and see what I am doing wrong, does not matter the indoor pics just stink.I am returning the camera and looking for a better indoor picture quality with the 640 video settings."
4,Great Camera ! Good for videos too,"I've been owning this camera for the past 6 months. It is so easy to handle. I am not an expert photographer - the ""auto"" mode works well for me. This camera can be used to take good videos too. The quality of the videos taken are comparable to the ones taken by Sony DCR-HC48 camcorder. Best suited for indoor day time videos. The only drawback is the need for 4 AA batteries which makes the camera too heavy to carry. If you are used to compact models from Canon, you would find it a bit difficult to adjust to this. However, you can compromise for the nice LCD display, 8 Mega pixels photos and the quality videos.I am a loyal Canon customer and the A630 hasn't disappointed me."
2,Not the best--There are better ones,"I bought this camera thinking that it would be an upgrade to a 4 y/o Olympus that I had--I was wrong!This model had some very nice features and was easy to learn, but it lacks one important capability and that's (IS) Image Stabilization otherwise known as the ability to adapt for camera shake when taking a picture. I was disappointed by how many blurry images I was getting so much so that I returned it.If you want a compact camera such as this, I'd strongly suggest seeking one of the other Canon models that offers the (IS) feature."
4,Macro,I bought this unit basically interested in macrophotography. Up to now -over 1 week - it has fully fulfilled my expectations. It is a very good camera for its value range.
1,Lens Errors Still a Problem,"This is the second Power Shot camera I've owned I've had the lens get stuck on in less than 4 years, but of course after the warranty ran out. I kept it in a case and was very careful with it, but the lens got stuck anyway. The next camera I buy will probably NOT be a Canon, and I've only owned Canons up to this point."
3,Just too bulky for me,"This camera is great for someone that doesn't mind bulk. It has a lot of great functions and features and the pictures a pretty clear. It was just too big for me, I had to return it."
5,Good experience,"Received the product within the scheduled time, box packed. The same model that I was expecting.I will deal with this seller in future."
2,It may die after two years of use,I owned a Canon PowerShot A610 and it turned a black screen on me after two years of use. Other buyers also had the same problem with A610. It may happen to A630 too. You are probably happy too early. It is not a good value because the A610 is really a disposable camera disguised as a good value buy. This can be true for A630 again.
4,Canon PowerShot A630 8MP Digital Camera,I really like the camera but find some of the buttons to be awkwardly placed in that I either hit them while trying to find others or I cannot hold two buttons at the same time such as when trying to take wide angle shots.
5,Good product! Good service!,"I hoped to get the product ordered in the website amazon on time, in fact, I got it earlier. Good product, good service, which are so important, I am going to order other products from this website."
4,mr.,i like this camera because it is easy to use. you don't have to be an expert to use it. everything is there for you. just press the button and that's it.
4,Great Camera,The camera performs as claimed. I have an older model which is basically the same camera except for the 4x zoom and 8 megapizel. You cannot go wrong with a Canon.
2,"Bad photos in low lite, week auto focous","The camera has some good manual functions, but it lacks a good sensor for low lite photos. It has a good macro, but it works only with manual focus that works very slowly. the lcd is small with a very low resolution and brightness.The configuration of the camera is good, but it needs new sensor, new auto focus sistem and a new lcd."
2,Picture quality in midimum light,"I bought this camera after good review from my friend for previous version which was 5 MP. This camera is more in weight and the biggest problem is picture quality when light is midium or low. It did not function well at all while we were taking picures in banquest hall with more yellow light as well as same problem when we took pictures in basement with regular light. The light in banquest hall and basement was really good enough for taking pictures as other cannon camera with 5MP did really good job where as this A630 completely failed to show good results. each pictures was yellow, I try to take it using night shot, that was even worst as there was alreay enought light. I think this camera is getting confused on auto flash.I am going to probably going to garbage this camera, it is completely waste of my $."
5,Canon Camara works amazingly.,"I love the camara. It works really well.My only issue, is that the battery wears out quickly. Other than that, everything's great."
4,I'd recommend this one,"I had the A540, I upgraded to this one. The A540 is a great camera, the A630 is the same - except it is slightly larger and has a swivel screen. The swivel screen comes in handy not only for reaching above to take a shot, but also for taking pictures and video of kids that like to watch themselves. The A630 also takes 4 AA batteries. The video quality is great for a digital camera. On the ""standard"" setting it is easy to make good movies to put on DVD."
5,Superb camera,I am way more than satisfied with this camera. It is so easy to use and the pictures are perfect.
5,Takes beautiful photos,"I am not a professional photographer but I think this camera takes some of the best photos I have seen in a while. If you know how to read the display and understand which settings you need for the photo you are taking, then there is no way you could not end up with a beautiful result. The zoom on this camera is great, and I love the 360 monitor!"
4,very happy customer,"I had a canon A540 before this and wanted to upgrade to get closer photos and clearer pictures. So far, I have not been disappointed that much. I have had it over a month and have taken many different kinds of photos. Very close up of singular flowers came out fantastic. Caught some quick action shots clearly...was great. Realistic color is improved and I am enjoying this part. Scenery pictures come out great. Did video of a major thunderstorm that brought a tornado to my neighbors. The close-up of falling hail didn't stay clear as I zoomed in. The close-up photos of hail stones were great!!, though. Overall, I am enjoying the camera. A little bit bigger than my old one, but the fun I am having overules! My dad has the next level up, so I knew what I was getting. It is very similar to his. It is not perfect, but I am enjoying the improvements, and the quick response when you press the button is just worth it all!!!"
5,Very Good Digital Camera,This is my second Canon Digital Camera because I used to have powershot 95 but my brother like it and I gave it to him as gift.So I did a lots of research again on the net and I could not find a better camera then this one.
5,canon powershot A630 digital camera,This is a great overall camera. I like the swivel screen a lot. This feature allows you to take pictures of yourself or of objects in different angles and still be able to see what you are photographing. The pictures are very clear. The auto mode seems to work better for the most part than choosing a specific setting option. The camera is very versitile and easy to use. A great camera for the affordable price.
4,Worth the money,"Bought this in a haste as I as planning an trip to an outdoor location and did not have a camera. Result: Very much satisfied...Pros and Cons are below:+ves: Performs its prmiary function very well that is takes amazingly clear picures, the rotating LCD screen adds a lot of flexibility and helps us take pics in any position.-ves: Requires 4 AA batteries and is hence a bit bulky, also batteries are sucked out very quickly (keep a spare set in case the charger is not handy) I am also not very sure of its capability when the light is not good, maybe a bit of fine tune is needed from my side...Over all worth the money, and I cannot complain given the amount I paid for it..."
5,Nice buy,"The Canon PowerShot A630 is a light, fast and dependable camera. My first Canon was the A75, 3.2 mp; this one shoots faster, saves battery power and has enough programs that allows a snapshot and a more elaborate, almost manual settings photo. It deals beautifully with difficult lighting and the photos are sharp with very nice colors. I'm an amateur and use for leisure photos. It is, as much as I looked at the other cameras, a wonderful value for the money spent. I'm happy with it"
5,Outstanding value,"Good image definition, reasonable 4x optical zoom, filming capability, flexible power source, established brand.This is a camera for amateur photographers that nonetheless offers interesting shooting possibilities. You can use regular batteries in it or buy the rechargeable battery pack for a few more bucks. My advice is that you should buy the battery pack and take regular batteries with you when traveling to far, isolated places where electricity is not available. And for those like me who do not like to use digital zooming, the 8-megapixel definition allows you to extend the power of the 4x optical zoom as it offers great picture cropping possibilities without lessening the quality of 5x7 inch prints."
2,Redeye,"I replaced my Canon A95 with the A630, and I have the worst case of redeye I have ever seen in a camera. The sharpness of the pictures is no different from the A95 nor is the quality of the images any better. I may go back to my A95."
4,Great pictures - easy to use,"This camera is small and relatively lightweight. It takes great pictures even when the cameraman is not really ""into"" photography. Just point and shoot. Speed between pictures is good and the camera is easy to use. Glad we bought it."
5,EXCELLENT,"I bought this as an audio cassette and listened to it in the 80's and 90's! I loved it and still love it to this day! I played it so much to going to sleep, to studying to it at college, to cleaning my place, etc. that I wore down one side and was soooo bummed that I tried to preserve it as much as possible by not playing it! When I found that I could order it as a CD and got it...I was happy...it was incredible! My niece used it for part of her wedding this past April (2011)! Am playing it right now as I am typing out this review! For those who love this piece and are not overkilled by it...the piece starts off (and ends) with crashing oceans waves and seabirds in the constant background! You gotta have it! Enjoy!"
3,"Not unpleasant, a bit wierd -- not a keeper.","I feel compelled to write because of all the relentless positive 5-star reviews for this book. I have three daughters all 10 and under. None of them pick this book to have read to them at night. The illustrations are fine. The cat and the fish and the whole ""faith"" issue is a bit creepy. Not a keeper for us."
2,Faith in a fish,"The story starts out nicely with the seasons changing on an island but then out of nowhere a scarey kitten comes on a boat and then calls himself an island and has a talk with a fish about faith!""What's that?"" said the cat-""Faith.""""To believe what I tell you about what you don't know,"" said the fish.Then the kitten leaves and the book returns to the changing of the seasons on the island. If the creepy part with the kitten (the 5 pages of nonsense) was not in the book this would be a very nice book."
3,The Little Island,"I bought this book because my First grader's class is studying Caldecott winning books and it was suggested that each child donate a new or used book from home if they could. I selected this one from the huge list, and then found that 2 other students had donated it already. So, we kept it and chose another one. This is good, but not my favorite Caldecott book."
3,Beautiful Illustrations.....but hard to keep a 4 1/2 year old's interest,"This story is very cute and ""zen like"". I liked it personally as an adult and as a mom who tries to teach the harmonious aspect of nature. However there is some strange situations (like a kitty coming to the island and capturing a fish briefly only to hear the story of the island and let him go) and then the kitty is gone and you really don't know whats happened.The book is a little ""ADD"" that way and 4 1/2 year olds like my daughter are very keen on a clear cut story...this book had her asking lots of questions and didn't interest her too much. It is certainly not one she picks out for me to read. It's a cute story but a hard concept for a young child to grasp"
5,Lovely book!,What a wonderful book!!! Reminds me of the old fashioned books I had growing up. Beautiful pictures and wonderful story. I love reading this book!!!!
5,son loves it,"son currently 4 loves this book it has become one of his favorites. he started making up words to it while we were driving home the day i received it at the office. it does talk about having faith to believe things you cant know. eg cat can't go under water to see that the island is also part of the land, but the fish tells him to have faith in his word. it is something along those lines."
3,Island Review,The Little Island is a book k about a little island and what happens to it over the course of a small amount of time. Some people and their cat sail to this island to have a picnic and and the cat is very curious about the island. This book teaches sometimes things are better left alone like the island is nicer before the cat comes. It is good for a 4-6 year old child with a lot of colorful pictures for the child ton look at.
1,I think we need more info,"I think we need to know if this item can be use in other countries, does it have duo voltage, I just think that we need to know if this is a 110/240 volt adaptor or no. Thank you!"
4,"crisp, clear images","This camera has excellent ability to capture fine details. I was ableto stand at the base of a cathedral, aim the camera up, and take apicture of the architectural details at the very top of the cathedral- that's probably some five stories up. .... The drawbacks were that this camera was quite heavy, andthe image from the eyepiece was always blurry for some odd reason."
1,Do not order this from Amazon!!,"I ordered these as a Christmas gift, and although they were ordered before the ""Holiday guaranteed shipping deadline"", they still arrived a few days after Christmas. Also, when they did arrive, they were packed so poorly in the box that one of the crocks was cracked in half. I ended up finding the same exact crocks at a local department store for a lower cost. As much as I've loved the books, electronics, DVD's, etc, that I order from Amazon, I will never order these knowing that the packaging will not get it here in one piece. It was a complete disappointment."
3,One broken handle.........,I agree with the other reviewers; nice set but one of the handles was broken. I didn't notify Amazon tho because I didn't want to bother returning them.
1,Not oven safe!,"Why make a non-oven-safe onion soup crock? French onion soup is a classic dish with a classic prep, i.e. the cheese gets browned in the broiler. Booo!FYI- ordered two sets, i.e. eight bowls. One handle was broken."
1,Poor Materials Used to Make Bowls,"One of the bowls arrived without a handle. It had broken off, but was not in the box. I put the bowls in the dishwasher. After they were washed, half of them were chipped around the top. I had to throw them out. The substance used to manufacturer these bowls was substandard. I was very disappointed. I will never order ""Sango"" anything."
2,"Great Bowls, bad packaging","I ordered 2 sets of these bowls. They were shipped from Amazon in a large box with no packing material. Each set was in its original box, but no packing there either. Out of the 8 shipped, 6 survived. No help from Amazon. Very dissapointing.The bowls themselves are very nice. If you find them locally you will be happy with them."
1,Oops!,"I bought this as a Christmas present for someone. When they opened it, every single one of the bowls had the handle broken off. One of the bowls itself, was broken.The person tried to fix them. By the time I found out they were broken it was past the return date.I was very disappointed in the packing and shipping."
4,Great for French Onion Soup,Nicely made and great for oven baked French Onion Soup. Great with the handle so you can serve all types of soups or stews
1,Handle Design Flaw,"We received a set of 6 as a gift and we truly loved them at first. After a few uses, we noticed that one of the handles was broken off of the bowl as we removed it from the dishwasher. Since then, another handle has broken off in the exact same spot on the handle as the first one. Needless to say, we are down 2 bowls and will not buy this set as a future replacement. They are available at reasonable prices all over the net but simply aren't worth it at any price."
2,Great product but broken during shipping.,"These soup bowls are great. The packing, however, is not good. I ordered two boxes of four. One box arrived completely intact. All four bowls in the other box were broken - handles broke off.Amazon customer service (by phone) was very helpful. I don't have to ship the broken ones back, and they're sending me a new (hopefully intact!) box of four at no charge."
2,All Broken,"I agree with everyone else below.They are indeed beautiful bowls but, in my first shipment, 2 of the bowls were broken. So I ordered a replacement and all four were broken.I wouldn't bother ordering them through Amazon, they are obviously horribly packaged."
2,bad handles,"I love the size and shape of the bowls, but all of the handles have broken off at this point and not from dropping."
2,Breaks very easily,The first shipment was in pieces. Returned and it was reshipped. The replacement order had a handle broken. I've given up and will try super glue.VERY fragile.
2,Woefully inadequate packing on this item,"I received a set of these bowls today and they seem to be lovely and just what I was looking for as I have had handled bowls in the past and they are just great for hot soups and chili. The packaging both inside the box containing the bowls and in between this box and the shipping box is next to nil. Only cardboard between the bowls (hence the broken handles on two of my bowls and a few nearly deflated air baloon packets between this box and the shipping box.This is not at all my experience with Amazon in the past and am somewhat disappointed - I am however ordering a replacement in the hopes that I will receive a complete and unbroken set since they do seem to be very nice - if broken this time, will rethink ordering from Amazon on things such as this in the future."
2,"Great in Theory, Not so much practically","I really wanted to like these bowls. They're really cute and go with my dinnerware perfectly...However the handle is too narrow and doesn't really provide a great place to hold the bowls. You have to put them on a plate if you're going to eat anywhere other than the dinner table and even when I wash them and carry them to the table empty, I feel like I'm going to break the handle off at any moment. A really cute soup bowl, just needs a bigger handle."
3,Nice but fragile,"Nice items, easy to cook onion soup in oven.But be carefull, the handle is fragile!"
3,"Love the bowls, buyer BEWARE of shipping","I had these bowls on my wishlist last year and my mother ordered them for me just before Christmas 2007. Unfortunately, as everyone has noted, they are poorly packed. One arrived broken and the issue was never resolved.The bowls are fabulous though, assuming they survive shipping :-)"
4,tasty soup from black bowls,"The bowls arrived as promised, on time and in new condition. Although the soup was great, it takes a lot of time and effort to produce french onion soup so I may not have it as often as I once thought."
4,Great soup bowls,"I ordered these for a Christmas basket. I liked them so much I ordered another four for myself. They are a great size, well shaped and pretty to boot."
3,French Onion Soup bowls,"A very attractive piece, but poorly designed. The handles are much too delicate for the bowl itself. Hence we have had three shipments of the same, due to handles being broken off upon arrival."
5,Emotional Rollercoaster,"The first time I read this book was on an airplane on my way back to college from home. I could not help but cry the entire time I read this book. I had lost a pet when I was young and not fully aware of all that comes with death, but just the thought of losing my dog or cat made tears come falling down my face. It also helped me to understand, in that unfortunate case, how to deal with my pet dying and that there are many people who feel the same way about their pets as I do. I loved the book and recommend it to anyone who loves pets and has pets of their own."
2,"A hotchpotch, curate's egg, or simply waffle?","I have mixed feelings about this book. Firstly, I hold it in some affection, because I read it when researching my first novel, The Forgotten Legion. However, while it was interesting to read about someone who has visited the area where Roman legionaries might, just might, have ended up after the battle of Carrhae in 53 BC, the book is extremely thin on archaeological or historical evidence.So what we end up with is an account of the author's trips to western China, his difficulties with officialdom, his financial worries, his personal relationships, and some funny accounts of his socialising with the Chinese who took him in and befriended him. Hmmm. Not what I was looking for, or how the book is marketed.It aims high, but rather falls flat on its face thanks to lack of substance. A real shame.Ben Kane."
3,"Odd travelogue, vague history","Looked for years to find an affordable copy of this book after being intrigued by the basic storyline.Turns out that it's rather marginal as a description of the scientific undertaking of verifying the myth of roman soldiers in gansu.The author makes a valiant effort at describing the events surrounding tiananmen square from his perspective in western china, although suffers in comparison to more professional authors who described the events from the center of the action.The biggest surprise, though, is how interesting the personal story of this author is - I wish he had spent more time explaining the details. In his mid-40's, recently divorced, not very well travelled, and with absolutely no money - he suddenly gets an itch to go do something wacky in China. The project becomes a symbol for his mental recovery - which has a happy ending when he marries his new sweetheart (in China).Would be very curious to know what has become of them...."
3,Great product if it doesn't malfunction,"I love this headlamp, but as with one other reveiwer, after a few months of flawless use, it started shutting off on me in the middle of active use. This can be quite dangerous depending on what you are using it for. At the very least it is aggrivating. It is usually difficult to get it to come back on without adjusting the batteries in various ways. I like the headlamp itself so much that I have continued to use it even with this large fault, but I am becoming less tolerant and am likely to purchase a new head lamp soon, but will not buy this one again unless this issue is resolved with the product."
4,Nice little light,"I was a little hesitant to buy this because I didn't really know what I was getting from the picture. It looked large and I couldn't figure out what the thing on the back was. But for $25 (gold box deal) I thought what the heck, I needed a light for wagon walks with my family and for little jobs around the house. This thing is quite small (fits inside the palm of my closed hand, the thing on the back pulls out to strap on to your head, or arm, or stationary object. The LEDs leave spots in my eyes when I look at them, but aren't as bright as I thought they would be in the dark open air. Bright enough to take a walk or to plug in an extension cord outside, but not enough power to use in a search party (I don't do that sort of thing, but if I did) or across a meadow looking for your dog. I think it's a great little light though. Wouldn't buy again unless it was on sale because you can always find something like this for under $40 if you shop around."
3,defect?,"When it works, it works pretty good.You can select various modes by the # times pressed: (1) high, (2) medium, (3) low, & (4) strobe.Unfortunately, the push on/off doesn't seem to always register. Not sure if it's a design defect, or just a defective unit. Once in a while it stays on, and you have to remove batteries to turn off. And sometimes it won't turn on, and you have to wait a while, almost as if it has to reset itself. ???Because of it's occasional tempermental nature, I deduct a couple stars (assuming it's not a design defect). If not for that, it would receive a perfect score :)Wonder if anyone else has this problem ?NOTE: if it is a design defect, I'd deduct more."
5,A great little light!,I've owned a Zipka for the past 4 years and it's been great! A real help on camping trips and for those times when I need to work on something in the dark and have my hands free. All the wear and tear is starting to show so I thought I would buy another and retire my original to the glove compartment of my car for emergencies....Saw the new Zipka and thought I would give it a shot... While time will tell if it has the long term performance of my original I have to say it's got several features that are pretty nice over the original.... The fourth LED produces a markedly greater light output and is a welcome addition and the greatest improvement in an already great design... The switch now gives you the ability to select 3 levels of brightness (nice!) and a blinking option. The blinking selection is useless for me and annoying but is the only thing about the new design that doesn't add value for me...
5,excellent,I loved this book. It's both inspirational and educational and the speeches are chosen with great care. Five stars all the way
3,Good pronunciation guide?,"While this book DOES contain a guide to pronunciation both at the beginning of the book and at the detailed word level, the pronunciation details themselves are very disappointing. The distinction of Welsh rising and falling diphthongs is not made (e.g., ""OO-ee"" versus ""wEE"" for WY), and long and short vowel distinction is not made (e.g., a long E is transliterated exactly like a short E). Additionally, the marking of syllabic stress is not clear and in some cases incorrect. If you are a serious student of Welsh, then you'll need to look elsewhere; if you're a tourist or a casual language learner, then this dictionary should suffice your needs. There isn't much else out there!Otherwise as a dictionary, this is adequate."
3,"Ok, but the material is a little cheap",The shoes are ok for the price. The material looks a little cheap but they are comfortable. The sizing. You should get your street size. I am an 8.5 and I ordered 9 because of the reviews. They are a little bit big. :(
1,Disappointed,"Mitch Miller is known for ""follow the bouncing ball"". I was looking for a video to share with a group of seniors so they could sing along with the bouncing ball and see the words. This video did not have that. It was just a group singing."
5,Nice little Set.,"Great basic spade bit set in a sturdy protective case. They seem to be a bit quicker at drilling then average spades. Good Set, Get It. Makes for a good Christmas gift also."
1,No benefit of owning this title.,The title seems different than what the content should be. Has a fancy looking cover but lagging in content. The example programs found in this book are not very good at all. This book was hard to read and provided little use to me. Their is no approach to learning how to build the applications in this book - eveything is slapped together by topic and it jumps around to much to follow along. The book attemps to teach Visual Basic Database Programming and Visual Basic Game Programming but never seems to be on cue. I would rather buy a book on each type of programming seperatly (ex. Visual Basic Game Programming or Visual Basic Database Programming). I would not run out and try to launch a career after reading this book.
1,Shakespeare Out of Sync,"The customer reviews on the Amazon site should have warned me: This is a technically unacceptable DVD. I borrowed the VHS version from a friend and it is superior in every way. On the DVD, the visuals are dark and smeared---plus, ruinously, the soundtrack is always completely out of sync with the film. The performance itself is a telecast from the 1960s featuring a number of major British Shakespeareans plus a few ""special guests"" (Benny Hill and Tony Tanner). It is mostly complete, though there are some odd cuts (Puck's final speech, for example). On the VHS version you can see and hear it properly and enjoy the production values and acting nuances. On DVD, it is a pain, start to finish."
4,Steve Harvey is a man about his feelings,"I really like Steve Harvey because he is a man that comes out how he feels about issues. He does not hold back , he is in a class by himself that no other comedy presentator can steal."
5,quick shipment,The seller shipped to me in less than 3 days and i am all the way in the Germany great job.
4,Funny and surprising,"I got a chance to see this DVD on a trip to New York this summer. Watching it on the bus ride I decided right then and there that when I got home I would purchase this. It take's a lot of courage to change your style that so many are use to. Yes, I liked the foul mouthed Steve, but I also love the clean mouthed Steve. I think the DVD is worth purchasing just to see him introduce GOD if given the chance...and when HE come's I pray HE allow's Steve Harvey to introduce HIM."
4,SHOW THE LOVE!!!!!!,"Steve Harvey is One of my all time Favorite Comedians ever. I dig his overall Versatility&Presentation. he went from different topics&keep things cool. I dig his humor no matter if he curses or not. Steve is the truth,always Props to the Soul Brother. His Radio Show is tight. SHOW THE LOVE!!!!!"
4,"Its ok, but read the title","Its a good video to watch with teen family, not for everyone though. If your easily affended dont watch. Im a youth pastor, and i watched this with my teens, they liked it, but some of their parents might not have. Its very modern/culture current. He does some stuff about the church that I laughed at but some christians might not think so funny. Therefore, if your no too uptight, its a good clean video with an ending where Steve pretends to deliver the announcement of the King of Kings and ITS POWERFUL!"
5,Great Christian Laughs,"Steve was great! No bad words, or anything! Steve showed how we can still have fun and laugh as Christians."
4,I like Steve....,Steve Harvey did his thing and I appreciate the more family friendly approach with no cursing. Some comedians think you can't be funny with cussin' like sailors. I appreciate this work - Steve did his thing.
5,dont trip,Watching steve harvey trying not to swear is worth buying this dvd alone.I would definately recommend this to anybody and everybody
4,Side-splittingly funny!,"It has been a long time since I've laughed so hard I cried, but watching Steve Harvey in front of the huge MegaFest crowd, I had many belly laughs. He really does have a ""third"" eye, and his memories and insights ring so true. Surprising to me, the finale ""What if..."" introduction took my breath away!"
2,Steve's Introduction!!,"I received the DVD as promised. I only recommend this DVD because of the very last segment- Steve Harvey's introduction of the Coming King of Kings! Other than that it was NOT entertaining at all. Although he did not cuss, but his humor was sometimes cruel and attacking."
4,Great Clean Comedy DVD,This DVD was very funny and you did not have to worry about trying to tune out all the profanity. I recommend purchasing for DVD collection or as a great gift!
3,So so so,"Wow, this is a totally different side of Steve. Although, it was not as funny as I had expected it was still good."
1,sucks,pure and simply the biggest waste of time for me in the past month. not funny at all. don't bother.
1,You have GOT to be kidding me!,"This is anything but funny. I obviously am not of the same ethnic group that might find this funny. It's just plain dumb. Even some of the audience in the video looks bored and offended. How Steve Harvey EVER got in to a major Christian event like MegaFest, I'll never know. He takes advantage of it however, and slams Christians, Catholics, church, and is just in his own world out there and even makes the remark that he doesn't care if he's offensive, he's got your money now. Save your money, buy something funnier than this, like Gone With The Wind."
4,Listen,"This DVD was pretty funny and he didn't have to cuss to do it. For those of you who don't understand, This DVD was done for a show that was put on by Bishop T.D. Jakes so if you were expecting the usual cussing and stuff, then maybe this wasn't for you but I definitely bought it."
5,Best ever,This had me laughing so hard that nothing would come out after a while. You need this in your libray trust me.
5,Not many better,"He is not a new comedian; right now he is the Man! What a range with clean or dirty jokes/stories. Mr. Harvey is one of the best out there.. OH, this DVD...Great."
3,my bad,I bought the wrong book in my over zealous needs. But I'm sure the book has an application for someone. It arrived quickly and in good shape.
4,good product,"This is a good item for the price, used it for tailgating and for cooking on the beach. Some reviews said it was a little unsteady but I didn't think so."
3,A little wobbly...,"The cart works fine and should function as a portable unit well, but we thought we'd use it both for travel and at home. However, the unit is a little wobbly for everyday use, particularly when you are wire brushing the grill off after use."
1,junky,"The WeberQ grill itself is great, but I don't know why this cart is getting so many good reviews.... this cart is basically worth about $1.00. It wobbles, it is hard to fold down, and it is not very well-designed. I have to guess the grill itself was designed by very good engineers but this cart was just an after-thought, designed by, well... not so good engineers. I built my own cart. You can also just get a plastic storage container with wheels if you shop around at Walmart or Home Depot. And you can put the grill on top. The grill radiates negligble heat on the bottom so it won't melt the plastic. On the other hand, the cart that Weber sells generates a suspicion of lame engineering."
2,QGrill Folding Cart,"I love the compact folding feature. Great for small storage areas!! However, the cart has a lot of wabble to it. It could have ben made a little sturdier. Other than that, it works great."
4,Excellent product,"As we didn't want to be using our grill on a table or tailgate of the truck, this item was perfect. Set up is easy, once you get the hang of it. When broke down, it takes of little space and can have grill stored with it. As we have had this several years now, it has stood up well in all kinds of conditions. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is there should be a locking mechanism or something to hold the grill in place as it an easily slide out of the spots for the grills feet. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who has a Weber Q grill."
4,Good Stuff,"This cart is great. Other reviewers mention that it is not sturdy and can be a bit rickety. This is true, and especially since my Weber Q 220 has those plastic fold out trays/wings, this makes placing food items on there a bit more precarious. However, this cart was purchased for its portability, and it functions great in that manner. It does indeed take a bit of getting used to in terms of folding it down and bringing it back up with the grill still on."
5,A must-have accessory for your Weber Q grill,"Easy to use and store! Provides stability, and easy transport of Weber Q."
4,Pleased,"Because it's portable it obviously is not going to be as sturdy as a permanent stand, however, I am pleased with its stability. It surely is not going to stand up to abuse, yet if treated with reasonable care it should hold up for a few years or more."
3,Weber Rolling Cart,"It is a pretty simple cart. The grill sits loosely on top. There are a couple of catches that one end of the grill slides in to. One has to be careful to grab just the cart handle, not the grill handle, when moving the cart. It is a bit awkward."
4,Good cart ... but watch with the big propane tank!,"Overall, a very good and portable stand for my Baby Q..... But!I decided to go with the large propane tank that will last me probably the whole season instead of buying the smaller 14oz canisters, which only last one or two barbeques. The wire rack on the bottom of this cart was SCREAMING when I put this big heavy propane tank on the bottom of it. It's also kinda awkward down there and it slides around a bit when you move the cart so you really have to watch it! It's a little better when you slide it to either end of the wire rack to take the pressure off the middle of it, which was bending noticeably. If I can figure out a way to secure it down there, I think it will be fine.Other than that, well worth the money for this grill!"
4,Works as advertised,"I bought this to go along with a Baby Q I had given my college-aged daughter and she loves it - easy set up, easy to move around, and easy breakdown. She also said the storage underneath is large enough for a small cooler."
3,Durable,Leave it to Weber to think of it all. I got this as a gift for mom to go along with the Weber Q that I bought for her and it is very convenient and very sturdy. I would certainly agree that it is worth the $$.
2,Flimsy,Don't by this flimsy cart!!! It is not strong enough to support a bbq. I returned mine after one use.
4,A must have!,"If you have the WeberQ, this is a storage must-have. Nice and sturdy. Rolls well and isn't tippy. Folds up nice and small. One star demotion for having a slightly lower gauge metal components than I would prefer and plastic (rather than rubber) wheels, but both of those make the whole thing lighter and easier to move around--so you decide if it should be five stars based on these tiny quibbles!"
4,"It's silver not white, but attaches easily","This works and connects easy, however, I thought the photo made it look white, but is very silvery/grey. The rest of my cords are white, so I was disappointed, and there's no mention of the color in the description."
4,"What a readable, enjoyable book.","I loved this book. I find Calculus extremely intimidating and I never have quite grasped the importance of this topic. This book seems to pull things together, presents material you would not find in a ""regular"" text."
1,Severely lacking in practicality...,"I agreely wholeheartedly with the reviewer who called this a ""Calculus Appreciation"" textbook. It includes lengthy histories of the theories and processes highlighted in the chapters, but completely fails to elaborate on them or provide thorough proofs or adequate examples and explanations. There are also absolutely no answers whatsoever to the practice problems; it's impossible to check/verify one's understanding of the material with this book. For all practical purposes... useless, in my opinion."
1,Calculus Appreciation,"This book could easily be titled ""Calculus Appreciation."" Just as music appreciation texts talk endlessly about music and musicians without requiring the reader to develop proficiency with an instrument, this book prattles on about calculus without requiring the reader to develop proficiency with calculus.Good math books are exercise-rich with solutions to at least half the exercises. That isn't the case here(much easier for a lazy author, not necessary for lazy students). This book lacks the rigor needed by those who would like to pursue advanced topics in calculus or differential equations. As a history of calculus it oversimplifies by using modern notation to tidy up historical problems.For those who only want to gain an ""appreciation"" of calculus this book may be enough. For those who want to understand calculus and develop some proficiency with it, try Courant or Swokowski or Spivak."
4,great all conditions camera for backpackers,"having taken this camera on several backpacking excursions, short and long, i have found it to be both reliable and easy to use in just about any situation. i have taken the 105WR through the silty waters of the Paria river, AZ, used it in downpours, fallen in quicksand with it strapped to my pack...and it still continues to produce incredibly clear photos. however, the camera is not always color accurate due to it's focal averaging system (hence the 4 instead of 5) but for a light, DURABLE point and shoot i couldn't ask for any better."
3,"Two Years of Excellent Pix, then it will break","I have bought two of these. The first lasted exactly two years, then stopped working. I bought another one, because the pictures it takes under almost all circumstances are fantastic. It worked for exactly two years, then ....broke! Must be planned obsolescence. Anyway, I am now shopping for a Minolta or Olympus, which hopefully will last longer. I would have given this product 5 stars for picture quality, but have deducted two because of its lack of durability."
3,"Informative, but not Insightful","Pinsky starts off on an upbeat note, successfully discussing religious topics found in early Disney films, but as the book progresses through the company's animation history, Pinsky looses most of his analysis and commentary in favor of summarization. I felt that Pinsky did a good job explaining the premise of the post-Disney era films (beginning in the 80s and through the 90s - his insight picks up again in the 2000s) he lacked the spiritual commentary I was looking for, the commentary the book's subtitle ""Faith, Trust, and Pixie Dust,"" advertises.Overall, I would suggest this book as a good read, but there are probably more informative books out there for research purposes or more thought-provoking discussion."
2,Textbook Writing,I found this book to be boring and reminded me of reading a text book in college. Big disappointment.
2,"The Gospel According to Disney: Faith, Trust, and Pixie Dust","The Gospel According to Disney : Faith, Trust, and Pixie Dust is not helpfulunless you can get copies of the films and watch them along with reading the book. Some of the films are out of date and can not be borrowed at the film store."
2,Not for Disney Fans,"Althought the book was insightful, it is not for those who are avid fans of Disney. In most chapters Pinsky tries to search for something that is not there. 3 year old girls do not see Cinderella as a woman with ""Cinderella syndrome"" searching for her Prince Charming, they see it for what it is... a fairy tale. As for me and my nieces we will watch all the fairy tales and learn from them what Disney is trying to show, that dreams do come true. This book is definately not for someone who is hoping to see Disney in a positive light."
1,"Good title, BAD book!","If ever there was a book that embodied the saying, ""Don't judge a book by its cover"", this book is it. I picked it up at my local Barnes and Nobles, expecting an entertaining and inspiring read. From page one, I felt my stomach knot up and the more I read, the more disgusted I became. This man not only slanders Uncle Walt's good name(calling such characters as Mickey, Donald, Tink and so forth satanic because they believe in wishing on a star instead of praying to God) but implies that anyone who follows Disney's moral code is destined for eternal condemnation. Pinsky then goes to openly voice his support for the Southern Baptist Boycott, a boycott that was made up of convervative Christians making false allegations of materials in Disney films that never appeared. To all die-hard Disney fans, DON'T READ THIS BOOK! To Pinsky, leave the book-writting to someone with real vision because you wouldn't know creativity if it handed you a business card!"
3,"Shoe is beautiful, but slightly uncomfortable",Beautiful shoe...fits true to size...great price! Something with the straps rubs against my left little toe and I don't have corns!
2,Looks fake,Yes I know it is fake but some look nice this just does not measure up I sent it back right away.
1,Horrifically overpriced crap,"I knew I was going to be annoyed as soon as I opened the box. The ""fit and finish"" of this kit was cheap from the getgo. It was a pain just putting the stand together, one of the boards broke during assembly, a little titlebond fixed that up.After a few rounds on the lawn, 3 of the mallets had severe dents in them. This is not something I expect from a set in this price range, altough I could tell by the cheapness and softness of the wood that this was going to happen. I also broke a wicket on one of my shots (no not a send).Stay away from this, by any competing product in this price range, this one is a stinker."
3,star wars dvds 1 and 2,the star wars movies of course cannot be compared to the original movies but they are a good way to introduce how anikan was not the villian but actually the victim of a horrible life. these star wars movies are still very good and are good to fit in with the original movies.
1,No Widescreen,These movies are both great though Attack of the Clones is clearly the best of the two. Still how come only the full screen versions come in a four disc pack. Why is there no Widescreen 4 pack. Widescreen is supieor especially in a Star Wars movie which look especially horrible in Pan Scan. Release a widescreen two pack this is rediculous.
4,Decent Movies,"They are acceptable movies for the Star Wars franchise, not as good as the Episodes IV to VI, but are pretty decent."
1,Ewwwwwwwww!,"I remember watching these two films at the theater. After the movies finished, I had a sudden desire to go take a shower. Basically, when you buy this box set, you are buying a crap burger. Sorry Lucas, this is one movie fan your not going to f*** with!"
2,I feel sick!,"These movies suffer from: bad acting, bad dialogue, over the top CGI fxs, lack of emotions, and too much overall politics. I love the original trilogy but these prequels are the worst ever."
1,No way,"I am a big fan of the old star wars trilogy. Lucas could not handle the new trilogy, it is simply not star wars like."
1,Buy the separate Widescreen releases instead!,"It puzzles me why Fox only chose to offer a PAN-AND-SCAN box of the first two Star Wars prequels.If you're a fan of these films, it's much better to buy the separate widescreen releases of each. You won't get the pretty slipcase, but at least you're getting the whole movie and not a butchered pan-and-scan version.It is rumored that when Episode III comes out on DVD this November, Fox will release a box set of all three prequels in their proper Widescreen Anamorphic format. Hopefully that rumor is true. (Though, since I already own the WS versions of Episodes I and II, I'll forgo the box and pick up the regular release of III.)"
5,May I write you in Spanish?,Me gusta mucho como canta Chavela Vargas porque pone mucho sentimiento y es alguien que he admirado toda la vida.
5,Great Album. Where Did She Go!!!,"Wild As You Want To Be is pretty much how Wah Wah put the album down. This was not only a great album to listen to, but fun as well. To be honest, I never heard of her until I read a review on another female artist and Wah Wah was listed as a related artist. I didn't know what to think at first, but I had to buy it. I see now there are any available cd of her left, but I tell you if you didn't get a chance to hear it then you are out of luck. She came off hard as hell on this disk and I enjoyed it very much. I hope that if she is still in the rap game she would give us another on because this was hott. I love underground artist because they usually have the best stuff to listen to. If this ever come available again, get it was while it is there. I will say you have to pay a steep price for it, but you will not be disappointed. Nice album Wah Wah."
3,Pretty music,"Pretty music, but I was hoping for some microtonal dexterity. The result to me not at all what i would meditate to; in fact I thought it was rather bland."
5,very. very good,We watched this show and enjoyed every minute of it. The actors did a really good job of portraying this story.
1,"Good overview, bad usage",If you are looking for a good overview of Java - read the book. If you are looking for a good book for Visual J++ - look elsewhere.The problem with the book is that it only devotes about ten pages to using the Visual J++ interface to design dialogs. There is no depth to it at all. The wimpy book which came with VJ1.0 had more to it than this book had.
5,THIS BOOK SAVED MY SANITY!,"As a new mother of an infant daughter, at about 8 weeks, I was starting to lose a grip- my baby who had previously been quiet and easy going, became a nightmare every day from 6 - 10 pm. My husband and I were at our wits end. Then I remembered this book, and pulled it out to review. We put our daughter on E.A.S.Y immediately - and it was shocking what a big difference it made! She again became easy going and sweet. It took a big reminder from this book for me to really tune in to what was going on with her - and that I needed to always be listening for her cues to the next thing (read and you will understand). I have recommended this book to all of my pregnant friends, first or not... and purchased it for one recently. I highly recommend this book and it's suggestions. You may not be able to incorporate all of them, but it is definitely worth the read!"
1,Terrible,"Don't get it, not worth it. She shouldn't be a LCD. I wonder how she get to become a LC... She doesn't support breast feeding which is a shame!!! It may be difficult but its the best for baby and most natural way. Formulas are not natural."
1,Don't buy,Don't buy this book.The ISBN # will be changed and price will be lowered during it's second printing..through a different publisher.Don't buy it!!!
5,good video on intro and basics to capoeira,great to keep me in shape when im not able to attend my capoeira classes
3,It's not even that it's short....,"First, this is a good tape, and it's a good introduction to capoeira. I had purchased this as there aren't any capoeira groups near me, and I was missing the movement (so I wasn't going into this hoping for a work out or anything advanced.) I don't know if I'd really call it a work out though. I found myself getting more out of the warm up than the lessons. The combination moves weren't very vigorous, but they gave you an idea of the movement and it's something to build on. If you've never come across capoeira before (it seems like a strange thing to pick up randomly through a dvd, but that's just me) than you really need to watch her do the different kicks first. A friend of mine tried the dvd, and was flustered and confused as the work out doesn't give instruction. It was nice to hear the music though. Along the lines of its length 27 minutes is being overly generous to the actual time you're moving."
3,Capoeira Workout,I have nothing against women. However this video is hardly a workout video and it is designed at a slower pace to teach women.
3,The Capoeira Workout,"I cannot rate on an actual opinion because I have received it, but have not even opened it. I became too ill to work with it, so it is on hold."
3,Very short workout!,"I used to do capoeira for a few years but haven't had time to go to classes for almost a year, so I was very excited to see that this DVD was coming out because I thought it would be a nice way to continue with my practice on my own. I did it for the first time yesterday, however, and was very disappointed by how short it is.Although the DVD does start with a review of the basic moves/kicks you'll be doing and a brief history of this martial art, the workout itself is only about 20 minutes long, including the warmup. There is also no cool-down or stretch at the end.On the positive side, all of the music is by Mestre Bimba and there are some good sample rodas to watch and learn from.Overall, it's an alright workout that provides a nice overview of the basic moves (like Beno, Queixada, Martelo, etc.), but I felt like it could have been much longer."
3,Different from what I'm used to!,It looks like it is a decent workout. I just didn't have enough floor space in my house to actually do the workout. Make sure you have enough floor space!
3,Room for improvement,"Instructor did an amazing job explaining the moves in workout #1. Can't say the same for workout #2. She just keeps saying ""And go"" - then jumps into a routine. The workout segments (combined) are much too short. An added 15-20 mins would have made all the difference."
4,Newbie,"Another such group is coming to my area which prompted a desire to seek exposure and so I bought several cds. For me -- in my status -- this was the best if, for no other reason, it contains a dvd. The stage show is half the entertainment (I believe this group is more restrained and conservative in terms of its stage show). The coordination and concentration are impressive as are, of course, the performers' physiques. There is entertaining inclusion of women as well."
3,Not as good as expected,"Image and sound is OK, but I expected some of the more typical pieces for taiko on this DVD. There is much of the big standing drum, this pieces are too long. The mix with some traditional dance and flaute is interesting, but some things are very repetitive. The extra is just one of the pieces from the concert, but with some video from what can only be suposed to show Sado island. A short interview in Japanese, no titles or translation. After a short image from their workshop, I was expecting something like an inside look into training on Sado, but nothing like that happened."
4,Great representative recording but wish it were DTS or at least ...,"The twin discs are compelling in providing the essence of what the Kodo troupe is all about. Recorded in 2003 and released in 20o4 by Sony Music Japan, you'll find references to the ""double D"" Dolby mark but unfortunately the soundtrack wasn't recorded in a format that would have done much better by this group such as DTS. That said most AVRs will be able to extrapolate the tracks into a satisfying presentation. One simply wishes for something more state of the art.... hence the 4 stars vice 5."
2,Not Like the Commercial,"If you are buying this video because you are in love with the car commercial, or have seen the Bose promotional video, don't buy this KODO because that is not on this video. The video begins with a nice intro, then goes into a very long sequence where two very athletic and talented fellows play the largest drum for a very long time. Just when you think you can't possibly stand to watch them play the same sequence any more, they switch drummers, and start the whole thing over again. Then they do the same thing again. Just when you are ready to turn this video off, then another nice sequence comes on with some girl drummers. Unfortunately, that sequence only lasts a very short time, then they bring out the big drum again. I loved the commercial and would have loved to have had that on the video. I intend to resell my copy of this DVD as it was very disappointing to me."
1,Disappointing,"I wish I hadn't purchased this one. Although it is interesting, extreme close ups of the drummers wearing next to nothing did nothing for me. I enjoy watching Taiko drums with a lot of drummers and different types of drums. Most of this was the huge drum. Although it was good to listen to, don't bother with a DVD. The visual experience just isn't there."
3,Nikon GPS adapter Cord,"Cord works as advertised, providing half the interface to a Garmin GPS but it has several disconcerting characteristics1. Cord adapts compatible Nikon SLRs to GPs units so that GPS data can be recorded in EXIF files. However the cord termininates in an RS 232 connector and a 2nd cord with RS-232 to Garmin interface is required for the GPS data transfer to occur. A single cord with Nikon to Garmin connectors would be much more convenient2. The RS-232 connectors have 2 screws to insure that this connection doesn't separate. Howver the threads and sockets are mismatched so the screws can't be used. On occasion my RS 232 coupling separated3. The NIkon cord is very expensive and very short. The Garmin portion of the cable pair is much longer and 1/3 the price of the Nikon cord"
3,Nikon MC-35 does it jobb but could have been better!,I bought the MC-35 to connect an GPS unit to my Nikon D200.It did what it suppose to do as an interface between the camera and GPS BUT!!I can't understand way I should have to use two boxes connected to each other and then to the camera when it would have been much more convenient to have it all in one box!Then I found this solution:[..]
1,ISADORA the SCREACHER,"I'm sorry but this woman's music just simply grates on my nerves;her monotone horrid and tiny voice range is hurtful to the ears -she actually had the arrogance to criticize Tori Amos for being ""screeching and narciissistic""- when her own music couldn't begin to hold a candle to Tori Amos!PLEASE- save your money and your pets ears--(they will run & hide under the bed!) .... go buy GYPSY or WENDY RULE and hear some soothing AUTHENTIC Witch Music--- not this harsh, harpie pretender!!! YUCCCHHH !!! Worst attempt at pagan music YET !!! Don't waste your money please."
2,i want my money back,"The only good thing about this toy is that it keeps the sun off of the child's head. We had to take it back twice because the push handle for the parent does not fit in the hole correctly - we eventually had to glue it in the hole - the wheels have already cracked (we've only had the toy for 6 months, and the buttons for the ""car sounds"" stick."
5,What a fun toy,"All I can say is that this a great toy for little boys who love cars. My 12 month old loves anything with wheels and this was perfect for him. It could use rubber wheels, though. Quite noisy, even on smooth concrete. Also, a safety strap would be nice. It's a little hard to put the handle together but after a little filing and a new screw, it works great."
4,Assembly is CRAZY!!!,"My daughter will not stop sitting in this toy. She loves it. But she does not know what my husband & I went through to put it together. I installed phone jacks with no problem in my house, but this drove me crazy. First, picture instructions only without any words is insane. You see a man in the picture with a hammer hammering in the wheels. They should draw beads of sweat on his face & the look of pure frustration. We had to bang these wheels down with incredible force for an hour.Our car was also missing a piece of the push handle, which I still not have received from the manf.My little girl loves this car, & it is adorable BUT not really worth the aggravation of assembly. Also, plastic wheels are so loud, I can't here anything around me such as the person I am with or cars coming up from behind me, but everyone hears us coming. Needs rubber wheels and a seatbelt!"
3,concerned,"My daughter received this toy for her first birthday from her grandparents. My daughter absolutely loves it, but she always stands up. I went down to the store to be certain that it was not defective. I cannot comprehend that the manufacturer did not install a seat belt. so...we are off to rig up the car with a seatbelt. We have been looking for one and uanble to find it. I read a review and will check out the little tikes website as suggested. It just is too bad that after you buy the car you stil need to go out and purchase another part and then install it."
5,Love!,"My daughter got this on her 1st. birthday.We both love it, and we get alot of attention and smiles as we walk around the neighborhood.It steers nicely, like the canopy on the sunny days.Nice buy, you'll get a big, ""WWWWOOOOOOOOWWWW!!!"""
3,Dangerous without a seatbelt,I must say that this is a very cute car but it you have a climber it can be very dangerous. I recieved this car as a birthday gift for my 1 year old son and he will only sit it in a few minutes before he stands up. Thank goodness he has not fallen out. I have had it for about 2 weeks now and used it a couple times thinking maybe this time he will just sit but nope he wants to stand right up everytime which makes for a very stressful walk. I usually end up just holding him and pushing the car back. Also the wheels are very noisy. The handle does work great for steering Unfortunately I am not going to use this little car anymore until he is old enough to use it w/o the floor board it is just to much of a risk. Also the sun shade is great except that you cannot see what your baby is doing so keep this in mind if you live in hot climate and are buying it for the sun shade.
4,FUN BUT NEEDS A SAFTY STRAP,"Although my son has alot of fun while in his convertable, it should have a safty strap........my little guy is a climber & gets right out & there is nothing to stop him!"
4,Great 1st Car!,We got this for our son's 1st birthday and he absolutely loves it! My only complaint is that there is no seatbelt. My son tries to stand up and turn around in it which isn't so safe!
5,Great car for the developing child,My 1 yr old got this for her birthday from grandma. It works great. We can push her around in it and she stays put. She likes the horn and other gadgets on the dashboard. She takes rides in the house on rainy days and outside on the sidewalk when we have good weather. The tires are not as loud as everyone claims.
2,Can't use it!,"VERY disappointed in this product, we have it put together for 2 weeks now and still can't get the handle into the base of the car, 2 grown (STRONG) men have tried to push it down to line up with the hole to screw it together and it""s just not going all the way down. ALSO One front tire tends to get stuck turning inward, it would of been nice if they made the steering wheel control the tires.A seat belt/strap would also be a huge plus considering the age group it is targeted for."
1,Bad very bad!,"I ordered this little car for my daughter's first birthday. I recieved it very quickly, but when I went to go put it together I had quite a few broken/ defective parts. So I had to call the people and they sent me a form so that I could ship it back for free. So I packed it all up when to the UPS store and shipped it back. Than they sent me another one, and yet again it was all messed up. The car itself was all banged up, and it also had a few missing parts. I called the people up, and had to be on hold for a long time, and I just asked for my money back, which they did. Spent way to much time and effort trying to get this car to work. Ended up just going to Mejiers and buying a car that was similar to it. I wouldn't buy this b/c you probaly more likly than not going to have MANY problems."
3,Features for parents and kids,"I purchased this for my 18 mo. old daughter. The removeable floor was key since she could not operate on her own yet. When she can, we'll remove the floor. The push handle is also great for the parent. I'm not a big fan of the convertable top because I can't see the child completely from behind the top in it's raised position. My daughter enjoys riding in it and does like to play with the sensory features. Overall, good quality and fun for the child."
3,"Great Car, not so great supplier...eToys","This is a really great outdoor toy. so versatile and hours of fun for little kids!Our complaint is about eToys the supplier. They sent us what was obviously someone else's return. It was missing important parts, like the parts that connect the wheels to the car AND the instructions!!! This was extremely disappointing for our son who was so excited as soon as he saw the box on the porch. It's hard to explain to a toddler that their new toy can't be used because it isn't complete!The car is packed back in it's box and still sitting on the porch, where it's been for 3 days now, waiting to be picked up for return to eToys who do not have a phone contact only e-mail. We are waiting for our refund.we ended up going to a different site to buy this again."
5,Love it,I got this toy for my son's first birthday. He absolutely loves it! We had to hide it because he wanted to be in it all the time. I was a little worried reading the other reviews because it doesn't have a seatbelt. This hasn't been a problem at all. I push him all over the neighborhood. Since you are looking at him the whole time it is easy to get to him if he decides to stand up.
4,Safety Belt Feature,This is a studry car but it should have a safety built featurefor children from 12 months.
3,Just Not For My Son,"My son received this for his first birthday, and he had a wonderful time being pushed around the neighborhood in it. When he outgrew the need to be pushed, he also lost interest completely in the car! He is 2 1/2 and is almost too big to sit in it, being 3 ft tall and 38 lbs. My daughter played with her cozy coupe until she was 5! So it goes to show you, I thought the toy would be a big hit for years to come, but each child is different."
5,Cutest little car,"I purchased this car for my son's 1st birthday and he loves being in it. I had researched these types of cars for a while since I wanted to get the best one for our son and this one seemed to be the best. Yes, this car does need a seat belt for the children, but on the same note, I just tell my son to sit down and he has no problems. My son loves the buttons and all of the gadgets to push and pull. I love the idea of the floor board and the handle coming out when they are older. I would recommend this product to all of my friend."
1,Deluxe Cozy Convertible Car,"My daughter likes to ride in this car, but gets bored very easily. I like the sun shade, but it doesn't cover much of her body. The hubcabs rotate and the wheels are very loud. I don't know if I have the wrong size screw, but the handle is not securely on and I have to keep tightening the screw. It needs a seatbelt. The directions were very confusing. I would not buy again."
5,An assembly nightmare,"First let me say that my daughter loves this car. We bought this for her first birthday. She is now three and still loves riding in it. She especially loves the rag top and the sounds. For her the car is a hit.For the parents, the assembly was a 5 on a scale of 10. Unfortunately, a packet of accessories was left out of the package, as well as, a piece of the push handle. Little Tikes shipped out the accessories in a few days. We had them within two weeks. The push handle was back ordered for 6 months. When we finally received it, The push handle was too big for the pre-molded hole. At that point we gave up. We were too used to pushing her around with out it."
5,seat belt,"After reading all the reviews on all the push cars made, we decided on this one because it offerred the most for the money.However,1 year olds like to lean over and are starting to climb,the cheaper cars come with seat belts! My husband used his drill and made a slot on each side of the chair back and we slid a 1"" nylon strap through it and fastened a safety buckle and VIOLA.....we have a seat belt. Now I can put my 1 year old grandson in it with no fear of him falling out while the canopy is up! Get it together Little Tykes.....it's a great little car but how about babys safety?? It took us no time to put one in so I'm sure it can be done when they are manufacturred with no problem! Other than that I love the car! The handle is a great height for tall Mom's and Dad's! Rubber wheels would be nice but I'd opt for the seat belt over the tires!"
1,Terrible Car for Toddlers,My biggest complaint is that this car does not have a seatbelt. My son is 10 months old and I get very nervous that he will fall out and if you put the top up you cannot even see your child. I am shocked that they did not include a seat belt like other riding cars have. I actually had to go out and buy the Step2 buggy (which my older son had) because it is a much better product and includes a seat belt. Do not buy this!
5,A Gift from Grandma,"This was purchased as a gift for my 15 month old granddaughter. I have not seen the ""convertable"", but I am told that it is a big hit with my granddaughter and the neighbor children. I am told that she keeps busy working all the buttons with sounds and waving as she rides. The handle is a great back saver for the mom."
1,Terrible!,"This toy is so unsafe. There are no doors for easy-in/easy-out with Toddlers. PLEASE don't buy this, it's so scary to see your child almost fall out of it head first!!"
1,I HATE THIS TOY,First off it was sooo hard to put together and then it was cracked on the bottom so i had to send it bac and when i got the new one together it was not at all what i expectited!! The radio is horrible! - the handle that is suppose to let me push her stinks cause the front wheels go whereever they want to not where i want - and the same when she is trying to push it with her feet while she is in it. I hate it its worth a try for yourself. I def.dont think its worth the money tho.
4,Tested in the store and had to have it!!!!,We took our 14 month old to Toys R Us to blow some dough and we happened upon this car. He was instantly sold!!! He loved it so much we had to have it. The store was out and so was every other store in Rochester that sells it. Another parent we met at the store said her baby loved it and the removable floor board is a great feature. Also you don't have to kill your back to give the kid a push. It can be used outdoors or indoors. Can't wait to get it from the web!!!!
2,dangerous! get the original model instead.,"My 18 mo daughter received this for Christmas. She loved riding in it. However, I don't understand how Little Tikes could make such a toy on wheels, and the only way in is to CLIMB in (or have a parent put you in.) So, we could not leave the toy out for her to play with, as it was such a danger to her. She is not yet able to climb very well, and the thing IS ON WHEELS. We have lots of hard floors for her to fall on. And, as so many people have already said, it totally needs a seatbelt. We exchanged this for the original Cozy Coupe, and she loves it just as much! She loves having a door to open and close, and the hard top prevents her from standing up."
1,Complete Piece of Junk,The steering handle that inserts into the rear of the car could not be inserted due to a molding problem. The left front wheel will not stay attached and keeps falling out. Do not buy this product. Had to throw away.
3,UNHAPPY,"I HAVE TRIED TO CHANGE THE BATTIERS MANY TIMES AND I ONLY USE THE BEST IT, AND IT WONT MAKE ANY SOUNDS I CANT RETURN IT CAUS EI THREW THE BOX AWAY NOT KNOWING ID HAVE PROBLEMS WITH SO IS THERE ANYTHING U GUYS CAN DO TO HELP THANK U"
3,Needs a seatbelt so my son can't stand up while riding in...,"This car is adorable. It has a removable floor for younger children to ride in without their feet dragging on the ground. My 13 month old loves the steering wheel, ""gear shift"", and musical buttons. The horn is weak and if pushed slowly/softly doesn't beep. My husband is an Engineer and hated putting this together. The handle didn't fit properly and we had to re-drill the hole. Now the handle is loose so steering can be tricky. My son LOVES this car though. We push our son in this car on nightly walks...however, this week he has learned to stand up while we're pushing the car. He thinks it is fun to climb out on his own. We really wish there was a seatbelt that keeps him from standing up. It has gotten so bad that we can only get to the end of our driveway before he tries turning around and climbing out. I wish Little Tykes made a seatbelt for this car for the younger children. For now we're back to using the stroller on our walks."
3,OUCH!,"I totally agree that this car is very dangerous for children, we just bought this car for my son a week ago and took him out on a walk in it and sure enough he FELL OUT of it!! He got a big knot on his forehead and all kinds of scrapes on his face and nose! It needs a SEATBELT!!! I would not reccommend this car to anyone unless it gets recalled and has a seatbelt or harness installed in it!! I am very, very, angry!!"
3,Don't do it,"If you're thinking of buying the Deluxe Cozy Convertible Car, don't do it. Ever since the day we got ours, the handle (that attaches to the back so you can push it) has been a HUGE, CONSTANT problem. The car would be great, except the handle has bent and doesn't work. You're better off with a different car or push item. This one is not worth the frustration."
3,Review for convertable car,We recieved this car as a gift - and as a parent of a two year old -this toy car should have SOME SORT OF SAFETY BELT FOR 60.00!
4,Hot Wheels,"My 14-month old son loves his new ""sports"" car. It took about 20 minutes to put together and we were off. It could use a seatbelt, since my son like to turn and look at me while I push...otherwise an excellent product"
1,Beware of defects and missing parts!,"We bought this car after returning a defective Little Tykes Princess Cozy Coupe for our daughter. The first convertible was missing several parts, so we had to return it. We assembled the second convertible and went to put the last piece in (the parent handle - the very reason we liked this product) only to realize that the hole to put in the handle was obstructed by plastic. We returned it to the store where we bought it and got the floor model at a discount. Our daughter loves it, but honestly, this took up an entire Sunday with headaches (not to mention the headaches with the prior Princess Cozy Coupe). Ugh. I will never buy Little Tykes again. These toys are cheaply made, which is not a surprise. What is surprising is that we went through 3 Little Tykes products and found each of them to either be missing parts or defective. It was very disappointing and frustrating. I do not recommend this product or Little Tykes products if you wish to keep your sanity."
1,Poorly made car,"We have the regular cozy coupe and are happy with it. we bought the convertible because my son is tall,and were so dissapointed. There is no door, so if the child is tall, it is impossible for them to get in. Then the front wheel keeps coming off. It is such a poor level of quality as compared to teh cozy coupe, we noticed that right away when we were putting it together."
4,Fun...with drawbacks,"I bought this for my daughter's first birthday, but was first disappointed in trying to put it together. My husband and I are both mechanically inclined, but we had problems assembling the car - especially putting the wheels on. Ours did not ""just snap right in"". We had to pound and pound to get them on.The biggest issue we had with this was that, while it is rated for 12 months and up, our one-year-old had difficulty staying in the seat. First, she would keep sliding down off the seat into the area where her feet were supposed to be. There was no seatbelt to help her stay put. She also kept trying to climb out of the car, almost before I could begin to push her. This, too, would have been remedied by a seatbelt.Now that she's a little older and used to sitting in the car, she loves it and rides around smiling."
5,Too much fun,"My daughter almost 1 and almost 2 can't get enough of this car. I even bring it inside the house when we can't go out. They are constantly wanting to go for a ride. Lately, we have taken it on our 1 mile walk. The only thing I wish it had is a jump seat in the back. We make do my adding a small pillow. This way they both get to ride in the car. It's as easy to push as a stroller. The tires do make some noise on the asphalt but are much quieter on cement."
4,"Cut and fun, but safety concerns","I bought this for my 1-year old grandson. He loves it, but the first ride he figured out he wanted out after a while on our walk. What a DANGER! If I didn't pay constant attention, he could have really hurt himself. I also agree it's too loud due to the plastic wheels. If they're going to market it as a stroller-type device with a push handle, they have a lot to improve upon. I'm not sure if I'll return it yet; we need to see how he adjusts to sitting down and not trying to get up because I am concerned about his safety. I have written Little Tykes about my concerns - I invite others to do so also and wonder if they will recall this and add a safety harness/belt and other modifications parents/grandparents would like to see."
5,Spelling correction,"CORRECTION OF AMELIA ISLAND REVIEW:Misspellings of ""boundaries"" and of author's name ""Amir"" instead of ""Amin"""
1,TurboTax Tanks,"I used TaxCut for years and switched to TurboTax seven years ago for one year. It miscalculated a depreciation, so I went back to TaxCut. Last year I got sick of TaxCut because it seemed to be entirely oriented to selling advice from H&R; Block.Looking for the best deal on TurboTax this year, I found a rebate from the sales price...plus [another] rebate for purchasing the new version of Quicken - or so I thought. Turns out it is one or the other. I guess that's OK, since the reviews of Quicken 2003 say stay away.Now, after the Jan 15 software update, I still can't import my 2002 TaxCut return, nor is it loading my Quicken data. Additionally, I've been searching the web for external opinions of TurboTax while waiting for their Online Chat help to answer, only to discover that the general opinion of both the TurboTax product and their product support is extremely negative.It appears that Intuit intends to go out of business because they can't put a decent product on the street anymore."
1,Ripped OFF,"I could not give this NO STARS!! ARGH!! I got ripped off from every rebate because I bought it ahead of time and by the time I used it the 30 days from purchase expired and I had already used the program. I e mailed the company and got NO response. They have very poor customer service and I was a faithful customer for almost 10 years to their products. I will not up grade anything I have of theirs (Quicken)and eventually I will replace it with something their competitors. I don't take it kindly when someone does me wrong and I never, never forget!! I have used the Tax Cut for a couple of years and like it ever better. Don't fall for their rebate ...and lack of morals ... Boycott!! :)"
3,"Get the regular turbotax, not this","The name ""Home and Business"" is misleading. This product will *not* help you do any taxes for your business. It will help you print out W2s and other forms for any employees, but it won't help you complete a business tax return if you have a partnership, LLC or corporation. For that, you need the similarly-named TurboTax For Business.If you have a sole proprietorship, this product might be useful if you have lots of depreciation. However, all it will do is a 1040 for individuals. It does a good job of this, and it is more helpful than regular Turbotax in calculating depreciation et al. for Schedule C. But again, I stress: if you are not a sole proprietor, you likely will not need this.The remainder of the product is the same as TurboTax Deluxe for individuals."
4,Great Camera Value for Money,If u are looking for a Medium range Camera Go for This Camera. It has a Good Panaromic Mode for Photographing Skylines and Wide angles. The Controls Are Cool. A Bit Bulky But u can accept it for the way it shoots Pictures. Picture Quality is Crystal Clear. I have shot with this camera the Niagara Falls and It came Great. I strongly recommend this Camera if u are looking for more features at a reasonable price.
2,"Funny in parts, but too insecure to ""stick""","Tracey is way too much in ""need"" of a man. This is not a book that I would recommend to my bookworm girlfriends. Its one saving grace is that just when I was about to put it down and give up on it, I would come across something hilariously funny and actually laugh out loud. But all in all the book was pretty disappointing."
1,I shouldn't even rate this book,"I should not even rate this book because I have cheated. I did not read it. Well, I read up to page 14, but I was whined about what a pathetic book this was at every other sentence which led to my boyfriend literally ripping ""Slightly Single"" from my hands, hurling it across the room, and motioning to the bookcase for me pick something that would salvage the brain cells that Wendy Markham had not annihilated.In short, this so-called ""novel"" contrives to be hip while writing in such a manner that everything has mundane yet overly described features (she says, bitterly, typing out the words of her amazon review with disdain, noticing that her short fingernails need a good manicure.....) Ick."
1,Definitely Not on My Top 10 List,"Unlike the many books I've read recently Slightly Single is defintely not one I will share with my girlfriends.The book really brought me down. Not the funny, feel good, ""chick lit"" I usually enjoy. Very little plot, just day to day in the life of a gal with little self esteem and pined for a guy who had little or no affection for her.I purchased this book because I received Wendy Markham's Slightly Settled as a gift and wanted to read Slightly Single first. I certainly hope Slighty Settled is a better read."
4,Easy Summer Read,"As a commuter I need something to keep my attention on my 1 hour train ride. This book did the trick! I'm certainly looking forward to the ""Slight..."" books to follow!"
4,Cute story.,"A quick one day read, totally Bridget Jones Diaryesque but I love BJD. Althought, I enjoyed this book I wish it had ended differently."
2,Slightly Stupid,"I started reading this book hoping the main character would actually progress. However, despite ensuing tribulations and experiences she doesn't seem to accept the lessons life gives her and stubbornly clings to her obsession. At some point, I just felt like slapping her. I believe she took a couple of positive steps in the right direction but never really got the point. Jemima J is way better."
2,"""Whine"" anyone?","I usually love Wendy Markham's novels but this one is on the bottom of my list. The constant whining the main character Tracey did about her boyfriend throughout the whole book just grated on my nerves. The book also lacks a good ending and after actually reading the ending, I got mad at myself for actually reading the book all the way through. I should have stopped after the 3rd or hundreth time she whined about her boyfriend. Just hoping the book would get better at some point made me want to finish reading it. Was I ever wrong."
3,Slightly Pathetic,"I liked this book well enough as I was reading it, but the main character came across as very weak and unlikeable through most of the book, especially in regards to her actor boyfriend who never seemed to show an ounce of boyfriend behavior. Overall an okay read, but not stellar."
2,Good except the end,I found this book to be very engaging until the end. It was as if there was no real end - didn't seem to wrap up resolve issues like normal book endings do. I was disappointed about that - but it held my interest up until that point.
2,WARNING! Typical romance book with no sense of realism.,"Don't be fooled by the higher price and the cool-looking cover. This is simply a contemporary romance novel. It's cliche and offensive to strong-willed women -- even those, like an Ally McBeal, who are a little over-romantic. You can have romance and humor -- but not with this rehashed Red Dress Ink series. I think I am dumber for having read this book. I'm definitely dumber for not having noticed that it's a Red Dress Ink book."
2,really average,"Although this book is completely acceptable as a light summer read, it just never got off the ground for me. The main character, Tracey, was such a weak person...pandering to her jerk boyfriends every needs and starving herself to be thin. Her best friend is such a stereotypical drag queen that it makes me wonder if the authour as ever met a gay man in her life.Even if a character has faults, I like the writing to be capable and their voice to be somewhat original. This girl was so weak and insecure that I couldn't find any real empathy for her and I couldn't help but feel I was reading someones junior high attempt at journaling.If you want a good summer read in this vein try Confessions Of A Shopoholic or Backpack or How To Be Good."
1,Major Disappointment,"Buying this book, I knew that it would have no literary value but I wanted something to read during my beach vacation. Something that would not make me think and relax, just have fun..But I realized while reading this book that it got boring (maybe because this was my 5th chick book). It was the same story over and over. Only I totally disliked Wendy Markham's main character. I mean, my God! Please all single females out there.. Please have some spine. Do not, and I beg you, please do not associate yourselves with this pitiful character. Women need to read better novels with some stronger female characters. Even during a beach vacation.I disliked this book. I disliked the way she portrayed the single woman and it is even more disappointing to come here and read some reviews ""All single women should read this book..""I did not relate to this character at all. I was hurt too during relationships. But thank God, I do not think I ever let myself get this low."
4,Enjoyable,"Another novel about a 20-something single woman living in NYC...or is it? This story follows the life of Tracey Spadolini as she tries to recreate herself in order to win back a philandering boyfriend. Very similar to Bridget Jones, but with a slightly different spin. I really enjoyed this light reading."
4,Slightly Superb,"Slightly Single is great :) I enjoyed every page of this book! Like some of the other reviewers of Slightly Single have stated, I really related to this book's main character and the emotional baggage she carries around from a hideous boyfriend. Every woman, at some point in their lives, has had one. The man they thought the sun and moon rose & set over, who didn't care what happened to her as long as she still adored him. Other than just relating to the novel though, it's just a darn good read! I was amused at the shenanigans the main character Tracey kept getting herself into, and also I love that the novel doesn't end with a sappy fairytale ending where everyone is happy and blissful and fake (don't worry, I'm not giving anything away here!!) So if you're a 20 or 30 something woman looking for an entertaining novel to pass the time on a bus, train, vacation, or whatever, you'll like this book. It's a quick read that's funny. What more could you ask for?"
3,"Dissapointing,but still THE BLUE MEANIES","Yeah,I was kinda dissapointed with this album.The blue meanies are a great band but just don't make it on this live album.It is very long and you tend to get kinda tired of listening to song after song when alot of them sound very similar.There are some really great songs,but in a whole it's not that impressive.The blue meanies are a mix of heavy metal,punk,ska,jazz,a little swing,carnival style horn rhythms and there own thing.A really great band,but I suggest you go after their studio albums instead of this live one."
5,Terrific sunglasses with unbeatable warranty,I bought these glasses as a replacement for a pair that I bought for my wife eight years ago that the rubber nose piece fell off of. Then I remembered the excellent warranty and repair policy of Bushnell and send the old old pair in for repair. Bushnell repaired the glasses at no charge other than the five dollar shipping charge. My wife loves the glasses!
1,Tracey under exposed.,"This is a 60 minute waste of time. The picture quality is awful. Tracey Bingham is only in the thing for ten minutes and half of that is talking about herself and the other half she is wading in the ocean. This looks liked it was filmed before she was even on baywatch. I have no ideal who the other ladies are but none of them look like they could even be on baywatch. As far as comparing herself to Pam Anderson is like comparing malt liquor to a fine wine. Dont get me wrong, I think Tracey is a beautiful woman or I would not have bought the dvd. But I think she can do much better than this."

5,Please release this film to The States,"I've only seen this film twice and enjoyed its underdog message. In a double feature, I'd show it with Francis Ford Coppola's TUCKER as a pair of films about dreamers who had the ideas right but were vastly under appreciated and forgotten by time. I can hardly wait until someone deems it okay to release this film to The States."
4,Great Quality,"I purchased 7 of these ties for a skit we were doing at church. I was expecting the price to reflect the quality, but when they came in, I was thoroughly surprised. The ties are extremely nice fitting, and they knot nicely. Many ""cheap"" ties are too thin or too thick. These ties are great."
5,Awesome ring,"Love this ring not too big doesnt take up my whole hand, spins around my finger sometimes little feet get caught on some things but i love it!!!!!"
5,Wrong age group,"I bought this to use with my 2nd grade CCD class, but I'm afraid it may be a bit too advanced for them. It's not something I can read during a classtime. It will probably be a good resource to give me the right language to reach the children on various different subjects. However, I think it is more suitable for children over 8 years old, even though the back cover states it is recommended for ages 8-12. Or maybe as a good reader for a child with his/her parents.I do like that it has a Study Guide in the back with questions for each chapter to prompt further discussion with children."
4,Inova X1,"good flashlight with non adjustable flood beam. Has a good light power for small size. Not a primary source of light, but works well for pocket use."
2,old item,This is good flash light but it is old one modification of X1. It does not much description of X1 on inova.com web-site. I would not buy it again if it will cost more $10-$12.
1,Dont Buy It,"Do not buy this flashlight if you want something practical. The structure is actually great quality, but the on/off switch is trash, horrible, very cumbersome. For quick use you need to keep the very uncomfortable button press while being very careful that you don't move your finger and twist the cap of the switch, and turn the flashlight off or on permanently."
1,So Many Partings,I was disappointed in the condition of the book. I purchased this book as a used book at three times the cost of the original. I was not happy when I received a beat up book. I loved the story.
2,Love the looks - but fell apart!,I love these shoes! Problem is...the button popped off the side and the heel broke as well. The inner gold liner also started coming up. They are super cute though and I got compliments for the two months they lasted.
3,"Great price, great quality but too small","This is a great pair of shoes.They have great quality and the picture make justice to them.I got it for christmast.But there is a problem about the size, these shoes are for skinny feet, they are tooooooo tight.So make sure you buy(at least)1/2 size bigger."
4,Great Pumps!,"I am not someone who likes wearing heels, but these heels are extremely comfortable, especially considering they are 3"" high. I love them so much I bought four pairs in different colors. They are very versatile; they can be worn to work or out on the town. Definitely a great buy!"
4,Steve Madden Women's Luvvy Pump,"I really love steve Madden shoes and these polka dots were too cute to pass up! They are a little on the high side, and you may want to go a half size up to avoid toe cleavage. They get noticed every time I wear them.Steve Madden Women's Luvvy Pump"
2,Size runs REALLY big,"I wear a 9, sometimes a 9.5 shoe, so I figured I could get away with the 9. There was no way this shoe was even close to fitting me. It was adorable, and I really wished I could have worn it, but I ended up just giving them to my friend because they fit her fine. It is a really cute shoe, but I recommend trying them on in a store instead of buying online."
2,Only for Newbies to Captain Beerfart,"This is a retrospective spanning most of Don's career, with some excellent song choices. However, for rabid fans like me who own every released Captain Beefheart recording, this adds no value since except for a single song it's all previously released material.For newbies, or for an overview of all Beefheart's best material, this is the CD to get. But then you'd just end up getting all the other recordings anyway. Grow Fins is for the rabid fan, by the way."
4,Really tastefully done package of a true visionary artist.,This is a great little box set of Captain Beefheart's original work. With a very nicely done booklet that chronicles his rocky career of the avant garde blues world. Truly in a class all by himself. What impresses me the most after listening to him again is 1. what a great vocal stylist he was. 2. The beauty and power of his words and images from dark to light. 3. I am sorry I never got to see him live.
4,"Webcor, Webcor","You really can't go too wrong with two discs full of some obvious Beefheart cuts, as long as you have the mandatory rarities, etc. Still, the focus on the obvious skimps on some pretty indispensable items (Space Age Couple, Her eyes are a blue million miles, Son of Mirror Man, Sho' Nuff, Dr. Dark, Trust Us) while excluding all of his rare extended jams (such as 25th Century Quaker). Oh well, if anybody deserves a completist fan base, it's the dear Captain.Speaking of which, Lick my decals off baby remains the most important disc of music out of circulation, anywhere, while there are a number of folks looking for a pristine release of the original Bat Chain Puller (currently represented by the boot leggy Dust Sucker."
5,An Assortment of Observations,"Good mix of tunes here, although I might quibble over the non-inclusion of ""Dirty Blue Gene"" and a few others. Beefheart sounds both saner and crazier as time goes by; by now lots of musicians have absorbed his innovations. I myself listen less these days to his crazier stuff and more to things like ""Safe as Milk"" and ""Clear Spot."" But the material from ""Trout Mask Replica"" and ""Lick My Decals Off, Baby"" sounds great in this context, as does the later stuff. Someone needs to reissue ""Lick My Decals Off, Baby"" and add on all the tracks from that era that are bound to be languishing somewhere, and do the same with ""Doc at the Radar Station"" and ""Ice Cream for Crow,"" which in fact would make a great twofer a la ""The Spotlight Kid""/""Clear Spot."" For me, Captain Beefheart is easily as important as Hendrix, Miles Davis or the Beatles, and we should be able to get all of his work. But this anthology is a great place to start."
1,"Thought about it, but...","I saw a sample of the book on another web site while searching for something about Ken Kesey. In this book it says Ken Kesey had parties on ""Penny Lane"". Guess they got confused with the Beatles song as it should be ""Perry Lane"". A fact problem or editing problem? Don't know but not wasting my time with it."
2,C - -,"What is C without pointers? I am not sure but it is not C. Someone at work suggested it would be C--. That might be a better title for the book. It might be OK for a very very very beginner but it would probably leave even them hungry. In all fairness it does have 2/3 of one page on pointers. The classic K&R; book on the C language by the people that invented it spends about 20% of the book on pointers.This book mostly skips structures also with a mere 1.5 pages on them. If you combined pointers and structures probably 1/3 of K&R; is on them.I really like the Dummies series. They have a unique feature that is missing in most computer books. You can read them and not fall asleep before the end of one page. I recommend you skip this book and get ""C All-in-One Desk Reference for Dummies"". Also, (not recommended for beginners) the classic ""The C Programming Language"" by Kerningham and Ritche, 1988, is still in print and surprisingly readable."
2,Not much substance....,"The idea behind the Dummies books - put the reader at ease - is taken to extremes here. The style is not only very distracting, but a waste of time. This book is almost 400 pages long, but if you took out the dumb jokes and other irrelevant material, you could condense it down to about 50 pages. For a good introduction to C programming, and an excellent example of concise technical writing, spend fifteen bucks to download Coronado's C tutorial:[...]I have a total of three introductory books on C programming and none of them is as useful as the Coronado tutorial."
4,this book is okay,"I bought a million books before taking a class in C. This was one of them.It seems okay, I guess, but not great. I ended up using the Dietel book for class, which was amazing - although I'm not positive I would have enjoyed it so much without the aid of an instructor.I think the best book I used for learning on my own was by Apress - but I generally like all of their books."
4,Pretty Decent,"This book is good for people who want to learn C, but if your running a Windows Vista (specifically 32 bit) your going to have some problems in setting up the stuff. You might have to run the compiler installations a bit differently. If anyone goes so insane as I did in trying to get past the first chapter on a Vista pc/laptop, this site helped me get through some pc issues: ""http://phy225.dept.shef.ac.uk/mediawiki/index.php/Running_devcpp_under_Vista "" Also helpful if you want to save the trouble of admitting yourself to a mental institute. Regardless, buy the book if you want a good intro to C programming. As far as the first program, somewhat of a pain as he tries to make the popular ""Hello World"" program into something unique."
1,"If you want jokes, buy a joke book","C for Dummies, as with all of the Dummies offerings, is premised on the idea that you have to be fed a laugh on every line in order to learn anything. The fact is a little humor goes a long way and this one goes way too far. This is not to say that the information offered is either bad or lacking but it is hidden in a jungle of low-grade knee-slappers that do nothing to advance the cause. Worse, a first book on a subject like this tends to become the preferred reference source and this is so cluttered with cutesy corn that it will fail to serve the reader.If you really need corn with your lessons, try Kellogs. If you are serious about the subject and want to get the straight skinny, go buy a K&R;."
2,"Not as good as other ""dummies""","The writer has apparantly decided that dummies are idiots. A lot of joking around but no real beef. A good deal of background info which is not really relevent to trying to learn C. More for someone that wants to learn about C, but not the language itself."
5,Well made Philips fiber optic cable,This cable is well made. It is a lot thicker than a regular cable. It is the same size as the more expensive high end Monster cable. It works great with clear sounds.
3,Nice but stone way too small,"I really like the style and feel of this ring.However, the stone is much smaller than in the picture. It's about half the size of an eraser at the end of a pencil. I was disappointed in that."
1,Absurdly misleading,"Now that an actual docudrama is finally out about Carlos, feel free to bypass this cartoonish Rene Cardona attempt at a hybrid terrorist-ninja flick. It has absolutely nada to do with the actual Carlos. If it were at least a decent expenditure of 90 mins. I'd forgive the mis-labeling.... but it's not."
3,Older Book on Yoga,"This book was the first and only book I have ever read on Yoga. Just wanted a copy for my own library. Has some good basics in it. I first read it when I was 20, am now 56. I don't stand on my head anymore! Maybe I should again. I like how the author has explained the benefits of each exercise. Easy instructions to follow."
1,Publication Information,"This essay was published in the SSC REVIEW in 1973 at Shippensburg State College (now Shippensburg University). Reprints might be available from the Shippensburg University Ezra Lehman Memorial Library, Shippensburg, PA 17257.Angelo Costanzo"
2,Very Easy Tests,"I am a student who has seen it all. The fact that there are 5 tests is something good. Explanations are good also, but the problem is the tests are not hard at all and this is why it make a student over confident which is something bad. The test is definitely harder than these tests."
3,Great product!,"I'm using it to connect my pc, laptop, vinyl turntable and cd player on the same sound system and tv. It works great! It's a shame it lacks composite in/out."
5,Small easy to use - perfect,"That device is small, light, easy to use and have a good output.recommended"
1,Video Flicker - SOLVED,"I purchased this item because it was inexpensive and would potentially solve my cable clutter. I ordered, received and installed. Installation was easy, just plugging RCA cables. Everything worked OK (WD TV Live Plus, Wii, DVD Player) that is until the flickering came on. This only happened when the screen was over 90% white screen (like most of the wii menus). Frustrated, I replaced and interchanged all the RCA cables and fiddled with menu options. No luck...until after a bit of research I stumbled upon the words ""Video Bandwidth."" As it turns out these inexpensive switchers can only handle up to 80Mhz, above that they start to output flickering images. So I scoured the internet for component/s-video switchers that supported more than 80Mhz, and I found one (Shinybow SB-5430) that supports up to 100Mhz. It works perfectly now! No flickering whatsoever, and the colors are brighter/crisper. This new switcher works with the Harmony One remote too."
2,"Nice selecter, but remote does not work","I needed this to switch back and forth between my DVD player, satellite dish and PC. I only use it for the audio. Unfortunately, the remote does not work. I contacted RCA and they asked me to send it back to them so they can test it and send me a new one. I suggested they send me a new one first because now that I have it hooked up, I don't want to be without it, and then I could return the defective unit. That was not a solution they wanted to entertain. So now I just select the input manually. Such is life."
1,Doesn't work,"I ordered this switcher due to the fact it came with a remote and I don't have a HDTV and need a $100+ switcher. Starting to think I should have bought a more expensive model. The remote worked fine, but the box would cut the signal in and out intermittently. The signal would also sometimes vibrate. It didn't matter what device was sending the signal. Maybe I got a defective one, but I don't want to hassle with sending multiple switchers back and forth to see if I can get one that works all the time.Hopefully I will get a refund from Beach"
2,"""Unusable Signal""","I don't know if it's my TV or this video selector switch that makes my TV screen black out and display ""Unusable Signal"" during every commercial and sometimes annoyingly through the good parts of a movie, or a show. Otherwise, that said, it doesn't distort the sound or picture."
4,Works well,This product work greats but the remote does not seem to switch on the first push. Eventually it gets around to changing it to where you want.. which beat getting up and pushing the button.lol
3,Works very well but may annoy some users,"Overall this product functions just as advertised but it has a picture quality glitch. If you're viewing a video signal that contains an intensely white background the video image goes haywire. The initial Xbox-360 splash screen does it every time. I first imagined there was something wrong with my Xbox. However, I've since noticed it whenever a video image is as previously described regardless of the source. It does, however, recover quickly and I consider it a minor defect."
2,Signal Not Found,"This worked fine for the first few hours and then the screen flicker with the signal of ""Signal Not Found"" starts to happen. It seems to happen when the screen goes all white or all black, I'm not really sure what triggers it, but it happens often. I returned the first one to Amazon and exchanged it for a 2nd one thinking that maybe the first one was just defective. The second one started the flicker immediately. It happens on all 3 inputs connected and is very annoying. This one will be getting returned too.I can't recommend this product unless that issue get fixed."
5,great input switcher,I use this unit to switch inputs with my universal remote. It works perfectly. I like the front display of the input number. I haven't found occasion to use the scan mode.
4,Good Product,"I bought this video switcher because of the remote feature. Unit was very easy to hook up. Using all 4 inputs it didn't take to long to remember which number controlled which input, (sat. TV, 4; PS2, 2; DVD, 1, ect.) The other switch I had, (manual), had the descrition on the buttons. This remote switch works really well but with one problem, of course it could be my TV. During a scene, when the picture is mostly a very bright white, (mostly during commercials, which is OK anyhow), the video on the TV cuts out and the screen displays the message, ""unusable signal"", until the scene changes, most of the time just for a few seconds. No big problem as far as I am concerned."
2,"Useable, but definitely not the best","This box does what it advertises, but there are others that will do it much better. Video quality definitely suffers when connected to this box."
2,Velcro gets in the way!,The velcro can get in the way and it can be very dangerous if you are working with power tools. I don't recommend this product to anyone.
5,Dansk Dishes - Great Quality,"Although Dansk tableware is now made in Asian countries, the same high-quality product always associated with the Dansk label is still there. I have had Dansk dishware in a vacation rental home for more than 6 years, and there has never been a chip on any of the dishes. For this reason, I just purchased two 16-piece sets of Cafe Blanc for my own daily use."
5,Exception Service,"Before I placed the order, I emailed them with questions. They responded within a very short period of time. I was surprised because I have emailed other vendors and the response time was days. I offered to pay extra for them to gift wrap my purchase for Christmas and he included it in the price. I have been very happy so far and I would certainly do business with them again. Perhaps, this time next year."
1,SkyworthLESS is a better name,"I purchased this TV in March and installed it into my RV - it seemed a perfect solution since it was an AC/DC television. The picture wasn't fabulous, but I wasn't expecting fabulous for the price, it was adequate for the price. But about a month ago I went out and found it dead - power will not come on, I checked the outlet and it's fine, I checked with both the AC and DC power and neither would turn the TV on - it's just DEAD. The TV only has a 90 day warranty, and the company never replied to my repeated emails. DO NOT buy this TV or others from Skyworth - there are many more reputable companies on the market making TV's with at least a 1-year warranty on their TV's. Mine is going out with the next garbage collection - a total waste of money, but not worth having fixed at the purchase price."
1,Bad Experience,I purchased this Skyworth AC/DC TV a little over a year ago for a travel trailer I own. It was turned on for the first time a few months ago and worked fine at first. Now it slowly bleeds the picture to black and will not turn back on. Sometimes if it sits for a day or two I can get about an hour of use before it goes black again. Because it was purchased over a year ago I have no warranty recourse. This is a piece of junk. Stay clear of these units. I have read no good reviews since mine went bad.
2,discs seem to be low quality,"Packaging is as shown but the discs seem to be low quality, while watching movies there are times when the movie goes to a still or has skipping as if disc is damaged"
3,3 fun movies and one Disgusting mistake,Three movies are quite charming and mostly light hearted fun. I'd never seen An Awefully Big Adventure and now wish I could burn it out of my brain. I kept waiting for the humor and romance and should have stopped watching! Who messed up BIG time and included this movie with romantic comedies. Incest?!?!?! Oh and suicide is super funny... Such a disturbing and gross movie. People are free to create whatever they'd like but it should have Never been in a collection with the other movies. May be worth re-buying all the other movies one by one just to not have that one in my house.
4,hugh grant collection of 4 film favorites,This is only 2 movies and then most times only one movie will play. I have yet to play any of the other movies. They don't work.
4,Very Good Mix WIth One Expception,"I bought this thinking I would enjoy it since I love Hugh Grant. I had seen Music and Lyrics, Two Weeks Notice, and Micky Blue Eyes, but had not seen An Awfully Big Adventure. First of all it is a VERY adult movie. Secondly, it pretty much had no point to it. I just kept wondering if the ""child"" in that movie had something wrong with her, and if she was really that stupid. At the end of the movie I was like I have lost brain cells watching this movie. And it wasn't a chick flick at all. Anyway, if you are thinking about buying this set, it's a really good deal, just be warned about the last movie."
2,Not living room ready,"The sound on this machine is a problem (and since it is a Media Center PC, that's a big deal). The first problem with the sound is that they repeatedly advertise this machine as supporting Dolby 5.1 surround sound; however, after hours of scouring the manuals and online help, followed by multiple phone calls to HP tech support, it appears that the machine hardware is not actually capable of emitting 5.1 surround sound. (It does a fine 2.1, but that's not what they're advertising, and that's not what I paid for!) The second problem is that, because the sound is on the motherboard, every time there is a motherboard interrupt, the sound is interrupted. This can get extremely annoying during DVD playback - or any other time you're trying to use it as an actual Media Center. My advice: if you want a Media Center PC, buy one with a Creative Labs Sound Blaster Audigy 2 card - not this one."
3,Hard to rate,"Customer service was excellent, but it is hard to rate the oil filter itself for a tractor. But seemed good."
4,better than the musical film in some ways,"This book has many color pictures from the film. In some ways it's better than the film because it has extended versions of some scenes. It was made before the final cut of the movie. In the Roughhouse Cafe, the scene of Wimpy sitting down at a table with Popeye was supposed to be shown after the song ""Everything Is Food"" had finished. Those characters had helped to sing another song, ""Everybody's Got To Eat."" Before they'd joined each other, Popeye gave the taxman a dime for melancholia and mumbled [about his father, Poopdeck Pappy]! While Popeye told Wimpy his life story, the thugs, Mort, Spike, and Slug had laughed. Wimpy got nervous and moved away from the table. Popeye continued to talk to him. The thugs had teased him and started bullying 3 other customers. Since I'd bought this book before I saw the film, I was surprised when I didn't hear that other song or the cut lines! The movie would have been better if it had been a little longer."
5,GREAT BOOK!,THIS IS A GREAT BOOK FOR ANYONE WHO EITHER OWNS A CHIHUAHUA OR IS THINKING ABOUT OWNING A CHIHUAHUA. IT HAS SO MUCH INFORMATION TO HELP YOU WITH YOU PRESENT OR FUTURE LITTLE DOG! IT HAS HELP ME ALOT!
5,Great Resource All Around,"The Chihuahua Handbook is hands down the best resource available on chihuahuas. Dr. Coile includes the most up-to-date information in the handbook, ranging in subject from veternary medicine and vaccinations, to the best ways to train such a tiny dog, to the best diet to feed your chihuahua. There is also extensive detail about deciding if a chihuahua is right for you and how to select a breeder and puppy, all of which provides everything a prospective chihuahua owner needs to know. There is even a section dedicated to breeding chihuahuas, which no other books on the breed cover. Most importantly, Dr. Coile's writing is lively and engaging, and never dumbed down. The color pictures throughout the book complete the package -- this is an all-around GREAT resource on chihuahuas."
3,"""Alone Again"" is good. The rest is a throw away","I purchased this off the strength of the song ""Alone Again."" I'm happy to own that one song, but I don't care for the rest of the album."
2,...,"Was not as described, if you're selling one bulb put ""bulb"" in the description not ""bulbs"". This could make for a misleading purchase for other buyers"
4,Great if your fish are looking for a snack!,"Not to be bought if you want to hatch ALOT of baby brine shrimp... but great if you want to hatch an occasional snack for your fish or to have around if the power goes out.Nifty, easy to use product."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I was hatching brine shrimp for some fry that I discovered in my tank. I was having good luck with the soda bottle method I saw on youtube and ASSumed that a professional set up would be kick butt. Oh, how wrong I was. The Shrimpery is/was a complete waste of my money and time. If you want great results do a youtube search and build yourself a soda bottle system........................they work best!!!!"
5,Crab Home,I love the size and toys this home has. It is easy to clean with the removable top. I do not use the food dish that came with it. I added a pool. Plenty of room for extras like spare shells and additional toys! It is great!
1,bad idea,Not a good choice for hermit crabs. You are unable to heat it as it is plastic and you can't control humidity due to wire mesh siding. Crabs need heat and humidity to live.
1,Your crabs will not live long in this,"I've kept hermit crabs for a long time. They can live for decades if their needs are met.This is not a suitable enclosure for hermit crabs. They need high humidity to breathe through their modified gills, non-chlorinated fresh AND salt water in separate bowls, a heater on one side of the enclosure and a cooler area within the enclosure away from the heater so they can regulate their temperature, room to climb for exercise, places to hide from each other, a substrate ( sand, coco-fiber, etc ) several inches deep to molt in, light for day and night,and other crabs for company. I suggest a 10 gallon aquarium tank to start.Please do some research and create a healthy environment for your pets. This isn't it."
2,Disappointing,"The case appears to be made of wood, as described, but the four little decorative pieces (at top, bottom, left and right)are made of cheap plastic. When my clock arrived, the left one was cracked and detached from the clock face. The company it shipped from, Brand Variety, did not list its phone number on the invoice, and the return instructions said that shipping charges were not refundable. I went online and found their phone number and their customer service agent said they would send me a pre-paid return label within 3 days, so perhaps that won't be a problem. The clock is made in China, the movement in Japan. It's really too bad that to save a few pennies, Bulova used cheap plastic and ruined what could otherwise have been a beautiful clock."
2,Not the best Lisa Kleypas book,"I am a major fan of Lisa Kleypas, and like others were disappointed with Suddenly You. I was equally disappointed with Lady Sophia's Lover. The plotline had great possibilities, but the characters were not given enough thought. Sophia fell in love too easily and Ross seemed to only want sex. Speaking of which, I found the sex a little too graphic for my taste. It felt more like a porno read than a romance. I don't mind the sex, it just needs to further the romance, not be gratuitous. I also missed out on my favorite romance plot device - the heroine getting in trouble and the hero rushing in to save. Even the standard plot devices such as the hero getting sick and being nursed and an unexpected pregnancy did nothing to further the romance. Overall, I wish the plot would have been supported by a believable romance, instead of an excuse to write graphic sex scenes. Please leave a little to the imagination! It's why I read them in the first place!"
2,Not as good as it should have been,"OK, so there are enough reviews with the plot, so I won't get too in to detail. Basically Sophia talks Sir Ross into giving her a job so she can make him fall in love with her and then expose him as the horrible person she thinks he is.I was a bit uneasy from the description and it all went downhill. I never felt a connection between Sir Ross and Sophia. She was always playing games and lying. He was always protecting her and forgiving her. He even broke his moral beliefs to help her. COME ON!!! She is too much of a ninny.All in all, I found the plot predictable and not near as good as it should have been. I have read other Kleypas books and loved them. My suggestion is to read one of them or check this out of the library. Don't buy it."
4,WONDERFUL!!!,"A very sensual love story - with the emphasis on LOVE!!The attraction between Sophia and Ross is palpable from page one. Not the usual ""I love you - but also hate you - so I can't let you know I love you"" stuff. I immediately liked both characters and was happy that it didn't take long for them to admit it themselves. Even though Sophia starts out wanting to hurt Ross, she finds herself unable to act on it because of his warmth and kindness. Thus, their relationship begins with mutual respect (and physical attraction) and culminates in true love.I wanted to keep on reading after the book ended. Lisa Kleypas again proved why she's one of my favorites!"
4,justareadernowafan,"I had never read this author before. I have always been interested in Bow Street but hadn't read anything on it in years. The best parts of the book were those pertaining to Nick Gentry. Its always amazing to me how often supporting characters are far more interesting than the main characters. Its as if the authors never read their own work. How the ""heroine"" could be so spineless when her lover said he couldn't nor wouldn't save her brother from the gallows when it was he who was responsible in the first place for what her brother turned into. And then the way he treated her brother. They both made me sick. I hope the author writes her next book about Nick. That should be very interesting if the author doesn't blow it (skip the love story)."
2,Kleypas loosing her touch...,"THis book like her most recent books lack that ""something"" that makes a romance reader cry, laugh, and basically go through all the tortures along with its characters. This new book by kleypas was mildly warm! I had trouble finishing it. Why? There was no mystery and no passion that can be detected in the book. The characters relationship was lukewarm and predictable. Also, there was nothing gut wrenching at all about the characters. If you want the best kleypas book, read ""Dreaming of you"" and you'll crying throughout the book.This book was just plain trite! Also, the sex scenes were terrible, I actually yawned when they were ""doing it"". Boring!"
2,Major Disappointment,"Lis Kleypas has been a favorite author...one I would buy without reviewing. Something has happpened to romance writers...like her ,there is no more building of characters, story line...it is all about gratuitous sex...from page one. I have been a fan of Lisa's and have read all her books. She too, should go back and read some of her greats and remember character, story and romance is the bedrock of good romantic novels."
3,Not my favorite of Kleyas novels,"While this novel was not my favorite, its worth it if you love mysteries. I just was not intrigued with the story line, but was pleased that it still took place in England. Not bad, but not the best."
1,Suddenly You was better.,"This book was not as well written or developed as ""Suddenly You."" The characters were unsympathetic.Why did the heroine gratuitously have a previous lover, who was a loser? It didn't help the storyline or the characters' development. Only made the heroine seem stupid and naive."
3,Extremely Predictable - Formula to the last word,"If you like romance books, all kinds... this is an ok read. Lisa Kleypas writes inviting characters and you find yourself caring, regardless of the predictability of the story line. In this particular story, Sophia takes a job for the local magistrate to ruin him, tempt him into love with her and break his heart for a wrong she knows he committed years before. He does fall in love, but so does she. I don't want to spoil anything in this book, but should point out that when I reached the storyline portion that would be considered a ""spoiler"", I'd long figured it out. There is a set formula that romance books are encouraged to follow. This one followed a little too closely and there just isn't much more than the characters to recommend it."
1,Did not hold my interest,"Usually I love anything by Lisa Klepas, but her most recent book, ""Lady Sophia's Lover"" did not even hold my interest long enough for me to bother finishing the book."
3,Not As Good As It Could Have Been,"Although this author is still one of my favorites, I must admit that this story was not up to her normal standards. It was slow to start and I had a hard time wanting to pick it back up after I had set it down. The story was rather predictable and did bore me like I said earlier. If this is your first time reading Ms. Kleypas don't judge her on this effort alone. She is normally a very talented author."
3,Slow-paced,"Thought this book was a bit slow paced. I read other books by Lisa Kleypas and she seems a bit ""liberal"" with her love-making scenes but I found them to be a little too weird. Was annoyed with myself for purchasing."
4,"Not the greatest, but enjoyable","I didn't find myself surprised, delighted or laughing, but it was still a good read.Sexual content: not evaluated. I read this book before I began counting sex scenes and describing the language. As I recall, it was probably moderate. Setting: About 1839 London. Copyright: 2002. Genre: historical romance.For a list of my reviews of other Lisa Kleypas books, see my 4.5 star review of ""Sugar Daddy"" posted 8/19/08."
3,"For a Kleypas, so so...","A good, but not a very satisfying read.The supposed history behind all the key characters demanded a lot greater depth than LK supplied - I didn't have much belief in either Ross's supposed steely nature, nor his spontaneous infatuation with Sophia, nor did I believe her easy change of heart... nor did I believe that Sophia was instantly recognised, while *she* failed to do likewise.Plus points: Good writing (as ever), 'nice' characters, and a good bit of background to those that make appearances in other titles.If LK hadn't set her own standard so high with the likes of Dreaming of you, Where Dreams Begin, Then Came You etc etc, I would be praising this as way and above a lot of other titles on the market."
4,pleasant,"I have to admit that after reading some negative reviews, I was quite hesitant to buy the book. But I am glad I followed my instinct with Lisa Kleypas. (And it helped that it was my first Bow street book to read because when I later read the prequel, Someone to Watch over me, I didn't like it).The book is easy to read, the story is pleasant, the interaction between the hero and heroine is very enjoyable. All in all, a really nice romance. It's not her best (that would be the Wallflower series and some Hathaways for me) but it's very good, definitely worth reading. And it is a prequel to Worth any Price (Bow Street 3), another good read."
5,I love love LOVE this book!!!,Great novel. This my second time reading it. I love Lisa Kleypas books. Her characters are always interesting and the love scenes are steamy!!! I even got my niece reading Kleypas novels. My goal is to read all of her books. Keep writing Lisa!
5,"Great, but...","I gave this book 5 stars because I love Lisa Kleypas, and she has never let me down.The most notable thing about this book is the sensuality, so if you're not a fan of more graphic love scenes, this may not be the book for you. For the rest of us, this definetly is one of the more ""steamy"" I have encountered.I agree wholeheartedly with all of the other reviewers' praises, but with only two additions. First, I actually thought the hero was a tad too perfect. On one hand I found myself thinking ""wow, what a great guy,"" but at times his noble perfection grated on my nerves just a TINY bit. And, as this is part of a set, I'd have to recommend ""Someone to Watchover me"" and ""Worth Any Price"" over this one...I LOVED those! Still, this is worth a read."
2,Not Her Best,"The premise of this story was great..but after couple of chapters, I found myself bored, thus skimming looking for any of the usually excellent qualities that lead me to instantly purchase a Kleypas book--dialogue, sympathetic h/h etc etc... I was greatly disappointed..and sad. I am crossing my fingers that the next book will be better!"
4,Another good book from Kleypas,"I am really enjoying books by Lisa Kleypas. This one does not disappoint either. Has a good set up, heroine plans on taking revenge on hero by making him fall in love with her and then destroying him. It wasn't a great book, but a good one that I would recommend. My only complaint is that Ross could have been a bit more ""manly"". He seemed kinda wimpy to me even though he wasn't."
3,So So,"I am a big fan of LK; however, I found her latest novel was rather mediocre. It lacked creativity and was predictable. I usually enjoy all her books and I hope her next one lives up to her past novels."
4,Another excellent Kleypas read,"Unlike the meandering tone of many Regency romances, Kleypas keeps true to her characters (many of whom reoccur throughout her books)and their mileau, wihout excessive decriptives and dialogue about fripperies! This is a wholly satisfying book, that you'll want to read in one sitting. It is better, in fact, than the preceding novel that links to it (Someone To Watch Over Me) - and you don't need to read one to read the other, though I'd certainly recommend both."
2,But her other books are so good. . .,"Lisa Kleypas is generally an excellent writer with well developed characters and excellent plot. Unfortunately, here that is not the case. Sophia is annoyning in so many ways, she had TSTL syndrome- To Stupid to Live. Plus no backbone. With Ross, I'm still trying to figure out what his good qualities were, all he seemed to do was tell Sophia how she was wrong and he was right. I highly recommend reading Worth Any Price or Someone to Watch Over me, both are excellent books. Try those to discover what a wonderful writer Lisa Kleypas."
2,Is she loosing her touch?,"I've read two books by Lisa Kleypas (Suddenly You, Where Dreams Begin) and I loved them. But this one was flat and boring in comparison. The characters were unsympathetic, the plot predictable. Even the love scenes were boring. And I'm not complaining about ""gratuitous sex"", it's just that they made me yawn!Besides, it started to disappoint me since the first pages. I don't like when the hero or the heroine feel that ""incredibly urgent passion"" since the very first page. Some authors can make it believable, but this is not the case.It seemed that the author ""had"" to write a sensual novel, but felt no enthusiasm or inspiration.In the overall, it's not that bad, so if you're looking for a ""relaxing read"" this book could be a good choice.But there's such a large quantity of romances out there, you could save your money for something better..."
4,steamy,"Lady Sophia's Lover is steamier than the usual historical romance (though not nearly in the league of Lisa Valdez'sPassion--more on the level of Emma Holly's historicals).The heroine gets a job as a magistrate's assistant, planning to destroy him for indirectly causing her brother's death, by, among other things, making him fall in love with her and then breaking his heart.Well, we all know plans like that are doomed to fail.A couple of cute twists makes this even more entertaining.All in all, a good read."
4,solid historical romance,"A good, consistent, solid romance from acclaimed author Lisa Kleypas. Similar to her current work, good sex scenes with dramatic plot and spicy dialogue. A recommended read."
4,Good....,"The characters in this novel were first-rate. For the most part I liked the story, yet it did get tedious at times. Ross was a great hero; the kind of man most women would love to marry. He seemed to have it all - looks, charm, intelligence, an extraordinary amount of compassion, and even a few imperfections of his own. Sophia was a very lucky woman."
2,be wary of size description,"Be careful of size description here - listed as .1 oz. jars when clearly the jar itself says .01 ounce. That is a HUGE difference. Shop around - you can find saffron from several retailers for $85-$95 per ounce, thus making this .03 total ounces valued at $2.70. I know this is an awesome spice at a ridiculous price (no matter where you order it from), but a diligent consumer will save alot. It will also be beneficial to learn what to look for in high quality saffron vs. low quality. Happy surfing!"
5,This Is Sooo Kool!!!!!!!!!!,This Single gots a little something it gose from 3 minutes to 8 then to 14 minutes and its all Scrambled With the songs from the Party Album.Not Bad At All
5,Best Pick EVER!,"I've been an active musician for 15+ years and have used just about every pick possible and there is absolutely no better pick. Not sure why the other reviewer gave this pick a 2 star rating, I'd give it 6 out of 5 stars if I could. I've never dropped one and I have yet to break one. AMAZING."
2,The Curve,"The pick, because of the indentation plays like it is curved (like the ones I leave in my pockets when I do the wash, from the dryer). I am not accustomed to it, but maybe will get used to it. Maybe it's just me.The design is cool though."
5,Really good step-by-step overview,This book was a very good step by step overview of this product. I had never installed WebSphere before and this book really filled in the blanks.
2,Some Boring Implied,"This film is largely incoherent and to some degree unwatchable. Case in point - footage is shown from a very early '94 arena gig in Dayton. Not only are no complete performances shown, they don't show more than A FEW SECONDS of any one song (and they're doing choice stuff, like Blatant Doom Trip & My Impression Now). Extremely frustrating. Of course there are gems - Bob tracking Pendulum w/ Greg Demos, and singing (and playing!) a solo Mesh Gear Fox, and some wild footage apparently shot by Mary Lou Lord in '94. But not even the hardest core fan will watch this more than once, and probably not even skim through it too often after that. Stick w. live at the Whiskey & Watch Me Jumpstart when you need your GbV video fix."
2,The Title Says It All...,"First off, I am a hardcore GBV fan and I believe that almost all of their work deserves 5 stars, but this piece is really only worth 2 stars of quality. The title is terribly accurate because you need to be really sloshed to derive much enjoyment from this DVD. Honestly, the last reviewer did a perfect job of telling you what to expect- a few nice bits amongst material not even featuring the band (even if it does keep the lo-fi flag flying). I can only second his motion. A must-have for the rabid fan that needs to see everything- especially if the price is right for you. Watching Pollard strain to hit the notes for Pendulum is pure magic in its lack of flattery."
4,"Love it, but takes time to clean!","The Beautyblender is a great sponge for makeup application, but cleaning it takes time. The Blendercleanser deposits too much soap on the sponge which requires quite a bit of time to rinse clean."
1,Poor Quality,"I've used large blending sponges for many years and the brand I loved is no longer being made, so I searched the internet for a long time to try to find replacements. I thought this brand would work. But as I use it, the sponge disintergrates. I wind up with tiny hot pink specks on my face. Either the ones I ordered are old and already deteriorating or the product is flawed. I would not buy these again. Unfortunately I did not keep the receipt so I will have to eat the cost. I ordered the cleanser too, so hopefully it will be a better product that I can use on other blending sponges."
4,Works good,I have a difficult time blending out my under eye concealer but with the beauty blender I get a flawless blend. It works better for me when it's damp. The cleanser works great for cleaning up the blender and my brushes.
4,Perfect makeup sponge!,"The texture is perfect for makeup, wet or dry. Loved that it is so easy to clean & the blendercleanse works perfectly for the beautyblender & my other makeup brushes. Great product & I'd definitely recommend it to someone else!"
3,Good by no...Anyway,"Katie's voice is great... her depth and clarity are dynamic. Songs on the album are very good. She does justice to an old standard (Wonderful, Merciful Savior).However, I purchased the CD for ""Anyway"" (as noted on the song list... #2)... on the CD it is ""If You Only Knew"" -- not a waste of money, but will have to locate ""Anyway"" (Martina McBride song)... somewhere else."
1,URGENT,I made the payment of the product have 2 months (04/17/2012) and has not received the product!I await the touch of you URGENT!Grateful.
2,Dont buy this DvD,"As mentioned in the other review, this DVD is a real ripoff! 5 of the 14 songs are from ""Andre rieu in tuscany"" and the rest are music videos of andre walking around the european country side. Andre is an amazing conductor and musician, but he is at his best when playing live in front of a huge crowd. I would strongly recommend against buying this particular DVD and would suggest that you buy his live concert ones."
4,Good Construction Box,"First off this item is only 26 inches long not 29 as it states in this add for some reason, Like another reviewer wrote the tool tray doesn't seat right after a few uses and the yellow plastic lids on top fall off the hinges all the time. But besides these things I have had one of these for over a year and have literally loaded it with 50plus pounds of tools with no other problems. I'm a carpenter's apprentice and I can fit long hand saws and even my framing hammer in this thing no problem the only actual serious problem is it's so big I can over load it and not be able to carry it, seriously that's why I'm looking at this add right now I'm looking to buy another one and have two so I can change the weight distribution a bit you know. I can't find em in local hardware stores anymore and really do want another one, and my boss wants one too if I can find 2 of them."
3,Great box for large hand tools - Tray is worthless,"I liked the design because it looked like it would hold a lot of tools and keep them organized. After using it first time I found the tool tray is useless. The tray doesn't seat in the box properly and anything put in the tray ends up in the bottom. As a woodworker, it irritates me when thing don't work properly."
2,its ok,"I got this game thought it would have been longer. i have played on all 3 hard levels and i wanted more at least longer, Decent graphics. Game was short."
3,Not bad,"This game is nothing special, the graphics are quite good but it's one of those games where you don't have much freedom, you just have follow the set path.Good for a cheap game though"
2,Not that Great,"I bought this game thinking that it was going to be similar to a Call of Duty type game and I also bought it for my 9 year old son. After playing this game for 1 week I traded it at my local Gamestop store. You spend so much time trying to dodge the bad guys, selecting the right weapon to use, commanding your squad to move and shoot, controlling a UAB and other misc items that it gets pretty tiresome. I have played many shooting games and this game was more frustrating than fun. If you want to play a good shooting game I'd HIGHLY RECOMMEND Battlefield Bad Company instead. My son loves to play it online. The missions are fun and easy and you get to blow up alot of stuff. If you're still thinking of buying Ghost Recon 2, rent it instead."
3,Unstable game,I am just going to leave a short review. Storyline is just average. Game play takes some getting use to since you have to control other soldiers/vehicles.I would have rated this game a little higher if it wasn't for the fact that the game constantly crashes. I would have to quit the game at least every other checkpoint. Needless to say this was pretty frustrating. This is not the fault of my PS3 since I have played many other games without any problems. There doesn't seem to be a way to patch this game; maybe I just couldn't find it.
4,Online is best part!,"The game itself is good. I like the fact that you get to control your men in the campaign, and you have a very very very very very wide variety of guns, which comes in handy online and in the 4-player multiplayer part of the game. The controls are a little funky at first, but they get easier as time passes. Since ""Future Soldier"" is coming out soon, it may not be as popular, but I would recommend this game to everyone who has online, because the online gameplay is smooth and very fun!"
3,"Single player great, Online a bust.",I'm not as much into tactical shooters but I had some real fun with this game. However I could never get online with it. I've never had a problem with any other PS3 game. With this one all I ever got were 'Network Service Errors'. I have my router set up just right (PS3 in DMZ) and I even tried forwarding the ports they list in the manual but no luck. I couldn't find any answers or support online. Very frustrating.
4,Good for Customer service and Personal Management.,Good for Customer service and Personal Management. Very well structured and easy to read. Great from an interpersonal and communication standpoint. Will really help with customer relations. Good insight into managing stress.
5,Outsatnding book on customer service,"If you want your organization to rise above the competition when it comes to delivering great customer service, I recommend that you read this book and apply the principles within it."
3,I gave the book away,This book was a gift/educational tool for employees at my work. I did not read the book so I am giving it an average rating.
3,lot of noises.....but not a great noise!,its ok but not the killer unit the hype says it is....a lot of unusable tones....I can live without it....
3,FUN PEDAL,"THIS IS A FUN PEDAL. I BOUGHT THE BASS SYNTH WAH TO USE WITH MY HOME COMPUTER RECORDING SETUP. I ONLY GAVE IT A THREE BECAUSE THERE ONLY A COUPLE OF SOUNDS THAT APPEAL TO ME FOR MY BASS. I PLAY MOSTLY FUNK AND BLUES-ROCK.THE OCTAVE SETTING SOUNDS PRETTY COOL. IT CAN BE SET TO WAH WITH THIS EFFECT. SOME OF THE SYNTH SOUNDS ON LOW INTENSITY ARE ALSO COOL. THE PEDAL IS WELL MADE AND SOUNDS GOOD. SOMEONE WHO IS MORE INTO USING BASS EFFECTS WOULD LIKE THIS. ALSO IT WORKS BEST IF YOU CAN BI-AMP, SENDING THE EFFECT TO THE HIGH END AND KEEPING THE LOWS CLEAN. GOOD DEAL FOR THE PRICE."
4,Year 3 and counting!,"This is my third year using this product and I am very pleased with it. If you donate throughout the year and keep track as you go, this will be a great help to you. I could never figure out just how much to claim for things. This program clears up most of it. I don't understand all the people having trouble using the program. It works great for me!"
1,Not worth the time,"This product has a number of bugs and causes a lot of problems with Windows. It is not worth what you save. There is a promise that they will refund your money if you don't save $300. I saved $288 with the product, and they told me they can only give refunds within 60 days of purchase. This does not work if you want to use the product for contributions throughout the year, since you don't find out how much you save until you do your tax return at the end of the year. This ""guarantee"" is a joke."
1,"Its Not Deductible, Its Awful!","What a joke! This software is far from ready for primetime. I have uncovered numerous bugs and spent hours with Intuit's terrible tech support. I've had to make 4 phone calls, each requiring 1 hr + just to get connected with a person and then we spent about an hour or so trying to debug this mess. Stay far away from this piece of junk! If you make a mistake and buy it, do not under any circumstances, allow the software to update. Each occurrence resulted in a laborious call to tech support."
2,Great hype then fizzles out,"I used the 2005 version all year and was thrilled at how easy it was and the huge tax savings (since I take many bags of donations throughout the year). It was quite a let down to discover at tax filing time that it did NOT transfer to Turbo Tax as indicated. Intuit also has absolutely the worst customer service (oxymoron) imaginable. They only send canned responses and never actually address your concerns.The 2006 version does not exist, even though it is advertised as being available on line. After numerous attempts to purchase it and contacting them to do so, I gave up and ordered H & R Block's version."
4,Simple and Effective,"In the past, I always estimated my own dollar value for donations. This software was so cheap that I decided to give it a try. I've used it for two years now. The software is ok. The user interface could be easier. Bottom line, I am able to deduct much more $ on my taxes. My estimates were always too conservative. There hasn't been an upload from this software to TaxCut (which I use). This year I'm going to try Deduction Pro which does export directly to TaxCut.This product helped me save money and more than paid for the cost."
1,Intuit took a great product and ruined it,"Intuit, what did you do? It's Deductable >>used to be<< a jewel of a program - fast, effective, great support, and cheap. After ""upgrading"" to the 2003 version, it is now filled with awkward interface, missing categories, and buggy -- plus to add insult to injury, the valuations on the items, which previously were guaranteed to pass audit, are now >>lower<<. BAD MOVE! My recommendation is to buy the book and keep your own records, this program is no longer worth the $$."
1,nice concept if it worked,"I bought this program to organize and simplify my charitable giving. Unfortunately even though I have a new Dell computer,which works well, this program does not.The program is supposed to list the market values of all items given to charity. In theory, you can then use these market values in determining the value of your charitable deductions.Unfortunately, my program would not allow me access to these market values. I have loaded the program twice, and have even got the update on the web, to no avail. It would be nice if the product worked out of the box. It does not."
2,Poof! 2003 Vanishes on April 14,"2nd year I've used it. It has saved me a lot of money but I am looking a competitor in 2004.After relgiously entering and tracking a ton of donations during 2003, just before I was about to export to TurboTax, there was a glitch and the software decided that I hadn't purchased 2003. I had to rekey every donation item (sometimes over 100 items in a single donation) for 2003.We were able to get the rights back but the data had vaporized. No explanation was available. I've been a big supporter and have recommended it to over a dozen friends. Not anymore."
1,False Advertising,"The product literature states:""Provides you with an Exclusive Kelley Blue Book Car Donation Estimator - allowing you to assign accurate valuations even to your car donations so you can be sure you are getting the full deduction you deserve.""It doesn't. I contacted product support and was told that an update would be released later. He couldn't give me a date. You really shouldn't advertise what you don't provide. I will now be using TaxAct instead of TurboTax."
1,Pass on the software; buy the hard-copy version,"I like the concept and have used the hard copy for several years. Last year, I bought the software -- much to my regret.There a glitch that made the program inaccessible after January 1 (when ELSE does one do one's taxes?) and though there was a patch, it took FOREVER to get through to Tech Support.In addition, you can't use the program for more than one year. Though the program (and book) come with a guarantee in case you're audited, the choice of using the data for a second year -- and foregoing the guarantee -- should be MY choice, not that of a program.Good data, but get the hard-copy version and build and Excel spread sheet for your records."
3,Not Worth The Hassle,"I love just about anything put out by Intuit and have used Quicken and TurboTax for years. I tried Its Deductible last year and initially was pretty impressed because I didn't know I was entitled to claim that much for donations. However, after all my hard work inputting all my donations, when it came time to file my taxes, there was a glitch with I.D. and it would not create a report, integrate into TurboTax or anything. I spent THREE DAYS trying to get through to customer service to get it fixed. After a whole lot of waiting and a whole lot of poor customer service, I finally gave up and was unable to use I.D. with my tax return. I was very disappointed with how difficult it was to get through to customer service. Plus once I finally did get through to someone (3 days later) they were unable to fix the problem."
2,Poor interface design,"This will save you money because it has a table of values based on item values in a thrift store. Unless you already know what those prices would be, it will be worth the $ for this software IF you have enough stuff that you are donating.Three years ago I used this and judging from the comments here, the user interface has not improved one bit. I have been using computers since 1992, so I'm no noobie; but the bottom line is, if you can fugure out the inane logic of this program, it will be useful to you.As for ease-of-use of this software ever getting any better, forget it--why would a beaurocracy care about that as long as people are buying it? I tried to get help with questions and problems when I used this 3 years ago, and the help you get (if you get any) is useless. Another corporation who doesn't care about their customers."
4,"Excellent Product, Saves You $$$","Like most people, I've historically undervalued charitable contributions on my tax return. This software dramatically increased my deduction as compared with prior years (in which donations of things like clothing, toys and household goods were substantially similar). There's little doubt this software will save most taxpayers many-fold the cost of acquisition. I'm a believer, and will keep using It's Deductible!"
2,Didn't do what I expected,"I thought that this program would be like TurboTax, in the sense that I thought it would make suggestions on how I could change my charitable giving to save even more on my taxes.However, it isn't much more than a glorified way to keep track of your giving -- which you could do in a spreadsheet program or Quicken or even by saving receipts.The only thing I really learned from the program is that you can deduct the mileage for your trips to donate non-cash items. Other than that, my guesses as to ""fair market value"" for my donated items were pretty much right in line with what It's Deductible suggested. All that keying in ... and not much difference in the bottom line.Moral? Don't spend the $20 on this one. Buy a really nice calculator instead to add up the value of all your items."
1,"Simplifies bookkeeping, but no real substance","The program does produce a nice report, and it does import into TurboTax but it's database is pretty spartan. (Re: the import glitch: you need to close It's Deductible first, otherwise there's a file access conflict) The Jan 1st ""glitch"" is intentional -- the software is only good for one tax year. Don't buy this now thinking you can itemize last year donations and track this year's donations, too.Database issues: You need the Deluxe version ($10 more) to download computer and electronics values (this is despite the example on the box saying 'computer monitor.' There was no 'kitchen chair,' no Barbie items (but Bionicles toys were specifically listed). I ended up building my own items and values.I expected more from Intuit. I went to the support page to see about the refund (no $300 reduction here) but the entire page is under reconstruction. I'll update this review regarding success of refund attempt."
1,Don't waste your money or your patience,"ItsDeductible *might* save you some money, if the installer would work properly.Tech support is also worse than useless. The chat can't provide any help at all and the *real* tech support costs another $20.Save your money on this. Buy the book and use Excel instead."
1,wrong years,it only was for some past years not any help to me at allthats all I got to say about this I am just adding words to make up the twenty word count needed
1,Its Deductible for 2003,"I am using Turbo Tax and was suckered into downloading this program to estimate my non-cash donations to charity. It sounded GREAT, but it did not install properly. I went to the Intuit website for help -- don't bother to do that!!! After a couple of hours on the phone (the website was useless!), I was promised a refund of the $ 19.95 charged to my credit card. I have my fingers crossed on that! They could not figure out what the problem was! -- I am going to try to use it from a CD from Amazon.com!"
4,Loved Ardas,"I love the soothing and comforting ""Ardas"", especially because I love harp music and devotional music. I don't care as much for side two because it has a little more discordant sounds at times (which means that others may like it even better than side one). But side one still makes the CD worth it for me. If you like this, you will absolutely love Celtic Christmas, also by Kim Robertson. Now THAT is one of the most beautiful CD's I've ever heard. I listen to it year round and used it for my daughter as a bedtime tape when she was younger."
5,Heavenly!,"I first heard this music over 20 yrs. ago in a yoga class and I fell in love with it. I have now replaced the old tape with this CD. This has to be my favorite music to listen to to get into a meditative, calm state. Robertson's celtic harp and Kaur's angelic voice blend together to produce a beautiful harmony that will continue to ""play"" in your head for hours after hearing it."
2,Beautiful But Boring,This recording starts out to be very beautiful and soothing. But it is repetitive and is therefore quite boring after about 10 minutes.
4,"not a smut film, but a smart film that.......","...tackles the life of a single woman who seems to have an overwhelming sex desire until it ruins her. She find love, finally, but she finds out too late that not only love makes your world wonderful, too much love kills too. I had to admit that I thought this would be those kind of films where you only cares about the undressing scenes and how many times copulations take place in the name of art or some avant-garde erotica nonsense, but this movie is more than skin deep.Interesting perspective regarding the subject of love and desire. Great storyline and a taboo issue done with careful respect."
4,Better than you thought!,"This is a very good exploration of the triggers for domestic violence, the impact of domestic violence, and the sequelae of domestic violence. For those not so timid, it is a good exploration of the topic of women's sexuality and how it can intimidate those not prepared to experience a woman as more than a receptacle or vessel and an equal in the sexual experience."
3,An Erotic Love Story with a Message for Men,Not as hard core as I'd like as a man. The hardships of being human is the message I received. The quality of the production is excellent.
2,Really dull,"Not much to recommend here, at least for me. I just couldn't get into the story at all. It just plods along without any meaning."
2,Oedipus in space,"The plot deals with humans' lack of concern for other species and worlds. It deals with the rape of worlds much like we're doing to Earth. The author deals with the main characters sexual problems with seemed to me more of an excuse to get a lot of sex scenes in. I like the alien characters he portrays. You wish our race could be more like them. He gives the aliens the more humane traits and the humans the more self-serving traits. The author seems to be trying to say a lot about the environment and human nature, but nothing that hasn't already been beaten into the ground it the stereotypical fashion. I liked the premise of the plot, but the main character sexual hang-ups distracted me. The story ended weakly with you wishing for the alternative ending, especially as the humans were cast as the evil character."
2,"Disturbing commentary, borderline pornographic","ACTS OF CONSCIENCE has an obvious message that is basically hammered into the reader at every opportunity. Certainly, no mystery there. Does it resonate? Well, not really. The sexual content reinforces the theme, but in a distasteful way. Obviously, that distaste is intended, but it is so blatant that the message becomes muted. Not exactly a bad novel, but not great either."
5,ONE WAS BROKEN,THESE ARE EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. I AM UNHAPPY THAT ONE WAS BROKEN. THEY WERE NOT PACKAGED VERY WELL.ASKED FOR A REPLACEMENT STILL WAITNG TO HEAR FROM SHIPPER.
1,Looking for new bowls; finish damaged in dishwasher,"These do chip as any stoneware item would, but what irritates me is that the finish turns blotchy when washed in a dishwasher. If you handwash your dishes you will be fine."
3,item arrived damaged,"The bowls were just what I was expecting, the only problem I had was 1 of the 4 arrived broken in half due due to the packaging."
4,I like these!,"I like these bowls to go with my Sango Nova Brown dinnerware set. They are the perfect size for my kids, or for stir fry/curry. They aren't a perfect match and seem more delicate with the rest of the set, but they are great for the price!"
2,You get what you pay for,"These bowls were purchased for my kids, they are perfect size wise and they look pretty but they are pretty cheap and one didn't even last a week before it broke in the sink. I am sure that the set will not last the year but for 10 bucks you cant expect a lot."
5,Great bowls......,"Great bowls......Sango Nova Black Ice Cream Bowls, Set of 4.......very heavy good size...I do wish they came in more color options....I bought three sets!~"
5,These are the best ice cream bowls ever!!!!!,"I can't believe how cheap these were, but how well they were actually made, I loved them so much that I bought 3 more sets, the are just the perfect ice cream bowl....I love them! :)"
4,Cute little bowls!,I just love these cute little bowls!I agree with others that Sango overall quality has gone downhill somewhat. But for low cost dishes that look super cute I'm still a fan.I have had some chipping but only when I have knocked them hard or they got really banged around in the dishwasher (husbands shouldn't load dishwashers!)
3,Pretty & a great size but crack easily,"These bowls are pretty and a great size. They come in a great variety of colors. I purchased the brown but the avocado and black are also stunning.The downside is that they crack easily. My family uses these bowls daily and within the six months they have almost all of the 8 bowls I originally purchased have broken.Something to consider, I ordered these from another retail store that was offering them buy-one-get-one free. These were orderd with other dishes. My packaged arrived with several broken pieces. It is possible that these sustained fractures that grew with use."
4,Head's up -these are made in China,If it matters to you where things are made-I might avoid them. Since the product description did not make it obvious these were imported my guard was down. I thought Sango was Japanese. I like the bowls but I am going to have them tested for lead before I decide whether to keep them or not.
4,Beautiful but NOT in any way green :(,"These are beautiful bowl, perfect for ice cream.. However the color scheme shown here is not at all what i received... The brown on the outside is more of a stylish brown not single toned and lighter/brighter.... very nice look... The inside is just a light brown tan-ish color again not single colored... but very stylish... but not the avacado (green) look thats in the picture ... so FYIVery nice bowls... Especially at the current cost of less than $1.30 a bowl"
5,"Stylish, high-quality set for everyday use","I LOVE LOVE LOVE this set. Is it possible to be this excited about simple bowls? Oh, yeah! They are stylish (many compliments from guests), inexpensive, durable (they've been dropped on our granite countertops and have survived without any scratches, chips, or breaks, even after more than a year). We use them for soup, pasta, cereal, microwaving, and--of course--ice cream. We use them for everyday serving and for special occasions, so they're versatile."
5,Wow! Vapor Lock Problem Solved,I had vapor lock issues after the engine ran for awhile and then after being off for 10 - 15 minutes it wouldn't run right. The fuel line was too close to the headers. After using the HeatShield end of problems! Amazing results for such as small price!
3,Ho Hum,"Flops around a bit under energetic motion.Nice snug fit over Walkman.Unfortunately, Sony hasn't taken the trouble to ensure that CD controls are accessible when speaker cable is plugged in. Duh. Utterly imbecilic. Otherwise, it's a nice little case."
4,Useful And Attractive,"This is a very handy item. This case and the Sony D-EJ011 are a perfect match. I personally don't care for the waist strap though, because when your cd player is playing and it is not flat and level, there is more wear and tear on the player. Also battery life is shortened. Although today's players are able to play on their sides in a case without skipping, I'll pass on that. But it's a wonderful case that improves the look of your player and offer some protection. I removed the waist strap and use a wrist strap instead. Works fine."
1,"Probably good software, if it could be used.","Got the software three weeks ago, but still can't use it -- the required ""manual update"" will not be available until after February 20, just about three short weeks before the corporate filing deadline of March 15. Frankly, I'm staggered by the contempt that Intuit displays towards its business customers. Anyone know of a better package for next year?"
1,Your killing me!,"In my opinion, I'm sorry to say, TurboTax Business is about as useless as you can get. During the last three years I've used it and the same deficiencies continue with more being added ""every day"".The most disturbing deficiency is when errors are found during the review. First of all these errors are simple reconciliations of two lines in the return. The software performs the math and numbers are entered through worksheets. However, when the review finds a reconciliation error, all the software says is something like ""line 6 on form x is not equal to line 9 on form y"". When you search for help, all it says is ""line 6 on form x must equal to line 9 on form y"", and that's all. To resolve the problem I've had to read the appropriate pubs, instructions, and forms myself.Also, the itemization of the deduction isn't much better than paper and pencil. To use the software you need to know more than the software.Great, thanks for nothing!"
1,Incorrect movie,This was not the movie I ordered. The seller made a mistake. He did then send me the correct movie although I ordered a DVD and received a VHS tape.
2,Try surfing Palestrina,"Only on the Willi Willi - Groove Salad sequence does Liv Khalsa's ""Liv & Let Liv"" group deliver as futuristic surf music from the Moons of Jupiter, & that largely through the subtle, persistant fretless bass of Ken Simmons. The problems are two: First, Groove Salad ought to provide the penultimate high rather than than the peak. Second, Pachelbel's Canon is weak thematic material when mined for its chord changes rather than the canonic structure that creates the pretty harmonies. Add some Steve Roach, Steve Reich, Dick Dale, King Bennie Nawahi, Ennio Morricone & you might get a great mix. But I really expected more from the concept. Try surfing Palestrina. Or Handel's Water Music.Bob Rixon"
1,Picture in the ad is a misrepresentation of the actual product..,"Length:: 0:05 MinsMisrepresentation;The cable on the left is the one shown in the add.The cable on the right is the one I received in my order.They sat a picture is worth a million word, I think this one really is."
5,So far very happy,"This camera does exactly what I needed, it can see a pretty wide area, has a cool little design that is hard to tell what it is unless you can see the lense... colors seem good, night works good... 5 star"
3,You get what you pay for......,"I agree with Greg in Nashville. Everything seems just too bright & peachey for me to believe that a lot of these reviews are written by company reps. While I do like the camera... , the resolution is very good (not great) during the day, the night vision isn't that good. Also, I don't know how these people are recording with this camera (motion or otherwise). I tried it on two different systems including my new Zmodo 8- Channel DVR and can't record with it. I can take still shots but again, can't record. Other than that...., it's a nice little camera for the price. Remember people...., you get what you pay for....... :-)Jim from Saratoga Springs, New York"
3,"Ok, security camera",The video images is clear during daylight. Night images is hard to see unless something is within a few feet from the camera.
2,Impossible to adjust,"Here I have the camera on the box because we could not adjust the angle of the lens. It's way too hard, seems like it's stuck. I asked the seller for help and offered me a refund, which is not useful for me because I live in Costa Rica and would have to pay the shipping costs from here. It's very dissapointing that the seller does not offer any help, and the instructions sheet is useless."
4,For the price... Great camera.,Night vision is by far the best compared to the current Zmodo cameras I have. Would recommend and will probably purchase one or two more.
5,how i rated this product,"I chose this rating because it is the best for this product. I liked every thing about it ,it is serving its purpose. I would recommend it to every one who need a camera like this, it is worth it."
4,clear and has a great wide angle lens,"works great adjusting it was slightly difficult but i was able to lock in my angle, night vision was good compared to my other cams"
5,purchased 16 and 15 were great,"15/16 and i belive i was the cause of the one that failed, so i still give 5/5.for the price i can't complain, but if install requires better definition you need a camera priced around $100"
2,Good for Only 1 Year!,"I bought 2 of these little cameras for added protection for my home. Thay worked great for a while but then noticed the LED night vision on both cameras started to get dimmer and dimmer. I now have to leave the lights on at night. These cameras are not much of a ""wide angle"" camera so you will need to install them 3 stories up. These cameras are built well but need some improvment."
4,"Only one problem, the net","We just bought this for my son for his 4th birthday. He has so much fun with it, however the net will not stay on. It is beyond frustrating as I have to keep looping it back through. This product would have got 5 stars, if not for the flimsy net."
5,No issues with the net!,"I bought this for my son's 3rd birthday and he can't get enough of this. I don't know why it's shown twice in Amazon (one for $[...] and one for $[...]) but I got it at Toys'r'Us for $[...] so shop around. There were a lot of folks complaining about the net constantly falling off, but if you loop it on correctly, there is NO ISSUE. You push the net up through the hole and loop it around the ""hook"" and it doesn't go anywhere. Plus the person who said it was too small to fit around, you have to make sure the end with the colored tape is on the bottom. Other than that, my son loves it and I am sure he will be playing with it for a while. Even my 20 month old daughter was having a lot of fun with it, even if she is too short. One thing I didn't know ahead of time was that the base needs to be filled with sand (or maybe water) to weigh it down, but for now, it will be inside until the weather warms up so not a big deal. Great toy and gets the kids away from the TV!!"
3,Magical - but inferior edition,"Updating my earlier review: I just found out this show is available - in a much better transfer (picture/sound) in a DVD-edition called ""JAZZ MASTERS - VINTAGE COLLECTION 1958-1961"". I urge everybody interested in this excellent/exceptional/magical show to check out this edition!!!It also includes the THELONIOUS MONK TRIO performing ""Blue Monk"" - which the present edition mysteriously omits...In addition: An extra disc with additional material, a.o. an excellent performance of ""So What"" by Miles Davis...So my advice is: Avoid this edition - check out the one mentioned above - and enjoy the greatest jazz ever captured by a camera...The standout track is the one with Billie Holiday in her own composition FINE AND MELLOW - one of her last performances. This was also the last time she performed together with her lifelong friend/soulmate/lover Lester Young. When he solos, it's almost as you can see his notes touching her..."
1,an ugly transfer!,"I wonder why this disc is so horrible: the video is unwatchable, the sound is poor... And every time I saw some excerpts of this historical event, at some TV shows, the quality was very good. Do not purchase this item."
1,What Happened in the Transfer?,"Having lived with the VHS version for many years and having used it as an adjunct to my regular jazz teaching routine. I excitedly looked forward to (what I expected to be its great) update into the digital format. Upon receiving the DVD, I sat down to hear it - in what I hoped would be its ultimate form), hit the start button & reeled backed horror. The picture quality was totally degraded, the sound - dreadful - and all I can say is that the manufacturers have done an unspeakable dis-service to one of the great historic and visual masterpieces of jazz history. Avoid the DVD -stick with the VHS until the current producers get their act together."
4,"Fun playing, but hold the vocals","Bold, joyous playing, at times precise, at times reckless, make this a treat to listen to. But be prepared for some weak vocals (by two of the three band members). Lovers of old country are not sticklers for staying on key, and know there's a great deal of expressive power in the deliberate roughness of Bill Monroe. Vern Williams and others. But crooning that goes flat provokes more wincing than dancing. Still--a talented and fun group gets my qualified yeehaw."
5,Hot Club Rocks,"The Hot Club is one of the best bands playing in Austin right now.They are a fantastic live band with great energy. I thought their debutalbum was solid, but not really noteworthy. Their followup album (Tall Tales), however, is really quite spectacular. The song selection is perfect and the production perfectly matches their music. Tall Tales is the next best thing to being there."
5,Great Stuff!!,This worked just like the advertising said it would! I put a couple of drops on the leg of my chair and it hasn't come loose in weeks of use! What a bargain!!!!!!!!
4,"Unique perspective, invaluable for XML business modeling","It may be objected that you shouldn't be doing business modeling directly using XML schemas. But if you need to (and a good example is the National Information Exchange Model, or NIEM -- see [...]), then this book has content you won't find anywhere else, at least not in one place or at this level of exposition.I have used this both to understand NIEM and to critique it, including many new trends, such as Schematron validation for NIEM."
1,"No essence, poorly presented","You can expand relation model whatever you like, as long as you have implementation support. Does not see much value of his model, and the book does a poor job presenting the idea."
1,Poor Ernest!,"It's not often I start a book and not be able to finish it, but here's one that should never have been published. It's a shallow compendium, disguised as a novel, made up of material from many sources relating to Ernest Hemingway's life and the lives of other Parisian expats. Hadley, Gertrude, Alice, Pablo and on and on: they're all here. The author has strung this together into a much too long and (for me, at least) unreadable epic, one in which the figures are made of cardboard and--incredibly, given the inherent interest of the source material--are deadly boring. If you're a Hemingway aficionado, this pseudo-novel is a book to skip; it'll have Ernest rotating furiously in his Ketchum grave."
1,I thought I was the only one!!,"I thought I was the only one who thought this book was terrible. Now I know different. Not only is the book boring, but it is unreadable with Carlile's incorrect use of the omnipotent narrator. Since when can a narrator, any narrator, read thoughts and know feelings of others? I'm not saying that literay rules should not be broken, some of the finest work comes from breaking a few rules, but Carlisle went overboard on this one rendering it dull and not worth reading. Save your time and your money."
1,Horrible Book. I Threw It Away,"What a disgrace to treat Hemingway this way. Put words in his mouth; make up deeds he didn't do, and print it. I threw this book away early on, no one should have to pay for something like this. Poor writing, poor treatment of subject, a farce. I'd rather read a book about how to potty train a ferret than be subjected to idiocy like this. I gave it a one star rating only because there was no minus zero available."
4,Excellent Read!,I have read much about Hemmingway and this author has done justice to his lifestyle. It is very informative about literary Paris in the 20's and 30's. Do remember it is a novel and enjoy!
4,Good deal on a Superman movie set,"I wouldn't say that these are all classic Superman films, but the 2-disc set can be had for a really good price, and is loaded with commentaries and special features."
5,I Love Superman,"It is cool that everything is here on this dvd set. It's very cheap too. Plus, there are a bunch of deleted scenes. I grew up watching Superman IV because my mom recorded it on vhs for me. It was cool to see the deleted scenes for that (especially the Nuclear Man prototype). Now that I'm older, I realize how much stuff went over my head as a kid. Maybe 50%?"
4,A Satisfactory Collection of the Superman Movies,This collection of the four Superman movies is a great answer for the collector who wants all four movies but doesn't want to invest too much money.All of the great scenes are here and have both acceptable sound and picture. We have enjoyed going back and seeing them all again and can recommend them for the family.
3,"TWO GOOD ONES, TWO BAD ONES.","Superman One and Two were swell.Superman Three and Four stink.Suggest you go ala cart. Unless,for this good four-some price,you can fence the losers."
3,Not as good as we thought,We remembered this series being so much better than it was. Guess it didn't stand the test of time. Kids were a little bored with it.
4,Superman,This was a great product and I enjoyed this so much! I'm a big fan! The only thing I wasn't too happy about was that all the movies were in one place If they came in individual slots to keep them from scratching it would be better but besides that I was very satisfied!
5,Superman - 4 Film Favorites,"A great buy for people who don't like to buy only two movies out of a four movie series, no matter how disappointing the other two are. In my opinion movie 1 and 2 are great - movie 3 and 4 are duds. This way you can buy the whole series for the money you would have spent on the first two movies."
4,It's Super!,"All films are the original theatrical releases.Superman is very good. Superman II, Superman III and Superman IV: The Quest For Peace, are not as good, yet they have their moments.My opinion is that Superman II, could have been the best in the series.Whether you are already a Superman fan or new to these films, this is a good purchase.Also, check out, Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut and Superman: Special Edition (with additional footage).Then, after all that, check out, Superman Returns!"
5,Older special effects but Classic and Better than New movie,"Although the special effects are older, they are still great looking considering the movies have been made over 30 years ago. The original version of Superman is substantially superior to the new version. The characters have more depth and charisma and the story is far more interesting partly due to the chemistry and relationship between Clark, Superman, and Lois. I highly recommend it."
5,Great deal for ALL four movies!,"When I picked this up in the store I had to do a double-take. All 4 Superman movies for $9.99? Maybe I was missing something. But no, it really was all 4 movies for just ten bucks!The set is made up of two double-sided DVDs, with one movie on each side. The transfer of the sound and picture seemed fine to me. And there's plenty of bonus stuff here too: documentaries, commentaries, trailers, etc. But it was great to just sit down and watch each film in its entirety, which I haven't done in years.The only reason I can possibly think of for not buying this set, is that maybe there's already another Superman DVD set with even more bonus material or they're planning yet another set soon. But if you aren't a die-hard completist, this set is all you need. And you can't go wrong with the price."
1,"not bad movies, but bad disc","Well we all know the films start well and get progressively worse, but the major problem is that the dvd is poorly manufactured, and one of the films on my dvd will not play completely. Can't get a replacement copy."
3,superman,Everybody know who superman was and even though the films are not the best (bad effects and stories) they are classics.
1,missing items,I ordered the superman dvd set seasons 1 thru 4 . some thing i watched as a child and wanted my children to watch them as well. My ored was only half of what i ordered . it only contained seasons 3 and 4. the shipment was incomplete. I am still in the process of getting the other disc.
2,Kid Fun,"Comic book to screen for the very young and the young at heart - and for the females who enjoy seeing a handsome young man in blue tights and a red cape. I'll show these movies to my grandson when he is about six. Beyond that even he'll probably say the stories are silly, maybe even boring. And the special effects in his day will make Superman's flying in these films seem pedestrian."
1,DO NOT BUY!!,"We ordered 3 of the 4 Film Warner Bros DVDs. Batman Collection, Lethal Weapon Collection and Superman Collection. We opened Lethal Weapon Collection and the 1st movie appeared to be of fair quality and then turned it over to play the 2nd movie and it would just start and stop. We did not even unwrap the other 2 and plan to return them all. I guess it shows once again that you ""get what you pay for""."
3,Will read this soon.,I have not read this yet but will on an upcoming trip. My uncle lived through this era and is mentioned in the book.
5,Holds my engine great!,"I have a 4 cylinder jeep engine and this lift holds it with no issues. I have had the full engine suspended for a few weeks now and the jack hasn't dropped an inch! As with most items from amazon that ship frieght it arrived late, and the box arrived all banged up, but everything was there, and there was no damage. Overall, i wish it was cheaper, but it was an excellent purchase."
1,Research before you buy,"Very disappointed. Need external 6 Vdc they don't tell you. Also won't work with older door openers. Had to place three calls to mfg to find out all the fine print that was not included. Would not work with my current opener and a waste of my money. Again, Very disappointed."
3,ok,These garage door opener remotes work as advertised. Not top quality but worth the price. You won't be disapointed.
1,Maybe 100 inches...,This remote has nowhere near a 100 foot range. Even if I had my car inched away from the garage door it wouldn't open with any certtainty. Definitely not worth buying.
5,"A scholarly, chronological documentary","Researched and written by writer, journalist, and Presbyterian elder James D. Snyder, The Faith And The Power is an informed and informative history of the early Christians who struggled to survive a series of bitter and lethal persecutions in Rome during the first century A.D. Highly recommended reading for both scholars and non-specialist general readers, The Faith And The Power integrates Biblical text with historical accounts by early Jewish, Roman, and Christian writers forming the basis of a scholarly, chronological documentary that accessibly explores the fascinating era of nascent Christianity."
3,christians,"as far as history goes, the author was great, however towards the end of the book, the author's view on Christianity was off track --Paul (the apostle)was not Catholic---"
4,Kleanbore Gun Care Universal Muzzleloading Kit,Great value - has plenty of jags and the rod can be used on a big variety of calibers. Good solvent too.
4,John Quincy Adams A Personal History,"While her book is the best I have found on this former President, I find she is the best on the politcal side and presents him in a much better light than Nagal does in his book. When I compare the two books Nagal tries and fails to present Adams as a malajusted man who blames all his problems on his mother. To get a true idea about him you must read both books."
2,Disappointed,"On page 52 of the book the author refers to taking a Masters Class with Joe Pass. That and the continual reference to Pass in the 3rd person gives me the strong impression that this is the transcription of someone's notes. The harmony section has no flow, points are made without the context that one suspects was explained in the class. That said, if you have enough harmony background I suppose you can fill in the many blanks. There is good stuff in here but you have to figure out the context for yourself. Definitely not for the novice. Can't say about the seasoned player."
4,Interesting,This book was Recommended by a friend of mine and I am. still reading it. It's pretty interesting so far
1,Poor attempt,"This film had nothing to redeem it. The story had potential but it was never realized. There was very little exploration about what made the title character, Rayne, different from other full vampires. There was no difference in the capabilities of the vampires in the film and the humans. The scenes of combat always ended with some unrealistic blood spray and there were even scenes of a gang of soldiers lazily hacking at an impossibly still living body. There was also a tired, gratuitous sex scene. This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen."
1,I was expecting greatness...,"So I was expecting a good time. Turner as the writer and Michelle R. in it... However, I was strongly disapointed. I could care less if prostitutes were used as part of the cast (hell, getting paid to not screw some ugly guy), I don't care that the plot was weak (I've watched lamer movies), but the acting, or lack thereof, was unbelievable!!! While I was watching the commentary (yes, I am a freak who watches those) all I could think was that this movie wouldn't be too bad if there was no sound. Just hearing their voices was enough to make me cringe each time I listened. So if you are a glutten for punishment or just have to watch all movies that get horrible reviews then this is for you. Otherwise, skip it and find Michelle on Lost reruns or Turner on the L-Word."
1,oh my goodness....,"Holy cow. I heard that this movie wasn't good, but I had no idea just how bad it was. I've seen these actors in other things and am not sure whether I am more shocked that they agreed to this script or that they agreed to act this poorly. I think it says something when the best performance was given by Meat Loaf. Yes, that is ""Paradise by the Dashboard Lights"" Meat Loaf, and it is a shame that his roll was so small. (I can't believe I just typed that). The draining of the victim from vampire bit CGI effect is pretty good, but from now on, I am sticking to the video games."
1,worst movie ever?,"Could be. We tried to see this in the theater. We left less than have way through. Don't rent, don't buy, don't even watch on commercial television. This movie is a gross waste of time."
1,predictably disappointing,"I had heard of this movie, read reviews in these pages, forgotten about it, and bought it for $7 along with another movie at FYE. I'm glad I only paid that for it, and pretty much agree with these front page reviews. While I haven't delved into the other God knows how many reviews, I must point out that one thing that wasn't mentioned, but contributed greatly to the tedium for me, was the fact that the two female stars were both distinguished by having quite possibly the worst British accents I've ever heard, with the exception of Keanu Reeves in Bram Stoker's Dracula (I think)! Who knows why British is the default accent in horror films, and many other films that are supposed to take place in ANY European country, but Madsen didn't have an accent, so I don't see why the girls needed one - another inconsistency."
1,horrible imitation,"I am dismayed that an actor of the caliber of Ben Kingsley would participate in such a movie. Horrible acting, very cheap effects and sound, the story line is a mish mash of several other movies. No wonder it took less than 1/10th of what it cost to make. I want to give it 0 stars, even though I watched it on DirecTV and didn't spend a cent on it."
1,"Shame, shame!","This movie is about as B as it gets, I hate to say and it's obvious that not alot of time (as well as effort) was put into the film. Being a fan of the video game, I expected a little better. Heck, even Resident Evil is a very enjoyable adapation of a video game as well as Silent Hill compared to this. The all star cast needs to sweep this one under the carpet! Save your money and your sanity!"
1,i put 1 star only because there's no 0 stars,"Oh...my...God....I never thought that in the 21st century -- with all the technology available to even B-movie directors -- that I would see a movie as horrible as this. House of the Dead was horrible, but Bloodrayne was absolutely unacceptable. I mean, this is ridiculous. Who the $#@% is funding this Nazi?! I made the mistake of paying for this movie at the box office, and I have come to the realization that he will continue to make abhorent movies unless EVERYONE STOPS SEEING HIS MOVIES. THAT MEANS DON'T EVEN BE CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT HIS MOVIES ARE ABOUT.SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION TO STOP DR. UWE BOLL FROM MAKING ANYMORE MOVIES! HE'S RUINING VIDEO GAMES!!!DON'T LET HIM DIRECT METAL GEAR FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!!!Go to google and search ""stop uwe boll,"" and you will see what I'm talking about. Uwe Boll must be prevented from raping video games."
1,Thank god for Netflix.,"If I had purchased this movie, I would be more upset than I am.I turned it off about 45 minutes into it, which sadly I can never reclaim that time, but at least I didn't waste a whole hour and a half of my night.It is a sad day for vampires.This move is just horrible."
1,Welcome To The Suck!,"Hello Uggggggggghhhhh Bowl this one of your haters, please stop making movies you ruins the carrers of actors like Christian Slater, Stephen Droff, Michelle Rodríguez, Ben Kingsley and Micheal Madsen and ruins the videogames licenses too, all your movies are trash and you know it even a 7 old year boy can direct better movies with his video-camera i think if you are still making movies your haters will try to kill you and i'm not kidding about that, you better resign to make another movie, i only see 3 of your movies and this crappiest films in the 2005 in some years your movies will become classics like the Ed Wood's movies, is very sad to see a guy like you really."
1,Game,Buy this set for the game not the movie. it's like buying a game a getting a bad movie as bonus content:-D
2,Not what I expected....,"I was very disappointed with this movie and it was horribly done. I understand that it is difficult to make a movie based off of a video game and that this movie wasn't widely released but still... it could have been a lot better. The movie had a great cast but unfortunately that wasnt' enough to save it. The action sequences looked staged, wooden in appearance so there wasn't any believability. The acting was overdone and over the top in some scenes and combined with bad accents it just gave the whole movie a cheesy feeling. I am a fan of the video game and a fan of movies but this one just sucked. I felt like I was watching a really bad made for t.v. movie."
2,My thought on Bloodrayne,"I purchased the dvd of this movie and thought is was about average. I had expected more, the movie was somewhat mindless. After watching several other movies that are derived from a video game I was a little disappointed. But it was a fair movie. I have played the game, and it just did not have the feel of the game. Maybe that is why I was disappointed."
2,Alice Cooper fans DONT BOTHER,"I knew nothing about the movie or the game, I saw it because Alice Coopers new song, ""Mankind"" was SUPPOSED to be in the movie. But I never heard it in the movie. Anyway, The song aint much, but it's alot better then the movie.It's somewhat the same thing as Underworld. A half human half vampire joins a group of people who wanna kill a vampire trying to take over the world.Bonus features: Didnt bother with them."
1,Uwe Boll is truly an inspiration...,"Yep... he teaches the youth of America that no matter how bad your films suck, studios will keep handing you money to make more. So kids... grab a camera and videotape your friend farting... it just might be more entertaining than BloodRayne.0 OUT OF 10 STARS"
1,Do NOT spend ANY money on this!,"All the other reviews have already said what needs said about this movie. I just had to add to the rating, and say that if you just HAVE to sate your curiosity do not spend money to do so. It's not even worth $5 just to see it."
3,"A good deal with the free game, but without it.....","Do not buy this if it is just for the movie. Don't get me wrong, Kristanna Loken looks fantastic and her acting is good, but the direction is quite pathetic. Long drawn out horse chasing sequencies and scenes that seem to make things up as they go along make for a very loose story. With better direction, and editing, it could have been great, especially considering the decent actors involved.The free gane in this package makes it all worthwhile, but without it I would give it a miss."
1,This Movie Even Makes Ben Bad,"I've never played the game before but I knew of it and told myself I had to see this movie, especially because of the great cast. I had no idea what I was getting into and I wish I could get my money back for renting this DVD. One major blowup about this flick is that the fight sequences are way too sloppy and slow. You would think that nobody in this movie had training because everybody's out of shape and off on the fight choreography. There's no good soundtrack and the music they do play is boring. Now one thing that happened that I never thought was that every actor was terrible. It felt like they came to the set after the real movie they were filming and they were dead tired. I am warning anyone interested in seeing this movie to stay away, just don't cause you'll be mad."
2,"""BLOODRAYNE"" IS BLOODY-AWFUL!","There have been many films made recently based on video games, but ""BloodRayne"" is among the worst. The film has a haphazard plot, and the storytelling is extremely weak. The fight sequences are disappointing, with very poor choreography, and lacking in excitement.The acting in the film is terrible. Kristanna Loken gives the film's best performance, while Michael Madsen, Meat Loaf, and the overrated Billy Zane are bad. Even the talented performers Ben Kingsley and Michelle Rodriguez give underwhelming performances.I feel the only people that will enjoy this movie are those who love horror films with tons of gore, sex and nudity. As for the rest of us, I recommend that you skip the bloody-awful ""BloodRayne.""Movie/DVD Grade: D+"
1,German gore,"This is definitely one of the worst vampire films, and worst video adaptation I've ever seen.Way too gory. Lots of scenes that shouldn't have been shown, and I actually mean useless scenes that did not need be shot.Badly acted, badly directed.And the costumes??? how inaccurate can they be. As if women in that time period were showing off their bellies. Please!Much too much lighting for the time period as well.Pure crap.This must have been meant as a comedy, not a horror picture. Nothing scared me in the film."
3,Whoever wrote the script sucks!,I just bought this movie and watched it. The story is totally wrongRayne is supposed to be Kagans Daughter and she didn't come from no Freakshow either. Also I was Hoping to see an Appearance of Beliar like the first Bloodrayne game but nothing Another thing the effects of Kagan dying were lame. I seen better effects in a Castlevania gameThe actors were good but the story was lame!I Liked ultraViolet Better
2,They could have done a LOT better. Like c'mon!,"I was curious as to why people had doomed this as one of the worst movie ever made. Now, after seeing it - I truly understand as to why. The story was written ok, thus giving it a 2 stars, it's the whole acting and the way the actors played their characters. NO MOTIVATION whatsoever. The acting is so dry and lifeless, it's like they're all mummified. And these are supposedly to be great actors. Guess they were forced to perform this movie at gunpoint or something. :-/"
3,"It's not bad, but not real good either","The best parts of this film are the outfit Rayne wears, and the names of the actors on the back of the box. Sadly, the director couldn't put these things together well enough to make a cohesive story. There are some pretty cool fight scenes, and some pretty hot scenes, but the movie fails to deliver a very memorable experience. This movie is just about boobs and beat downs. I really think you should rent it instead of buying it. You don't want this movie taking up space on a shelf at your house."
2,It has potential but it's poorly executed.,It has potential but it's poorly executed. There are some beautiful scenes that put me in the mood. The worst thing is the fighting scenes. They are slow and look completely fake. They should have hired a good stunt woman in place of the main female character.
1,*Spoiler Warning*,"Normally I try to find something good in every movie I see, whether I enjoy it or not. Here's what I came up with for Bloodrayne.The acting is so poor, characters refrain from endearing themselves to the audience at all. The only satisfaction I gained from the money spent on this film was in the last ten minutes, where everyone is viciously, gorily mowed down. So, yay to violent and bloody death.P.S. Turn it off after she sits down in the chair and stares at the camera and it fades out. If you keep watching, you'll be treated to a video catalogue of everyone she killed throughout the movie, before it returns to her face straight on with the camera again. Um, what, Uwe, you had a time minimum to fill?"
2,The worst movie i own.,"Being a huge vampire/horror fan and a fan of the Bloodrayne videogames, i decided to give this movie a whirl.All i can say is ouch.The action scenes are laughable. The actors move in slow motion like they have no coordination. Im guessing this is due to a low budget fight choreographer.And the blood! This movie has got to have the fakest looking blood ive ever seen...Tough im giving this movie two stars for its over the top violence. The decapitations and such are so exaggerated and 'funny' looking that its beyond comical. Think of Kill Bill multiplied 20 times...All in all this is a pretty 'bad' movie from start to finish.Theres pretty much absolutely nothing in this that i would recommend."
1,Not worth it,"It's the first time i regret buying a DVD. I thought it would be a good movie because of the cast, but it turned out to be a low budget-bad director-poor story movie. It's a shame the good names on it, even Kristanna went from femme fatale (terminator 3) to b-movies actress wanna-be."
1,Another Video Game Rape by Mr Boll,"Nothing much to say regarding this film besides avoid at all costs. With production values less impressive than an infant school play and action choreographed by a legless drunkard this film is completely without any form of merit. The acting is atrocious and the story itself is straight out of ""Dummies Guide to Script Writing"". If you are a fan of the games, this game will make you want to kill Mr Boll and if you are not a fan of the games...well, this movie may make you want to kill yourself."
1,I had to see for myself,"Yes, I've read the reviews and heard the complaints, but still I rented this yesterday.To put it bluntly, I wanted to pour bleach in my eyes afterwards."
1,Almost threw it away,"This movie was so bad that I almost threw it away, but then remembered that I had rented it from Blockbuster. The music, special effects, acting, and story line all sucked big time. Can't believe that anyone would make a movie this bad. My older kids like the vampire movies, but after I saw this I decided to pack it up and send it back without even letting them know I had gotten the movie. Next time I will read reviews of movies before renting them, do yourself a favor and skip this one, she looks WAY better in the Terminator movie anyway."
1,What the heck was THAT??!!,"Ok, I give up...what exactly was this film supposed to be? I haven't seen special effects this bad since...well...ever. There must have been a sale on blood packs, because that's the only thing this movie was not in short supply of. They actually had a man on the ground supposedly being hacked to pieces. I saw better at the high school haunted house last year. Totally inexcusable...please people, do not waste your time or money!! They should have paid US to watch the movie."
2,Boll's Greatest Work,Which is not saying much since this along with House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark are the worst movies ever produced. Uwe Boll is a joke and has created a trilogy of failure.
1,Bloodrayne - Complete Trash,"If their was a category lower than ""B movie,"" this movie would fall into it. The acting, story, and action sequences are corny and poor."
3,Almost there,"I bought this movie purely because I loved the game. (that was the 3rd star)At first glance it seems to have it - good actors, nice CGI,passable storyline, untill the action scenes started - and all that fake blood. It fell apart very fast.The tragedy is that with the ingredients that is there, it could have been very good."
3,Don't think of it as a movie with a free game.....,"Think of it as a game with a free movie!This edition apparently includes the PC version of BloodRayne 2, which retails here on Amazon for $29.99, and has some pretty decent reviews. So if you want the game, buy this disc instead, and you'll also get a movie that's likely to inspire you to all sorts of video-game violence (probably because the movie is just SO BAD, but that's just what the reviews say :-)"
3,Its not that bad.......,"What we have here is a pretty good movie that has been handicapped by some wooden acting and some miscasting but thats about it. Its not as tight as some of the other action movies around but it sure had quite a budget for all the gory specialeffects..reminded me of Tom Savini's work a bit. Anyway we do have some great sets...good moody music, action and a story.And i did not fall asleep once....which is good."
1,This Director Sucks,"Everything this guy touches turns to crap. I haven't even seen this movie and I can tell you from passed experience with ""Alone in the Dark"" and ""House of the Dead"" that this guy is a no-talent-ass-clown. I'm just grateful he didn't get the job for ""Silent Hill"" like he wanted. Whatever you do, don't buy this. There's a reason they have to through in a free game with it."
1,Oh my god,"Why does Hollywood let Uwe Boll even near a movie? He's screwed up 3 video game movies now. First was the piece of crap House of the Dead, Then there was Alone in the dark (a movie that had nothing to do with the game), then Bloodrayne. What was Hollywood thinking? Third time's a charm? No. Not with Uwe it isn't. It's still crap. This movie was terrible. It looked like it was filmed in the early 90's. Like Hurcules or Xena. It was just low quality.If you were thinking of watching this move, save yourself some time. Go buy the video game. It's much better.It seems Uwe is out to kill every video game he can. According to IMDB.com he's liknked to Postal, Far Cry, Fear Effect, Hunter:The Reckoning,and he's already got a Dungeon Siege movie done.Please.. Everyone. Let's refuse to go to these movies. Don't spend your hard earned movies on these pieces of garbage. Enough is enough."
1,Don't Buy IL State TurboTax,"All the Amazon.com reviews seem to agree that Turbotax State is a bad product. It is!I used TurboTax State for Illinois. When I tried to file electronically, TurboTax rejected the filing because of an entry on line 9 of IL-1040. It's true that you can't file IL-1040 electronically if there are certain subtractions on that line. BUT, TurboTax entered a 0.00 on that line, then read it as a number and refused to electronically file. There are no subtractions on that line. I was able to file the same information on ILtax.com. It was acceptable, but not to TurboTax.The IL State web site works fine to file taxes, but I had to enter a lot of information all over again--just what I bought Turbotax State to avoid.When I went on line and the phone, I got a complete runaround--just as you've read about in other reviews.So, I bought a product that has no function, but TurboTax won't be responsible."
1,Turbotax is a rip off,"Last year they have home depreciation in deluxe 2002. This year, with deluxe 2003, you're forced to make a $40 upgrade.DONT BUY. INTUIT IS TRYING TO RIP PEOPLE OFF."
1,turbo tax 2003 screwed us again,"they were so nice to let you use it on multiple computer's but now you can only file 1 return electronically. How stinking greedy are these folks. They will get no more of my hard earned money for this product. Every year iit is something else with them, they are like the government, you cannot trust them. next year I will do tax cut and I WILL TELL ALL MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS NOT TO BUY THIS PRODUCT EVER AGAIN. TT SUCKS, IT IS A MINUS 10 IN MY RATINGS."
2,"BRITISH Southern, not USA's Southern; Ships, not Trains!","Careful! A train enthusiast (like me!) might read the title and subtitle of this book and think: ""A review of (US) Southern Railway's [locomotive] fleet in 1946"" Ah-ha! An undiscovered treasure from SR's steam-to-diesel locomotive conversion period, for the year following the end of WWII, when the [locomotive] fleet was exhausted from all the extra wartime service. Sorry, but no . . .! In this case, ""Fleet"" really does mean ships, and this is the ""Southern Railway"" located in Britain, not the Southeastern U.S. . . .!Not a bad little book, really, for its topic. Full of B&W; ""large-postcard"" size photos of a bunch of British ships; from 1946. The book is in a ""large-postcard"" format, softcover binding, a bit of blue and red for the cover.Remember, to paraphrase the old saying, the British and Americans are two people divided by a common language . . .!"
4,jamboree dvd,"I purchased this dvd for the Slim Whitman segment. The story line is a bit weak but I enjoyed seeing Buddy Knox, Fats Domino, Jerry Lee Lewis and others I had'nt heard of. The quality of the disc is excellent."
2,Jamboree,"Let's face it kids, this movie was bad when it came out and time does not alter that fact, however it is fun to look back and see this celluloid history of Rock N' Roll!"
3,This could have been a whole lot better,"For students of 1950's rock&roll this DVD should be in your collection of all things 50s'. Again, as was the case with all 50s' rock&roll movies, the recording stars of the era are the ""stars"" of the film. Carl Perkins, Frankie Avalon, Charlie Gracie, Fats Domino(seeing him sing ""wait & see"" is worth the cost of the DVD alone). But, sadly, ""Jamboree"" is technically very disappointing. A little attention to detail whould have made Slim Whitman, Charlie Gracie, Jimmy Bowen & Buddy Knox appear a lot better ... what happened to the guitar solo in ""hula love""? Were the producers of the film in hurry to get this in the cinemas? Apart from its technical flaws, there are (some) great 50s rock&roll acts in ""Jamboree"" and some rarely seen long forgotten names like Jodie Sands & the 4 Coins. For 1950s' music fans only."
3,Schlocky movie with some cool musical performances,"It's great to see Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee, Fats Domino and others perform in this film, although the soap opera plot of two young singers managed by two divorced spouses is a little much at times"
2,Not addressing the real wage difference,"Farrell contends that women make less due to the fact that they pick ""easier"" or more pleasant jobs than men. This may be the case in some instances, but I picked up this book because I thought it was about the wage imbalance, not what an average man makes compared to the avg woman. The wage imbalance is for the SAME jobs, not different ones.Farrell says things like women make less because they choose to be day care providers instead of accountants. Again, I'm not saying this is not the case, but that does NOT address why women accountants make LESS than male accountants (with the same education, years of experience, etc). THAT is the real wage imbalance and Farrell just tells one common sense (like that a liberal arts degree gets you less money than a technology degree). I hope this ""researcher"" didn't get any money for his ""research"" on this. It's COMMON SENSE, not research!Don't waste your money on this book!!!"
4,Rockin' with Richard,"This hard to find treasure is a career retrospective from a New Orleans artist who had one across the board hit (which netted him several television appearancesand a very wacky video) and then seemingly disappeared. But, as we all know, what's BIG in New Orleans stays in New Orleans, and Richard is apparently still rocking.His big hit ""Who Stole My Monkey"" steals the show!"
3,Sad to say...,"27 tracks and a concert DVD for under $15? It's hard to complain about that, but I will.In writing this review, I should mention that I haven't even watched the DVD yet. I've actually just finished listening to the CD, and had to comment.We all know that live performances are much more difficult to ""mix"", but whoever was on audio for this recording just did not know his job. The instrumentals weren't much of a problem, but the vocal recording was just terrible. It overpowered all the other elements and sounded like it was recorded on a My First Sony tape recorder. Oddly enough, the CD sounds worse than the samples on Amazon.I gave it three stars because the music is brilliant, and I liked it when I've heard other recordings, but it lost two stars because of the sound quality (or lack thereof) on this CD.In short, I would rather spend the $45+ to get all these songs on the various other albums."
2,Not impressed!!!,I saw Atom And His Package a year before this and I was amazed that the dvd wasn't that good. The best parts were when Adam played the guitar at the show I saw him at in person he played guitar most of the time. Now I don't mind that some of his songs he didn't play guitar but I think he should have on more. Plus when I saw him in concert he was a lot funnier. Lastly the dvd wasn't made very well adams voice was set way to loud and was so high pitched it hurts the ears. Picture quality was awesome but thats the most I could say. On another positive you get a lot of songs on the dvd and cd and it is a full concert. I haven't listened to the cd because what good does it do me I own almost every album. Sorry Adam great idea but didn't end up right unfornate.
2,Poor quality,"It is a great idea for a DVD, but the quality of the video was not good at all. My 14 month old was bored and wants me to change the DVD every time I try to put it in. He is much more interested in Baby Einstein."
1,must be for older kids,"Bumble bee kids makes a series of 5 dvd's that are done very well, and geared for the 6month-2 year old. My 6 month old has watched some of them every day and never gets tired of them. I bought this aphabet video by bumble bee kids for him when he was 19 months, and the kids in the video do not speak clearly, and sometimes whisper the words. My son asked me to turn it off by the time we were at the letter ""H"". They should use the little girl who does the singing in their body parts video. She has personality, and can speak clearly, and babies love her. This video is going to the goodwill I am afraid. The kids speak with lisps in this video."
2,Poor production,"I really really wanted to believe in this product because it was created by professionals. The production was of poor quality and looked as if my child edited the video. This video is certainly not worth $19.95 when there are better options out there (Leapfrog's Letter Factory). Not meant to sound mean, but half the children on the DVD can't even speak properly nor do I want my child sounding like them. It's very unclear to me what age range they're targeting with this DVD as well. Save your money and buy ""Meet the Letters"" around 9mos-12mos and ""Letter Factory"" around 15-18 mos."
2,Too big for S-series cameras,"This case is too big for the S series cameras. The whole point of a thin camera is not to take up much space and in this case not only is the camera loose, but also takes up more space than it needs to be. Perhaps it works better for Z series cameras if they are thicker, but it is advertised for both, and dimensions are not posted."
4,Great product,"Nice case, fits the Z600 perfectly, includes space for extra memory card storage. Belt loop requires belt to be threaded through, I would have preferred a belt clip, but that's personal preference."
2,not good for higher quality systems,"if you are using this box with a higher quality sound system, you will be quite distracted by the high-pitched background squeal that this unit introduces. so for better quality switching find a higher end unit or do as i have reverted to doing, and change cables manually."
3,Not As Shown,"My wife and I had to return this product not because of any defect in the product, but because the product and product images shown here are NOT the same. We needed a switch box with buttons on top for a handicapped child so they could use different devices without having to plug and unplug the cords. The switches on this product are on the front (which would be hard for him to use), if you need one with switches on the top check a different model, but make sure you message the seller first to see if the item is the same as the picture."
5,Works as advertised,I used this since my TV has only a single RCA input. I connected my Wii and VCR to the TV through this. It has worked very well for me and saved the trouble of switching cables each time I change the input.
3,Inexpensive & Easy But Not Perfect,"This unit is extremely affordable and very easy to use. I had no problem getting everything hooked up in mere minutes, which is great when you have 5+ different components to hook up to one TV. On the downside, it tends to degrade an HD signal. While I can use all my components and consoles, I don't get to enjoy my previously flawless HDTV. However, it will do in a pinch until I can afford a more expensive switch box and it will be handy to keep around in case of future component emergencies."
3,Cheap but Effective,"I bought this because of the s video connections but they don't work properly, the signal comes in black and white, I don't know what that's all about. It was cheaper than most and it does the job on the RCA cable, so I'll keep it for now."
1,Thought it would solve problems...Just created more.,"Really wanted to use this on our spare Mitsubishi to use cable box, Roku, and DVD player. Something simple for the kids (touch the button change the source). It hooked up fine and I recognized I would probably lose some picture clarity but all I got was spastic gray static. I changed out all cables, still the same mess. Audio fine, video looked like the picture was coming through dark gray flashing fog. Don't bother. Should send it back but shipping hassle just not worth it."
4,RCA VH911 Video Switch Box,"This is nice, but make sure your TV is A newer model or it will not work, no coaxial input or out put, only the newer plugs. So....if I had a newer tv I could give you a better refrence."
3,Good for the price but only last about a year,"I like the switch box and only use it for audio but this is not the first one I have had. I bought my first one about a year ago and it was failing, the button that switch the audio and video still work but the board on the inside was going bad cause the sound only played through one side of the speakers. I gave it a three star rating only because it lasted a year. The one area where I use the box failed in a year so now I had to buy another one. So far so good, have to wait and see if this one preforms. Oh and the picture of this product is very much incorrect, looks nothing like the picture, it not black, it gray and the buttons are on the front not the top and its more of a box than what they are showing in the picture.Jim"
4,"good gloves, good service","My husband likes these gloves because of the 3 fingertip style. I decided to order on Amazon when I was not able to find in any of the local stores. I received quickly after ordering, and gave them to my husband as one of his birthday presents. He was VERY surprised and happy, and is using them now."
1,Waste of a good idea,"Didn't like this at all. What a waste of a good idea (mind you, that could be said about many books). The characters failed to interest me in the slightest. It seemed that every man jack of them was a walking cliche with a couple of (heavily belaboured) idiosyncrasies stuck on top in a vain attempt to hide the dullness. The heavy with a heart? The young woman living in a dreamworld? The grasping marketing exec? The charismatic American fixer? The shady 'safe pair of hands'? How many times have we seen these people before? Stick to the ideas Rupert Thomson, and get someone else to turn them into a story for you."
1,the worst book i ever read,"the plot is set up in such a way that the reader is constantly 2 steps ahead of the author, and i was irritated and anxious for him to catch up to me - he never did. and then there are the characters - poorly drawn (unless you take repetiive and meandering descriptions of idiosyncracies as character), totally unsympathetic, dull and really just stupid whereas i believe - and admittedly im not really sure what the author intended with this excessively mediocre, plodding and boring piece of fiction - the author simply meant them to be flawed. the conclusion - i can't rightfully call it a ""climax"" - is especially indicative of the rest of the novel - meandering, pointless, and expected. there is nothing real or interesting to grasp onto here and i resent the author for every minute i spent reading this book. there is nothing original or intersting here."
4,nice style,"This is a really nice set and I have only just started to use it, works fine so far, however I have just noticed a hole on the side, about one and a half inches from the bottom of the stainless steel part of the shaker. If you are just getting into mixing drinks for casual entertaining,for the price and free shipping,would still recommend this three piece shaker set."
2,Good deal--until it breaks!,"I bought this ""kit,"" and thought it was just fine--at first. However, unfortunately, it is possible for the glass and metal to form a seal (cold vs. less cold? Some science class I missed?) and in that case, there is no way to get the two pieces apart without running hot water over them, and thereby throwing out the contents. In my case, the glass simply cracked as I tried to separate the halves, and the whole thing ended up in the trash. I went with a different brand, and I HIGHLY recommend paying a few extra dollars for a glass shaker with a rubber gasket over its top. This prevents any of the ""accidents"" which made mine trash within less than a month...the strainer, however, is just fine, and works well with the new shaker I had to buy."
1,Very disappointing,"I have had a more expensive shaker (WMF Boston Cocktail Shaker) for several years which I'm generally very happy with. My only complaint was that the measures on the side are not as fine as I would like. So I purchased this set.First off I found it hard to use because all of the recipes on the side of the shaker are distracting. I have no use for them, so for me they are just noise. I continued to use my old shaker except when I wanted to take advantage of the smaller measures on this shaker. Disappointingly, within about four trips through the dishwasher the printing has started to come off. I've checked my other shaker and all the printing is in perfect condition despite, I expect, more than 100 trips through the dishwasher.I can't recommend this product to anyone."
1,A must have for those trying to quit,"I'm writing this as my Margarita sits on the shaker, which is completely stuck and will not come apart. I've tried all angles, shaking only for 5 seconds and the damn thing gets stuck each and every time. There is no science behind this, and I'm sure I'm doing everything right...it's gotten to the point where I've had to add boiling water to the damn thing so it comes apart.The problem could be the thinness of the metal part, which contracts when it gets cold incredibly fast and creates the problem.In other words, if you are trying to quit drinking, this is a must get."
4,"Great, but...","We love this and it has been very useful, but be aware; if you put it in the dishwasher the printing on the glass eventually wears off so I would suggest hand-washing that part."
3,good unless you wash it,The first time I washed this set (before using it) the lettering came off of the glass.Ok other than that...
5,Great Item,"Great little boston shaker, great price for what you get.The strainer coil isn't really that tight and could become annoying if you were straining things with mint leaves, but other than that its fine.The glass is tough and seems well made.When mixing drinks I've had no leaks at all, I think most of the people who say it leaks are the ones who don't know how to use a boston shaker.Highly recommended. Very pleased for the price."
5,"Perfect set, great quality",This set has been a great addition to my bar. Components are high quality and can go right in the dishwasher for cleaning. May have to order another kit soon for parties.
1,WORST SELLER,the product: omni clean soft gel pill works great! i used it many times and passed many drugtests. although this seller sent me the wrong item and im having trouble getting the right item. BUY ELSE WHERE
3,Not All It's Cracked Up to Be,"Was looking for a meditation-type book, but this one is so ""gentle,"" that it sounds like so many other ""self-help gurus"" that are out there spouting nonsense and urging alcoholics and addicts to embrace their 'inner child!""Rubbish!If I ever get my hands on MY inner child, HE NEEDS SPANKED! LOLOn the other hand, there are some good exchanges between sponsee and sponsor. That's why I bought the book in the first place, so I guess I got what I wanted (more or less—and honestly, probably ""less than more..."")Oh well. I won't drink over it!"
1,Belongs in the humor section,"Or else the fiction section.This book is the biggest collection of liberal lies ever told.(BTW, ""progressive"" is just a polite word for ""Marxist."")UPDATE: Reviews which take swipes at other reviewers, mentioning them by name, are immature and inappropriate. Be sure to report them to Amazon.com!"
1,Appropriate,"The title is...well, arrogant. Typical. Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand. I was a liberal for several years...a tax big/spend big, race card playing, big government, pro-choice, selfish, finger-pointing liberal. Then I matured."
3,"Gutty, Thought Provoking, Too Short","I like Carville. He's blunt without being rude; truthful without being mean, and opinionated without being obnoxious. This book offers viewpoints on a variety of topics that are contrary to popular opinion that Republicans like Limbaugh (does this guy ever take a breath?) have shoved down our throats. That's one of the areas I am disappointed in Carville; he doesn't go after Limbaugh like I expected him to. Carville also makes weak arguments why we should be against charter schools and vouchers for the same. But, Carville is not afraid to challenge Republicans and other right-wingers to their beliefs. Overall, a fun read; wish it were longer."
1,Nothing new here...,"Read it just to see what I may have been missing...not much. Same old tired rhetoric, defends what cannot possibly be defended. Save your money, wait til he goes on C-Span for a good laugh."
1,Liberalism at it's worst!,"I don't want to waste my time writing about this sad piece of literature, but I will say this: Right is right and no matter how much the left lies that is way it is going to be."
4,Carville is the Original serpent in the garden of Eden!,"The Seperpant head spews total garbage and nonsense, yet again! What a waste of Money this book is! Did I say book, it is more garbage! Progressives, come on who do you think your fooling, the is liberalism at its worst! Grow up carville, and grow a brain while your at it!"
1,"James Carville, apologist for the indefensible!!!","James Carville has a brilliant mind, and nobody can ""spin"" the truth the way he can. But I respect him the way I respect ALL the great criminal defense attorneys --- not at all!!! He knows he's defending the indefensible, so he simply changes the direction of the argument, attacking the attackers, and using a nonstop deluge of twisted logic to make his often irrelevant points. If I ever get into SERIOUS TROUBLE for SERIOUS MISCONDUCT, yes, I'll certainly want James Carville on my side (and Johnny Cochran, too!) But for shaping my political philosophy I'll look elsewhere, thank you!"
1,"All Style, No Substance","""We're going to take over the world...and then turn the Oval Office into a rock star's dressing room.""Thanks, James.Too bad you wasted your considerable skills on the most incredibly self-absorbed man-child to ever reach this country's highest office."
4,The Beliefs Behind A Book,"An excellent educational experince of beliefs.The belief of ""We're Right, They're Wrong,"" is the fundamental cause of war, plus all the other acts of atrocity we homo sapiens have inflicted upon each other throughout history and will probably lead to our extinction. Unless, of course, we choose to educate ourselves on the dynamics of beliefs and evolve beyond this ancient thought process.If you are open to this, you can see it clearly. When we are indoctrinated into the belief structures of a culture, political persuasion or religion, it becomes the Immutable Truth. When confronted by other belief structures, the indoctrinated beliefs resist extinction, so we slander, discriminate or kill the other since that is much easier (after all, we're right and they're wrong!) than modifying a belief of an Immutable Truth. It's happened for thousands of years and is happening now throughout the world and most are still unaware this dynamic."
4,Bought this because of Kevin Bold,Another good book from Mr. Carville; I found it refreshing and truthful...
4,Truth is disappearing commodity,"Read this book - if for no other reason than to separate the fact from the misinformation and fiction. There is no other way to save the Nation.Anyone who voted for the Shrub deserves the hardships and increased threat of terrorist attack resulting from his regime of smoke, mirrors and moronic mantras.Carville tells it like it is - like it or not. This is a book for pragmatists"
2,Matalin missing!,This one-sided essay clearly falls short of the insight of All s Fair. Carville s rambles offer little to challenge the reader even one who normally agrees with his views.
1,All that the title reveals...,"I beleive the title generally speaks for the book. It tells us many things about Mr. Carville and his opinions. It tells us Carville proclaims himself infallable and superior to all other freely formed opinions. It tells us Mr. Carville is a radical leaning leftist who opposes everything conservative for the sake of stubborn pride. It tells us Mr. Carville believes in ""our way or no way"" politics rather than compromise and pragmatism. It tells us Mr. Carville enjoys slandering his oppositions with name calling rather than actually addressing issues. It tells us Mr. Carville has a case of great hubris. It tells us Mr. Carville is one of a closed mind for all opinions which dissent from his are ""wrong"" as specifically announced by the title. It tells us Mr. Carville is but another noisy fool..."
1,oi!,"I have started to read some of these political books, why is it that the liberals feel the need to cuss in thier books? Listened to the audio book, he just went on a trirade.Too much cussing.No new ideas."
2,trite,"I can't stand reading snippets, and Mr. Carville can't seem to write a complete paragraph. If you enjoy the USA Today style of presentation, this book is for you; otherwise, it's a waste of money. Mr. Carville does stand up for some government programs that might otherwise be forgotten, which makes the book at least mildly interesting."
4,Not what it is advertised but a good addition to the AT&T story,Dick Martin was a VP of communication/marketing sat AT&T and offers a unique perspective on why they collapsed. Frankly I think he is wrong and the reasons offered in End of the Line are far more on track. Martin takes his inside perspective and focuses on his department only which leaves a lot of the problems out. He tries to show the ego war between the top executives which does come out to be interesting but the long term strategic goals are not illustrated very well here. It is written decently enough but could definitely offer more information. A good follow up to End of the Line if you are really interested in AT&T otherwise I would skip it.
5,Think Again,"Quite frankly, I was surprised that Dick Martin shared as much as he did in this book, given his continuing legal obligations to AT&T. While I worked at AT&T Corporation, the book provided a very different perspective on the company's demise. It was engaging, and very well written. To those who discounted the book because its lessons are primarily in the area of Public Relations, I say, think again. Specifically, consider Martin's quotation of Arthur W. Page: ""All business lives by public approval and, roughly speaking, the more approval you have, the better you live."""
1,"Tedious, at Best","Dick Martin had an excellent position inside AT&T; with which to report on the ""perfect storm"" of technological change, intensifying competition, and government intervention (both by Congress and the courts). At the same time, the industry was melting away with the advent of cellular, its biggest competitor (MCI WorldCom) felt free to slash prices because it was making up its financial results as it went along (forcing AT&T; to lose about $5 billion in revenues/year), and AT&T; was seeming going in circles - diversifying (eg. into cable) - then returning to its roots, promoting new outside leadership (eg. Walters, from a printing firm) - then firing, opposing Baby Bell entry into its long-distance - then supporting (with conditions), etc.Unfortunately, Martin does not provide a structured summary of these events - instead he remains mired in the details of P.R. actions and responses associated with them - a topic of little interest or importance."
2,Pretty Myopic Actually,"I ordered this book in order to read it during my vacation. I was hopeful that it would convey some general history and broad lessons associated with the collapse of the most powerful telecommunications company on the planet. Instead, I found that the book focused primarily on the PR experience of the author which was somewhat contributory, but ancillary to the steps and mis-steps of the AT&T; decline. Overall, I found this very disappointing.I am reading ""End of the Line"" by Leslie Cauley and am finding it a much more interesting view of the AT&T; rise/decline. The book is better written and much more informative. My 2 cents."
3,Tough Calls: AT&T and the Hard Lessons Learned from the Telecom Wars,"An OK effort, but I would recommend Cauley's book: The End of the Line as less sychophantic effort at explaining the incompetence and greed that brought down an American Institution."
4,For Maria Fans,"I am a self-confessed Maria fan having fell in love with her while watching ""Moscow on the Hudson."" Since I long ago had replaced my VHS with a DVD player I scowered craigslist.org for a replacement unit. After obtaining an unit, I danced away almost to heart attack status. Since Maria and I are age appropriate, I noted that this tape was done almost two decades ago when we all looked better. She still looks good and a current view can get my heart pumping and more. Because of the lack of a DVD version, I downgraded it."
5,Fracas compact,"I purchased this for my mother-in-law for mother's day, she loved it. She's been wearing Fracas for the 15 yrs that I've known her & she loved this new ""form"" of her favorite perfume."
2,Gilgamesh the mundane,"Being fond of ancient Sumer in general and the Gilgamesh epic in particular, I found Mr. Silverberg's book a profound disappointment. It appears that the author's intention was to rework the venerable story to remove its fantastic elements. Along the way he practically ignores an interesting milieu, makes the characters boring, and replaces dynamic episodes with confusing ones.Admittedly, Mr. Silverberg did make an effort to make his characters seem as though they actually are living in a different day and time. However, as historical fiction this book falls flat. (If you want historical fiction set in Sumer check outThe Three Brothers of Urby J.G. Fyson, and forget this book.)"
1,"This is not ancient Sumer, let alone Gilgamesh","I thought I would love this book. I have a passion for ancient Sumer and I love historical fiction. Silverberg's research is average, his characters are average, and his setting is boring. One small anacronym that really bothered me was the spring rain. Rain comes to southern Iraq (Ancient Sumer) in the Winter. I admit, probably with Silverberg's abilities it was not easy to research Sumer. Little is known about the ancient culture as compared to Egypt, Rome, or Greece. But, he could have put more effort into the characters. When Enkidu died, I was like, ""So?"" I had no sympathy for any of the characters. They weren't real. It did begin to become intersting when Gilgamesh traveled to Dilmun. That place seemed to stir some imagination, but Sumer seemed so boring. And it was anything but. A good historical novel on the Sumerians needs to be done. I guess I'll do it."
5,So far so good,A cookbook is hard to rate when you first receive it as it takes a while to work through the recipes but we have made the Chickpeas and Sweet Potato dish as well as the Kidney Bean Dal and have been pleased by both. Neither was difficult and both are actually spicy in a very satisfying way. I checked this out of the library first and found so many I liked that I decided to purchase. Look forward to making some of the others!
5,Converting me to poetry,"Until picking up Jean's book, I hadn't remembered liking poetry. Her whimsical, lyrical honesty captures refreshing new ideas. Like the very best short stories should, she is free to play with absurdities, and her poems do so with grace."
1,Jen Fe Fat Loss Power Patch,"The product did not work. It did however give me a rash and cause me to itch constantly. It was a complete waste of money. Also, the dealer was very rude when asked about time of delivery. Paid extra for quick delivery and did not get it in a timely manor. Would not recommend or purchase anything from this dealer again!"
1,First day,"I ordered both the regular and power up (or what ever it's called) product through full life. I thought that if I started out with the lower dose for the first 2wks then moved on to the higher dose for the 2nd 2wks it may help.Today was the first day of wearing a patch, and I didn't feel any difference. No decreased appetite or energy boost. I know there is no magic cure for being fat and I did not expect this from Jen Fe, I just hoped that a patch may be easier for me considering I have ulcers and caffeine bothers my stomach something awful. I'll keep trying for the two weeks then review again."
1,EnviroCare instead of Hoover,I should have checked reviews more closely before ordering... I actually got 50% success - I received one set of Hoover bags and one set of EnviroCare. This merchant should send genuine replacements to all.
5,These bags suck and that is why I bought 'em,"I really love these vacuum cleaner bag. They work so well making my apartment clean. Before I bought these bags my life was not complete. Once the bag arrived a new day started. ""Happy Days Are Here Again!!!"" These bags are the bestest."
1,Not as Advertised,"The bags provided may be great, but the ad says they are made by Hoover and the picture shows the Hoover packaging. What you receive are bags by EnviroCare Technologies, ""designed to fit"" Hoover. I would really like to get exactly what was advertised and what I ordered."
1,Complete Failure,"Simply - They don't work!Too small for a refund request. These are sort of a ""scam"" product.They have no effect whatsoever on RF in modern telephones.ji"
2,This does not work with cordless phones,"I ordered this to use with my cordless phone and headset and discovered when I received it that it only works with corded phones. It plugs into the telephone receiver, then the telephone cord plugs into the other side of the Rf filter. I tried it on my corded phone and it didn't help reduce the buzzing sound in my new wireless headset. I then called Plantonics and they're replacing the headset, so I can't comment on how well the device works when you have a functional headset."
1,NO HDMI upgrades,"This flagship product was marketed as ""future-proof"". The world's first upgradable receiver. Well, Onkyo has offered only one upgrade card and has dropped the TX-NR1000 from it's current line up of products. Onkyo has never made an official announcement to it's customers, but they are not going to offer HDMI upgrades for this product. It was made with HDMI 1.0 and that's how it stays. Apparently, when designing this ""future-proof"" design, they didn't allow for HDMI changes.Do Not Buy This Dead End Product."
3,I won't pay more than $5 for this movie,"It was a bit unrealistic, guns seem to come from nowhere and the national guard puts on a big man hunt for one guy when they are overburdened with looting and riots. Luckily there were no special effects that made the movie cheesy."
3,A little too heavy duty,"I wanted a nice set of measuring cups and purchased this set. Although they are very well made and will probably last several lifetimes, they're pretty heavy and I find myself reaching for my lighter weight ones."
4,Deadline,I thought the author really gets the point across. Obviously he has done his homework. Please write more.
4,It's Not Just A Job - It's an Adventure,"When I see the amazing things that get done in American business, I often wonder, ""How'd they DO that?"" This book answers the question - for some pretty amazing projects. And there's also some important lessons here, no matter what kind of work you may be in. Like a lot of people, I tend to put work off until the last minute. If you're like that, too, these stories will make your hair stand on end. EVERY minute is the ""last minute."" Huge amounts of money on the line. And it reads more like an adventure story than a dull business book."
3,I Can Speak French,"Slightly confusing to use at first, but quickly provides phrases & words for immediate use. Has voice so you can hear how the words are pronounced, which is very helpful."
1,Sound just too bad...,"I bought this cd because I was curious how Martha Argerich played when she was a child. I was prepared for a sound not that great. However, you can really hardly hear the piano. Even in those days they could have done a better job! I am a big Martha Argerich fan, but I would not recommend this cd."
5,What a great show!,I love this show and the box set is awesome! I missed a few episodes while it was on TV because I came into the series late. Thanks to Amazon I was able to buy the box set and watch the entire series.
4,Poorly ground,The materials and design are good. They fell down on the finish. It looks like the person running the grinder was drunk. You will need to re-grind the edge and sharpen before use. I expected better for the price.
5,BEST Gloves i've had,"These gloves were everything I expected and then some....A little stiff during the first 30-45 minutes of using them the first time, but once they were broke in the comfort level was phenominal!! The quality of these gloves is outstanding! I planned on ordering another pair but i don't think these will ever wear out!!! GREAT PRODUCT!!!"
4,very effective training gloves,"I've been using my Harbinger 1260s for approximately three weeks. The padding on the 1260s took a little getting used to. The majority of my weight training is on machines that have rubber padding on the grips. This makes gripping with the Harbingers a little awkward at first, but I got used to it after a couple of workouts. Only time will tell whether these gloves hold up as well as my old Nikes. I used those for over three years (they were lost) lifting weights 3 times a week."
2,Pads're too thick,The quality of the items is decent but for my palms the pads are too thick. I've got small palms. When I do pooling exercises I can't have good grip of the bar or dam bells so it fills uncomfortable. Now I use Nike training gloves which are very thin and thins one I keep for other time.
2,was not as my expectations,"it was i good material, but it was not as i expected. the glove was too thick so i could not have the good grip."
2,Too clunky,I thought I was buying these for great wrist support but the barley covered my wrist. They are too thick and don't feel natural when lifting.
2,Not Made to Last,"When I first began to lift weights, I was not expecting the type of abuse my hands would take. Initially, I didn't mind the calluses that developed as a result of the iron I was moving. I made this purchase to prevent any painful or ugly consequences. After about a week or two of lifting dumbbells and doing pullups, I noticed that the thread holding the gloves' material together slightly unraveled.From that point forward, the gloves continued to fall apart. Rather than spend the money for a new pair, I decided to repair the gloves myself by using a thicker thread. I sewed the material together on each finger until the gloves were repaired. If you are just beginning to lift weights, I do not recommend spending money on these gloves; first decide if you want to continue with training. If you plan on sticking to it, invest in a more durable pair."
2,too small,it was way too small.... size large felt like a small medium. I didn't try to return it. Just not using it.
3,Training gloves,"Cannot really rate these as I had to send them back because the size chart they give you to go by was not quite accurate & the gloves did not fit. I had given them as a gift & since I had to return them & pay the postage on returning them I did not order another pair. It's just not an item that can be ordered on line. As far as the order, I received it on time & I had no problems returning it."
3,2nd pair of harbinger gloves,"gloves are ok, but the gel padding is not as good as the 1st pair of harbinger gloves i had. their website did not give a very good picture of the pad area, so i took a shot. a bit pricey, but they all are these days."
3,Quality,"Product as pictured, or so I thought. Gloves are extremely comfortable. Unfortunately the stitching is substandard and with less than 20 Hours of use the thumbs stitching is unraveling. This aside my biggest complaint is I assumed that the same padding /insulation pictured on top of the fingers would also be on the thumb. There is no padding at all on the thumb making it extremely uncomfortable to do free weight curls, because your thumb is always chaffing the inside of the dumbbell."
4,Fit and perform well.,Gloves are great. They protect your skin from the weights but are light and breathable so you don't sweat a lot. Solid purchase!
4,Honest review,"Works great, fits well and I have been able to lift longer since lifting weight is just much more comfortable on the hands."
4,Well made BUT...,"These are well made gloves... (I haven't had them long) but the padding that I got them for is in all the wrong places. I got these specifically for bench pressing heavy weight, but the padding is all in the fingers and upper part of the hand. There should be more in the lower palm where all the weight sits. That being said, they are nice and snug and feel durable. I have not had similar problems as others with not being able to close my hands for different exercises. I like these gloves overall."
5,Excellent,"I use this book over the Compaq fortran 90 language manual sometimes. Examples are easy to follow and the writing is very clear. Many examples. There is a nice section at the back on obsolete fortran 77 conventions, and their replacements. It's a nice compact book too - you don't realize how much information it contains because it's not enormous and heavy. I recommend it to anybody"
4,Almost perfect,"The only thing I wasn't to keen on is the fact that the size is a bit larger than listed. These were size 7, but are much closer to a 7 1/2. Otherwise, they're fine."
4,Sin and vengeance,I Am haveing trouble loading this book in order to Read the driving book Please allow me to turn this book in so I can try another one I will come back to this one another time
1,Great Read,"I could not quit reading this book for a minute, CJ West I a very good author. I want to read more. I will be looking for another book by this same one."
4,Original,"Enjoyed this book. Fast and entertaining. Characters were a lot of fun. Adventure kept stirring curiousity. Sex, violence, all that good stuff! Good read."
2,Meh,"Spoilers ahoy!I liked the writing and the plot well enough, but had a hard time caring one way or the other about any of the characters. Randy is obviously a whack-job and I honestly don't even care how he got that way. Charles is an egotistical ass. Charlie is a lemming. Deidre isn't much better than a lemming. The only two who I remotely liked were Laroche (And even he's sketchy) and Elisabeth. Tho why she didn't just walk out when she figured out what was going on I'm not sure I'll ever understand. You're husband is a lying sack of crap at best and a murderer at worst... hmmm. Gaaaaaaah."
3,in between,"In reading the reviews I find myself somewhere in between ""I couldn't put it down"" and the ones that said it was so boring they couldn't finish it. It is true that it starts out slowly and I thought of deleting it from my kindly several times but I plodded through and was glad I did. Probably about the time one reviewer said he gave up on the book it became much more exciting.If you have the patience to wait for the action to pick up I would recommend this book."
3,new,I have been listening to this book on my kindle with the text to voice function. I wasn't sure I would like the book but listening to it has got me hooked.
1,Erased from my kindle,Life is too short to read this particular book. I'm sure I've read my share of time-wasting light stuff but this one seemed offensively violent after a few pages so....but maybe other readers would feel differently about it.
4,"Magical, refreshing view of love in the dark ages","This movie sets on fire the critics. A lot of them say this movie doesn't worth even the rental. Others think it presents a refreshing look of an overexploited theme: love in the dark ages.Bradamante (Barbara de Rossi) is a shy christian girl who gets to know her fiery side by means of an enchanted armour. Angelica (Tanya Roberts) is - very atractive - moor princess, who gets lost, almost raped several times, but always manages to escape. Orlando (Rick Edwards) and Ruggero (Ronn Moss) are enemies, leaders of opposite armies, and they fall in love of girls of the opposite side.It has great choreographed duels, and strange but fairy-taled customes. The musical score is very poor (electronic, much in use those days), and in some times the action turns to be kind of funny, but is a great movie to see and share."
4,hearts and armor,"As an incurable romantic i enjoyed this movie, it is a combination of old history with a jazzy modern movie score that fits the theme."
1,Dull Bach Performances,"It is hard to be enthusiastic about these performances , especially when superior versions exist. The balances and tempi are usually wrong in Rilling, which is always disappointing. The Suzuki and Gardiner performances are so superior in every way... And for me the clincher is the clotted dull choral sound. One wants to like these performances because the pieces are so good , but instead all that is left is total disappointment....."
3,Captain America the Movie ( late 70s),I think that this is good film despite the fact that it totaly different from the comic i do however like ALL marvel comic movies....i'm too young to have oringaly seen them on TV but i enjoy as a hobby collecting all live action comic movies...i have all the batmans all supermans both flash movies all the incredable hulk movies all the spiderman movies including the live action series i just ordered captain america and captain america 2:death too soon and dr strange. i do however like the 92 captain america better which ihave as well but i think that all the comic movies are fair or better i even taped Generation X and Nick Fury: agent of S.H.I.E.L.D so i would say that despite this is cheesy......it is STILL fun movie and great to watch if you want to just relax and watch an old comic movie
3,Captain America,"Well this made for tv movie is better than the 90's Captain America movie that was never released featuring Matt Slinger. This one at least shows the hero in costume for more than 10minslike the 90's version did. Cap to gets a cool montor bike to ride around. The acting is decent as well. This tv movie is up there with such other tv series movies as Spiderman 70's live action series, Incredible Hulk live action series, Dr. Strange tv movie, Generation X tv movie and Nick Fury Agent of Shield tv movie. If your a fan of Captain America or of superheros check this tv movie out."
5,Captain America Throws his Mighty Shield!,It may be a little cheesy but this one is still much more fun and entertaining than the pitiful straight to video motion picture that was made. Besides this one comes from the late 70s when action films were more fun. I recommend it if you liked the Spider Man movies and the Incredible Hulk television series.
2,Captain America leaps off the comics and into the chezze,"Reb Brown,totaly camp actor from the late 70s early 80s, gives a totaly stiff peformaximum mance as Captain America.The comic book hero from theMARVELcomic books in the 1960s, A real stinker"
2,"Poor movie;low Budget! But, I found it somewhat amusing.","During World War II, Steve Rogers, a gimp US soldier is changed into Captain America, super soldier. He attempts to thwart Nazi Germany's opposing super soldier, Red Skull. Capt fails, ends up frozen... thaws out 50 years later and then goes after Red Skull again. Though this movie was poorly done, true Captain America fans might want to collect this flick anyway. Some of the punching sound effects were cool. END"
3,"Born in '74, old enough to remember this one.","Hate to say, but you guys who reviewed this movie before me got the wrong show. That was the 1992 movie you reviewed. This flick here is a 1978-ish made for TV movie, starring Reb Brown. It came out about the same time as those campy Spiderman movies starring Nicholas Hammond. Anyway. This movie ain't much better than the '92 one. The '92 one at least had the origin right. In this one, Steve Rogers receives an experimental serum that makes him Captain America. He takes on some bad guys who have an atomic bomb. Not a bad flick if you saw it as a kid and wanted to relive part of your childhood, but if you saw it nowadays, you'd think the '92 movie should get an Academy Award."
5,Great Set,"Great, elegant set for reasonable $! Soft handles provide easy and comfortable grip. Strongly recommend hand-washing knives to prevent dullness."
3,Rust Spots,"The blades all have rust spots after having been run through the dish washer. They all still work just fine, but I'm a little embarrassed about handing out the rust ridden steak knives to my guests at dinner."
4,Help For Smaller Hands,"I have very small hands for an adult woman. Consequently, I find every oven mitt too big for my hands, so it's really not safe to use an oven mitt to remove hot things from the oven or stove. I bought this oven mitt as I love Oxo products, and it's supposed to be a petite oven mitt. First of all, I really don't care for this color green. I do like that it's silicone, but it is still over an inch too big for my hands, where there is empty space between my hand and the glove. It's better than most oven mitts you can buy in a store, but hopefully I will find one that fits alittle better."
5,A great sitcom ---,"I have always liked british sitcoms but am careful in what I watch --- mostly I have enjoyed the older british sitcoms like are you being served, waiting for god, keeping up appearances, etc.i tried this because of the reviews --- and they are very much on the ball. even tho this sitcom is relatively new, the episodes are truly funny --- and it's hard to make me laugh...i kept getting the impression that i was watching a british version of the american series Friends --- all the group seem to be upper middle class, work in good jobs (or have no jobs but still survive nicely) --- and get into situations that are alarmingly like those in the american Friends --- which i never watched until it came out on dvd and then i thoroughly enjoyed them.if you like Friends, and enjoy british humor --- by all means purchase this set --- you won't be disappointed!!!"
4,Fun Series,"I really enjoyed this series. It was lots of fun. I would recommend this, especially to those who love British comdies"
5,Great Show.,"Coupling is a great show. Get great laughs out of every episode. Jeff is the funniest character by far, always saying weird off the wall stuff."
5,without a doubt Another Must Buy,"I bought series 3 last week and have watched it 3 times already. Series 3 is another hit, just like i expected. This season the writing did take a direction change, but that only added for fuel to the comedic fire per character. For example,More Couples:Patrick and Sally do a lot of talking. So now we get to see these two interact more. It all works out.Drama:You have what you think is serious, pregnancy test, but then we learn that Jill just grabbed the pizza man for a shag.And of course, Jeff is still Jeff. Everything here works with precision.This without a doubt Another Must Buy!"
1,Coupling Season 3,Product was faulty and was returned for replacement. Received credit instead.J Paul Muxworthy
3,"GREAT SHOW, BAD DVD...","I absolutely love this show and just had to buy it as soon as it came out on DVD, so as much as it hurts me, I had to give it a 3-star rating based on technical merit...the sound quality is just terrible!! You have to turn it way up just to hear what susan says in the split episode while what steve says is perfectly audible...definately a fault with the DVD...oh well..."
5,"WONDERFUL, GRIPPING AND PROFOUND STORY","Once I started this book (which I bought to give as a gift to my sister) it haunted me--and over a period of three days I stole away from other tasks to devour it. Beautifully written and so thought-provoking...the layers that are peeled away, to a core of honesty, made me think a lot about my own life with my family. As a writer myself I was humbled by this excellent portrayal of a family in crisis--and stirred by the resiliance displayed. Strongly recommend."
3,Fun boat if you have time and skill.,"I have had this boat for a couple of years now, and have nothing bad to say about it except: it takes quite a bit of maintenance. You need to oil the drive shaft using 3 in 1 multipurpose oil, which is a pain in the neck to get to the oiling hole. You should also grease the drive shaft using a marine (waterproof) grease. It is even worse to do this! There is little to no instructions on how to do this in the manual :( It isn't all that fast, but I guess it's okay for the money. Overall, I would suggest asking questions at a local hobby store (if they even know anything) before you buy this!"
2,Look somewhere else,"Ok for a starter RC boat, but I think you could do better. For starters the spare battery and jumper wire (which Amaxon recommended) which I assumed added power or battery run time did not even fit the boats harness. After a few minutes of the first run, the boat became very sluggish. I pulled it out of the water and it weighted 2lbs more than when I put it in. Ok end of they run.... I don't have a drill bit in my pocket to drill into the bow as recommended by Traxxis. Not sure where this water even came in... But siliconed the entire seam between the hull and the topside and took care of it. Maybe Traxxis could just do this and charge $2 more for the boat? Next run was better... Until the boat flipped cutting a sharp turn and proceeded to nearly fill with water in the time it took my daughter to run across the pool to get it. Guess it would be too much to seal the engine compartment hatch with a gasket for another $2 considering the boat might possibly be used in the water...."
5,"A Riveting, Imaginative Approach to Jesus' Love for God","Michael Dwinell, in his book ""From Within the Heart of God"", invites the reader to move right into and through the agony and the ecstasy of what it means to surrender oneself to God. He uses powerful and riveting images that ask the reader to feel, to imagine and to explore what it might have been like for Jesus. In doing so, he helps the reader find words and images for the very thing we so often cannot find words for - an experience of God. What happens, of course, is that anyone who reads this book is asked to plumb the depths of one's own heart and one's own relationship with God. Michael's images are unique, poignant and daring. This book is a gift to those of us who are constantly searching for words to match our experience of the sacred......words that are harsh, beautiful, soft, hard, passionate. Michael has a way of using them that is simply captivating."
3,Not One of the Great Ones,"This was just an okay event. I didn't like the whole idea of USA vs Canada as it had a lot of great fighters being booed just because they were Canadian. This event saw the return of B.J. Penn which is the main reason for getting this dvd. You get to see stars George St. Piere, Rich Franklin and rising star Mike Swick. Most of the card is decisions. Two very close fights, but the rest were just okay. The dvd itself is not the best. The picture quality seems off compared to other recent releases. Also, save for the main events, everything else seems to have been cut but the acutal fights themselves. Even the minute in between rounds is gone. I would rather have had it play out like a live event and heard the interviews, the between round talk, etc. Not a must buy for anyone but a completionist."
3,cool,"As a UFC fan, this event had some good fights. I bought it while I was away from home and t.v so I started collecting all of the UFC's. It became just another DVD to the collection."
1,Many problems - should have returned it,"The radio is weak. The CD player skips. The batteries run down even when the unit is not used. I bought this as a gift for my wife. When we had so many problems with it I put it back in the box to return it, but never got around to sending it back. It is still in the box in the closet. I wish I could send it back now."
3,MP3 Boom Box,"We are satisfied with the overall performance of this equipment, except for the poor reception on the FM band."
4,Problems,"JVC RC-EZ35 Portable Boombox with CD Player, Cassette Deck, and AM/FM TunerThe product works great. It took a little getting used to because everything worked backwards from my previous unit. The sound is great. The buttons and dials make it easy to operate. It's easy to carry from room to room. I'd recommend this product. A good buy for the money.After having the JVC Boombox for several months the CD player does not work properly. I try the same CD in another unit and it works fine. What the heck is the problem with the JVC Boombox? Wish I hadn't purchased it."
2,Was disappointed,"At first I thought that this was a great little boombox. I really liked the MP3 playback and mp3 song name display. Then after about 2 days of playing CDs and/or MP3s, they would no longer play. I'd put in a CD and the display would read ""no disc"" even though I tried many different discs. I was very disappointed with the product. Good thing Amazon is so great with accepting returns!"
4,best MP3 boom box under 100 dollars,I had this unit for almost a year now and love it and is simply the Best unit if you want one that plays MP3 cds and simply blows away the completion I also like the remote and power cord fits inside the unit battery compartment (with out batteries of course) the sound is not to loud but acceptable and sound quality is good.there does seem by this page there is some quality control issues with this unit but again it sold very well and often it true that for every one bad review there a thousand good reviews that never get written but that why you should buy it from a reputable company such as Amazon that has very good customer service and return policyyear two and it still working fine on my camping trips beside being banged around and dealing with those rainly days(in the tent)
4,A General Purpose Books about EMD's General Purpose Locomotives!,"I bought this book and I was extremelly happy with it but it has a few Shortcomings. For one it is a book in the self professed ""TRAINTECH"" but not one diagram or technical diagram or drawing of the locomotives can be found. As another reviewer wrote, there seems to be a lot of coverage of current operations w/surviving examples but less of the locomotives when they were first operated. I also feel that there were significant examples of ""Geeps"" that deserved mention and/or an illustration or two. Some examples include CN's GP's w/Flexicoil trucks and a smaller fuel tank, the US Army's GP7L which had a huge Winterization Hatch w/a small fuel tank and AAR switcher trucks which were later rebuilt into another notable unmentioned and unpictured example when they were rebuilt with AAR-B (road trucks salvaged from ALCO RS-1's) and some recieved new cabs and all got chopped noses.Despite the short comings an excellent Volume!!!!"
4,Great reference to have for early Geep modelers and fans,"I found this book very informative, pictorally and factually. It's worth having in your reference library if your a model railroader or fan of early EMD 'Geep' Locomotives. While not every picture is taken by Mr. Solomon, they are all of high quality and certainly useful in modeling after a prototype. Was slightly disappointed to not see the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac's GP-7s (They origially had four, in a very stylized paint), or the rebuilt one still in service today (used by the Old Dominion Chapter of the NRHS and Buckingham Branch RR), I could overlook that for the plethora of other useful tidbits in here."
3,romance literature of another era,"""Mildred"" by Mrs. Mary J. Holmes is the story of a young orphan (or so everyone thinks), and the years as she grows up and prepares to be wed. I can't say that I ever really grew to care about the characters, and the ending is a bit predictable, but, in its day, it must have been quite an entertaining read. Now, however, I would put it in the ""rainy summer day read"" category."
5,"Oh, so real!","Immediately reading it a second time, because I couldn't stand putting it down and read so fast the first time through! Nice work Angie. Thanks"
2,"Get it from the library, if at all","After reading mixed reviews about this book I decided to buy it anyway. It wasn't the worst book I've ever read but it wasn't all that great either. The main character, Renee, was immature and irritating, which it made hard to get into the book since the story mostly revolved around her. And the other 3 charcters weren't very well developed either.The author dragged what was supposed to be a 7 day trip into like 300 pages. And then the book ended so abruptly like she was tired of writing. The women didn't change or mature at all, so I'm not sure what the lesson was supposed to be, if there even was one. I definitely wouldn't reccommend spending money on this book. If you feel the need to read it, borrow it from the library or a friend."
1,What a Bunch of 'Hos'!,"This was one of the most disappointing books I have ever had the displeasure to read. I thought it was going to be an inspiring, and even heartwarming, story about women who strengthened their bonds of friendship during a life-changing vacation in Jamaica. Instead, with the exception of one of the women,it was a depressing and disgusting account of no-class sluts who had nothing better to do on their holiday than have sex with anyone and everyone who so much as expressed an interest. Worse still, the women didn't even like some of their sex partners nor did they enjoy the encounters. What trash - the book as well as the characters."
2,Struck out on this one,"Struck out on this one. I'm usually not afraid of buying cheep stuff. However, no matter what I still expect it to be at a descent quality. This amp works but it sounds crappy and puts out about half of its advertised power. Thought I could hold myself over for a while but all I got was a pyle of crap."
4,Great amp for mounting in my Jeep,"This amp fits very nicely under the seat in a Jeep. It is straight forward to wire with ample instructions. The outputs are bridged allowing you to drive one large speaker or sub off both (full power to one).Two complaints. First, the RCA jacks are on the front while the other wiring is off the back. That means wires coming out of both ends. Makes it a little harder to mount and route wires than if they all came out the back. Second is the screw mounts for the power wires. No way to protect these against the elements. My guess is that this is where the corrosion will occur in the long run. It's a water resistant amp, why not make the connections either protected or able to be sealed."
2,Boogie Blues,"As a huge fan of the Jeff Beck Groups' ""Truth"", I purchased this with high hopes, but apart from Ooh La La, I was not impressed with this collection. Despite what the liner notes say, this sounds like your standard boogie band, the tracks all sound the same. I have a feeling that this material would shine live, but not here. Take a listen to some tracks before you purchase this. A good gift for my dad."
1,Wow... what a piece,"I can't even begin to say how bad this compilation is. Just another piece of evidence against any rock and roll post 1971 or 2. If this is what gave Rod Steward ""credibility"" then he can go to hell. That's my opinion."
4,The World&#65533;s Greatest Bar Band,"What great talent! Rod Stewart, Ronnie Wood, Ronnie Lane, Ian McLaglin, and Kenny Jones, all talented performers, who created for a short while, the world's greatest bar band. Rocking hard and playing loosely this band just seemed to throw things together and hope for the best. Not just a back up band for Stewart, Faces created music for a Saturday night, out on the town, hitting the clubs, and having a real good time doing it. Listening to songs like ""Cindy Incidentally,"" ""Pool Hall Richard"" and ""Borstal Boys,"" you can hear the skill of the band, but Faces always seemed to be more about having fun. This collection is more complete than Snakes and Ladders and you will be hard pressed to find a band that better epitomizes the swagger of good old-fashioned rock and roll. There are many bands that have created more memorable music, but few that sound like they are having more fun doing it."
4,Splendid,"After several go-rounds with Faces' collections on LP, leave it to Rhino to finally get it right.Fans may quibble with the absence of certain tracks, but then again, kind sirs and madames, you've perhaps already purchased your absent favorites many times over by now!For a single-disc compilation by these distinguished gentlemen, ""Good Boys"" will serve quite nicely, thank you!"
1,Not as pictured,I was looking for some of the doorknob covers that have a button on the side. The pictures show that this kit does. . .it DOES NOT. It takes my 2 year olds only a few seconds to pop off door knob covers that are made without the side button. I returned this product and would not recommend to anyone.
1,Outlet Covers are Useless,"I would definitely encourage you to buy something else if you're childproofing. My 13 month-old daughter easily pulls out the outlet covers and plays with them, and the drawer/cabinet locks are not very effective either."
3,to expensive,this is a good product but you can buy the same exact at walmart for $6.50 not worth 39.99
1,DON'T BUY,"This item has not been recalled, but Consumer Reports urges that you DO NOT buy this item due to the outlet covers being choking hazards."
3,History,"This history is educational concerning TR's political and personal life. However, the writing is fairly dry and it is not very inspiring."
4,Great action Figure,First of all this action figure was one of the better action figures out there that portrays Rinoa. Although the detailed of the eyes of this action figure looked sleepy and didn't portrayed the cute/pretty eyes that I would have liked. The action figure also lacks poses due to the limited poses she can do because of her legs. Nonetheless this action figure is highly detailed and can do a wide range of hands/arms gestures which makes up for the lack of movement her legs can do. Overall this action figure is definitely worth the money spent on it. 4.5/5
5,"Rinoa stiffly bounces into figure form,","Rinoa is the cheerful heroine of Final Fantasy VIII, soon to be romantic interest of Squall. She's difficult to pose with her realistic robe/dress hybrid, but the level of detail is ridiculously good. The ""Play Arts"" Final Fantasy figures are a treat to look at and a wonderful item to own."
3,37 year old little kid,I went through piles of wacky packages as a kid. I grabbed a few packs and was quite amused. They are still clever and deliberately nasty. The magnet packs are hard to find. I have bought about 10 packs and only found 2 magnets so far.$2.95 is way too high for these. My local comic book shop had his marked at $1.25.
4,This book is for both the history and mystery fan.,"""Burial Ground"" by Malcolm Shuman is a fun mytstery novel filled with several plot twists that can keep you guessing up to the last few pages. It has many true historical elements and anyone familiar with the area around Baton Rouge and the Felicianas will appreciate the accurate descriptions. It also has a view into the native Indians of the area - their past and somewhat confusing future."
5,Interesting Thought-Provoking Premise,"This is an interesting and very entertaining film, which still holds up well after more than 60 years. The angels decide to bestow miraculous powers upon a common, little man. He can make things change, move, appear, or disappear at will. In addition to providing for some very comedic episodes, it raises some though-provoking questions as to the use of such power.The special effects are executed quite well, and one can only speculate as to what a remake would be like, given today's cutting edge special effects technology. But don't wait for the remake; this film is well worth seeing."
3,Donner party,"I was looking for a Donner party story that I had read in hard copy a few years back and this was not it. This is written by a survivor who is told the details by others to write her book. The first almost half of the book is about the expedition, but the rest is about her life following the trek. I watched the PBS version of the expedition and there were many anomalies, so what to believe.Not a very good read."
2,The Expedition of the Donner Party and its Tragic Fate,The story was very confusing. It kept flipping back and forth from present to past. Not sure I really know the story or if the person who wrote does either. I thought it was going to be more factual.
3,The Expedition of Donner Party and Its Tragic Fate,"This book was a very good read! How ever, the author wrote her story from second hand information, she, herself had no real memory of the horrors the others went through! But, her description of Sacramento, and surrounding areas was very interesting. Her hardship that she recalls at Sutters Fort were disheartening! The author had a comfortable life with the Brunner's after her tragic experience. But, the title of the book, just doesn't fit the story, it should be titled ""The Life and Times of Eliza Donner""!"
5,Good book,"I really liked this book. I like historical stories, and this gives us great insight to what the Donner Party actually went through to migrate to California. Tragic, heart-wrenching, detailed. Great read."
1,Beware buying online.,"I have bought this product twice now from Amazon (different sellers) because I can't find it anywhere else. Both times the product was ""expired"". The wax was all dried up and the strips were unusable. Both times I got a full refund, so I'm not complaining about that.But I would be wary of buying these anymore because it appears to me that the product is discontinued and if you see it for sale, they're probably old.This last time I bought it, one of the packages was so old it was discolored (yellowed with age)!!If anyone knows of another product that works as well as this one (when new) I'd love to hear about it. I've tried tons of others and none work as well."
1,not good,This product is not good. I did not like it. The strips are dry and we have to iron it before using. They mentioned we have to just rub them on our palm before using but thats of no use. Please re-consider about buying this product.
1,Old product,I received this product within the designated time however you could tell the product was old from the faded and crumpled boxes. The product inside was so old that it just crumbled on the strips.
1,Very poor quality,"These strips have the worst quality. I have used these strips before from Walmart. But the ones from this seller were horrible. I couldnt use even a single strip in the whole box. Anytime, I try to peel it, the whole strip breaks."
1,Waste of money!!,"Bought four boxes of these a couple of weeks ago and used one strip last night and couldn't figure out why they looked yellow instead of the regular blue wax. Well, once I warmed them up and pulled them apart I realized that they were old and dried out! And not just that one strip.....ALL FOUR BOXES OF STRIPS!!!! I was so ticked and disappointed!! This is my favorite strip and I thought I was getting a bargain but will NEVER buy then from this seller again!!!"
2,"Sounded like a good idea, but the dog wouldn't bite it",My dog would not willingly eat this unless I slathered it in cream cheese. What is the point of a chewable medication if the dog will not chew it?
3,Met Aida Not the best seat in the house.,"I love Aida, and this production is as usual a thing of beauty. Blu-ray operas are the best. But the camera angles from the pit, looking up the nostrils of the performers, are awful. And the ceiling shots, forget about those too. They are so bad I probably will not buy the Blu-ray of Turandot, for fear of more of the same. I miss Brian Large!"
3,Great show but poor acting,"Grat singing. Singers never reflected at theirs faces and acting movements what was going on. Except for the tenor,the others sang looking at the floor maybe looking for something lost. I think that there is a great differencebetween singing and screaming and shouting high notes."
3,well sung but visually terrible,The main leads are so overweight they can hardly move. On CD it is not a problem but on Blu-ray it just looks ridicuous. The whole thing is far too static and the grand march looks tired. The ballet does not look at all like anything that might have come from ancient Egypt. I will not bother to watch it again. Aida really needs a new recording.
3,It's not as big as it says,"The website and the packaging say that this fits up to 14"", but it does not. Fully extended, it will fit a maximum of a 12""-13"" neck, and for a 12"" neck, it would be tight. For 12"" or larger, you need to order a Medium."
1,DEPRESSING - Almost had to call suicide help line after this,"This is the most depressing book I ever read in my life. It was on a cold wintry day when I started to read this piece of literature. The town was a downer, the characters odd, the plot non-existent. It seems like the murder was just added on towards the end of the book because the author realized there was no story. I know I could write a better book completely liquored up on Jim Beam whisky. James Joyce, Edgar Allan Poe, Mark Twain, Charles Dickens and PLATO STRATUS!!! Yeah right!"
1,Pittsburghese smittsburghese,I'm from Pittsburgh and I found the dialogue overdone. It was obviously a biography of the author's secret homosexuality and drug addiction. He tried too hard and it didn't flow very well. ....
3,dialogue got on my nerves,The story was interesting but the western Pennsylvania dialogue made the read tedious. I live in western Pennsylvania and I feel the dialogue was overdone and to the extreme. The descent into madness by the main character kept me reading on.
3,Interesting...,"An interesting book about a kid growing up in a small town in Pennsylvania. The content of this novel was enough to hold my attention, but I found the dialogue difficult and choppy. However it was worth reading because I think that most of us can relate to the main characters rebelious attitude and emotions. Interesting, but not a ""must read""."
3,Not bad at all,Some of the reviews here are pretty negative but I found the book quite different. I could have done without the heavy Pittsburghese dialect but the book moved along and did hold my attention.
2,A bit overwrought,"I felt the attempt to replicate the unique speech patterns of western Pennsylvania was a bit overwrought; it's possible to convey the dialect without making the dialogue so dense.Aside from that, the story itself was engaging enough... if a bit depressing."
4,Great reasonably priced crib,"We are very pleased with our crib - took the two of us an hour to put together (one of us reading directions and the other assembling). Could have been assembled with one person, I believe. Finish is beautiful and side rail raises and lowers easily. I wanted a spring-foundation under the mattress rather than the press-board, and this crib was not out of my price budget like most of the others. I would definitely buy again!"
2,Just Try to Buy the Conversion Kit...,"We have enjoyed the earlier model of this crib for nearly two years, and now need it to be a toddler bed. The specialty store where we bought it won't deal with Simmons any more, and Babies R Us has a hold indefinitely on all special orders. Simmons has been bought out by Delta, and I've spoken with them directly with no luck. So we have the mattress on the floor and the crib gathering dust (really holding toys) until this resolves or we go to IKEA and start over. Buyer beware."
4,"Maybe it's just me, but...","I would have liked the lowest position for the mattress to be a bit lower. Our son (at 8 mos.) is able to pull himself up and (almost) over the crib rail. He's too tall for the crib, even at its lowest setting. I would have liked to get more use from it.Overall, the quality is good. It's an attractive, simple crib with a neutral color -- which goes well with just about any decor. Being able to wheel it around is a definite plus."
3,attractive crib but doesnt last more than 2 yrs,we bought this crib for our 2 yr old daughter and figured it would last us through at least 2 kids well our second child is aboutto use it and my 2 yr old also uses it for naps well the drop siderail cmae right off the crib tryed to reattached it and found that a piece of it broke into pieces to say the railsarent sturdy enoughtto take a 25lb child weight or pulling and tugging at it. so were off today buying another crib!
1,It SMELLS!,"Really. I am not kidding. We purchased two cribs, a chest and combo for our twins. Although beautiful, there was a distinct chemical smell when we got it out from the packaging. After 5 days, the stench is still there. We've cleaned the furniture multiple times, and even opened the windows to get the smell out of the nursery, but to no avail. I don't know if this is just a freak thing, but we will obviously be returning the furniture as we will not put our babies in a room with possibly toxic fumes."
1,Same piece of footage over and over again,"I am a HUGE Spice Girl fan and buy every book and DVD and CD that I can, but this is just slapped together junk to make a buck. They have one piece of footage of the girls at a snowy photo shoot (the first movie) and some of the girls at an LA photo shoot (the second movie) and they just play the same clip over and over again and slow it down, flip it around, zoom in on it, complete waste of money."
2,Disappointing performance of Schubert,"I bought this CD for Schubert last piano sonata. But when compared with Sir Cliffort Curzon's 1972 performance and with Stephen Kovacevich's 1982 performance -but both are out of print today- ,Baremboim's performance is rather weak even vain. I can say the same for Impromptus D935,again Baremboim is awful ,for extraordinary performance of D935 please refer to Alfred Brendel's 1956 performance (Vox Box 3CD set CD3X 3041)."
4,Super Poseable Gorbag,"I waited a long time for this figure and I'm pleased. I'm glad he is super poseable, that's a nice touch. He has about 30 points of articulation. However, he lacks wrist rotation. He comes with a sword, a dagger, and a webbed Frodo. He has a very realistic and detailed body, right down to the armor and teeth. He has one of the best face sculpts in the entire Lord of the Rings series. I do not recommend this AS A TOY.All, in all, if ya wanna pay the money, I highly recommend him for collectors or Gorbag fans."
4,A really good read,"As ususal Ms Steele has a strong female character, she won't back down or bite back a angry retort.Jeger Urquart has to take care of Lucie his niece when his half brother and his wife are badly hurt in a car accident.Fennia feels she has to help take care of the little one when Jeger is determined to keep the child safe, until her parents are well again.Fennia becomes more of a sub-mom, and Jeger a typical male leaves all the child care to Fennia.Soon Jeger is bringing his women to help when Fennia takes her night off, and Fennia doesn't like that.But Jeger likes it even less when he sees Greville Fennia's half-cousin, is very close to her.When Jeger finds he is in love with Fennia, he puts up a fight to keep his bachelorhood, but it is a lossing battle.The more he sees of other woman, the more he knows Fennia is special.This is a funny book.For writers like this, I recommend Susan Fox, Helen Brooks, Rebecca Winters and the late great Betty Neels."
1,BIOS issues with older systems,"I bought this software to scrub an old hard drive that we were going to give away. It was a Windows 95 Pentium 2 that was at least 8 or 9 years old. The software would not recognize my hard drive (c/ drive). It recognized my a/ drive but not the other. After researching this problem on the iolo website (drive scrubbers home page), I learned that iolo fully acknowledges that the software doesn't work on some of the older systems because of an issue with the older systems BIOS. But you don't know if your old dinosaur is one of these BIOS problem systems until you try and run this software and iolo is no help in updating the old BIOS. And just so the all knowing reviewer from Auburn (who wrote an earlier review in which he assumed that another reviewer was incompetent) knows, this was not a csae of user error."
1,Deserves a zero star rating,"Appears to be a scam. The product never worked and customer service consisted of referral to a supervisor who never calls back. After two months I still don't have a refund after mailing everything back and hoping for a ""restocking"" charge refund.I believe this is a deliberate scam. DO NOT BUY IT."
1,"Customer Support is unreliable, and unable to help solve problems","I bought this product at best buy in New Jersey. And since I have bought it there has been nothing but frustration. My emails and long distance phone calls to india based customer service have been ignored. They are very polite over the phone, they promise you the sun and the moon, but as far as the actual delivery on their promises, they NEVER got back to me. My problem is that at the beginning of the wiping process, the program is interrupted with no error message. I can not get passed wiping megabyte 15 out of 80 megabyte. They asked me to send a system file shot to them so that the senior technical support looks at it and get back to me within 24 hours. So far it has been a week and no news. Calling has not helped yet. I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PRODUCT. I WASTED $20.00 by buying this product."
1,Drive scrubber does not work on Windows 95,"Despite what the box says, it will not clean the hard drive on a windows 95 computer, even when processed through a windows 2000 computer as directed on the box and in instructions."
5,A band who should not have slipped through the cracks,"Scatterfield - 4 young guys from Boston. Energetic alternative rock with a little punk thrown in, and with some Celtic influences. 10 good songs about romance, young love and just getting through life. Worth a listen."
5,Better Than Expected,"Much better than I expected given the small amount of information available. The commentary is excellent but the pictures really make for a great resource. A large number of these images I've seen no where else while researching the Battle of Midway. I'd gladly recommend this book to anyone seeking info on the Yorktown, Battle of Coral Sea, or Battle of Midway.G. Alvin Simons"
5,Catholic Justice: a must,At long last a book that every person can utilize to change their own little corner of the world. The workbook portions are practical and informative. Each chapter builds on the idea of social justice. A must read for anyone who cares about the community and the world that they live in. Thank you.
3,Would be great if it were more durable,"I agree with the other reviewer--it's a great product. I think you're supposed to hand wash the cups, but mine have done fine in the dishwasher. I also bought it for protein shakes and it makes it MUCH easier than using a full blender. The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because mine died after just about 3 months. I think it's because some of the liquid entered the motor unit, which is why I'm not bothering with returning it despite the warranty. I've had some problems with it sealing well after taking the gasket off to clean the blade unit; seems the gasket just didn't fit well after that (and one of the gaskets moved and got cut by the blades while it was operating). But it's hard to clean it well without removing the gasket. Despite that, I'm probably going to buy another one and hope I don't have that problem again because I use this everyday."
3,"Dated, but......","Berlin Wall of Sound is a pretty good representation of the CK's live sound at the time ~1990. Buzzy JCM800 guitar sounds. Over the top lyrics and vocals, but fun stuff. I think they were/are primarily a live band, with an energentic show. Andy, the bass player, wrote the ""Beatles Gear"" book."
5,"Nicely made, great price, stylish.","Just received it but I have a smaller version which I really like. This is a nice, simple, understated soft sided cooler. It is tall but skinny and fits well into the back of the car for trips to the market in the summer months. It also has two small flaps on the top of its lid secured with velcro. You can pull out things without having to zip open the entire top."
5,A Good Introduction,"Cobb Jr. and Griffin's ""Process Theology"" has been my introduction to process philosophy and its theology. Based upon a fast read, I judge my experience as pleasant - informative but not overwhelming. I recommend the book to anyone with a theological interest looking for an introduction to Whitehead's ideas."
3,Really did not do much for me!,"Its okay, but it really did not do much for me. This product ok because it cleared up some of my marks, other than that its ok."
5,Mother's Friend,This product is amazing. I have no stretch marks. I am now pregnant with baby number 7 and am ordering more. Thank you Mother's Friend.
5,So glad its still out there!,"I used this product when pregnant back in 1985/86 (9 month span) and honest to God it worked. I faithfully rubbed it on my stomach every night. I only wish I had applied it on other areas as well. I do not have any streach marks AT ALL on my stomach and I gained 54 lbs!!! I have them on my thighs, breasts and butt but not my stomach. If the formula is still the same I'd recommend this product."
1,smells horrible,"Being pregnant, strong smells and bad odors can be off putting. This cream is so strong and smells almost like baby powder. I couldn't stand it to even use it."
5,worth a shot,"I have heard of many creams and lotions but this has worked so far for me.Alot of old school mothers and grammas have used this where i work and recommended it to me. I have had stretch marks on thighs and a little around the breasts related to puberty growth spurt and was worried i would get them on belly with pregnancy. But so far (7.5 months prego) i have nothing on my belly and other places havent gotten worse. i used the cream and oil, as both are pretty inexpensive. worth 12 bucks to try and see if works for you. Using something is better than nothing. p.s. drink tons of h2o :-)"
1,Biggest vanity mistake I made during pregnancy,"I bought this around 32 weeks pregnant when I ran out of my pricey stretch mark cream. Based on reviews, I thought it to be a budget-friendly alternative that stood the test of time. Boy, was I wrong.First, it smells terrible. I was embarrassed to be wearing it because it smells so strongly-- like a floral baby powder or something. Like something an elderly lady whose nose doesn't work very well would douse herself in.I also found it to be greasy and slow to absorb.Regardless, though, I used it anyway. I figured the stench and grease would be well worth finding a great product to keep my belly smooth. I used it twice a day (sometimes more, NEVER less) and ended up getting stretch marks on my lower belly. I immediately switched back to the pricey stuff I was using before and they faded some, but they are still there. I am ready to deliver at any time and have not gotten any more marks. Stay away from this stuff!Seems to be more nostalgic than useful."
4,so far so good!,"the item says that it will help with stretch marks and prevent itch. i'm not too far along but the stretch did make my skin itch. using the product helped with irritation. when i'm further along, i'll make sure to update. my friend swears this product is great. she only has stretch marks where she didn't use the product. =)"
1,"too easy, doesn't even give a clue","do NOT waste your time and money on these tests, they are too easy and useless"
2,too easy,Those who study with this book shall think that they will score 800 in the test. But this is not the reality. The tests are way too easy.
3,"Good, but stretches the halloween theme","I have a halloween DVD collection going for me and my son, I was excited to see what this one was all about. One of the pro's of the DVD for me is that it was the old episodes I grew up with, not the newer series were they could talk. One of the episodes was a little later, but still what I consider classic tom and Jerry, you could tell that Chuck Jones did it(artist from the grinch), which was enjoyable. The menu includes a nice halloween them, including Jack o Lantern menu buttons, and the back of the box shows Tom and Jerry trick or treating, but there was no such episodes. There was an episode with the witch shown on the cover, and then the rest kind of stretched the theme, like the first short, tom gets tangled in a close line, and looks like a bat for a couple seconds. I picked this up for 5 dollars, so think it was worth it to add to my growing family Halloween collection."
4,READ LONG AGO,"I read this book in the late 80's where I learned to pass my ""duty"" time in the military with an occasional game of D&D. The title grabbed my attention in a bookstore one day, so I purchased it. It was my first fantasy read so I didn't know what to expect. Since then I have read numerous other fantasy novels, many with interesting characters and colorful or grim worlds, but few can compare with NOG when it comes to content that gripps you. If you've never rooted for the villain before, you will here...not so much for him to win, but for him to succeed in finding the light that is hidden somewhere in his darkened soul just one last time. Quite graphic and raw, Mr. Rogers does an excellent job in drawing us a world that's far too believeable. I've since lost the book, but will buy it again somewhere along with ""Zorachus"". Although I enjoyed it alone, I undoubtedly missed out on much content by not reading Zorachus first, so I'll have to get them both."
2,A Biography for teenagers,"This book is for teenagers, it is presented in a very younguish context with illustration and large print. Amazon should actually classified as a children, teenagers reading material. Actually teenagers do not read this type of books anymore, I used to read them in the 70's. Very dissapointing considering I am a serious reader looking for info on a more detailed and technical manner."
5,Don't go to London without it.,"This is the single guidebook that I carry with me to London. It's a very comprehensive collection of useful, practical information for manuvering around the city and its attractions. The street guide section alone is worth the price, since its pictorial format easily covers the city neighborhood-by-neighborhood, and the A to Z locator of streets is invaluable. Although published 10 years ago, most of the general information is still applicable. A new, updated edition would be wlecome."
2,I Don't Know What To Type Here!,The movie was totally not what I expected. I was apalled at the curse words. The actors were good but the curse words literally turned me off.
1,Not a Christian film,I was very disappointed with this film. I am a born again Christian and feel that this film does not represent Christianity in any way. This film is about lesbianism which God does not condone. I purchased this film believing that I could show it to a group of young Christians and couldn't. This film should not be categorised Christian genre as it is not.
3,Not for chinchillas,"I know, it says ""guinea pig house."" They mean it. My chinchilla hated it. There is a DIFFERENT house for chinchillas, so if you have a chin chin, get that one."
5,Great investment for your piggies!,"I bought this for my two female piggies (one three years old and one two months old) who share a large C&C guinea habitat, and they LOVE it! I may have to buy another one, so they each have their own little house, as they seem to like this even better than their Chubes or the little soft nest/bed I also got for them."
4,Hide A Way,Nice little Hide A Way but I would have liked it to be just a bit larger although the big ones are kind of hard to get through openings. The bunny loved it and would go in to have her place where she would be seen but as she got used to it she sat on top of it and would watch what was going on. She did start to chew on it so not sure how long it would last but I would buy it again. She looked pretty cute when I saw her face peeking through the little hole. Your bunny would surely love this one but for this size she was a young Netherland Dwarf so if you have another breed I would recommend buying a bigger size.
2,"They Like It , But I Don't","I bought this house for my 5 female pet rats, i thought it was perfect,spacious to hold them all and they seemed to LOVE it. always playin in/on it. I liked it...until i read the ingredients on the package. Pine wood is the first on the list. one pine is toxic to rats,mice,and generally all small rodents (including guinea pigs) so if they happen to chew it they may get sick (my because some say the processing of the pine kills the toxic oils). But the big problem is, if and when they pee on it, it will cause fumes that WILL make your pet sick. i do not recommend this o anyone with a small pet. get an igloo for guinea pigs or hammock for rats,ferrets ect.Pros:They like itspaciousCons:it will make them sick"
2,Not large enough for a Guinea Pig,"The hut is made extremely well, and the price is right, but this simply isn't large enough for a mature Guinea Pig. My piggies will not go into this hut because it's so small. Upgrade to the extra large version is you have Guinea Pigs!"
5,Best Supportive Book for a VBAC contemplator.,"This book sets out in easy to read format with each section being informative. As an Australian I found the book a positive experience as I have been discouraged by several doctors not to proceed with my plans. After reading this book, I found that I was full of information and could make an informed decision and have decided to go ahead with my planned VBAC. I believe that for anyone considering a VBAC this book would be on the MUST READ list. It took me less than 3 days to read the book cover to cover. However, it took 6 weeks to order it from the US but I'm glad I did."
3,All or nothing approach discouraging,"I read this book expecting some hints on labor positions and other things that would make labor easier and make it less likely for me to have another c-section. What I found was a very all or nothing approach that made it seem that the healthcare profession (doctors, nurses, and hospitals) were against VBAC attempts and only midwifes and birthing centers were pro-VBAC. Since this is definitely not the case with me, I couldn't relate to the book and found myself getting frustrated with the assumptions the author made.While I'm still going to attempt my VBAC, I will do so without the help of this book. I had heard great things about it, and was very disappointed with the overall tone of the book when I read it."
5,A must-have for anyone hoping for a VBAC,I borrowed this book from the library and then had to buy it. It was full of helpful information in educating myself about why a VBAC si so important. It has lots of suggestions for interview questions to use and shy when you are looking for a care provider and birth place. It gave me the information I needed to make others understand my wants and desires for a vaginal birth after my cesarean.
4,Broken Things Fixes the blues,"If you know the history of this performer, you know she has a unique and comfortable ability to convey her style. This is some of the 'old stuff' like a worn-in pair of jeans. The album has a good mix of her talents and is a must-have for fans."
5,FLAWLESS,"I met Julie miller several years ago. She had just put out her first album. She told me in a phone coversation that she didn't drive. In jest she said she had trouble chewing gum and walking at the same time, let alone try to navigate traffic. Well, fortunaltely for all of us driving isn't required to be a genius. I knew when we spoke that there was something special about her. She had an innocence about her like Amy Grant had when she first started out. Unlike Amy since her first album, Julie Miller continues to top herself with each release. There is something about how she delivers a lyric that reaches the depths of human sensitivity. My favorite song on the album is I KNOW WHY THE RIVER RUNS. Don't feel bad Julie, Einstein had problems with shoelaces. Stay off the road but definately stay in the studio. The theory of relativity has been covered. All you have to do is keep singing and people will be talking about you for years to come too."
2,Broken Things,"I find a few pieces on this Miller CD marred by an over-active, loud drum beat. Does that go with her vocal strength, which is less suited to rock and roll than to plaintive folk? Where lyrics count, I'd as soon not have them drummed out."
3,Squeaky Clean,"I bought this CD after hearing one song; Broken Things. The rest of the tracks are good but tend to be a little too repetative. Her voice, though ""nice"" definitely gets blown away by the guest singers she has on the album. Her voice is also a little irritating, she sounds like a cross between Alvin Chipmunk and Olive Oil. A good album but her voice doesn't go with the rock and folky music she sings along to."
5,My Favorite CD of 1999,"This was, without a doubt, my favorite CD of the year, as well as one of the biggest suprises. I'd never even heard of Ms. Miller or her husband Buddy, but they are both now constantly playing at my house. Julie's delicate and evocative lyrics combine with driving melodies and her squeaky-girl voice to create a powerful statement. Why don't we ever hear anything this good on the radio?"
5,a new favorite,"I saw Julie, like many others of you, on PBS. Then I vaguely remembered that Karen Peris recorded with her (The Innocence Mission is my favorite band). So I went out and bought this record on a whim and have bought ""Blue Pony"" already as well. I love this CD. The songs are so beautifully and unabashedly Christian without any of the CCM over produced cheesiness. Patty Griffin and Emmylou Harris (the two best female voices in the world) contribute moving performances and add to Julie's amazing voice (she almost sounds like Cyndi Lauper on some tracks, and that's about the highest compliment I can give). So buy this album if you like any of the artists whose names I have dropped throughout this review."
3,"Horrible Charger, Great Grip for Carpel Tunnel","I have carpel tunnel and this was the only way i could play ds with my son. i still use it as a grip but for a charger i gave up on that part. if i dont get the connector in just right it wont charge and then sometimes i plug it in and it seems to turn off the outlet cause it wont charge the grip or even the ds if i try to plug it straight into it. i have found that we cannot charge both at the same time anymore either. i bought this at the navy exchange here in japan and i got ripped off, i paid $40 for this thing. if it was only 20 it wouldnt be such a big deal but 40 is a different story."
3,"Ok grip, charger, not so good","I bought this so I could play some games like Mario Kart or Metroid without getting cramps, the extra battery was a plus.I can play better when I'm using this and my hands don't hurt anymore, I'm 28 I have big hands.The extra battery was good at first but the position of the on/off switch made it easy to turn it on accidentaly while traveling. I'm not sure if that was the only reason but suddenly I couldn't get the thing to give me more than a few minutes of extra charge.If I had to buy another, I would probably go for wider grips for more comfort and no battery option."
4,Great accessory for your DS,"I'm glad I bought this for my daughter. She plays her DS non-stop therefore, the battery is always dead. It's convenient to have this rechargable battery handy. What's cool is that you can charge the DS and the battery at the same time."
1,Doesn't work,"Wouldn't accept a charge out of the box, battery must have been fully depleted for some time. Actually causes the AC adapter to reset, and I have to unplug the adapter, then plug it back in to get it working again.Since the battery doesn't work, it just adds unnecessary bulk and weight. Also, the DS is still uncomfortable to use, as the drop still doesn't allow you to place your hand far enough away from the controls as to avoid cramping.Would not recommend for any reason."
2,Item is discontinued,"I experienced similar problems that others have described. The charger will stay on charge all day long but give only a few minutes worth of extra power to the NDS when switched to play mode. It also gets noticeably warm, almost hot, in that center battery area while in play mode.I called NYKO for support and was informed that the item has been discontinued. There is no other similar product offered by the company for the NDS. I was offered a measure of credit towards any other product on their web site but the only items for NDS amounted to a light-up stylus and a camouflage carrying case with a matching car charger. Hardly a replacement for a charger grip that would have been amazing for that upcoming 11-hour overseas flight.So I'm out ten bucks because the retailer has no more for exchange. I can either hack the device to try to fix the battery or take a chance wasting another ten bucks for a possible working device. Now where's that tri-blade screwdriver?"
5,Pain Has Made Me Strong by Brandon Paul Webb,"I just got through reading it! ""Pain Has Made Me Strong"" is one of the best Poetry books I've ever read, I gave it 5 stars because it ROCKS!! Brandon Paul Webb really knows what he's doing with his words of wisdom and wonder!!! Mr. Webb definitely has a true gift in writing Poetry and I'm looking forward to owning Volume 2, I hope he never gives up the pen!!!!"
1,And the point is...?,"If only the pain of reading this ""book"" left me anything other than nauseous. Don't waste your time...I trudged my way through the first 50 pages in hope that at least one poem would be worth my $[...] (not including my S&H!) but I couldn't even find one worth $0.20. The author's childlike attempts at imagery and parallelism forces the realization that it is way too easy to get published."
4,Pop art,"I've purchased this DVD to find out what's behind pop art who are its main protagonists and indeed who gets to call it art? The feature is made up by a series of interviews with prominent artists from the 50s and 60s who weren't so well known back then. In fact is a film about Henry Geldzahler who went to the art school with Andy Warhol and became curator at Met during the 60s, Henry introduced artists like Larry Poons, Mark Di Suvero, Andy Warhol, etc to the general public thus enlarging and challenging the established view of what's art. The movie also answered my question - pop art social effect is simply to reconcile us to a world of commodities...banalities and vulgarities which is to say in effect indistinguishable from advertising art."
4,Once you start Reading You will Keep Reading,"I bought the book just to read in train, but once i start reading it i could not stop my self go keep reading and i read all the book once i came back to my room.You learn how people still care about each other and you learn there is no limit when you love someone."
1,Do not purchase these.,"These are of such poor quality. They are made of cheap fabric, like terry cloth cheaply woven that sheds all over the black leather goods I have that I wanted to apply leather conditioner to protect them. I had to use another cloth to get the bits of white lint out of my leather. Why do certain manufacturers use the cheapest materials, over-price their products and never test what they sell to the public? Lexol is supposed to be the expert on Leather care. I waited for these to arrive and it definitely was not worth the wait. Very disappointed."
3,"decent applicators, but they shed lint","pretty unnecessary if you go to autozone and buy a bag of lint free cloths. these are nice in that they provide leverage, but out of the box are very very linty. I will try to wash them as another reviewer has suggested."
4,Easier than a rag,"These applicators make applying Lexol to my car seats very easy. They fit well in your hand, are the perfect size, and handle the product well. Recommended."
3,Nothing Special,"I received these sponges in a Lexol cleaning and condition kit. They're ""nothing special"" in my opinion. I was expecting super soft and nice quality sponges, but they're just a cheap white terry cloth covered sponge. Gets the job done, but you can get this kind of sponge just about anywhere."
3,"Ok, seem to soak up a lot of product",These seemed to work ok but not great for cleaning my heavily soiled leather couch. They seemed to soak up a lot of the product and get foamy at times.
3,Wore out too soon.,"They worked great while they lasted, but their spongy cores wore out faster than the terry cloth surface. About half the life of a normal dish sponge."
4,"they look good, but have not used them yet.",The two pads are thick to get the job done. I have not used them yet---but paln on using them soon.
2,Too small to be any good,"These sponges will slip out of your grip at the first swipe and thereon really tax your fingers because you will need to grip them harder trying to hold on to them. They will absorb too much of the product you are using them to apply onto you car and will require more effort to cover your car. Wish they were larger by atleast 50%. And oh yes, wash before first use unless you like removing lint of your surfaces."
3,"Not Bad, but Fluffy","These sponges work well and will not scratch your leather. However, when I was using them for the first time, buts of white fluff came off onto my seats. I had to brush this off with another cloth."
4,Simply product,Nothing special here. Just a firm pad wrapped in cotton to apply cleaner/conditioner. It washes easily and applies well.
1,Not Lint Free,"Don't do like I did, read the reviews first! It is not lint free and the fibers are easily removed. These are only sown to look like microfiber but are nothing more than cotton sponges."
4,"Good size sponges, that do the job.",Great 2 different size sponges for cleaning and or applying Lexol products. Feels like good quality and durable sponges. A good buy for cleaning and preserving your leather goods.
4,Application Sponges,Great sponges. Washed out easily. Nice and smooth application. Didnt leave any unnecessary fuzz behind.
1,Not worth it.,This product isn't worth the money. The sponge flakes leaving residue on the item you are cleaning. Using any old cloth would do
2,White lint comes off.,I got these to use on my leather clothes and car seat. Very cheaply made. The white lint from the pad comes off and is a mess to pick up from leather clothes and car seat. Go to dollar store and get microfiber cloth !
4,Works great!,"I love putting the lexol conditioner on my couches (well, as much as you can love cleaning) but it really didn't hold well on the rags and I always ended up with a mess. I bought these after hesitation becuase there were such mixed reviews, but they work great! I DID heed the warnings and wash before use. I can say that because I did that, I didn't get any linty mess. After using I throw them in the washer on hot and I haven't experienced any of the falling apart that other viewers mention - they still work great and make putting on the condition MUCH easier so I would for sure recommend these!"
4,Looks can't tell,I have not had time to use this product yet but it appears to be top quality. I am sure they will get the job done
1,consumer beware,"listed is an 888 telephone number to stop junk mail. be careful, as your social security number is asked for- don't give indentity!!!! this author has been on tv- shameful!"
5,Excellent stink,Prepare to carry a baton when wearing this scent - you will need it to beat down all of your new admirers
5,Amazing Illustrations of a Wonderful Concept,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be... a...Chipmunk? This beautiful book looks at being a chipmunk from the eyes of a 4-year-old girl. From the warmth of a cozy den to the harsh realities of weasels and hawks, this book contains full color illustrations that inspire the imagination. This book is a must have for any parent that dreams of their child living in harmony with their surroundings."
1,Dont bother ordering,"Dont even bother ordering...I placed my order as it said they were in stock..days later I got an email saying they were out of stock but would ship soon...a week later I emailed them...a day later I got a response, (or supplier said they wont be shipping anymore so we wont have them any longer)last time I order anything from guidegear"
4,Excellent boots for the price,"I have had the boots for a couple of months now and am completely satisfied with the fit comfort and apparent durability of the product. The 'liner' at the bottom of the boot is coming off, but not a big deal that seems to happen a lot to me so I won't blame the boot."
2,Very Light Duty Boot/Cheap Zipper,I bought these boots for my son to wear at work. I thought the price was right. Now he has one boot with a broken side zipper and it's unusable. So beware. Forty dollars sounds good but the zippers aren't worth forty cents. Cheap and plastic. If the zipper goes then you have worthless boots. It's not like changing a shoelace. These boots still looked new when I threw them in the trash.
3,check it out review before buying,Waterproof for maybe like an hour of walking through 2 1/2 foot snow then they become completely wet.Dont wear to school since they in reality resemble UGS
4,Best boot for the buck,On my second pair and I am very happy with these boots. They are adequately water resistant... last a good long time... handle abuse well and the main attribute is that they wear almost like gym shoes. Very comfy!The only shortcoming for me is the fabric between the zipper opening is short. This makes the boot a bit hard to pull on. My solution was to cut it down the center and sew up the 2 ragged edges...this is time consuming but was well worth the effort in the long run.Gotta say...love these boots!
2,Poorly written and lacking depth,"Although this book is certainly expansive, I can't help but feel that I would have preferred a fewer stories in greater depth. Someone else mentioned in their review that they felt the writer had simply lifted the promotional material from tourist brochures and I tend to agree.At times it felt as if I were reading a promo for Sylvia Browne. I would have liked more evidence that the author had actually been to some of the properties.Finally, the book has a great number of typos, grammatical errors and sentences that simply stop halfway through. I was surprised to read that the author was a former journalist as this definitely needed a strong edit.Some potentially good material here but not enough was done with it."
1,I agree with the first review by the reader from Palo Alto.,"I, too, was disappointed by the book. A tourist guidebook could have done the same. The author had not even visited some of the places she listed. She also stated that she had never even seen a ""ghost"" herself - I find that incredible, after years of ghost hunting!"
5,Outstanding!,"This cable is outstanding. I spent 24 years in the audio business and products like this at this price are a rare find. Its high-tec at a very amazing price.My advice? Not no hesitate, purchase these cables while they last!"
2,so-so,"You're better off buying the cheaper version at wallmart. This one was a little akward to use. I do, however, LOVE, love love my new margaritaville machine. It absolutely rocks."
5,Love it!,Goes with our machine and presents nicely at parties. It is a great addition when using our Margaritaville machine. Highly recommend.
5,Great Product for a great price,"I ordered this product along with the Margaritaville Fiji concoction mixer and its carry bag. realizing the Rimmer and Lime Serving set was sold by an Amazon partner, I didn't expect it in time for Christmas. Low and behold It all arrived on the same day. Awesome experience with this shipper, items as described. will shop with them again."
5,Great buy,"You can't go wrong buying this... it makes salting the rim super easy. The cutting tray is a bit arbitrary, I tried to cut the limes on it and it slid around, but overall it's a great little kit."
2,not worth it,I bought the Margarita Ville machine for a gift and included this as part of the gift. I was told it was Cheesy.
1,It's called a plate...,Why waste your money? Dump some kosher salt on a plate. Does the same thing and doesn't take up extra space in your kitchen/money.
3,okay - had to return,Had to return the entire machine as it was too tall for either cabinet I wish to use it for entertaining purposes. Oh well!
1,Ehhhh.,"Typical Chinese quality item. Missing some hardware, flaky paint, tray has thin sheet metal, etc. Mine was missing hardware to attach the door handle, the cabinet also did not have the drawers as pictured and the tray was bent in two places. I just took a pair of pliers and fixed the bent edges since the paint was already flaking off on the tray and cabinet. I just need it to hold some basic hand tools and small items while working, if you need it for anything more than that look elsewhere."
3,DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH,"Lou Diamond Phillips heads a relatively unknown cast in MURDER AT THE PRESIDIO, based on a true story of the first murder that occurred on the hallowed military base. The victim is the young wife of a military policeman, obviously the result of a botched burglary attempt. Lou plays a criminal investigator who smells a rat and goes outside his perimeters to catch the killer. While the identity of the murderer is fairly obvious from the beginning, the viewer is drawn into the mechanics of how and why, with some solid acting from Phillips and his supporting cast, particularly Martin Cummins as the victim's husband; Daniel Roebuck as his commanding officer; and Victoria Pratt as Lou's love interest. Though the movie doesn't have a lot of fireworks in its unfolding, it's a solid entry and worth a look."
4,Great movie except for J Stu,"You know this is an awesome movie and I would've given in 5 stars, except for the cheesy appearance of J Stu of the Jim Rome Show fame.Stick to radio, bud."
5,Loved It,"I read the previous entry and its right on...the game is very disturbing and very real I might add. I learned much about these psycho-medical methods when I was in college learning psychology...but aside from the disturbing torture descriptions for the faint of heart, all should find some amusement in this game. As a fan of horror I found this game to be second only to Puzzle of Flesh...another fantastic game."
3,interpreting rituals from a multi-dimensional perspective,"Rituals associated with religious festivals (case of Thaipusam among Hindus in Penang, Malaysia) must be understood in the larger macro context of the society. For Collins, rituals associated with Thaipusam reflects the enduring tensions within the Hindu society in Malaysia. More specifically, she argues the class and caste contradictions play a significant role in how the different sections of the society interpret rituals. The author by solely focussing on the internal contradictions of the Hindu society in Malaysia fails to take into account the impact of the role state in Malaysia on the Hindu society. The revitalization of Islam and the pro-Malay policy of the Malaysian state equally play a significant role in influencing the Hindu society."
5,lo amooooo,siempre me gusto floricienta y me encanta este cd. tiene canciones te llegan al corazón!
2,BUYER BEWARE! FALSE ADVERTISING!,"WARNING! This item does NOT come with the ""INCLUDES Y-CONNECTOR FOR UNIVERSAL COMPATIBILITY"" as advertised!!! That was the main reason I ordered this product! Will be requesting the seller send me a ""Y-CONNECTOR FOR UNIVERSAL COMPATIBILITY"" free of charge or I will be returning this product!"
3,NOT as advertised.,"+++Positives+++1) Fast shipping.2) High quality cable, gold plated end.3) Very Cheap but still RCA brand.---Negatives---***Other reviewers information is outdated and wrong, as is the description***1) Not at all the cable that was described.2) It is NOT white and NOT model DT15SB but DH15SB (written on the front package)the wiring has sliver woven look and their are brown plugs at the end withgold tips.3) Does NOT come with any Y adapter like in the description.RCA DT15SB Subwoofer Cable (15 FT)"
3,It's O.K.,"This is a classic DP theme, which I really like the idea and plot, but felt there were gaps. Like...it needed more understanding of the characters, and more depth in the storyline. What was Amanda's mom's secret for Amanda? She never told it. Where was the closure with Jace and Amanda's mom and his mom who knew about the affair as well. What happened to Tess? Terry? The account? The plane wreck and her accident on the horse didn't pan out. The ending when she thought he wanted her as his mistress, again, was just ridiculous. This just seemed a little too hurried or something. It is a one-day reader though, if you want some escape for a few hours."
2,Not What I Expected,"When I saw this book in the bookstore I couldn't wait to get home and start reading it. The book started off with a bang and then took a nose dive. I have never in all my reading seen a heroine as weak as Amanda and I have seen plenty but this was Ridiculous. The Mother was trifling and ""Jace"" although good-looking was mean as hell one minute and honey this the next and if I had to hear about her slender body and hands more time I thought I would scream. Overall I did not like this book what- so-ever."
3,Nothing more than O.K.,"Ive read my share of Diana Palmer stories and always find them to be great. This one however, seems way too rushed at the end. At the last page i was like ""where's the rest?"" Jace is portrayed as emotionally tough, not wanting marriage, etc. and in the last couple pages he does a very sudden turn to a romantic man. A lot of the characters are left hanging and we don't get to see what happened to a lot of them. It's an ok book, but if it was a little longer it might have been better."
1,lint & fuzz everywhere on these french blue towels.,i washed mine three times and spent several hours picking out the lint and fuzz stuck on the towels. maybe i should have stick to white/off-white colors where lint & fuzz wouldn't be so obvious like the darker color towels.
2,Average Towel,"Don't expect something soft and silky. Just average towel. I had towels that I bought from Turkey, they are 1 year old but much better then this."
3,Overall good value but some color fading,"Bought 4 colors as gifts in December when 2 bonus wash cloths were included with 2 bath towels -- a good value for soft, absorbent 100% towels. I kept a french blue and lemon yellow set, and after being laundered only 3 to 4 times, the french blue bath towels are obviously faded compared to the unused wash cloths. The lemon yellow looks fine, but I would hesitate to buy dark colors again after the french blue faded."
1,"Oh, God, This Was Bad","This film was INCREDIBLY bad, easily the worst I ever tried to sit through. The editorial review said that it's hard to imagine a better Quixote than Peter O'Toole? Well, I sure can: his name is Brian Stokes Mitchell, and he at least can sing his own part. The poor man who dubbed over O'Toole, couldn't hit the side of a barn with a good note. The sad part is, I love musicals in general, and so I kept watching this one, hoping it would get better, but finally I just gave up. If ANY musical is in need of an onscreen revival with better performances, it's this one."
2,Man of La Mancha by Peter O'Toole,It was okay. I was expecting more action. I fell asleep on some parts of the movie.
1,A great musical mutilated.,"I first saw this video in a high school Spanish class. It was a fabulous way to introduce Cervantes and this beautiful story. I immediately went home and asked my mother if she'd ever seen it--she had the soundtrack on vinyl and CD. After listening to the original Broadway cast and watching this video again, I noticed a few things: 1) Peter O'Toole really looks the part, but should not be allowed to sing. 2) Ditto for Sophia Loren. 3) I would have missed out on this wonderful music if not for this video, even if I later decided it was a bad movie. It's still worth watching!"
1,"Well intentioned, but pretty bad.","I wanted to love this movie. Unfortunately, the leads lack the singing voices necessary to carry everything off. And for some reason that I can't quite finger the entire production seems stilted. Watch this if you love the novel and already know the show and are willing to make allowances. Don't watch this if this is your first exposure to Man of La Mancha or to Don Quijote."
4,Man of La Mancha,I immediatelly sent this DVD to a friend in Thailand and never opened it because I had seen it before and wanted my friend to view it. It was a gift. I'm satisfied with the delivery of the product.
5,Great Movie!,"This was just what I was looking for and found it here for a very good price. Great movie, fast service, and the item came without any incident. I would recommend this service to all who need items like the one I purchased."
5,Don Quixote... Inspirational!!!,"I watched this video last year in my 6th grade class.. I was really overcome with Cervantes' concept of reality and idealism. It makes you ponder-- ""Is truth found in reality or idealism??""... I totally agree that Don Quixote's outlook on things is INSPIRATIONAL! His quote- ""I come into a world of iron and make it a world of gold"". Life should be seen by everyone like that... Not just the dreamers. Make life what is SHOULD be and not what it is. =-) YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS FILM!!!!!!"
2,It was good at the parts that were funny,"I saw this in class. I really liked the part when he fought the windmill, but he thought it was a giant, he was so funny. The movie would be better if the old man had more fights, he was so funny."
2,Even I Sing Better,"Just as I titled it, even I can sing better. But let this be known, Moose go into rut if I sing. That's how bad it is. Peter O'Toole is not tooooo bad, but Sophia Loren was really terrible. I don't know if someone else was singing for her or if that was her voice, but they both should stick to acting, if indeed they are still acting. I love them both in many of their films but this most certainly was not one of them. I've seen broadway plays of Man of LaMancha and the music is outstanding but this movie of it does not make the music worth listening to. Sorry, I would say a BIG NO to this movie!"
1,"Great story, shame about the casting","Having seen Man of La Mancha on stage in an amateur production, and loving the music, I was very keen to see what I expected to be a very good movie, given the cast.Unfortunately, the cast and direction fail to support what could have been. The stage version allows for some claustrophobia, with constant references back to the fact that it is being produced in jail. In the movie, this is lost.Worse, much worse, is to come. Sophia Loren is expected to sing! Put simply, while she may be able to act she cannot sing, and should not have been cast in a musical. Peter O'Toole makes a slightly better effort, but why not cast singers in parts which require this ability?This movie was a great disappointment."
4,good,It is truely replay the original script. The songs were sung not as goodas the New York Broadway one. I enjoy watching it. All the actors had done their excellent job to show each character.
5,"Touching story, great music","I need only say nine syllables to prove this movie's excellence.Peter O'Toole, Sophia LaurenTheir performances are great, and this is one of the great romantic (not necessarily love, but romantic) stories of all time. Who couldn't get teary-eyed at the plight of an old man, who, in his delusion, believes himself to be a knight of valor fighting evil? Don Quixote's romantic fantasy is something we all wish we had in us.From windmill slaying to singing and dancing, this movie has it all."
1,Region 2 Heading misunderstood,"I did not understand the ""Region 2"" label and when I started to play the DVD for my class - it does not work in my school equipment. I want to send it back."
2,big let down from Broadway soundtrack,"I know Man of La Mancha from the recording made by the original broadway cast, notably featuring Richard Kiley as Don Quixote. I must say that the musical values of the film version are far inferior and deeply disappointing especially in the title role. It is painfully obvious that O'Toole's musical performances are dubbed, which ruins their dramatic impact. What's worse, they were dubbed by a singer whos voice and vocal characterization of the character comes nowhere close to Richard Kiley's original performance. The one highlight is the role of the barber, performed by Gino Conforti, the only original cast member to reprise his role in the film. It is sad to imagine how great this film could have been if more respect had been shown for the brilliant stage production."
4,"Looking for the good in others, inspite of our circumstances'","I have read several books, that referred to this movies. I'm sure many of have been or known anlady such as Aldonza (a bitter,mistreated tavern lady) that has no hope. Then the man Don Quixoteappears and see Alondonza through ..Loving and forgiving eye's.. Giving her a new name..""Dulcinea""which means..""sweet lady"" Inspite of redicule Don Q. still his sees the world through loving and forgiving Eyes.The movie also has the beautiful song The Impossible Dream.. to inspire us all."
4,It is worth having it.,Brought good memories.They are not singers. But it is touching.I would like to have more of these kind avaiable to us.
4,"Inspiring, intriguing, great music","I liked this movie a lot. I think the people who made it had a strong feeling about it, although maybe not the same take on the story that the author of the original, Cervantes, would have intended. The actors playing Don Quixote, Sancho, and Aldonza have great, expressive faces. The music alone makes the movie worth seeing. There were a few seemingly pointless digressions, like the song ""Little Bird"". Part of the ending (not all) seemed a little contrived. The attitude of the movie is hopelessly and unashamedly sentimental, idealistic, quixotic - but that's the charm of the movie, not its weakness. I can't fathom the review that called it plodding and abysmal."
4,Onward to glory I go!,"I love this musical. I first saw it in Spanish class, after we read the book.It was sweet, touching, and at times very funny. I didn't like the scenes that showed what happened to Aldonza--but that, I guess, was the reality of her situation at the time. The songs are amazing, and the acting is right on the money. I was singing ""Man of La Mancha""(I,Don Quixote) for weeks afterward. I'm sure my family thought I was nuttier than Alonso Quijana. But it was worth it. See this movie!"
5,EXCELLENT FILM!!!! DON QUIJOTE DE LA MANCHA,This film was excellent because was restoration to DVD !!!and in my opinion who has the oportunity to read the book DON QUIJOTE DE LA MANCHA knows.I think you can say anything about this film if don't have already read the book.DON QUIJOTE DE LA MANCHA i love it!! because is legate and listen in spanish is better that English
3,Good Product,"I bought the BAG-10 with two BSH-100. The BAG-10 syncs fast with the BAG-10. It has good battery life, nice range, and excellent sound quality. Three drawbacks - first the controls are non-intuitive, the font on the manual is small, and it connect only to one device (BSH-100) at a time."
1,"Connection is hopeless, support non-existent","I could not get this device to communicate with the BSH-100 headset, and it turned out to be a total waste of money for me. There is no customer service or support associated with it - so I would not recommend buying this, nor probably anything from Anycom - the BSH-100 headphones are pretty average too, with connectivity problems of their own. There are similar items from other manufacturers that do the job very well."
3,Current instructions are needed,"It appears that this product is working as advertised, however I'm only giving it three stars because the instructions were not complete. You will need to go to their website and get the current version. The single LED was blinking in a different manner from anything in the enclosed manual. The website answered my questions."
1,It is a fake,"I compared it to the one I bought at Dillard's and it says made in bance, not france. It also does not work. It may as well have been a dollar store mascara"
5,Worth every penny!,"I swore I would never pay more than a few dollars for mascara. Even my aesthetician told me that all mascaras were pretty much the same and not to spend too much money on it if I needed to cut back on something.However, I found myself reading a beauty blog and they reviewed the Diorshow Black Out Mascara . I thought what the heck and ordered some. And I fell in love.I am lucky in that I have lashes that curl naturally, so I've never had to do the whole curling thing. But they are very light as I'm a redhead, so they definitely need some help to show up.Beyond just making my lashes LOOK great, I really feel as though they help my lashes stay healthy. I have noticed that I don't have as many coming out as I used to.Highly recommend. Lasts for at least 3 months for me, but I'm a one-application-per-day kinda girl."
3,Diorshow Blackout Mascara,"I was REALLY excited to receive this product. Diorshow original mascara is my favorite. I decided to give this one a try thinking it would be the same, just blacker or more intense colorwise. I don't see any difference in the color. And it's not as good as regular Diorshow. It's not bad, but I just don't feel like my lashes are as full and long looking with this one. It has the same curling effect, which is nice. I was kind of disappointed. I will not purchase this mascara again, I'll stick with the original."
2,"Careful, her best 2 songs are missing here!",UnfortunatelyI'd die for this dance (from the film Twins)Let me be the one (from the film Renegade)are not on this CD and sadly both still virtually not available on CD.
4,Brings Back Great Memories,"This compilation of some of the best songs from the sadly short career of Nicolette Larson would be a good purchase for anyone into the LA country rock scene of the 1970's. Her songs include great production values, with much use of percussion and funky influences from the Little Feat contingent. But I would still recommend buying her first album too, as it's got some really good songs not included in the Rhino disk."
3,Good Lit. Class Book,"This book was used in my college English Lit. class to help students be more critic of things that they read, whether it be a textbook or a magazine article. Most of the essays in the book have major flaws. The one that I remember the best was written by Dick Clark and was about Elvis Presley. Clark makes the comment that Elvis didn't write his own songs, which is untrue (as blanket statements tend to be). Anyway, Elvis wrote at least 2 hits, one with Vera Matson (Love Me Tender) and another with Otis Blackwell (Don't Be Cruel).Though many of these essays are poorly written, this is a good textbook for developing with critical reading skills."
1,Mirror On America = P.O.S.(negative connotation),"Obviously, most of these writers spent too much time in front of the mirror while blabbing on about nothing, after having read these essays. They go on and write about blatant issues, most of them have too much time on their hands. They go on and blab about nothing. These essays shouldn't be given the light of day. Do not attempt to read or buy this book. Don't even give it a glimpse at the bookstore or library. It is not worth your precious time. It certainly wasted mine, only because I had to use this book for my Composition II course in college. It is that bad, and not worth a single penny. Mirror On America is nothing more than a piece of ""FILL IN YOUR WORD."""
2,broken,"This watch is beautiful and was as impressive a gift as I had hoped, until it stopped working right. The date and time seem to work at will. Now I am embarrassed."
2,Great...for 1955.,"In an attempt to satiate a burning desire to escape, at least mentally, to a tropical pacific island, I have been buying a lot of south seas music lately.The first time I listened to ""Heart of Tahiti"", images of blue lagoons and swaying palm trees did not pop into my mind. Rather, images of my father as a youthful man did.The songs on this 1999 collection are definitely interesting and catchy, but most of the tracks are from the 1950's, with the oldest one from 1943! I get the distinct feeling that Crescendo Records compiled a bunch of Tahitian songs whose copyright had expired.Anyway, if you are a post-WWII soldier enjoying the 50's heydays in the sunny southern islands, this compilation is for you! If not, make sure you listen to the track samples before you buy this CD."
1,wrong shoes,"they did not mail me these shoes, they shipped ones that had laces. I kept them anyway, and the shoes are nice. However, it's not what I orderd."
5,Perfect Hide Out,"My hamster loves this little house! She drags paper tissue into it to make a nest. She uses the door and the window hole to go in and out. So far she is uninterested in chewing the wood but she does climb up in the roof (and occasionally pee). I really like this house because is sturdy, not too big/small for a Syrian hamster and I like that the walls are wood and not plastic. It blocks out light, which I think my pet appreciates most of all. Highly recommended."
5,Perfect Hide-out!,"We got this for my daughter's hamster who had grown bigger than all of our previous hamsters! This is a perfect size for her to be able to go in, turn around and burrow if she wants to. It is too large for a traditional hamster cage however as the base is about 8"" across. We bought this after we changed to a larger cage and it was just right. I like it because it is made of a non-treated, plain wood so no need to worry about her chewing on it (chemicals, paint etc.)"
1,Save your money,"If you are looking for a collection of ORIGINAL Spike and Tyke cartoons, like I was, then do yourself a favor and do not, I repeat, DO NOT order this because you will be sorely disappointed. I am a great fan of these cartoons and thought that it was wonderful that a collection had finally been released but this one is about 80% NEW, poorly animated cartoons and contains only one original Spike and Tyke. I hope the company does release a thorough collection of the originals one day but until then....don't waste your money on this !!"
4,This isn't available anymore? It was so good!,"The library had this video so we got it to watch and it was about the funniest thing I'd seen in a long time. I've watched it twice since and enjoyed it even more. Lots of stuff about their life interspersed with clips from their movies and stuff. There's not a whole lot to say about a documentary but I recommend you to get a hold of it if you can because it's really quite good, actually. ; )And I thought some of my other reviews were brief."
5,A great Marx Brothers primer . . .,"Anyone who may not know the Marx Brothers but would like to would be advised to watch Marx Brothers in a Nutshell. It contains some classic scenes from their movies and great interviews. It shows you their still utterly unique comedy, why it took their early audiences by storm and why it still endures. Must see 'Marxism' . . ."
2,Not what I expected...,"This documentary was mediocre at best. There were some ok interviews. There were some very interesting footage that I had never seen, especially the ""I'll Say She is"" footage that I enjoyed very much. (It seems some of the jokes used in ""I'll Say she is"" were recycled for ""Monkey Business"") But overall the content was superficial at best and the clips were repetative. They really did not go too far into the interesting parts of the Marxes vaudeville days and they develved very little into the personalities that made those men tick. I enjoyed ""The Unknown Marx Brothers"" better.081605"
1,Not good for currency and bank notes,"Bought 3 packs of these and ended up very disappointed. The pages looks rigid in the photos but when I opened it, the plastic pages is very soft, unlike the Lighthouse Vario 3C ones that I have. Now I'm stuck with 300 pages that I can't use for my bank note collection. If you're a serious banknote collector and do not like teh notes to bend / folded, avoid this at all cost."
1,This is not a toy!,These 3 pocket currency and coupon binder pages work great for my coupon book. The coupons fit right in and with the top opening I can put 2 coupons per pocket. I shared some with my daughter and we need to order more!
5,Great!!,I use these pages to save my tickets from hockey games (go Devils!!). Works like a charm and the tickets actually do not slide around like I thought they would. Very cool!
2,This product did not fit,"I used the parts finder to order this product, but it still did not fit my truck. On the upside it was easy to return."
3,"A lovely, warm little cookbook","This is a very nice little comb-bound paperback written by an Amish woman, and filled with her family's favorite recipes, and some warm comments about their faith. However, it is currently selling for over $40 plus shipping - which is utterly ridiculous. For that price, you'd be much better advised to purchase a few of Maria Adams's cookbooks, filled with tried-and-true Amish and Mennonite favorites which were collected and tested by the author. I'm not putting down Ms. Yoder's book; just pointing out that it is a small book which was never intended to sell for big bucks. Although I liked it very much, I would have been much more impressed if the recipes were preceded by brief descriptions explaining why the author considers them special. JMHO."
1,ZERO MAC SUPPORT,"Intuit treats Mac users as second class citizens. I bought Turbotax Deluxe 2003 for the Mac. I installed the Federal return CD, but could not get the ""free"" state download. Repeated calls and emails to customer service resulted in the advice that I PAY FOR MY ""FREE"" DOWNLOAD, and then seek reimbursement. I've been using Turbotax for 4 years, and have always had problems getting them to honor their rebates, so no way am I going to trust them to reimburse me. Their claim of a free download is fraudulent."
1,Foreign Tax Credits,"Do not buy TurboTax for MAC if you have to use theForeign Tax Credits section!!! The software consistentlycrashes whenever the Form 1116 has to be filled outand the Intuit support is completely clueless.If it is too late to return the product to Amazon,call Intuit at 1 800 446 8848."
2,"Over 2 hours to download ""updates""","Good luck if you have a modem. Even after a 2 hour download of ""updates"" I still can't file my taxes because they still (as of mid-Feb) don't have the update for declaring children's income on the parent's return. The IRS website clearly says that this can be done with form 8814, so what's the hold-up? Big waste of $50."
1,Don't expect to import '02 TaxCut data!,"Despite assurances from TurboTax customer service that I could import data from last year's TaxCut (ever try to manually enter years of depreciation?), I found that he forgot to mention the details. You have to find a PC computer with PC TurboTax, import the TaxCut data, then transfer that file into your Mac for use. Just a slight omission!Now after having no other choice but to also purchase '03 TaxCut, I can honestly say I'll never buy an Intuit product again..."
3,Intuit a/k/a Stickit (to the Consumer),"Apparently, loyalty means little to Intuit. It offers virtually no support (and what it does offer, you have to pay through the nose for). To boot, it exacts a premium from Mac users without any justification, other than it can. Sadly, Microsoft isn't much better; however, if Microsoft would make a Mac version of ""MS Money"", Intuit might feel the heat. ""Money"" is a better, more user-friendly product than Quicken. Further, if MS made a Money for Mac, ""Tax Cut"" would be a natural competitor to Turbo Tax. Intuit has allowed Quicken to become a bloated program that's larded with bells-and-whistles that are often useless. You listening Bill G?"
1,Some interesting insights....but based on faulty assumptions,"I found the book to be an endless and somewhat unnecessary attack on classical theism. Her notions of pauline theology, based on a platonic dualism, have been shown to be baseless. The disparities and divisions of the church and society are not proven in her work to stem from classical theism, but are assumed. The church which she diminishes has worked to bridge culturally created divisions, which she fails to admit to. Her pandering into pantheism and panentheism are also disappointing, for she reveals her true intention of not reforming the church, but espousing a new religion."
4,Very Informative,Great book. Very useful if you do this type of work. I'd like other suggestions if anyone else knows of others on this topic that are helpful.
4,"Not bad, but buy it only if you can't wait for DT8 releases...","The entire selection it's not bad, especially on disc one, where it features 3 examples of that sort of ""new-style trance"" typical of Darren Tate production (Reflections,Hold me till the end,Tomorrow never comes) as well as other big anthems like Super 8 vs.Dj Tab's Helsinki Scorching or Alone from Above & Beyond - but I strongly reccomand the purchase of Tri-State if you are A&B fan...-. On the second disc only a track is worthwhile, that is alex Morph remix of Nautical Imagery's Distant Dreams. I'm not a big fan of Mike Koglin, to be sincere...In the end, if you can't wait for the release of DT8 album's Perfect World (where there will be all the mentioned track plus Winter and other, it should be released on January, according to latest news...)you can buy it, otherwise there are others better trance selections around."
1,Not even worth a star,"I bought this ring because it was cute and the few reviews it had were great. I got the ring relatively fast like 2 days after i ordered, but I didn't even have the ring on for 24hours and my finger started to turn green. That is NOT ok since it is supposed to be sterling silver. I have only had this problem with one other ring I bought off of amazon but never again will I buy from this seller. I am returning the ring and going to get my money back. I wouldn't have even given it a star, but I had to give it something in order to write my review. I never write bad reviews but that is how upset I am because the ring was beautiful."
4,For Small Kids (3yr-5yr olds),"I use to play this game when i was about 5. I don't even know where it is now but i do remeber it. Its good game for sure. Its not like just a game where you play and ""rot"" your brain like some little kid games. It does have activities where you have to pay attion and a few puzzels. But kids that are 6 would finsh it fast and it would be easy for them. If i did this game now i would probly fish it in five minutes.But overall it is a good game for little kids and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was b/c its not long and you can fisnh it fast. so it may not be very much fun after you finish it."
4,DANGEROUS!,"UPDATE: This torch has become unusable and dangerous. It should be recalled.I purchased this torch in Feb. 2007. For the first few months it was working well. I gave the product 4 stars in my review because it worked so well. HOWEVER, the plastic can and does melt. It could possibly get to the point where the butane feed system is compromised and that could be seriously dangerous - fire and/or explosion hazard. I stopped using the torch before it reached that point.I am very disappointed.This torch is a good idea and if the construction were better (much better) it would be a great chef's torch.Unfortunately, this reviewing system will not allow me to change my star-rating of the product. I would have to drop it to zero stars because of the potential danger."
2,Not happy,I wouldn't waste your money on this product. The flame the torch gives off is very inconsiternt. You have to try to ignite it several times. Definately not worth the trouble I would recomend trying another brand.
2,Buy A Long Leash,"This product is not worth the money. I had it installed professionally which tripled the cost. The collars are poorly designed. I have two labs and it is very difficult to get the collars on them. The buckle and snap are not positioned well. The snap is on the side which makes it somewhat difficult to remove the collar and is useless when it comes to putting it on them. The ""comfort-fit"" is not exactly accurate. If you leave the collar on for an extended period (and you will after a few times of trying to put them on), sores develop on the dog's neck.Currently my fence has been ""out of order"" for several weeks because I don't have time to find the wire break. I could reinstall the whole system in the amount of time that it takes to find the break. There must be a better alternative on the market. I just wish that I would have found it before buying this one."
5,The Best Turkey,"After 26 years of cooking turkeys, I finally cooked one that everyone including myself loved. It's the cider-brined turkey in this book which is as good as the authors say. I also made the great pumpkin and goat cheese gratin which is delicious. Now I'm sorry I didn't make thw whole meal from the book. Everyone at our Thanksgving table wanted this book for Christmas."
4,Best Recipes,This series is great.Don't be put off by the boring format.Not one recipe tried has been less than it promises.I like them so much I've bought them all.
1,Over rated !,"After preparing four recipes out of this book, lamb, polenta, torte and blood orange salad, I think the editors forgot to try the recipes they included. I better choice for those interested would be to subscribe to Food and Wine!"
1,000001,"I did not like this book at all. Felicite was so flat and without, sense, heart, or any real emotions. There was no caring or love to her character at all! I don't like rape, so I didn't like Morgan either. The only character in this book that had any heart, caring or gentle emotions was Ashanti, and she was killed off by the author. Book was a real downer for me and not worth the read! It went into the garbage can graveyard, where all the 0-1 star books go!"
1,This is the worst camera I have ever purchased!,"I've had a terrible experience with this camera. I've only had it for four months and it's already broken. Let me just say that it never worked well to begin with. At least 1/3 of my pictures are not in focus. I thought that it was just me holding the camera improperly, but I set the camera on a stationary surface and used the timer to take the picture. The picture was still not in focus. The date is forver resetting to 1994, and the last straw happened today when I opened the camera to remove the roll of film which I thought was finished, but it never advanced at all. When I opened the camera, the film was jammed in the take up spool and a square piece of plastic fell off of the back of the cover.After doing some research, I went out and bought an Olympus Stylist. I hope that Pentax will honor their product and refund my money. Heaven knows that the IQ Zoom is a worthless piece of junk."
3,I wish I had spent a little more.,"The only reason I am generous enough to give this camera a ""3"" is because it is my own fault for not spending more and getting a better camera to begin with.When my son was born 15 months ago, I wanted a simple camera that I didn't have to fool around with. My husband has a nice SLR, so I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a second camera. Now 15 months later, I wish I had. My basic complaints: focus not great; film advance is horrendous (I usually have to cut the film at different angles just to make the camera advance it); centering subjects is often a pain.Needless to say, I am going out this weekend and buying a new camera. I wish that I had listened to what my father always told me: ""Buy the best you can in the beginning. You'll be thankful later."""
1,Don't believe the hype!,"I bought this course hoping to be able to use it to catch my wife's infidelity. Well, after 2 months of following the tapes instructions- I still have had no luck and no results.... Nothing! The only thing that seems to happen is that I get a pounding sensation in my ears. While they state this is 'normal', I do not get any of the added side-effects, like the much-lauded 'remote-viewing ability.'The more I listen to the tapes, the more clouded my mind seems to get- and this is not what I bargained for! I wanted 'remote-viewing abilities!' (Now all I seem to get is 'clouded- mind abilities.' )Well, hopefully soon I will be able to use my abilities to catch my wife in that act- but until then, I'm giving these tapes only 1 star!!!"
3,SG Hardcase,"This case is ok for the money, not as sturdy as the $90 cases I looked at when at Guitar Center, but I guess you get what you pay for.A little flimsey, kinda like a glorified chipboard case but a little fancier. Better than a gig bag but I would not ship my SG in it or pack it in the trailer with band gear, if something a bit heavy falls on it you might have a problem. But if you only have $50 or so and your guitar is in a gig bag, definitely buy this unit."
5,A great case,"I like everything about the case. Well build in every way Love it, and I recommend this case.... five stars!"
4,great for the price,"this is a 50$ case... keep that in mind. but if you really need one and are short on cash; this is a good case. just keep in mind if you go on the road with it; pack it toward the top. will not hold up well if amp, rack, or cab crushes it. but worth the money."
1,Huge waste of time,"This has to be the dumbest and most retarded piece of wasted time ever offered in the movie industry. I was extremely disappointed. I am sorry I wasted my money on this one. It will for sure be back on ebay - if I can do more than give it away. It is put together in such an awkward way with such a terrible narrator/director that by the end of the first 15 minutes the viewer is well nigh a psychotic breakdown. This is just stupid accentuated by ridiculous in a steamy vat of manure. It's not funny, it's not interesting, and I would rather watch Teletubbies - its much more entertaining. Gets my vote for the worst movie ever and should not be sold for money - ought to pay us to watch it."
1,Avoid!,"This is a cynical piece of work, designed to cash in on the growing interest that currently exists in the Bigfoot myth. It markets itself as, and I quote from the blurb: ""an alarming film that includes exclusive video footage (a man in a $20 monkey suit, exclusive) in depth commentary (depth as in puddle deep!?) and an amazing (amazingly bad I assume?!?!) collection of spellbinding (lol!) interviews with real eyewitnesses"" A ""real"" collection of half wits who make the Cajuns from Deliverance look like Nobel laureates would have been be more accurate! All in all this is a crass, amateur piece of work and complete rip off. Do not buy if you want to see anything remotely interesting or revealing about the Bigfoot. This ""abominable"" creation has absolutely nothing to do with Bigfoot, and everything to do with exploiting and poking fun at Bigfoot fans. Shameless!"
4,A Great Southern Gothic,"Being from the South, I loved all of the southern gothic characters, including the snake handler, the sheriff, and especially, the lady in the country store! A great, fun movie!"
5,Plug & Play - No Short Circuits!,"Are you shorting out your speakers or receiver or setting off sparks because your bare wire speaker wires are hand wound? These `banana plugs' are great. Simply insert your speaker wire into the plug and the mini-allen wrench allows you to tighten it at two points (not just one like most). The plugs then will fit into almost ANY receiver jack or speaker jack (instead of wrapping the wire around a jack or trying to insert the wire grouping into a jack's hole). They are not the cheapest, but they are the best and will last a lifetime. You will never short out your speakers or receiver again. Simply plug and play - it's that easy and worth it!"
4,A good book but don't forget order your CD,"I bought this book because my friends told me this one is the top preparation book for TOEFL test. Yes, it's pretty good in organization. The only problem is that it's not sold together with CD so that when I place order, I forgot to order CDs with the book. In addition, because IBT is based on Internet that require a computerized platform, the biggest disadvantage of this book is that it didn't simulate the true enviroment of test. So you should consider to buy another one to practice test."
4,"Best TOEFL book, but be careful! The Audio CD's don't come with the book","Be aware that you have to buy the audio CD's necessary for listening separately (another $ 40). That is the only reason I gave 4 stars to it and not 5. This book is probably the best source for TOEFL test. I got a very high score in TOEFL by studying this book as well as the ""essential words for TOEFL""."
4,most reliable book,"It is the most reliable, most complete and most helpful book for TOEFL exam. 4 stars for the book and delivery. 3 stars for packaging and shipment!"
5,Number One!,"Having seen all the other iBT TOEFL material out there, I would strongly recommend the DELTA series, particularly because it is user-friendly. It is conveniently and clearly laid out, and the listening passages are separated on individual tracks."
2,Be aware !! Audio CD is not included !!,"Unfortunately,seller does not provide complete detais about this product, so when I received the book.I realized that the package DOES NOT have audio CD which is essential for book's exercises.In the other words, book without audio is junk"
4,cartoon doctor who adventures are good fun,"BBC america shop needs to thanked for bringing this out in this region.At first there was some doubt wether we would ever see this dvd available here. Many fans went to the bbc america shop website and recommended this and it made a difference. This is a fun cartoon adventure for the whole family which is worth buying and adding to your doctor who collection. After all the classic doctor who stories and newer doctor who are family friendly too. I would suggest going both to the bbc doctor who site and the bbc america shop site and asking for further unreleased cartoon adventures that are provided from the online doctor who site as well. There is even a cartoon adventure of a version of the doctor played by richard e grant. Anyways if you love doctor who you will enjoy this cartoon version of the newest doctor , and the price is very affordable too."
3,"An entertaining watch, but a bit thin","The story was entertaining but the plot was kinda weak. It definately seemed geared more towards children than true fans of Dr. Who. My Children love this video by the way. It runs like a Doctor Who version of 'Treasure Planet,' only not as good. There is very limited intracate thinking like you see in the shows.I certianly hope that the makers of Doctor Who continue to try this media, but come at it with the adult viewer in mind."
4,Animated Episode of Dr. Who for the Younger Set,"I enjoyed this animated feature. It was a nice story with a great cast (Anthony Head, Giles of Buffy fame who has done several episodes of the new Who series as the villain). The animation was top notch. They matched the opening of the show beautifully. I would love to see a full episode animated for the adult set, although this did touch upon the unrequited love of Martha for the Doctor briefly at the end. It was better than I thought it would be. There are many extras on the disc including animation trials and behind the scenes interviews and voice over recordings with the actors (which I love). The Dr. Who staff really does a great job of giving fans behind the scenes info that we just love. It also showcases just how great David Tennant is with voice work. I miss him greatly in the new series. I think it is a great edition to the Who collection and I hope they do more of this type of show, but lean towards the adults more."
2,Below 9 or 11,"Showed this to two kids (one 9 and one 11 yr old) who are Who fans. They both said afterwards:""It was ok, but the real Dr. Who is the best."" So maybe this is for even a younger crowd than I thought."
3,An Ok additional story for Dr. Who,This is an OK story for Dr Who. I assume it was considered too expensive for film so they used animation instead.The main problem is that animation forces actors to over act a bit and the actors are already very expressive so the voices just go over the top.The animation style is great though.
4,Almost Fantastic.,"Not quite up to the standards that one would expect from Doctor Who in terms of writing, but on the whole a brilliant cartoon.Some of the dialogue was a bit stilted and the storyline doesn't quite hold together. But it was obviously aimed at a younger crowd, and logic was occasionally cast aside in order to keep the action going. The animation was quite good and took advantage of the medium, using imagery and characters that would have been almost impossible to create (for anything less than the gross national income of Brazil)in a live-action show.An excellent first attempt, and I look forward to the next feature."
4,A fast and utterly enjoyable read,"Like wacky plotlines? How about a cast of characters living on the off-side of the morality, honesty, and decency? A bit of volcanic violence? Then there are fifty books you could read. What sets this book apart, and what makes it one that you should read, is the quality of writing that Carnahan brings to the table. This is not just another comedically twisted tale of crime and revenge. Carnahan's wonderfully evocative prose and clean, no nonsense style strikes me like a Raymond Chandler for the new century. But there's really no mystery here. If you like the first couple of paragraphs, buy the book - you'll enjoy it - but only for a little while because it reads so fast you'll be done before you know it!"
5,David Icke,Thank you for having this book available. I enjoy David Icke's work very much and appreciate all of his efforts to imform us of what is really going on in this crazy controlled world!
2,Good luck with this one!,"Is it that the film is foreign or just badly produced and edited? It's a trip, for sure. If you can buy it on the cheap, it's worth a look. Just set your expectations low."
