1,Mastered too slow,"This CD duplicates the tracks on the AVIDJazz CD ""The Electric Years,"" but you'll notice that the tracks on this CD are longer than the same ones on the AVID CD (and on other sets with the same tracks). Why? ""Django's Blues"" was mastered too slow. There is a noticeable pitch difference between these tracks and tracks on correctly mastered CDs. Get ""The Electric Years"" instead. You'll be giving up the second takes of ""I'll Never Smile Again"" and ""Gypsy with a Song,"" but you'll be getting a second CD and correct mastering as well."
5,Great and Easy to use.,"I use these at the Campus and here at home and they work great. I use them at home for the kids. Everyone has their own HDD and if they mess something up it doesn't effect the rest of the family. The price of the units and cases was more then worth the time and aggravation of having to re-install the OS or fix any problems. Now I just re-image the HDD for whoever messed theirs up. We do the same thing at the campus, if one gets messed up, just re-image it."
4,Worth seeing,"This movie is well put together, and offers us a glimpse 9though movie is fictional) of governments corruption through power, especially in Latin America (though the US is not immune)."
3,convenient but falls apart,"this item is great for holding things that otherwise would most likely be rolling around on the floor of my car, but it is not put together very well. after having it about 2 weeks, my son was kicking at it with his feet and the stitching on the pouch came undone. it was like, all you had to do was pull on it and it came right off. things that are made to be around kids need to be more durable."
3,sold it,"I used this for about 2 weeks. It held a lot of small toys and books but if you put books in it, the bottom of it hangs off of the seat and doesn't stay tight against the seat like it's suppose to. A small tub on the floor behind the seat works better and is easier to get stuff in and out of."
2,Needs improvement...,"We bought this for storage of items while on the go as well as a seat protector from our toddler kicking the back of the seat. I could tell when I took the product out of the package it wasn't the best quality but we figured it would do the trick. When my husband went to install it he said the strap at the top that secures it around the headrest should have had more velcro so it would be easier to attach. He ended up wrapping it around several times until it lined up. With in the first week of having it the big pocket in the middle ripped, the stitching was very poor quality and with my toddler rubbing her feet on it a couple times it didn't last long at all. So now it has a ripped pocket that we can't use. Next time I will spend a little extra money to get a better quality item. One more thing...I have found that most of the mesh pockets are so small that I can't get much to fit in them. Small toys, sippy cups etc do not fit. Bummer!"
4,Pretty nice~,"Bought this just for basic things that I hated throwing in my glove box. It's nice if you're usually driving alone too cause I twist it around so it's in the passengers seat so that way I can put my sun glasses and phone, etc in it. Really nice :)"
4,nice way to clean up your back seat,It's got a variety of compartments and is sturdy. What else can I say? Works well.
3,"great pockets, pity about fastening","The pockets are very useful for keeping my 4yr old's stuff organised in the car. But it doesn't stay in place very well - the lower fastening allow the pad to move around, allowing his muddy feet access to the seat (which was the main reason for buying this product). I bought the one from Eddie Bauer for the other seat, and it stays in place very well, though only has one mesh pocket. So it depends on what you want it for."
2,cheap and flimsy,"Holds little, doesn't attach tightly...the picture is deceiving as far as how much it will hold. I was disappointed."
4,dual purpose,"I bought this to protect the back of my car seat and as a place for my 6 year old to store things during a long car trip. So far so good. It fit the car seat no problem and stays in place. I haven't put too many things in it yet, but there are lots of varied pockets to choose from when I do."
2,Very flimsy,"The car seatback organizer is very, very flimsy. It was not holding up and stuff are falling off the organizer. It was not designed to be on the back of a seat - maybe it is designed for a specific car model? I got an Accord and don't work at all. Waste of money."
3,Okay organizer - decent seat protector,"I really struggled to find an organizer that would help keep the back of the SUV from looking like a toy box exploded in the back as well as protect the seat back from little feet. This does an ok job of both. Some of the pockets seem to fall open a bit, and doesn't hold too much. My daughter is 2 yo and has just starting kicking the seat in front of her. So far the organizer has held up ok, but I am not sure how it will last. For the price it seems to be doing a good job."
1,Ordered twice received wrong product twice,I placed an order for two Sunshine car organizers and was shipped Diono Stow n Go organizers.The Diono is now selling for $7.99 a piece and was not a good product.It never mentioned anything about a refund in the difference from a $14.99 product to a $7.99 product.I called and returned the Diono's and was told to try again to get the Sunshine Kid organizers.Ordered again and again was sent the Diono product.I have the Sunshine Kids organizer and wanted another one.Clearly Dainty Baby which is were I was told it was coming from has a problem.
2,substandard,I like that it has a lot of pockets and an adjustable velcro strap at the top but the bottom is a string that you tie together and it doesn't work very well. The material is kinda thin and overall very flimsy. not happy with this purchase but i guess i should've have known because of the price.
4,Like it,"Irish it had the snap buckle closures, instead it's got a string on the bottom & Velcro attachment on top. Still fits well if our can get string tight prior to tying. Like the pockets in it, thinking of getting another one cuz like pockets so much."
2,not satisfied !,Is not as spacious as it looks in the picture.The top Velcro belt provided does not give a good fit. Overall not impressed.
3,ok,"This is an ok product. After putting it in our van, I realized it's very basic. Not much to it. It does get the job done though."
5,FANTASTIC FICTION,"Having had only limited exposure of Dickson before reading this, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of all of the stories. Adventure scifi is my favorite and Dickson excels in creating mini worlds, plots and characters that are believable and great fun. Each story offers hope for humanity in the millenia to come. I highly recommend this book.I only wish Baen Publishing would stop the annoying habit of placing horrific cover art on their books. The pictures on most of their books in general, and for this book in particular, have no reference to any story in this excellent book and may dissuade readers away."
3,music mail order,I received the cd very quickly. It was in perfect condition. There were various prices listed for the same cd. I chose the cheapest price for a new copy.I ended up with exactly what I wanted. The K-scope songs on the disk were what I was after. I personally don't care for any of the other music on this disk.
3,Slightly Odd Take on Magical Powers,"Roland is instantly suspicious when his English teacher, Mr. Hudson, asks him to spy on one of his less popular classmates. But he has no choice but to go along since Mr. Hudson has proof that Roland was shoplifting.When he gets closer to Jess Ferret (his target), Roland is instantly aware that something is very different about her, but he doesn't know what. He is sure that there is some kind of conspiracy involving Jess, his teacher, her missing parents, and a magician who haunts his dreams in a recurring nightmare.This book is sometimes irritating to read due to the authors overuse of italics and showing us the characters thoughts (with repetitive questions like ""What's going on? Why?"" that quickly become annoying). It's certainly different, and it's not a bad story, but there are other books about discovery of magical prowess that are far more rewarding."
3,Pretty Good,"This was an interesting book and it kept me turning the pages. I liked the author's style of writing and I felt that she had done her research into Victorian times. She was amusing at times and I really enjoyed how she told the story from each different character's perspective. One reviewer said that the two girls would never have been friends in real life but I believe that they would have. At five years old, all kinds of things attract kids to one another and the fact that these two girls had such a different upbringing was pretty irrelevant to them. As a kindergarten teacher, I see this all the time. I felt that I was not only entertained in this book but learned some history as well. I enjoyed Tracy's writing enough that I now have her first book ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" on hold at the library. I do recommend this book. It is a fast read and a good story."
5,Beautiful and absorbing,"I don't care what the critics are saying; don't listen. I have not read Ms. Chevalier's first novel, so I don't know how ""Falling Angels"" compares, but standing on it's own, it is a gorgeous little book. Writing with sparing artistry and eye for beauty, Ms. Chevalier draws her characters with such simple perfection that you never notice the characterization process until you realize suddenly that you know the cast better than you know your family. You never want the end to come, but when it does, it strikes exactly the right chord, poised between nostalgia and indifference, between the desire to preserve the past and the certain knowledge that the future spins on, regardless. A fast read, but this book is well worth your money."
3,Not As Good As The First Book..,"Having liked ""Girl With The Pearl Earring"" so much I was looking forward to Ms. Chevalier's latest book. My opinion; and yes, I was comparing it to the other book,clearly the better of two. I found the charactors in this book a bit flat and rather sterotypical as well as the monologue format tiresome after awhile. And the ending;I sensed some symbolism at work,but of what? Is it that hanging around graveyards is bad luck? Kitty was the most interesting charactor and I wished the entire book could've been focused on her;she's the only charactor that truly changed her life,while everyone else stayed essentially the same from the first chapter. I do think Chevaliers' one of the better writers out there so I will read her next book and hope it's better than this one."
4,Falling angels,"The book starts off with the death of Queen Victoria and already it is apparent that Maude's Mother is lookin forward to change. Two familys who barely get along (just for their daughters, Maude and Livy) have different views on the future. The book start off slow but bye the second half of the book i couldn't put it down. Insightful on how the women's movement can affect their familys."
1,"Missed the Boat, Missed a Century.",Actually it was rather like going down with James Cameron's Titanic. I found this book very disappointing and contrived. The stories unbelievable and exposed every metaphor used in soap operas and movies. I was sorry to see so much time wasted on writng such a misguided book. Tracy completely missed the idealisms and feminism in turn of the century England. It played out more like Sex and the City.A waste of time.
2,Just a bunch of cliches,"I agree with the reviewer who said that the constant switching of narrators led to confusion and that the characters are not well developed or interesting. The characters are all cliches. There's the oblivious father, the neglecting mother, the prudish, disaproving neighbor ... And as another reviewer pointed out, the lesson seems to be that women who dare to have interests outside the house will necessarily neglect their families and will pay for it."
2,yawn....,I typically loved historical novels but this one was a snoozer. Totally uneventful until the end--and then bad things happen to the only characters you can actually like! The constant change of voice was too choppy.
1,Falling Angels: a 1900s Soap Opera,"The problem with writing a great first novel is that the second is bound to disappoint. And Falling Angels certainly does. My fondness of Girl With a Pearl Earring compelled me to fight the impulse of putting Falling Angels down when I felt I couldn't take another minute. While the author did an amazing job of relating the story through numerous narrators, the story itself was not compelling. Picture Days of Our Lives in the 1900s and you've got a pretty good sense of what Falling Angels is about. Don't buy the book. If you want my copy, you can have it."
1,Disappointing,"After reading Girl with the Pearl ear ring I expected a good read. This was choppy, jumping from one character to another, difficult to follow at times, and the ending seemed forced. One character did elicit sympathy, but you don't inside any of the men to understand them. Our entire book group felt let down."
2,"Heavy on Symbolism, Light on Intrigue","I had high expectations at the beginning of this novel, but I found it very disappointing. The characters never quite take flight and become real. While each chapter is supposedly voiced by a different character, if you didn't read the headings, you'd hardly notice the differences in style. Lavinia and Simon are flat and cartoonish. Kitty and Maude are almost interesting, but the most compelling characters (Jenny and Richard) are given cameo appearances. The pace of the book is very uneven, and I grew weary of all the heavy-handed symbolism and unbelievable coincidences. After the tedious parade scene, the crime almost seemed thrown in to generate some drama. I really wanted to like this book but it simply didn't capture my interest or the excitement of the era."
5,"""Absolutely loved this book!!!!""",I could not wait till bedtime to pick this book up and read on. It was written so well and kept me wanting to know more. This book was fantastic and I would recommend it to everyone.
1,Falls flat,"I agree with a few others here, it imparts a limited sense of the struggle for the vote, but the story itself is flat."
3,Interesting Style but Disappointing Story,"Only one star for the story line but two more for writing style.The story begins on New Years morning of 1901 somewhere in the suburbs of London and follows two little girls, their families, some house staff and a few other characters (who may or may not have known how deeply interrelated they were to the others) for about 9 years. I wasn't impressed with the story but I liked how it was written. Each chapter was dated. January 1901, December 1901, March 1903, etc and then those were divided into subchapters. Each was written in first-person with the ""I"" being a different character each time giving their own viewpoint of what was happening at the time.""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" was much better."
5,Love the book!,Book was in good condition with only a few scratches. Was pretty fast delivery and a good read!!
3,Bad story nicely told,"It is not nearly as good as Girl the a Pearl Earring but nevertherless it is not a bad read. There are a lot of characters but they don't really express different oppinions, just tell what happened next. Because of that I found it difficult to get attached to any of the characters. I gave three stars for Chevalier writting style. Even though the story was not that great she still managed to tell it beautifuly."
2,Falling Angels,"I was so disappointed with this book! I loved her earlier book, Girl with the Pearl Earrings and expected to enjoy this one too but I did not. The characters in her earlier book were so real that I found myself caring very much what happened to them. The characters in this book were all self-absorbed and unlikable. I was fasinated by the art, the descriptions, and history in Girl with the Pearl Earrings but this book just did not measure up to it."
1,Repetitive snooze fest!,"""Get on with it!"" -- my mantra during the read. Let's have nothing said over and over by 6 boring characters! If you've read anything post-Victorian in your life, the ""interesting facts"" will seem trivial and the story will continue to remain plotless. A waste of time!"
3,Insight into history,"Boy, a cemetary as the lead character! This was the way our book club handled the discussion of this book. We were able to tag each character with how the cemetary affected their lives. I liked the short bursts of narative in the small chapters. There was much to discuss regarding the customs of the time and the role of women. How the marriages worked out - or not - was quite surprising.We left the book wanting to know what happened next."
4,A good book,"I enjoyed this book; it wasn't the kind that you read over and over, or the kind you tell all your friends they have to read, but it was a good story. Tracy Chevalier has a talent for writing many points of view and voices, and she manages to weave quite a bit of subtle irony into the story without it feeling contrived. My only negative is that when I finished the story, I didn't have a concrete sense of the point she was trying to make. Don't get me wrong though, it was a beautiful story and I recommend it."
4,A Victorian view of womanhood,"Reading the reviews of many, I agree that the characters in this novel are not very distinct. Still I thought that the feeling of the novel pervades, in that it displays the limits that are placed on women and the sacrifice they have to make to become independent. Death seems to be punishment for rebelling against the prevailing thinking. I was intrigued by the importance of paying respects to the departed and how remembering them plays an important part in daily life. The persons in this novel are as ""brainwashed"" in what is right as we are probably today. That I thought was the real impact of this novel. Who knows what our great grandchildren will think is ""right"". A fine book."
5,Could not put it down!,"I enjoyed Girl with a Pearl Earing well enough as an audio book durng a long car ride so was willing to give Angels a try...Wow! The author's rendering of the dynamics of life in Edwardian times surpassed my expectations. She cleverly used the interactions of two families, their help and the staff from a nearby cemetery to convey an excellent view of the politics and society of the time. Kitty Coleman, vapid beauty turned raving suffragette, acts as a catalyst to a story that erupts, winds down and gives closure to the first nine years of the twentieth century. I look forward to Tracy Chevalier's next book."
2,What is the point of this book!,"I thoroughly enjoyed Girl but this book left me asking ""why?"". It was depressing and a waste of time. It gave me bad dreams the night that I finished the book. Disfunction, neglect, infidelity, need I go on?"
2,Disappointing second effort,"I very much liked Girl with a Pearl Earring. The writing was restrained and displayed an authentic voice. But Falling Angels was a disappointment--I realised after about 60 pages that I had no real interest in the story or characters, all of whom came across like twentieth-century retreads of Edwardian stereotypes. So I skipped to the end to see what narrative point all of the build-up had been heading to--pretty predictable stuff."
1,Don't Bother,"This is a story that takes place in a graveyard and that's exactly where this book belongs. After reading a flurry of good books, my good run came to an end with this disaster. The characters were stale, the narrative kept switching from person to person which could have been interesting but instead perpetuated the slow movement of the already snail paced plot. My biggest gripe was...WHO CARES? The novel was devoid of soul and leaves the reader without interest for the characters. Someone died and I barely blinked. Her historical perspective was poor as well, the setting was too weak to transport the reader to that era. I don't know why I finished this at all."
2,Depressing,"I very much enjoyed Girl with a Pearl Earring, The Lady and the Unicorn, Remarkable Creatures, and to a lesser extent, Burning Bright. However, Falling Angels is my least favorite Tracy Chevalier novel so far. The ending gave me a nightmare! Here I am, up at 3:00 AM writing this review, if that's a clue. The last third of the novel takes off in a direction that seems to come out of nowhere. The tragedies towards the end are very upsetting. Dark or grim novels are OK by me if they are done right (Sarah Waters does ""dark"" well). This one seemed to be grim for the sake of shock value, or because the author needed something to stir up the final chapters. On the plus side, I learned a lot about Victorian cemeteries and mourning practices, as well as the suffrage movement in London during the early 20th century. However, I wish I'd not read the whole novel. Now I'm off to have a warm milk or something to get to sleep..."
4,Good read,"If you would like to learn about the life of women at the beginning of the millenium - read this book. I think a good ""go-with"" is The Awakening by Kate Chopin. She writes of the same era but - her book was written at that time. It is interesting to see how Ann Tyler follows the same pattern - but adds to it our modern sensiblities."
1,Wrong product,"I got an audio casset, not a book as I thought I ordered. How do I get the book. Exchange?"
2,Educational yet disappointing,"My husband brought this book home to me one afternoon upon the recommendation of our local bookstore. At first blush I was very surprised they would recommend this particular book. The plot revolves around a cemetary after all. Kind of morbid (I wondered what he was trying to tell me). I will tell you that there are good points and bad points to this piece of literature. The last few years I have seen an increase in the style of writing I will call character jumping ... a couple of pages from the point of view of, or about, a certain character. Then jumping onto another. Truthfully, it drives me crazy! This book is particularly guilty of that. Writing in this way doesn't allow for strong character development. On the positive side, I learned a great deal about this particular time in history and enjoyed that. I haven't read her first book, but if it is written in the same style, I'm not sure I will."
4,Fallen Angels,"I picked up this book after reading ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" (one of my favorite books--truly wonderful!). I also enjoyed Fallen Angels, but it seemed almost not finished...i wish there was a sequel! I kept on wondering if anything would happend between Simon and Maude later (i realize there are strong class barriers, but, nonetheless, since Maude is so forward thinking, who knows what could have happened?)...and four years down the road from the end of the novel WW1 would begin...it just makes me wonder how this would affect the characters."
4,An interesting look at a distant time,"This book is highly intriguing and deftly written--not as much so as ""Girl With the Pearl Earring"", but I look upon that as something a writer is likely to produce once in a lifetime. Some plot choices here seemed too easy a way to neatly wrap things up.Nonetheless, there is much to be marveled at and enjoyed here. I await Chevalier's next book."
4,"Not ""Pearl Earring"" but Still Excellent","The problem with writing a first novel that does as well as ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" is that readers will expect the same quality of writing and plot the next time. Although Tracy Chevalier's ""Falling Angels"" is not equal to her last effort, it is nonetheless an absorbing story involving vivid characters and events. Chevalier does not shy away from major themes such social status, adultery, an rearing children, and, like her last novel, she weaves history almost effortlessly into the plot. Despite unnecessary shifting of point of view among the chracters, ""Falling Angels"" was still a great read. Highly recommended."
4,Left me wanting more in a good way,"I must admit I am biased towards Stanley, so I was very glad that this dvd was available. There are some great performances here that all of his fans will enjoy. One thing I noticed, was that some of the guest seemed to be a bit intimidated or unsure at times as to what they were supposed to contribute or to just what extent they could go, but I was impressed to see Stanley encourage all the guest to just enjoy the moment and just jam! I thoroughly enjoyed this dvd! I didnt give it a 5 because I am hoping for a follow up which I know will be even better! Highly recommended!"
2,A big disappontment!,the dvd is too short with music content. The songs are edited and even the Lenny White song is excluded from the dvd even though it is listed on the cover. I have been a Stanley Clarke fan since the RTF days and was waiting patiently for this release but I guess I would need to wait some more to see if there will ever be something release from Stanley that is better than this.
4,"Good, but short",I enjoyed the video. It shows a great performance by Stanley and others. It was a little short. I was expecting more and did not read the length.
2,1200 pages for the topics covered,"The authors of this book must get paid by the word. They will write 50 words where only 10 are required(I have other Wrox Books with the same problem). The breadth of coverage is good, but its unusable due to the amount of reading it takes to get the information. If this book were 500 pages with the same coverage it would be a 4.5 star book."
4,Good book,"I have only reached the 250 pages on this book, I woould say this is by far the best C# book that I own. I do agree that the book is verbose. Most important thing is that the subject matter is covered extensively."
5,Gaither Vocal Band Reunion DVD Volume 2,This is one of the best Gaither Vocal Band DVD's on the market. The best of the best voices and the moving testimony by Michael English will make you cry with sadness and joy. I'm so glad he's back. I would rate it higher if I could. A must buy for all GVB fans!!!!
5,gaither vocal band,I own both volume 1 and 2 and I loved them. It was nice to see everyone sing together and got to experience the unique voices of the past band members and current singers and also to see them all sing these great songs together. awesome music and gifted singers.
1,gather Reunion vol 1 and 2,I was very disappointed with the DVDs. Both of this were defective in that the sound missing out very second or so.
4,Sharing faith,"I gave this four stars, because it is so casual; however, this does not bother me personally. I like this very much, and was just as happy with it as with the first GVB Union, (volume one). The interviews are informative, so that we know something about their struggles and joys/The fellowship is touching, and seeing people really feeling their faith is encouraging. Once in a while we need to just bathe in it, so we know how good it is. Then when times are hard, we have those good times -of sharing good stuff- to remember. Mickey"
1,AAAARRGGGHHHH!!!,"My eyes are bleeding!! AAAARGGGHHHHHHHH!!! Oh god make it stop! Make it stoooooop!! Barney needs to be drug out into the street and shot, along with the people who made it!"
2,UUUUUGGGGHHHH!,"I am sure this is a good show for my toddlers to watch but it made me want to remove my eyeballs with a dull spoon and eat them. How was this ever popular? There are plenty of other good programs that you children and adults can both enjoy.If you want your kids to learn to say please and thank you: Say ""Please and Thank you"""
1,Not strong enough,"I wish the carrying bag was made as strong as the car seat, but unfortunately, it's not. I've now gone through 2 of these, each one has only made for part of a trip and died. The first bag had the shoulder strap holder tear loose from the bag while in the security, the second bag had the seams bust apart in two locations and the zipper pulled off the track.For those interested I managed to salvage some portability of the unit by purchasing a luggage strap from target and using it to strap the folding seat closed. Then I used one of the shoulder straps from the case and fastened it to the the nylon eyelets one side of the chair."
2,OK,"I only traveled a 2 1/2 hour flight. When I went to pick up the car seat from the belt, the handle broke. The bag kept in place but without the handle what's the use. I can't imagine if I was going across Europe or wanted to use this more than once."
2,"great idea, but did not hold up to travel!","Purchased 2 of these bags to go with the carseats for a recent trip...after one flight and on the way to the gate of our connecting flight one of the straps ripped out of the bag, rendering the backpack useless, but we were able to hook it to a different side and use as a shoulder bag for the rest of the trip. On the return trip the zipper pull pulled all the way off of the other bag, and I had to rip the zipper apart to get the carseat out.When these worked the backpack option was great, made carrying two carseats through security and the airport almost a breeze. BUT they did not seem to be made luggage quality to hold up to the rigors of travel."
1,"Good idea, but poort quality","I like the idea of carrying your carseat on your back in a backpack, but this product is not well-designed. Even after my husband and I folded our Radian 65 down completely we had a very difficult time fitting it in this bag--it was as if the bag were designed for a different seat. The zipper broke as we were trying to get the carseat into the airport. We ended up having the airline put our seat in a plastic bag and checking it with our luggage. We threw this bag away."
1,This bag is the worst,"Yes I have a radian 65. First trip with this bag, seam broke at the airport. Strap broke within a few hours. Company did send us a new one but I don't anticipate it will be any different. And we followed all instructions. Don't buy this product."
1,Form-fitting nightmare,"While I looked for this product exhaustively and was so excited to find it, I'm sorry that I spent the extra $60 now (I had to buy 3). This product is form-fitting and has no markings or instructions to tell you which way it fits over the car seat. If, like me, you just think you can tug the zipper up over the carseat, you'll find that you are not only wrong, but you'll blow the zipper and the seam, leaving you with nothing. Skip it and just check the carseat in with your luggage if your taking it on travel...."
1,VERY LOW QUALITY--DO NOT PURCHASE,"The first time we used this on a short 2-hour flight one of the backpack straps broke off, making it a lot harder to carry. The second time we used it, the other one broke off along with one of the zippers. The idea is great, but the quality is VERY poor---please do not buy it!"
1,HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE OF ANY COMPANY I HAVE EVER DELT WITH,"Our story is no different. Bought the seat, bought the bag.... bag riped on our second use. Called the customer service, asked for a replacement bag within a week before our next trip. Said it would be mailed. No bag arrived 3 days prior to our departure and called again, and got the run around that they couldn't ship it as their office was moving. I asked why it wasn't shipped before their 'so called move' when we initially called and got no answer. (BTW, how hard is it to throw something in the mail?). We left lugging the thing through the airport by hand. Worthless customer serivce! Buyer beware. I wish there was an option for -5stars."
2,Still undecided on this one,"We ordered this seat carrying case for our cross counry trip. The very first time we put our son's seat in it, the seam ripped and the whole side was exposed. When we checked it to board our flight we removed the straps like you would any other piece of luggage and upon return to us, the place where the clip to the strap fits in was ripped off. We have requested a replacement case but have not used it yet. If it is anything like our first experience, I would not recommend this product. It is a good idea and I can see how this could be a nice way to transport this rather heavy seat, but I think they should re-design how they reinforce the stitching around the strap clips and the edging."
1,Had to return,"I had to return this item because the description did not indicate that it was for a specific type of carseat. I was quite surprised when I opened the package. If you don't have this brand of carseat, look at another manufacturer such as graco."
3,"Not too bad, but certainly not great.","The Tchaikovsky on this album is good, very good, but the Sibelius is somewhat mediocre. I have other recordings of Isaac Stern, and they are quite good, but a master of violin can't always get it perfect, and the Sibelius concerto here makes that obvious. Much better, in my opinion, is the recording with Anne-Sophie Mutter, and even better is the Heifetz (although the quality of the recording isn't that good, it's still a great performance)."
4,A lot of theory,"If you are looking for a book to help explain why teaching grammar in context is important, this is a good book. I wanted a few more examples in it. I found it paired nicely with The Grammar Plan Book (Weaver) and Mechanically Inclined."
2,very familiar......very disappointing,"There used to be a sense of ""must have"" with these Hottest 100 compilations...but this has been destroyed in the last couple of years. I mean if you really wanted Madison Avenue, Bloodhound Gang, Macy Gray, etc, etc, etc, you'd buy a Hit Machine compilation wouldn't ya? Even the more ""alternative"" songs are disappointing...Grinspoon, Frenzal Rhomb, its all the same really. Why not include some of the more interesting and obscure tracks from the Hottest 100 list??? And whats the point of chucking on stuff like Fatboy Slim's Praise You which everyone's sick off and have got the CD anywayThe best track on this double is Sonic Animation's Theophilus Thistler, which is a shame coz i already got sonic's CD. Overall...hmmm!"
3,very misleading!,"Well, it is not about Physics. Unfortunately, my physics teacher recommended this book to us, thinking it was about physics, we have to read a physics book, and I started it. I was very unsure that it was about physics, and now I realize that it has sooooooo little to do with physics. What will I do now? It is a pretty good book, although i have read almost 150 pages of it.. it is very interesting, it give a large view on christmas, explanining it. Although a lot of it is obvious, it introduced some ideas and things that I would have never even though of before. THis is definently not a physics books. Now I just have to figure out what to do for my physics book project due next week, any ideas?lol:-)"
5,Oh what fun it is to read,"about one horse open sleighs!This is a great little volume for those in love with Christmas - and with science. It isn't intended for scholarly pursuits, but for some good, fun reading."
2,So-So,"A bit of a disappointment. While ""The Physics of Christmas"" had some interesting science material and some bits of humorous writing, to me, it ultimately didn't have quite enough of either."
2,not happy with the quality,"First of all - I had problems opening the package - it was sealed so tough that I had to use scissors - so be careful when opening.The stencils are nice but made out of very thin plastic. The figures cut are not fully ready to use since you have to take out the details in order to have the holes.Anyway, as Xmas is coming I will use the stencils as they have beautiful cuts that could be used as decoration.Maybe if they have made it ready to use it would have been better though."
3,"Decibels are wrong, but no big deal really.","1. When sound volume is INCREASED, the display of decibels goesDOWN (and dB display goes up on decrease of volume)UNBELIEVABLY the tech support at Panasonic believes this is correct!!!! Really doesn't affect the unit, though. I'm basically pleased with it, other than that ANNOYING feature."
3,Two problems,"1. When sound volume is INCREASED, the display of decibels goesDOWN (and dB display goes up on decrease of volume)2. Panasonic technical support (it took 4 weeks to reach) maintains that this quite in order, in ""true mathematics""One worries what else did the designers get wrong (possibly the counter on the tape player ?), and what would happen if one reallyneeded tech support."
4,Good to learn the product. Insufficient for the test.,"I took and passed my MCP (70-210), but I got the Exam Cram to go with it. This book helped my learn the product, but was sorely lacking in the test area.Overall, I would recommed this book for anyone wanting to get the MCSE, but only as a starting point."
2,Find Another Place to start,"Unless you have the two plus years of experience, or your own Win 2K lab, I would start with the ""Jump Start"" guides, and the inside scoop for Windows 2000 Pro. The MCSE is an undertaking for the new be, and using these books alone is like tying to learn how to drive a car by opening the glove box and reading the owners manual."
2,windows 2000 core requirements,"This set of books is of limited use. There are a great many problems with the books that make it extremely hard to use as a study tool. They updated this book with ""NEW"" information but did not check it or the fact this changed the page numbering. So the Index and ""go to page"" are all wrong."
4,15% coupon expired,"The listing promises a coupon for 15% off the testing fee, but when the books arrived yesterday, Feb 5th, 2004, the coupon had expired on December 31, 2003."
2,Written by an editor or an MCSE?,"I have read the Windows 2000 Server and Professional books so far. Both books lack organizational ques which would greatly aid in understanding the more complicated issues. Definitional statements in the beginnings of new topic areas are always lacking and seem to be written by some editor who took a random statement out of the technical material- they seldom define or give clarity to the coming paragraph. Graphics are pretty good and pictures of MMC screens are helpful although small and hard to read. With some paragraph identifications, Example: I.A.(1) and some attention to organization these would be better books."
2,"Read the Book, Study the Book then Flunk the Test","Not very well written. Other Microsoft Press books that I have bought in the past were much better. It seems that it is the main point of these books to confuse you on basic concepts, then not tell you anything that you really need to know to certify. I think MS is starting to hire writers rather that computer specialist to author their books. I passed my test but it is a good thing that I did not rely solely on this ""official"" study guide."
2,"Okey, but not deep enough.","I have read the four books. They are very helpful if you are new to the Windows environment and/or have basic computer skills. However, I would not consider the books informative for anyone who is MCSE 4.0 certified and for system/network admins."
2,"Just Another Manual, Not Good for Exams",I bought this training kit for MCSE exam preparation. It turned out just like a manual to Windows2000 and the contents have little related to the real exams. It's a waste of your money if you are targeting for the exam preparation.
2,A Mixed Lot OK for 210 and 215 but NO GOOD for 216 and 217,This book has all the imformation that you require with some hands on experience for the 70-210 exam. This book has most of the information you require for the 70-215 exam with a lot of hand on. The only problem is that I am now busy with 70-216 and have found the book badly lacking in content. As an ex Network engineer and MCSE NT4 1998 (Passed all exams first time all from self study) I feel that I was awnsering more questions in the exam from my experience than from the content of this book and that the book was a waste of time and money. I have looked at the 217 book and have now purchased other books to cover 216 and 217. Sorry Microsoft but this is not upto your normal standard even if your normal books are rather unexciting they are normally complete.
3,5 Mile Creek VHS Vol. 2,"Tape had been played so much it was stretched and music was slow, then normal, then slow - a little disappointing. If it's that used it probably should be discarded, not sold."
2,Good but not that special,"This small book has 4 short stories, 3 of which have been publish before (of which I think I had previously read 2) and the fourth is new. They were ok to read but none go into any depth nor advance or further explain the Pern story, so I can not rate the book very high. If you really like the Pern concept spend the bucks for this fluff; otherwise save your money."
3,Filling the gaps,"This slim volume is nowhere near as fascinating as Anne McCaffrey's full length Pern novels. Its worth is that the 4 stories it contains serve to fill in gaps in the overall picture. The stories are short and somewhat simplistic but present a view of Pern not otherwise dwelt on - children hoping to impress dragons for example. Not quite a book to add to one's library but for all Pern fans, a nice set of glimpses. I only wish Anne had focused on some other Pernese professions - maybe the Healer Hall (2 of the 4 stories are dragon-rider oriented)?"
5,More Dragons,Another excellent Dragon Riders of Pern book. Those who like this serries will find it a must read!
5,A fine introduction to a fine author,"Having never read any of Anne McCaffrey's work before, I didn't know what to expect with the small volume which is a collection of four short stories. Knowing nothing of Pern, I still found myself able to understand the world and the people in it thanks to her writing style, which is explainatory, but not overly so. I will definitely read more of her work. The stories were suitalbe for teens as well as adults."
5,Not to be overlooked,I discovered the world of Pern after reading The Littlest Dragon Boy in a Jr. High text that I was teaching. I Lovedit then and still do. The 3 other short stories in this book are just as as delightful and worth reading!
2,Unimpressed,"I love fantasy, and this was my first experience with McCaffrey. I was unimpressed with the stories and the writing. There was very little conflict to speak of, and the writing was 90% ""Telling"" and 10% ""Showing"" with a lot of examples of what I consider 'author intrusion.' I also found her overuse of adverbs to be annoying. All these things that basic writing How To books advise against distracted me to the point where I found it difficult to just enjoy the stories."
3,Fascinating Short Stories,"I pick this book on a hunch at a bookstore while I was visiting friends in Oakland, Ca. When I realized that it was a series of short stories, which I don't care for, I thought I would be disappointed, but as it turned out I really enjoyed this book. The stories are appealing and the characters are very interesting. Overall, the book was worth the money, but I'll stick to full-length novels."
2,yet another bundle,Anne's stories of Pern are enchanting. But I loathe publishers who bundle one new short story with several old ones just to sell a book. Why not commission a full book of short stories? Or why not sell the new story as a small paperback for a buck or two?
4,"A good read for those of us in love with ""Pern""",Typical of the Pern books. Very good and just enough different to make reading it exciting. I would love to know how these books lay in a timeline. Does anybody know of a timeline of the series?
5,Book Review,I liked this book about Pern. I liked this book very much. Enjoy Science Fiction. Especially books about dragons. I have so far read all of the books about the Dragon Riders of Pern.
4,"Good selection, Great art.","This book is an anthology of Pern stories. Pern is an easy alternate universe to write in. I have been lured into trying my hand. After reading several of the he ""Perndragon"" books, There was this blue dragon buzzing around in my head; and trying to flame out of my ears. I had to move him into my hard drive. His story keeps growing in there.The book's art is phenomenal for today's world. The picture of the dragon chick pulling his wings out of the shell is precious.Tom Kidd sure knows how to pull on your ""Parent"" genes. If that little dragon chose you, you would sure feed it!There are several other sketches of both people and dragons included, all good, and rendered so they look like charcoal sketches."
4,Feels like you're reading a black & white movie from 1950 !!,"All of Hammond Innes' books have the same wonderful ""Feels like you're reading a black & white movie from 1950"" experience. Typically, its man at his best against nature and a harsh environment with a clock ticking against him on every page. Honestly if you're looking for some deeply stirring literature, go elsewhere, but if you're looking for some thoroughly enjoyable reading, look no further."
5,Eye-opening,"This is a wonderful asset for any teacher, school, or educational leader. The authors write in a way that is easy-to-read and captures the interest of the reader. Thought-provoking, eye-opening, and motivational are just a few adjectives that can be used to describe this book. When finished reading the book, you WILL be motivated and inspired about teaching...if not, you need to go into another profession."
2,Wasn't the Inspirational Book I was Hoping For,"I read the author's book, What Great Teachers Do Differently, years ago and found myself both motivated and inspired. I picked this one up hoping for the same. I expected a book that would renew my passion for teaching. This book did not deliver.There were a lot of great ideas about making your classroom more inviting. As an extension, there were also great ideas about how to make a presentation space more inspiring. There was no other useful advice or inspiration.The author writes in the same positive tone as in his other books, but the book did not live up to its title."
1,Hardly a Heater...,"I bought one of these at the recommendation of one of Holmes' customer service reps. Boy was she wrong! This has a large surface area, yet the only part that heats up is the very top, a very inefficient design! At its hottest setting, and on ""high"", a warm wave of air drifts upward out the top, doing very little to heat the room, or even me, standing two feet in front of it!I used to use their parabolic, radiant heaters, which at only 1100 watts put out more heat than any of their other 1500 watt models. However, for some mind-boggling, unknown reason, they discontinued making those. So, I would strongly recommend no one waste their money on this model, it's awful......"
1,I do not recommend this product!,I own two of these heaters and I am getting ready to discard them. They over heat to the point where the plugs have burnt and are melting. The electric sockets are showing signs of burning and melting as well. I have contacted the Holmes Products company and expressed my experience with this product.
1,Holmes Heater,"VERY VERY Dissapointing! Rubbing 2 sticks together would make u warmer than this heater. It takes about 20 mins to warm to full capacity. The vent at the sides does not let any heat out, as the picture/model suggests. The only part of the heater that gets hot is the top vent....and its ""warm"" to the touch (no hot like it should be). A heater with a fan mechanism would probably be better!"
2,Not so good,"This book is in need of some negative reviews. I mean come on all 5 star reviews except one honest one? When the used copies are driven to to one penny, that's a good indication that maybe the book isn't as great as the reviews seem to show. Fortunately, I got this for a buck at the used book store. This book was so obviously written by 2 women for women. There's some pretty puritanical viewpoints here too. Like no sex for 3 to 6 months in a relationship. I didn't think the book was so good. Surprising with a testimonial from Caroline Myss. But maybe it's only because she's praised in the book by the authors. I would recommend Conscious Dating instead."
3,Not That Good,"I bought these based on the reviews on Amazon. I have to admit to being a bit disappointed. While these earphones are fairly good (better that most stock earbuds) they did not match what people have been saying about them. I found the mid and upper ranges to a bit cold and flat. They were clear, but lacked some dynamics. The bass is almost non-existent. I thought that from these reviews that I'd be wowed. I wasn't.Don't believe everything you read, try them first. These earbuds are okay, but not of the quality I was hoping for."
3,Sounds Awful,I personally think that these headphones do not sound that great. The bass is truly lacking and the highs are not very clear either. I bought these headphones because of their previously 5 star review but I stand firm in giving it a three. Don't buy it to try it out. You'll regret it.
3,Don't Fit,"I should know better than to buy things like this online without having physically tried them. I've only had them a few minutes and I can tell right away I won't use them. The sound quality is really good although I wasn't all that impressed by the bass as some were. I get better bass from my crappy iPhone earbuds. If I'm not mistaken, these have been advertised as sporty? Hah! They fall off my head if I yawn. They are way way way too loose and I've always thought I had a fairly big head. They would last about 2 1/2 steps jogging. I will say they look cool, that coming from an old fart like me even :). I'll either pass them on to someone who might find them more appealing as far as fit, or I might just return them if I can. Next time, I hope I remember to not buy things like this online. Sorry Skullcandy. No hard feelings."
5,teens love them,"My teens love them...great sound, love the fact that the earpieces rotate (?). I have not used them myself; just reporting that they think they are great!"
4,"The Battery for The XPV plane, poor marketing, but good product","After an initial recall of 250000 of the black battery pack units for fire/melting, they re-released the grey and white versions of this unit, and I must say, I can't be dissapointed. fits right in, clicks in place, charges in 45 minutes like it claims, then flies for about 10-12 minutes in the XPV. Not bad. The caviat, sold separately at 30 dollars, which was what I paid for the XPV itself. Dumb marketing that likely killed this line of toys prior to it's discovery that it actually is fun and worked.JAKKS PACIFIC FYI: If you want to require something to use in a toy, sell it with it, you can move more units!!!!. It's like selling a car without an engine. Learn by watching SONY and APPLE, bad marketing kills good ideas (the BETA and MAC). Being to tight on pattents and thinking of money kills business."
2,A low point in an excellent series,"I was badly disppointed by this CD, especially after hearing some other works in this series. The Mendelssohn is especially disappointing - such a moving work spoiled by a dead performance. I'd recommend Milstein/VPO/Abbado instead."
1,isaac stern's playing sounds like a screech owl,"scratch -- scratch -- scratch -- screeeeeeech! if that is the kind of violin tone you love, buy this cd, you'll love it!"
5,Yeshiva student's guide to success,"Actually the author wrote the book in Hebrew and the transliteration is exactly like amazon.com has it. But the English adaptation of his name is ""Yoel Schwartz"" (which is how it's spelled in the [translated] book). Also, the Hebrew version was titled ""The ben Torah and the yeshiva"" (in Hebrew, of course).With the technicalities put aside, let's get to the heart of the matter.It starts off with a general introduction to the importance of Torah study and the value of the yeshiva. In part two, it talks about relationships between students and between the teacher & the student. In part three, it discusses what ""hasmadah"" is and touches upon mussar (ethical) study among other things. In the next part, it goes into the yeshiva student's role in society. The book closes with general information for the yeshiva student, like choosing & leaving a yeshiva.The author received approbations from Rabbi S. Z. Auerbach and the senior rabbi of the Mir Yeshiva in Jerusalem."
2,Passing It On : The Inheritance and Use of Summer Houses,"Although interesting, the book does not contain much practical information. It appears to be a college term paper that the author went on to publish. I do wish there were more usable ideas and realistic suggestions."
3,How to study foreign languages,"I too think that there should be some sort of description to read before deciding on a product such as a book. Can't imajine how they are expected to sell it without one. So I copied a description from the ""Dymocks Bookstore"" website:""A practical reference for university and senior secondary school students. Theories are explained in straightforward language, including factors that affect the learning of languages, such as motivation, memory and a range of strategies initiated by students themselves. Examples are taken from the beginners to advanced levels, including print and other media, individual and class study. Students report their use of computers and how they have approached the learning of culture. A final chapter has advice on taking examinations"".The above mentioned website is charging AU$39.99, so the price here is not bad.Rating of only three due to lack of information provided.Hope this is helpful."
5,A Great Book,"Have you ever wondered why God just didn't destroy Lucifer, thus preventing him from causing chaos and havoc in this world? Why did God permit him to live and why does He continue to permit him to live? The first chapter of this book explains the reason why. This book makes the Old Testament of the Bible come alive and goes right along with the Bible. I especially enjoyed readiing about Joseph. If you want to enrich your knowledge of the stories of the Old Testament, this is a good book to read."
5,Wonderful!,"I've read the two previous books in the Theodora series and was eagerly anticipating the release of the third. Theodora's Baby was everything I was hoping for and more. Kevin, Theodora's family, and the people from St. Norberts were all back and as quirky as ever. I was also pleasantly surprised to see how much Theodora had grown; I'd always enjoyed reading her funny journal entries, but was glad to see that in this book she seemed to be maturing somewhat, both spiritually and personally. A fantastic book that I would recommend to anyone."
3,The Fool's Run - Sandford,"Apparently, The Fool's Run is the first of the LuEllen-Kidd novels. Thankfully, I read The Empress File first, as it is a far better book. Had I read The Fool's Run first, I'm afraid I would have been left with a poor impression of the characters, especially LuEllen who was an interesting, exciting character in The Empress File but was merely a cocaine-snorting burglar in this installment. In addition, The Empress File characterized LuEllen and Kidd as essentially moral in what they did. Sure, they were criminals but they were doing what they did for the right reasons. In The Fool's Run, that's not so clear and causes them to be somewhat less redeemable.All-in-all, this might be the least engaging Sandford novel I've read thus far. It is, however, entertaining enough to keep the pages turning."
3,The Fool's Run,"The book arrived in a timely manner but I was disappointed to find the book had been stamped all over the inside front cover and on the outside pages of the book. When I ordered the book it said it was in ""excellent condition"". I wanted the book to complete the series in my personal library and was unhappy with the appearance of the book."
3,the fools run,"i haven' t finished book yet it is the typical non prey books sanford novel,his prey series is the very best."
2,Mediocre Sandford,"This story's main problem is that it is significantly outdated IT wise which detracts from the thrust of the whole thing. Whilst it is an easy 'plane' read and has some of Mr. Sandford's trademark elements, in the end, it is not a satisfying experience as old hat technology merely underpins a flimsy story which suffers from both predictability, and at some points, extreme stetches of incredulity!Stick with the Prey Series which are in a different league from this unremarable rendition of a very old theme saddled with even older IT elements."
4,The Fool's Run,"This one is a little slow to get started, but picks up considerably after introductions are over. Well written, great dialogue, but weaker than most Sandford books."
2,Sandford surprisingly disappoints!,"I don't know if I could have been more surprised. I have literally loved almost every John Sandford novel I have ever read. I was really looking forward to this first chapter in the Kidd saga. What I got however, seemed like it was written by a completely different author. Maybe it can be chalked up to it being an early novel of his or the ""cutting edge"" technology of the time is so outdated now, I don't know. The Prey series has always impressed me but this might put me off the rest of the Kidd series. The characters were so hodge podged and lame. It was weird compared to Lucas Davenport, Virgil Flowers, etc. If you want good Sandford you might want to skip this and look for the Prey novels."
5,I love Kidd,"I'm a huge fan of John Sanford, and have read all the Prey's, but I like the Kidd books better. It isn't many authors who can have a hacker and athief as a protagonist and another as the leading female character. John Sanford is one of a kind.John Foxjohnwww.johnfoxjohnhome.com"
3,NOT AS GOOD AS PREY!!!!,"Some of this book was great, some was bad, bad, in my openion. The bad to me was the great detail Sandford went into to describe what was happening to the computors and how that would screw things up. It was way over my head, I skipped several pages just because I did not understand what was going on. If you do read The Fool' Run and The Empress File, read The Fool's Run first. I did not because it says on the back of The Fool's Run, and I quote, "" Kidd and LuEllen return in Fool's Run. They do not return it is the first book. Part of the action is very fast moving. I liked the suspense of breaking into the houses and the handleing of the so called mob men. I enjoyed The Empress File better but neither one is as good as the Prey series. Read those if you want a good mystery. Read this one if you want to be reminded of the old ""Mission Impossible"" show on TV."
3,Kidd Begins,This appears to be the first of the Kidd books. It's ok but the story lines improve as the series progresses.
3,Dated but still good,"This is one of Sanford's earlier efforts and even if there were no references to using the internet and computers twenty plus years ago, you would be able to tell he had not developed his style to the point it is at today. It was an okay read from one of my favorite authors."
5,Solidly built,"There are many imitators out there, but you can see and feel the difference in quality with this product. Also you could easily switch the direction of the support legs to go the other behind it if that suited your situation."
3,Generally Worthwhile Stuff,"70's female numbers done by 90's female artists. There's the story, and it works out about how you'd expect. Several of the numbers are killer - Eve's Plum doing ""If I Can't Have You"", Ebony Vibe Everlasting's gospelesque take on ""We Are Family"" - while others simply don't rate - Pet's ""Have You Never Been Mellow"". The disk seems to lose its drive about halfway through (I don't know how bad the 70's were, female-wise, but did they need TWO Roberta Flack numbers?). Probably worth the reduced price, whatever your political affillation."
2,Could go either way ...,"Of the many tracks on this CD, there are only 3 good covers. However, they are really good covers, so if you have the space to store this CD you might want to get it. ""If I Can't Have You"" and ""Dreams"" are really well done, and ""More More More"" is a fun interpretation. There are millions of ""Dancing Barefoot"" covers in the world and they are all much better than the Johnette Napolitano version here. ""Cherry Bomb"" is a great song, but this version doesn't make much diversion from the original. Everything else is forgettable."
5,Great Deal and Durable,"So far this things held up nicely. I haven't thoroughly been tested yet, but Keeper has a great reputation."
4,Functions Exactly as described,"I don't know what else there is to say, but it works. The dial is easy to read and it appears to be accurate. Would definitely recommend to a friend especially for the price."
2,Not a Thriller,"I agree with those reviewers that believe that this is not Agathat's best work, far from it. Her foray is mystery and this books attempts to be a thriller, which doesn't work at all. I cannot say that the writing is bad but this entire book is just not interesting. Her other books that have to do with world organizations are much better although also couldn't be compared to her regular setting of a family murder. So much of the plot just doesn't make sense and apart from the three main characters everyone else remain hazy, which is never the case in any of her other books. I have the entire collection and must say that this is her most unsuccessful literary attempt."
2,A sad performance by a master,"I am a big fan of Christie in general, but this is one of her later novels that falls into the ""nothing is the same since The War"" category. If you have read a number of her books, you can definitely see a tendency for her post-war novels to have these themes: the Kids Have All Become Violent, No One is Who They Say They Are, and Civilization is Just Going To Hell Generally. This novel is one of the latest and worst examples of this post-war group. A barely believable spy story is interwoven with endless chapters of men in a room discussing the direness of the situation. Christie wrote some stellar novels, even some that changed mystery literature forever, but stay away from this one, it's pretty worthless."
1,Among the worst Agatha Christie's I've ever read,"What made the experience of reading this book even worse was the fact that I just read Christie's So Many Steps to Death which was also an extraordinarily unlikely spy thriller. Even more troubling was the almost identical plot twist involving the ""Youth Movement"" and most eggresious was that Christie plagarized herself by, in both books, use the same antecdote of someone going to hear Hitler speak and being caught up in the frenzy of the moment and afterward not being able to recall a specific thing Hitler had said.Pass on this one."
1,would give it 0 if i could,"This book doesn't even deserve to have agatha christie's name on the cover. It's by far the most dissapointing book A.C. has ever written. I finished the book, an yet I can't find the mistery in it, it's so ovbious from the start, that reading the first 30 pages and the last 10, you're not missing anything and you're not waisting your time reading it.I'm very dissapointed by it and I wouldn't recommend this one to anybody. Truly Agatha Christie's WORST."
3,Not Christie's best but has interesting bits in it.,"I have to be in a particular mood to read ""Passenger to Frankfurt,"" because it is, as Agatha plainly says in her introduction, ""An Extravaganza."" You'll get to experience a little of a German airport; a lot of an ancient German ""schloss;"" a lovely German forest; Wagnerian music; several interesting characters & several grotesque ones; and a little about how the British Secret service works. It is not a parlor mystery like most of hers; it's more like an adventure. But one thing you should know: If you want a really good analysis of Hitler & the Nazis, you will get one here. Agatha was a chemist's dispenser in both World Wars & she knew."
3,Not Colonel Mustard did it in the library with a candlestick,This books seem to be failed James Bond type spy mystery with neonazis.Even the romance is bollixed between the two central upper class English types.The young Siegfried is a Wagnerian operatic leitmotif that forms a centralplot element. Even the secret weapon is nothing deadly...She seems to have completely misunderstood the youth movements of the 1960's.
4,Good stuff,"I really liked this story and the plot was exceptional. The only thing that upset me was the sort of muddled ending. It felt rushed and hurried. She should have left the mystery open with no conclusion. That might have worked better. It was nice to see Mr Robinson again and his trail of money theories. If you don't expect the usual murder mystery, jump into this on different terms and enjoy the excellent narrative style and as usual, the more than fascinating characters. That grotesque Charlotte woman was a real kick in the pants"
5,A wonderful video,"Our Daughter just loves this video, particularly the ""growing"" track; which she constantly wants to watch. A real hit with an 18 month - 2 year old!"
2,Not Nearly As Good As Baby Songs,"My now 2 1/2 year old son has loved his Baby Songs video since his first birthday. I recently bought More Baby Songs and was very disappointed. The first two songs are cute ""Walking"" and ""The Hammer Song"". Next came the high chair song which shows a chimp in a high chair flinging food all over the kitchen. Not exactly something I want to encourage in a young child with little impulse control and an ornery streak a mile long. The ""Crazy Monster"" song and ""Watch a Wicthie Whiz"" were actually a little frightening to my son. The last two songs ""Wild and Wooly"" and ""Family Harmony"" were too backwoods, hick for me. They were intended to be, but it's a little much. Stick with the original for fun songs with cute themes."
3,Scary songs...,"I love baby song original, and 'more baby songs' is still more of the good stuff. What let's it down for me is the 'monster' and 'Witch' songs. I don't like the scary songs for little children. Keep the good, bin the bad."
2,"Nice try, but flaws hold this back from greatness","The size and metal body were too cool to ignore. I got a killer deal since this was on clearance, but a week later, it went back to the store.Why? Because I get horrible, random white spots appearing in photos. There was no rhyme or reason for them, though I think they were caused by reflections.I also had many problems with auto focus and constantly had to adjust the scene mode and flash to get a decent picture. Sometimes pictures would look great and other times they would be blurry, as if the camera couldn't figure out what to focus on.The LCD also fails to ""gain up"" in low light, making it difficult to frame shots in less than adequate lighting.On the plus side, the size and speed are fantastic. I would recommend looking at the newer T50 and T100 models, as Sony has addressed these issues. The CyberShot DSC-N2 is also a terrific alternative."
4,Another Great Compact Sony Camera!,Beautiful design for it's time. I must say the build quality of Sony products as of late has not been on par with older models. Step up your game Sony!!!
3,I wouldn't recommend it.,"I've owned this camera for about three years. I am always pleased with how fast it takes the pictures in the daytime without flash, and how well. But at night, as other people have complained, I have experienced white spots, but only on a few. Other than that what I really hate about the flash is that it takes SO LONG to actually take the picture!!! If you are taking a picture at night of something going by you, by the time you press the flash and it takes 5 seconds to actually take the picture, the object is gone and you missed the shot. I HATE that about this camera. The size and design are cool because it fits in your pocket, but that's not a reason to buy it. Pick a different camera."
3,"Small form factor, stylish, but pic quality is lacking, imo","I bought this camera for a recent trip because I wanted something that would be easy to carry along. While I was very pleased with the form factor and performance of the camera, I don't think it takes great pics.I took about 250 pics with this camera on my vacation in all types of settings and lighting. I would say that only the outdoor portraits and landscape pics were decent. Even those are not as clear as I would like. In dark lighting, or in any shot with bright lights, the pics have lots of artifacts and are very blurry.At any rate. If you're looking for a convenient camera and pic quality is not your top criteria, this is a good camera. However, Idon't think I'll be hanging onto mine."
2,The only one problem in my vacations,I bought this camera to my trip in Europe and only 5 days after my departure from home the camera broke. The LCD display becames dark. Other important thing for new customer of this camera is the white spots in the picture when you use the flash at night. I don't recommend this camera to anybody.
4,Good compact but a little slow,"I own a cybershot 4.0 and had been waiting to purchase a smaller, more compact Sony camera, but wanted it to be approx. twice the resolution, so decided to buy the DSCT-10, in hopes it would be smaller camera, with bigger screen and faster at getting those quick pics, as many of the newer cameras are now. Well, 2 out of 3 ain't bad. The resolution in prints is excellent, the screen is large and quite nice and with the shake resistant circuitry I don't miss the viewfinder, as I thought I might. The smaller size with built in lense cover/on-off slider switch is nice, and this camera does shoot a little quicker than my 4.0, but not as quick as the larger Cybershots and cameras from other makers. Having said that, I am still happy with purchase."
5,amazing! Definitely a must watch,"Simply put, Giant Robo is the embodiment of all things i love about anime! It has the most amazing story lines, breath taking battles, and characters that you feel compassion toward. i must admit that at first, i was discouraged from watching this show based on it's animation style. But looking back now, i realize that i was fool!Giant Robo is one of the most exiting, and flawless anime i have ever seen. You cannot call yourself a fan of anime unless you have watched this show!"
4,Scribbled over publisher's name,"The book itself is an important addition to the occult shelf and lore. But I do have a complaint: They are really nice looking hard covers and spine is skillfully pasted over a paperback, so far OK, because the price is very accesible and these works are otherwise hard to find. My problem is that they have several several unsightly ballpoint ink undecipherable scribbles over the original publisher names. This very noticeably diminishes the quality of the product, it looks very sloppy and is offensive to the buyer who rightfully expects and paid for a new book, which this is not because of the scribble disaster. Please, get a self-adhesive stamp that you can paste over the original publisher's name, or even more decently use a ""re-issued on (date) by..."" rubber stamp under the original publisher, this would be to your credit in respecting the book and the reader by avoiding the current mess that appears in the front pages.O. Benedict"
3,Disappointed Shopper,"The photo shows the lamp with autumn colors, but the predominate color of the leaded glass shade is green."
4,Lucky we like it because we got no response to return it!,"My girlfriend and I have been sleeping on this mattress for about a year or so and it is a million times better on my back than my old bed, however it is not as good as the Temperpedic one I tried in the store. We couldn't sleep at all on this thing for the first couple nights and I tried to return it, but the owner of Dynasty didn't reply to my emails. Fortunately we got used to it and sleep very well now. I would still rather have a slightly softer bed, but this is a great value for the money. Fortunately this shops from Amazon now so returning it shouldn't be such an issue, but then again, what kind of return box are they going to send? Someone let me know if/when they do. I am sincerely curious."
5,New Bed,Very good bed. I never want to get out of it in the morning. Have had great nights of sleep ever since we got it.The only downside was that the bed smelled of chemicals for about a week after we got it. But now its fine.
2,Unhappy,We received our Cal King mattress. It had a large ridge down the middle. It felt like it had been used before. There were definate valleys where you would sleep that were very soft and the ridge was very firm like the mattress is supposed to be. The very first night my husband said he felt like he was rolling down hill. We actually could see that the sides both sloped down.I haven't yet contacted the company as their return policy says that we would have to pay the shipping which would be huge. And there is no way we could compress it enough to return so we feel stuck.
4,wonderful bed with great pricing,"i bought this mattress about a week ago, and was arrived yesterday. i was so suprise how good the mattress is, it has a nice firmness and so comfortable-( as good as a high-end name branded mattress)- but there is one small problem- the chemical odor. i have been aired it out for almost two days and the smell still lingering. i hoped it will goes away soon. i can't wait to sleep on it. If anyone out there could give an advices about eliminating the chemical odor, i would be so appriciated !!!!!!..overall i would give this mattress 4 stars and pricing 5 stars."
4,Great introduction to the Crusades,"The perfect book for anyone looking for an introduction to the Crusades. Bradford deftly walks us through the entire history of Crusading in this highly readable volume. Although this book is 35-years-old and does not have the benefit of much of the new research done on the Crusades over the last couple of decades, it is very accurate as an overview. Bradford does an a especially fine job fleshing out the personalities and motivations of the Crusaders. Most refreshingly, Bradford avoids taking sides or judging history as so many so-called historians do today. For anyone not looking to get into the heavier (but excellent) histories by Jonathan Riley-Smith and Thomas Madden, this book is an excellent choice."
3,Holly & The Italians - 'Right To Be Italian' (Wounded Bird Records),"Originally released in 1981, now here's a new wave band that I BARELY remember. Nothing real outstanding, but so-so 'girl power' music, if you'd care to call it that. Not even SURE if I'd consider this to be new wave or not. Several tracks that I thought were okay are ""Rock Against Romance"", ""Just Young"", the ballad ""Just For Tonight"" and ""Poster Boy"". Line-up: Holly Beth Vincent - synthesizer, guitar & vocals, Bobby Collins - guitar, John Gatchell - trumpet and Kevin Wilkinson - drums. Might appeal to some fans out there of the Waitresses, Tourists, Scandal and possibly Lene Lovich."
3,"Great story, TERRIBLE ending","All the other reviews pretty much hit on the theme of this book, but I felt I had to point out the ending, which is probably one of the most cop-out and contradictory endings I've ever seen in a book. The feelings Lui has when she discovers what happened to Ama are described in detail, and then within the space of maybe 2 pages, she has totally changed her mind and the book just ends abruptly. The rest of the book was fascinating and maturely written, the ending seems like it was written in five minutes by a angsty and confused teenage girl, which I guess it was, but a MAJOR disappointment when compared with the rest of the book."
3,"Not for everyone but a fast, quick read","Hitomi Kanehara's, ""Snakes and Earrings,"" for most people will either be a 'hated it' or 'loved it!' experience.If raw, explicit sexuality in your leisure reading doesn't make you uncomfortable then this may book may be worth your while - especially when considering that it shouldn't take more than 1 hour for the average reader to finish. Just keep in mind that at times the imagery and description conjured can be shockingly racy.Also, much has been made of the fact that Ms. Kanehara won the Akutagawa Prize (Japan's top literary award) at the ripe age of 20 for this slender work, so some of you may be curious about this work based on that merit alone. For this reason alone I would recommend giving this work a try as long as you don't find the subject matter too objectionable."
5,"Amazing, simply amazing!","The book starts out with the main character, Lui, wanting to get a split tounge. Written from her point-of-view, she goes on to talk about her relationship with her boyfriend Ama, and a tatoo artist named Shiba, and the facination she has with split tounges and tatoos. As the story goes on she becomes more and more depressed with her life and the point of it all. Since she is the one telling the story you can really feel what she is feeling, and it's facinating to see the emotional places she takes you.Throughout the book she continues to put larger studs in her tounge as to prepare it to be split. This ends up being a sort of reference to where she's at physically, emotionally, and spiritually. I won't ruin the ending but I guarentee it will be a suprise and that you will read it more that once.Truly an amazing book, I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for something a bit different, and something that will remain with you after finishing it."
2,for long bus drive...,"I've read this book in the bus on my way back home from summer holiday.I must say I'm not very impressed. I was quite surprised with all recommendations and comments on the book's cover.It was OK read for this long bus ride but nothing more than that. I couldn't identify myself with anything and anyone in the book. it was horribly unconvincing, sometimes even ridiculous."
2,Surprisingly hyped,This book is mostly hype. The writing is not that great. Japan must be really dying out if the country of some of the world's great literary giants can award such a prize for such weak work. However the book has erotic energy and is fresh in that way. If you are a serious reader skip this book.
4,A good C.D,"I found this C.D at a local bookstore. I heard ""Last Letter Home"" on the Radio, off of ""Daisy."" I got ""happy nowhere"" first though, not knowing what to expect. I have to admit now, Peter Stuart is an amazing songwriter for the time. He has a distinctive voice too that says--""..I feel really good about these songs..."" ""Haywire"", ""Would you be Willing"" and ""The Prince's Favorite Son"" are very good. Dog's Eye View is one of my favorite bands to hear now!! I recommend this album to anyone who appreciates well-written songs...."
2,"Well, It's Nice He Was Able To Record An Album, But...","This is mostly a laid back acoustic sounding album.The most articulate lyrics are in the mellowest songs. The most enjoyable songs are the one's that rock, like ""Everything Falls Apart,"" and ""What I Know Now.""I know people like this, but I can't get into it, and I do like music that is similar to this. There is just something that doesn't grab me, as this kind of music does when others explore similar musical territory.It might be the suitable soundtrack for some's next morning after."
1,The worst ever book on programming,"I'd like to say you could do worse than to buy this book . . . the truth is it'd be hard to find one worse than this self tutorial travesty. In truth no book would be a better way to learn C than having this one. Mr. Corriveau has numerous programming language errors within the first 80 pages that make it impossible to run most (if not all) of his 'samples' as they are. His lecture note style organization would be difficult to follow even if the book had had a proof reading before it was released to publications. His near 800 page book is 900 lbs worth of frustration. It took an experienced C programmer to clean-up and rewrite Mr. Corriveau's sloppily written 'sample code'. In his book he states that C programming isn't for everyone . . . well certainly not the way he approaches teaching it. To sum up, it'd be challenging to find a book equally poorly written let alone one even worse."
2,Day Bed Frame,I ordered this day bed for my daughter and although it is a beautiful frame it did not come with the spring attachment to hold the mattress. I wish that had been mentioned in the ad because that just added on another unanticipated expense.
1,Damaged product,All I can say is that I got ripped off with this order. The product did not arrive in time because the first time it was shipped it got damaged in route and the second replacement came in a box that was patched up and taped all over and product was damaged. Seller did not respond. I was completely ignored by seller.This makes me think twice to order things like this through amazon again.
1,Poorly packaged and not of good quality,"The taped together pieces of a box to form the package gives you an idea of what you will find inside. It was missing some small pieces which luckily are used for ""looks"" only. The knobs do look like they do in the picture but the little cup pieces under the knobs are warped and don't look right. As everyone else has stated...and I will state...it DOES NOT come with daybed link spring frame. You need this piece to even use the bed at all. This should be stated clearly."
3,Unsatisfactory in advertisement,"I am so angry about the purchase of this Day Bed.It doesn't state ""no link spring"" . For the amount of money I felt I was getting a good deal til it arrived without spring. Contacted the store who told me it is on page that advertises it. Low & behold that part isn't stated til after the dimensions & product reviews, which at the time I wasn't interested in. I believe that kind of very important information should be stated just below the picture of the product. I now have to figure out where to buy such a thing at another cost to me. This to me turned out to be an expensive purchase and a lesson to question all products being bought. I think Amazon needs to look into the advertising taking place on their site."
4,MiniDisc / MegaCool,"This was my first MiniDisc player/recorder and I still use it for dubbing CDs and MP3s. It's small size is great for when I'm travelling around town on the bus or making a long winded trip via air. You can track your tunes out just like with an AudioCD, putting about 20 tracks on one disc. The lower compression recordings don't sound great, but it's better than sitting on that bus listening to some freak yelling obscenities. Most recently, I upgraded to an iPod and just drag and drop one months worth of songs onto my 10gb unit, but I prefer taking the MiniDisc on longer trips---it's durable and expendable."
3,Excellent product if you are okay with low volume.,"I bought this product about 6 months ago and have tried everything I could think of to record MDs so I could listen to them at a fairly high volume. I was hoping I could get the same volume that I got from my Sony Discman. Instead after making MDs and listening to them at the gym, I can hear people talking around me, I can hear the gym sound system blaring over my MD player. I just could not get enough volume out of this thing to get me pumped so I gave it to my girlfriend and she loves it. I guess she doesn't need music to get going at the gym. Bottom line is, buy this mini disk player only if you want mini sound."
4,20 Years of Beautiful Music,I really am enjoying the arrangements of the old classics here. A nice CD to provide unobtrusive background music for a calming environment.
2,not good for dancing,I bought this thinking it would be a nice change for recital music....I think it would put the audience to sleep. The 2nd track would have been perfect but it adds in the stupid drums...it was trying too hard.
3,Not Entirely 101 Strings,"Basing my opinion on the LP's I have in my music library, there is not way that 101 Strings would ""jazz-up"" some of the Laps [tracks]. This Orchestra originally consisted of melodious orchestrations, similar to ""Living Strings"" ""Romantic Strings"" and even comparable to ""Mantovani"".Therefore, it is my opinion that the contents are not entirely that of the ""101 Striongs Orchestra"" as I know.H.R.Hickey"
5,"Much better than I expected, especially for the price","This is probably among the Top 5 favorite CDs at water arthritis classes, based on the comments I've received. I attribute this to both the excellent choice of songs, and 101 Strings' performance of them.Do be aware that the song times stated on the back of the CD jacket are incorrect, and some by over a minute; for most of us that makes no difference."
4,Story Description,"The story traces the lives of six high school girlfriends from 1917, told through the memories of one. It is now twenty years later, and she is a middle class Bronx housewife. One girl has become a world-famous actress; another is a frustrated concert singer who finds fulfillment in teaching music; one is a ""boyfriend stealer"" who lives to regret her actions; another marries a Russian engineer and ""finds satisfaction in being solemn about the future of the Soviet Union"" and of course there is a career woman....Several months before the book's publication, it was announced that David O. Selznick had purchased the movie rights, but despite the efforts of a number of screenwriters (among them Budd Schulberg), no movie ever reached the screen."
4,It actually contains the mess!!!,"I wish I had bought one of these years ago! It works great, seems to be of good quality materials, washes up easily, and contains all of my puppy's spills and dribbles. Nice rim really holds the water and spills. Buy the matching bowls too.... they fit over the paw prints and sort of ""lock"" into place - which keeps them in the middle of the mat. My only complaint was that the stupid sticker label was very hard to remove."
5,super helpful pet placemat,Omega Paw Pearilized Pebble Hungry Pet MatThis was perfect for keeping my messy kitty eating area clean. My cat likes to dip her paw in the water and food so she makes a mess around the bowls. The lip is perfect to keep messes confined and it is so easy to clean. Plus it looks so cute under the dishes.
5,Great mat for my messy Maine Coon cat.,"This mat is the perfect size for my cat. She is a very messy eater, but it contains 90% of her food debris. Easy to wash clean; just the right thickness to be sturdy yet flexible. I like the cute shape but really it would be great if it were just rectangular. My kitty likes to put her paws on it to eat too. It doesn't move around; very pleased with this product."
2,Water gets trapped underneath,Water easily gets trapped underneath this mat. I bought this mat because it was large enough to hold two very large feeding bowls for my German Shepherd. I couldn't find another mat that size that could contain a mess. The water trapped under the mat has caused my wood floors some damage. I am currently looking for something better.
4,Love these pet mats,"These pet mats are really nice, easy to clean and hold my greyhound's food bowl in place. The raised rim makes them great for any spills. The only reason I didn't give them a 5 star rating is I think they should come in other colors. This grey color works OK for us because it blends in OK with our flooring...but this may not be true for everyone, so that is why I give them 4 stars as some may like to choose a different color."
4,Great mat!,"A solid product. I got two of these mats. One for food and the other for the water dish. I only wish they got rid of those imprinted paw prints as it makes it a little bit awkward to place the dish , but it still does the trick."
4,Great for sloppy pets,This mat is great quality and def helps contain the mess my chihuahua and pug make around their food and water bowls. Price is lower than what you will find in stores as well.
4,Excellent Review of basic dances,This is an excellent review of basic dances if you are planning a cruise. The segments were easy to watch and understand.
3,This particular book is a Reprint - and not worth the price,"I have an original book of ""Mormon Settlement in Arizona"" which is a fabulous history book. My critical review is NOT about the history but the publisher who made this particular reprint. The pages in this book do not coincide with original books. This reprint refers to pictures or images WHICH ARE NOT IN THE BOOK. Also, the index is only an alphabatized listing of names and places BUT DO NOT HAVE PAGE NUMBERS included. What good is the index without page numbers. Where are the pictures that the book refers to? This reprint is lousy for the money and I would encourage others to double check other reprints. I should have returned mine."
1,4 inch is too big with a plastic spine.,Very poor design without thinking.One layer plastic spine was too weak to hold papersand it broke in a couple weeks.
4,Brother PT-1280 P-touch Electronic Labeling System,"The product is very good for the price. The only short-coming is that there is about 1/2"" of wasted tape each time a label is printed. The replacement tape catridges are a bit expensive though. But all in all a good purchase."
2,AC Adaptor scam,"I understand that I did not check out if this came with an AC adaptor. However, to price an adaptor [...] more than that of the product itself [...] does not seem correct. You are better off paying for a higher end model that comes with an adaptor. Atleast you get more features for your money."
1,wastes tape horribly,Terrible waste of tape. Makes tapes too long I have to cut every one with scissors. Tape is expensive. Don't buy.
2,Look Elsewhere for Personal Use Label Maker,"I must agree with the other reviews I have read. It's a great machine in that it does what it is supposed to do and is intuitive. My problems:1. Total waste of tape (which is $$$) because it prints an extra 1"" on each side of every label you print. Keep scissors nearby.2. If you clear out the text by pressing Shift + Clear, it clears all settings including the font size. It defaults to ENORMOUS SIZED FONT that I don't think I would ever use. Their smallest size is still kinda big for a file.I am simply not willing to buy the a/c adapter (sold separately). I purchased this for the office and if it were for personal use, I would return it. Because of the HUGE waste of ribbon; the limited font sizes (normal - big - enormous); and the requirement for scissors with each use I give it two stars. The Brother name is worth less now in my book."
4,Almost a super *,"I took this device out of its package and printed the label I wanted without having to read the instructions. It gets high marks for an intuitive UI, and quality. The only thing that brings this from being a 5 * product is the waste of _very_ expensive tape and the lack of an AC adapter which I knew before getting it. Two reels of tape equal the price of this machine btw."
2,Tape is costly; best off getting the PT-80,"Unless you enjoy wasting your money on the refill tape, this one is nearly the same as the PT-80, but the ""TZ"" refill tape for this 1280 is at or more than $20 per refill. The ""M"" refill tape for the 80 is about half the cost and has all the same printing features as far as I have seen (I used the 80 regularly at work and bought this 1280 for home use). Also a main reason I bought this one is that the TZ tape comes in 3/4"" and 1"" widths for more printing options; however this model does not fit the larger widths, maximum is 1/2"", so don't waste your money on this one. I got burned."
4,Brother PT1280 Electronic Labeling System Review,"It is a very good product and it is very useful. However, it wastes entirely too much tape. It is just ridiculous at the space that is left at each end of the tape. I bought this to use for so many things but then when I realized how much tape would be wasted I realized it would only be used for specific projects. Otherwise I really like it."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money!,"If I could give this labeler negative stars, I would. It is a money waster. Every time you print a label, it wastes 2 inches of label tape on either side and you have to end up cutting the excess off. The label tape is very expensive and the labeler continously wastes it! Please consider another labeler because you will hate making labels with this one!"
2,"Wasted tape, wasted money","I bought this product without first checking Amazon reviews and I regret it. If I had known that this machines was designed to waste 1-2 inches of tape each time you print a label, I would not have bought it. The real cost to the label-maker is in the cost of the tape and if you are literally wasting 1-2 inches for each use, then a roll of tape will not last very long. I called their ""customer service"" line in the hopes that I had not set the margins properly but was told that although they receive complaints EVERY day about this problem, it's not a design problem, it's my problem. Not very helpful and extremely frustrating since I asked if there was a way I could provide customer feedback for the next version of this model. I would not recommend this label-maker and I definitely would not recommend calling them for help either."
5,Fun and easy to use,"I can easily forgive this labeler for its waste of tape. (As I've never had a labeler that didn't waste tape!) The features like the borders and shadow text make this a fun product for labeling my children's belongings with a little flair. Also, my 5 year old was able to learn how to use it within minutes, it was so easy. Definitely worth the investment."
2,Inconvenient scissoring of EVERY label,I like the *idea* of this labeler. I like the querty keypad and the form factor. The labels are nice as well. But I have to use scissors to trim each label because of the ridiculous inch-long strip of blank tape on each label.To whoever said this was an easy fix using the 'chain print' function: You're wrong. I don't print several identical labels in a row. I need a label now and a label later. One at a time. If I was willing to do a bunch at once I would use my computer printer to make labels.What was Brother thinking?
2,Waste Away,"As most everyone has noted previously, this label machine does waste a LOT of tape. Oddly enough, I really do like this labeler. I like the many options it has and the regular keyboard-style layout. One reviewer (""It doesn't waste tape if you set it up correctly"" - Lynn B) noted, you can change the margins to reduce the excess tape. However that's not quite the full story. Reducing the margin only saves tape on one end (instead of 2"" of excess tape, you now end up with 1-1/8"" of excess tape). If you print multiple labels in one sitting, then the reduced margin is beneficial. If you're like me and print one label at a time - as you need it - then you still end up wasting tape. I recommend you set up for the reduced (narrow) margin, but you'll still end up cutting off an inch of tape. If it wasn't for the wasted tape issue, I'd give this machine 5 stars."
2,"PT-1280 is a cheap machine to buy, expensive to keep in labels!","Agree with ALL of the reviews about the PT-1280 wasting label ribbon. I bought this machine about 4 months ago at a Staples while I was in store to fill an immediate need. Sadly, I didn't do my normal research & check how much it was on Amazon or, more importantly, read any reviews. The cost of the machine itself is cheap, but the label ribbons are so pricey you think twice about labelling. In addition to the narrow margin & chain print functions (which you have to set EVERY time), another way I've managed to get more out of the label ribbon is by using the carriage return/ENTER key. I stack titles on top of one another to make the ribbon last longer. But again, you have to use scissors to trim the 2 separate lines in 1/2 - which defeats the purpose of having a label maker... I wouldn't buy this again ever. But since I have it I buy labels from ptouchdirect to make the best of a bad situation."
5,Luv It,"I love this little contraption. Some people have written negative comments about it, and I would like to address these issues. If Brother were to come up with a ""cutter"" that would automatically cut the label to a certain length, and center the text, it would have tripled the cost of this unit. When I bought this product, I knew that a pair of scissors might also be necessary, and that wasn't a big deal for me. Yes, the tapes are a little expensive, but the product works well, and I am happy with the results that it gave me."
3,Inconvenient,It's been well said about the wasted tape. I just have to emphasize the Inconvenience Factor of having to cut almost every label with a scissors so that it will fit on a folder. Really offsets the convenience idea of labeling easily.
2,Battery Life Poor,Like the labels but detest the waste of the expensive label tape. I have ordered an AD30 adapter as after my first set of batteries the 1280 tells me my new batteries are bad! They test fine. Did not see this problem with any other reviews.
4,good thing to have,"Had it for over a year now. Using occasionally, never changed the battery. It does leave big gaps between separate prints though, that's why I give it 4 stars. tape doesn't cost that much."
4,So glad I bought this!,"I read through all the different reviews for electronic labeling systems on Amazon before I purchased this (Martha Stewart had recommended it on her show). Got it at a fantastic price! Yes it does waste a bit of tape but I took one reviewer's suggestion of doing the CHAIN PRINT option and to try printing all my labels at once. And the tape is not expensive when purchased through Amazon. I only paid about ten bucks for mine and it's 26 feet long. I mean, really, I labeled everything in my kitchen (spices, jars, etc) and I still have LOADS of tape left! I would definitely recommend this product."
2,PT-80 wastes less tape,"If you want to waste a lot of tape, this is the labelmaker for you. Though you can shorten the margins, your settings aren't saved once you power off.The PT-80 has far smaller default margins, and virtually all the functionality of this one. It is the far better purchase."
5,brother label system,I purchased this label maker from Home Depot for more then the price that amaZon is asking. The product is really great very easy to use and comes with sufficent label cartridge. My only complaint is that there is no plug in adapter included. Like the previous reviewer said it says the product takes one but it is not included and must be purchased seperatly. For the price one pays for this item it should be included! Other than this one complaint i would recommend it highly for anyone looking for a quality labeling system.
2,TAPE WASTER - Big Time,"This labeler will waste a lot of that expensive tape. If one prints a 1"" long label, 2"" are wasted. But hey, this is the trend. They want to make the revenue on tapes, not on the printers. They learned it from HP and other printer makers."
3,Very Wasteful Machine,"The print quality and ease of use is very good. However, like others have said, it does waste a lot of very expensive tape unless you are going to go through a huge hassle with adjusting the print mode every time you print a label. I was SO SURPRISED today when I went to buy a refill of tape for this machine. Depending on where you buy it, you could spend anywhere from $15 to $20 just for one refill tape! I was prepared to pay between $3 to $6 for one- WOW! I am still in shock!"
2,Not the best model,I don't like this Brother labeler model because it doesn't save the size format from use to use. Every time I turn it on I have to start over and re-size and change fonts for my labels. Every other model I have had saved your changes from use to use. Not exactly a time saving feature.
3,Good Product,"This printer makes very nice labels. There are many different ways to print labels. (Sizes,fonts,direction etc.) My complaints are that it will take awhile to learn how to use this product. Trying to figure out size, length, width, for every different kind of application is an exercise in trial and error. Also, every time I print a label, about 1.5"" of blank label comes out first (which is a waste of label and can become pricey) and the print button is in the wrong place. When trying to cut the label, the way it is positioned, your thumb hits the print button again. I have gotten better at this, but occasionally I print an unwanted label. I would recommend this product, but make sure you buy a label cartridge at the same time. The starter cartridge does not last that long."
1,Died after a dozen uses.,"I bought one of these a couple of years ago, for sporadic use. I've used it maybe a dozen times, light use each time. Last use was probably six months ago. I took it out, changed the batteries, and discovered that it no longer powers on. I also tried using a DC power adapter with no luck."
1,"Wastes tape, bad design",Every label starts off with 1 inch of waste which has to be removed with cissors. Very frustrating. Do not buy.
5,Brother PT-1280 Labeling System,"Was bought for my daughters 3rd grade class, Great price and the Teacher loves it."
3,"Powerful, yet fake, layered, and redundant","This album's sound is pretty much a year and a half to two years old. It would of probobly been a hit in 2003. The Prom Kings are a quartet with a singer, guitarist, bassist, and skinsman. You listent to the album, and you hear 2-3 gutiars, a keyboardist, a programmer, and some strings, etc.I dont know how 3 instrumetns can pull the sound off live. It has a very Nine Inch Nails meets Seether sound, but neither of the heart either of those bands have. The bassist has some skills.The album is really well mixed and arranged, and the riffs have the moments. The weak points are the lyrics and the overall fakeness of the album. The Game appears on track 7, but even thats shallow. It doesnt seem they two artists were in the same room at the time of the record.This album is a good deal at bestbuy for 6.99; but for no more then that. If you want to pick up some good rock records this summer, check out: Life of Agony, 10 Years, Taproot, or Dark New Day."
4,Betty's always a good cook.,"I purchased this as a shower gift. I had two different brides getting, and Betty had two different but similar cookbooks. So I gave one to each of the gals. My hope is that they will be as well worn and used as the Betty Crocker Cookbook I received as a shower gift 30 plus years ago.I did like that nutritional info was given for each recipe, calories, fat grams, etc."
5,Great Bridal Shower Gift,"Perfect gift for a bridal shower or wedding! I bought several to give.I have recieved numerous thanks from the brides who have found the cookbook to be useful, especially for unexperienced cooks."
4,Great for newlyweds and older-weds!,"Gave this to our new daughter-in-law for Christmas, and she loves it. Our daughter had received this as a wedding gift 5 years ago, and recommended it as a good cookbook -- she still refers to it often. You can never go wrong with Betty Crocker cookbooks!"
5,best cookbook ever,This cookbook has absolutely EVERYTHING in it that any kitchen could need. We bought if for our daughter for Christmas and loved it so much that I ordered a copy for our kitchen. Every kitchen would benefit from a this cookbook.
3,"Good, not Great","Clint plays a cop with several short-comings, especially whores. He can't seem to get enough of them, and neither can the serial killer. If the lead of this film was an unknown actor, you probably wouldn't watch it. This film is for Clint Eastwood fans."
3,Not bad and not great,Again a character we have seen so many times it almost got to be too much. Also I find it disturbing that a man who is in charge of police operations finds it 'normal' to spend his evenings around prostitutes. I guess that might really have been the case at some point in the past for a man whose wife had left to go with someone else....
3,Unusual Eastwood,"This is a very interesting film. What makes it even more interesting is that Clint Eastwood is the star. Sure Eastwood is in familiar territory. He plays a New Orleans cop hot on the trail of a serial killer. What makes this movie special is it's particular contradictions in the character played by Eastwood. On one hand he is a good single father to his his two daughters, and on the other hand he enjoys sleeping with prostitutes. He is charming when he is around his new love interest, a played by Genevieve Bujold, but he also says sleazy things to her. Additionally Eastwood is not the tower of tough that he normally is, instead he displays real emotion. Unfortunatly the plot in this movie goes down the predictable road. However, it keeps you guessing and Eastwood is fantastic. A must see for Eastwood fans and people who like strange movies alike."
4,okay flick,"THI ITEM IS A GOOD MOVIE , BUT THERE ARE SOME MINOR FLAWS IN THE DISC , OTHER WISE I AM SATISFIED WITH THIS ITEM"
5,Tightrope,I love this movie and all of Clint Eastwoods movies. I was grown up on Clint Eastwood because he was always my dads favorite actor. I can not imagine anyone wanting to give his films less then 5 stars because he is so awsome and so are all his films. This movie is a good thiller and is action pacted. I wouldn't trade any of my Clint Eastwood movies for nothing. This movie is worth the money to buy it and of course as uaual Eastwood's acting is excellent. If you have never seen this film you are missing out on a good one.VLH
4,Action packed drama,If one wants an action packed drama they need not to look no further than tightrope. Tightrope is an action packed film that packs a punch. Clint Eastwood plays a police detective who is on the edge of a rope. While on assignment investigating these female rapes and murders his housemaid is murdered and his daughter is kidnaapped. He pulls out all the stops to get his daughter back and solve the crimes. It is one movie you don't want to miss.
4,Great Clint,Eastwood at middle age--milder that Dirty Harry. He is much more of a human being with flaws. Mild violence compared to todays features
5,Eastwood as ghost director,"Eastwood replaced Tuggle as director after, I believe, one day of torpid self-doubting direction. Tuggle maintained directorial credit, though this film is directed by Eastwood himself. And it shows."
5,Low Key but Hilarious stuff,"This is one of the greats by L&H. It's fairly low-key in comparison to a lot of their work, but it has some real sidesplitting moments as well as the gentle humor (the ""antistooges"" as I've often considered L&H) that they are renowned for. The simple tale of ""honesty being the best policy"" could have porbably been told in a short-subject format, but this feature has no wasted moments. My favorite is the scene where the wives go to the movies thinking that our heroes died in a sunken ship in Hawaii and they see L&H jovially cavorting in the streets of Chicago in a newsreel. Stan and Ollie's clowing in this scene (their wild dance with the umbrellas is worth the price of admission alone) contrasts nicely with the wifely outrage.But enough of that-see it and enjoy."
5,Magnificent!,"In the French speaking world, Garou is well known. For the English market, he is the best-kept secret. Prior to being discovered by Luc Plamondon for the role Quasimodo in ""Notre Dame de Paris"" which had made Garou an overnight sensation in France, he was happily singing in Quebec bars. In ""Seul avec vou"", Garou's interpretations of ""You can leave your hat on"" and ""R&B Medley"" alone are worth the price. Garou's rough, husky voice has incredible power and range. He is quite adaptable at singing emotional ballads such as ""Que L'amour Est Violent"", ""Je N'attendais Que Vous"", ""Demande Au Soleil"",""L'adieu""; R&B songs such as ""Unchain My Heart"", ""Georgia"" and ""Power of Love"" as well as pop tunes such as ""Gitan"", ""Seul"", ""Au Plaisir De Ton Corps"". His unique voice, charisma, naiveté and genuinely down to earth attitude combined together - must be seen to be appreciated. Live shows are simply fantastic!"
1,LIVE already ?,"GAROU, the vocalist who wants to go by on one name.Guess that GAROU (meaning WEREWOLF) views himself on the same level as MADONNA. On this CD ""GAROU"" tries too hard to impress the listener. He over sings (a la MICHAEL BOLTON) almost every note of every song sort of like a werewold whaling at the moon. Plus, it is much too early for him and his label SONY to place a LIVE RECORDING on the market when the artist has only ventured out with one studio CD of original material.If you're searching to obtain a great FRENCH POP recording, I strongly suggest anything from ""SYLVAIN COSETTE"" or ""BRUNO PELLETIER"". Bruno is a currently one of the strongest male francophone vocalist on the planet. He has a tremendous vocal range that blends right into the solid pop/rock material supplied by his label."
4,harsh light,"It is a sturdy, nice looking floor lamp. The lamp shade shape is nice too, but the shade material which is a milky color glass does not filter and distribute the light in the most ideal way. Light comes through it is a little too harsh."
1,A Terrible Vacuum!,"I purchased this vacuum over a year-and-half ago and have hated it from the start. The first problem is that it has very limited suction strength - it might pick up a penny (as others claim), but often it won't pick up a stray piece of lint (no matter how many times I try)...and it leaves so much HAIR behind that I have to follow up with an adhesive lint brush!!! (And since I have long hair, there are always stray hairs around the house, no matter what I do). Also, this vacuum has such a small cleaning path!!! And the hose detaches from the wand on a regular basis - and to top it all off, I have found using a canister vacuum to be very inconvenient. I'm now shopping for a bagged upright vaccum, hopefully with more cleaning power and a much wider cleaning path."
2,Wand Failure,"This vacuum has good cleaning power, however, the wand continually fell apart when in use. Also the swivel hose attached to the main casing popped off several times as I pulled the vacuum along. For my particular use (very low-grade carpet) the wheels were set too high. Just didn't work for me!"
1,Horrible,"I didn't have the problem with the wand, but my Telios has no power whatsoever. It's the worst vacuum cleaner I have ever owned. I will go back to Miele from now on."
2,terrible sound job,I love Deceased... let that be known. What I HATE is a terrible mixing job where the drums are barely audible. This album comes off as a mess simply because of the production values. Even King Fowley's entertaining between song rants aren't enough to save this.Don't get it even if you're a diehard
4,childhood favorite,"I still have my 40 year old copy of this wonderful book, which I have enjoyed re reading to my 3 year old. The rhymes are better than average (for this age group), and the premise, while familiar to us now as ""The little shop of Horrors"", still seems fresh when told and illustrated by HA Ray. If you like Curious George you'll love Elizabite."
2,It is a strain to look for the points,"The underlying theses of seeking to integrate the gospel message with social justice, and to see Christ in those suffering, are so important and intriguing in themselves that it is unfortunate that Kenneth Leech presents points without developing them. The entire book is rather flat and puzzling. For example, he mentions the classic Greek saints who were ""fools for Christ"", without adding the essential parts of their stories that show their holiness - one wonders if insanity guaranteed the heavenly crown in itself. As both a devout Christian and a political liberal, I had expected to be enriched by this work. That goal was not fulfilled. Trying to figure out what Leech meant was tiresome."
4,Terrific,This is just as cute as it looks and is a great way to mark your child's growth. There are slots along the side that fit a wallet sized picture so that you can see what you child looks like at each measurement. The only problem with this is that you can't have your child stand up next to it and mark how tall they are periodically since it is fabric. You are only able to put the pictures at each measurement. I guess if you are really creative you could figure out a way to sew on markings and dates/ages of your children along the side too. Overall it is a cute idea!
2,It looks cute but it does not work well,This product looks cute but it's scale is not accurate. And there is no way to write something to record kid's growth. It might be a decoration in kid's room that is why I didn't give one star.
1,doesn't last,It did seem to keep the insulin pens cooler but after just 2 months of use it would no longer activate. Do not buy this brand.
3,"Smelly, short lived, and clever",I bought this product. It didn't last very long (eventually it stopped working after a few weeks to a few months). It would get slimy and kinds smelly too. Clever idea and I would buy this type of product again if they could figure out how to make it last longer.
1,Don't waste your money,"only used it twice. the first time, it worked great. The second time, after only a few hours the insulin was hot and the pouch was leaking the gel crystals. I had to throw it away after only one good use of it, along with my insulin. I was not to hard on it, kept it safe in a bag, and cared for it as followed by directions. Now I just use an ice pack in a ""lunch bag"" with my insulin and it works fine."
1,OUT OF DATE-,"I was so happy when I ordered this book, hoping it would help me combine my two pasions, cross stitching and computers.... but dont make the same mistake as I: this book is very nicely designed and written but it is totally out of date... when talking about the internet and computers it is essential to have updated information, adn in this case, a book written motre than 5 years ago is a piece for a museum. Internet wasnt even a boom when it was written, so imagine the kind of information it might portray. I wish someohow I would have been told of this... so please take my advice and spare yourself some money"
3,Computer Helper,"Although this book is outdated for today's computers there is a lot of information about software. Many of these software titles are still available today with older and newer versions. I found the book very informative, but some of the software was too pricey. Since this book was written there has been a substantial number of new softwares that are compatible and less costly than some of the software in the book. I do not recommend it for anyone that has a PC less than seven years old. I do recommend it for those individuals that have older systems, they will find the information useful for finding software for their systems."
3,yes i can,"I found the book very long and repetitious, but did it ever open my eyes to discrimination and what a kind and nice person SD jr was."
1,Cosmi Crossword Maker/Puzzle Maker Twin Pak,"This item promised to be a puzzle maker; however, I could not create crossword puzzles from the word lists I have for my students. I am very disappointed with this product. I would not recommend it for anyone who wishes to ""make"" their own puzzles."
5,AWW Inspiring!!!!,"Captured me from the very beginning. Extremely inspiring story that can be applied to many ""life happens"" challenges. Easy to read & easy to imagine the actual situations & events. The author did an excellent job bringing the reader in. Loved how I was on the edge of my seat at one moment, then jumping up & down with excitement another minute, then laughing out loud with tears another. ""Keep on keeping on"". Great read with a great message."
4,"One of my favorite books, inspirational","Weihenmayer's recounting of his gradual loss of vision as a young man was gut wrenching, yet his learning to cope was inspiring.He somehow discovers a love for the mountains and a passion for climbing. Weihenmayer's writing is honest and refreshing. A great book to pass on as a gift to friends!"
5,Rare Air,"This enduring story captures the essence of its author's vision. I say this with all due respect, Erik Weihenmayer opens the eyes of the reader, and helps them see life through his blindness. As a teacher, it is now on my reading list for students to enjoy and hopefully allow themselves to be inspired.One thing in particular I enjoyed about this was the sense of self-depracating humor the author pokes at himself. There are laugh out loud moments and plenty of smiling as we see one great accomplishment after another as Erik treks some of the most dangerous terrain in the world. There is a true sense of courage in Erik's approach, and I thought it was interesting to see how Erik's parents dealt with his disability. This is not only a story of courage, but a story of family. No matter the reader, there is much to be learned with this young man's life story. So do yourself a favor, get this book and enjoy a mind trip, as well as a heart trip."
4,Inspirational story of courage and greatness!,"I saw Erik speak last year and received a copy of this book. It sat on my bookshelf for a long time until I had a chance to read it! I loved hearing his stories when I saw him speak, but the book goes much further and provides a treasure trove of great anecdotes of how he has refused to sit back and be led through life. Erik's tales weave a tapestry of courageous and compassionate acts that are an inspiration to anyone who's ever climbed a mountain or reached for a goal ""because it was there"". I highly recommend it!"
3,Books,"I was disappointed in this book. I love to read about Everest and those who climb it, but this book was dry and too much about the authors whole life and not much about his Everest adventure."
3,Standard halogen 500W replacement-don't pay for shipping,"Standard 500W halogen replacement-what can go wrong? The savings in this product goes away when you have to pay for shipping. Amazon is awesome and I use it all the time. However, secondary resellers always charge greedily for shipping to pad up their profits so I wouldn't recommend this inexpensive product if you have to pay for shipping. Go to Lowe's or Home Depot and buy a pack, and avoid shipping."
3,Bulbs OK but horribly overpackaged,Terribly over-packaged product. Bulbs seem OK so far and price good. Unfortunate that there is not more objection to this wasteful packaging.
5,Wonderful and Inspiring,"Dr. Greer has written a tremendous book about the signs people have received from those they loved from the Other Side. It shows you that love never dies, and that beyond this life the ones we love are keeping a sharp eye on us, and if we look closely, we can see the signs they leave for us.It's beautiful, and I hope those people who have suffered a terrible loss will read it."
4,A must read for a grieving daughter,I read his book veryshortly after the passing of my mother. I am a strong believer in the afterlife connection and this book was very supportive to me and helped me greatly in facilitating and understanding the process of recieving messages.
1,Alot of boring stories no clear answer to how to see your loved one. More bunk,"Very little about how to see your departed. You can't affirm someone is around if you see a butterfly or a rainbow Those things can be seen everyday you are fooling yourself. I was hoping that I could learn how to feel my husband in the house. Have him drop a feather or ring a chime let me know when he was near. The books title lets you believe it explains how to do this. It was a waste. Very wordy about stories of other people that are boring and unrelated to what you thought the book was about. Can someone suggest a book that will give me a step by step on how to tell my husbands in the house and how to communicate with him. minus nonsense, kind of a right to the point kind of book please help me."
3,not as expected,"teakettle is ok, but whistle is not working , the steel it was made of is very thin,the thing looks like is not going to last long, I would not buy it next time"
2,You get what you pay for,"Cheap. Looks nice, but super flimsy. Arrived very quickly and I was optimistic when I saw it. Very thin and light metal, don't expect a copper bottom or anything close. The whistle didn't work at all. The first time I used it, no sound came out. Cheap whistle/lid did not sit flush so steam just escaped silently. I will be returning for a refund. Not recommended unless you plan to buy a new one every couple of months."
5,Gift for my 99-yr old mother,"My mother's birthday is this Thursday. Just looking at the quality and size of the kettle, I love it. She will like its size. Since the teakettle has not been used yet, I cannot comment on much else."
2,"Adequate pot, but muffled whistle",My only gripe is that it didn't whistle. I gave it to a friend whe didn't care if it did.
2,Rusty!,"I got this teakettle for about 2 months. I used it almost every day. I noticed there was rust on the edges into the kettle. So sad, isn't it suppose to be stainless steel? :("
2,Wasn't what I expected,"I had high hopes for this little kettle since it had a good average rating. Unfortunately, when I took it out of the box, the pieces of metal that keep the handle in place looked bent, and because of this, the handle wouldn't sit up straight. I decided to give it a try anyway since that was just an esthetic complaint. It did it's job of boiling the water, and it whistled (loud enough for me since I usually stay in the kitchen anyway). My other complaint came as the water heated up- the handle kept falling over and resting on the side of the kettle. At one point, I had to actually hold the handle in the ""up"" position so it wouldn't fall over. When I went to pour the water, the handle (once again) bent to the side making it difficult to pour and I ended up pouring quite a bit of water on the counter. What a disappointment! At least Amazon makes returns so easy to do..."
3,Ok,"cons:1. The whistle stopped working in2 month,2. It takes over 15 minutes to boil 1/2 kettle of water (it is really a small kettle)."
2,Outdated,Only two chapters of the book are very helpful. The sections on the neighborhoods provides a good overview but overall the book is outdated and not reliable as a resource.
1,Dated and not useful,"I received this book as a gift when I was trying to figure out how (in general) to move to NYC. Don't bother buying it: a lot of the information is dated (makes sense since things change quickly), and just about all of the advice the author gives, you'd be better off finding out from the internet, or seeking out some kind of community or friend who knows about the city. I think the ""Not For Tourists"" guidebook is better and more useful, and if you want just general info about the city, I think a traditional travel guidebook would be better."
3,lasted almost 2 years,"My daughter recieved this DVD player along with the princess TV from my parents for Christmas in '03. They also purchased the Mickey TV and DVD player for my nephew. His DVD player broke after 6 months. My daughter's just quit working about 2 weeks ago. My parents purchased them at a retail store and bought the extended warranty (thank goodness!). They replaced my nephews with a new one, and I'm waiting for my daughter's replacement. I have gotten ALOT of use out of it, but I do think it should have lasted longer! I would definately recommend purchasing an extended warranty if you want to buy this DVD player!"
1,Take heart the reviews here,"I researched this product and read the reviews, but with a nice pink casing to match the princess tv, I thought, what the heck they must have fixed the problems by now and bought one for my 4 yr old daughter for Christmas. From the moment it was plugged in, the dvd player did not work. It could not read any discs and made a high scream whine all the while scratching any disc placed in it.So I returned it, luckily the second one does work. But for how long I am not sure. If you are looking for a dvd player for your child, try the dvd/vcr combo version of this.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00065H53E/sr=8-1/qid=1140028340/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-1969544-4435058?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v;=glance>DVD/VCR Combo</a>"
2,DVD Player is Junk,We are on our 2nd DVD Player within one year...the most recent just quit working last night. I cannot believe that Disney would make such poor quality. All of the reviews you are reading about this DVD player only working for a short while are TRUE. Make better use of your money on a more reputable name.
2,It Stops Working,The reviews are correct. I bought this player for my daughter's room as well. We used it a little over 1 year and it stopped reading DVDs and CDs. When you insert the disc it just spins and spins. Finally you get a question mark in the top if the sceen. This year santa will have to bring the boring old black one that is $30 at wal-mart. Save your money...The tv so far has worked great but the remote died shortly after we bought the tv.
1,DVD player stopped after 1 year,It wont read discs and wont open to get the disc out! Very cute but poor quality.
1,AWFUL DO NOT BUY!!!!,"THIS PRODUCT IS SO CUTE, AND WITH THE MATCHING TELEVISION YOU CANNOT RESIST. IT IS JUNK, IT WILL ONLY WORK FOR 3-4 MONTHS TOPS, WE ARE ON OUR 3RD ONE IN LESS THAN 1 YEAR. I HAVE TAKEN THEM BACK TO THE STORE WHERE I PURCHASED IT AND HAD THEM REPLACE IT WITH A NEW ONE EACH TIME, I REFUSE TO BE OUT THAT MUCH MONEY FOR THAT SHORT OF A TIME PERIOD, IN MY OPINION THEY CAN SEND IT BACK TO THE DISNEY COMPANY AND GET REIMBURSED FOR IT BUT I AM NOT GOING TO BE INCONVENIENCED."
1,Waste of Money!!!!,"I have to agree with all the other reviews!! We bought this about 2 years ago and have had 2 of them.. The first one stopped reading the DVDs.. I called Disney and they told me to send it back to them.. So I did on my dime and recieved a new one, at least I thought so.. It worked for about 7months and now is doing the same thing.. I love the look,but now I will have to go and buy just a plain cheap DVD player..Don't waste you time or money!!!!"
1,disney should pull these from the shelves,"Disney needs to pull these off the shelves of all stores and reimburse those of us who wasted our money on a faulty product. I bought this for my daughter in June '04 for her birthday, and as of a couple of weeks ago, it just stopped working (lasted about 4 months...just past the warranty). It just stopped playing while in the middle of a movie...sounds like the dvd isn't even spinning. I always buy extended warranties (my husband works for Best Buy), but there wasn't one offered for this dvd player. Now, I know why. Save your money, and buy a cheaper, more durable dvd player. It won't be as cute, but it'll probaly last a lot longer!"
2,Waste Of Money,"This player was just the perfect gift for our first born. Her room had everything Disney Princess including a 19"" TV and the DVD player(junk). We got so many compliments on the set but my guess is they spent more time on the appearance then the operation. Please read these reviews entirely before making a bad investment. After four months it stopped working. You can place a DVD in the player but it reads Disc Error... We can not get any movies or CD's to play. It seems as if they are programmed to malfunction after 90 days. I am now stuck with a $100 illusion of a dvd player. The Television was a great buy though."
1,Disney Princess DVD Player,BEWARE!!! I read the reviews of others and I figured those must have been a few lemons in the production and we would buy the player anyway. What a mistake! Just like the others our player stopped working 8 months after buying it. It just stops working and you have to take it apart to get your DVD out. What a shame. Our daughter loved this and we did too because it matched her TV and bedroom. Now we have boring black player but we have no doubt it will last for years!
1,Definitly JUNK,"My daughter recieved this with the TV last yr for Christmas in 2005, she used it about 3 times till the DVD player decided it wasn't going to work anymore, I contacted Disney and they just offered to fix it for a price plus shipping, I told them about all the comments on there product and they said if it was past the 90 day warranty then basically your stuck with it, I was surprised this came from Customer Service of Disney. This really is a piece of Junk and your better off with just buying a DVD player for the Tv, not this one!!!"
2,disney dvd player,I bought both the Disney Princess and the Disney Classic dvd playes and worked great for about 1 year and both give messagedisc error- unable to read disk?? they look great but would not recommend buying this product.
2,not so pleased,"it is adorable and works well for a while anyway. my 2 year old watches barbie movie dvds before nap time and like another review i read, it stopped reading the dvds (unbalanced) now i have a princess tv,clock,boombox and no dvd player. i returned it to the store, but there weren't any left for an exchange. needless to say my daughter is in a horrible mood before nap time because she cant watch her barbie movies up in her room for quiet time."
5,great dvd player,My daughter received this for Christmas 2 years ago and it works great. She has the tv to match and loves both although she is starting to outgrow princess. I was suprised at the negative review because ours has worked perfect.
1,Not so Pretty In Pink DVD Player,"DO NOT BUY THIS DVD unless you want to hear ""Daddy my DVD is broke AGAIN"". If I had a dollar for every time my daughter said that we could buy her a state of the art player in no time. The first couple of times the DVD would spin for days and not play. We had to unplug it to stop it. Lastly we put a DVD in and now we can't get it out. This product was bad buy. A very bad Buy."
1,Not a durable product... Very Disappointed!,"I purchased the TV and DVD player for my daughter in 2004 and the DVD player stopped working by 2005. I didn't take it in to have it repaired because it would cost as much just to purchase a new DVD player. However, the TV still works fine, but I don't want to go with a different DVD player because the set will be mismatched... I'm not sure what I will do. I know if I do purchase another Disney DVD player, I will definately buy it for less either used or at an outlet. I won't make the mistake of paying $100 for it again."
1,I would not recommend this product to anyone!!!!,"I bought the Princess DVD player and TV in August 2005. We had issues with it from the get go. The first issue that we noticed was occasionally the DVD tray would stick and only come out about a quarter of an inch, then you would have to grab it and pull it out. Sometimes it would not respond to the eject command. I would have to push eject several times and when the tray would jut out ever so slightly, I had to be ready to grab it. Sometimes I would have to get something thin enough to slide into the tray and pry it open. Just recently, the tray stopped coming out all together. I ended up breaking the tray trying to get a prized movie out. Now it won't close, open or read disks. It is very disappointing since the TV and DVD player go together and the design works great with my daughters room, which is limited on space. I would not recommend this product to anyone, unless they have money to throw away."
2,lasted 10 months,"This dvd player was a gift along with the pink disney tv. The set was adorable. We loved it! But, it's not built for a 3 year old and a 5 year old. We used it for only 10 months and now it is broken. I hope the tv lasts longer, and I'm disappointed in the lack of durability of the dvd player because it was a nice design idea."
4,Dragon Warrior- An RPG for all,"Dragon Warrior, the RPG from Enix, is a excellent RPG. Although the graphics may be a little disappointing, and you may get a little tired of wandering, it's still a SOLID RPG.The sound of the game is nice and simple. The graphics are fine but they show interiors on the same map as exteriors, which makes it a little confusing. The monsters look great, although they, like the music, are simple. The color scheme could be better for a Game Boy Color game.The play control is aggravating, the story gets old if you are easily bored, but if you like the genre, and you have the time to play a time-tested and great RPG, try this."
3,Not my favorite,"I read rave reviews about this game in a lot of video game magazines, and was very excited to get it, but was disappointed with the outcome. It could be because I'm not an RPG fan, but the game was slow moving and reminded me of the Pokemon games, which were much funner than this. The one thing I liked about this game were the graphics. I don't recommend this game to anyone unless you like RPG games."
2,Fun But Too Fast,"When I first got the game it was really cool because It was really Challenging, but once you get all three people (on II)it is so easy and you zip through the game. On I it's really easy the whole entire time and I beat the Game in 4 hours comparing it to Dragon Worrior It sorta sucks."
2,Young Adult Section,"This book was pretty pathetic. The writing was weak, as were the characters. It had too much angst and very little intelligence. It felt like something that I would have wrote in the eleventh grade. Yet I feel bad because I could relate to Neil in some sense, and I started Teeth really wanting to like it. But instead I was really dissapointed. I sincerely hope that Hugh Gallagher is not the future of American literature or any kind of literature for that matter."
1,Narcissism is boring,"In movies, it's always a bad sign when supporting characters spend a lot of time telling the main character what a great dancer/singer/actor he or she is. You know that the climax, when the star opens his mouth or busts a move, is going to be a disappointment, if not an outright embarrassment.Too many supporting characters in TEETH spend too much time telling the protagonist -- a thinly-veiled Hugh Gallagher, we must assume -- what a great writer/punk poet/cultural avatar he is. In fact, TEETH is riddled with lazy descriptions, trite satire, sloppy grammar, and suburban Irish-American angst that was tired twenty years ago.There is a great novel to be written about Generation Y and the collapse of the 'zine culture, but this isn't it."
3,The Episodes Are Out Of Order,"I would like to start by saying that I love this show and that I look forward to the day when I can shear it with my children. So understand that it breaks my heart when I say that I was highly disapointed with this set.Now I can understand the Set not having special features and crappy artwork on the menues and the dvd cases, but what really gets my goat (other than the pilot missing it's original opening sequence)is that the episodes are out of order!!!!!!!!Insted of collecting the episodes in the order that they were made they are in the order that the negligent programing staff at disney aired them. So it's realy hard to fallow the continuty of the show in it's current state which is verry anoying.I know this show has'nt aired in nearly a decade, but you wold assume that the marketing staff that pakaged this set could of atleast done a little reaserch. Is that to mutch to ask?"
4,"Great disc, but missing something....","...or rather, missing scenes. The ""pilot"" episode isn't the original that aired; this is the version that has been aired practically ever since, with the clipped opening chase, and a few other shorter scenes. A huge disappointment to say the least, seeing as they managed to put the uncut pilot on VHS. So though we've been told the pilot is included, it's not in its entirety.The artwork on the box and thinpaks is strange, as some of the clips are from episodes not included (disc three's inclusion of a scene from ""Brush With Oblivion"" comes to mind), and the menus are rather odd pastiche of various characters clipped from different episodes. Still, A for effort.What would be nice for the next release is the choice of the original extended Saturday morning opening or the current opening for seasons two and three. I haven't seen it since the original airing in '91, and I doubt many people even remember it. As well, let's hope they include ""Hot Spells!"""
5,Darkwing Duck,"Ever since I watched this show on the Disney afternoon, I wanted my own copy. These episodes are classic, a must have. Even after 10+ years of the show not on local networks, I easily found myself singing to the opening song as soon as it came on. I can't wait for the next volume to come!!"
4,darkwing duck vol 1,i grew up in the 90s watching darkwing duck. it was funny cartoon. i really enjoyed it. i bough darkwing duck vol 1 + 2
3,"Pretty good, but not great","I was too old for most of these Disney cartoons from the 1980s-1990s. But I have purchased several for my daughter, like Duck Tales, Tail Spins, ect, and figured this one would be more or less like the others.It is, in the general format sense. But I have not been as impressed with this series as the others. Maybe it is a generational thing, but I am just not as crazy for Darkwing Duck as the other series. My daughter seems to enjoy them just as much and I have no trouble recommending them, but as a dad who has to sit through them sometimes, I do not plan to buy any more than season 2, which I bought at the same time as season 1."
5,Great for keeping dry!,"This little jacket was great. I live in WA State, with a shih tzu. He has very pretty fluffy hair but once we go outside in the rain, it gets ratty very quickly.With this Item I just added a blue sweater (to keep his belly warm) and he was kept DRY and warm. Plus he looks cute in it!!For people complaining about it being too big, I purposely got medium for my shih tzu so I could add a sweater underneath and its PERFECT!!"
2,Not ready for wet weather after all,Dog wouldn't accept wearing it. It was a little hard to get on my schnauzer and the size wasn't as good a fit as I thought. I had measured him for it and hoped it would work. He's fussy.
1,Unusable.,"This product is unusable because it doesn't fit my dog and the ""merchant"" has made it more costly to return the item than it would be to keep it. So I am stuck with a dog raincoat that is too big for my dog. I will never purchase from this ""merchant"" again."
1,Returned It,"Purchased the jacket for my Afghan Hound. Very disappointed to see the product was made you know where. The XXL length was good but the girth was gigantic. Even with the chintzy velcro tie as tight as it could be cinched, the belt was hanging loose. I have 3 Afghans and the jacket was swimming on my chunky one. Aside from size problems, I did not feel there was much quality here for the money. Sent it back and got the usual top notch service from Amazon in the return process."
3,i have mixed feelings about this item,"i bought an XXLarge for my labmax.There is something seriously wrong about this design when it comes to proportons.i followed the scale of how wide the chest can be per size, however:- The strap around the torax is much wider than it should be.- The hoddie is very small for a big dog so it doesn`t cover the ears properly and over all it is too tight.- Also the opening around the neck is too tight for my dog`s neck- Finally, when you use the hidden elastic straps that go around each back leg to prevent the raincoat from falling to a side, you cannot use the pocket because it is already too tight and stretched on the top from the neck opening to the back legs to fit anything in there. Also, when you put these elastic straps it puts a lot of pressure on the neck opening making it really tight for the dog.Anyway, i guess i can make my dog use it when it is pouring or some other extreme case but over all i am not thrilled with this purchase."
1,Big drawback,"This coat is a nice heavy weight rain coat, but it has a terrible odor that didn't go away after 24 hrs and it stunk up my entire kitchen. My dog would not let me put it on her!! I am sending it back."
1,JUNK,"My review of this was not posted. After the receipt of this coat, we noticed an aggressively foul smell in the house. We traced it to the jacket. At the time of my last posting (3 days) hanging it outside to airout had not worked. It has now been at least a week, and things are not better. I would NEVER put this toxic junk on an animal. Caveat emptor!"
1,Stinky dog slicker,"This dog rain coat is good for the fit, however, it has a very chemical odor to it. My dog only wore it once. He even had the chemical odor on his coat after wearing it."
1,Terrible shape. Smells like kerocene of some kind of fuel. Impossible to put on my dog to wear.,I received this rain coat and I like the coat. But it smelled of kerocene or some kind of fuel that almost made me sick. It is saturated in something. I don't know if you had it setting in a location that smelled of some type of fuel or what happened to it but it smells sickening. I could not possibly put this on my dog to wear. I am disgusted that I paid for this item. It is totally unusable and not worth even shipping back. It smells so bad it needs to be thrown out. Only you know where you had this item sitting and why it smells like kerocene or whatever fuel smell is saturated on it to make it smell like this. I would never purchase anything from you again.
4,Fit my dogs well,"I ordered an X-Large for my female Belgian Shepherd (around 70 pounds) and an XX-Large for my large lab. Both fit them well, though I wish the neck holes were slightly bigger. They are thankfully not so small that they can't wear them. The hoods are also rather small, but wearable -- not sure if they will stay on while they are running around though. The length on both of them was good, as it covers their hindquarters. 4 stars for the slightly too small hoods and neck holes, and the strong synthetic smell (they are airing out right now)!"
2,Size wrong,"Need to order one size larger, but is made well, collor good, no smell from mine, just need to return for next size up."
3,runs big,"I bought a size medium for my malti-poo, the length is spot on but around is way to big, need to alter the strap. Also oddly enough it smelt like pure gas, the smell faded after 1 wash but it definitely needs another."
4,"Good, but a few bad things.","I love this rain coat. I bought it for a bishop frise. The measurements were all correct except the chest part. He is only about 18 inches and it is made for 26-30 inches. I made it work by tying it up a wierd way though. It did have the strong rubber smell to it like everyone had said. i took it off my dog and his fur smelling like it to. We left it beside the door and when we walked in the house smelled like it. I'm gonna try airing it out to see if it works. Still haven't got to use it in the rain though. Hopefully it will rain soon! Anyways, I love it!"
4,Good raincoat,"I bought this raincoat for a 100# Lab and while this fits around him just fine, I had to cut the opening for his head to fit comfortably through and the hood doesn't cover his head, that said the length is more than sufficient and it fits around him nicely. I wish they made a raincoat to adequately fit a large breed dog (with a big, blocky head!) but this one will do the job."
2,Rain coats for dogs,This coat does not fit the head of the dogs good and I was not happy because the coat it self is great quality but they just don't make the hood large enough. So the dogs heads get wet. These coats are probably good for small dogs not medium dogs like mine I even ordered a larger size. I had to ship back the size that they say would fit my dogs. Not to happy with them.
2,Too bad!,"The raincoat looks great, but it has a strong chemical smell which is sickening. I've had it hanging outside for 36 hours but the odor is still too strong for the dog and me. I may have to return it."
3,doggie raincoat,"difficult to fit and stay in place on the dog, inexpensive price and material, for what is charged a reasonble buy"
5,Excellent Dog Raincoat,This is an excellent product. It fits perfectly on my dog. I've taken my dog out when it rains heavily and he doesn't get wet; the raincoat covers the entire dog. I'm very satisfied with this product.
3,Nice but could be better,"Typically I think dressing up your dog in outfits is ridiculous. But there are a few occasions where dog clothing is useful. A raincoat will help minimize that wet dog smell which is definitely appreciated. This is a well made, high quality raincoat. Although I have two complaints. Make sure you measure your dog and you will probably need to buy a size up. I have a siberian husky who would be considered a large breed, so naturally I bought a size Large. According to the sizing of this coat he needs either an XL or an XXL. People with very large breeds are not going to be able to buy this raincoat. My second complaint is that the elastic leg straps are too small. Normally straps on a dog raincoat are adjustable, these are not. Which means they will probably be too tight and uncomfortable for your dog. Also this coat smells something awful, so beware."
1,Does not last,"I was initially more pleased than not with this raincoat. Although the hood was not very well designed (the connecting piece is not long enough for the hood to remain secure on my dog's head) he hates hoods anyway and would have shaken it off even if it did fit securely. The leg elastics were useful when they worked. They kept the coat in place in high winds.HOWEVER... My dog has worn this coat for barely two months and it is already showing signs of wear and tear. The leg elastics are completely worn. While that would be an easy fix, the wear on the vinyl is not. The vinyl is so worn in several places that the white underlay is visible. I am particularly disappointed because my dog's previous raincoat which is at least two years old is still wearable. The older coat is in much better condition than this one!"
5,Cute & a Great Deal!,"My dog looks adorable in this, and the price is right. He is a mix, only about 32 pounds, but we got large because medium was out of stock, and it fits like a dream. Very happy with purchase. Great quality, and heavy duty."
1,"Stinky, stinky, stinky","I ordered this raincoat for my Pomeranian. He's a peanut. I don't know if it fits, as the ODOR of this garment is so repulsive, that we cannot get close enough to try it on. We've hung it outside to ""air"" out. It's day three and we still can't get close enough to try it on. Anything with such a rank smell after three days would be toxic to a seven pound animal. It goes in the trash."
1,Javahn,"All that Javahn has is looks... he doesn't have much talent, all he has is those nice green eyes and his smooth talk!! it's sad that he's so much into himself and his music is nothing to be all proud of. I do not reccomend that people spend their money in this CD because you'll regret it!! Go buy your self a CD from a REAL rapper!"
4,Excellent but flawed reference,"Listing all the nominees as well as the winners in every Grammy cataegory from 1958 through 1997 makes this a valuable reference source for record and pop culture buffs. An article about the awards and nominations for each year accompanies the listings. The articles are not especially well written, containing as they do several irritating factual errors, but for the most part its the listings that are the focus of this book and they're just what they should be. Coverage of some Grammy controversies is interesting and probably could make an interesting book of their own. Recommended."
5,"""THE GRAMMYS"" Deserves an AWARD","I really enjoy Tom O'Neil's other two books, too -- ""Movie Awards"" and ""The Emmys."" I cannot recommend these books stronger to you guys. I'm addicted to them. Get all three -- you'll thank me. (...)"
2,Cheap Handle on this for certain,"I had this tea kettle less than 3 months and the handle to it breaks off; NOT a well made product to say the least. As my grandmother use to say, "" They just don't make things like they use to "". She had a tea kettle that lasted her some 20 years; and the handle to it one could not pry off with a crow bar ! A waste of my money on this product."
5,Just wonderful and uplifting!,"Gosh,what a wonderful book. Ok, I am still hormonal I guess, but I had to fight back tears when reading this.What an amazing message, what every little child needs to hear and know (including our own inner child:) )LOVED IT!"
3,"rhymes good, artwork annoying","I prefer more delicately drawn illustrations for childrens' books, so the bright sloppy pictures in this book got on my nerves. However, I did like the rhymes and the message of the book."
5,Great Music,If you haven't heard Lorraine you should do yourself a favor and have a listen. These recordings are no longer produced by Rhino and will become increasingly hard to find. I'm glad I got mine.
1,A Complete Fraud,"Has nothing legitimately to do with Sodom and Gomorrah. 95% of the video is about a submarine going to the bottom of the Dead Sea looking for remnants of the two cities. All that is found are salt foundations upon salt foundations. The reasoning why Sodom and Gomorrah are thought to be in this area by the filmmakers is that one 17th Century map states that fact. Well, that's convincing! Also, photos from outer space of the area supposedly depict an uneven terrain under the Dead Sea.I was looking for a video on S&G; for classroom purposes. This isn't it. Mike Sanders, the leader of this trek, is definitely not a reliable guide. There are more interesting takes on the Bible in the work of Monty Python."
4,10 Minute Guide to Novell GroupWise 5,"Well organized, easy to read and understand. Covers the basics in a way that most users should understand. Not too technical, and does not cover all of the advanced features, but an excellent primer to get users up and running."
3,This book is okay,"This book was my very first crochet book. Have completed a few projects from it: potholder, Christmas tree ornament and a hat. Some of the crochet instructions are not real clear. I'm not hog wild about the book or have warmed up to it even though I've had this book now for prob a couple of yrs."
5,A Pleasing Sound for anyone who appreciates Good Music,"This album is a great collection of the talents of Wynton and Ellis Marsalis. This is pure jazz to the finest level; Wynton plays the trumpet in a finesse manner while Ellis delights the ear with his piano. The music is very playful and appealing to kids, whom both muscicans probably targeted, as well as any other individual. This is the kind of smooth, light music which puts you to sleep in a matter of minutes. I recommend this title to anyone who enjoys great jazz and great music as well."
2,not 100% pure,look im an old head when it comes to patchouli this is not 100 % pure cut with something maybe some kind of baby oil still patchouli but not pure not dark brown and thick like i like my patchouli cut with something they did send me a free bar of soap though not 100% pure gave it away to patchouli beginner ordering some pure patchouli
2,Only the 1st DVD is worth watching,"Only the 1st DVD is worth watching. All 5 other ones are nothing but still pictures of dead people and same stuff shows in all of them. Quality of the videos are horrible. Looks like everything was recorded in the 70s or 80s. Very disappointed, but again if you think the $$$ is worth it for only 1 DVD go ahead."
2,Banned in America 5-DVD SET,"Pix quality is bad and this is being nice!!! Sound was ok!!! They reused some videos 2 or 3 times throughout the set and have these DUMB sceens with their uncle!!! THIS IS/WAS A CHEAP HACK AT THE REAL FACES OF DEATH which I own and give 5-STARS to (FACES OF DEATH NOT BANNED IN AMERICA)!!!!!!!!!!! If you bought it RETURN IT ASAP DON'T EVEN WHATCH IT, IT SUKSYours truly, MADDMIKE908"
4,Strong material,"If you don't have a strong stomach or even really stiff nerves don't watch this. It really doesn't get any more real than what is contained within this volume. It's pure shock value is in it's reality. Live video of suicide, car crashes, beatings, riots, and at points just the bizarre. I have watched and looked at a ton of this stuff and some of the content is bone chilling. The real negative is the terrible backing soundtrack. That alone frays the nerves in it's pure irritating form. Does add to the ceepy atmospere though. Consider just how hardcore you're willing to go."
3,NEVER NEVER NEVER,SEEEN THESE YEARS AGO . DIDNT WATCH THEM ALL. WISH I NEVER BOUGHT THEM. BUT I HAVE THEM NOW AND ILL KEEP THEM TIL SOMEONE HAPPENS ALONG WHO MIGHT WANT THEM.
2,"Nice little book, but not worth so much money","I didn't buy this book, first of all. I borrowed it from the library for my masters thesis. It's a nice little book with some good ideas and interesting case studies, but I can't imagine who would pay $180 for this book. In my opinion, it's really nothing special."
3,Spiderman Bracelet,"I tried on the bracelet and thought it was a hoot. The wristband might be too large for a small child, hopefully additional holes can be put in to fit a small wrist. There were no instructions on how to replace the battery or light so we will have to wait and see how that turns out later on."
1,Light doesn't work,"It didn't light up and there's no battery inside to replace, so its just a spiderman bracelet with no light. bummer."
1,Not even close to new/used,"The light up spiderman part was pretty good but as far as the bracelet, it was rusted and very old."
2,NOT THE ART OF!!!,"dont mistake this one for the ""ART OF"" series books as it only contains the complete script of the film atlantis. it IS not for people looking for in depth making of the film or the production related stuff though it does contain few concept art, scattered here and there."
4,Finding Atlantis...,A good book that show you all about the film!If you did like the movie you will love this opera!
2,Dull Oil Diffuser,I bought this scent because I couldn't find the Los Cabos one that I really liked.It smells more like the outside of a lime that the inside.The scent is neither very strong or particularly interesting.Would not buy this scent again and should have given it 1 star rating.
2,Disappointing in its brevity and scope.,"I expected more from Gale-Thompson publishers than I received with this on-line purchase. Perhaps they would like to consider contacting me, local to their headquarters to write the more thorough coverage a writer and political statesman as influential as Salvador de Madariaga was deserves!"
1,Very shallow,"I was looking for an in-depth analysis of Japan, but found nothing but ruminating drivel. The author regurgitates many old themes (and complaints) among foreigners living over there. I would give this book a pass."
3,"Stylish all the way, but the temperature is too low","When Abbado misfires in Mozart, it's because he mistakes reticence for refinement. That happens on this CD quite a lot, particularly in the smiling and often recorded Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola. It wasn't smart to pick the Berlin Phil's first-desk players for the solo parts. They sound impersonal, as if they are sitll section players rather than stars, and since Abbado favors brisk speeds, the solo parts lack bite and depth. Everything rushes by too fast to show any persoanlity.By contrast, the brief Sym. #23 (at 9 min. it's even littler than Sym. #25, the ""little G minor"") is perfectly judged, a fleeting delight with a breathtaking melody in the slow movement--one wishes for more, more, more. Abbado's ""Linz"" Sym. #36 needs a shot in the arm. He skates over the surface very prettily but to no great consequnce. Late Mozart deserves better than elegance and sophisticated orchestral playing, but that's all it gets here."
4,This is excellent,"Royal hunt,a very interesting band that delivers a very interesting album,it's a conceptual cd because it mantains a unified continuity between each track,musically and liricaly. the Royal Hunt keyboard player Andre Andersen is the similar to Yngwie Malmsteem on keyboards. you're going to find a powerfull cd with a lot of neo-classical influence on the music,one of the major characteristics of royal hunt is the way that the keyboards demonstrate such a high profile by the use of solos,orchestral effects,and so much more. I'm sure you'll love the keyboards,vocals and basically the whole album,it's got a great sound,it's fun to listen to,over and over and if you like elaborated music you'll surely like this."
5,Great progressive album!,"This album rocks hard! DC Cooper's vocals are right up there with James Labrie. The background vocals are great too. The choruses are very powerful and melodic. The musicianship is great, though not up to Dream Theater standards. Neverthesless, pick this one up, it is definately worth it."
2,A disappointment.,"I bought this after hearing DC cooper's contribution to the Explorer's Club disc.His voice is not as good on this, and the songs are, to my ear, repetitive and boring. Run of the mill tunes with standard metal soloing. None of the instumentalists blew me away like DT's or other prog groups'."
4,Reaaaaaly nice,"That's nice, yeap. A beautiful album, a beautiful voice and a very very nice and tight orchestration. Buy this album.By the way, track 4 (Message to God) is one of my favorite songs ever.BUY IT!PS. Should have given it 5 stars maybe.... But, hey, there are some others even better out there, right? What should I give them then?"
1,Title was not reflective of the content.,"This video is titled ""Molly's Potty Lesson"" and misleads the buyer into thinking that it might be a helpful tool in potty training.Dealing with one's shame and embarrassment is the primary focus of this video and in a 2-3 minute segment, Molly wets on the couch and feels shame while Loonette the clown assures her that accidents happen. That segment is the only ""Lesson"" provided remotely associated with potty training. While this video provides entertainment for our children, it is by no stretch of the imagination a ""Potty Lesson""Also disappointing is the repeated use of the word ""Ain't"" in one of the sing-along songs."
1,King of the Freeze Frame,"We purchased this DVD player last year from Circuit City. It freezes consistently about 10-15 times per movie on all but the newest DVD movie. Rental DVD viewing is so awful, that we can't even invite friends over to watch on our large screen tv due to the embarassment of this. We tried to return it but CC insisted on sending it out to have it repaired vs. giving our money back. The repair attempts were unsuccessful x2, with the technician finding no problems. We are now back to the drawing board and will have to purchase another player. It definitely won't be a Zenith!"
5,Best Wrestling Game Ever Go Buy It !!,"WWF No Mercy is so much fun. I love the mathes. Ladder Math, Triple Threat, Cage, Guest Referee, and Ironman are just a few. It also has tons of wrestlers. The Rock is my favorite. It has pretty much all of the wrestlers. The gameplay is awesome. You can fight in backstage arenas like the locker room and the boiler room. You can also get tons of weapons form the stands. The best thing is you can hit the ropes and keep hold of the weapon. But the best thing about No Mercy is the ladder match. You can hit your opponent with the ladder or jump off onto them. Get this game, it is the best!!"
4,Layin the Smackdown!?,"this game is pretty cool, with the ladder match and all, but it need more options. the moves are all right, and the create-a-wrestler is all right, but it needs a hell in a cell, or a match inside a cage(not climbing out of it). It is extremely frustrating when you just can't beat a guy, and he counters everything. If only we could combine wwf attitude and no mercy... it be 3:16!"
4,"Great game, wheres the talking????","What a game! EXCEPT.... the storylines they have,the only prob with those is they talk with""bubbles"" in WWF Attitude, the wrestlers talked. Why take that out???"
5,WWF No Mercy's great review,"I think that wwf no mercy is the best game ever.When I bought Perfect Dark I thought nothing would match it and I was right.Nothing matches it but WWF No Mercy is way better than Perfect Dark.You can pick from dozens of wrestlers,arenas,weapons,and other options.I am a huge WWF fan and I have all the WWF games for N64(Warzone,Attitude,WrestleMania)and No Mercy is by far the best of them all.You can even share the fun.You can play matches with you and three of your friends.This is by far the most realilistic wrestleing game ever and I reccomend anyone one reads this letter to go and buy it."
5,Buy no Mercy!,"This is ace!There is so much new stuff ya dont know where 2 start! The ladder match is the best addition of all,coz there is so many possibilities,such as leaping off it through the Annoucers table.The SmackDown!mall is good,as the shop has everthing you need to buy an make the perfect Grappler.The Ironman match is cool,as you can change the rules to make it an Ultimate Submission Match(SEEN AT BACKLASH 2001)if you wish.The special referee mode is a hoot,as you can call it right down the middle,or pick a side!The Pay-Per-View mode makes a welcome return,enabling you to make any RAW,SmackDown! or PPV u have ever seen! All the Recent arenas have been BEAUTIFULLY created,right down to the WWF written on the padded Turnbuckles! The bottom line is that it has 65+ wrestlers,excellent game modes and lastabilty.What more does a wrestling fan need?"
4,GREAT GAME,"I wouldn't get this game now due to all the new wrestlers in the WWF including the alliance of WCW and ECW. But when it first came out it was the best game out there. It is very fun to play. The only thing is it is hard to learn how to do the special moves of the wrestlers(ex.People's Elbow, Stone Cold Stunner, Sink Face, 3D, must I go on!) If you don't care about how up to date the wrestler's are and just care about the quality of fun, get it. If you do care about the up to date of the wrestlers wait for a new wrestling video game to come out."
5,Best Wrestling game on ANY system,"I've owned about every wrestling game out there and this one takes the cake. The graphics are out of this world. The game-play smooth, and the create-a wrestler, unlimited. The only drawback is that the entrances are cut off. but that doesn't take away from the game itself. On career mode, you actually run through on-going WWF storylines running from RAW, to Smackdown, to PPV's. I will never tire of the create- a-wrestler either. You could make just about anyone you like, Even yourself. There's also dozens of different matches you could have, from ladder, to Ironman, to steel cage. I would recommend this game to any fan of wrestling."
1,WWF 'I Need' Mercy,"WWF No Mercy is an insult to wrestling games, the WWF, No Mercy and October. It's total crap and Triple H's face is not a mixture between fried and scrambled eggs.If you low blow someone, you hear a cartoon-style PING! Impressive(!)Gameplay is slow and sluggish and for N64, even though it's a piece of monkey crap, it's a bad game. When you come to your senses and destroy it, it won't be a bad thing, it'll be a GOOD thing!"
1,No Mercy 64,"I do like this game but the game doesn't work. The conditions of the game, (cover) are acceptable, it's a shame this person sold a game that doesn't work."
1,you gotta be friggin' kidding me,no mercy has got to be the worst wwf game i have ever played. for one thing no mercy does not have special entrances like wrestlemania 2000 does. in no mercy the titantron does not play when you make your entrance. also in no mercy every tag team comes out seperately and you have to buy everything from the smackdown mall and where's the fun in that? also the box says up to 10 backstage areas and there are only six. in conclusion smackdown 2 is the better buy.
2,pros and cons,"Thsi is a nice game, its fun for a while, I'd give it 5 stars except for the fact that the memory is SCREWED UP. you can win a title match, but when you go back to the screen, its gone, you can create special characters and when you go to select them, they're gone, it dosen't have the in-ring celebration as WM2000, but it does have post-match celebrations."
4,Excellent,"WWF No Mercy has its share of excellent wrestlers, excellent matches, and other features. The bad part about No Mercy is that the championship mode takes too long and doesn't get you alot of money for the Smackdown! Mall. The Smackdown! Mall is another bad feature. The Godfathers Ho and the $800 Shirt are extremely hard to get and require long boring matches to get. I believe they should've made the modes like WrestleMania 2000. The only things to get in WM2K was a few hidden wrestlers and the Smoking Skull Belt. That is why i gave No Mercy a 4."
3,best wrestling game for the 64,"I like this game very much and I strongly recumend it.Its great when playing with friends and family.The reason i gave this game 3 stars.The game dosnt have that many game modes comparing to smackdown!2 know your role for the playstation console.smack down2 has a wide veriety of game modes such as hell in the cell,casket match,and TLC.but comparing the create a wrestler from no mercy to smackdown2,i have to admitt,no mercy is much better.I also compared this game to wwf attitude.Two things that attitude has that no mercy dosent.1st of all attitude has anouncers presenting the match and 2nd of all attitude has full ring enterances including the ring.another reason i gave this game 3 stars is because of championship mode.it feels its almost impossible to get another story line without having to read the same one youv done all ready.other then that the game is great and its a must own."
5,BUY THIS IF YOU LIKE WRESTLING GAMES,Flat out this is the best wrestling game right now. If you have n64 and want a wrestling game buy this. ... No Mercy is a very addicting game. It might get a little boring at times but then after a while you will want to play it all over again. This is a must have if you like wrestling games. Your guarenteed to love it!
5,This game shows NO MERCY!,This game rules all. If you are a fan of wrestling this game is for you. All the characters from The Rock to long gone Andre the Giant are on this extreme game. The ladder match is the best match I have ever played. The only thing this game needs is a HELL IN THE CELL match. But other than that I highly recomend this game.
5,Best Wrestling Game for the Nintendo 64,"This game was made by THQ, the developers of two other superb games for the N64, Wrestlemania 2k and WCW/NWO Revenge. However, this game surpasses all other wrestling games. It features many new features, such as the updated championship mode, the ladder match, and the guest referee match (featured only on the Playstation before this point).As in all licensed games, it features many of the current WWF wrestlers, all of their moves, and all of their mannerisms. The modes make for endless replayability. However, there is one con with this game. In the early versions, there was a glitch which would erase all saved data. However, as of now the glitch is being fixed and only a small amount of games have been affected.Overall, this is a must-have game for all wrestling fans and even most non-wrestling fans will enjoy it."
5,The only wrestling game you'll ever need.,"I have played every wrestling game ever for every system. The best are Backstage WCW, and WresteMania2k and from reading all of the reviews I have to say this game kicks. With over 80 superstars and new matches like Ladder, special ref, Backstage, iron man, and table and better settings like create a wrestler has been upgraded with more moves and finishers. + now there is the Smackdown Mall where you can get points to but cool things like hidden wrestlers. All i have to say is I have already ordered the game and it is going to rule all."
3,NO MERCY SHOWS NO MERCY..........(ALSO REVIEWED BY MORSALIN),THIS GAME IS VERY REALISTIC.PROS:1) THE BEST DAMN REALISTIC WRESTLING GAME EVER....2) THE CHAMPIONSHIP MODE IS AWSOME.CON1) THE GRAPHICS IS NOT THAT GOOD... (rock looks like monkey)2) THE FEETS ARE FLAT.3)IT STILL COST TOOOOO MUCH....4) THE WRESTLERS HAVE TOOOOOOOO MUCH MUSCLE.I CANT THINK OF ANY MORE BUT U SHOULD CHECK OUT SMACKDOWN 2. AND LOOK FOR ME ONYX C. :-)
5,No Mercy is DA BOMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this game without a doubt is the best wrestling game for the N64. I love the ladder matches and to create a wrestler.(...) if you like wrestling,or even fightin games BUY THIS GAME!(...)"
1,Angry about postage,The hepa filter only cost $19.95 and the cost of postage was almost $25. I don't know if or when I'll ever order from amazon again. This is outrageous and a total rip-off.
2,Is it really Eureka?,"What is pictured for the product is a Eureka (Made with Arm & Hammer Baking Soda) HF-2 Vacuum Filter. I received a vacuum filter that does fit my Eureka Boss Smart Vac, HOWEVER, has NO identifiable packaging that states it is a Eureka product. The filter does not have the baking soda packet attached to it nor does it have the yellow rim (it's black) that I have purchased from Eureka in the past. While I know products can change slightly from year to year, I feel it's a little fishy to receive a product from a seller that has nothing on it that states it is a Eureka brand product."
4,Just What You'd Find In-Store,"I have started the habit of checking Amazon.com for pricing products that I would normally purchase in-store. This was one of my ""checks"", and the price at Amazon was just about half of what it was at the retail store where I normally would buy this item. It is what I use in the vacuum, so, to get the free delivery I ordered three -- (for me about a two-year supply), and was delighted with the money that I saved. If this is what you are looking for I would recommend this product for quality, and price!"
4,MUCH better price via Amazon than retail,"I can't find these filters for less than $20 at any store so the $11.50 price through Amazon was great. I can tell the filters do what they are supposed to do because they go from being very very white to very very black by the end of six months. And no, I don't smoke - I'm amazed at how dirty they get. City air I guess."
1,Not what they say it is,"The website pictures Eureka brand 61111 HF2 Hepa filter w/ Arm & Hammer, but that's not what I received. Instead I was sent 2 VacFX brand filters. The price is probably right for the off brand, but I want to be sure that I buy ""true"" hepa filters as I have allergies. I have no idea if these filters are as good as the brand name. This ad was definitely false advertising."
1,NOT OEM!,"This is NOT OEM. I just replaced my OEM Arm & Hammer Hepa filter with this one. My OEM filter has a pad on the back of it that has the Arm & Hammer baking soda in it. This one does not have the pad. Additionally, the image displayed and the description *imply* that this is OEM though the description does not SAY so. I ordered two of these filters and they did not come in packaging; they were just enclosed in the shipping envelope. If you have allergies, do NOT waste your money on this. I'm going back to my previous seller next time."
4,Seller is honest and customer friendly,"I ordered the HF-2 filter with Arm and Hammer inside. But I got the ones without Arm and Hammer inside. I contacted the seller, they recognized the mistake and refunded me the whole amount without asking me to return the wrong products. The seller is honest and customer friendly."
3,Not bad,"The book came in pretty good shape along with fast shipping. The book itself, though, has some weird smell to it that I can't seems to get rid of. Anyway, the price probably explains the quality of the book."
1,How to be obnoxious without really trying,"I could not stand these people! They were so self-centered and obnoxious. I don't know if it was the author's style of writing but this book seemed more about the family's dysfunctional way of interacting with each other and some employees. But actually I think they really are that way. Skip this one and buy Carol Drinkwater's ""The Olive Farm"" or Susan Loomis's books instead."
5,The Three Dollar Mule,"My 20 yr old read this book years ago and loved it as much asmy 7 yr old liked it today! This is exciting enough to keep a newreader interested with funny incidents and some exciting happenings. It is very difficult to find something for this stage of reader who is ready for something a lot more stimulating than rhyming picture books. This is particularly true for young boys who would rather be outside playing than reading. Bulla's story has a difficult mule named Sinbad, a 12-yr old boy with a broken leg, a thoroughbred horse,and some cows and chickens thrown in for lots of interest!... The book could be read to a pre-reader, it could be read together (by switching off) with an early reader, or enjoyed by anyone up to the age of 12 when they can read alone. Approved by a homeschooling mom!"
2,Inconvenient Size,"These exact same wicker baskets (of the same size) are advertised as being for organizing your changing table shelves on the Babies 'R Us website. However, they are far too small to efficiently use the space under the changing tables. I'm thinking of getting a wall mount shelf to put these on instead, because I'm unwilling to waste so much space under the changing table. The gingham colored bows are a nice little feature; they actually include pink, blue, green and white bows with every basket so you can match to the nursery. I would've liked purple or lavender, actually, but I guess you can't have everything. Construction is just as you might expect for a wicker basket, not unusually cheap or anything like that. I gave it 2 stars only because of the inconvenient size. Guess I should have measured first."
4,too small.,Too expensive for this little small soap probably would n't buy again. did not smell much like grapefruit either so
4,Not as interesting as the original but I still liked it.,"I watched the original and could'nt get enough. Found this that restarted the series, was not as good as the original."
3,A Weak Attempt to revive the Original Series,"Upstairs, Downstairs: The Complete Series - 40th Anniversary CollectionThe new and very limited series (if you can call three episodes as series) is so underdeveloped you barely get to know them. It is well done as far as acting and sets but leaves fans of the original series wondering who they are and what are they doing with the Bellamy home. I did not understand why they would make only 3 programs. It certainly left me wanting much more time to develop the characters. If you have not seen the original series you will wonder what all the fuss was about."
2,Bad Production,"Hi I had great hopes for this production after watching the beautiful production of Downton Abbey on PBS earlier this seson, and watching again and remembering the first great Upstairs Downstairs. Iwas intrigued to see if this production could measure up to the other productionWhat a dissapiointment It was awful !!! Even the great Jan Marsh couldn't save this turkey It stinks The best charaters were the Halham's Mom and her distinguished Indian secetary, the cook, and the maid IvyThe plot was terrible The bit with Agnes's younger sister Persie's involvment with the chauffer and the Politiccal Cause was a blatent rip-off of a similiar story-line in Downton AbbyThe characters of Agnes Persie Hallam ,the Butler and eve Jean Marshe's Rose were weak I would save mu money and go to your local library and rent the video Rose"
1,Not worthy of the title,It is to bad they cannot leave a great thing alone. The story line is weak and the charters are flat. Rose still being a maid at +75 is a sad case. BBC should be ashamed. The 1970's Upstairs Downstairs is great TV buy the DVD and let it rest in peace.
1,Don't bother,"Muddled plot, and a waste of some fine acting talent. Those who remember the original series will certainly be disappointed."
4,"Yes, they've done it!","The Beeb have remade a great old favourite and pulled off the job with class.The acting, production, and style are all top no.I still catch the old upstairs downstairs on ITV3, and I was worried that the BBC might rush out a cheap imitation, but boy was I wrong!Make sure you catch this gem of a show, it really does live up to the hype."
3,A good time pass for Downton Abbey fans,This series is not as well acted as Downton Abbey but I still enjoyed it as a good time pass.
1,ghastly,"Only worth watching if there isn't any thing on TV. Its best actors are the butler, the cook, Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins. One can hardly tell the difference between the characters. No blonds, redheads, and all with very similar hairdos and faces. A waste of time and money."
4,right up my alley,"Since I am such a fan of British television, this program was a delight to me. It is well acted and seems to be factual about historical events."
4,Great Brit Sitcom,"My wife has been getting into the British soaps and has been enjoying them, another favorite of hers is Dowtan Abbey!"
1,Very dry,If you are looking for a Downton Abbey fix... this isn't it. It's choppy and doesn't flow organically. Watch only if you have absolutely nothing else to view.
2,not as expected,"fairly poor interpretation of the libreto, disappointing decor,seen much better british series , i will not recommend this production to anybody"
5,Fascinating!,"I watched this series non-stop and just loved it. I was fascinated by everything about this series. It has been well cast and written. I enjoyed it so much that I ordered the second series, and I enjoyed it every bit as much as the first series. I recommend you buy both series. You won't regret it!"
2,You can't go home to Eaton Place again!,"Anyone who hasn't seen the original isn't qualified to comment except, perhaps, as a mini-series. Nor is anyone who hasn't seen the sequel but only anticipating the quality of the original.""There are things you just can't do in life. You can't beat the phone company, you can't make a waiter see you until he's ready to see you, and you can't go home again."" Bill Bryson quotes (American Writer, b.1946)Until you've ""lived"" with the Bellamys and their staff for many seasons, you will have no idea."
4,A new vision of UD,"I cannot wait for the new Upstairs Downstairs to be released, in particular to enjoy Eileen Atkins performance. The run time, however, on this DVD needs to be updated as this series ran for at least 3 episodes of an hour each making the current run time of 60 minutes an impossibility.ETA - Run time has been updated to 182 minutes, which matches the run time on the UK DVD"
1,disappointment!!!,"After hearing my coworkers rave about this show, and knowing how much I love BBC stuff I blindly bought this, even without reading one review. Lesson learned! 25 bucks for 3 episodes, really?I'm so irritated I spent the money on this crap. If the show would have been good, I might have been able to let this go, but the show sucks. Maybe I have to high of expectations after Downton Abbey, I don't know, but this is a huge disappointment."
3,z,I was disappointed in this new version of Upstairs Downstairs.I loved the old one. It was good to see Jean Marsh again but the story line is not nearly as good.
4,Excellent,Fabulous mini-series! Great acting and an enjoyable plot. Definitely recommend for fans of bbc movies. Keeley Hawes is beautiful and does an excellent job. I loved the development of the characters and how the staff grew to be more like a family.
5,Can't Wait for Season 2,Really a nice follow-up to the original series. Picks up in the 1930's leading up to WWII. Looking forward to season 2 and more.
5,Loved it,"I love this era and the aristocrats, fun to imagine what it was like. Gives you a glimpse into their past."
3,Upstairs Downstars the 2011 remake,"Excellently done, but not enough of it. If you watched the original 'Upstairs, Downstairs' you'll enjoy this shorter version, but you'll find yourself hoping to see Mr Hudson, or Mrs. Bridges! Yet this version does pay homiage to them in clever little ways. If you enjoyed the original series, you'll enjoy this one too."
2,Very Disappointing! Sequel!!,"The original Upstairs Downstairs was filled with characters you could care about, and it had all kinds of true-to-life stories that involved the characters. The character development and acting was superb.However, the new version is a huge disappointment. The characters are shallow and don't make me care about them at all. Even Rose, the excellent parlor-maid in the original series, is a disappointment. Her acting is stiff and her character is just plain uninteresting. The same with the other actors..stiff and boring.After the second episode, I have no desire to see the rest!"
3,Get the history right.,"I must take issue with the Amazon description of one character's dalliance with Oswald Mosley and his fascist New Party as ""right wing activities"". Oswald Mosley was a member of the Labour Party and was an avowed 'Lefty' and member of the Socialist Fabian Society. The conflict between fascists and communists in pre-WWII England was really a squabble among the various factions of the British LEFT wing. Try to remember that fascism during Hitler's rise was essentially 'bossy socialism' with all the assorted accoutrements of history's other left wing totalitarian movements like controlled economies and autocratic rule.The constant re-writing of history in the media is disturbing and guarantees we will repeat the same mistakes."
3,Decent show but needs a bit more storyline,This show was trying to be like Downton Abbey but in a newer timeline. It had some good things like the characters were fair but the storyline was definately missing something to keep you watching. Just needs a few more tweeks and maybe this could be a good one.
1,If You Loved The Original - Don't Bother With This One!,"Right after I spent most of a week watching all the DVD's of the original ""Upstairs Downstairs"" I proceeded to watch this new (continuing?) version. I'm very happy that I had the chance to immediately compare the two.I'm sorry I spent the money and wasted my time on this set. The original Up/Down was terrific. This one is a DUD. The characters aren't well developed nor are they nearly as endearing as the original cast. The Downstairs servants (with the exception of Rose) for the most part are immoral and vulgar and very easy to dislike (exception are Rachel and the man from India).My recommendation is not to purchase this one."
4,Great Performance,"If you like Great Performances from PBS, then you'll enjoy Upstairs Downstairs. This series is an enchanting look at the British elite lifestyle in the 40's. Enjoy!"
4,redone version of original series.....,"sometimes, it's better NOT to try and ""improve"" or ""re-create"" what is classic. It was good...but couldn't help but compare it to the original. However, diction in this one was easier on the ears..."
5,More BBC At Its Best,This continuation of the series from years ago is splendid and tops the original I believe. If you like Downton Abbey then this new series is for you.
2,Does not work 100% with a IPod Touch,"Some sites advertise that this product will work with an IPod Touch. It will if you ONLY want to charge it or listen to your loaded music. You can not play video/movies or view pictures on your TV with it(it does not recognize that you even have any pictures or video on your Touch) Also, you might as well turn off the thumbnails for your albums. They are greatly distorted. The sound quality is okay but I had to turn both the Video Dock's and my stero's volume up much higher than if I played a CD alone."
2,If you are looking for good sound....,look elsewhere. Sound coming out was not nearly as good as that on my Onkyo DS-A2
4,Handy Gadget for the iPod Classic,"This is a good idea (especially when one refuses to pay a cable company over $90.00/month for Network TV) and despite the poor remote performance, I love having the things. Yes - I have two.I'm not a techie, so I was pleased to discover the station easy to install and the interface between TV and iPod pretty slick. The remotes are a pain - particularly at any great distance - they just aren't very responsive.I like being able to shuffle through pictures and display them on the big screen, and even with my lack of technical finesse I found it simple to use and enjoy. I'd recommend this to anyone who doesn't get frustrated with the occasional lack of remote control."
3,"poor remote response, perhaps it'd work better w/ a learning remote","i mean, the thing works, my brother (whom it was a gift for) loves it, however he's no tech geek like me.i wouldn't use this myself without trying another remotethe darn thing just stinks.... no matter how well you aim it.other than that, your stuff is on screen and you can select it with the remote, which is cooland for the price i paid, no complaints thereremote just stinks is all"
5,Great Annual from the Master's Golf tournament.,Great book published each year about the golf tournament. I love that it walks you through the event day by day and tells your what the press was publishing each day.
2,Too Drab for Poetry. Unimaginative Prose.,"I expected to find some wisdom presented in a poetic way, but the poems were drab and sounded like prose. There is nothing new here and the poet seems uninspired and provencial. I was looking for good Italian American poetry, but this isn't it. I've read DiPrima, Barolini's book, Gioseffi, Stefanile, Ciardi and From the Margin, Writings by Italian Americans from Purdue U. Press and enjoyed them better for their craft and imagination. There are many good Italian American poets who reach more out of themselves into the world. Gillan's not dreadful, just not very original as these other Italian American writers. Perhaps, she should stick to editing. I recommend the other authors named above as more fully realized poets and they are all available at Amazon.com, too."
4,shadow rider,"was pleased, just as the description and picture showed, but the metal used should be thicker, its a little on the thin side, but works, very comfortable"
4,Lowe's best film performance...,"Saw this movie when it was originally released- shortly after the sex tape weirdness of the '88 Democratic convention; it was serenely ironic that at the precipice of career suicide by Lowe, he would in this film provide his best performance. Although recent work in West Wing & Brothers & Sisters has helped him reclaim a bit of appreciation, this character still resonates as a well-played, against type evildoer. A tight script, another high quality performance by Spader and an ecellent soundtrack all add to the guilty pleasure."
4,A very dark and dangerous Rob Lowe!,"Easily Rob Lowe's best on-screen performance as the expert con-man who keeps a veneer of civility over an extremely sadistic and violent nature.And the always intriguing James Spader, who gives a sublime performance as the unsuspecting victim to Lowe's sociopathic character, that is well worth the watch. Also an appearance by a young Marcia Cross who plays the sheltered and wealthy daddy's girl and is Spader's fiance...at least until Lowe comes onto the scene. This movie moves at a fast paced rhythm, and I higly suggest giving it a try."
3,Chaos,"...almost got lost in the review. Rob Lowe is young, cunning.James Spader, youthful and with generosity-but naiive!!!Spader's ""stumbling block"" becomes his tumbling ""block"" as Rob Lowe lets loose with his own brand of mischief, style and demeanor. This is the devil at ease. The duo take the lost way to hell. Watch who ya meet...I guess you never know."
4,A forgotten cult movie !,"Since the Faustian roots have had some most significant relevance than this one , nevertheless this film gets what it proposes . The translation of paradigms leads to this modern evil messenger - Rob Lowe - in a very credible role , to claim his part of the agreement gentlemen signed with a yuppie James Spader .The brutal sequences and the demoniac revenge is not for squeamish sensibilities . This film plays hard and you know the plot . We are not in a happy land .Notable performances for the entire cast . Curtis Hanson announced the world his unstoppable raising and promising career to most ambitious projects ."
3,Bad ending,"I found BAD INFLUENCE worthwhile for the performances of James Spader and Rob Lowe, despite the film's hokey ending. Too bad it concludes with a thud, as the two actors complement each other well in what starts out as a pretty good How-do-I-get-rid-of-this-guy thriller. See BAD INFLUENCE. Maybe its conclusion won't disappoint you as much."
1,By Michael Boll,"Well my name IS michael boll, and I have never seen this movie, but Rob Lowe is cool, and if I ever make a movie about my life, it will star Rob Lowe."
4,Great letter activities!,"I was given this book, by the author, when I was still in high school. I hung on to it knowing that I would go on and become a teacher. Four years ago I pulled it out when I began teaching kindergarten. I use these puppets paired with ""No More Letter of the Week"" and the kids love doing the art projects! The puppets do require some teacher guidance to put them together but, the kids are good about watching and quickly learn that the ""tabs"" go in certain spots. I highly recommend this book to a parent/caregiver/teacher who is looking for alphabet related activities."
2,This lamp is not working with my PC,I am very disappointed that this lamp only works with the Mac OS and that it does not work with my Windows XP machine. Why this lamp has a standard OLD SCHOOL 120v plug-in and not a USB cord is beyond me...
1,Used It To Light My Fireplace,"Yuck! Garbage. What is it with these Wiccan wannabe authors like this guy? For years they put out Wicca themed texts - Wicca with a twist on a theme and when Goths become big business, this guy ""konstantinos"" crawls out of the woodwork to be the 'dark genius and occult expert'? His Summoning Spirits is a far cry better (not much) but even there he ripped off Don Kraig's Modern Magick blatantly and never apologized for it.The top reviewer giving this book such high ratings cannot be a real practitioner because he'd want to go throw this book at the author if he was real. I don't enjoy trashing someone's work but Kon, you've put out your best thus far. I see nothing new in this that you didn't have in any of your previous three books. Give it a break, will ya?If you want real hard core, dark and twisted Magic, go give Tarostar a try. He's not too scared to publish cursing rites."
5,JUST BEAUTIFUL,"WHAT A GREAT BOOK.FOR A PERSON WHO DWELL IN THESE MYSTERIES,KONSTATINOS PUT ALL THE ANGLES INTO THE DARK SCIENCES.IF U A BEGINNING MAGI, THIS IS A MUST HAVE TO OPEN THE GATEWAY(ANUBIS) TO THE UNDERWORLD.TO ALL WHO IS BASHING THE BOOK EITHER U HAVE NO UNDERSTANDING OR YOU JUST PLAIN SCARED. REMEMBER LIGHT COMES FROM DARKNESS. CHAOS!!!!!!"
1,Very Bad,"Strange, scary, and not musical at all. The images are scary - grandmas flying through the air - baby cribs under water surrounded by giant fish looking like they'll eat the babies. Music/songs are completely un-tuneful and instantly forgetful. Images have little if anything to do with the songs. I want my money back on this one."
4,Young viewers will like this as a second dose of BabySongs.,"When she first viewed this video it wasn't an instant hit with my granddaughter. The songs are slower and quieter than she was used to on other Baby Songs videos. Now that she looks for more variety in her viewing and sits still a bit longer, this has become as big a hit as the others in Hap Palmer's series. As always, there are no objectionable visuals or lyrics."
1,Most disappointing of all Hap Palmer's videos,"My 20-month old loves ""Baby Songs,"" ""More Baby Songs,"" ""Silly Songs"" and ""Animal Songs."" So, it was such a letdown that this video did not measure up. The slow pace of the songs and lack of variety in each (overly long) vignette just did not keep his attention. Also, I could have done without the PC unitarian/universalist religious theme in ""Spinning on the Same Ball."""
3,Religious Nature,"I highly support Hap Palmer's videos as entertaining and extremely well produced, however I did not like the Good Night video due to the religious nature of several of the songs. Parents with strong beliefs in higher beings may not find this video as problematic as we did."
2,"NOT A ""GOOD NIGHT"" VIDEO","Overall this is a good to very good video, but it misses as a ""good night"" show. Most of it is far too bright, fast, loud, and lively to promote sleep; in fact, it seems to give our twins a ""second wind."" Just not right for bed time. . . ."
3,Eh...,This DVD did not keep my two yr. old daughters attention like the other sing-a-longs I purchased. Possibly a good DVD for a daycare at nap time?
1,Poorly designed saw,I bought this saw from a big box place recently and I hate it. This suprised me as I have other Bosch tools and love them. My problem with the tool is the depth of cut locking mechanism is plastic and a piece of junk. It has come apart twice and started to strip out the plastic locking nut. I'm taking it back and never buying anything like this again. Do not waste your money.
1,Very poorly designed saw,I purchased this saw at Lowes and it is by far the worse saw I have ever used. The base is attached to the plastic housing and any pressure on the handle will cause the base to flex causing the cut to be out of square.
1,Homeowner grade,"This saw is very poorly constructed. The parts that are critical in keeping the saws durability are all made of plastic. Bosch got it wrong with this saw, just not contractor grade. Wish I didn't buy it."
3,"This ain't ""Nevermind"" but it rocks heavy!","This isn't grunge. This isn't alt.rock. This is heavy metal acid rock noise...and I mean that as a compliment! Yep, Cobain does lend his vocals, well...err..screams to one track. But don't buy this looking for nirvana. This is free-standing, paint-peeling guitar terrorism. This makes the Dead C sound like elevator music."
1,Terrible Product and Customer Service,"Horrible experience. Bought this sheet and didn't need to use it for four months, and when I finally got to use it for first time it soaked completely through during the first rain we used it for. Contacted seller who said tough luck it's been more than 30 days since the purchase, even though I patiently explained I wasn't able to use it on my pony during the first 30 days since it was summer here and we don't use rain sheets until the fall. We weren't looking for cash back, we just wanted a sheet that was waterproof and we would be happy with an exchange for one that was. Again tough luck they said. So now I have a sheet that I paid $83 for that is useless. So I guess now I'm basically stuck with a stable sheet I have no use for! Rep I talked to was rude and snotty. Never will buy from them again!"
2,Better for a toe other than great,The size of this product is better suited for a toe other then a great toe as it binds. I would advise diabetics or anyone with circulation issues not to buy this product to use on an adult size big toe.It very may be well suited for other toes.
5,All the missing songs...,"This is a vocal selections book which contains all of the missing songs for which I've been looking. I love the music from Jekyll and Hyde's original production in London and since coming to the States, it has undergone several changes with songs being added, deleted, or changed. This one has several of the deleted songs and is a great companion to the Jekyll & Hyde vocal selections from the Broadway show."
2,Quit working after less than 20 uses,"I learned early on that this was best used for light dirt, & not to use it on caulk or grout if you want it to stay intact. So, I pulled it today after minimal usage & - nothing. Lights up, makes noise, but no steam. I've used it only as decribed in the directions, & the trouble-shooting guide tells you nothing about this particular problem. In the dumpster it goes, with my ""Bug Catcher"".Doesn't anybody make anything that works anymore?"
1,Worst star biography written in recent years,"The book is basically all the interviews I've ever read about the life of Bonnie Raitt, rolled together in one book and sold for an exorbitant amount of menoey. Bego promised new information about her life, but there was none whatseover that I could find. There are glaring typographical errors, that even the most perfunctory copy editor shounld have picked up. Furthermore, the writing style is absolutely awful. Bego thinks he's a writer, and tries to be suave but his trite commentary on Ms. Raitt's extrordinary life left me wondering why I'd even opened the book in the first place"
4,I enjoyed the book....but,"Without going into alot about this book, it was first, unauthorized so it just isn't going to have the impact as if Bonnie was sitting there by the fire on a cold night, playing some acoustic slide and starting from the beginning, but there are alot of people out their who are new to Bonnie's music and don't know much about her and it was informative without getting into a whole personal detail. I enjoyed this for what it was, some day Bonnie will sit down and tell all but until then I just get off on her music and the great human being she is. That is all you need to know, just listen to what her song say to the heart and mind."
3,Not so bad as people here think!,"Half way through reading this book I checked what amazon.com reviewers thought about it and I was very surprised with black-and-white opinions expressed here:seems that people find this book either the best biography ever written (which is not) or the worst biography ever written (which is not).I think that Mr.Bego did loving job,writting about the artist he obviously care for (no dirty sensationalism here) and if he used every available information he could (LP cover lines and so on) I understand that was the only information to be found,in his place I would probably do the same!As the book intrigued me to look for more of Bonnie Raitt's music,it did good job and even if its not the most exciting book ever written,it did provide me with some information about Bonnie which I didnt know before and it make me curious to listen ALL of her albums.Is that ""the worst biography ever written"" as the previous reviewers think?"
2,Forget this one! Read Rolling Stone instead!,"One of the most disappointing books I've ever read! There's nothing new here, no results of interviews with Bonnie or her close friends, just a rewrite of already available material. Believe it or not, entire pages were devoted to the names and styles of the songs on her albums, the musicians and producers! What a rip off!"
1,Disappointing,Being a hugh Bonnie Raitt fan one may imagine how excited I was to get this book. It actually is the liner notes from Ms Raitt's albums and various interviews she has given over the years strung together. Some of the text is taken verbatium off of liner notes.
4,Lots of Flavor,"On a gluten free diet, the selection of normal side dishes is limited to rice, potatoes or rice noodles. Overall, this spices up the rice alternative a bit. I have tried different flavors of the Lundberg Risotto, this one is the most spicy with bounds of flavor."
4,1st edition same as Her. Studies 6 and 7 combined,"I like this book as it is almost identical to the Heritage Studies 6 and World Studies 7 (2nd editions). Some of the text is almost identical. There are 32 chapters in this book, so it is designed for a chapter a week. That's pretty intense, but you get a complete world history in a year, as well as cultural history. They split it up in the 2nd editions. Although the text is 10 years old, with the Internet we can look up much more to fill in where needed. I'm working on lesson plans combined with world literature for middle school. It will be intense, but very thorough!"
5,Great bags,I love these bags!! They block the smell great. The only thing I wish is that they would sell them in a box of 50 or so to keep at the changing station. Maybe they do and I just can't find them I would snatch them up in a second if they were sold that way!!
5,Perfect for Acoustimass 6 Cubes!,"I managed to find a Bose Acoustimass 6 series III locally that included 2 of these Bose Mounts. I like them so much that I ordered 2 more from Amazon. These are the official Bose mounts. I used the 2 I bought from Amazon for the rear surrounds and now the rear sound really envelopes you. As another reviewer noted, the drill size for the included masonry mounts (which I believe can be used in drywall also) is wrong and a smaller size down works better. I bought some wall anchors at a local hardware store that are a little more substantial.These are the only mount that should be used for these speakers. Aftermarket ones are cheap and are not made for this particular setup. Do not hesitate to get these mounts."
4,Very please !!!,I order two boses spekers mount .... Its very easy to mount I highrly recommen this product to anyone that want make there bose system looking nice
2,Bose UB-20 Wall/Ceiling Bracket,Good looking and made specifically for the Bose speaker but not designed adequaterly fot wall mounting and wire feed.Bose UB-20 Wall/Ceiling Bracket (each) - WHITE
1,Item NOT received,I have tried helplessly to track this item but until this date I have not received my order.Can some one HELP????gcavaleri@sicamdev.com
5,works great!,These work just as I thought they should. They fit my Bose lifestyle 2.0 system speakers perfectly. Anyone looking for a sleek way to mount their speakers should invest in these wall brackets. You can even fish the wire through the wall so it really just looks like the speakers are coming right out of the wall.
5,Great price and works perfectly.,I almost spent a lot more for these at Best Buy or the Bose store in or local mall but I am so glad I checked Aaon first. They were Es expensive but not cheap. My new Acoustimass 10 speaker system fit perfectly and it all looks great now!
5,Best Bose bracket,I have 2 of these already and just bought another 2. This is the best bracket for the Bose satellite speakers.
4,Fits speakers as advertised.,If you desire to mount your speakers on the wall or ceiling than these brackets fit the bill. Cheaper than buying from BOSE
5,Perfect price for the product I have been researching for some time now.,Have not mounted the speakers yet but these are the perfect mounts I have been looking for and the price could not be beat.
4,just as described!,These really add a professional look to our system. My only complaint is they are not adjustable after attaching them - you have to tilt them beforehand - I do think they help the speaker sound by directing their angle. And they were cheaper here then through Bose website
2,"Be Careful, Mine Broke ! ! !","Finishing up a home theater, as I was tightening up the last screw on the white part of the mount.... IT BROKE! Did not over torque as I was using a stubby Phillips screwdriver. Wow, last screw and I get to calibrate my new surround sound, NOT. I get to wait for another mount to come in. Disappointed to say the least."
3,Bose UB-20 Speaker Mounting Brackets,These are good mounting bracket but for the price of the Bose Speakers these brackets should have been included in the box with the speakers. Typical nickel and dime add ons by Bose.
4,Bose UB-20 Brackets,"I was informed about a delay in the delivery date due to weather conditions. Other than that, product came perfect."
1,The Bose speakers did not have the right type for mini speakers,I got the bracket because it was advertised that it would fit the mini bose speakers.When the installer came in I found the screws did not fit the speakers. I had to run to home depot where they did not have the correct screw type. Then I had to go to ACE hardware where I found the right type. This cost be an hour of the installer time. I wish they could do correct advertisement
4,Great speaker accessories,"This product is great for Bose speaker systems. By mounting the speakers on a wall or from the ceiling, these placements enhance the speakers dynamic range and listening postions which makes for a true ""surround sound"" experience for movies and music."
5,Sturdy Bracket holders,Sturdy and easy to install. Fast shipping. Used custom screws for installation and lot of the standard screws and plates were unused.
3,"Good Brackets, lousy anchors and directions",Very nice brackets in that they are nice and small and not too pricey(if you avoid buying direct from Bose). The directions weren't very good and the wall anchors are total overkill if you are using them for a Lifestyle system. The anchors are 3/8 inch and you would pretty much have to take down a wall to get all four in together(in fact the anchors would overlap in the wall if you used them). I installed them with 1/8 walls anchors and had no issues with bearing the weight of the speakers.
2,Same goofy BOSE design,This is so like a BOSE design. They match the silly little tiny speakers and lack the adjustment that some installations need. So like I have always said the letters B.O.S.E. stand for Better Off Somewhere Else !!
2,Sent me to the crapper,"Even by Troma standards, this is pretty low. Not because of the filth, sex, perversion and general goofiness--I like that stuff. But the execution here is rather slipshod. Really seems like stuff that they would otherwise have thrown out, put on display to make money. At least the title is accurate. But there's too much Lloyd Kaufmann. He has a few good lines, but he's not as funny as he thinks he is. Debbie Rochon is wasted in a small but potentially funny (and completely clothed role). Julie Strain is best in pieces where she is overbearing, which is most of the time. But when she's not on screen, the movie slows to a crawl. For me, there was just too much tedium and not enough laughs."
3,'Tales' Very Troma-tic,"Maybe I am getting too old, maybe more mature, either way I didn't enjoy this movie like ""Tromeo and Juliet,"" ""Toxic Avenger Series,"" and my personal fave, ""Killer Condom."" Pretty much in the same vein as ""Terror Firmer,"" it follows 2 stories that is loaded with sickness, grossness, lesbian vampires, and cannibal hos. Also features ""Boner-Vison"" which features boobie shots galore. Too much self parody and not enough of what made Troma great. Julie Strain is well, Julie Strain. 'Nuff said there. If your looking for silliness and lesbian sex, this is for you."
2,Not Very Useful,"I am disappointed that I tried to save a few bucks by ordering this product. It works but you have to literally touch the metal with the tip. It says you should get 1.5"", you don't. I don't see an use for this item if you have to touch the metal. If you can touch it, you're there. You don't need a pinpointer for that."
4,Useful Accessory For Metal Detector! Recommended!,"The ""Pinpointer"" is a very useful hand held small metal detector used to help narrow your search after the larger metal detector has located an object. The pinpointer has a very limited range of about 1"" - 1.5"", depending on the type of metal and size of the object. This can help you find very small items and reduces the chances that your find will be damaged by your digging tools.A good accessory, recommended!"
5,"Oh, yeah !","Django Reinhardt had a first name----Legendary. Yes, while superlatives too often trip off the tongue about musician after musician after musician, Reinhardt was a true legend. Unfortunately, very few of even his most ardent fans can sing, whistle, or hum any of Django's repertoire. That's changed. Mike and Linda Ferro have crafted lyrics to Reinhardt compositions which broaden the comprehension of his music beyond instrumentalists to vocalists and a general public that aches to sing---to verbalize this wonderful sound.Mike Ferro's warm timbre caresses the lyrics. The insturmentalists backing up create variety while retaining a lush complement to the vocal presentation. It is amazing that the emergence of lyrics and contemporary musicianship have so easily melded with the music composed decades ago. The legend continues, thanks to the Ferrros."
4,Best player around for jogging....,"I've never written a review before, but I thought I could add something....1) It's not a perfect MP3 player, but hey - for running - it's light and you can customize what you are listening to unlike a radio2) I got an armband with mine. Definetly a feature to look for before you buy if you are a runner.3) Yes, the software included in the package leaves a lot to be desired. Try using the free downloadable MUSICMATCH jukebox instead. You can download a software update from the the MUSICMATCH site that allows you to transfer songs to the player.Hope this helps..."
1,No Support,"I would not buy anything from RIO again. I have owned two of their MP3 players (Rio 600 and psa[play60). Both units broke within a month of purchase. As for the psa[play60 I can not get a customer service person to return my email. I have written 3 times in a two week span with no help. On their website they list the psa[play60 as a ""legacy"" product. I think they meant ""good luck getting these products fixed"". I would recommend not buying any RIO product."
1,other option's,Check this new little mp3 player. Its called the Wakeman and its the worlds only waterproof mp3 player WWW.drivendistribution.com it holds 128 mb and has pattented water proof headset that can be heard under water as well as above and is available online @ www.drivendistribution.comBob Runman founder of Driven Distribution
4,Good player for the sports minded and inexpensive,The player was great for it's size and and quality I really like teh fact that it uses the samrt media cards which has the smallest size of all the memory card out there. The software is not very functional I don't evn use it I use the MS Media 7 player which is much betther to use. but it holds a tone of music( in WMA formatt ) and the cards makes it easy to carry a variety of music with you.
1,THis product bites the big one!!!,"So, my husband buys me this great product back at Christmas of 2001, wo we thought!!! Not only has the price gone down since then, but the player itself is worthless! I have never been able to get it to work with WINDOWS XP and now that I have upgraded my Windows Meida Plyer to the newest version of 9.1, it will no longer work on my office computer. I'm stuck with songs that I have been listening to for months now. The sound and quality of the player is good, I love the fact that it has an arm banch, but software and hardware compatability are TERRIBLE!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
2,Not recommended for runners,"I was initially very excited about this product. It is very light weight and ostensibly ideal for runners. It's meant to be used by athletes. However, it has broken 3 times now, all when running. When I run with it, either outside or on the treadmill, it gives of electrical shocks! The first time, the shock was so strong that the whole player shorted out and I had to send it back to be fixed - it wouldn't play anymore! This was just one week after I got it. The second time, just the headphones got damages, but they had to be replaced, because no sound came through them anymore. This last time, the shock was so bad that half of the internal memory was wiped out, and it no longer supports the external memory card. I would not recommend this player to someone who is looking for something durable and reliable."
4,A breeze to get started,"I'm realitively new to MP3 music, but with the software included it was very easy getting started. With in 15 - 30 mins I had music recorded on my player. A great feature of this product is that it will play WMA files also which are half the size of MP3 files which makes this player able to hold 2 hours worth of music. I am very happy with my purchase and the quality of the product."
3,There is one drawbback,"The built-in 32mb with the psa(play)60 gets you about 25 minutes worth of music(not the 60 minutes that is advertised) if you have decent quality mp3s. The sound quality is great and I have yet to hear the device skip. The only drawback is that most people do not realize that you need to download firmware from riohome.com so that you can have the choice of internal and external storage. This piece of information is not on the cd that comes with the device when you load Audio Manager. After visiting a newsgroup, I found out about the firmware and have been able to download to the 32mb MMC card I purchased for the device. I have no complaints with the sound, just with all the grief that went into getting 45 minutes worth of music."
5,One out of two.,"My opinion is that Cyrano stands alone. It is one of the best. The other, The Son of Monte Cristo, Not so much..."
4,Better than expected,"This pubic domain double feature was of surprisingly good quality. No one would mistake the picture quality for a Criterion, but it's far better than most. Most annoying is the Marengo promo at the beginning which cannot be skipped or even viewed at high speed. Want Cyrano? Or The Son of Monte Cristo? Go for it."
5,guided by voices?,Robert Pollard dreamed of this once. Buy this and your life will be fuller for it.
5,this is amazing,i have seen jets to brazil 2 times now since orange rhyming dictionary came out and they are at the top of my list of favorite bands. you can really hear touches of jawbreaker and texas is the reason mixed together. blake has one of the most amazing voices ever and the lyrics are truly touching and beautiful. anyone who was ever a jawbreaker fan should buy this album
5,Not Jawbreaker but has Jawbreaker-esque moments,I know this is not Jawbreaker but since Blake Schwarzenbach wrote the songs on this album it has Jawbreaker moments. This album has a more upbeat feel overall and is real mellow. No really rocking tunes but it has a strong solid tone through out and if you like great guitar work and great vocals this fits perfectly with you. Unlike Jawbreaker it doesn't slam you down with great hooks and fast pace. This album lulls you in quietly and really makes you think. I think in someways this was a natural progression for Blake.
5,Great Album,"For anyone who is debating on buying this album, I would reccomend it in a second.Orange Rhyming Dictionary is one of a few albums I have loved every song on. Some songs stick out like ""chinatown"" and ""king medicine,"" but every song on this album is sure to be one anyone would enjoy (who has a good taste in music)."
4,not jawbreaker but ...,if youre looking for jawbreaker this isnt it . what it is is an introspective cd that always fits your mood . jtb have become one of my favorite bands and i can put this cd away for a few months and put it on and still love it just as much .
3,Good indie rock,"This album is a good one. Their sound is fairly unique, a good, edgy mix of power pop and rock. One of the things that will instantly jump out at you is that the first four or five songs have lyrics that recall both Thomas Huxley's ""Brave New World"" and George Orwell's ""1984."" Considering the recent advances in technology and encroachment of the common person's privacy, the subjects JTB touch on are timely and pointedly scary. The subject matter mercifully changes after the first few tracks.I'll go ahead and say it, even though the rabid JTB fans will hate me for it, but these guys sound a little like Cracker, save for the Bakersfield country influence the latter band expresses. This comparison will make itself evident in ""Lemon Yellow Black"", the best song on the album (in my opinion). Just try to get this song out of your head all day. Impossible."
2,still the same but without the omph,"I don't know. I loved Jawbreaker, and Blake has really brought the same virtues over to JTB: interesting musical shifts while sticking to his pop sensibilities, great lyrics which actually seem to have improved over the Jawbreaker albums. But the album's missing something. It's missing a sparkle, that stand on your chair and sing along feeling. The music seems like it almost wants to break out, but doesn't, creating a drone, bland taste. It's like a horrible singer trying to sing a U2 song Bono style; there's something there, but there's something restricting it. And I also notice Blake's not doing any screaming like the Jawbreaker albums, so maybe he's not getting the vocal melodies like it should/could be. But hell, I also hate 24 hour Revenge Therapy (BIVOUAC's Jawbreaker's best IMO), so maybe there are some sides to Blake's music I don't understand."
2,Disappointing,"I was eager to hear this album as it came highly reccomended. I was acutely disappointed. The album is nauseatingly narcissistic It seems almost that the band was following some campish paradigm of the outcast rockstar who exploits his own troubles to get girls and money while at the same time abhorring it. The only thing that keeps it from descending into the mirky abyss of MTV rock is some eccentric melodies. The lyrics are extremely affected and surpass depressing. A rounded, intelligent voice doesnt mix well with corny references to methadone. I felt I was privy to some angst ridden, high school misanthrope's journal. The music behind the words is unremarkable. It is mundane and boring. I have never written a review. but found myself so nauseated by this wimper of an album. I felt it necessary for me to be able to achieve some sort of catharsis."
4,The Part People Misunderstand,"While everyone wannts them to be the new Jawbreaker or the new Texas Is The Reason *i'd think that be quiet nice, i loved TITR* they arent. I may be messed, but i never though Jawbreaker was any better than either of Jets's two cds. So if you want something different, which is why bands are created, to do something different then someone else, check these guys out."
2,I really wanted to like this album...but couldn't,"Unfortunately, Blake seems to have ODed on Brit pop of old Furs and Oasis. ""Orange Rhyming Dictionary"" is a very clean and well produced album, and ""Sea Anemone"" and ""Sweet Avenue"" are musical gems, but overall the Jets lack the youthful angst and energy, not to mention the raspy vocals that was Jawbreaker. And maybe that's what it's all about, maturity through music. Some people might caught Blake's new style progress and an improvement, but just the same i'd rather chill to ""24 Hour Revenge Therapy."""
5,YES!,"This is one of those albums that you purchase and then find yourself thanking yourself over and over again for owning it. Blake Schwarzenbach is a wonderful lyricist.I don't really have time to type all I want to say (Cuz I'm at work right now......) but all in all, this is an awesome album for any punk, pop-punk, rock, indie-rock, etc. fan. OR if you have any respect/knowledge of music theory, you will not be disappointed."
5,Jetbreaker,"Blake Schwarzenbach was basically the sole creative force behind both Jawbreaker and JTB, so the comparisons are basically ""early"" Blake vs. ""later"" Blake. He has produced great-sounding records with both bands. The more I listen to this guy, the higher he moves up in my personal ranking of the all-time great artists. His songs come in many different forms, his lyrics range from abstract to so simple that they're almost corny, but totally sincere. I can't get it out of my car's six CD changer after over a year. Buy it."
3,"Different, but a bit vapid.","There is some interesting music on this CD. I might license some of it for a movie, but this really isn't the type of music you would listen to by itself. It's just too simplistic. In fact, it almost sounds like an hour of someone playing around on an expensive synthesizer. However, it did catch my attention. So, give it a listen. Please note, this is not the ""new"" flamenco music that Ottmar Liebert is better known for."
4,Great Fragrance,"This is my favorite perfume. The bottle presented in the picture was not the bottle I received, so if you're looking for the pretty O Oui bottle, you may not get what you are expecting. Same perfume, uglier bottle."
2,Non-standard cars,"Life-Like Products probably does make the best HO racing cars and track. However, be aware that this particular set does not use their standard cars. These cars are about twice the size of the standard HO cars and run on a different type of track.Most if not all of Life-Like's racing car product line is HO and incompatible with this set."
2,Not well constructed,This race set is a nightmare. The tracks do not stay together at all. Hard to race when the track keeps coming apart!
4,A jewel of a book,"This book was pretty good and it was interesting to read it. There was some really exiting parts and some really boring parts, but overall it was a good book."
3,"Excellent book, but the Kindle version needs proof reading","This is a classic mystery from early Nancy Drew, a fun story that plays with early Cold War mythologies surrounding the rumored survivors of the Russian Revolution, a few of whom turn out to be hiding in River Heights! It's fun to read it again after all these years.What's less fun, however, is the slipshod editing job that the Kindle edition has been given. Ridiculously obvious and frankly stupid typographic errors abound -- the kinds of errors that any copy editor with half a brain would catch if the publishers bothered to employ one -- and the layout is atrocious with huge quantities of unnecessary white space between each paragraph and a pagination system that forcibly separates the illustrations from their captions. Whoever rushed this thing onto the e-shelves should be ashamed.The verdict: it's an excellent book and well worth reading, but DON'T buy the eBook version! Buy a print edition and enjoy it the way it's meant to be read."
3,Torn Dust Cover,"The book is excellent. The illustrations are excellent. The dust cover was torn, making it less appealing as a gift."
4,Great Book,"My 8-year old daughter just read the Wind in the Willows. She thought it ""was interesting but some chapters were dull."" ""The story is like a series of short stories, but they don't make much sense if you read them in the wrong order. A Great Book for ages 8 and up.""Isabella Kendrick, age 8."
2,"I don't think Grease was involved, but Greece may have been","Ok, let's make this short. Someone was trying to tell too much story in too short a time allotment. Or....did they put in too much unnecessary junk where there should have been story?The lovemaking, no, make that just sex, was.....odd.....too much head thrashing. Wonder if she got so dizzy that she couldn't really enjoy it?However, Jeff Fahey does pop up out of bed with nothing on, but does it with such ballet finesse that you never see a thing. Nuts.Could have been more Indiana Jones-ish if someone had known what they were doing. Who's responsible for this? Director? Writer? Producer? Actor?Sorry, Jeff."
5,Fantastic book about FOCUSING our positive energies,"Burson's new book is a fast and inspirational read that calls us to focus our energy, power, and conscious intent on the positive world we wish to see for both our personal and global selves. Energy follows thought --- our words and intentions have real effects on this physical world. FOCUS is a clarion call to revitalize the higher spiritual nature inherent in all of us."
5,Crash course on the crash,"Film debunks the myth that regular folks cannot understand what is going on with our economy. It's a crash course on what has happened...and what WE, the people can do about it. As sobering as it can be to learn these things, the more we know, the less we have to live in fear....and the more empowered we become."
3,My take,"A friend recommended it to me because I am very interested in the spirituality of money/wealth. I found it to be a well-done, professional propaganda piece for its pre-existing point of view. It is an interpretation that many might agree with. However, generating agreement does not make it true. That's my View From THL."
1,A jesuit book that will shake your foundation beliefs in Christ.,"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK.Unless you are a bible scholar, you will be decieved as you read this book. The author places his own interpretation on the bible verses which leads you to doubt who Christ was, His love for you, and the position He had in the trinity. Like Moses was a representative for Christ and Abraham was a representative for the Father, so is Melchizedek a representative of the High Priest (Christ). Melchizedek IS NOT Christ as the author would have you believe, but a representativ of Christ just as the lamb or the lion represented Christ. If you are curious what the order of Melchizedek is, read Heb 7:1-3 and Genesis 14:18-20. May God bless you and guide you."
4,Greatest Hits,"I like the songs that invite you to the dance floor (4 & 6), then once out there you ""Dusic"" with music by the Dazz Band. And that makes everyone ""Happy""."
3,The Only Brick CD Out There,"Like the title says, this is the only Brick cd currently available--the original albums don't seem to have ever been issued in this format, making a review a bit pointless in a way. I found it to be nice and funky when I first heard it and it's worth adding to your Disco/Funk collection. But then again, it's not like there's any other Brick stuff to compete with it, is there?"
2,"Satisfying CD, but not fulfilling.",The most sought after track (DAZZ) is not recorded in its entirety. The cover reflects a time of 5min 20sec but in fact it plays for 3min 15sec.
2,IT'S OK BUT SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING AS WELL,"There was plenty of time on this CD for them not to do what they did.First, they definitely could've added a few more cuts to the 12 they already have on this collection. There's nothing from the albums ""STONE HEART"", ""AFTER 5"" and the classic ""SUMMER HEAT"" which is a shame because there was alot of jamms on those albums.Then, ""DAZZ""; their most memorable song, is cut short.Still, since none of Brick's albums are out on CD; if you're a fan like I am, I guess you have no choice.Anyway, the jamms that are on the CD is a great selection none the less."
1,WEAK,"Brick's biggest hit, ""Dazz"" is spectacular in its long version, with its whistling/flute combo which I've never heard before or since in any musical genre. You'd think it would naturally be included on the greatest hits album, since they are essentially a one hit wonder. No such luck, as this compilation contains the short radio version of the song. ""Dusic"" is the only other song which is halfway decent, but hardly warrants shelling out $10. What a disappointment..."
3,Track Listing,"Since no one has done so and the back cover isnt shown....1. Dazz 5:352. Music Matic 3:003. Good High 3:114. Ain't gonna hurt nobody 3:545. Living from the mind 3:366. We don't wanna sit down, we wanna get down 5:417. Dusic 3:458. Push, push 3:469. All the way 4:1410. Don't ever lose your love 2:4711. Free 3:1012. Happy 4:23"
3,"Good, but Dazz fault is unforgivable","Tha album is good with most of the favorite Brick classics. Indeed, Dazz is the single version, plenty of room on the CD for both. Shame on Sony Music. If you want the full length version, check out Rhino's Millenium Funk Party CD. Full length Dazz, better source tape and/or mastering + 19 other well selected funk tunes."
4,way before atlanta was the soul mecca,yes i was sad by the fact dazz is less in time and what about sweat till you get wet from 81? that was one of ray parker jr's last great funky jams.but this disc will do better than nothing at all.another tight group from back in the day who had grooves for days.
3,Brick...,"I found this to be a good sample of their wares. Now, just give us the albums, and we'd be able to jam to their tunes at their full length! The versions on this album are just a little ""short."" Five stars for the music, but three stars for the disc!!"
2,"Regarding full-length ""Dazz"" by Brick","I bought ""Old School - Vol. 2"" specifically to get the full-length version of Dazz by Brick, among other songs. I was disappointed and angry that it was the 5 min. radio version. After reading your reviews here, I'm glad I didn't choose to get the Best of Brick. Though I enjoy other songs by Brick, Dazz is my all-time favorite. Today I found the long version on the ""Disco Super Hits"" CD. Though I'm not crazy about other songs on this CD it's worth the money. I will be playing my Dazz over and over with my sun-roof open, a smile on my face, and the wind blowing free in my hair! :-)"
1,This is NOT a Low Carb Cookbook,"This is a low fat/some good fat cookbook masquerading as a Low Carb cookbook. One dinner recipe Peasant Soup with Cheese Toast has more than 45 grams of carb per serving. Another dinner of Creole Chicken, Brown Rice and Watermelon tops out at more than 60 gr carbs for one serving. I honestly have not looked at each and every recipe, but just glancing through this books says it is not what it is titled."
5,"Fantastic cookbook for South Beach Diet, Zone, others!!","I love this cookbook! It fits my way of eating perfectly! If you are looking for a book with 3g of carbs per recipe or something than this isn't the one for you. However!!! there are so many other diets that can utilize this cookbook: South Beach, Zone, Atkins maintance, low-sugar diets, low-glycemic diets, and just general good health eating.Try it, you will like it! :)"
3,Fire Alarm,Fire Alarm was a good attempt for the first book of it's kind.Where it was lacking was in the other fire alarm companiesand pictures of their alarm equipment. Much more could have been included. I am sure The F.A.T.Book which will be in print inearly 2005 will address what Fire Alarm was missing.A book by a collector for the collector.
3,Some good points,"This book more or less covers topics instigated by the Elite that we all already know about. What interests me is the Nazi connection. I (we) all need to know more facts about how the SS cult survived the fall of the 3rd Reich, who they were, how they still exist (sans the cool uniforms),and most importantly, how they have infiltrated the American government, especially the Republican National Commitee and NASA. This book falls a little short of these details."
3,ONE OF THOSE LOVEABLE FIFTIES HORROR FLICKS,"This is one of the zillion Roger Corman horror flicks of the fifties in which normal creatures are turned into monsters thanks to you guessed it, nuclear energy. This time it's the bloodthirsty leech that gets the monster treatment, replete with actors in rubber leech suits. At a mercifully short 62 minutes, one doesn't have too much time to really fault this sometimes howlable horror. Ken Clark (a blond Clint Walker) is hopelessly deadpan and Yvette Vickers camps it up as the swamp slut. If you're an aficionado of the 50s giant bug movies, you'll have fun with this one."
4,In Another Life . . .,"I'm surprised Bruno the storekeeper/cuckolded husband lasted almost the entire length of the movie; he looks like he should have keeled over from the sauna-like weather down there in the swamp about 15 minutes into the movie. (Bruno had an itty-bit part as a night watchman in """"The Wasp Woman"" with Susan Cabot. He didn't make it thru his shift.) I'm surprised Ken Clark was in ""South Pacific."" From his acting here, the others may as well have been talking to a blank wall. I have a DVD of ""The 50 Foot Woman"" with Yvette Vickers doing commentary. She does a great job and sounds like someone you'd like to meet."
3,Hillbilly's and Leeches with laughs!!!,"The MST3K version is the version I saw and thatwas just watchable as I can't imagine sitting throughthis garbate without Joel and The Bots.Actually I would recommend the Mystery ScienceTheater version as The Bot Sketches are pretty damnfunny in this that you will die laughing with glee!!!The first sketch working with difficult peopleis a hoot.Ask for the movie itself, typically turkey, exceptwe now have dumb hillbilly's thrown into the mix,this was before the term white trash became popularin our society. The effects are laughable, but thiswhat this film is, a really bad movie that'llmake you laugh. There's a side story aboutsome stupid floozy cheating on her husband, butthe Leeches are the main attraction. At leastwe had some sort of setup with the death scenes.It's classic B-Movie cinema in action."
2,Poor Even for the Fifties!,"I am an avid fifties sci-fi buff, but this movie was really sadly put together even for back then. I gave it two stars because of the effort. It really could have been a great movie if it was for the ""special effects"" ... they were really special."
4,Leeches? What Leeches??,"OK, so there are some goofy hillbilly types running around the swamp, getting bled dry by gigantic leeches. Yes, the leeches are grown men wearing plastic trash bags. The hero is a living Ken doll. So what?! The ONLY reason to watch this flick is to see Yvette Vickers (Attack Of The 50 Foot Woman) in her underwear! She dances! She prances! She applies body-lotion! She parades about like the free-spirit she is! Hallelujah! I remember seeing her in this movie 33 years ago. I was 9 years old. I never forgot her! Buy this movie now..."
2,Poor White Trash Meets the Swamp Creatures,"If you try hard, you can find both positive and negative things to say of this movie. One definite plus is Yvette Vickers, who looks good in leopard-skin underwear. The tawdry little plot is a combination of Erskine Caldwell style southern lust and adultery portrayed against the background of a 1950s/early 1960s low-budget sci-fi flick. Some of the supporting characters resemble the ""gloom, despair, and misery"" guys from TV's Hee Haw. There are atomic-size leeches in the local swamp. The authorities are baffled when local-yocals mysteriously disappear. As in many of these old sci-fi flicks, the script wastes time having the various characters dispute that anything unnatural is going on, and then arguing over how to deal with the problem.Ultimately, this movie can either be totally disregarded, or taken as unintentional humor. I usually have a weakness for movies that are ""so-bad-they're-good,"" hence the 2 stars rating. Others beware."
2,Fun movies poorly mastered,"These two films are from the Corman production mill. Roger directed A Bucket of Blood, which is a very entertaining (and brief) satire on coffeehouse/beatnik art pretensions. The Giant Leech movie has a couple of funny scenes with Bruno veSota and Yvette Vickers but otherwise falls flat. The print of A Bucket of Blood used for this DVD starts off very badly; it's choppy and distracting from the wonderful opening monologue (""I will talk to you of art, for there is nothing else to talk about...""). Worse, the sound quality is muffled, and it sounds like noise reduction was applied to a master tape that wasn't recorded with Dolby - instead of removing hiss, all the high and low tones are reduced to a flat middle-range. Sometimes it's difficult to understand the dialogue for this reason. The MGM VHS release looks and sounds better than this DVD, but of course, that tape comes without Attack of the Giant Leeches..."
4,"Good, but not great.","It is a collection of essays across the years. As usual in a book like this, it is uneven. Some essays are funny, inspiring, hard-hitting, others are dull. I found the best essays were when he was describing the desert Southwest. The worst were those where he was talking about the art of writing. All in all, I was glad I bought this book. It has enough good in it to overcome the bad. Thus, it is rated a 4, although some of the essays were 5's, other's were 3's."
2,An Incompetent and Misleading Piece of Publishing,"This edition advertises itself as ""The Pulitzer Prize Biography."" It is not. It is an abridged 1955 reissue that also omits the footnotes and bibliography. To add to the deception, the copyright page lists the date as 1931 -- again, a misrepresentation, since the book includes a note from the author written in 1955. Poor Mr. Pringle, unaware of the fate that awaited him at the hands of Konecky and Konecky, states therein that the notes and bibliography may be sought in the original edition, which is, of course, now out of print. Konecky should never have brought forth an abridgment instead of the original. This edition may be all right for the casual reader, but it is very nearly useless to scholars of the history of biography. Pshaw!!"
2,Almost a Dream...,"When I first saw the title ""The Movie Posters of Drew Struzan"". I thought it was the Movie posters... Movie poster looks better with the titles and fine prints. As much as I loved Drew's work but somehow I still would have prefer it in a Movie poster format, not just the art piece. It was the reason I bought this book after the same mistake I did when I purchased ""Drew Struzan: Oeuvre"".I hope Drew will publish a book with the true collection of the posters... not just the art..."
2,bad printing?,"Great book - except for page 12, which appears to be misprinted. It starts with the last few words of a sentence ""...Scott's Blade Runner."" From there it goes on to discuss Drew's art for that film. However, the art shown is a detail from his poster for THE GOONIES. I returned the book to amazon for a replacement, but the replacement was flawed as well (and so it too, was returned). That may or may not be a dealbreaker for you. It was for me. Otherwise, the book is great and makes a great companion to THE ART OF DREW STRUZAN."

5,Great book to read soon after loss.,I received the book at the hospital with other mementos of my still born son. It took me a couple of days before I was able to read it. It was a great first book to read because it was all I could handle at the time. It included some beautiful poems and discusses how you may be feeling. It doesn't go in depth on alot of issues so if you are looking in depth discussions this is not the book for you.
3,A book about the trauma parents face when a newborn dies.,"This book contains excerpts written by parents who have had their joy stolen by the death of a baby. It includes neonatal death, stillbirth, and death before birth, and the inspired poems and real stories these parents have written in their anguish serve as catharsis for those who suddenly find themselves thrust into similar situations. This insightful book should be required reading for any parent faced with the horror of coping with the loss of a tiny one so new and already dear to their heart."
1,C'mon Amazon! Give us samples we can use!!!,"The one star is for the preview only.I downloaded the sample so that I could compare Young's translation to others. THE ENTIRE SAMPLE consisted of the introduction. How am I supposed to get an accurate sense of the work from that? Unfortunately, this sort of sampling is all too common on Amazon. I will obviously have to find this work elsewhere to evaluate whether I want to buy it or not.C'mon guys, you do so much well. fix this!"
4,very nice piece of guitar work,"Although I'am a 80's metal thrash head (metallica like lover) I do love virtuouso guitar work, and I must say...even though george lynch who is coming from a 80's hair metal band dokken, this man can truly rip a new a-hole to his listeners with his attack on the axe. I also have sacred grooove which I like a little more but with 3 instrumental tracks and a awesome version of Ozzy and the late Randy Rhoads' 'Mr.Crowley' he definitely does justice to the song. Also in reading his booklet he has comments on each song which is cool. My favorite track on this cd would have to be number 12, 11 is also a close second. Hope this helps."
3,A collection of George Lynch Oddities,"This is a collection of rare tracks, many cover-tunes in the vein of his ""Curious George"" album. Standout tracks include Mr. Crowley, Rollin And Tumblin, and Train Keeps A Rollin'. There a few left-over Lynch Mob tracks, but they are among the album's weakest songs (there was a reason they were left off the original Lynch Mob albums). Kudos to George for tackling a variety of classic rock tracks, some with more success than others. The variety of the types of tracks on the album make it a relatively discontinous listen but there are some gems. The soloing on Mr. Crowley is a particular standout and it is almost worth buying the whole album just for that track."
2,Boy Scouts Merit Badge book,"This book is all information and merit badge requirements. I completed the merit badge, so I found it pretty useful. But if you were just to read through it page by page, it would be mind-numbingly boring."
4,Could Have a Few More Things,"I am very satisfied with this dvr. This dvr is missing a few things, like a CableCard slot for easier recorder timing. This has a feature that I like alot which is to edit parts of what you have recorded. This could have a DV and HDMI output and multiple component outputs to record in Hi Definition and upconvert TV and DVDs to 1080i. I recommend this to people who like to spend extra time on recording and are not looking for an easy way out."
4,Great recorder,Loved this DVR. The only thing that I don't like about it is that it doesn't have the OPEN/CLOSE button on the remote control.
4,Fast Burner,"I bought this product for use by our AV department at church. After a month of using the product, we view it as a great asset to our transition from VHS to DVD. The learning curve was about 2 weeks, but in the product's defence (and the men in the AV department), that represents only a few hours of hands-on experience. We are very impressed with the speed of the burner. Also, picture quality is still very good, even with 4 hours on a disc. I recommend this product."
5,Great equipment to own,"I like this recorder very much. I have only used the hard drive, not the DVD, and it works very well, is easy to operate and the picture quality is very good."
4,good features,dvd recorder w/ nice features. somewhat complicated and not too user friendly menus. requires some reading done before understanding how to work those many features it offers. still happy w/ a purchase. it's a Pioneer afterall
3,Pioneer DVR-640H-S DVD Recorder with 160GB DVR,"all the negative reviews seen thus far are right on the money. pioneer is awful for dvr's. for the $ and even w/its flaws (and panasonic dvrs have flaws b/c i've got 2 of 'em), panasonic is the better buy. title deletion is ridiculous (what moron programmed it to do that?) and the screen is so 'busy' it's just anti-user-friendly. i'm lucky i received as gift so i didn't spend my hard-earned $ on it. only upside of having this product is i know to remove 'Pioneer' from my shortlist of DVR brands to purchase in the future."
1,never received this Item it was cancelled,"I would like to purhase this item or another like it, if and when one becomes available please email me"
1,Unit came as advertised,I have enjoyed using my Pioneer DVR-640H-S DVD recorder. It'sability to record to dual layer disks make it an indispensableaddition to any videophile. I recommend it to anyone.
5,Learn Writing from a Dog....Fun way to teach kids,"After taking many writing classes on ""how to teach kids to write""...I stumbled across James Howe's new series, ""Tales From the House of Bunnicula""...and I began to learn how to teach writing, from a dog. The whole time I was reading the book, lesson plans popped into my head... ""I could use this to teach simile...or that would make a great lesson on 'cliffhangers', or when and how to use adjectives...and this part would show what 'literary license' means..... the book is full of laugh-out-loud humor. I can't wait to share these tales with my fourth grade students. Jame Howe's books are not only fun to read, but you soon realize that you can learn a lot from a dog...and from great authors. This is a Howling Success, I know I'll be using them in my classroom."
2,Just didn't care for it,"I usually like scary books, especially suspenseful scary books, but this was neither. It was dark and slow with a fairly predictable, unrealistic ending."
2,Struggled with it,"I had a hard time with this book. The writing was good and the story was good, but there were too many parts that didn't hold my attention. I got nearly done with it and then didn't pick it up for nearly a week."
2,Had promise.,"The basis of the story interested me. However, I had to force myself to read it to the end. Predictable, trite, and slow moving."
4,A great little find,"I didn't know what to expect with this book as I had just bought my kindle and thought surely for the price it will be rubbish but actually it was a really good story, done a million times ok but still well written and worth a read."
3,REALLY?? Terrible ending,"I thought it began as a good story, but then the author ended it abruptly..like he was trying to write a short story for his 6th grade class and realized it was already too long. Very disappointing. But that is why it is .99"
4,good read,"Im only giving this 4 stars because of the long chapters. I have been spoiled because I read alot of james patterson, notabley they alex cross series. His chapters are only 3 to 5 pages so it makes you read just one more over and over again because they are so short."
2,Not at all scary,"I was hoping to enjoy this book, judging from the reviews, but it wasn't very good and it wasn't at ALL scary. There's no way I would call this a ""horror"" novel; I've read a lot of horror and this doesn't qualify. It's sort of a mystery with a supernatural flavor. The drawbacks: 1) characters are very one-dimensional (so the reader doesn't even care if they are killed), 2) the ""bad guy"" is known from the very start, 3) the dialogue is stilted. I could go on, but suffice it to say that I would recommend this book only if you have nothing else to read and are pretty desperate."
2,Book,I did not like the story. I read whole book to find out how it ends. Just not my type of reading.
2,Too much,"While, well written, this book was just a bit too much for me. Not for those with a weak stomach!"
4,The Red Church,Well this is more like a preview than a review but I just gotta say: I am four or five chapters in and have to keep reminding myself this is not Stephen King.I'll be back after I finish to do this right. Assuming I can either update this review or post a second on the same title.
4,Great until the end,I loved this book. It kept me reading the whole time. The only thing I was disappointed with was the ending. Could have gave a little more explanation about what the thing really was.
4,The Red Church,"A very strange and unusual story. A red Church, ghosts, a creature that lives in the bell tower, and a Reverend who is not what you think."
2,Red Church Turned Out to be a Red Herring,I was excited by the book's description and it was free. That's enough for me to download it. Pretty much a waste of time. Predictable and trite. Plot was only skin-deep and not worth the effort to even finish it.
3,Disappointing ending,"This is the first Scott Nicholson I have read and was excited to find a new author with high reviews. I love a good mystery, rich characters, and twists and turns. This story has all of that, but goes too far in an unbelievable ending. I felt maybe the author just got tired of the writing and decided to wrap it up, quickly, without the same care as the beginning."
2,some good elements but ultimately disappointing,"This is the first Nicholson book I've read and I'll be in no rush to read another. Along with the commonality of the dark subject matter, his writing style is very similar to Stephen King. Almost too similar. But while Stephen King was always a master storyteller, roping me in and keeping me enthralled into the wee hours with his best works, The Red Church seemed to drag on and by the time I got 2/3 through I had to force myself to finish it. The book has its good moments and captivating elements, but the story and overall experience never lived up to its potential in my opinion. Some other reviews have commented on religious implications - I am non-religious so I found nothing offensive nor redeemable in the author's musings in this regard, however I enjoy spiritual exploration and the lack of any meaningful impact considering the substantial verbiage spent here is a good example of how this book falls short."
2,Not so great,"I just could not get into it. I managed to finish it, but it was a struggle. I did not find it to be the least bit scary or suspenseful. The ending seemed completely arbitrary, and I did not think it flowed logically from the story. It was supposed to be based on a dark interpretation of christian theology, but the belief system portrayed as Christianity would not be believed by anyone over the age of 10. ""the exorcist"" pulled this off pretty well, but not this one. I was in the mood for a spooky page-turner, but was disappointed. At least it was only 99 cents, but it turned out to be overpriced."
3,An OK read.,The book started out great. But as I read I became more and more disenchanted with it until I realized I was only forcing myself to finish the book rather than eager to do it.
3,OK,A little too weird for me. I thought there was going to be more of a Christian message but it was just weirdness.
4,Great Read!,Very good read! It was hard to put it down once I got started. I enjoyed it so much I am on the lookout for more books by this author.
2,The Red Church,MMMMM. This isn't one of my favorite books. I like horror and supernatural novels but this on missed the mark with me.
4,Good and Evil,"Very good tale of Good and Evil. A good read written very well. Not generally my type of book but I will definitely read more by this author, have already downloaded a few more waiting in line to read. For it to be classified a Thriller/Horror book it also could have easily been Christian as well. It was funny because the way he described the small town and the people was well done, I actually heard them speaking right off the page which made me laugh."
4,Horror like it is meant to be,"A very creepy horror novel that explores ideas of faith, redemption, good vs. evil and how hard it is to tell the difference, and other such thoughts. This is my first Nicholson book and I'm quite impressed not only by his mastery of language but by his character development, plot development, and clean copy editing. Fans of horror and those fascinated by the eternal struggle to understand the human condition should enjoy this novel. Please keep an eye open for my review of the sequel, ""Drummer Boy."""
4,"Well written, fun read","Nicholson's gift for language comes through in this early novel. The descriptors, particularly for the more visceral scenes, are inspired. Fun story and a good summer read.I look forward to reading more from him.Greg SmithAuthor,Final Price"
3,Something Happens In Every Chapter,"I did ""Just-Like"" the story. It starts off really sweet & something really does happen in every chapter. However, Nicholson's Writing is just OK. And the Ending Was Really, Very Weird."
4,The Red Church Rocks!,"This was my first Scott Nicholson novel, and I really enjoyed it. The author is a gifted storyteller, and his style of writing made this story stand out.The story of a haunted church and its history unfold from the perspective of a handful of wonderfully drawn characters. Some are afraid of the church, its past, its legend, and the recent murders surrounding it. Other characters are followers of a charismatic preacher, intent on reopening the church and gathering up the old congregation so that a new chapter can be added to its dreadful past.No single character stands out as the ""main"" character, but they all have a distinctive perspective, along with unique fears based on their personal history with the church and the legend that surrounds it.Smart, fast, and frightening, the Red Church was a great read. I'm happy to be a new fan of Scott Nicholson and will check out his other titles.Donnie Light, author of Dark Justice, Ripper's Row and The Hotel California"
3,"A good read, but ....","People really want to believe in a good ghost story.I jumped into this book, because it seemed like it had it all, a good story and a good monster to fuel it. It hits the ground running, and keeps the pacing perfect. The characters are believable, and over all it is very well written. It keeps you turning the pages, and a lot of horror stories can't accomplish that for me.I only have two problems with the book. I don't really believe it paints the picture of Appalachian life that other reviewers claim it does. This is not the writer's fault, but more one of my own expectations.The other bee in my bonnet about the Red Church is that the monster isn't as scary as I would have liked him to be. He is not written as charismatic, or as menacing as the character really needed to be.I recommend that horror fans read this book, but don't believe the hype."
3,not a bad read,"I decided to read this book after I read the reviews about it being sooooo scary. The book was okay, the story was well told, but not scary at all. I'm sure that is just me, I was just disappointed when I was expecting scary and got mildly creepy. Did not keep me on the edge of my seat the way I like, but for 2.99 it wasn't much of a loss."
3,Preachy,I thought the story was okay but not fantastic. the part about Ronnie's experience in the Baptist church was good. It was truthful in how pushy they can be. The end of the book was very preachy. The ending was disappointing.
3,Too much blasphemy,"While it hurts me to say this, since I was so fond of ""Speed dating with the dead"", this book just contains way too much blasphemy of the works of Jesus, for a born again Christian to enjoy it. Love the author, his writing skills, but definately NOT THE BLASPHEMY OF JESUS. And the end was wayyyyyyy disappointing. The book was too dark and too evil. It slanders Jesus, and credits the devil. AND YES, WHILE I REALIZE THIS IS SIMPLY A WORK OF FICTION, it was too disturbing for me to enjoy. Sorry...."
2,"Interesting premise, disappointing development","At first I was intrigued by the apparent premise of the book, a cult's belief in the idea of a ""second son"" of God who was a rival of Jesus and has come to earth to correct Jesus' mistakes. But this interesting idea quickly becomes lost in a befuddling tangle of ghost story, curses, creatures, and caricatures. I read it all the way through, both because I hate to not know how any book ends once I've started it and because I kept hoping that the author would pull the story out of the fire. I was disappointed."
3,interesting plot,"There were quite a few things to like about this book. The plot was something I hadn't seen before and was originally what drew me into reading this novel. The structure was good and I really liked some of the characters. I was happily reading along until the middle section of the book, when I found that the pace slowed a bit. When things got rolling again, I felt there was a bit too much all at once. For the most part, this was a good book and I agree that it falls neatly into the horror category. I wasn't so much frightened by the events in the book as intrigued. Overall I thought this was a good effort and look forward to reading further works by this author."
3,The Red Church...,"This was not my normal genre but I was looking for something different and the cover caught my eye. It was just okay, the religion aspect of this story just did not sit well with me. It did keep my attention and kept me focused though. I did find this author's style of writing sometimes confusing, I would give this author another try though!"
2,Disappointing,"While overall the writing style was enjoyable, the story simply intensified in it's non-sensical nature as the book progressed, leaving the reader confused, unsatisfied, and feeling like potential was lost for a satisfying ending. It began as fairly believable but rapidly became far-fetched at a pace that tried to say ""There is more to this story than their seems"" but merely contrasted uncomfortably with the attempts to give logical reasons for some of the happenings."
1,Boring,"Finished the book only to find out if the good guys won, almost didn't but didn't have anything else to read at the time."
5,Kept me up!!,"I'm not a huge Nicholson fan, but this book was a page turner. (It also kept me up past 3am for other reasons.)So creepy. So good.I might just become a Nicholson fan after all."
4,Good verses evil,"This is my first Scott Nicholson book, so had no idea what to expect. It started out vaguely reminiscent of James Patterson, but then moved into supernatural...GORY supernatural. Ronnie Day, and his Brother, Tim, side-track into the cemetery at the dreaded Red Church, where they discover items belonging to Boonie Houck. Strange. But not nearly as strange as being grabbed by a bloody, torn up Boonie. If Ronnie was afraid of the Red Church, he's REALLY afraid now!This is about evil, in it's worst form, and the effects it has on a small, backwoods community. It's about salvation, or the lack of such, good & evil. If you aren't into reading about salvation, be warned that this talks about Jesus and evil. It's about ""the Second Son"" of God, as seen in the eyes of Archer McFall. It's creepy, gory, and edge-of-your-seat reading.I have to add, here, that this is NOT, in any way, true, except at the very end, where Ronnie finally REALLY accepts the Lord as his Savior."
4,Great start!,"I love the premise behind this book. It takes things that scare us from childhood and makes them bigger, which makes them that much scarier as adults. Especially when it comes to going to church. Who hasn't been scared by all the brainwashing tactics they can use? The only thing I noticed is that during the marital spat between David and Linda the conversation dragged out a little more than it should have. But other than that I just loved the book! Can't wait to read the others."
1,Glad it was cheap!,"Here's the deal... if you read Stephen King or John Saul (his later books --- not the good ones).... you will probably like this novel. If you're not into characters turning into illogical, supernatural ""things,"" then don't waste your money. For some reason, I thought the supernatural connotations would be logically explained in the end... but nope, it was just unbelievable junk. The book wasn't spooky, scary or anything else... just another Stephen King wannabe..."
2,Did Not Like It,"The plot is strange. The writing is mediocre at best. Comparing this author to King or Koontz is a joke. He is not even in the same league. The ending is sudden with a very ""Huh?"" like quality. The monster is NOT scary. The dialogue does not flow smoothly. I can't believe so many people liked this book! The only good things I have to say about it is that is was short and it only cost a dollar to download it to my Nook. If you want to read something scary read (or re-read)Stephen King's ""Salem's Lot"", one of the finest and scariest horror novels ever written (in my humble opinion). It will be time much better spent, even if you have already read it!"
4,Give me that old time Terror!,Chills are plenty in Scott Nicholson's debut horror novel! A red church in a small town in north carolina houses a ancient evil! ...Nicholson's chilling horror novel's theme of religious fanaticism that sometimes dwells in rural towns and the scenes of terror are described in ghoulish detail!the characters are very memorable ... Zombies and ghosts also are some of the elements in this chiller. The novel ends with one of the creepy finals in I've ever read as you find out source of the evil that resides in the red church. Unforgettable tale of terror!
2,Hard To Finish,"With the exception of a few parts of the book, I was dissappointed. The description of the novel did not indicate that it has a Christian based theme, it therefore comes across as a bit preachy and over emphasized to the point of redundancy. Never able to connect with the characters didn't help matters. As opposed to other complaints with the ending, that was one part that I found worthy of the drudgery of slogging through the story. As a Christian, I understand that the darkness is just as eternal as the light."
5,"A very good read, but keep the lights on!!","A great scary story. Keeps you wanting more, and checking the shadows over your shoulders. Has a very Stephen King-ish feel to it. I will definitely be reading more from Scott Nicholson. Keep up the good work!!"
1,THE RED CHURCH,I PURCHASED THE BOOK ON MOSTLY EVERYONE'S REVIEW. I PURCHASE THE BOOK ALMOST 2 WEEKS AGO. I AM STILL READING IT I AM SORRY BUT IT IS BORING AS HELL.
5,"So dark ,,, so interesting!!!",Scott Nicholson keeps this one so dark and scary ... wow!! you won't look at church congregations the same!!! Great horror reading!! Loved it from the start!!!
1,I suffered through,I downloaded 3 boxed sets of Scott Nicholson and this was the first book I read. I sent those sets to the archives after reading this first book.
3,Great atmosphere but a let-down in the end,"Without repeating the synopses that other reviewers have written, I do credit Mr. Nicholson with creating a great mood for his novel. The premise and setting have promise and I found myself avoiding reading the novel late at night due to the mood it evoked.However, the characters are somewhat shallow and very predictable. The ending leaves a very empty, unsatisfied feeling. Things get wrapped up too simply and neatly without a clear idea of why the characters were put through the travails that they suffered.The craftsmanship here is promising but the end product prevents it from being a stand-out.Now that the book is available in paperback, it's worth the buy to see for yourself."
1,Horrible,What more can I say... my title for my review states it all.... worst book I ever read. Didn't even want to finish it but I always finish what I start and I totally regretted it. What a waste of time.
1,THIS. WAS. BAD.,"I have a rule that I must finish a book once I have started it. That rule got broken with this book - IT SUCKED!!!! I wonder if I was reading the same book as everyone that gave it 4 or 5 stars. This book was compared to the writings of Dean Koontz or Stephen King. REALLY.....come on!! I read about 25 pages and was so confused, irritated, and disgusted that I had to stop. If you want to torture yourself and waste money.....no wait, that's not even fair. Just skip it and keep moving. I wasted my time. You shouldn't have to waste yours too."
1,Can't give it less...,This was the first and LAST book written by Scott Nicholson I will ever read. I cannot have read the same book as those who rated it so highly! I hate to not finish a book and had to force myself to get thru this one... time I will never get back... what a waste!
1,lured into reading,"I was lured into reading this book by the 92 positive reviews. I found it distasteful and inane. I stopped reading ""horror"" books long ago, after reading King's ""Cujo"" and being so disturbed by the child's death in the book. I should have stayed away from the genre. This book had no moral lessons that I could determine and the usual graphic violence. Not for me."
2,Disappointing,"After all the rave reviews for this book, I hate to be the spoiler, but I really didn't care for this book. The premise sounded interesting, the reviews were great, and the price was right, so I tried it. As I read, I kept waiting for the ideas to come together in some sort of coherent whole, or at least resolve some of the ambiguities, but it never did.This ""horror"" book that may have worked thirty years ago when readers were less sophisticated and less demanding, but it didn't work for me now. The writing was almost lyrical at times when describing the countryside and the mood, but the plot was rambling and very unconvincing. After reading some of the descriptions, I thought, ""O.K., now it's going to get good,"" but it didn't. And it didn't scare me either. It bored me.I think this author has talent and may come up with some great writing in the future. But not now. At least, not in my opinion."
2,"decent ride, but ouch! what a lousy ending","OK, I gave this book 2 stars because the author demonstrates fairly stong writing skills throughout, and I agree that it is a good first novel, EXCEPT - and I hate to say this, but the ending was just awful, just...bad. I stayed up late to finish it last night, and was left with such a sour taste in my mouth from the last pages that it was hard to sleep. The best analogy I can think of to describe how bad it was is to compare it to the recent ""Planet of the Apes"" remake. If you happened to see that, you probably remember how the ending was just confusing and totally out of context with the rest of the movie; ditto with this book. My advice? Check it out from the library if you must read it, or borrow a copy, but don't waste your money."
3,Interesting,Not a book I would normally read not a bad book just different. Will read another from Scott Nicholson then I will have a better idea.
1,The Red Church,Too much nonsense and repetition of the same phrases. It just became silly. Must have had a requirement for a certain number of words.
2,Uuuhm!,"Not his best. I found it disjointed and repetitive. However, I finished it and was never tempted to move on."
2,Strange and bizzare book,"Very freaky. Was not impressed or interested, I know my soul will be going to heaven to spend eternity with God."
3,the red church,The Red Church was an ok read. It was not what I expected. Just a little too off the wall for me. Wouldn't read it again.
1,Couldn't finish it....,"Based on the reviews i was expecting to have a good read - please folks. The book was so bad that i never even finished it which it totally out of character. The plot was hard to follow, the characters never developed and the editing left much to be desired !! Finally came to conclusion about halfway through that i didn't even care what was going to happen. Don't bother with this one - not sure about the others written by him as there seem to be many........"
4,A Reader's Opinion,"As an unpublished writer, my opinion on writing styles and formats and first books is probably not worth a grain of salt to anyone reading this review. HOWEVER, as a reader of many, many, MANY horror and suspense novels, short stories and the like--I think my opinion may be worth much more. I thoroughly enjoyed reading Scott Nicholson's book, The Red Church, so much so that I have already put his upcoming book, The Harvest, at the top of this years Christmas list. I enjoyed reading this book because I felt there were many twists and turns--you weren't really sure which supernatural force was truly responsible for the haphazard demise of this small mountain town and most importantly--you cared about what happened to the boys. I found this to be a fun read and would recommend it highly to anyone looking to sample a new writer's work."
4,"Not Bad, Not Bad at All...","I picked up this book at DragonCon when it came out so that I would have a little something to keep me occupied in my hotel room. I just wanted a light read by an author whom I had never heard of. This seemed like a perfect little book for the occasion.I was not disapointed. It took me 2 or 3 days to read and it held my interest. Religion is a spooky subject in my opinion anyway. I will have to admit that I found the ending a little anti-climatic, but the trip there is charming (in a horror type way).It isn't a literary masterpiece by any means, you can tell it is a first timer's effort. I think that Scott Nicholson has a lot of potential though, and The Red Church was good enough that I am interested in reading more novels by this author."
5,perfect part,Easy to install. Had all the needed diections on its location and thus became easy. Bought 2 so that next year I have one available. Sure beats the dealships price by getting 2 parts for less than 1 at the dealship.
5,"CD illustration is correct, album tracks/music samples are not.","I own the album illustrated from rewind records.When I bought it, it was not an import.The music samples & track titles that amazon provided appear to be from some jazz fusion album,(not from the actual Airborne CD I own A27569 (REWIND 55019-2).The correct album tracks are as follows:1. The lady knows best2. feel like lovin'3. ghost of love4. wastin' my time5. no exception to the rule6. soldier of fortune7. that's where my love goes8. life in the city9. stand up10. optimysticalAnd the genre format is soft-rock to light progressive, if you didn't know whothe group was, you might think you were listening to a bit of Styx mixed in with some tracks that sound exactly like early Journey, (music only, I'm not going to assume that the singer sounds at all like Steve Perry) from the same time period, (late 70's).Both of which were main staples of AOR FM radio in the late 70's early 80's."
5,Una historia de amor imposible,Tuve la suerte de poder conseguir esta pelicula en DVD. Una magnifica historia escrita de manera muy inteligente y con enfasis en la imagen por sobre las palabras. una historia de amor para identificarse. Muy recomendable.
1,Caution,"I applied Hartz Flea & Tick to my dog right before taking him on a 2-week camping trip in Baja California, Mexico. Within a couple days, he couldn't wag his tail--it just hung limp. While I don't know for sure, I suspected the Hartz Flea & Tick drops which I applied along his spine and base of his tail, where he gets more fleas. Being out in the middle of nowhere, I couldn't take him to a vet, but his tail function returned to normal gradually within 2 days and he's fine now.When I returned home, I related what happened to a vet friend of mine and she warned me against using Hartz products because they have an atrocious safety record.Bottom line: I was looking to save a couple bucks by using the cheaper Hartz flea drops and figured that if it has regulatory approval and is on the market, it must be safe. Wrong. Please do some research on the safety of this product before putting it on your dog."
4,Not just for Armenians; Not just for classical music fans,"This documentary offers a unique perspective on the Armenian experience. Through the eyes, voice and heart of a highly accomplished classically trained Canadian soprano who is Armenian by heritage, the viewer gains insights into the history, culture and realities of today's Armenia.This film will have enormous appeal to diasporan Armenians - those who dream of visiting the Republic of Armenia one day, and those who have already been to their ""homeland"" or even live there now. If their eyes don't fill with tears at some point during the film, I'd be surprised.For those of us who are NOT Armenian, this film offers lessons in history, geography, and the true essence of music and musicianship. I don't doubt that many will be inspired by the movie and by Ms. Bayrakdarian to visit this ancient land someday soon.Beautifully shot and recorded, gorgeous and moving to watch."
5,Insight on soprano Isabel Baldakdarian's visit to Armenia,"I enjoyed this videa so much. First, one gets a sense of Ms. Baldakdarian's enthusiastic personality and thought processes, and good footage of her lovely singing, mainly of armenian vocal compositions (Gomidas) recorded in various historic sites, accompanied with traditional armenian instruments. The main closing scene is of her performing a western operatic solo on stage with full orchestra. The DVD 'extras' give more of her performing both genres. Secondly, one gets some insight on the physical layout and cultural beauty and history of Armenia. Thirdly, the video is very professional and beautifully executed."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is a big waste of money! This is a shareware program which is not stated ANYWHERE on the box. After you think you've installed it, you'll find out the only way to play one of the games is to register and pay a fee (between $2-$15) for EACH game. How frustrating since this is not conveyed on the box!!!"
3,The writing is bland but the story is incredible,"Human beings are capable of incredibly noble acts when they are faced with the most terrifying circumstances. Such was the case with Lt. John F. Kennedy in command of PT 109 in the South Pacific during WWII. Faced with the alternative of action or death he rose to the occasion and was able to save the lives of his shipmates through great physical trauma and hardship.Without going into the details of the incidents described, I would merely say that this is a good example of what the best of us are capable of doing when forced to think and act or face death. If stories of this kind interest you, this book will gratify your desires."
4,"It's a Fact, JFK was a Brave Young Guy","He didn't join the national guard, he didn't get a deferrment with the help of his rich father, he didn't let the navy know about his bad health. He volunteered to go to war, and it nearly killed him.Like so many others, John Kennedy was a 20-something who joined the US Navy in WWII, but unlike many others he had the chance to prove he was a truly brave man. (A fact Kennedy-hating historical revisionists have refused to acknowledge.)... But read this dramatic story, if only to learn about an early, interesting exercise in JFK's inner fortitude - the same one that later saved the world in the Cuban Missle crisis."
1,It... bored ... me ...to ...death,"Just like I said in the title, this book bored me to my death it really sucked, I hated it."
5,John F. Kennedy and PT-109,"This was an exciting book on John F. Kennedy. It had lots of action, and suspence. John F. Kennedy had a lot of willpower, that was surprising. The bravery was outstanding in this story. If you like action and adventure I could not recommend a better book. I gave this book a five star rating, because it was truely a good book. Even though this was an old book, it was exciting. This would be a very good book for kids, because there was not a lot of hard words."
3,Great for Sword lovers especially HIGHLANDER,"The Awataguchi Shinto School of Sword Making IS A GREAT BOOK if you are collecting sword or having one ,if you want to make a sword this book is not for you cause details are less,but to maintian a sword like sharpness and free from dust and BLOOD ...he he...., if you are in sword collection go for it anyway"
2,Not as good as other...,"Bought the Japanese version but think the contents are the same for the English one...I have been a fan of Terasawa since the early 80s and I must say, the GOKU series is probably the worst of his books. The stories are pretty weak(unimaginative and repetitive) compared to his other works like COBRA and KABUTO--and the ""Neo-Tokyo"" setting gets tiring after a while, along with too much pointless sex (waaay more then his other series. Dunno if he's trying to compete with HeavyMetal Magazine or something, lol). If you're a diehard fan of Terasawa then get this. If not then go buy his other books."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"Gamebox 1.0 is one of those movies I had to see, simply to find out what it was all about. The story seemed like such a unique concept that i was sure it would be something exciting. I was pretty disappointing thou, being that it was direct to video and probably had a small budget, the special effects were pretty lame. The background story was actually pretty good. However, it was buried under cheesy special effects and performed by Sabrina and Boy Meets World outcasts, that are all grown up, so it was hard to tell. After thinking about it a little, I could see where they were going. Overall, it was ok, pretty much just a direct to video version of a failed movie with a similar story line, Stay Alive. Pass on this one!"
1,P U,"Save your money, if you have the time, go outside and watch fire ants eat. It will be a lot more satisfying than this bomb."
3,It's Ok,"It's got its moments. Not to bad for a low budget film. Feels almost like it's from the 80s. It looks kind of crummy but I think it was intentional to give the feel of it being in a video game. It's an ok rental, think twice about actually buying. And it's definately better than most other low budget films such as Raptor Island (A very crappy movie)."
3,;0),"Good concept but presentation was not wel executed. It's about a guy who loses his girlfriend is already feeling depress, he then gets a package with a virtual game and now he is trapped I. The game and needs to finish the game to come out alive. As I said concept is not bad but graphics and presentation could have been wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy better this was made in 2004 that's no excuse for bad graphics"
3,Condition was quite misleading,"I did receive exactly the ISBN that I asked for, and for that I am quite thankful. This book was used and was represented as being in like new condition. When I received it there were obvious signs of use - ruffled corners, etc. There were unsightly glue marks on front where a label an attempt to remove previous used label had taken place - could have been cleaned up for better presentation - also several quite unsightly USED labels on back. Maybe an OK source if you are not that concerned about condition of book."
2,simplistic and incomplete,"I purchased this atlas based on the many positive reviews here on Amazon. Unfortunately I have to conclude that either these reviews were planted by the publisher or the reviewers were not very well educated about the American civil war. This so-called comprehensive atlas almost completely ignores the trans-Mississippi theater, and only gives the major western campaign battles a cursory glance. No Wilson's creek, Pea ridge, Val verde, Honey springs, etc etc....not what I was looking for at all from such a well rated publication."
4,"Solid, Informative Guide","This nicely informative map-book is a practical companion for everybody from novices and casual readers to Civil War buffs. Author Craig Symonds covers 50 major battles of the Civil War, conveniently placing the map on the left side (even page) and the readable battle synopsis on the right side (odd page). That synopsis is clear, concise, and surprisingly informative, with information on overall campaigns, strategies, weather, commanders, results, even luck. The maps are nearly as good, although some readers may need practice a bit with the Key to Battle Symbols located by the Introduction. The book covers most battles in this convenient open-page style, but a couple vital struggles like Gettysburg and Vicksburg have more than one set of dual pages. The book doesn't cover every major battle, but presents most of them in about 120 nicely readable pages. A few hardcore buffs may want even more, but this remains an excellent resource. Nicely informative, and nicely done."
4,Good Look at Exodus,"This book takes you on a chapter by chapter revelation of the book of Exodus. However, it is also related to each believer's life and the journey to get closer to God. There are many truths in this book and revelations. Exodus has never been so exciting before reading this book. Now I am interested in hearing revelations from the Lord about Exodus for myself."
3,Too short. Not much dancing done. :-(,"I was expecting to do more dancing as an exercise, instead I was doing sit ups and stretches. I'm a little dissapointed. I wanted to shake my hips more! :-) It's also only 31 minutes. I wanted to sweat more!!!"
4,"Good,fun workout","The title is a little deceptive,since there is very little in the way of actual belly dancing.However,the movements are pretty easy,and the workout seems to go by fast.I would reccomend this tape to anyone who is looking for a good workout to tone muscle,but if you want belly dance instructions,this is not what you want."
2,Gets Old Fast,"I have had this DVD for a few years and for the majority of that time it has been sitting untouched in a drawer. The whole idea of a belly dance workout sounds really fun, but this is just boring. There is waaaaay too much repetition of the moves in this video. It feels like you are doing the same thing over and over again. I get so bored with this video I can't even make it all the way through.As for the workout quality, I don't feel like this video gets my heart rate up enough. If you are looking for a good workout that will really give you some visible results, this would not be my first choice."
4,"The ""Belly Twins"" are great!",The workout is difficult but fun. My 4 year old granddaughter enjoys working out with me.
3,Beginning Belly dance video,Bought the video to get me back into belly dancing and can't wait to relearn the basic moves to get me back into shape and dancing again!
2,"Not Content, Execution","My local library has the videos that this dvd is based on. I liked them so much that I decided to purchase the dvd. I was looking forward to continuing the program.The problem is not the program but the product itself. The dvd is not synchronized properly. The pictures stutter/halt making it difficult to align the voice over instructions with the images on the screen. Amazon was great about sending a replacement. Unfortunately, it did the same thing. I finally gave up."
1,boring,This dvd was extremely boring. Ater the 1st 10 min my 3 friends and I lost interest and just went 2 the gym.
5,SO GREAT!,"This video is so much fun! You really feel great during and after the work out. You don't feel like you're ""working out""! If you like dancing, you'll like this video! And Veena and Neena are so talented! Their belly dancing featurettes are really a nice bonus!"
3,not for everyone,"There is probably no need for yet another review, but I thought I'd add that I've been taking belly dance lessons for a year, so I knew how to do the things that the twins do not explain, but the basic recovery motion of bouncing back and forth between the more dance-like moves, which happens for a great deal of the video, hurt my feet! I have enjoyed the twins' three-CD instructions DVDs (they were recommended to me by my instructor), but this one isn't working for me. For the record, I'm in my 40's, and reasonably fit."
2,So boring,"This is no fun at all. It's slow, dull, and has no pretense of using any bellydance steps. It is just fairly traditional exercises set to bellydance music. A better alternative for isolating muscle groups is the Tamilee Webb ""I Want That"" series. If you want a dance workout, try the Island Girl series, which actually uses authentic dance moves that make the workout fun."
1,way too short!,"It's not a BAD dvd, however, it's so short I hardly think you'll make it through 2 weeks before being bored out of your mind."
1,Boring,"This video makes me wish I never got interested in this activity! It drags and drags... The moves are not explained we'll, and they move on too fast."
2,I think they should do more dance than they did.,"I wanted to do more dancing than just work-outs I would like to learn more of the dances, I know you need to work out too,but I know how to work-out and don't need so much of it! I just want to learn more of the belly dances."
3,Belldance Fitness for Beginners,I was expecting more excitement to the training. Overall its okay and will provide the moves that your are trying to learn for begginners.
2,Not worth it,"This DVD isn't worth the money or time you will waste buying when there are many out there that are much better.The description is very misleading. This is not a very good fitness DVD unless you have never worked out before or have been bed ridden for years. I had a stroke a few years ago & after doing for only a couple weeks, I found was not challenging at all.You have to fast forward through the twins talking and dancing between segments, which if they had taken those out & added more exercising in, might have made the DVD better.The other less annoying facts are that the choreography is disjointed & the narrative isn't inline with the moves."
2,not the best dance technique,"As a performing belly dancer, I do not care for these ladies. They are a bit hard to take seriously with their plastered smiles and over done moves. DO NOT get these videos to learn how to dance. The moves have been modified to be fitness oriented and not true to the dance. Their Sensual Art of Belly Dance videos are better, but there are MANY other amazing videos out there that are not quite so cutsie. Use these as a starting place to learn or check out your local Parks & Rec, Community College, or arts center for instructors in your area."
1,not much of a workout and doesn't involve much dancing,"If you are thinking of buying this expecting a dance workout, buy something else. There is not much actual dancing, just isolation of movement in parts of the body. I wouldn't mind the small amount of dancing if the workout was good, but it's not. There is little to no instruction and some of the exercises seem as if they could lead to some serious back injuries. I know I had some pain in my lower back after doing this workout and I hadn't even tried to do all of the exercises since some of them did not feel right to begin with."
1,defective dvd,"I was very disappointed to find that the dvd would not play in any of my dvd players...no matter what machine I used I received a ""disc loading"" error. I also purchased the 4-dvd set from the same collection and found that only 1 of the 4 dvds worked."
1,Do not buy this,"I got this and was very disappointed. The only thing they show you is how to move your arms. They say put some hip movement into it, but don't go into any explanation."
2,BORING,This dvd was very boring. There are not many belly dancing movements. If you are looking to learn to belly dance.... this is not the choice for you.
1,Don't get it,"This is more of a ""exercise"" dvdYou learn NO BELLYDANCING MOVES.I'm mad I paid $10 for it.I'm too lazy to return, but I did not like it."
2,Conventional Exercises to Bellydancing music,"Even though the back cover of the DVD claims the contrary, this is basically a DVD of conventional exercises to bellydancing music. The same goes for their fat-burning bellydancing workout. I am very diappointed. If I wanted to lay on the floor and do leg raises to bellydancing music, I could have put on a Hossam Ramzy CD and done so without spending 25 euros for a DVD!"
5,EXCELLENT,There is nothing bad to say about Neena and Veena DVD's. This works all areas of your body very easy to follow directions some parts of the exercise can difficult. The more you practice the easier it will become This DVD really make will your body really strong.I would say buy any Neena and Venna DVD's.
4,very easy,"This work out dvd is very easy to follow, it is very good work out for upper body (arms, stomach, chest). It does contain some work out for lower body but most of it is for the upper body. You will feel your arms burning (it is good) but you wont feel tired until after the work out, what is great."
5,Veena and Neena,These two are great. I have the 3 box set and this DVD. My abs are so sexy and now I have more moves than exlax. My husband is put into a trance everytime I dance and it is great exercise too. I had a ten pound baby and belly dancing helped me get back in shape.
3,Good if beginning to work out,"Although it is not the most spectacular DVD ever, its pretty good if you have a busy lifestyle, and need an easy work out to do in the morning or evening. I travel constantly for my job, and I needed something fairly simple to do if I can't make it to a real gym, or to complement hotel's lacking resources. Although I don't miss the annoying peppy chatter in ordinary exercise workouts, this one is kind of hokey because they don't talk at all, and there's this disembodied voice that randomly chimes in to instruct you, for no reason though.... The only thing that is annoying is they have all these dance sequences in the beginning of each exercise you have to fast forward through, which is cool and all--except you are trying to exercise, not watch a performance.All and all, I consider this a decent workout if you are starting a routine. Its different, and that makes it more interesting than, say , Denise Austin, who makes you want to hurl sometimes from her voice."
2,PLEASE DON'T!,"I ORDERED THIS DVD,THINKING THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD WORK OUT.NO SUCH THING,FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN SOMEONE WHO HAVE FLAT ABS,2nd.SOMEONE SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT MAYBE WE ALL CAN NOT WORKOUT AT THE SAME SPEED."
1,Ridiculous!,"I own this workout on DVD and it is completely ridiculous. It serves as a means for humor rather than one of fitness. It looks as if it was done on a very small budget as well. I do not recommend this to anyone, unless you are just looking for a good laugh."
5,Super workout,"I have a lot of fun by doing this exercises, it's easy but still efficient. I only can recommend it."
4,bellydance fitness for beginers,"Good dvd quality, big menu allows easy uncomplicated acess to work outs. for beginers looking to just work out and get moving this is a suitibel dvd for you. If you really want to get into the belly danceing concept i recomend you serch the web for tips on posture, and proper bodie placements to really do the moves corectly and get the maximem benifits.[and better looking abbs]"
2,Not that great,"I read the reviews and thought this would be a good video. Yes, a good workout, eventually, but very boring. There is so much ""lag"" time and only towards the end of each segment do you really begin to sweat. They also don't do a good job of teaching you how to do the moves. Wish I hadn't bought it!"
5,"Not a dance video, for muscle toning - my abs look great!","This DVD set isn't about dance instruction, it's about sculpting your body using the basic principles of belly dancing. If that's what you're looking for, you'll love this. I have gotten fantastic results - my body is taking on a whole new shape due to this workout. Not fast enough to count as a cardio rouitine, though if you're really giving it all you've got you will sweat! Another nice benefit of using this workout is that, over time, you'll get a real sense of muscle isolation and you will notice a difference in your posture. Highly recommeded - just add something else to your exercise regimen for cardio."
1,It [smelled],It said Woody Guthrie and Joseph Smith were going to hell. That's pretty good criteria for an awful book.
1,This is NOT a SATA RAID CONTROLLER CARD!,This item is NOT a PCI to SATA RAID controller card. It is a USB 2.0 controller. I just want to make that clear so that no one else wastes their time with this product.
2,A Foggy Story Set in the Fog,"This story centers around little owl who is lost, and proceeds to have page-after-page of dialogue with several animals of where home is.I got the feeling while reading this book to my children, that the author was a frustrated, unemployed poet, who was reduced to writing children's stories. It read as if the author was trying to emulate Margaret Wise Brown (Goodnight Moon), but falling far short of the mark.I'd say it's probably best for the 5-8 yrs audience, but I'm affraid they'll be bored. 3-4 yrs. won't get it. The story has moments of tranquility, but has more moments of confusion."
5,Great flashlight,Bought one of these at Walmart here in Mexico for about $8. Lots of power outages here in the summer and this comes in real handy. Works great as an emergency light/flashlight. My infant son is forever running the batteries dead on my other flashlights and I have found this to be something I use almost daily. Has a quality feel to it. Not Chinese junk although that is where it is made. Wish Walmart here would restock these but haven't been seen this product again.
4,LIGHT THE WAY IN DARKNESS,"These are a great device. You can plug them in and forget them, and you will until the electricity goes out - and these little gems come on automatically to light your way. The only issue I have is the ridiculous design. There is no way to position these things on a table so that they sit flat - which is a huge bummer for such a nifty light."
3,"Good content, lousy packaging.","Like the others in this series, the content is great. However, unlike those others, the cover is _very_ flimsy -- barely thicker than the pages it is supposed to protect. Call me silly, by I like my reference book covers to be sturdy. I received the Knitter's Companion at the same time, for the same price, and its cover is a nice, thick book board, that will stand up to the use it will receive."
2,It can't take the heat,"Well, I tried making ONE thing with this and it warped under the iron so badly that I can't use it again. Too bad."
2,LOW Budget and Sucked!,"What a piece of crap movie! Low budget, cheesy acting, looks like a film student filmed and wrote it. Prison inmates try to break out of prison and just all get killed at the end. Sucked."
3,Disappointed,I wasn't very happy the way the product was sent. It didn't have any directions or packaging. I was very disappointed.
2,Just not worth it.,I tryed to play this game but man is it boring. It just doesnt represent the PS2 and the power it has to offer. If I were you I would atleast rent before buying. That way you dont get burned.
1,Oh I wish I had my money back.,Bad UI. No control. Confusing. Terrible. Wish I had bought something else. You will too.
2,not quite there,This is the volume that tried to do too much. The author got the philosophy section right and presented Kant and Hegel. but Psychology ended up with nothing. And Neuroscience didn't even discuss the Hippocampus. Sorry; I'm glad I got an inexpensive used paperback. not recommended.
4,great book; helped explain much of episode 3,"this book helped explain a lot of the holes in the plot of episode 3. that is the only reason i read it. it explained some of the politics in a clear way, in a way that the movie could not do.it is necessary reading IF you want to understand how episode 3 transpired. i would recommened it to any star wars fan who cares about how things happened in rots."
4,Could Have Been a Movie in its Own Right,"This novel was a great lead-up to Episode III. In fact, it would have been great had George Lucas made this and Episode III as a two-part movie. The story was sound, the excitement and anticipation were there, and the transition between scenes (as well as to Episode III) was seamless.I particularly liked the hunt for the elusive Darth Sidious, which gave the story a touch of mystery. Another thing I liked was the airtime given to General Grievous, which was greater than the airtime given to him in Episode III and developed his character. Grievous was a star in this novel.4.5 Stars."
5,Entertaining use of Star Wars lingo and sound effects,If you want to know what happed between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith this is the book for you. I liked the plan of General Grievous kidnapping Palpatine.
2,Entertainment or propaganda?,"I got this book for light entertainment for a long plane ride. It served the purpose. The story has some interesting points and some back fill of information on some of the characters. There seemed to be some ground work laid for a story on the origins of Darth Sidious. Look for that series soon. One thing I really disliked was the insertion of innuendos--very, very thinly veiled innuendos--comparing Palpatine to Bush. Does Luceno think that some of his readers will be suaded to form their opinions of Bush and his policies based on this comparison? It was a completely egregious, needless distraction from the story. I hate being spoon fed propaganda of any kind in the guise of entertainment. But perhaps it was insisted upon by Lucas."
3,Good book but has contradictions!,Overall this was a good book and worth the time to read it. It does refer often to other Clone Wars events both novels and the animated series. However it does have have some major contradictions with volumue two of the Clone Wars cartoons which was supposes to be during the same time as this novel. In fact both were to end directly at the begining of ROTS. However this has Skywalker and Obi-wan in a totally differnt setting as the cartoons. You would like that Lucas Film and Books would try to avoid things like this. It is hard to know what the timeline is with such glaring differences in accounts.
2,nothing really special,"This book is alright if you're just looking to read more about the Star Wars universe but its nothing special.While it does give you some background on the characters such as General Greivous, its not really enough to justify the book. You can simply go to the Star Wars website and read about the ""expanded universe"" to learn more details.Some of the dialogue is questionable. Such as Anakin questioning Obi-wan about things that happened in Attack of the Clones...which is three years ago to them.Also, the political views of the author are imprinted in this book alot more blatently than need be. Star Wars never was and never will be a commentary about the US political system. He could have done a better job if he had left out US politics and focused more on a plotline.If you're looking to learn more about the Star Wars universe, buy a Star Wars encyclopedia or just search the internet; you'll get the information much faster."
3,Interesting but overlookable,"Labyrinth of Evil was the first Star Wars book I've read. It provides a good introduction to Episode III and interesting insights on General Grivious' character while explaining some questions left unanswered in Attack of the Clones.What I found undesirable about the book is James Luceno's excessively verbose and complicated writing style. I constantly feel like he's trying to impress readers with his vocabulary or knowledge of the Star Wars universe. Also, if you've never read previous Star Wars book, you may find it difficult to understand certain words or passages since it presumes knowledge from previous books.I'm sure diehard fans will love/need this book. But for casual Star Wars fans, you can sit this one out and still be able to enjoy the movie."
4,Palpatine at his abouslute best,"Ok I'm not going to wate time on a long review, others have gone into the book and I don't feel the issue is too complicated.Not too much happens in this, their aren't huge epic wars, or some grand event that shakes the galaxy. Instead this book is simply a deeper look at the New Republic jedi from the movie, the Obi Wai/Anakin team and how it works (both the good and bad of it, I actually got more of a feeling of camderdie here than I did in Episode 2 or the good cartoon), and most of all, Palpatine/Sidious machinations and scheming, how he thinks, how he manipulates and he carefully wields his intricate scheme.The book is divided into those 3, but Palpatine is the star of this book.If you want to see how a Magnifcent Bastard thinks and weaves his schemes, pick this book up. If you want some epic wars or politics, go read something else"
5,Read it in less than a day.,"I loved this book. I was skeptical because I've read some not-so-great Star Wars novels lately but this was one of the best I've come across. I particularly loved the dialogue and exchanges between Anakin and Obi-Wan. The last chapter, in particular, was so bittersweet.The novel is a great lead-in to Revenge of the Sith. I highly recommend it."
5,Luceno does it again,"This book reads just like Lucas directs his movies. I really like how it plays out the events just before ROTS and how ROTS picks up right after Labyrinth ends. It kept my attention the entire time. This is the first novel, since I read Treasure Island when I was 12, and now not the last, that I have read not required by professors for class. I have already seen ROTS twice and now I'm looking forward to reading in more detail what goes on. I highly recommend Labyrinth of Evil."
3,Labyrinth of Evil,"I didn't like this book. I thought it was well written, but I wanted to know what happened between Star Wars Episode II and III. This book was more about the 3 or 4 months before Episode III. It ends where Episode III picks up. There was a lot of detail about Count Dooku and an extremely long and detailed version of Chancellor Papatines capture. Anakin and Padme spend most of there time thinking about how much they miss each other. I wish I had skipped this one."
2,I don't get it,"I am only giving this 2 stars, however unfairly, since I havn't read the book. I thought Clone Wars Vol. 2 tied into Revenge Of The Sith. How does this tie in as well? If anybody can answer that, without giving away anything, I'd love to know before purchasing."
3,Cute toy but broke quick,The toy is really cool but one of the segments broke within 2 weeks of having it. I have 8 month babies and it is not like they were throwing this toy.
2,I don't get it...,"I know this toy has won a bunch of awards, though I don't get it. My son (7 months) didn't get it--examined it for a few seconds and threw it over his shoulder. Gave it to a friends 2 year old, she apparently didn't get it either and was quickly bored."
5,Favorite Toy - two times around,"Both of my children loved this ball. It's noisy but not too loud, colorful, has surprises (a face!), rolls, reflects... I wouldn't give it to an infant but from 3 to 12 months (or more) it's the one toy I wouldn't want to be without. It's my standard baby-shower gift now."
4,Good but not great,"Ball can roll, but only if an adult does it a certain way. My 7 mo old likes the toy, it catches his eye due to the mirrors while rolling and he teeths on it for a bit. Not much more exciting than that."
4,Great for sitting up babies!,My baby loved this toy from the moment we got it! She had just started sitting up and exploring and always took to this toy! It also entertain some of her older cousins for a while! She doesn't play with it as much now that she is crawling and exploring - but its such a great toy that its one I will keep for a while for other babies visiting!
4,Very cool!,"This toy is very cool and worth the price. It doesn't hold my son's attention like I wish it would, hence the four stars. Still a great buy!"
4,As advertised,"Do not assume this is an electronic toy. It isn't, and nothing in the description should lead you to believe otherwise. That said, our grandchild loves to hold it and make noise with it. She has gotten momentarily trapped with it around her wrist or finger, but that isn't due to a fault in the toy."
4,Good for teens!,Hummingbird is a short book of poetry and short stories from I believe to be the authors experiences throughout her life. Young people that have kids would benefit from Hummingbird if used as a guide to good life.
5,Review from the Publisher,"BEHIND THE LODGE DOOR. Paul A. Fisher. A probing analysis of Freemasonry in the U.S. in general, but especially relative to religious education, opposition to the Catholic Church, directing national social policy and how Masons attract members. Thoroughly documented. Immensly revealing. Covers the birth and rise of Freemasonry, the Catholic Church's early and traditional condemnation of it, its scope and influence, how in a real sense it is a religion of its own, etc. Essential to understanding the forces behind the scenes."
4,A Scathing Expose...,"Paul A. Fisher is obviously a Roman Catholic, who not only takes the Catholic stand on the matter of Freemasonry, but did some serious research on the subject of Masonry.Mr. Fisher also has taken a courageous stand by publishing what must be considered to be a very controversial book.I'm not a Roman Catholic, but it doesn't take being a Roman Catholic to read and heed the writing on the wall, and reach the conclusion that no committed Christian belongs behind the Lodge Door!""Behind the Lodge Door"" contains a goldmine of information for historians, patriots and Catholics and Non-Catholics who consider themselves Christians."
1,Don't Waste Your Money On This Fiction,"Pure fiction, and it isn't even very good. Just more of the same old hype of what goes on behind those ""secret"" doors of the lodge. All this being said about a fraternity that was the incubator of this wonderful country we currently enjoy. All this about the second biggest philanthropy on earth, the US government being the first. ( )"
1,Nothing new...,"Essentially a rehash of old anti-Masonic propaganda popular during the Church's reactionary years, but this time put into the context of the modern U.S. It's time for the traditionalists to find a new--and more worthy--opponent. Quite embarrassing."
3,"Some Good, Some Bad, Some ugly","David Schow certainly knows how to write, but this collection was just okay. The good stuff was Unhasped, Quebradora, Entr'acte, and Saturnalia. The bad was Watcher in the Sky, and the ugly was everything else - not bad, not good, just in between."
1,You dont need this tool,"READ THIS....I have a 2002 Suburban and I had to remove the quick-connect ""T"" hose fitting from the heater core. This tool didn't work at all for me. There just isn't enough room to get this tool around the heater core pipe. I gave up after 15 min. of trying. I finally found the trick using no tool...Dont just pinch the tabs on the hose fitting and pull. You need to pinch the tabs, then push the fitting forward towards the fireware (this removes the tension on the tabs against the pipe), then pull forward. It comes right off. The trick is getting the tension off the tabs first by pushing forward with the tabs depressed. Once to do it, you'll go ""wow that was easy"". The rear heater hose comes off the same way."
5,Tool worked as it should.,"Worked good after I figured out I was doing it wrong. Slide this tool over your heater core pipe, close it and slide it into the back of the fitting. Slowly twist and pull on the fitting and it will come off pretty easy. I was trying to pull the tool and fitting off together which will not work as the tool will hit on the lip of the pipe. Coat the rubber ""O"" ring of the new fitting with antifreeze before installing. Hint, if you have a 7/8"" fuel line disconnect, the plastic kind that will slip around the pipe, it will work too, just pull on the fitting itself when removing. Wish I would have figured this out before ordering.Thanks"
2,"No, this won't do","The Penguin Guide got it exactly right; on this disc Mehta manages to make the Berlin Philharmonic sound like any other second-rate orchestra. There is nothing really to savour here except for the most ardent Mehta enthusiast. Hamlet, for instance, is by many considered one of the best Liszt symphonic poems, but if you encountered it for the first time in this performance, you'll have a hard time figuring out why. Both that one and the other works sound utterly uninspired. Not only are the works consistently played too slowly, there is no sense of musical argument or structure - they all seem to move from one dull episode to another. A disappointment."
1,Utterly boring.......,"Mehta and the BPO - how could one go wrong?This is how: Surround one of the flashiest, most superficial of second-rate conductors (still around today) with the luxury and comfort of the plush upholstery possessed by the sumptuous Berlin Philharmonic and what happens? HE FALLS ASLEEP!A few minutes of the deadly dull tempi adopted by Mehta here should have been enough to propel the producer out of the studio to get a new battery for Mehta's pacemaker (if he has one).Could it be that the public's opinion of this dreadful musical mismatch is reflected by the absurdly low price asked for the used copies? (I sold my copy after only two hearings).If you want only the tone poems, I suppose Haitink, Noseda,or Masur are the safest recommendations.And if only the Hungarian Rhapsodies are wanted , Fischer and Dorati are the clearly the conductors to go for (and both with enthusiasm).As for Mehta, somebody do him a favor and wake him up."
2,I guess you may need to ski to appreciate these boots...,"These boots were the most uncomfortable I have ever tried. I bought a pair for myself and for my child. I was fortunate that the vendor was out of the Itasca Tahoe for my child and offered a replacement boot that turned out to be superb. So do judge this vendor by this specific boot, rather decide if you want a pair of boots that make you lean forward as if you are on skis."
2,It is spiced,Info provided doesn't disclose that this is spiced apple syrup. I wish someone in the US would make just plain apple syrup. I have to get it from Canada
4,Excellent freshman work,"After leaving the band Boulder in the early 80s, Stan set out on his own and this was the first issue of that venture. To the modern rock listener the production seems quite thin and this album could seriously use a remaster to bring up the bass. But for the time, 1983, it was still an outstanding effort.Most of the songs are solid AOR material. ""Loves Has Taken Me Away"" gets a bit redundant near the end, but a cover of Van Morrison's ""All American Boy"" is a guilty pleasure. ""Time Isn't Changing You"" was a surprise, as it's not your average ballad but is an older man referring either to his beautiful wife or his grown daughter.Overall it's a good sample of an artist's first venture on his own, an excellent example of classic AOR and a pleasant bit of nostalgia for the days when music required real talent."
5,Talk about a different plot!,"This is also the 'Wildest Story'! Very different from what I usually read. It is definitely what you would call a high-seas adventure. It had hurricane-force storms, pirates, headhunters, exotic islands, exotic love scenes, fun, a very odd entourage of characters; you name it had it! It was a romance novel, but that was not the main part of the story, & not what you would call a light read. I will have to say that it was very entertaining, & never let me get bored. Character development was excellent I thought. If you like high-seas adventure then I'm sure you'll like this one. If you want something different, this is it!"
4,A Wonderful Book...,"This is the first Lisa Cach book that I have read and I was very impressed with her writing style, characters, and plot. Lisa Cach cetainly knows how to weave a wonderful story and really bring it to life! The only reason I have taken 1 star away from my rating of this book is because this book just wasn't for me.In specific I didn't like the constant reference to ""The Hand of Destiny"", it got sickening. The red kingfisher that ""led"" Anne to the island and helped her companions find her when she was lost was just too unrealistic for me. And finally, I didn't like the setting either. I guess jungles and strange native peoples just aren't my thing for a romance novel.But I cannot say this was a bad book simply because of these things. This book just wasn't for me, but I can certainly see how this could be a wonderful book for those who would enjoy such a setting! Definately a book worth picking up if you think you'd enjoy it!"
2,Plot a little too far fetched,"I didn't really care for this book at all, the plot was a little too far fetched. I didn't like Anne at all, she was too vain, obsessed with being queen and just too full of herself for my liking.I liked Horatio the best but even his character could have had a little more depth to him.I only gave this book two stars for the Monkey. If you still want to read this book, I would suggest the library."
3,A dreary non-suspensefull history lesson!,"I love Barbara Parker and can't wait for each book, so I was really disappointed to have purchased a Cuban history book instead of a legal thriller. I understand that the writer is passionate about Cuba and Cuban exiles, but this story was so perdictable and dull, she lost my sympathy early on. My guess is that anybody acting against Fidal Castro while in Cuba will always be in danger, so the unfolding events were no surprise.Hopefully the next book will have both a legal case and Gail's family life or I'm thinking Parker's books go off my ""must buy in hardcover"" list."
2,Pure gibberish,"I bought this book because in the cover was written ""money back guaranteed"" of course I don't want my money back just because I read the book, and if you read a book you don't deserve your money back no matter if you liked it or not.The main plot is so boring even if you can find it, but it's a difficult task to find it, and the end is the biggest fairy tale I ever read. In the other hand, as all Cuban's plot books, if you want to go to Cuba read this book instead of going to a travel agency.I'll say to the publishes that don't be so sure about what they are guarantying. Don't waste your time and money in this one."
3,Tense and Frenetic!,"This latest in Ms Parker's books is her tribute to her Cuban sympathies. Anthony and Gail take his and her children and her mother for a visit to Anthony's Cuban father and sister. Interesting tidbits here and there. Cuba is on the verge of change; Fidel Castro is almost 80. It will be interesting.The story was, as usual. one tense moment after another. Anthony and Gail are typical lawyers: She has to know every little detail and he lies like a rug!!!!I think Ms Parker caught the Latin emotions (and they are volatile) well. It's hard to put the book down. But I am hoping her next ""Suspicion of......"" will take place back home."
4,"Not like the others, but very good!","If you are expecting a Gail Connor, Anthony Quintana novel with legal twists and courtroom scenes, you are not going to find it in this book. Very much unlike the entire ""Suspician of"" series this is merely an adventure in Cuba and a bit of a travelogue that helped me to understand 21st century Cuba a lot better. I really enjoyed it and found the tension and suspense to be very good, while understanding the ambivalence of the Cuban people a lot better. I listened in Unabridged Audio. I really liked the time when Barbara Rosenblatt was reading the series - in this one (William Dufris) many of the spanish accents sounded alike and I did have a bit of trouble differenciating characters. All in all I really liked the book, as I will also enjoy a return to Miami."
5,Loving this CD,I remember Paul Davis from my senior year in high school my boyfriend and i listened to the Singer of Songs Teller of Tales on 8-track non stop for months. I am waiting for it to come out on CD
2,Not so good,"What a disappointment. Not his best songs!I wish I had bought the original 1981 album or the Greatest Hits I originally ordered. He has the sweetest voice but this compilation is a disappointing cd, By the way I miss records and albums and the sound quality. Have five more cd's coming from Amazon. I hope they are not this disappointing."
4,Good collection but lacking in one place,"I do like this album but I am dissapointed that it lacks ""Cool Night"" and perhaps ""65 Love Affair"". Both I believe were hits when released although ""65 Love Affair"" was less so."
3,"Great, but missing a great tune.","Unfortunately, a song that I remember from my vinyl days, ""Too Slow to Disco"" didn't make it onto this album. It was a funny tune, dated by today's standards, but still well worth hearing. Hey, Sony Records! A little re-release or two, please?"
3,"Good stuff, but not ""Cool Night"" caliber","These are generally good songs, but like a few people have said here, ""Cool Night"" is THE album. For those who don't know, ""Cool Night"" is available in the states. I bought it somewhere else online about 2 years ago. Do a few web searches and I'll bet you'll find it. For example, try a web search for ""What You Got To Say About Love"" and you might get lucky. Anyway, ""Cool Night"" is a 5 star album, and where is Paul? I understand he was shot in the stomach in the mid 80s, he's OK now, wrote a couple of #1 country hits for other artists (""Meet Me In Montana"" for one), but where is he now?"
3,"They forgot beautiful songs, like""cool night or '65 love aff","The CD is great but I think, as it has been released in 1995, that that could have made a double CD, including songs like ""COOL NIGHT"" or '65 love affair"" which are very beautiful songs, and as to to me, ""Cool Night"" is one of the most beautiful song of ever. Unfortunatly, it does not seem to be available on the matket !"
3,Very Sentimental Collection With a HUGE Hole In It . . . . .,"My wife goes crazy for anything Paul Davis. He just knew how to set a mood back when the mellow 70s were giving way to the techie 80s.BUT - My FAVORITE PD song is NOT on here: ""65 Love Affair""!HOW can you compile a best of Paul Davis and not have that song on here??? Actually, I'm that way with most musicians: My favorite song by any musician is usually their least popular song in general - go figure!RIP Paul - your mellowness and sheer love of song will live on as long as people continue listening to music."
1,Would NOT recommend this seller,"I purchased the book last semester and it seemed fine, so I wrote a great review. This semester comes along and just about every page that I need for an assignment is missing. Not satisfied at all. Make sure you check the book upon receiving for missing pages, something I should have done. Hope this helps!"
4,Arrived as expected,"The book arrived before my son started class and it was in the condition as described. The first sentence is really enough of a review but since I'm required to use 20 non-repeated words, the experience was ok."
1,Am I the only one not drinking the punch?,"This is poorly done in every way (except the opening credits). Quirky, which I like but flat, dull, and lame! Couldn't wait for it to end. Pointless flick."
1,I'm sorry but this is terrible!,"Everything that was bad about the '80s (synthesizers, drum machines, overproduction) is in glorious, excessive full display in this recording. The Hollies are/were a great band. But this album doesn't enrich their legacy. Most of the songs are so maudlin they could have been written for the contestants of 'American Idol'. I own most of the Hollies catalogue up to the mid-70s but this does not belong with it. I keep revisiting this hoping that I will 'warm' to it but I can't. This pales beside anything they did. Put this on and then put on the great comp CD 'All the Hits and More' or the 70's albums 'Distant Light', 'Romany' or 'Hollies'. There is no comparison. This one's going back to the used CD bin."
1,Worst I have seen in a while,"Movies like this give the genre a bad name.A very thin story about 3 kids who get mixed up in devil worshipping when they end up at the wrong type of party. The party is a bad excuse to show some nudity. The actings is horrible, but I guess that's understandable when you have to portrait characters who are thinner than the copper in the latest AMD or Intel processors.My advice: go watch something else."
1,Fast forward review,"Any film where the opening credits are over a nearly naked bound girl being threatened with a knife by a satan worhsipper wearing a Michael Jackson mask has to be of interest to a sex sleaze fan, don't you think? The girl gets a little bloody and loses her top to MJ, and then there's a bunch of plot before we get to a couple more girls being prepared for sacrifice or something, but nothing really happens, because as usual the girls get rescued.From a sleaze standpoint maybe one star for the opening scene, but there's really not much here at all. There's lots of satanist films, and scores of starlets that get tied to altars, but hardly ever does anything really happen to them due to the pitiful security measures of the robed devil worshippers. Maybe you could start a security company catering to them and we could actually get some girl torturing going on . . . Acme Security guarantees no interruptions to your unholy rites!"
3,"Good Start, bad finish","As other people have stated, this movie starts off pretty good. I like the concept behind the film and even though the acting was great (which doesn't bother me)this movie accomplished the one thing I watched it for...entertainment. The movie itself was going pretty good until the whole chase in the woods ended and the next morning they entered the small town of Howard's Point. The town wasn't very convincing. A high point to the movie was the Rave Scene, and toward the end of the movie there is a scene where Samantha is being tortured. Elena Lyons played the best character (Fawn, she makes a nice villain! I think there should have been a little more to satanic cult than what was shown. In conclusion, the movie lacked in several areas but overall it was entertaining."
1,0 STARS: A laughing stock!!!,"In ""Devil's Prey"", we have the most unconvincing looking punk Mama's boy satanists the world has ever seen, and they are out to sacrifice the stupid teenaged drug using partiers that come near their unsuspecting lair. A very boring, pathetic and unconvincing cat and mouse game ensues and languishes on until its flushing of the toilet bowl conclusion. I simply could not stop laughing at these dorks. One is not likely to run into this many wusses in one place anywhere else in the world except in this movie.There are no likeable characters, the script is stupid, the acting is awful, and the execution of the plot was pathetic. Need I go on? In short, this movie is a travesty and should never have been put to film. I laughed until I fell asleep. Thank God I caught it on fearnet and did not pay for it. I like movies about the horrors of satanism as much as the rest of red-blooded horror movie fans out there, but heed my warning and stay away from this garbage. It is a JOKE!"
2,"entertaining, but slow","this movie is ok, a 2.5/5 rating. there's enough other reviews to provide a plot overview. however, i have 2 complaints. first, in the beginning several people in robes and masks chase some people, including a few somewhat big guys. the chasers are each unarmed, but yet everyone runs in absolute terror from them. hmm. second, its slow. the opening scenes are pretty well done, but then it slows down and becomes just not very interesting. its an ok rental if you're bored and into late 1990s horror types (which i am), but just don't expect something all that impressive."
5,Are you using your microwave only to heat water?,What a loss !!!Try this recipes and you will never COOK IN THE STOVE AGAIN!They are simply delicious and easy...And Fast !
2,some what satisfied,"we where led to believe that they where hand cut stained glass, not the kind that it is led you to believe, but looks good over the sink, it looks like a good plastic imitation to me. Call and ask questions first, we did not."
2,Diamonds my A$$.,"Cry of love's first album ""Brother"" was a masterpeice. This album blows ! I've never been more more dissapointed in a second album from a band ever !"
3,Not what I was expecting,"I ordered this book thinking that this would help me understand ""The World's Religion"". Though this book is only questions about the text and doesn't help clarify the complicated reading in ""The World's Religion"". This workbook still can be useful if you use the questions to keep you focused and to help you remember all that is being said. But if you are a college student who is in a panic because she has to write essays about the book that she can't comprehend and hopes this will be a quick fix, well think again because this workbook still requires you to read the book and understand it."
3,Amazon delivered on a timely manner.,"The book is a requirement for class, so I got it because I need it.I have no comments either way."
1,No caffeine boost,"I started drinking this tea as an alternative to coffee, and I notice no caffeine boost affects whatsoever. A waste of money."
4,Excellent compilations of excerpts from writings of war.,As a person with a graduate degree in 20th. century history and having read countless books on the subject this book gave an uncomparable insight into the perceptions of the people who lived through these horrors. Apart from that most of the writing is of great quality and highly enjoyable as far as this dark side of human society can be. I recommend this book for everyone who has any interest in history and the wars that shaped the 20th century.
2,What about property rights under assult RIGHT NOW!,"I am concerned about the many, many citizens in our country that are losing their property AS WE SPEAK under the so- called eminent domain right, and I am more concerned about that right now than any ""threat"" of losing rights under Ashcroft. What is being done right now for those who have lost their homes already to county commissioners who force property owners to sell their homes and property so someone with more money can build bigger homes for more tax revenue?! Or businesses like the New York Times forcing homeowners out of their property to build a new building! Let's focus on what's going on in the real world right now!"
1,Disappointing,"Seriously, how did this book get published? It features some b&w pictures of textures, and I bought it because in the review it said that all artists need this book. I have the ability to find artistic inspiration in a variety of images where other people don't see anything inspiring. However, I am not excited or inspired by this book at all. My main complaints: not enough examples, some color pictures would enhance the offering, really random choice of textures. Please don't waste your money, if you're looking for some inspiring close up's of forms or textures here's some of my favorites: ""One Hundred Seashells"" by Harold Feinstein, ""Geometric Patterns"" by the Peplin Press, ""Fashion in Colors"" by the Cooper Hewitt,""Searchings: Secret Landscapes of Flowers, Volume II"" by Barbara Bordnick, ""Earth from Above, Third Edition"" by Yann Arthus-Bertrand, ""Super Vision: A New View of Nature"" by Ivan Amato, ""Andy Goldsworthy: A Collaboration with Nature (Hardcover)"" by Andy Goldsworthy."
4,"Big pills, but big dosage","I bought these for the EPA and DHA content. Most fish oil pills have very small amounts and I would need five, six or even nine pills a day for the dosage recommended by my doctor. These only require three a day and, though they are more expensive than other fish oil pills, they actually saved me money over other smaller and cheaper pills, because I don't have to take as many. Less hassle too, though they may be tough for people who can't swallow large capsules."
4,Aiwa CADW535 Carry Component System CD with Digital Tuner,"The sound is very good for the size of the speakers, but not as good as a Bose radio we have. The major fault I find is with the radio reception. It does not pick up the more distant signals that our Bose radio easily picks up. The CD and Tape mechanisms seem to function well, but only time will tell regarding long-term reliability. The 3-mode equalizer is limited to Rock (high and low frequency ranges), Pop (voice and mid-range frequencies), and Jazz (emphasis on the low range frequencies). Overall, this unit is an adequate sound system for those not demanding the highest sound quality and not requiring static-free reception of the weaker AM and FM radio signals."
1,HOLDING BACK CUSS WORDS: Don't risk it!,I am a physician and used this device to back up some electronic patient charts: Yesterday it worked fine -- today it does nothing -- all from sitting on my desk over night!I wish I had seen these reviews before wasting my money.
1,Don't purchase it!,"I bought this item for $80 from Fry's via its Internet store (www.outpost.com). It is the worst memory stick that I have ever had! With large files (over 50M), the stick locks up and files cannot be opened. Save your money!"
1,Beware buyers,"Emprex Micro Storage 2.2 GB USB 2.0 Portable Micro Hard Drive.I would not buy this product, please beware.I bought this device for storage; I had it for five days. I never put more then 1gig on it at one time. The fifth day it started to give errors, then turn off. I would reset it and the light would flash on for a few seconds then die. Took me one hour to get my work off the device.I was able to return it for a full refund. I will stick with Flash memory storage for now on."
1,"Pure garbage, avoid this at all costs","If Amazon had an option for zero stars, I'd have picked that instead.Purchased this from a Fry's retailer several months ago. Like every other review here, the drive worked fine for maybe a month, then started exibiting clicking noises and excessive delays when opening files. Finally it stopped working altogether.Stick with flash-based memory devices. I put my USB flash drive through a full wash and dry cycle by mistake and it came out working just fine afterwards. The Emprex drive will crash if you breathe on it too hard."
1,DONT DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the worst usb drive ever...mine worked for exactly 4hrs before it stoped...it dosent just stop though...it is a slow painfull death teasing you with the hope of recovering the data that is on it. I wouldnt use this to store spam.
1,Poor Quality,"Was thrilled to get a 2.2 Gig portable storage device for only $80. Not so thrilled when I lost 3 days of research work!!! Transfered data to the Emprex drive while at work, verified the files after transfer and all was fine. By the time I got home & tried to upload to home PC the device heated up and would no longer function. Thought it was a driver problem but further testing revealed the Emprex was now D.O.A.I traded it in on some SD RAM for my new Palm Treo unit.This device should come with a warning lable:""The techie general has determined that use of this product is hazardous to your data ~ Use at your own RISK!!!"""
1,Worst USB drive in the market,"I bought this for 80 $ and its waste of money. Its doesnt work at all.It worked for a day or so and then it stopped working. Not only I lost my money and time, I also lots my valuable information stored on it.Dont buy it."
1,Avoid Emprex micro hard drives.,"As many of the previous reviewers said, I also bought this at Fry's last year. My hard drive worked for several months, but I didn't expect to fail the way it did. Like some people, I did lose the data that was on it since I didn't back up. Wish I had.But there were warning signs that I see now in hindsight.The hard drive does not come with a warranty. NO WARRANTY!I was lucky to get the money I spend on it, but don't count on this happening if you buy this device.It is not a 'flash' USB drive. Since it has mechanical parts, it is more prone to fail.It ended up with the hard drive not being recognized by Windows.Always try to check reviews of something you are buying and if it has a warranty."
4,Classic Series,Bought this for my daughter. The packaging quality seems a little cheap with old and faded pictures on the cover. But the disc seems fine and my daughter is happy to own the series on DVD instead of old VHS tapes.
3,I love the Wilderness and Nature in this Film,"The movie is filled with scenes of wild animals and nature! These are what make the movie worthwhile to watch. I love the outside so this movie can bring that to you if you have been in the house or worked and haven't had the opportunity to surround yourself with nature. I would love to British Columbia and the Uinta Mountains of Utah where this was filmed. The story line is kind of plain and simple. A bank robber who is a professional gambler is on the run. He finds two kids alone trying to make it to Oregon and hooks up with them after many trys to win them over. It is a good kids film! If you like Little House on the Praire, it has similarities. Another movie like this could be The Wilderness Family.Lisa Nary"
3,"I remember this one, too.","And I have very fond memories of it. Good clean family fun; if that still has any validity these days anymore.Oh, and Movie Gal, it was released in 1976."
5,"Good, clean family movie!","This movie is a very family-friendly film. My 2-yr-old is fascinated with all the animals in it and my older kids enjoy the scenery. Makes family movie time enjoyable, not having to worry about what the kids are watching or what they might see!"
5,Dreamy Folk with Poetic Lyrics,"Imagine someone playing a piano on an empty stage in the middle of cave and you have the initial concept of Sparrow that quickly turns into a haunted windswept land. Guitar follows with organic sounds morphing with dreamy psychedelic vocals.The piano appears again in ""Lilacglass"" and quickly melts away, providing a certain clarity between the vocal haze and then the music turns breathlessly beautiful in Violet which I found to be interesting on the emotional level and this album delves into emotional complexity, revealing beauty in love and loss.Jes Lenee's voice wanders through dreamy worlds of piano, violin and folk-inspired guitar. Through a merging of modalities, she creates a completely unique sound that sounds hauntingly familiar to the heart. The album ends as it begins and the way this album is arranged shows an advanced sense of artistic excellence.~The Rebecca Review"
3,"Not bad, not great","OK, I'm standing in the middle of the last two reviews. Starting with the bad thing; The CD is very incomplete, you're gonna have to be creative with the exercices. But if you know your blues, there's a chance your going to figure it out. There are a lot of songs in the book from different blues artists that are not on the CD. You're gonna have to find them(buying or sharing). I like the book because, being an experience player(not professional),it contains very good stuff. You're going to find something interesting for sure. Not for beginner!"
2,This book is [not good],"The author obviously loves the blues and knows all there is to know, unfortunetly the CD that comes with the book jumps all over the place and doesn't help at all. None of the transcriptions are recorded. The exercises aren't executed clearly. This is a good book if you read music. If you don't your [out of luck]. Blues is an oral tradition, you'd think a little more time would have been spent recording and playing the examples."
2,The Book is Great!!! The CD Sucks!!!!,"The book is full of all the great info you would want if you want to learn or get better at slide guitar. The one problem is the CD. There are only 10 tracks that cover probably 15% of the material. Not to mention, the CD is unorganized and the tracks aren't mentioned by the exercises. If your like me and need the CD to learn the songs, you won't want to buy this book. If you can read music and figure out time signatures, there is allot of great info in the Book. 2 stars for the book!! NILL for the CD"
5,Goosebumps Theme = BRILLIANT,"Like most kids of the 90s I LOVED Goosebumps! But aside from the books, this tv show has a really great spooky theme song! It's HOT! I bought the CD just for that, but was surprised to find the eerie music afterwards was pretty good too. I definately recommend this for your Halloween music collection."
1,bags were ugly...sorry!,I thought the bags in this book were hideous. Not 1 thing I would even consider making. Just not what I had hoped for.
1,26 Boring Pouches to Knit,"Because this book is authored by a ""Rowan consultant"", I thought it was safe to buy sight unseen. Wrong, wrong, wrong!The book contains ""patterns"" for 26 bags consisting of two squares or rectangles sewn together. Mostly the patterns call for stripes, although some use bobbles, cables, sequins, beads, intarsia hearts, knitted flowers, or embroidered flowers as variations. The yarn color selections for the pouches are generally poor, and even the addition of metallic Rowan lurex yarn fails to add pizzazz.Accompanying ""how-to"" material is pretty much unrelated to specific problems of knitted bags. For example, there appears to be nothing about linings.If you want to knit bags, a much better selection would be PURSENALITIES by Eva Weichmann. Weichmann's book has patterns for handbags of varying shapes and sizes, including some that are felted."
1,Sorry! Not something anybody needs.,"This one is going back to Amazon. If you can knit a patch, bind it, fold it in half, sew the sides together, and attach a handle, you don't need this book. That is the gist of almost every pattern. There is some beadwork in it also, but I can tell you how to do that right now for free. String the beads onto the yarn first, then knit. Push them forward, out of your way, as you go. When it's time to put one in, pull it into place. I think this book didn't need to be made. Certainly, it's not reflective of what this designer can do. I'm still in the market for a bags book."
2,Not great,I have to agree with the other reviewers and say that this book was a big disappointment. While there are a couple of bags that are very cute most aren't all that original. While it is called 25 Bags to Knit and there are probably 25 bags in the book a few of them looked identical to me but in different colors. I did like how it was spiral bound to lay flat and some of the knitting tutorials were good (with good photos) but I wasn't all that inspired really by the bags themselves.
1,Garter stitch bag over and over and over,Not much else to say about it other than that. Oh but wait we fresh it up with some different yarns. Seriously are you going to spend $100 on yarn to make one boring bag? They are pretty... pretty simple. Don't waste your money.
5,Help!,"I have this album on vinyl, and have always loved it, but despite searching the world, I have been unable to obtain the CD(I missed out when it was re-released). Can anybody help PLEASE! The extra tracks on the CD sound great (from the samples on Amazon) so any help in me obtaining it (within my limited budget - 15 max) would be very much appreciated."
5,"""Honalu"" alone is worth the price od this treasure....","Holly Beth Vincent's solo effort suffers from poor production and muddy, bad ""wall of sound"" attempts to ape Phil Spector.Ignore these problems.Like Big Star's ""Third"" this album is a forgotten treasure of pop rock, and the opening track ""Honalu"" is perhaps the most overlooked unreleased single of its decade.No one I've ever played this record for has ever been anything but less than blown away, and the immediately go and buy it for themselves (no, I don't `rip' things for people, even friends...artists need your financial support)."
5,Great Product,This product is exactly as described. Shipped in a timely manner. Would definitely recommend. Thank you!
5,Just what I was looking for!,This really is great--I felt wonderful after completing the stretches. It's MUCH better than the Ann Smith series.
2,Skip,I think I must have purchased a bad copy. The DVD kept skipping to the end of the DVD. It was a great workout when it wasn't skipping. I am going to have to return it for another one
2,Doesn't work,"The last part - total stretch for flexibility - stops working about 2 minutes in. The individual stretch sections work fine though. Still, I'm out the cohesive stretch, which is no good..."
4,Best Streching Video for Beginners,"I am 60 years old and never engaged in any formal streching program, but I thought I would give this a try. It has been a terrific program making me feel wonderful when I am done and full of energy to face the day. The 10 minute segments allow me to do a whole routine or just part of the routine while still getting benefit. If you have never tried a streching program, this is a great way to get started for a very reasonable price."
4,Good basic stretching,"This is a basic stretch, but thorough. Her guidance is great, and the combo of the workouts is nice. I swim, and the chest stretches are great--I feel better after just doing the stretches once!I wish it had more advanced versions of the stretches, but I have room for improvement with the stretches as presented. A great starter stretch workout."
3,Stretches are too brief,"This was decent, but not great. I did learn some new stretches. And I like how it's broken down into three segments. Doing the stretches standing, sitting, and on the floor made it more interesting.But she holds each stretch for only five to eight seconds, and that's not long enough."
5,total stretch,"I love Tamilee! she is very clear and precise, she explains everything she is telling you to do, and she has such a mellow, friendly way about her. These stretching routines really do the trick!"
5,Great Stretch DVD,I really enjoy this stretch video. It does exactly what it says it will do. I am excited to try it more often. I love the stretch and relaxation part. Its great to help me unwind at the end of a long day.
4,YOU CAN DO IT!,guess what! im not flexible AT ALL but i was able to do the whole stretch for flexibility part of this dvd! and i didnt get bored either! soo amazing...im going to keep doing it (only done it like 3 times so far) to see if it actually helps to me get more flexible. but try it out if you usually have problems stretching and need something for after your workouts.
5,Excellent stretching,"This DVD comes in 3 segments: Standing, Sitting, and Floor. I love to do all three when I have the time. If not, I will do just one and I still feel revived and limber. I highly recommend this dvd."
5,Total relaxation!!!,"I really like Tamilee, not only because she's a pro at this but because she doesn't annoy me like other instructors. This DVD is really relaxing and helps you stretch so that you feel energized. I love that it's broken down into a 30 min stretch for flexibility and three 10 min stretches for when you're short on time. In all this an effective stretch video that is not complicated and will improve your workouts."
5,"try it, you'll like it","I have had trouble with a hip for years. We do this several times a week and it has helped my hip problem. It is very clear, easy to do and stretches muscles you didn't know you had. Our group includes several ladies in their 90's and we have all found it helpful."
4,Great stretches,"Only negative so far is that I wish the stretches would each last a little longer. Otherwise, it's thorough, not too difficult, and Tamilee is very informative, serene, and motivating. Highly recommend!"
3,Great (but has some glitches),"The DVD was exactly what i was looking for, quick stretching targeting all of the body but it could use some more neck stretches. The DVD has trouble loading correctly, very annoying, but once it works I love it."
1,Sorely Disappointment,"I was disappointed in this product. The title of the DVD is Total Stretch for ""Beginners"". I was expecting something very simple, not too complicated, and I was sorely disappointed...pun intended. She stretched me in ways that a human is not meant to be stretched...unless of course you are a size 0 and can bend yourself into a human pretzel. I am by no stretch of the imagination a size 0, so I found the stretches to be difficult and extremely awkward. I also bought this DVD because in the description it said that it had a relaxation technique session. Well the session lasted for about 5 minutes, and it was not differentiated on the DVD menu from the stretching exercises. I had to jump around on the DVD for about 15 minutes before I finally found it. I would not recommend this product for someone who is looking for a ""beginners"" stretching video. Keep looking."
5,Everyone should own this video!,"I love the Beginner's stretch portion of this video. It is broken into 10 minute increments - great if you are short on time. There is a sitting, standing, and lying program, each 10 minutes. You can do 1, 2 or all 3. It really relaxes as well as energizes. Simple to do. Highly recommend for everyone."
4,Good stretching,"I like this video, it gets to the point, it teaches bacis stretches you can learn and do without the DVD.Buy it!"
5,Great DVD!,"I've been doing this DVD for a few weeks now and can really tell a difference in the stiffness from which I was suffering. This DVD is very versatile in that she has a 30 minute flexibility stretch as well as three separate 10 minutes stretches: one done while sitting, one standing and one on the floor. So you can mix and match whatever variations you like according to your time availability or preferred stretching program. I try to do at least one 10 minute stretch several days a week and a 30 minute stretch a couple times a week and it has really helped. I'm sleeping better, too, as I was experiencing aches and pains in my hip but that has subsided quite a bit and I'm more relaxed and flexible in general. I've heard stretching is so good for your body as you get older (well, at any age!) and I highly recommend this program. Ms. Webb is very relaxing, pleasant and gentle in her presentation and makes you feel comfortable at your level."
3,Good Lab Manual,"I used this in high school for DC circuits, it was certainly adequate for the purpose. Be aware that this lab book is specifically geared to the Philco Ford trainer unit. Without that old boat anchor, you will need to come up with your own components, DC supply, and breadboard."
1,"I'd give it a ""ZERO STARS"" if I could","I used one tube of the Cutter Flea & Tick for dogs over 66 lbs. on my 98 lb. Rottweiler on Saturday. By Saturday night, she was scratching like crazy, and couldn't walk for more than 5 or 6 steps before her hind leg would come up to start scratching again. We bathed her first thing Sunday morning, and scrubbed the best we could. It is now Wednesday, and the poor thing is still itchy. She's been on 25 mg of Benadryl 2x a day, which seems to help, but as soon as it wears off, she's scratching again. As you can imagine, we have not had a full night of sleep since this started. The vet can't see us until Friday, and I feel like an awful person for putting my poor dog through this!"
1,flee product,"this product doesn't work. save your money, and go elsewhere. by frontline. you get what you pay for. your dogs needs something that works."
1,Itchy dogs.,Over a weeklong period I found this made my two dogs itch more. Had to scrub them down and put Frontline on them.
4,No Fleas,This product was well tolerated by my dog.The best thing about this product besides the ease of use was the price and the speed of delivery.
3,Cheap but not very effective,"We have two dogs, both 11 months old. I have been using this for a few months now. This seems to irritate their skin and while one seems to hide it since he is completely scared of getting the application, my other dog (a black lab mix) goes crazy after getting this applied on her skin. She runs around and rolls on the ground, trying to get rid of the application. It really doesn't help when she pretty much rubs most of it off. However, I haven't seen any fleas or ticks on them. Still, the initial application seems to be extremely irritating and I had not seen this with Frontline. She then proceeds to ignore me for the whole day for doing this to her. And they still both scratch... a lot.I was hoping they'd get used to this but it seems like it's just too harsh for my dogs."
2,Cd''s,I did not have good luck with them. About three of them would not play. I even bought a new player and they still would not play. You even replaced some of them but had the same results. I would like the new one but am afraid to buy it and have same problem
4,Reunion of the Gaither Vocal Band,I enjoyed meeting some of the former members of the Gaither vocal band and hearing their contributions to this group of talented musicians.
4,Glorious,"Nadja does heavy and does it well. Absent are fruity vocals or power riffs and chinas boring holes into your ears. Ambient Doom Metal, they call it. Whatever, it's good and heavy."
1,worthless,doesn't have self power and so the PS2 mouse doesn't reactivate when you switch back to the computer.
5,Great CD With Bonus Track,"This is a great CD from the Bongos. If you're a hard-core fan looking for bonus tracks be aware that the import (on the Line label, 1991) only has 15 tracks, not 16 as Amazon has listed. ""Nuts And Bolts"" is on this version, the 1992 U.S. CD, but not on the import. Razor & Tie does their usual superb job with this reissue, including excellent sound and an 8-page booklet with lyrics and photos."
1,DAMAGED GOODS,THE GUITAR WAS VERY NICE LOOKING AND WE WERE PLEASE TO SEE IT. HOWEVER WHEN WE GAVE IT AS A GIFT WE FOUND OUT THAT THE NECK OF THE GUITAR WAS WARPED AND UNPLAYABLE WE RETURNED IT TO AMAZON FOR A REFUND.
5,Over Do Birthday gifts,"I purched two of this kind of guitar sets one red one, and one blue one, one for each of my two sons."
2,Flimsy,"The sound of these was a bit bright, but listenable. They were comfortable. I am using past tense here because the wires were so flimsy that the phones were useless within a month after I bought them. The first tear on the main wire I was able to repair with electric tape (ugly, but it worked). The second tear, closer to the right earbud, was unrepairable and so I had to replace them. Not worth the money until JVC improves the quality of the wires."
5,Guitarist Supreme,"Con La Lluvia is a release by one supreme guitarist.From start to finish the entire release holds your attention. There are a variety of musical styles displayed which only adds to the overall sound of this project. Sergio Lara is one heck of a guitarist, in fact I would dare to call him ""Guitarist Supreme""If you Love guitar music you'll Love Sergio Lara. I for one am Very happy I own a copy."
1,Stinko,"If you REALLY like Queen ... stay away from this album. Remix from Hell ... that should be the title. GAWD, I am SO disappointed. Wish I had read the revues FIRST!"
1,Check out the fine print,"Oops. This is ""ruined by Rick Rubin"". This is a remix version. If you want the original un-retouched version of the Queen songs don't buy this."
2,Worst remixes I've ever heard,"Queen is a great band. ""We Will Rock You"" and ""We are the Champions"" are great songs. The original versions are anyway. I bought this in a bargain bin at a CD store for a couple bucks. I've never been a big fan of the ""bonus"" remixes on the Hollywood Queen remasters, but as a completist, I decided to get this disc.Yuck. Tracks two through five are awful, and except for track three, you'd never know these are popular Queen songs. I would give this waste of plastic only one star, but I do enjoy the end of track one, which extends Brian May's guitar solo. However, this is the same remix on the News of the World CD, so you can get it there, along with 11 fantastic songs, including the original (and superior) versions of ""We Will Rock You"" and ""We Are the Champions."""
1,Take it from a huge Queen fan: Don't waste your money.,"If you don't really like Queen's music, and really like bad rap, this may be the disc for you."
4,sure its overplayed but it still rocks!,"i know it seems like enough is enough but this ones a classic. if you havent heard it you ought to buy it, i like it and im sure you will too!"
3,Worth it for one 5 second segment....,"I pretty much agree with all that's gone before, but the section when the drums kick in to Brian May's guitar solo is great! Should have been on the original! Gets a bit naff 5 seconds later when the backwards guitar comes in..... As for ""We are the Champions"", what an awful mix - surely an afterthought! By the way fact fans, there exists a promo version with 3 more mixes of WWRY! Can we contain our excitement?!"
2,shorter life than my old one,"""the battery has the original seal & packaging.but it stays for less time than my old battery that i was replacing in the first place.i'm really thinking of putting my old battery back"""
2,Nikia 7610 battery,"Advertise shows this product in a seal retail package. However, the deliveried item was not. It was in a small folding plastic bag."
4,A good cake pan,This turned out pretty cute. The indentions did not indent too much where the balls of the crown are but it still turned out cute! I just used the picture as my guide.
5,Had This Stereo Since 2001 and still going strong!,"I have had this stereo since 2001 and it's still going strong. Radio works great, but still it works very good. I hope to get my laser lens cleaner and clean the CD player soon, the CD player needs dusting. Only thing that does not work since 2008 was the the cassette deck, everything else such as connections to the stereo mixer to PC for online radio entertainment still going strong. I need to just get the cassette deck working, then it will be better. I am looking for an upgrade for a new version of this stereo system still. I like stereos with extra surround speakers. They need to make more stereos like this even with a DVD or blu-ray disc changer."
3,Classic Eddie,"Good, solid early Eddie Murphy movies. These were made back when he was still learning his craft & they were both decently entertaining...both when I saw the original releases & now. Nolte was perfect for his role too...back when he was a good dependable actor. The movies had pretty good supporting actors too (the first moreso than the sequel). Overall, a respectable effort of "" classic"" '80s popularmoviemaking."
4,An Awesome Double Feature!!!,"48 Hrs.- I thought this was a really good 'buddy cop' film. Eddie Murphy and Nick Nolte made a great team. When Detective Jack Cates needs help to find a bad guy named Ganz, Jack seeks the help of Ganz's former partner, Reggie Hammond who is a con-artist and a thief. Jack gets Reggie Hammond on parole for 48 hours so Reggie can help him find Ganz. I highly recommend 48 HRS!!!Another 48 Hrs.- I thought this was just ok and not as good as the original. Years have passed and Reggie is serving another prison term. This time, Jack is on the verge of having his badge taken away, and needs Reggie's help again to find Ganz's brother, and someone called the 'Iceman' I'd recommend ANOTHER 48 HRS!!!"
4,Good product- somewhat difficult to install,"Good product, works as described. However, if walls are not square it will be a challenge to install."
5,One of the Greatest Bass Books Ever Written,"I got a hold of this book when I was still wet behind the ears as far as bass fishing goes. I'm not a huge reader, but I couldn't put this book down. Roland talks about how to be observant and pick a pattern apart, including everything from lure color to presentation speeds. He really reveals it all when he's talking about these patterns. He gives the time of year, water temp, clarity, etc.I gained a tremendous amount of confidence from reading this, as these are some of the patterns that earned him 9 B.A.S.S. Angler of the Year titles.I've only been seriously fishing for about a year and there's no telling how many of these patterns I've used. I did skip over the parts on trolling and live bait, as they are not allowed in tournaments.But an excellent book, as I refer to it over and over."
3,Disappointing Presentation,"Although I bought this book in the Kindle edition, I expected that it would have the same quality of pictures as the hard cover.This is simply a copy of the hard cover with poor quality scanned b &w; photo's that are almost illegible.Good information on the subject in a disappointing Presentation.Michael"
1,extremely strong awful smell,"This product smells so severely strong of fish that I had to take it out of my home immediately. My cats literally took off running to the far end of the house when they smelled it, and my cats don't usually turn anything down. It's a really foul smell that permeates everything and won't go away. I can't get the smell off my hands no matter how hard I scrub. It's not even the typical fish smell that would attract cats, it's a very different fish smell. Luckily I only lost six bucks on the product."
1,Cat's Wouldn't Touch It,"I purchased the Salmon oil in hopes that it would help my cats dandruff clear up. Only problem is, they won't touch their food if I put on any of this oil. I've even tried to stir it into the wet food and they still walk away. The pump bottle does work well but I'm hoping there's another product that might not be so offensive and the cats will actually consume it with their food."
1,Grizzly salmon oil,My cats would not touch this salmon oil. Perhaps because it has the herb rosemary in it. The Amazon site for this product does not list rosemary as an ingredient.
4,two cats,"Pro: I have a cat who gets medicine crushed up in baby food twice a day. She's finicky, but if I add the salmon oil to the food along with the medicine, she's much more likely to eat it all up. She really seems to like it.Con: Messy, messy, messy. The oil leaked out of the pump mechanism. But the pump is slightly better than the flip-top bottle of another salmon oil brand I tried."
1,"contains rosemary, so not good for cats but ok for dogs","Product description on this page does not disclose that this product contains rosemary (used as a natural preservative). Unfortunately (in my experience), most cats do not like rosemary. Additionally, there is some controversy whether rosemary is even safe for cats to ingest as cat biology cannot handle most plant essential oils safely. Dogs should have no problem with this (same salmon oil is sold for both dogs and cats, just different packaging), but I would look elsewhere if you have cats. Amazon customer service processed a return credit for me on this item with no issues - one of the reasons I like shopping here so much! Thanks Amazon!!!"
3,Mono phone jack review,"I purchased this as a power plug, so I cannot say how it works for other applications. I did purchase it to case/chassis mount it, but the nut that came with it does not grip onto the threads. This means that I could not case mount it. I am not going to bother returning this as it was $0.98 I simply attached it using epoxy to the case instead, and everything seems fine. Would not recommend if you are chassis mounting."
2,Not too bad,"I learned some point regardig how to be in harmony with Japanaese . However I expected to learn more about their thinking , thier point of view etc..As i living now right there in Japan i think this book is incomplete regarding their social attitude."
1,Wolfgang Puck Food Processor/Blender,"I did not know it was not new, but it looks so good and well made. It lasted me only 3 Months and was broke. I would say, never buy anything refinished or repaired."
4,"""What Jazz Is"" is what jazz is!","Bravo Mr. King! As a professional musician for over forty years, I am happy to discover that we finally have a writer whose diction, voice and obvious passion for jazz are worthy of this great American art form. The author's descriptions and analyses of the music, itself, and each component of style and instrumentation are first-rate. Mr. King delineates what every jazz musician inherently knows, but may not have the ability to articulate. This is a great book for players, and an even more important books for those wishing to understand this vibrant, dynamic musical genre."
5,Tremendous introduction to jazz,"What an absolute pleasure to sit down on a rainy afternoon with Jonny King's book open to the chapter on ""Ballads,"" reading his affectionate deconstruction of Hank Mobley's ""Remember"", playing Mobley's CD at the same time and listening along ... then listening again, and again, hearing new things every time. King's enthusiastic and accessible analyses open doors for those of us who have always liked jazz, but never fully appreciated its structure and nuances because we don't play an instrument and haven't known precisely what to listen for. I fervently hope the author is working on Volume Two."
3,cord for my CD player,"I ordered this cord as a replacement for my CD player, but it did not fit as it was supposed to."
2,Almost.,"Hitch made a few movies that almost cut it, but didn't. Frenzyis one of them. A good plot, admittedly, but mishandled andoverplayed enough to be grating at times."
5,Frenzy is a top-notch thriller.,"Frenzy was the first Alfred Hitchcock film to earn an R rating (Psycho later got an R rating when released to home video). And it is definitely one of his most suspenseful ventures into the perversity of man. In it, London is being terrorized by a criminal known only as the Necktie Murderer, who goes around, luring in women, then raping them and strangling them with his necktie. Pretty soon, an innocent man is accused of the crimes because if the overwhelming circumstancial evidence and must elude the police and find the real killer in order to clear his name."
4,Very Excellent!,"I must say that this was one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films....like all the rest! LOL. I think though that becuase of the gruesome, desterbing scenes in this film it kind of messes up his ussual films. When I first saw this film (four days ago) I was not expecting it to be that.....I don't know...gruesome, desturbing parts. The one scene in which it's a rap-murder scene really set me off. It was SO detailed, so desturbing, so...terriable but true to it's affect I had to fast forward parts. The thing that bothers me is that he showed many naked scenes and it was as if the whole 'Psycho' affect ruined his formula. Still, I would have to say it's probably his last 'GREAT' film. Bravo Hitchcock!"
5,frenzy,"this is one of Hitchcock's best films! I have an issue with my internet speed and i was unable to stream the film with my compute but this film from this era is ""Fantastic"" the precursor to ""Blue Velvet"""
3,FRENZY!!!!!!,"""FRENZY"" IS Hitchcock's most mature and violent film.It's not Hitch's best like other of his films like PSYCHO or THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH or SABOTEUR.But FRENZY still is not bad.Its just typical Hitchcock.In London a murderer known as the necktie murderer(Barry Foster),terrorizes London.The rapist killer frames a friend (Jon Finch)and police trie to find the framed man.The killer murders more victims framing Finch."
2,Frenzy DVD,"I was very disappointed with this specific DVD. This version has been edited and is missing several crucial scenes.This is still a good movie, but just make sure to watch the complete (un-edited version)."
3,"Not the Best, but Pretty Good","FRENZY was made in the twilight of Hitchcock's career, so don't expect the suspense and quality of PSYCHO or THE BIRDS. This is an average movie that is a cut above horror films today. It's about London being terrorized by the brutal Necktie Murderer, a killer who rapes women then strangles them with his necktie. A loser is blamed when his ex-wife is killed, but it's someone else who's framing him. This was Hitch's first film to feature nudity, which is limited to discreet breast shots (think TITANIC). The dinner scenes between a husband and wife a darkly funny, with some VERY disgusting dishes being served. (Squid, anyone?) There are a few classic Hitchcock touches, like the scene where Brenda's secretary returns. We know that Brenda's dead, and we wait and wait for her scream. The suspense builds somewhat towards the end, but the plot isn't all that original or engaging. Still worth a look though."
5,"""Minor"" masterpiece by the great Hitchcock","Gritty and very un-Hollywood, this movie explores many of Hitchcock's favorite themes, but with a new look and a new edge to them. The most effective shot is when Rusk guides the girlfriend up to his room, ""Have I told you you're my type of woman,"" he says as he closes the door. The camera very slowly pulls back, down the stairs, across the street, where the sights and sounds of life go on as normal, and where the camera lingers, filling the viewer with the hope and expectation that she'll escape and emerge from the building. Of course, it doesn't happen -- we know what is really happening, after his disturbing murder/rape of Blaney's ex-wife. Technically brilliant."
5,Hitchcock's best,"OK, to say that a film was Hitchcock's best is a major declaration, but I think ""Frenzy"" deserves that label. The plot is Hitchcock's classic suspense plot of an inoocent man thrown into a situation he has to prove his way out of, while avoiding those trying to catch him. So that may be cliche for Hitchcock, but it works. Its not the plot that matters here, its the way the plot is told. Very suspenseful, some very disturbing scenes (in that cool way), and the thing that makes this the best is the cinematography. Some of the shots and techniques used are just amazing. Speaking as someone involved with filmmaking, I have found myself obsessed over certain shots, watching them over and over for their brilliance. Maybe not accessible to the average viewer, I feel this is one for the seasoned macabre viewer, and possibly the epitome of what Hitchcock was trying to say with all his works."
4,BEST OF THE LAST,"Hitchcock staged a final rally here, twelve full years after ""Psycho"", nearly 40 years after ""The Man who Knew too Much"". It's all here: several grizzly female murder scenes accompanied by a classic chase of a potato truck, loaded with villlain,dead body, and conventional edibles. It seems that Jon Finch has this strange obsession for a certain ""type"" of female date, one that any dating service has trouble filling. Enter Barry Foster, who's been recently divorced and is looking for the type of help,and protection, that a ""friend""like Finch can provide. To reveal too much would ruin the film for those who have never seen it. Suffice to say that while this was not Hitch's final film, it was clearly the ""master"" at his septegenarian best."
5,Exalent,Frenzy is a great movie.It's Hitchcock's second best since Pshcho.Great camra shots.Sure it has nudity in it but that dosn't make it any diffrent from any other Hitchcock film.He his the master of suspence and he surtinly proves it in this.And sure it's rated R but don't forget that Psycho's origanal rateing was M.If you like Hitchcock this is a highly recamended film.On a scale of 1 to 10 Frenzy gets a 10.
4,Very good book,I have many friends who have this book. They told me to get it; so I did. I am very pleased with the book. I work with many Native Americans and they believe very much so in animals and nature. I did not realize the spiritual background of all God's creation.
5,animal speak,"this book goes right alone with what i do, help animals with spirit.I will be getting more books on this ."
2,I think its corny.,"If you are searching, by all means search and you will find. What I found in this book was that it wasn't for me. Animal wisdom is real, but the minute anyone tells it in a black and white style, I am suspect. That being said, spirituality is like water - it finds a way, any way for expression. This was one step in that direction for me. Definitely not an end point."
3,Different perspective on animals,"This book leans much on the mystical side for what I am used to, but I found it particularly helpful to identify the purpose of the presence of animals during my life. This is definitely a great reference for connecting with nature and self!!"
5,marvelous,"Excelent book, easy reading, diagrams and ilustrations hepls undertanding. A step by step introduction to power animals and the mystery and magic of mystic life, and how you can use it in our own life to heal or improve it."
4,A Fair Beginners Book,"Ted Andrew's book is a rather popular book on totemism for those new to the topic. His work, while good for a general overview on the subject, is certainly not the be-all and end-all of any kind of totemism. A lot of the books pages are taken up by an animal dictionary, which while an informative read, is somewhat counterintuitive to personal symbolism at times. One thing I do like about this book is that it doesn't directly bolster itself as being ""Native American"" or working off of ""genuine Native American totemism"" which it certainly is not of which you sometimes see in other books. However, the cover of the book and some of the drawings within the book itself may unfortunately give off that imprecision. Regardless, it is a rather good beginners book to totemism and working with animals."
5,One of a kind,"Every since my friend showed me her book I've been wanting to get my hands on it. This book is great. Not only does it tell you the medicine of over 100 animals it also gives you several ways to connect with nature and everything around you, including your own power totem. Ted Andrews is a wonderful author who not only wants you to be aware of the power that is within you, but the power that is all around you all the time. I highly recommended this book to any one who has a love for nature and animals or anyone who wants to reconnect with what they have lost!"
5,A must-have for studying animal totems and spirituality,"Animal Speak is an incredibly useful work for anyone interested in Totem Animals. Though it is geared towards a Shaman, it has good information for anyone interested in the spirituality of animals. Ever wondered why you collected pictures of wolves? Ever wondered why those elephant figurines are so appealing to you? This is the book for you. Check it out."
4,Animal-Speak: The Spiritual & Magical Powers of Creatures,Can't review yet as I have not really had a chance to read it. I have only glanced at it.
4,Animal Speak Book,"Interesting book and perspective on animals. I believe the Spirit communicates to us many ways, and this book helps us to understand maybe a little better."
5,Best book on totems and working with animals period!!,This book is one of most complete book on working with animals and totem which is open to all tradions which is nice to see i think this is a must read for imfomation in it it seems to be well reseached and practiced Enjoy the bookBlessed Be;
4,A rare find...,"One of the two books that I haven't found too tainted by the New Age to include in my bookshelf. Although, as always, I dislike the ""anyone can do this"" feel of this book, the information within on the totems is wonderful, and I commend him for stressing that just because Wolf happens to be a popualar animal right now does not mean that He is your guide. I've met too many who claim to be of Wolf who make the claim for their ego. But overall, a better find than most of the bull I find in the ""occult"" sections of the bookstores."
3,Interesting Book,"I bought this book out of interest, but I find myself not really using it. It's interesting to learn all about animal meanings, but its quite limited. Although it shows you practice, it is not very engaging, so maybe that's why I don't read it. I just use it to look up animal meanings. But it is still good meditative practice. I always think about when a new animal or insect that comes by, if it really was trying to tell me something. But I also stopped because I was afraid of tampering with unknown beings. Some spiritual books don't ever put warning tags like that, but I think it is something to consider."
5,Animal Speak,Ted Andrews book- Animal Speak- is a thorough treatment of the nature of all of God's creatures. I use it as a reference whenever I encounter one. His insights are right on.
5,Excellent as always,"Ted Andrews is simply on of the finest newage/spiritual authors out there. If you need solid information on totem work or simply understanding the animal kingdom, look no further. This is a well written fantasic book, and worth every cent."
5,Great book,Helped me get back to my native roots as a native American I can relate with this book very well. I would recommend it for anyone who wants to understand what it means to speak with animals.
3,Great info - difficult reading,"This book is a GREAT source of information. However, it's written in such a boring, and almost hard to follow way that it's difficult to read through. The book exceeds as something to pick up and look for one specific item, but if you're looking to learn anything it's a tough one to read."
4,Animal Totems are missing,"I really love Ted Andrews thought-provoking book, and I refer to it whenver I encounter a ""surprise"" animal in my life, or in my dreams. I just wish that he had included many more animals/ insects, such as bees, or skunks for example."
5,SPIRIT FILLED,THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST SPIRITUAL BOOKS NEXT TO MY BIBLE THAT I OWN . MOST TREASURED . WOULD NOT WANT TO BE WITHOUT MY COPY TO MAKE REFERENCE TO ALL THE TIME
5,beyond what we expected,"Excellent reading, extremely informative. Family of six and we are all enjoying this book."
3,An interesting work,"I am keeping this book as a reference. It doesn't keep my attention the way that Nature Speak did, or even Enchantment of the Faery Realm, but it contains all sorts of interesting information about animals, both scientific and spiritual. Ted Andrews' writing always makes me smile, and this book did too, but it wasn't as easy to read cover to cover, probably because the info I wanted was broken up by both exercises and encyclopedic info about the totem animals, birds, reptiles, etc."
5,Excellent,"This is an amazing book. It is well worth the price for the reference material alone. I find myself keeping it out and handy to ""find out more"" about something. Well written and useable information, I highly recommend it!"
2,Not really what I wanted.,"It's not a bad book really, but it is hard to do the meditaions as you turn the pages. I don't think you can really teach a reader to meditate by the written word."
5,Animals Speak,Excellent reference book for those of us seeking our spirit guides and spirit animals. We use it an Shaman Drumming once a month. This book makes our journey more understandable.
5,Good idea Jerry!,"This book was excellent at giving me some insite into Jerry Springer. There is no mega ego in the writing of it, nor any kind of attitude. He wrote it himself on a whim. It does give you an uncensored look into Jerry Springer, & show. It does not have nude photos, nor is it erotic reading. If that is what you are looking for, look elsewhere. This book, if it does nothing else, will enlighten you to the exploits of our daily news (everywhere). It might even refresh your views on what America is really about."
4,Fun book to read,"I liked this book -- read it an evening. Gives you a look at Springer's childhood, early family life, and his political career. I was a bit disappointed in some ways because I felt that the details were fairly cursory in nature. However, the book does give a good idea at what goes on behind the show. A must for all Springer fans."
5,Very Funny Movie,"I've loved watching this movie since I was a child. This movie came out when Jerry Springer was very popular. Even though the story line is not that good, the movie is extremely funny. My favorite part is when they are on the plane headed to Los Angeles and they argue and scream at each other in front of everyone."
5,I thought this was an awsome book!!!,I thought this was the BEST book!!! (Maybe because Im obsessed with Jerry Springer...) I thought all the pictures were very good and it had some good info about Jerry and his show. LOVE YA JERRY!!!
1,"Can't We Do Better, Springer?","This book is only worth reading if you really adore the Springer show. If your going to right a book about the Springer show, talk about some of the episodes that are too graphic for T.V! Do better next time!"
4,Good...well thought out...lots of humour,Jerry Springers book gave a great insight into the world of talk shows. Use of humour and honesty was well thought out
1,Boy I never walk out of a movie but....,"This movie was without question the biggest waste of an hour and a half I have ever seen. The plot, what little there was of one, was sheer stupidity. Better acting can be found in most junior high plays, and the jokes were just not funny. I don't mind the Jerry Springer I see on television but this was flat out asinine. Do not waste your money on this movie."
1,Why Michael Dudikoff?,"You are the American Ninja, not trailor park fungus. Michael Dudikoff was the reason I bought this movie and he should be ashamed for being in this movie, such lordage shouldn't go so low. I was disappointed. ""Ringmaster"" is one of the worst movies ever. My dog could've made a better movie. Jerry Springer is one of the most controversial talk-show hosts ever, indeed, but his presence is limited in this movie thankfully. Too bad those security guards on the show couldn't have let those ignorant people fight each other. What a waste of time. My clock is ashamed of me for watching this by deservingly not letting me get my 90 minutes back."
2,NOT ALL it's craked up to be,"I suppose this book is a fast fun read. I didn't particularlly likethe book. I'd say about 50% of the of pages are actually written by Jerry, the others are either a half-page of pictures or contributions by the Jerry Springer Show staff. I guess, if you are BIG fan of the show, you'll feel this book is a must, I'm a fan, but when I finished reading the book, I was left with, ""what was the reason I read this again?"". Jerry constantly reminds the reader that he was a Jew and constantly seems on the defense, it makes for an uneasy read. I will admit Jerry does dish out the trash we've come to expect from him, like the story about the man who ""loves"" his horse. The most interesting thing I learned from this book was that pre-op transexuals all have a similar unique stench to them (due to the hormone pills they take).The book cover may have decorative sparkles on it, but this book doesn't shine."
5,Since This Is Bacically A Life Story I Can Not Give It...,"Since This Is Bacically A Life Story I Can Not Give It...LessThan 5 Stars...But I Really Was Hoping For It To Live Up To What JerryHad Said Would Be In It:An Uncensored Guide To The Back Stage Of The Worlds Greatest Talk Show.But It Really Was Not Exept For Around 50-100 Pages.But Please Do Not Think There Are Nothing But Useless Babble Because He Talks About How His Parents Saved His Famlies Lives From The Sick Nazis And Then Went To England And Eventually To America.There Is Alot More In There Such As His Political Life And His Staggering Personal Life.A Very Good Book That Could Have Had A Different Sub Title So Some People Would Not Waste Their ""Precious"" Time With It.But Not TO Me,It HAs In Some Aspects Changed My Views On Certain Things.Well That Is My Review,I Could Be Wrong,But Hey.......I Highly Suggest It...."
1,Ay Ay Aye....,"Another Round DVD, it plays a movie. If you're seriously interested in this movie, you're probably still using Beta Max tapes..."
3,Depressed? Watch This!,"This weekend I was depressed. I felt I didn't make enough money, am stuck in a dead-end computer job, up to my neck in debt, am fat and ugly (I'm a 38 Asian-Latino male with braces!), and had serious doubts about my current relationship until I watched this movie. This movie made me laugh at my self-doubts, with a truly ridiculous zing. This movie proves no matter how bad things can get, there are a lot of other Americans out there with lives much worse than mine. I'm a big fan of Jerry Springer. I think he shows the side of America most of us want to sweep under the rug. As his interview on Good Morning America pointed out, it's acceptable when Arnold or Bruce show violence. Or, it's acceptable when our elected governmental officials sleep around, embezzle, or yell at one another during law making sessions. No one tells the story of these people, except him."
3,An Entertaining Read,"Jerry Springer is the first to admit his television show is a circus.Still, there's something that millions of people are tuning in for - the outrageous topics and warrring guests on ""The Jerry Springer Show"". This book is a bit like watching an episode of the show: fun, but eventually you get overloaded with enough wacky information.It's also like the show in that you'll forget about it soon after reading it.Jerry lets us learn a little bit about his past and how he came to host such a bizarre 'chat' show. The writing style is very informal which makes this a quick, easy read.The perfect companion for a few free hours, but if you can't stand the show...stay well clear. There's nothing here to persuade you to like either Jerry or the show if you don't already."
3,Just as much white-trash as there is on the show,"This show is really tasteless and brings out the worst in people, but I love it. Making a a movie on it was probably a bad idea though. I eas expecting one 2-hour long show of Jerry Springer, or some really funny shows all mixed together. I wasn't expecting actors to portray white-trash guests on Jerry Springer and try to make it a drama, not a comedy. I found parts of it entertaining, like in the beginning when Jaime Pressley's mom went out and slept with her Pressley's boyfriend for revenge. But really, this movie is trash."
4,Another great Rendell read.,"When C.I. Reg Wexford pays a visit to his new doctor,Raymond Akande, the doctor confides in him that his daughter Melanie has been missing from home for a few days after supposedly staying the night with a girlfriend. Most of the characters in this book revolve around the local employment and benefits office and the off-beat customers who spend much of their time there.The body of one of the clerks at the employment office is discovered and Wexford establishes a link between her and the coctors missing daughter.The story is tightly written with the characters well defined--a good fast read."
4,Chef Inspector will hunt in the suburbs of England...,"People lack the time for reading books; you may be concerned about the thickness of the book, do not!A girls disappearence could not be more mysterious.Chief Inspector Wexford's reasoning power is just behind the truth which disappears with every new fact untill the last page of the book.The girl was last seen alive in an unemployment office... was she?You find yourself in a maze of events which drag you from backstreets to reality; and then back again.This book will be the beginning of Ruth Rendell series which are a fine blend of real life atmosphere and fiction.The taste will still be there, and you will be hungry for more!"
3,meh,"Too many characters confuse the crime, the story and the point. Rendell is a good writer but her books are tedious affairs."
4,A Quite Different Story Line,"Everyone knows that Ruth Rendell is one of the the best writers out there (in any genre). This book did not disappoint me. She handles this story about the disappearance of a young black girl with her usual style. It's a realistic story about the lives of what are sometimes called the disenfranchised people, or the people in a community that no one really notices. Wexford is faced with one of the most difficult cases in his career when he sets out to find this girl. To him it's almost like trying to find a ghost. And on his way he uncovers a horrific story about what happens to some people from other races who manage to slip into England under the radar. He can't believe it happens in his lovely little home of Kingsmarkham. But he does manage to solve the mystery, and get the right people in jail in the end. Only Rendell can handle a story that is this complex without letting any of her readers get lost in the process of trying to figure it out."
3,A fine substitute for Unisom,"Rendell is undoubtedly one of the most brilliant novelists of our time, but frankly, I was neither entertained nor held on the edge of my seat by SIMISOLA. Although the book is well-plotted, it is extremely slow-paced and has very little action to propel the story forward. The author deals with a number of issues in this novel, including racism and slavery, and also explores and contrasts the extravagant wealth of the upper class with the poverty and poor conditions of the unemployed lower class. While Rendell is undeniably gifted both at constructing a story and discussing a number of social issues, SIMISOLA is dull and it took me a long time to finish."
2,A LONG WAY TO GO FOR CHARACTERS I COULD HARDLY REMEMBER,"It was a chore getting through this book. It wasn't a bad book, but I didn't enjoy the journey to the end."
2,there is nothing new in this DVD,"There is nothing new in this DVD, unless you are a teenager or have very little experience in sex. Besides, the actors in it look like they are in 1980, very old-fashioned. Maybe it is fine with people who still live in eighties, for me it was a turn-off. Looks cheap and cheesy as well. I consider this purchase a waste of money and would never buy any other DVD of that collection.If you are really interested in learning something new to spice up your love life and would like to see something attractive I suggest you get Kama Sutra The Sensual Art of Lovemaking in 2 DVDs instead. It is a real pleasure to watch, although not all of it is practical, unless you are an acrobat, most of it is useful and very beautiful."
5,very realistic,"Excellent tool for enhancing your love life, very romanticand candent scenes, best soft porn for people who do not reallyengage in watching a lot of porn movies, but need a little extra information to rekindle the intimacy with that significant other."
5,"Twisted,powerful,dark and brilliant.","Hanky Panky is a combination of brooding melodies, sung with an acute range of emotion and understanding. Matt Johnson triumphs yet again with an album of utter originality and dark forboding giving an amazing twist to a set of already brilliantly concieved songs. Highly recommended!"
5,"Still Fabulous, 17 years later...","Truly an incredible testament to both Hank Williams and Matt Johnson. Infectious guitar and harmonica, at-times haunting vocals, danceable rythyms. An all-time favorite from my all-time favorite band."
5,Can we have some more please Matt?,"This is a masterpiece no doubt about it.Can we have another one Matt? Please, please, please?Now I own most of The The's catalogue, and most of Hank Williams as well."
3,The The Tweaks Hank Williams,"Well, it's nowhere in the ballpark of The The's ""Dusk"", which is what I'd reserve 5 stars for easily. Here they do a lot of Hank Williams covers and tweak 'em out enough to make a semi-cohesive The The album. But to tell the truth, I wasn't overly impressed. There are a few songs that are pretty cool under the influence of an acidic guitar and Matt Johnson's wry vocals, but for all of that, I think I'd have rather just heard Hank sing his songs. In a nutshell, while it may be worth a listen, this is not a good first album if you're just checking out The The. I could bear to part with this album."
1,Horrendous.,"Matt Johnson is one of my favorite artists; the poetry of his lyrics is sublime and his music is uniquely haunting. Hanky Panky is a tremendous disservice to both the ""The The"" concept and to Hank Williams, Sr. Avoid it."
5,If I could give more stars.....,"I am huge fan of good music and good lyrics. That said, even though I hate country music, I love Hank Williams. There just hasn't been another songwriter like at his level, with the exception of maybe Dylan. I recently bought the Timeless Hank Williams tribute CD, which I enjoyed, but with the great artists appearing on that compilation I just expected more. Then I heard about this CD. This disc is NOT made up of country remakes.... this CD is all rock and blues. And that's okay because Hank was a rock/blues singer at heart anyway. Matt Johnson does a great job on these songs, and after hearing this disc, it inspired me to listen to more of The The. What a great band, and what a great CD. Johnson is in touch with Hank Williams' emotions on every song. Best tribute CD... ever."
4,Neither fish nor fowl,"This album has gotten considerable flack because it winds up being neither Matt Johnson or Hank Williams. But I think the synergistic effect works well, and I admire Johnson for the integrity and fearlessness it must take to record an album of revisionist covers of country classics by one of the greats. Closer to the sound of The The than Williams, which is in my mind far from a bad thing. However, the slow songs tend to drag, though few are longer than 2 minutes. A must have, if only for ""Honky Tonkin',"" ""I'm A Long Gone Daddy"" and ""I Saw the Light."""
1,Hose Too Narrow,"I'm not the DIY type, but Amazon has better pre-made ones than this. I bought this as a gift because it was super cheap, but I was informed the tube is much too narrow (think it's a little smaller than a quarter) causing a ton of foam to build up which makes using this difficult. I guess the valve is a bit difficult to use too. I'd say choose another one from the site and make sure the tube is wider than this!"
3,good but not so good,this book gave good examples and explains pretty weel. but the way of doing exercises is wrong. for example wa and ga are used in some specific ocassions but both mean the same thing. one is to introduce the other is to continue with a topic. the book uses as exercise problems sentences. but for wa and ga you need a paragraph to know when you properly should use them.
1,dissapointed,bought this for my 7 yr. old and she was not impressed prolly played once then moved onto another game! Very dissappionted!!!
2,Must be able to read to play!!,"Cute concept, not that hard but my daughter is 6 and not reading enough to have fun with this game, and there is A LOT of reading. You basically can't do anything without reading the instructions they give you via conversations between Miley and her friends. I have to sit with my daughter whenever she wants to play. That is the downside I think, once you are old enough to read, it might be too simple of a game to enjoy."
1,Stupid and Pointless,The game has only about three challenges before it ends. I finished in about 15 minutes. I would be angry if I hadn't gotten it for free.
3,You have to have a lot of patience for this game,I was so excited to get my daughter the Hannah Montana game but when I sat down to play it myself....I was not at all impressed. It is slow and requires a lot of reading each time you have to find a clue. It goes through an entire scene until you are released to a mission. Not my favorite but you might enjoy.
3,Too easy,"I guess when I bought this game I liked Hannah Montana. But Hannah Montana's childish to me now, and this game shows it. It's way too easy, and its just too easy and going to the same places gets old. I mean when you play it its fun but then it just ends too quickly and you don't want to play again."
2,Hannah Montana,I bought this for my daughter's 6 th birthday and she has found it a little difficult to play. I feel this game is much better suited for the 8+yr olds. There is a lot of reading throughout the game and at her age she got bored and frustrated before finishing it.
1,Stupid and Boring,"I got this game because I like the show Hannah Montana. This game is so stupid! I spent my Christmas money on this game . I am very mad about this. I want my money back. The graphics are worse than the game. You go around playing Miley. It is so stupid, just let the world know Miley is Hannah Montana. I finished this game in about a hour. You can try the game, but you will be thanking me if you don't buy the game. The game is also so boring. I am never going to buy a disney game again."
2,hannah montana ds a little difficult,Both my children (8 and 5) complained that this game seemed a little difficult.
2,An O.K. Game,"I am 13 and a half years old, and I love the show Hannah Montana, and I love Miley Cyrus, that is why I got it. I Started playing this game, is was fun at first, then it got really anoying. You do like the same tasks over and over, it's really anoying. I got a head ache from the music, and I beat this game in less than two hours. I wouldn't recomend for any one, only if you are really bored one day. It is fun when you go into Hannah's closet you can dress her, but you can't do any thing else. At the end it is a surprise but it's cheesy. Hope you follow my advice, I will probably ask my dad to put this game on ebay, because I don't want to play it any more, so I will just sell it."
4,"Good, but could be better.","O.k., this game could be better. It's kind of annoying, because you're all over the place. You may be at the mall and then have to go to the beach and then right back to the mall! I'm 13, and I thought this game was kind of easy. It will probably be hard for little kids. It's probly just perfect if you are 10,11,12, and possibly 13. It was a good game and you should buy it."
4,I love this game! <3,"I just recently bought this game and love it! It is so much fun! I love the show Hannah Montana so I thought I would give this game a shot, and im totally glad I did! You get to live the life of Miley Stewart and try to solve mysteries including all the original characters(Oliver, Jackson, Robbie Ray, Amber, Ashley, and Rico). If your a girl ages 6-14 i definetly suggest this game to you!!"
1,I dont know yet,"Hi, I just bought this game yesterday at bestbuy. I have not tried it out yet and I am looking forward to playing it.(thats why I put one star for the ratings.)I will read everyone elses reviews and see what this game is like. If you are reading my review right now, please reply to it when you write YOUR review. Thanks, my name is Hannah by the way. See ya l8er!!"
1,Not a good textbook,"This book was used in an upperlevel course titled: Indians of the Great Plains. The book was full of fact after fact and run-on paragraphs. It was a difficult read for me, I couldn't retain the barrage of information. The instructor didn't even use the book and rarely mentioned it. As a result, my university bookstore is not buying the book back for next semester. The only useful part of the book was the timeline at the end."
3,Seasoning,"Very miss lead by the size of this product. Guess I should have not gone by the enlarged picture. However, very concentrated and enjoyed each time I added to our food."
1,"Horrible, trite, melodramatic...","...this film is not true to Vonnegut's story, nor does it havethe story's subtlety. The acting is poor, the dialogue inane, and theoverall effect is of a bad, made-for-television movie. ... On the other hand, _Slaughterhouse Five_ and _Mother Night_ are brilliant adaptations of Vonnegut's work. They are much more worthy of your time and money."
3,Foreseeing PC Dystopia,"A cautionary tale of political-correctness taken to its logical extreme in a leftist dystopia that enforces ""equality"" and no one is permitted the freedom of achievement or failure, since everyone is made to have the same ability ---whether they like it or not. Mediocrity and standardization are enforced on citizens by a totalitarian socialist government of well-meaning know-better elites (who are of course exempt from their own rules) until one young man rebels and threatens their order. In the vein of Orwell's ""1984"" or Animal Farm, this is a classic allegory for left-wing authoritarian hyprocrisy and supression of the individual's identity in favor of the ""group."""
4,By all means...buy.,"It's NOT the short story on film...but it IS a creative interpretation, unexpectedly well-done, entertaining and likely to motivate those who haven't, to read one of the GREATEST short stories."
3,Comprehensive but too Superficial,"This introductionary book about Japanese politics from Louis D. Hayes gives a comprehensive overview on Japanese politics and the political system as well as reaches toward the society, culture, and the economy. It is very well organized and written with great insight. Neverteless it fails to go beyond the surface (this seems to be partly the result of the far-reaching scope of the book). Furthermore this updated version seems not to have been sufficiently rewritten because the changes since 1993 seem not to fit into the overall frame of the book. I have not read the older editions but sometimes the texts seem not to be cohesive and misses the main argument. A traditional approach to writing text books (highlighting the important aspects, study guides, etc.), furthermore, would make the reader profit more from the text. When I read a chapter I cannot always retain enough information to make a coherent arguement about the political developments in Japan."
2,Why the music industry is failing,"This movie shows you a weird shrinking bubble in the music industry, inside of which are a lot of old guard music executives, producers and hangers on (like the photographer at the center of the story) with a lot of influence and money, yet completely caught up in their nostalgia for the good old days. Why is it so important for Robert Knight to find the next young white blues hot shot? When has this music made any kind of cultural or financial impact on the music scene? It's truly remarkable how much time and resources they put into jump starting this Taylor Bryant kid's career. The likelihood of this kid becoming a true visionary of the guitar like Jeff Beck or Steve Vai is highly unlikely. It's depressing to see how much time and money is wasted shoehorning this kid into success, when there are so many other creative and innovative rock bands that would take off if they could just be heard."
4,A more focused conclusion to Talon's tale.,"This is the second book (after Talon of the Silver Hawk) that closely follows Talon as he further infiltrates himself into Duke Kaspar's inner circle. It is fast-paced, includes more hints of the larger war of good vs. evil, and shows a somewhat less perfect and thus more believable life for Talon. Rather than the nearly novel-length ""making of"" a super spy that was Talon of the Silver Hawk, this book is more tightly focused, which is a good thing. It is still a less epic tale than most of the others in the various Riftwar series, but serves its part in setting up the next trilogy."
4,Satisfying sequal to Talon,"Even more so than Talon, King of the Foxes kept me entertained and turning the pages. Tal deepens and becomes a more complex character. The overall driving forces of the story begin to flesh out (I came to Talon a new Feist reader lacking the background of previous books.) Tal has a clearer enemy, more focused objective. The magic and behind the scenes good/evil struggle are more developed make more sense in King than they did in Talon, though still could have been left out without much change to the plot and action. This book departs from the good-guy-always-prevails predictability of Talon; a good thing.Very readable prose and a well paced plot make for an enjoyable read."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Cooking a way out.Tal, now fit for upper class society and an expert swordsman is playing his role. However, it is not all fencing and fun as he ends up in prison in a very isolated location, and some rather severe punishment.His cooking skills enable him to get the bored guards onside and start plotting a way out of a bad situation, to further his revenge on Kaspar."
4,A Pretty Good Feist Novel,"This was really a pretty good novel by Mr. Feist. It has all the action one expects out of the characters born and bred in the author's world of Midkemia as well as court intrigue and some superficial emotional baggage. Talon of the Silver Hawk, aka Squire Talwin Hawkins, has quickly become a character that, while I do not love him, I am very fond of him.King of Foxes is better, in my humble opinion, than it's predecessor Talon of the Silver Hawk, in that Tal's character does seem to grow a bit more. And, though he is still slightly too powerful, he does make mistakes and gets hurt. The only real problem I have with this book, in fact, is his reversal when he became hurt. I would have liked to have seen how he adapted. Otherwise, it was a great novel and I cannot wait for the third. Pick it up and read it. You'll love it."
3,Good but not up to Feist's usual standards,"I enjoyed this book. Enjoyed, not loved. Feist is on my favorite authors, but every once in a while comes up with a clunker. This is not a clunker, nor is great. It is average. I enjoyed the storyline(nothing unexpected happens), but I didn't get emotionally involved in the character. Better luck next time. This one is a book to check out from the Library, but not to buy."
4,King of Fantasy!,"For well over 20-some-odd years now Raymond E. Feist has been one of the top fantasy writers that has stayed consistent in giving us readers solid fantasy epics.And in the 2nd volume of the Conclave of Shadows trilogy he once again proves he can still propel readers into high adventure in a fantasy realm fraught with danger and intrigue and excellent and impressive characters of both Good and Evil...and something in between.A must read for fantasy readers, as well as historical readers."
4,A Very Good Middle Book In An Entertaining Series,"I hadn't read a Feist novel in quite some time. Frankly, given some of his more recent work I'd been told I hadn't missed much. I loved his first series Magician, et. al....Those were truly fun, enjoyable and well-plotted out novels. Anyway, my buddy at the local bookstar encouraged me to give this recent series a try. Boy am I glad I did. I'm enjoying this pulpy-type series very much and the middle towards the end of this novel was a true page-turner. I'm anxiously looking forward to Exile's Return.Good work Ray!"
5,LOVED IT!!!,"I have read and loved every book Raymond Feist has written and this one did not disapoint. I could not put it down once I started reading it. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to see how the main character, Talon, would avenge his people and find peace and purpose in his life. And the ending was perfect, tying up loose ends while allowing for more books about the Conclave of Shadows to follow. Feist is definitlely one of the best fantasy writers of the century!"
2,Somewhat Hurried,"It's a sad thing to find an author you've enjoyed for so long produce work you really don't like much.Feist's novels in the Riftwar and Empire (with Janny Wurts) series remain some of my favourite fantasy works, and I've enjoyed most of his other titles also.Talon of the Silver Hawk was okay, though somewhat contrived and artificial in the way it brought about its resolution. King of Foxes has the same problems, only more so. It seems hurriedly, even carelessly put together; I never really felt a great sense of reality from any of the characters, and the plot did not move forward so much as it was pulled uncomfortably by authorial intrusion.At the height of his powers, Feist can provide excitement, entartainment, and engaging characters as can few others. Foxes is nowhere near that height."
2,Time for something new,"Feist now has a bijillion books set on the same world that are all sequels of each other. It started to become obvious after the second trilogy that he is writing this world because he needs the money, not because he likes the characters, world, or anything else. The first Conclave of Shadows book was good - almost a renewal of purpose similar that reminds me of the obvious enjoyment in writing the first Magician books. The second book - King of Foxes - appears to be more a labor of deadlines and bills to pay then any type of interest in writing.After this, I may get the third book just to see who he bumps off but not unless I am really bored."
2,A book?,"I don't understand. This isn't Reba or the Dixie Chicks. Why is there a book about SheDaisy? In all honesty, I didn't even finish the book. It was that lame. Ok ok, I understand that every artist has a story.. but this reads more like they pulled this to earn another dollar. This is quite a let down for SheDaisy fans."
5,Great little book!,My son loves this series. Fun to read and highly recommend for your little reader.
3,"Useful, but not earth-shattering","This books is THE resource for level five edges, finally giving players a good chance on achieving them. It also includes a number of incredibly powerful (for Hunter, anyway) Divine and Corrupt edges, as well as suggestions as to how these alternate level fives would be achieved.Save this book for when you've been playing for a very long time, as it seems geared for spectacular ways to end a chronicle. For the majority of your chronicle, the level five edges presented in the corebook and nine Creed books are much more suited to the theme of the game, and the players guide already gives the storyteller enough information on how to portray an NPC with one.Unless your chronicle depends heavily on the Messengers being agents of the divine, and having their antithesis trying to corrupt the imbued, it really isn't that necessary. A very cool book though, and necessary for any Hunter fanatic to round out their collection."
5,TRUE HOCKEY MEMORBILIA!,"This work represents the finest photo collection of GORDIE HOWE'S career to date. If YOU are old enough to remember the epic battles between the Montreal Canadians and the Detroit Red Wings of the 1950's-60's, YOU can relive these times in photo concepts - eg. Howe's 545 goal in the Montreal Forum eclipsing Rocket Richards's record and the 15 minute standing ovation by Montreal fans; Howe's commentary on the Montreal dynasty once Jacque Plante and Jean Bellevue arrived on the hockey scene; the skilled fis-ti-cuffs of Gordie Howe against bad boy, Lou Fontinato of the New York Rangers; and Howe's best picks of NHL players he most admired! ... BUY TWO AND MAKE A FRIEND!"
2,Fodor's Healthy Escapes,I purchased this book based on previous experience with Fodor's books. The categories were helpful for a quick determination of the type of facility. The descriptions however seemed more like advertisements from the various facilities rather than informed experiences from the writers. The rates were not up to date and there are no web sites listed. Unbelievable for a travel book published in 2000!
4,Not What I Expected,"The thing that makes this film work is the range of moods/emotions that are covered. Comedy, nostalgia, eroticism and drama all have their turn, and have been blended into a shocking but suprisingly cohesive, whole.Monica Bellucci, while not presented any real acting challenges, plays her role well, and is appropriately cast as the target of a young boys fantasies. I've heard (and it's obvious in viewing the film) that several minutes have been deleted from the original version. It is plain to see that the censorship is the result of concerns over the American market. I can assume that the missing footage shows the erotic dreams of the boy, something that could have hurt the commercial success of the movie stateside. How sad that art has to be mangled in order to placate a small percentage of backwards thinkers. As good as this film is, I'm certain that the full version would be more cohesive."
2,Tragic Story,"This is a tragic tale of a woman who simply has bad luck as bad events, one after another unfold and she turns into prostitution. It is really depressing and some of things happen are just unbelievable and a downer and it's not really enjoyable to watch."
3,Four Stars for Monica,"The only beautiful part of this film is Monica Bellucci. She is absolutely stunning and her face and body spoke volumes. Not much of a story as the focus was on what an impact Malena (Monica Bellucci) had on Renato (Giuseppe Sulfaro). Such prevalent circumstances (where a young boy of 12 or 13 years of age infatuated with a married women whose curves and moves are ""talk of the town"") dwell in most villages. What really disappointed me was that Ennio Morricone's musical score did not make a mark. There were so many beautiful scenes where I am sure he could have flaunted his brilliance in composition as he did in Cinema Paradiso (still one of my all time favourite)."
3,well done,"It was interesting.Visually very satisfying. The story is sad, though another similar subject, Zorba the Greek, was much more powerful, this film certainly was well done."
2,Censored,"I love this movie. However, not the edited version. They have ruined the scenes and still rate is as rated R. Don't buy this."
3,"Inferior to the ""Malena Uncut"" version","It was obvious that scenes were missing in a most annoying way. Fortunately I persisted searching here on Amazon, and only when I entered ""Malena Uncut"" I was able to find the true uncut Special Edition import version from Korea in a really beautiful luxury boxed set of 2 disks, and Monica Bellucci nude from the waist up on the cover. Not sure what's wrong with Amazon's ""search"" but it leaves out that gem, which is at this Amazon link:Malena Uncut Special Edition 2 DVD Set [Import]"
2,Heavily Censored Malena,"Malena is a fine film. Sadly, you will not be able to see this film in the U.S. as Mirimax/Disney Home Video has heavily censored it for DVD release in the U.S. Monica Bellucci is a beauty, but to fully appreciate her in Malena, you'll need an Italian import of this DVD and a region-free player."
1,MISLEADING 'UNCUT' VERSION - IT'S CENSORED!,"With deleted scenes put back in, this is a 5-star movie. However, this 'Import, Uncut' version is CENSORED in a way that ruins the overall movie. Large, black blotches are used to block out pelvic anatomy without clothing, which now seems typical censorship for all these (Korean?) imports. If you don't think intimate scenes should be covered over with 'black spot' editing, and you're an adult that can handle seeing a naked body - send a message. Don't waste your money."
3,Monica Belucci's best movie,"This story have the world war two Italy as backround. The story focus on Malena, beautiful Monica Bellucci. We follow the life of Malena through the eyes of a young teenager.The story show the desire of mens and jealousy of other woman about Melena. There's a part of erotism and sensuality very well exploited. Unfortunately, some very interesting scenes where the teenager dream about a naked Malena are not on this North American edition. For that reason, I recommand the European version if your DVD player can read it. Despite that, this story is, with L'ENNUI (Sophie Guillemin) one of the rare movie to combine a good story with some erotism."
2,Don't Buy It,All reviews are right - Save your money on this edit version. If you're looking for Monica Bellucci go to MrSkin.com.
4,Great movie - too bad it was sanitized for Americans,"This is a classic story that reveals some of the uglier sides of human nature. Monica Bellucci is amazingly beautiful - I'm surprised she hasn't had wider exposure. She may be the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. It's a great story but parts were cut out of the original to sell it to the prudish American audience. Still, well worth watching."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CENSORED DVD !!,"Ok, the film is great, Monica is a good actress and in Europe she's one of the top female stars...But why release another censored version of this DVD? The tech details says it's 92 minutes, meaning 17 minutes are still missing (15% of the movie!) as was the case with the last release in which the movie did not flow right due to the heavy cuts.I have both the Itailan and Korean DVDs and they are UNCUT, but the Italian has no subtitles and the Korean has a below average image quality.Would Miramax please treat us as adults who can decide by themselves if a movie is appropriate or not and release an UNCUT version of this?Note that in NTSC(R1) the Uncut film is 109 minutes while in PAL (4% speed up) the uncut length is 103 minutes, so if you find a 103 version in pal(R2) buy it, it's the full version."
2,Great film....but this dvd release is total crap,"This has to be one of my favorite films. It is a shocking, powerful, and very tragic tale that leaves you breathless. I also think this is Monica Belluci's best role. However, with that said, this DVD release is total crap. I saw the international version earlier and really liked it, so I recommended to my friends that we rent it. To my dismay the american version was highly edited and terrible. They took out much of the ""questionable"" content, which resulted in a film with no flow and ultimately lacking in sense. It's ridiculous how our country has gone to such such extreme censorship procedures. I feel it is this kind of repression that really contributes to the moral decay of our country as a whole (sorry for being on my soap box...). I suggest anybody who criticized this film to see the real version as Tornatore intended it to be."
1,Only beauty is women's value,"The movie tells us: Women are the intolerant persons. Only beauty is their value.If a married woman start a rumor that the beautiful neighbor is a wanton who will make love with everyone, it will good for her marriage? I don't understand. I don't know why the movie talk scandal about married woman. Only single girls need to compete with Malena for men by the fact itself."
2,"Trite, empty, witless, and repellent","Yet another middlebrow cookie-cutter pseudo-art film from Miramax taking on the usual easy targets like Italian fascism. Lush production values are wasted on a practically non-existent plot, a repulsive male main character, and a female lead who remains a cipher throughout the entire film. The male lead's masturbatory obession with Malena is simply embarassing rather than amusing. Male viewers who rent this merely to satisfy their own obsession with Monica Belluci will be equally disappointed in the small number of ""good parts"" worth fast forwarding to (what few there are is the only reason this film gets two stars)."
3,"Not good, except for Ms Bellucci","If it wasn't for Ms Belluci this movie wouldn't even deserve one star.In the end, after watching this disappointing movie, what remains in the memory, is the girl, beautiful to the max. If I waited to the end it was only to see the lady walk by one more time.What a waste of extras and money, I guess. This film had too high expectations, but the director needs to go back to school and do his homework.By the way, what is the point of showing so vulgar scenes and language?This is a vulgar video clip with a gorgeous woman in it."
2,Movie 5 stars -- This Edtion 2 stars,"The review from Naked Truth ""KC"" is true. Even though product is advertised as ""UNCUT"", it actually is the uncut version but certain scenes are CENSORED which is very annoying. This version comes from Korea, and compared to the (original) version from Italy (which I later bought from VECOSELL) video quality is slightly worse. So considering the price + the censored scenes + worse video quality, I would not recommend it."
2,Where's the beef?,"Hey, first of all, Let me see the REAL MOVIE deserves five stars. But for this, It deserves two, and a lecture to the american distributors.I watched the movie and it turned to be the American Version (that means, the clean version). The Original version includes the extended passionate scenes of Malena and Amoroso, deleted by the inquisitorian hand of Miramax Films. Disney did it again.How come we expect the real deal if they cut boobs and butts when they are part of the story? Actually, you cannot mess with Monica Belluci's body, probably the most beautiful in Italy. So we movie lovers expect an apology.Miramax and Medusa films have to release an unrated version, I'm getting tired of scissors in movies, as Giuseppe Tornatore protested in ""Cinema Paradiso"". I'm pretty sure he's very angry with what they did with this beautiful movie."
1,Why do they do this?,"This DVD has so many scenes cut out it's not even the same story described in IMDB. It should be renamed ""A Boy and his Bicycle"". If you want to see a movie where half of it is a boy pedaling his bike, this is it. But it is so exasperating to watch a movie and know there are things missing. Why do they cut scenes out when I buy a movie to watch at home?? This version must be a record for the fewest lines spoken by the title character. She is only shown walking thru the town square. Don't buy this unless you want a major disappointment."
4,Sensual and artful,"Tornatore, director of ""Cinema Paradiso,"" combines the best of the best in this, his seventh feature:-The beauty and sensuality of italian model, turned actress, Monica Bellucci (Malena), who demonstrates that models can be good actresses.-The ingenuity of young Giuseppe Sulfaro, who was in charge of the very likeable character of Renato Amoroso, the boy that falls in love with Malena's beauty, which takes him through a trip that ends up as he's turning into a man, and perhaps one of the most ethical ones in his town.-An incredible cinematography that exploits the natural beauty of Siracusa, Italy, which combined with the beauty of the music put together by master (and long-time musical partner of Tornatore), Ennio Morricone, makes the movie the most delightful trip for the senses.In general, if you loved ""Cinema Paradiso"" and/or ""Life is Beautiful"" you'll deeply enjoy this movie and its story."
2,2 stars for artwork.,"This is one of the weirdest comics I've ever read. Superman vs Lobo is a cool fight, it's so cool they brought it back again. The only cool thing about this rag is the artwork. This has no actual story. No ending either. If your a ""Lobo complete-ist"" like me you'll be let down.BEGINNING It starts off with space aliens in the 1950s. They dump something into the water of Metropolis. Makes no sense, travel to present time. They're warning Superman to ""join or die"".MIDDLE Those aliens decide they don't got the proper tools to kill off Superman. So they hire Lobo. So they fight for a couple of pages.ENDING. There is no real ending, they wind up on that weird alien planet. This comic book doesn't make any sense.If you get a Lobo book, you know what to expect. That Lobo is going to go way over-the-top. That's what Lobo does he's a violent psychopath. But it's so over-the-top it's just funny.This book is just drivel, if anyone says it's good it's because their jumping on the bandwaggon."
5,FAST and GREAT!,Received the product in a matter of a couple days! Was not expecting it to come so soon! In awesome condition! Thanks!
2,Harder Lessons,"A lot of Denzel's early movies fall a little short, but because I am a lifelong fan and am in the process of collecting all of his movies (good or bad), I will have to recommend this movie. Honestly, it falls short of his later, greater stuff: it's dull, slow. But a must-have if you are collecting."
3,Handy planter,Intended this to be a teacup but has some cracking in the paint/glaze. Plus made in china so a little concerned about the glaze and paint safety.At any rate it now holds out scrubbers and sponge on the kitchen sink window sill.
2,Severe Disappointment,"I have all of Prong's albums and I was really hoping this one would grow on me. Unfortunately, it did not. I can appreciate the industrial sounds of modern acts like Rage and Tool, but when an established band like Prong changes their sound to keep up with trends, it looks like selling out. I feel the same about Danzig's last album."
1,Not Even Near,"I am gona put it in short words i buy this cd because i heard one song at a bar and the Dj told me it was Prong i dont know what hapened. being a person who likes and have many bands of industrial/metal i can say this is one of the worst albums i have ever heard if not the worst.the vocals , the simplicity of the music, the uninspired composition and sampling, there is not one point to save."
1,This was a good album???,I was disappointed with this album. It did serve one good purpose. The cd did make a great coaster.
1,Terrible waste of money,"This is merely a _promo_ set of the singles that were released in a magazine. The cds themselves say ""not for sale."" The box is interesting, however, each cd contains one song only, the song that appears on the album. You are basically buying the whole album on 12 cds, 12 promo cds, for fives times the price."
1,Not worthy at all,It's such a waste of money indeed.Buy the album instead. YOu'll save a huge amount of money
5,amazing tool,i did not expect this nailer. powerful and convenience. if you are a carpenter you should get this nailer. thanks amazon
5,Solid Product,"I recently purchased this item, I've yet to put it through its paces but in the few times I've used it, it works great. I love the features, lighted workspace, adjustable depth setting, but especially compressor and hose free!!! Pricey but the freedom of not hauling a compressor and hose around is worth it!"
1,Very Poor Humidifier,"I bought this humidifier to help relieve dry sinuses and was horribly disappointed. First of all, it was very loud. On the low setting it was barely tolerable, but on the high it was just ridiculous. Second, the box said it would run for 24 hours on one tank, however the tank ran out after about 12 hours (and that was on the low setting). Finally, and most importantly, it didn't make the room any more humid at all. It just goes to prove you get what you pay for. I just returned this, and based on other reviews I'm going to go and spend the $100 for a good Air-Swiss or Ventra."
3,you get what you pay for,"I got this humidifier at a very low price at an outlet store. I'd say it works ok, but the other reviews are true that the water tank only last 12 hr. at the most. I don't mind the noise level at all, because i use it in my children's rooms and the ""white noise"" is a help. My biggest complaint is that the filter gauge tells me that the filter is bad after only 4-5 days of use. Maybe i have very hard water (i fill it w/ tap water) and that's why the filter gets dirty quickly. So, if I followed the gauge, i'd be buying a new $10 filter twice a month!! No thank you!! Also, i cannot find the filters any more in the stores. I'm going to have to order them online. So why am going to keep this not-so-great humidifier?? Because I read lots of reviews on the best of the best humidifiers for $70-$200 and most require new filters just as often as my cheap one."
3,Lacks details,"This is not the best of the Groovy series, by far. It lacks a lot of detail compared to the others. Major hotels are left off completely (Chedi, Marina Cottages, Sheraton Laguna, etc.)and the nightlife detail is completely lacking (compared to, say, the Pattaya by Night map). It shows you where Soi Bangla is, but that's about it.There are only semi-detailed maps of Patong and Kata/Karon beaches. Anything outside that is virtually useless (forget this map if you're thinking of staying at Bang Tao beach)In summary, it gives a very general overview, but that's about it."
2,Poor excuse of a map,I agree with the previous reviewer. This map doesn't include very many hotels. Most of the hotels I've found on the internet are not on this map. There are only a few streets and fewer club listings.
5,The Macross Saga continues.,"A new generation has emerged from the ashes of the Zentradi conflict and has colonized the planet Eden. We again have the love triangle conflict but now in a ""Top Gun"" like environment. And while a terrible emotional secret resurfaces, the A.I. singing idol Sharon Apple gets in the way. Thumbs up, it's a great anime.! END"
5,A breakthrough in anime history.,"Using spectacular animation, a wonderful soundtrack, and a captivating story; the creators of the original Macross series (known here as Robotech) come through again to bring a truly remarkable title."
4,4 stars because of the end,"The major differences between the movie and the series is that the movie has some old scenes deleted and new scenes added. Certain sequences of events have been altered in the movie too.I was disappointed how they deleted the fight scene at the beginning. That truly sucked. However, they made Gauld's dogfight with the ghost more spectacular and his death more heroic, and more scenes were added to give Sharon more depth which gave you more of an understanding about her.If you own the series, i wouldnt bother with the movie edition. However, the movie is good in its own right, especially with the added scenes."
5,MACROSS PLUS - Brilliant,"Macross Plus is a superb 4 part OAV series centering around a man named Isamu. The Japanese animation is great, as usual, and the story is excellent. A great soundtrack also highlights the series, as Isamu and his former best friend, Guld go head to head to determine which model Valkyre (or something like that, I'm not too familiar with Macross, sorry) is better. There's much more to it than that, and everything unfolds into a stunning conclusion. A must for any anime fan."
3,Stripped down version of the actual 4-part series,This is merely a compressed version of the actual 4-part series. I would recommend purchasing those 4 tapes instead. That is truly one of the best anime offerings around.
1,Worst DVD transfer ever!,"What were Manga thinking releasing this? Hands down this is the grainiest, spottiest, mind-shatteringly terrible transfer I have ever seen. Read the review over at AnimeOnDVD to see what I'm talking about, wish I had read that first before purchasing. As for the movie? Going by some of the reviews here I expected this to be a classic anime the likes of Ghost In The Shell et al. Talk about Robotech/Macross fans seeing things through rose colored glasses. This film is all over the place, granted it was culled from a four part OVA, but even so, it truly is bad. I love mecha anime as much as the next guy, but there is little to recommend here. Go ahead and purchase based on the glowing reviews, but don't say you weren't warned."
3,Can I really call this Macross Plus?,"I loved the Macross Plus series every bit, but this movieversion ... me. True, there is new footage never seen before, butthis movie also cuts several scenes from the original series, itsalmost impossable to bare. The new footage is ok, but I'd like to seeit with ENTIRE Macross Plus series. Your better off paying double forthe tapes or DVDs instead of buying this. The only reason to buy thistape is if you are an extreme Macross fan and want to see everydeleted scene from the series. If your not a big Macross fan, don'teven bother buying this one."
5,Incredible,The animation is a cut of above the rest. You won't be dissapoitnted if you buy this video.
5,A landmark in animation,"One needn't been familiar with the Macross mythos to appreciate this film. The design work and animation (a smooth blend of cell and CGI work) really help this sci-fi tale to set new standards. A ""non-mushy"" love triangle between two rival fighter pilots/friends and a singer who lends her talents to a superstar computer intelligence make this a most unique experience. In the end, all I can say is ""wow."""
2,Don't do it in the name of Macross!,"I was disappointed with this movie. I didn't really find a connection, at least a real connection, with the original story. Just a 'forced relation' so as you can use the Macross (so as to sell more?) name.The movie is not bad (not good either) but they shouldn't use the Macross name.It hasn't also, have the 'soul' of the original story."
5,great value,not as easy to find as its an old method for connecting speakers. worth it just to save the soldering
2,"lightweight introduction, not for practical use","If you are looking for a lightweight introduction to embedded internet this is not a bad book.If you have plans to internet enable your javelin stamp, this is your only source.But if you plan to use TINI to do the job, you will be much better off with the book ""Designing Embedded Internet Devices"" from NewNess press (ISBN: 1878707981).The book lacks a decent introduction to the TINI development environment. Also the source code is not documented at all. There is just a bit of wrap text around each code example, not explaining what is happening in the code.And if you finally want to use the source code you will have to retype it, cause there's neither a cdrom or a website of the book available.My advice (if not interested in javelin stamp): Buy the 'other' book !"
2,Not Pleased,"My order was never even acknowledged, but at least I got a hassle free refund (pending verification on my PayPal statement)."
3,THE BEST OF MAHALIA JACKSON,"This is the best of the CD's I purchased at this time, but still a disappointment, though i will listen to it sometimes. Having a copy of Mahalia singing with the Percy Faith orchestra on the recording ""The Power and the Glory"" my husband and I were expecting something as rich and moving as the above. Definitely an inferior recording to the one we own. Sorry.Barbara Dunstan"
5,My Goodness!!!,"My Goodness this is quite a compelation!!! I thank my God for annointing this woman to sing like...like...like, well, I don't even know how to describel her. You can actualy feal what she sings. You can feal the sense of longing and expectation for rest and reward after a life filled with trial and tribulation. You can also feal the joy and serenity I'm sure she had due to the One she loved to sing about most: her life's Love, and mine: Jesus of Nazareth! This cd has wonderful sound quality and a lovely selection of some of her different modes-- from jubilee, to sorrow/longing, to almost classical-slash-jazzy! You won't be dissapointed! May she rest ever in God's peace."
5,One Mistake,"You miss the greatest cut ""Motherless Child"" and you should correct it. Undoubtably the best Gospel EVER."
4,family plot,not the best but worth the view for any real fan of Hitchcock's work. has the tongue-in-cheek comedy characteristic of his other films while stil delivering on the action and mystery
2,Out with a bang.......,"Poor ol' Hitch. He didn't go out with a bang. I was looking forward to this film so much, considering it was his last film. I thought it would be interesting to see how his style would hold up in 1976 compared to his prime of the 40's, 50's, and early 60's. Even Frenzy from 72 was a far superior film, actually one of my favorites. But I must say I was highly disappointed in this pitiful film. The only good part was the down the hill in the car scene. And Barbara Harris is pretty entertaining lady. Other than that, it was quite hideous. ""Frenzy"" should have been his last flick for sure. The question is, ""Is it a comedy or suspense?"" Well, unfortunately, neither, because it's not funny, suspenseful, or even interesting at all. No disrepect though because he is still one of the greatest directors ever....."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"""Family Plot"" was Hitchcock's last film...if this is the best he could come up with, he should have retired after ""Frenzy"" (the only decent movie the master made after ""The Birds"" in my opinion!) I am a huge fan of Hitchcock, but this was a sad and disappointing way to end an otherwise stellar career. I didn't mind the fact that the movie is a comedy (with dramatic overtones)...after all, so was ""Frenzy"" in a much darker sense, and ""The Trouble With Harry""...in fact, that characteristic Hitchcock wit permeated most of the master's work, and usually, it only added to his movies...(""Rear Window"" is a prime example)but ""Family Plot"" was just stupid, and waaaay beneath the master of suspense. With the possible exceptions of ""Marnie"" and the dreadful ""Topaz"", ""Family Plot"" was Hitchcock's worst film...but mind you, this is just one person's opinion. You might not agree...so see it for yourself...just be warned...don't expect the Hitchcock genius in this one."
1,A Waste of Film!,I wouldn't watch this movie again if my life depended on it. It was a boring movie with absolutly no suspense. It was far to predictable. This was one of Alfred's worst!
4,good movie,"Cute movie, funny, good cast of people.Love Karen Black, Bruce Dern,William Devane and Barbara Harris are wonderful.Alfred Hitchcock was never better."
3,Hitchcock's Light-Hearted Farewell,"Several veteran filmmakers ended their careers on a less-than-stellar note compared to Alfred Hitchcock. At least the Master of Suspense bowed out with a nudge and a wink in this 1976 comic thriller. ""Family Plot"" is engaging fluff bolstered by a few memorable set pieces (notably the wild car chase) and a quirky ensemble featuring Barbara Harris, Bruce Dern, Karen Black and William Devane. Far from top-flight Hitchcock, but worth seeing at least once."
5,WOW!What A Pleasant Surprise!,"You'd think a Passport album of this latter 70's vintage would be soft or weak but none of this is!The ""AtaraxiaSuite"" (based on the LP's European title)is excellent chill outfusion while catchy funky stuff like the tital cut,""Mandrake"" andthe latin-spiced ""Algeria"" lend the entire affair a warm,upbeatair.""Reng Ding Dang Dong"" and ""Loco-Motive"" achive much the sameaffect with more of an electronic Krautfunk twist while ""Secret""and ""Lousianna"" once again sunbath by softer shores even as all nine cuts flaunt the savvy and versitility of Dolinger and company's vision.A grand statement by major players."
5,Get inside a man's head!,"I have purchased several DVDs in the Loving Sex series and they never disappoint. This one is great for women who want to show their man they care enough to seduce him, rather than waiting for him to initiate all the time. Watching this is a great kick-start to getting it on. The love and sex are portrayed as beautiful and inspiring, not sordid. The couples are attractive and it's good viewing for both men and women - the explicit sex scenes are pretty hot and there are informative extra features worth checking out."
1,Junk,Sprayer did not work from day one. The plastic on the top of the tank lid was unevenly machined and would not hold a seal. Air leaked out constantly and you had to pump the unit every ten seconds to hold any pressure. I returned it and Amazon refunded my money.
1,remarkably boring,"This is the worst book I have ever read, period! I understand what the writer was trying to do but he failed miserably. You can literally read the beginning sentence of each paragraph and skip the rest. You can read the first chapter and last chapter and be 100% fulfilled witht he story. The writing style is something you would see out of an 8th grader. ""the man from the 3rd floor opened the door. the door was brown and big. The kind of door that opens and closes. A door with hinges and a knob. The man walks through. Slowly. As slow as a turtle in slow motion. The man closes the door. The door that is brown and can open and close."" The End.Pathetic!"
2,Slight of Hand,"Tricks don't make for good reading. I agree the guy's a poet -- he paints pictures like nobody else -- but every character seems sweaty, half-naked, and unemployed. If I wanted that, I'd walk through my own neighborhood. What I wanted was a story, but what I got was little Jimmy Joyce in a circle jerk with his MFA buddies."
3,Middle Class and Middle of the Road,"McGregor's novel is a reaction against gritty urban novels that deal with poverty, and also against the types of people who thought Princess Diana's death was a big deal. As such, the novel angles itself with relentless focus on the immersive detail of middle-class suburban lives. This attempt to reclaim the ordinary has to start with a normative judgement about what ordinary is. The people in this novel aren't any more ordinary than anyone else: they simply occupy a normative band of middle-class experience which exempts them from the cultural hysteria that McGregor assigns to the working classes.It comes complete with some assertions about the purity and nobility of the artist figure; characters with no obvious motivations or desires; and sentimental depictions of childhood, marriage and old age.It's occasionally a very beautiful novel but consistently a self-important one."
3,Not the best shape....but my child loved it!,"It was definately used. But the sender packaged it very nice. I am glad I got it, the price was right."
4,"Great shoes, but run small","I love Spira shoes, and have had two pairs of their walking shoes. These are good athletic shoes, but not quite as fabulous as the leather walking shoe. For some reason they are not quite as springy and bouncy, although they are still better than most athletic shoes. Also,for some reason they seem to run small. I wear a size 9 in the Spira leather walking shoe, but had to order a 9 1/2 in these. Otherwise, I am satisfied with these shoes, but also feel that they may be a bit overpriced."
2,A very comprehensive but poorly organized book,"The book includes almost everything but is very poor in organization. Some of the topics (which should appear in one chapter or one section) are scattered in different places. This makes the readers difficult to get the macro view of econometrics.Also, there are many printing errors in the Prentice Hall International edition, although some of the amendments can be found in the author's web site.LAW Ka Chung"
2,A teacher's reference book,"A teacher's reference book, that's all it is. A good reference book, but nonetheless of little pedagogycal importance for the student of econometrics."
2,Difficult even at the PhD Level,"Greene covers all of the major aspects of econometrics, but often makes the topics more difficult than is necessary. This book is definitely not for beginners; it is difficult even at the PhD level. Greene is a good choice for someone who already has in-depth knowledge of this topic"
3,"Now, it has a competitor","Greene is NOT a very good book. However it not a bad one either.It is only a comprehensive book on Econometrics, more suitable for applied economists for a quick review.I do not like the author's style of presenting the proof before the theorem. This makes it difficult and confusing to follow.Before buying it, the customer should take a look at a more recent, well organized, great competitor, and better book both for practitioners and a more theoretical econometrists:Ruud, Arthur. An Introduction to Classical Econometric Theory."
2,A reference book....that's it,This is a book for advanced graduate student... It's really not concrete.....Johnston-Dinardio do a much better job as giving the intuitution to the student
5,Oh-ee-ay! Oh-ee-oh!,"Who doesn't love this show with its lovable characters, exotic locations, and swashbuckling excitment! Hand drawn cartoons are almost completely extinct thanks to computer animation, so I'm glad they decided to release the Disney Afternoon lineup. I am 28 years old, but I will never forget rushing home after school to watch Talespin, Ducktales, Rescue Rangers, and Gummibears."
4,"TaleSpin, Volume 1",i rember watching this when i grew up in the 90s. it was funny. i like the funny jungle book characters.
5,TaleSpin,This show entertains kids of all ages. I grew up on this show and now I put it in for my kids and they love it.
5,Rene Goscinny's Characters are Back!,"This film is the second Asterix film to be dubbed by Disney. I don't know who plays Asterix in the film, But it sounds like Rip Taylor (Ducktales Movie, The Genie). Really Great Buy Now!"
5,Great Reference,"I'm not going to be too verbose here, but I've used this text for three years now, and it's an excellent reference for basic pathophysiology. I've used it at both the undergraduate and medical school level, and I've been very pleased with both the organization and the content. It's not a replacement for Robbins Pathology, but it's an excellent supplement, and somewhat easier to read/use."
5,IMATION GOOD?,"SO FAR HAVE RECORDED SIX DISCS WITHOUT A HITCH. THE SOUND COMES WITH GOOD DEPTH. IF YOU LOVE BURNING MUSIC, YOU'LL LOVE THESE.THE DISCS HAS PLAYED IN EVERYTHING I'VE TRIED SO FAR."
4,High on Adventure,"Expect fun from Spy Kids, because it's like a more than average James Bond movie. Only in this movie, they're kids. 2 Kids must rescue their spy parents.. and uncover obstacles along the way. The cinematography was nice, the action scenes were eye-opening, and this is a nice escape for about 2 hours. For an awesome adventure movie, get Spy Kids. My only complaint is that the DVD has no features. Still a great buy."
