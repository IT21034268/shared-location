4,very exciting adventure,Into The wild is a book of great adventure. Following Alex's every step is indeed hard to do with all his moving and all. I really enjoyed this book because it is something that does go on in the world today. Having the book starting out with finding Alex dead and all really gets the flow of the story of how it all happened. Every few chapters the author decided to go back to the specific scene were they found the old bus and Alex in it. The reason for this I believe is to make the reader think about the stories were Alex has traveled and what he has been through which brings the reader's thought and imagination back to the tragic scene were Alex was found dead. I am glad that I had the chance to read this book because this book has been one of the best books that I have read.
5,A book you need to read,"I choose the book INTO THE WILD from a list of books that was given to me by my professor. The reason that I choose this book is because I really enjoyed the summery right away it allowed me to get a little taste of the book which made me want to read the book. The book his full of a lot of action, suspense, stupidity, intelligence, and a big heart by the main charcter Chris McCandless. It takes you through the ups and downs of his journey and leaves you wondering why. This is a really good book it's based on a true story and I really recommend it to all students and adults if you are interested in non-fiction. (National Bestseller)"
4,"Complicated, Idealistic and Intense","This is a really good book. This is the type of book that whenever I read a page or a section I want to keep going more and more each time to find out what happens next. Unlike other books that are the same type, that make me want to keep going, whenever I do go on reading nothing interesting happens. When I was half way through the book I realized that this wasn't really a survival book which was what I was hoping for, so I was somewhat disappointed but it is still a really good book. Krakauer, the author, instead of writing an adventurous Alive or Cliffhanger type book he decided to tell a story about the inner-self of a complicated, idealistic and intense young man. Even though the book wasn't really about survival or the point wasn't whether the guy died or not I really didn't like the fact that when I started to read I already knew that they guy dies in the first couple of chapters."
4,An Inspirational Story,"Christopher McCandless was an individual. He gave up a lifestyle of luxery and ease and replaced it with his own. He lived for the moment and nothing else. Chris was spontaneous in his decisions. As soon as he could think of something exciting to do, he would do it. He never considered the consequences of his actions. Something we all consider foolish but all dream of doing. Chris traveled the nation, meeting people and depending solely on his wits to help him get by. I think that everyone who has ever felt like societies standards have gotten to high should read this book. This is a story about life on the edge, something we all admire."
2,How does a book like this become a best-seller?,"I did not like the book. I read it once, and the first time I read it, I only got half-way through it because it didn't seem to grab my attention. I like the wilderness, however, the idea of some rich kid, giving all his possesions away and hiking out in Alaska till he dies, does not thrill me. Krakauer told more about himself then the main character fo the book. I mean it is an interesting story, but not something I could picture a lot of people trying in real life. A kid is rich, hates his family and decides to give it all up to go die in Alaska, no I don't think so. Maybe next time Jon."
4,"A good scenario of the old ""man vs. nature"" theme","A fine, although depressing, book about a very idealistic young man who ventures up to live in the wilds of Alaska, without any companions, food, equipment. A good scenario of the old ""man vs. nature"" theme. Also, if you missed reading Tino Georgiou's masterpiece--The Fates, go and read it. I'm reading it at a rapid pace because it's so addictive. There is something about his books that bring you in and get you hooked. and I'm loving this one. Highly Recommend!"
4,An interesting approach of adventurers psychology through this tragic story,"Krakauer, with his experience of extreme adventures and good understanding of psychology, has done an excellent work of investigation.Methodically, he allows the reader to better understand this tragic story, clearing alongside McCandless of foolishness and irresponsibility suspicions. He highlights the intelligence and deep determination of an unusual person.This story just keep triggering questions like ""would the kid have been able to clear his psychological issues and find way to better accept of life if he didn't have such conjunction of bad luck?"".He finally teaches us a lesson of understanding and humility. A must read for every parent willing to understand what goes through the mind of a teenager or just to remember one's own youth..."
4,loved this book!,"I just want to say that I loved this book. I respected Chris for sticking with his beliefs. He took this journey to find something real. It was the only thing that would make him whole. I think he knew he would not make it out, and I think he was okay with that. He was too smart to not know that what he went into the wild with was enough to survive. I think he felt that when supplies ran out...he would live only as long as his life was supposed to be. I admired him for being so true to himself. I also think Chris died feeling he accomplished what he needed to do. I don't think he would have been happy living a long life in a fairy tale world of ""things."" He died being true to himself. How many people can honestly say they accomplished that in a lifetime? You have to respect him."
3,Why no pics?,"I have a profound admiration for Chris, the soul of this work, but why only one pic of him? Why didn't the author take pain to obtain more pictures of him, be it childhood, whatever, like most biographers would do? The big picture of the author back in the paperback I could care less. Why not focus more on the subject instead of the author? It ruins the mood for me. It's supposed to be a comtemplative theme, Chris' life. Why not show, instead of words?"
4,Insights into restless spirits,"This is an interesting and well-written book about a young man from a privileged background who felt compelled to live in the wild as much as possible. I found McCandless an interesting character, but the parts of the book that I remember most are Krakauer's two chapters on his own wanderlust This led him to his own adventure that could have taken his life in the same way that McCandless' took his.Krakauer and McCandless both went through more extreme versions of this wanderlust than most people, but many of us feel it more weakly. His insights into this part of the human condition make the book."
3,good collaboration of Jon's and Chris McCandless's adventure,"The book turned out to be interesting and left me wondering what really happened to Chris...Krakauer respected the life of Chris and honored his memory, but still provided the reasons native Alaskans thought Chris died. If you are looking for a similar read to Into Thin Air this isn't it...but good nonetheless."
4,Henceforth Will Learn,"I remember when this book came out and I always wanted to read it. When the movie came out I resolved myself to not see the movie until I read the book. I'm glad I did.It's a book that hits you on many levels. I found myself disliking Chris McCandless towards the beginning but as I read further, I found myself understanding him a little better. By the time I put the book down I'll admit I was really heartbroken by his story but happy that he found what made him happy. It's a shame he died finding it. It was a very inspiring and touching story that I'm sure I'll want to read again, just not that soon. I took a little something for myself from his story and what more can you ask for.Just a simple thank you to the family of Chris McCandless for sharing his story as well as to Jon Krakauer for telling it."
4,lonely [and unfair] search for innerself,"it's been a couple of months i saw the movie 'into the wild'. at first, it has really touched me and i got fascinated with young irresponsible runway-from-everything-and-everyone chris macandless. as soon as i could i bought the book which i just finished. while reading it, i had the opportunity of learning the cruelty of a young mand who just woke up one day and found out that he simply didn't fitted into any place. albeit i'm still enchanted with 'alex', it should be remembered the suffering he imposed to his parents and, most of all, to his sister, who seemed to be the best proof alex could get of the very existence of all he tried to reach and to prove. who's right? maybe alaska.. but the story is great indeed.andr√© g, Brazil"
3,NOT ENOUGH SUBSTANCE,WHAT A WASTE OF LIVE AND HURT TO THE ONES LEFT BEHIND.TO GO INTO NOWHERE WITH NOTHING TO SURVIVE WITH...NO REAL REASON FOR THE EFFORT TO GO ON HIS OWN IS EVER FIGURED OUT.LEAVES YOU GOING..WHY???SAD AND DISTURBING.I EXPECT THE MOVIE WIL BE MUCH CHANGED AND ADDED TO ALSO TO MAKE IT WORTH WATCHING..BUT WILL IT BE TRUE TO THE PERSON?
1,"Poorly written, and not interesting","This book is nothing but a sloppy, unorganized string of quotes, journal entries, and other meaningless crap. Chris McCandless's life is uninteresting, and his ""wild adventure"" to Alaska is nothing but a feeble suicide mission. He was ill-prepared, and I believe he suffered from a mental illness. He is not a ""hero"", or a ""soul-seeker"", but more of a dopey kid who decided to plunge into the wild with not much more than a ten lb bag of rice. What a moron...."
1,This kid was just plain stupid,"Sorry folks, why are you trying to sentimentalize a young, rebellious kid who was hiked into the Alaskan woods without enough planning or provisions? That's not brave or adventuresome in my book. Where I come from that's just plain stupid. I'm still at a loss as to why Sean Penn made a movie about this dumb kid. Now don't get me wrong, I'm truly sorry for the loss of his life, and my heart goes out to his parents. But for God's sake, he did a stupid, dumb act in the name of getting back to nature. There's nothing more to it than that."
4,I read his college editorials and met him.,Chris McCandless was the lead editor for the Emory Wheel and graduated a few years after me. I would occasionally go back on campus and pickup the Emory Wheel and read away. What struck me about Chris' articles was his stark alienation on any position. I had a gnawing feeling that this person was severely unbalanced. He wrote with a sort of libertarian anger fused with his personal diatribes (he hated most all of Reagan policies...i.e star wars- and at the same time all the polar opposites.) It was gut wrenching to read and to this day I do not understand why someone could not have seen it. Sad story but a well written book.
2,About as smart as hunting at night.,Not much Maria Ford. She does some kind of accent which is cute.They shake the camera every time theres a fight. Should have had a lot more Maria. For those who don't know Maria ford might have the best legs in the world.
2,Beware!!!,"My face has never been the same since using this. I mean, I have gotten the texture back to normal, but oh my! After using this product thicker hair began to grow on my chin. So, even though I have never ever had to do this before, I now have to pluck these thick hairs out of my chin. Who wants their boyfriend to feel a beard on their face. Also, it didn't clear up anything, it just made my skin irritable. Buyer beware!!"
3,Don't make this your only recording of the Brandenburgs!,"This is a fantastic recording. But while Musica Antiqua Koln's technical skill outmodes that of nearly any other ensemble I've heard, Goebel's exaggerated tempi occasionally force these beautiful pieces to border on the non-musical. Yes, it's impressive to hear Brandenburgs 3 and 6 performed at lightning speeds, but simply playing ""fast"" doesn't necessarily mean ""exciting"" or even ""listenable."" Occasionally it's like speed-reading poetry. Having more than 10 sets of Brandenburgs in my collection, I'd certainly place this set in the upper half, but there are many other interpretations that allow the intricacies of these pieces to shine, rather than the virtuosity of the group performing them."
4,This Book is a Great Help,The layout of this book is very simple and easy to use/understand. It can be used as a quick reference or as a study book. The author gives relevant information and great examples.
1,Jersey,I purchased this jersey and it began to fall apart after only 2-3 washes. The white numerals were what came off.
5,A magnificant life in medicine,"With great writing skill and a deep understanding of his subject, Dr. Rapport has managed to capture the essence of the life of one of the most influential doctors of the age. At the same time, the book describes many of the major clinical developments in medicine over the past one hundred years. A fine book that will interest not only doctors, but their patients as well."
3,"Good idea, but easily obsolete almost immediately","Stern's popularity more than justifies such a volume, but most of the sites contained within the tome are either no longer linked or made up of address strings so long as to be ungainly. It's a great idea for a book, but would have made a better website. Also lacks a lot of background of the show that other books have in spades.For fans, but few others."
2,Let Down,I was very excited to buy this product. When it came I ran water through it and it worked great. The seal on the liquid storage is not built into the lid. I do not know why. Maybe for cleaning reasons? The seal never felt right. I filled the device with whiskey and coke for the golf course and drove to the course. When I went to retrieve the device from my trunk I realized it had leaked everywhere. Nothing like a suv wreaking of Jim Beam. Basically I had great expectations but was let down by the seal.
4,Book Summary (Plot),"Hi. Not sure if completely okay, but I'll put a re-creation of the plot summary as given in the book:""Who would want to persecute a girl like Lucia Ruyter? At the bank her warm friendliness and easy efficiency made her a pleasure to work with; her neighbors all spoke of her with affection, and the men in her life knew her to be a delightful and attractive young woman.But Lucia had suddenly become the subject of a series of pointedly obscene, anonymous letters. And it was only a matter of time before Postal Inspector David Madden realized that although he could save Lucia's reputation he might not be able to save her life.Scene: Connecticut.""Hope that helps a little bit. Other than that, it's a good read, as are all of her works."
1,Wrong book,"For some weird reason, instead of Algebra by P. M. Cohn (a very good graduate text on abstract algebra) I get some Middle school book on algebra by Dolciani, Wooton, and Beckenbach... Mistery...."
5,Excellent Drama,"I saw the previews of this movie on television several years ago. I have been hunting it for several years because I couldn't remember the title. After I saw the movie, I knew the previews did it justice. This is aa great movie for anyone who likes drama."
4,Good story,"It's the story of a professional killer and a journalist who became close, and the end is great."
4,Unusual plot!,"The movie has a very unusual plot, although this plot is maybe not always believable. But the main attraction here is James Woods playing a villain. Brian Dennehy, his partner, is also up to the task, but he is here the same as he was in many other movies - tough guy. James Woods performance really makes you to forget some weaknesses in the plot and not to pay much attention to bad acting by other actors. Overal, great treat for James Woods fans and good enough thriller."
4,A little gem,"This cracking little thriller features two of Hollywoods most underated actors. James Woods always the 2nd string to better known actors, and Brian Dennehy who is now an award winning stage actor on Broadway.Without these two actors and the chemistry that develops between them the film wouldn't have worked. Its an interesting story that keeps you guessing where its going (unless you've seen it as many times as I have). The direction by John Flynn is straightforward, and the script by Larry Cohen is pretty sharp. There are a few memorable scenes that will stick with you, and I would say its one of the few films I've seen where it could have been 15 minutes longer.Woods plays the villian in the film, with Dennehy playing the cop who is now a successful novelist. Something in their past links them together and Woods wants Dennehy to write about it!If you've managed to miss this film over the last 20 years, its well worth buying, as I have found it certainly holds up to repeated viewings."
5,A beautiful story,"This is the most beautiful story of a girl and her grandfather. I read this to my kindergarten class. I had tears streaming down my face before I finished. It is a touching, heartfelt book and I highly recommend it!"
4,Still good,"This is the third of Nick Park's incredible Wallace and Gromit series. It's certainly the most complex. There are lots more characters (including one with a speaking part), lots more cartoony gadgetry, and a great chase scence. That involves a truck, motorcycle, airplane, and flock of sheep - good stuff.For all that, ""A Close Shave"" really isn't my favorite in the W&G; trilogy. The love interest was a bit forced, for one thing, and the plot had a slightly serious tone that just didn't work for me the way the other W&G; movies did. Well, I can't blame him for trying.""A Close Shave"" is a worthy companion to Park's other W&G; stories. It's kid-safe, with no real violence or adult themes, but still holds an adult's attentio. My attention, at least. Enjoy!//wiredweird"
5,Family entertainment like it used to be!,"Good clean entertainment that does not rely on double entendres to keep the adults entertained.This really is entertaining for all ages, and that is a great achievement.The characters are cute without being sickly sweet and the story is well paced and heartwarming.This video sold a million toys and boosted sales of cheese (!). Give it a go - you will not be disappointed."
2,take a walk on the wild side.,"I bought this set last week.Ordinarily these concertos rate highly, but no.5 is very weak : the soloist is recessed, and I can hardly hear her, e.g. the orchestra plays from New Hampshire, but she is in New Jersey.(Having a weak item in a CD is like reading a weak paragraph in a novel.)Instead, buy the set which is led by Reinhardt Goebel on Archiv.I like his tempos, which some consider eccentric, but the quicker bowings suit the melodic sequences."
3,Caution - Live Recording,"We are returning this CD because it is a live recording, not mentioned in the above review. It was voted Best Opera Recording by Gramophone, 1991, and if you don't mind live recordings, give it a try."
4,what a review should be,I have much less to say about the opera than the review submitted by Tom Han from Texas. I think it's an outstanding exemplar of what an Amazon review should be. Keep up the excellent work!
2,Could be better,"I purchased this product to help control the dust and shavings generated by my 12"" planer. The dust collector did help but it fills up quickly and then the dust overflows the top and bottom and becomes ineffective. While browsing the products on this page I saw a dust collector with the outlet in the center of the collector instead of the side. I am hoping it will fit the 12 inch planer because I believe a center outlet will be much more effective than the side outlet."
1,barely worth the cost,"My small shop was a mess after even minimal planing with my Delta 12"" planer. I thought the Delta dust hood attachement would help. It does but just barely.First off the damn thing didn't fit. It had been twisted while being welded up, so it took me a day to make it fit passably. The hood fills up with shavings at the end farthest from the vacuum attachement after just a few planings; this easily cleaned out by inserting a shop-vac attachement, but this takes time. It's better than nothing, but just barely."
2,Bad Fit for the price,Sheet metal had to be rebent into the proper position to get it to fit. About a 45 minute job.
3,Mediocre product,"I agree with some of the other reviewers--the thing just doesn't fit very well. Not all the holes line up so you really have to twist it in order to get the screws in. Once assembled, it works OK. I have a 2 hp collector, so nothing ever clogs, but it still only gets about 80% of the chips, so that leaves 20% all over the place that you still have to clean up. That said, you really don't have any other choice (except make your own), and over the life of the tool, it will save you a lot of sweeping. It's just that it would have been so easy to make it better..."
3,It Works...,"Looks like an adaptation of a standard HVAC fitting, not particularly sturdy. If you don't have a dust collection system, the rubber reducing collars for a septic system (Hardware Store) can reduce the 4"" Collar to a 2 1/2"" Shop Vac hose, it makes a nice snug connection. The weight of any hose makes one end of the hood droop and sometimes catches the stock as it passes...need to watch that, but it does a good job of removing shavings and eliminating mess, even with with only a shop vac for collection."
1,A book full of lies,"I shared the same feeling when I read the bood, but when I went to Tibet by chance, I found so many lies in book. Tibet is a nice place, and most local people there regard Tibet as a China's province. Those people want Tibet's independence are just a small population, and creating all kinds of lies to get sympathies from all over the world."
1,the game is great the contoller on the other hand,this isnt good and im right cause i said SOOOOOOOOOO
1,deserves negative stars,This is beyond question the WORST printer I have ever owned.I cannot print a simple job over two pages to completion. Itjams and cannot feed paper correctly. I have jumped throughevery hoop conceivable and nothing resembling a decent outputover two pages...V Brown
4,Adventure for Younger Readers,"This book, obviously written for readers who are beginning to delve into longer, chapter books, is a good adventure tale full of action and mystery alike. The writing is simple yet engaging, and the reader can easily identify with either William or Sarah, the main characters, and experience the dangers and ultimate success along side them."
3,Fragil control set,"The RC car performance and speed is more than adeacuate, but the control set is prompt to breakage. It is poorly builded. I do not recommended this product because of it."
3,"Remote control car, ok, but not durable","The Remote control car looks cool and is pretty fast, but not for smaller children. I bought it for Christmas for my 4 yr old,, and the 1st time he used it the front bumper and undercarriage got broken, and within a week the siderear view mirrors got broken off. And the battery is a pain to take in and out, have to unscrew two screws to get off the battery panel."
4,a great gift for a son-in-law,"I bought this for my son-in law for no real reason ""just because"". I love my son-in-law and I thought this might be fun for down time. I didn't want something cheap, but I didn't have $300 for the car I would have loved to have bought him. He likes it. I am happy!"
1,Beautiful design with a fatal flaw,"This otherwise beautiful wall lamp was not properly thought through in terms of design. If you check the product shot, that is exactly what you get. The metal housing the cord extends down from is about six inches long. That means, once you mount the lamp on the wall at a normal height above a chair or sofa, you have an unsightly cord hanging down from the wall to the floor. Nor can you buy some decorative tubing to cover the cord up, because the light switch is attached to it. So if you think having a lamp cord hanging down from your living room wall is aesthetically pleasing, this lamp is worth considering. If you think lamp cords are ugly and best left out of sight, pass this lamp by."
1,Did not last.,This lasted about three months and then died after little use. It is not a quality product. I would not recommend it.
3,HAND VACUUM,It is ok...Not outstanding..Not very strong suction..I am not really impressed with it and feel it was a waste of my money...
2,Not impressive,"The unit makes a lot of noise, but doesn't seem to be very effective in getting out the dust around the keys. It does pick up dust particles in open exposed areas, but then again, I can clean them up with a cloth."
1,No suction at all!,This little guy can't even pick up crums from the center console. It's good for sucking up dust and that's about it. A complete waste of money.
1,NO SUCTION. Worst hand vac ever!,"I was so excited to see this vacuum in Bed Bath & Beyond. With its nice looks and small size appeared to be the premium car vac that I was looking for. I bought it thinking that I could use it to keep my car looking nice all the time. First hurdle... why wouldn't a vacuum intended for the car use a DC outlet?? So much for keeping it handy in the car... Second... NO SUCTION. I mean NONE. This little vac doesn't even pull enough to pick up dust. I know. I tried it. The brush attachment gives the illusion that it's doing something. But, for all the noise, the vacuum wasn't sucking anything. I threw it away after my first use. This is the most pitiful excuse for a vacuum that I have ever used!"
1,Not up to the job,"I bought this to clean dust and debris from my keyboard, monitor, and surrounding area. After charging it the full 24 hours, I tried it a couple of times and was very disappointed. The suction was so weak that it would not pick up small bits of debris in the keyboard. The brush attachment was very small, making it a tedious job to dust the monitor screen. Also, the switch is just a push button that you have to hold down to keep the unit on. Because the packaging has to be destroyed to get it open, I did not return the vacuum. I will donate it to charity. I do not recommend this vacuum, even for small cleaning jobs."
1,Returned,"I looked all over for a little vacuum to use on my computer and similar small jobs, after reading the reviews I decided to take a chance on this one. Mistake. Not only does this thing not pick up even the lightest of objects, it only holds a charge for maybe 5 minutes. And the longer you (try to) use it the faster the suction gets weak and it begins to lose power. I got my money back."
1,Weak,The suction provided by this vacuum is ill fitted to all but the most infinitesimally light particles around the house and even that may be wishful thinking.
3,Mini Vaccum and too mini,Although it works well to remove dust well. because of the small size you have to spend lot of time to clean whole interior of your car. I never used it for long and so cannot comment on battery life.
2,Not strong enough for bugs,"Very little suction, but I was hoping to use it to capture stinkbugs, not crumbs on the keyboard. Sleek and attractive and probably would work for crumbs."
3,Depends on what you use it for,"I've had this for couple of years and it's still going. I got it as a gift and i find that it's suction power is too weak and the coverage of suction is too small. It's like why bother trying to nitpick items off keyboard when it's jst easier to turn it over and shake it out outside. However, I have found one great use for this minvac. Throughout the years, i found that trying to kill ants or bugs in the house can get messy and leave stains and u have to clean it afterwards sometimes. The vac has enough suction power to pickup ants and other bugs and they get trapped and eventually die in the vac. No mess. So far the internal rechargeable battery is still going strong and i've had good many years of use out of it for bug sucking.It's about the only purpose, but usefull one, that I could find to use this tiny vac."
4,Worth it,It's what I expected. It does a good job on the keyboard and screen which is why I got it. You're not going to be cleaning your whole house with this but I have no regrets.
2,Charger Didn't Work,"I think this could be a very handy tool if it worked properly for me. I bought this item and didn't open it for a few months because I forgot about it. When I found it and decided to use it, I plugged in the charger and put the vacuum on the base. The light did not light up. The charger did not work and I'm left with a useless tool because I can't charge it."
5,Great Little Keyboard Vac,"With 8 cats and a dog, you can imagine that fur is a constant problem. I was looking for a mini vacuum to clean laptop keyboards and screens and this little machine works perfectly. It does exactly what the description said it would do, clean keyboards and electronic devices. It isn't going to clean your carpet or suck the dust bunnies from under the bed, but it does a nice job on cat hair and cracker crumbs on my keyboard. In addition, the little brush does a good job loosening dust so the vac can grab it."
2,"Not Very Effective, Poor QC","As advertised, small - in effectiveness. Relatively weak suction, the power button stuck ""on"" when we first used it and frequently thereafter. Seems to be a poor engineering design, accompanied by poor construction and even worse QC. No narrow attachment for getting into small crevices, which could make the suction more effective. Pay attention to the reviews, boys & girls - this is a light (very) duty appliance, suitable for picking up loose dust from your desk top, noisely and with some effort (which could be cleaned with a wipe from a dust cloth), which likely won't last very long."
5,vac,great for a computer desk area but my previous one wore out after a year so just ordered another one.
3,Does the Job.,"First off, I'd say - read the dimensions before you buy this product! I thought I was buying a full sized dustbuster, so when it came in the mail, my husband and I just LAUGHED. It's very small, but for small spaces, it does get the job done. Not tons of power, but enough for picking up crumbs or small jobs like that."
3,Less Power Than Thought,"The hand vac was shipped and received on time and appeared to be built OK but, the suction power was even less than I had anticipated. I realize it is cordless etc., but did not meet my needs. That's why it was rated as I did!!!!"
4,Size does matter!!,"This portable hand vac worked quite well considering I had my doubts about it capabilities. I started off by using it on smaller, light pieces such as cat fur and small dust bunnies. It worked like a charm. Then it was onto medium sized and moderately heavier pieces like food crumbs (due to eating crackers and pretzels in bed). My bed was more comfortable that evening. Finally I tested it on pieces of glass, (after accidently dropping one on the floor). Well, I must say that this ""little devil"" really pulled (sucked) it's own weight !! I'm so pleased with it that I'm buying another to keep in my car. The only con that this product has is its built-in dust cup which needs emptying frequently enough for it to be somewhat of a nuisance. All in all, I say it's worth its value. Heck, I've spent my money on worst things!! I like this product very much and have told my friends and family about it."
3,Good for electronics,"I bought this for cleaning my electronic products since regular vacuums can damage equipment. It does it's job for removing dust from my laptop, though that's all it's good for. Don't expect this to pick up anything else other than small crumbs and dust. I would've given this a 4 star, but I have one gripe, that is charging this unit as you don't know for sure when the charge is complete (I left this to charge for over a day and the red light was still on). This is only recommended for cleaning laptops, computers and any other equipment that collects dust."
2,Almost Worthless,the only pro with this vac is that it is handy and cordless.It does pick up small dust bunnies ok but anything heavierand you are out of luck. Very low suction. I think this isdue to the filter.Keep looking.
3,Handle with care,"It worked well enough. However, if you drop it, it will self-destruct with no possible hope for reassambly."
3,This product is smaller than its name.,"I'm not entirely sure what this is meant to pick up (it was a gift), but I've been using it to vacuum areas of about a square foot that are covered with so much dust the carpet is visibly grey--the lovely surprises you find when moving furniture. It picks it up pretty well, and fits neatly into the charger. It's fairly comfortable in the hand; the only aspect of this product that's displeasing is that the storage space is somewhat awkward. You take part of it off, and then you have to scrape the dust off the outside of a bag made of the material of hospital scrubs. It's kind of strange. This is a pretty good product though.P.S. I'm not under 13, but I didn't feel like making an account. (I am a minor; my dad puts in my orders from amazon with his own.)"
2,Poor suction and overall weak performance...,"I've been using this cordless mini hand vac for a few months and find it to be totally useless.1. I found it way smaller than expected. The product looks larger on screen so be sure to check on it's dimensions and envision that in your mind before buying it.2. There's hardly enough suction to get in anything larger than a few millimeters; and I'm not talking about items that are heavy. It gives you a hard time even with tiny morsels of food.3. Not too effective on dust. It will take for ever to clean a small area.4. You don't have an on/of switch. So your finger needs to be on it for the time you intend to use it.Overall, it's not worth it. Invest in something that has more power and suction to it."
4,love it.,"i love it. i bought it to get all the dust bunnies out of computer towers since people seem to leave them so dusty. my can of air and this little mini vac work together to provide a dust free environment :) the only downside is having to empty out the little canister after every use, but it's worth it to relieve my sinuses of all the dust."
3,Detailer Cordless Hand VAC,Nice size hand vac that can reach tight spaces but doesn't appear or feel like it has much suction. I wnated it for things like vaccuming the keyboards on computer but again not much suction.
2,Dirt Devil Detailer is just medicore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I got really excited when I first saw in Dirt Devil in the store..It was exactly what I was looking for to clean my keyboard.What a perfect invention and size I thought.Well how wrong I was.while this gadget isnt completely useless I find the it doesnt suck up much dirt or dust.No matter how much I charge it i find the sucker isnt strong enough and you get a better result from just using a cloth to clean your keyboard.lucky I found the Dirt Devil Detailer on sale for 15 dollars therefore Im not really crying over it.I suggest they improve their product greatly.
5,More info would of helped!!,"Mind you I was looking for a normal sized hand-held vacuum. What I ended up with is a ruler length (12 inch obviously) vacuum. The dirt compartment is hardly a cup's full, so not very ideal for regular cleaning- which is what i wanted it for. Only get this for small jobs- office, car...Charges fast and wireless. So if not for my own personal mistake of not looking for product specifics and size details, (after looking back- there WERE NO real size references. Just a nozzle size. Nothing about length- *tiny). This is ideal for on-the-go reasons."
2,This vac doesn't do much,"This little vac's performance is questionable. It simply does not have very much suction. It's designed for tiny tasks and marketed as a ""detailer"". The tasks need to consist of lifting a few light-weight morsels. It won't pull anything off of anything and it must be extremely close to the action. I put my finger on the tip while it's running and I can just barely feel any suction."
4,Decent little vacuum for the price,I bought this vacuum to help suck up the little bit of dust I've found on a bunch of old slides I needed to scan in. Works great on a full charge.
1,Waste of money,"I may have gotten a bad unit, but this thing won't pick up a bread crumb. Highly disapointed, it's cheaply made and won't even get stuff out of a keyboard, much less pick up anything substantial."
2,Weak in power,"We use this just for cleaning our computer fans of lint once a month. They don't need heavy suction power, as that might cause problems jarring other computer parts. I would like to get a slightly more powerful cordless vac just for around the house. There are some I will investigate. But for the computer, we think this works just fine."
5,Trouble for Brother Eadulf,"Peter Tremayne is the fiction pseudonym of a well-known authority on the ancient Celts, who has utilised his knowledge of the Brehon law system and 7th-Century Irish society to create a new concept in detective fiction.The Sister Fidelma novels are taking on almost cult proportions and are becoming ever more popular with each offering from the author, whose obvious knowledge of the times and subjects he writes about shines out like a beacon on the shore.Arriving home from a voyage of pilgrimage, Sister Fidelma is shocked to hear that her Saxon companion, Brother Eadulf, a man who has assisted Fidelma on more than one occasion on her search for the truth, is under sentence of death for the murder of a young woman.Fidelma finds it impossible to even contemplate the accusation and rushes the the capital of Laigin, determined to appeal against the sentence and to do everything in her power to defend the honour and the life of Eadulf."
5,Replacement Blades,Very satisfied with transaction. Item is standard for my planer therefore price is only comparison for consideration. Very happy with price I paid.
4,Blades seem ok,"I used one side of the blades to plane pine wood. The boards were 4 in. wide, about 1/2 inch thick and approx. 6 ft long. I planes them down to about 3/8 in. I did about 8 pieces. All went well but one board had many knots in it and it chipped the blade. Seems great for wood with few knots in it."
3,Sized by whos child?,"My issue with this was the size. Right on the package it says 5+, however even after installing the smaller padding it's still too small for my three year old (37 month). Returning it. I know my sons head is big, however he fits child sized hats fine but this child sized helmet is too small. The product itself is nice, I just wonder about the size thing."
5,perfect transaction,amazing transaction I loved the hardshell helmet it is perfect and just what was advertised and the product arrived in perfect condition
1,Can not get it to work,"Bought this thing and comes with no instructions, one battery and took a long time to figure out how to install new battery, the old battery was dead. It crackles and snaps and I can hear amplified sounds about 10% of the time, otherwise just crackling sounds. Just wasted $5.00"
1,Disappointed,I bought this saw after using the 36-080 model for years (which was discontinued). I don't think that the saw has enough power. The main problem that I have is that the saw does not make a nice smooth cut through molding. It leaves blade marks on the edges - even with new blades. One nice thing is the light weight which makes the saw easy to carry around.
3,Compound Mitre Saw is better!,"For 50 or so more dollars, you could not only buy yourself a compound mitre, that Bevels 45 left AND right, with the ability to bevel to 48, allowing the user to flip the saw, not the work. It is a lot easier to swing the saw head in a different direction than it is an 18 foot piece of fragile molding!"
3,Basic Tool in a Class with Others that are Better,"A person would buy this saw only because it is cheap. There are better engineered saws (Hitachi), more accurate and bigger cut (DeWalt) and saws that are similar but not that much different in price from a bunch of vendors. This is a beat-it-til-it-dies contractor saw for meat and potatos cuts on crown and studs. Buy it if you like to beat your tools or if you want only very basic functions with 90 degree capabilities on 4x4."
5,VERY ENTERTAINING,"What a wonderful look at the inside of the Vatican. If you cannot travel to Rome to see the Vatican, this DVD will give you a wonderful glimpse into some of what is available."
4,Apersonal favourite,"I first saw this movie twenty years ago and loved it. It is my own personal cult movie and I must have seen it now at least twenty times. It is quirky, funny and I hope that if you buy it you will enjoy it as much as I have. If ever I feel slighty down, watching it is quaranteed to cheer me up."
4,One of the best road movies,"A very New Zealand film. Typically understated, low budget, quietly hilarious and with no respect for authority figures. You will want to own your own yellow mini after this. The actor who played the scrawny one, Blondini, is incidentally now a small-town lawyer in New Zealand."
5,Quiet and Efficient,"I put one of these in my latest homebuilt quad core PC, and am amazed at how quiet it is, which is important to me because loud PCs drive me crazy. I've had no problems at all in several months of use. The modular cabling was a real plus, since there was no need to deal with extra cables getting in the way during the installation. Zalman rates the efficiency at 84%, which is phenomenal.By the way, Amazon's description of this product is not correct, since they are describing the Zalman CNPS9700 CPU cooler, and not the Zalman ZM600-HP power supply. The correct description is here:[...]"
1,Worst Customer Service!,"My Zalman ZM600HP is now in the Recycle Center! a year and a half old and a cap failed causing a diode and resister to catch fire and smoke up the room.Worst Customer Service I have ever experienced, it took 2 weeks for them to give me a RMA after many hours spent calling and emailing both numerous times.I have Zalman coolers on both my Desktops but will never buy another Zalman product thanks to their Very Poor Customer Service.I am pretty mad right now but be warned they are no good if you need Warranty Service, your throwing Money away if you need to return something to them ."
1,BEWARE!!! EXTREMELY DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING!!!!!,"This lamp requires a shade that you must purchase seperately. The picture on this site does NOT SHOW YOU THE TOP OF THE LAMP!!! While the picture makes it appear that the lamp may be lit from the base, the top actually has a fitting for a bulb and a shade. Also, when the lamp shipped, the instructions for assembly claim that all of the fittings are included in the box. None of them were. Lamps Plus has not been at all prompt in responding to my request for the missing parts. If I could rate this product lower, I would.BEWARE!!!!! DO NOT FALL INTO THE TRAP!!!!!"
4,Seat cushion,"This has been an excellent cushion for my needs. I had a hip replaced and needed to sit higher in my chair so that I could maintain ""hip precautions."" It has served well. If I had one suggestion, it would be to make the cushion deeper. I managed using a bed pillow behind my back."
1,Not Good for Sitting,"I bought this cushion to help me get through long meetings and events. (I have both arthritis and sciatica.) It is much too thick and unyielding to be at all comfortable. In short, it is miserable. I gave it away. What a waste of money!"
5,Great condition for slightly used.,"We had been at this museum and this book had many of the pieces of art we saw. It was in great condition for slightly used (looked like new). The book which has beautiful pictures also has great commentary on the artists, periods and information on the pieces of artwork."
2,Horrible Textbook,"This textbook, is horribly written. It is does not explain concepts and examples in a sequential manner. Would not recommend this book for understanding fluid mechanics."
4,Fluid mechanics refresher,This book is kind of refresher course for fluid mechanics. Its not extensive but covers the basics with some applications which is required for any fresher course.
3,Damaged Book,"I bought this book used and was expecting the cover to be a little damaged like they said it would be, but upon receiving it the book was just in a sealed plastic bag with no packaging of any kind and the books bind at the top had been smashed down and ripped. Not a big deal but they should take more care in shipping their products, even if it is only a short distance. Otherwise book is clean."
3,Alright text,I have to say that this text was a little too verbose. The subject is difficult so text cannot be blamed entirely for it being boring.
4,A FOUNTAIN OF CLASSIC COMEDY TV INFORMATION,"This is a must have for anyone who enjoys those oldie but goodie tv comedies. My one disappointment was that it did not contain an episode guide for one of my favorite TV sitcoms, ""I Married Joan"". It's almost impossible to find out anything about that show and it would have been great if it had been included in this somewhat exhaustive work. My request to the writers is to include this info in the next edition (if there is one and I hope there is). There were others I would have like to have seen included too, but Joan was the really missed one."
4,Works as expected,"This repeater is simply two different length antennae. Actual signal is perhaps doubled but that's not much. I get two, three bars in a 1+ bar area. Put one on top of a 20 ft. flagpole. heh. Raises coverage from none to marginal. Not cancelling my land line. Other two are on early model cars. Can talk inside now."
1,What?,This does not do a thing! The only thing it did is make my wife question my thinking! Very good quality though
4,Boosts Signal in Hard-To-Reach Areas,"This product seems like a gimmick, but I was willing to try anything to get better service in some spots in the town where I attend school.This antenna really does help. I can't vouch for improvements in walkie-talkie service with Nextel, as I was still unable to get service in the same areas, but it made vast improvements with my Sprint voice service. I found up to 1 bar service increases, plus enhanced voice quality and less static.If you're looking for a cheap passive repeater, this is it. Unless you live in an area where service is barely existing and a dynamic repeater is required, this antenna will do the job."
1,no,"Put it up in my dorm and there was no change at all. Followed all of the instructions to a ""T"" (there aren't that many). This really isn't worth your time and money."
1,junk,Don't buy complete junk waste of money. As easy as it is to install is still to much time to waste to put up. Does nothing. JUNK!
1,Antenna,"Unfortunately this is another waste of money. It doesn't do anything, the reception is exactly the same with or without the antenna. Do not waste your money....."
1,JUST ANOTHER FLEECING,Totally a Waste of Money and time. No difference in cell phone signals what-so-ever.Save you money as this passive repeater antenna doesn't work at all.The service I got from the supplier was great. Too bad the product wasnt tested before selling it.
1,Didnt Work,Dont wasted your money this antenna dint work at all same reception as before. Try going to your carrier and ask for a product that help you with this or spend around $200 and get the good product
3,Cell phone booster antenae,I live in a fringe area. I purchased this to help boost 3g reception. It has improved data transfer slightly and raised reception by two bars. Not bad for the money.
2,Doesn't make much difference.,"If you're going to put it on your car, put it on glass that isn't tinted. It makes very LITTLE differnce in reception."
1,Doesn't actually work,"Bought this so I could get some reception in a basement apartment; wasn't really expecting anything, but for @ $5 I figured what the hell. Lived up to expectacions, since it did nothing. Don't waste your cash."
2,Cellet Antenna Repeater,"This antenna does NOT work. It provides ZERO signal strength, in contrast to as advertised."
1,Really didn't HELP!!,"I bought this hoping to get at LEAST one bar, on my cell phone, in my home but no such luck!!! The seller was quick but product no good."
1,Antenna Review,This antenna did not make any improvement in the cellular signal when I mounted it on my vehicle.
3,Antenna review,"Recieved the product as promised and it was easy to install, but the product does not work as well as it is advertised, I would not purchase another one."
1,Useless - does nothing except look pretty!,I installed the antenna as per instructions and it did NOTHING. Zilch.... NadaFind something else if you're serious about getting an extra bar.This device is a total waste
5,Works Great. Strong signal after installing this at HOME,"I am an AT&T customer and was getting only one bar with frequent dropped calls or sometimes no signal in my apartment room. But outside my apartment, I had 1-2 bars. I installed this antenna on my glass window. WOW... it gives me 3-4 bars and no dropped calls. The signal is weak only if it is rainy outside. Great buy if you are in similar situation."
1,Total SCAM,"Much like the fad with magic stickers, (promoted as signal ""boosters"" and ""enhancers"") this is a total sham- but I fell for it. Has no discernible effect whatsoever on cell signal, regardless of where placed in vehicle. (tried directly touching it) - Would never buy again. Had no additional benefit in stronger areas, useless in rural dead zones- will probably have to consider a proper signal amplifier system. ($100+)"
2,junk,it didn't do much of anything. i would not buy again. i didn't see any improvement in my reception. it was junk
1,This item is not real,"I ordered this item thinking it would work, this item is not real. Its only made of plaste and have no way of helpping your cell phone singal."
2,I know you really want this work but,"It doesn't, I'm so so sorry that your car or home doesn't have good reception like me, it's a bummer but don't make the same mistake as me. This doesn't work I promise you. My suggestion is to use wifi calling or if you have a house buy a repeater for under $100 but make sure it works with your bandwidth and not a conflict with emergency lines."
1,does not work,dont waste your money.. does NOT work... I got it thinking that my cell phone would pick up better in our mobile home.. but it done nothing.. I would of returned it.. but i paid very little for it.. so it got filed in the trash...
1,Bad!,The antenna does not work! I was very dissapointed. My radio still has static. It doesnt have information on how to program the antenba with the radio.
2,waste,"Just as described. No issues and was shipped fast. Seemed like a waste of money to me, do not think that it helps, but it may. No problem with this company and received just as they said."
4,it boost signal alittle...but it does look good,"i don't know if this antenna does its job as a repeater, i think my network signal hasn't changed i head to the outskirts that has low signal. I guess it because i live in the New York City. The antenna does look stylish though."
1,didn't work,"This did not work for me. Took a shot for the price. Tried several locations and made no difference on the cordless phone either. You might need the right COMBINATION of signal strength, cell phone antenna and carrier signal- no way to tell."
1,Did not work at all,This Antenna is a complete waste of money. It made absolutely no difference in the signal what soever. at least it didn't make it worse.
1,zero impact on signal strength,"This ""passive repeater' was a complete waste of time and money. It does absolutely nothing to improve signal strength. It's shameful that amazon markets such misleading products. Do not buy this thing."
3,ok i guess...,"I can't notice any difference. Kinda looks cool, and it's cheap enough to try...My problem could be more with my phone."
1,Does not work at all,"We have some property where we have very little cell phone coverage, sometimes I have signals. In the middle of a conversation the signal will drop and lose the call.With this in mind a larger antenna would and should work since there is a signal just very poor.I bought several of these, mounted on each vehicle. I can tell no difference at all."
1,Dont Buy Worthless,This Item might look good. But it is worthless. The Tape on the bottom to hold it down not good. It blow right off the car. And it really does not work at all. did not change the range of any signal.
2,doesn't work at home,"I didn't see a improvement in performance, but I was trying to use it through double pane glass. It may work in a car, not sure"
1,No difference,"I bought it for my daughter as we live on the fringe of cell phone reception. Thought it might help, but we didn't notice any difference at all."
1,Returned It,"This antenna would barely stay mounted, so I have a difficult time even assessing its full function. For the little bit of time I could get it to stay on, it didn't seem to make much of a difference for me. I returned it and am exploring better options."
1,Useless,"I have owned one of these and I have tested them in several conditions. They do absolutely nothing. These items are merely small pieces of metal and plastic with no function. Like many of the cheap ""secrets"" of boosting cellular signals, this is nothing but a scam."
3,What kind of title?,It seems to help but at times it is hard to tell. I will know more when it has been put through the paces more. Maybe there will be a follow up review at that time. It is easy to use.
3,cell phone repeater,Live in the hills. Reception is low. This item boosted cell reception for both car & R.V.. Give this a try if reception fades out.
3,Works okay,I live out in the country where there are not alot fo towers. So I got this to see if it would help get better signal. It seemed to help alittle bit.
1,"Nice try, but no success",Did not extend cell phone range in my basement. I don't know the target use of this item but it didn't work for me.
1,Don't see any improvement,"I bought two of these. I live in the City in San Antonio Texas and thought they would help, but they are junk."
3,Fun hitman story with some dated references,"The story's wonderful: a hitman with a heart of gold who lives incognito in Los Angeles and runs a restaurant with his buddy from the Army. Whenever a hit comes up, he's alerted by his answering service and he goes on the road to perform the deed. The action is brutal, swift and crisp. The book was published in the mid-70s, and was lauded as a best-of-the-month by the NYTimes, if that matters to you, but it reads as if it may have been written in the late 60s. The racial epithets expressed by all the characters are offensive by today's standards, and the sex scenes might actually shock some readers."
5,Nice CD,"I was in junior high when Charlie Rich was popular, but have always loved ""Behind Closed Doors"" and ""The Most Beautiful Girl"". This CD showcases some of his other songs some that are a little familiar and some that are not, but I enjoyed all of them and enjoy listening to this CD."
5,The Silver Fox: My intro to Country Music,"I foundly remember hearing ""Behind Closed Doors"" and ""The Most Beautiful Women in the World"" and wondering out loud sometimes ""Why is my mom playing this?"" Well soon I realized why...the Silver Fox was a damn good singer and his songs had a profound meaning. Living in South Central Los Angeles it was rare to hear this type of music playing or played, but my mom played it and she played it often enough that I would go to school singing ""The Most Beautiful Women in the World"". Now 20 odd years later I play this for my kids and they appreciate the music and his voice just like I did."
4,Showcase for a Great Talent,"This CD includes Charlie's greatest song (Behind Closed Doors), his biggest hit (Most Beautiful Girl in the World), and another good minor hit, I Take It On Home. But the reason for buying the CD was to hear unknown songs. His soulful, country voice is excellent throughout. The CD deserves 4.5 stars, but not 5, only because some of the songs themselves are not top-notch. The 2nd best song is Ruby, You're Warm, about a man who finds comfort in another woman's arms. Good songs of faithfulness and appreciation are If You Wouldn't Be My Lady, A Sunday Kind of Woman, We Love Each Other, and I've Got Mine. The gospel-tinged Papa Was a Good Man is fun to listen to, despite its sad theme. 'Til I Can Take It Anymore is also a strong cut. With a low price and 15 songs, this CD is a great bargain for all Charlie Rich fans."
2,Stereo versions of the Part One songs,"Part 4 - The Final Act is a misnomer. Psychedelic Moods is a five CD set. This disc contains stereo versions of the songs by The Deep and Hydro Pyro, more or less than same band. Amazingly, some of the songs song better than in mono but all are still pretty lame."
5,exactly what I wanted,I was looking for small plates with this design but didn't want to buy a whole place setting (which is what the dept stores had.) These were exactly what I wanted for serving Christmas cookies/dessert to guests with the matching mugs. Arrived promptly.
1,Worst book on .net web services ever,This is a total disaster. The authors don't know how to present material for readers to understand. Examples are half cooked and mixed up between soap 1.1 and soap 1.2.
1,Confusing and rehash of documentation.,The book is very confusing. Not clear and concise. Several of the chapters seems to be rehash of documentation meant to increase the size of the book.
3,Nazareth - 'Malice In Wonderland' (Castle),"Originally released in 1980, as I remember the very day this record hit the stores. A decent later-day Nazareth effort. Tunes I liked best were the radio friendly ""Holiday"", ""Talking To One Of The Boys"",""Talking About Love"" and the four added bonus tracks, ""Razamanaz"", ""Hair Of The Dog"" plus two more, apparently taked from a live EP. Basically, just fairly good '70's album hard rock to be fully experienced here. Enjoy."
2,Trust me - over rated!,"To say that Nazareth sold out on this one may be wrong, but what's true is that their musical direction got changed as a new decade began. Personally I don't think ""Malice in wonderland"" is that great. Of course you get some good music, especially in the opener ""Holiday"". The ballad ""Heart's grown cold"" is also one of the albums better tracks, but over all this effort can not compete with earlier albums like ""Loud `n' proud"", ""Hair of the dog"" or ""Expect no mercy"". This is not the best starting point to explore Nazareth."
4,party Nazareth,this cd was out standing and i just love classical music with out it i would me nothing everbody should check it out its amazing Cd out of the hole cd i would have to go strongly go with big boy
4,"An intriguing, though somewhat disappointing novel","A good first novel written by an obviously gifted writer. The plot, though predictable, is still interesting, and though by the time the characters have been introduced it is painfully obvious how it is going to end, you still find yourself sticking around to see how things reach the highly predictable conclusion. Despite it's obvious outcome, the events leading up to it are totally original, and you start to get involved in the story and it's characters, who, though their psyches are explored indepth, tend to lack personality. With a little less filler and a little more experience, Nykanen obviously has the imagination and the gift for good writing to produce more wonderful novels to come."
2,"This book sacrificed plot for graphic, sensational sex.","The use of art therapy as a central element in the plot development of this book was fresh and fascinating. Unfortunately, the book degenerates into a graphic description of violent sexual acts that detracts from the plot. More ""detecting"" with the art therapy and less focus on sadistic acts would have made the book a better read."
5,"Taut, gripping page-turner!","This was a fabulous book! Full of suspense, my hands were glued to the book and could not put it down until I read the final word. Not for the faint of heart.Celia, an art therapist, develops a particular bond with Davy, a child who has witnessed horrors no child (or adult) should ever be exposed to. Davy doesn't speak, and communicates only with Celia through his drawings. Celia becomes his advocate when others believe he is beyond reach and in so doing, immeshes herself in a world of violence and fear."
2,"More plodding than suspenseful, annoying in its wordiness","After reading so many good reviews, I was really looking forward to this book. Unfortunately, I felt the book did not live up to the glowing reviews. It was plodding and cliche'-ridden to the end. And speaking of the ending, I pretty much had it figured out about halfway throught the book. I did like the insight into art therapy and how it is used in child abuse cases. Other than that, I'd have to say that this ""suspense"" novel was more annoying than suspenseful."
2,Ick!,"This guy writes a good thriller, but this one was too disturbing and harsh for the likes of me."
4,Black Metal from Norway,"This is the second CD from Norway's Mactatus. They have come into their own sound now providing excellent black metal with a slower guitar riffs, pounding drums and a better sound this time around... we also have keys here and there... a good solid release.cheersg"
2,Not the best.,"What's missing from this book is vastly more transcripts of the interrogations of Kiki Camarena that transpired over a two-day period, Feb. 7-9, 1985. There were several, if not numerous, tapes, yet this book contains only bits and pieces that, when viewed as a whole, don't really add much to the book. I've found portions of transcripts online and in a news magazine that were far more interesting than those published in this book. I don't know why the author wrote an ABRIDGED version of the whole story. You just don't get the whole story in this book. That's the disappointment."
5,Good review.,"This book is a great reference for the topics of high-brightness LEDs. Although the section for nitride based LEDs is slightly dated (1997), the entire book is a great review of the recent history of the development of high-brightness LEDs. It also has a great chapter on applications for the LED and its future markets. I recommend it for anyone who wishes an all encompasing source for recent LED progress."
4,"THE Best ""Early Years"" recording of Madonna!","Before there was Lucky Star, there was a pre-madonna who fought hard to get what she wanted... Now that she is the Icon of the century, WE can hear those ""lost"" recordings. This is (by far) the best of the ""early recordings"" available on the market regarding Madonna. The songs are a not bad and the sound is great. It includes some great remixes of ""Everybody"" (her first ever simple) in a regeae style 97 mix. Buy it!"
4,Actually 3.5 stars,"Well, there are 6 out of the 9 tracks on here that are good. This is a re-release of the Pre-Madonna album and the cover picture is just amazing! Being a Madonna fan, I had to pick this up. I was not dissapointed, but the other 3 tracks are just mediocre.Good Songs:* Everybody ('97)* Ain't No Big Deal ('97)* Burning Up* Everybody ('81)* Ain't No Big Deal ('81)* Stay ('81)Stay is my personal favourite. Crimes Of Passion, Don't You Know and Laugh To Keep From Crying are just okay tracks."
1,The Magnavox MRV640/17 resembles a DVD Recorder but adds three undocumented features.,"(1) The clock loses one minute per week, so you don't have the sit through the unrecorded beginnings of TV shows. (2) It records disks that inexplicably freeze-frame and jump forward when fast-forwarded on playback. (DVDs recorded on a different DVD Recorder behave normally.) (3) Nine months following purchase, any new attempt to record a DVD instead display a ""DISC ERR"" message. This last feature relieves the user from wasted hours spent watching recorded shows when he could better spend his time writing this acerbic product review."
1,"Looks great, But Take it back!","I bought the MRV640 DVD Recorder. It has all the jacks and formats one would desire on the recorder. The first night out of the box, the message ""BLOCKED"" was displayed right after the disk stopped playing. You can't restart the unit by recycling power or get the disk out. BTW, the booklet indicates there is a problem but no way for the consumer to fix it. I took it back to Best Buy and got another unit. That one lasted a month - same problem. The service was very kind and asked if I would like another. No thanks, So I bought a Panasonic.If Philips/Magnavox knows there is a ""BLOCKED"" problem, then get it fixed before the unit is ready for the public. There is nothing blocking the cd drawer, so this is a quality control problem not a user issue.Don't waste you time, choose another brand."
2,"Works great, when you can get it to work","I have had this dvd recorder for about 3 weeks now. I program it to record a few shows every day. On about every 3rd or 4th one, the screen will have a blue tint to it. But my MAJOR complaint is, it is very picky about the discs. It wont play most of my store bought movies. Today I tried to watch my 2nd season of the Gilmore girls, watched the 1st disc, when I out the second one in, it kept saying disc error. Or it would show no disc at all, tried with 3 and 4 as well, same problem. This has happened on several occasions with many different movies. Even worse is sometimes I will be about 20 mins into a movie and it will freeze, I take it out, put it back in then get disc error. I am returning this DVD recorder in the morning. It is junk....."
1,Piece of crap,"I bought this unit on october 2007 and a week ago (december 2008) it stopped working saying ""no disc"" and it does not matter which kind of disc I use. Tried cleaning the lens, nothing. I have to shake it and bump it so it barely reads it and then it sounds like it is scrapping somewhere.I didn't use it too much (less than 1 hour per week) and never used it as a player to avoid unnecesary wear. Still it didn't last what I expected."
2,Worked great for a while...then it didn't!,"I have always had a high opinion of Magnavox products - but this one is a lemon. Highly recommend you find another machine. Mine just concluded it's warranty for parts - and is a very large paperweight. Every once in a while a glitch would happen, and I would reset the machine and I would be able to use it.This week the whole thing crashed and I have maybe a half a dozen dvds of tv shows that I had not ""finalized"", which means I won't be able to unless I buy another one of these dreadful machines!Stay away from this product. You will be much happier!Michelle"
1,unreliable,I've sent mine in for repair once already. Now it is up to a new bag of tricks. It appears to be recording but won't finalize the disk saying nothing is there. OR it stops recording with no warning. OR it records for half the disk then says it's unreadable.I would never buy one of these again.Pam
4,Does what it says it does,"I just recieved my DVD recorder and after experiencing some initial set up problems (my own)......you need to go through the channel search even if you have a satelite or cable source...... I tested the recording mode, playback mode and timed recording and all worked just as the manuel says they were suppose to. I haven't recorded from an outside source (VCR or Camcorder) nor have I used any of the more ""advanced"" options it has. My intent is to record some old family VCRs and programs from the TV so I don't expect to test (or use) most of the options.Since it does what it said it would do and that's all I expect it to do I'm satisfied with the product."
1,Magnavox...not very smart!,"This was my second attempt at a DVD recorder and this one was actually worse than the first one (see my review on the GoVideo). First, the manual is terribly written and the on-screen hyroglypics are horrible. Very user un-friendly. After first hooking it up, it wouldn't recognize ANY disc; R, RW, or pre-recorded concert DVD's. Finally, I got it to recognize everything except recorded +R's, so I tried to record something using the timer. After supposedly recording the programs, I couldnt' get the machine to turn on! I had to unplug it to get the disk out, and then there wasn't even anything on it. I tried it again...saw that it was recording...and when it was done, still couldn't get it open! Very frustrating...so I'm taking it back ASAP!. I decided after reading reviews that all DVD recorders have problems of one kind or another, so I'm only buying locally, to save the hassle of return shipping. I may try Sony next, since I have a regular Sony DVD and it works fine."
2,"OK, but just not good enough","The designers, in a moment of sheer stupidity, left off the fast-forward and rewind buttons standard in most designs. A couple of days later I finally figured out that you have to hold down the chapter forward/reverse buttons to search through the DVD. The manual is difficult to read, so it contributed to the problem.More importantly, I tried to edit out commercials using the ""hide chapter"" feature, but they showed up anyway when I tried to play the DVD back on my good Samsung DVD player. Also, while the recordings play back OK on this machine, they periodically skip on my Samsung DVD player, which normally plays DVD+R disks fine when I create them on my computer. Disks seem to play OK on an older Toshiba DVD player, so it is probably hit and miss whether or not the disks will play on other devices. I'm not willing to put up with this, so I'm going to pay more for a Toshiba with a built-in hard drive and can really edit out the commercials."
1,Help Please!!,"For the life of me I haven't been able to get the edited DVD+R's to play its edited version on any other machines but the recorder. The other machines read the disc but only as one file/chapter where's the recorder reads the edited version with all chapters intact. Can anyone help me with this please?? BTW, this review has the potential to got up to 4 stars because I'm very satisfied with the picture quality (I've only used the 3 hour speed) and everything else was very easy to use."
1,Open box disaster,"I originally wanted a non-brand DVD recorder but a well-known store had an open box version of this one. It came with no power cord which was easily purchased at a local electronics store. However, when I arrived home, the remote was no where to be found. Since we just moved I thought I might have misplaced it. After a week of searching, I decided to buy a universal remote which might work AFTER you get past the initial installation process (!?!) However you CAN NOT get past the original set-up without the original remote. I didn't read the reviews on this machine until I got home because Magnavox is typically a pretty good brand. My mistake. I'm going to take it back and stick with my original decision to buy the well-reviewed non-brand.So in summary, who knows how the machine really works. Who ever heard of having to INSTALL a stand alone DVD recorder? My last final 2 cents--DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It was discontinued for a REASON!"
1,I was expecting something more,"I'm a a huge fan of Syd Mead, and I've bought Visual Futurist and I love it.When I saw this DVD I thought it had more new work to see, but I was really sad to see that this DVD was only like 10 min long, and after I bought it...It's up two you but I don't think it is worthy...Thanks"
1,2019: Future Imagined,"This is absolutely one of the worst items I've ever purchased. I would give a value of $2.00. The title should be something like ""8 Minute Rambling on Artist."" The title might lead one to ""hope"" for some insight into what ""more"" this artist envisions rather than just comment on old stuff and show him drawing. This was very disappointing and is the epitomy of ""leaving one hanging."" The video is obviously a strict money generator rather than an opportunity to lead the viewer in dreaming and creating."
2,Short but sweet,"It's only eight minutes, and probably not worth purchasing unless necessary. I just needed some good quotes for a project over Mead's ideas and it proved sufficient enough."
2,Collection of newsreels,"I'm disappointed in this purchase. It's a collection of Movietone newsreels containing fragments of speeches. The video quality is often poor, overexposed with too much contrast. (I know better quality video exists of the same speeches and events.) The video is often out of sync with the audio, also. Regardless, I'm not throwing it away!-Don Grantham"
4,TB knows his generation quite well & braves interpreting it.,"This book is great for people with questions about 'peculiar' GenX behavior and what may be behind it. Beaudoin really understands the many expressions of his generation -- has really done a lot of work to study it.Whether you agree or disagree with his interpretations, they give plenty of food for thought and seem quite plausible. From a Christian perspective, I'd say he's a bit syncretistic, baptizing too much of the culture in the name of healthy 'spiritual quest.' But no one can deny that the inner struggles, feelings and questions of Gen-Xers tend to be as Beaudoin depicts. I found it well-articulated and very helpful and insightful, even when I disagreed about his proposals and theories.For anyone wanting to communicate better, understand and reach out to meet the real, inner needs of this generation, I highly recommended this book."
3,"From a campus pastor - ""Let the conversation continue!""","I recently heard the author speak at a conference I attended. He did make some disclaimers at the beginning of his presentation - his book was not inclusive in terms of research with minority cultures - it did reflect experiences of middle class and not poor - BUT I found him to be honest and forthright in putting on the table some interpretations worthy of further conversation, and certainly ""on target"" in reflecting attitudes and behaviors of those students walking on the campus I serve. I wonder why no mention is made, however, of H.Richard Niebuhr's classic, ""Christ and Culture"" since Beaudoin is so fascinated with the interaction of pop culture and religion. These are ""ambiguous days"" when it comes to the institutional church knowing how to relate to GenX and GenY folk."
5,a must-read,"It's idiosyncratic, it's over the top in places, it might even be rehashed grad school papers, but I don't care. Beaudoin is right on the mark overall. As a GenX clergyperson, I wish every hierarch and denominational official in the USA could be locked in a room until they all finished this book."
4,An inspiring approach that leaves some questions to be asked,"Tom's book is a most inspiring description and analysis of a generation's approach to spirituality and faith. Although I am from a different background (Germany) I count myself among the generation Tom describes. Phenomenons in German pop culture vary from America; yet I found myself in a lot of the examples Tom describes. Especially enlighting are his analyses of Music videos, irony, and the use of signs and symbols, and - most of all - the way Tom explains the spiritual questions Xers seem to ask. For a practical theologian it is a helpful book to take a look at religious elements in popular and civil culture. The book, however, raises questions concerning systematics. A systematic approach to define spirituality, religion, religious elements would do no harm. But those are questions yet to be discussed. Tom Beaudoin's approach is very helpful as first steps ."
4,Perfect For the Future Chemist or Science Teacher!,"If ever someone needs to be cheered up, or if you're just in the mood for some high-time bragging rights, this book is the one you should buy! With some really great tricks and good information, I believe practically anyone could enjoy it! And if you're in need for a present for your favorite future chemist or scientist, this book will definitely kick them off! :) A great book!:)"
5,This was a very dramatic story of the world of drugs,"Matt Dillon portayes this drug attict in a way only he can. Amazing and fun to watch, the movie makes you cry, laugh, and have hope for new beginnings."
4,Druggies on Film,"There is a genre, Druggies on Film. You can go back to silent movies where the guy with a mustache drugs the heroine. Reefer Madness and Sinatra's, Man with the Golden Arm continued this type of drama. More recently we have seen Spun and Requiem for a Dream. The truth is, I liked them all. My own illicit drug intake had happened mostly back in the 60's and 70's, and I remember some of the mantic behavior and weirdly, the camaraderie. Yes, it was we against the world. Drugstore Cowboy does a terrific job of recreating this type of subculture. Matt Dillion is wonderful as the young brain behind the gang of pill robbers. His sudden need for rehabilitation is not very convincing, but all his schemes, rehab, and love for Kelly Lynch rings true. James Le Gros and Heather Graham play dumb and dumber. Dillion's druggie wife Lynch, she is so seventies hard girl. Finally, the great druggie of them all gets a cameo role, Beat writer, William Burroughs."
3,Druggy life doesn't pay but this movie is good good good,"Powerful movie about drugs that seem low budgeted but so what. It's still worth watching. Matt Dillon performance is outstanding. Maybe these are the type of roles he is good at...tough guy attitude, just like the classic 'my bodyguard' movie. I enjoy this but not a movie i want to see again since it doesn't have a real happy ending.If you have anyone close to you who take drugs, i suggest watching this movie."
4,"real, hilarious, and absolutely crazy...","The story of Bob and his drugstore raids through various cities is a very real story. This movie, however- doesn't so much offer into the insights of what it is like when you get drugged up or high. This is a movie about the lifestyle Bob and Diane lead- the drugstores they raided, the scores they made, the encounters they had along the way, and what eventually led to Bob going to rehab in the very end.About ? of the movie is focused on Bobs ""recovery"" or attempts to get his life back on track. He goes and gets a job, he goes to the methadone program, he completely gives up on his relationship with Diane... he makes a commitment to be completely drug free- and in the end it is tragic what happens.Go see this movie! There has never been one like it before; it is interesting to watch the lifestyle these people live."
2,Where's the dialogue editor?,"Let me first say, I am a huge Gus Van Sant fan. However, this film is just not that good. The acting is pretty mundane, no real allstar performances, with the possible exception of Heather Graham, whose character dies off halfway through. And the dialogue is atrocious. For the most part, it's extremely cliche (much like the characters) and boring, and fails to progress the plot of the film. There are moments, but they are few and far between.Van Sant's visual style, however, is a small redeeming factor. The natural grittiness sets the mood well, and his ability to linger on a shot (though not as dramaticly as he would in films like Gerry) is noteable.It's really just not that great of a movie. The concept is a good one, but poor acting and dialogue really slow the film down and bore the audience, something a drug movie should never do. I'd recommend Trainspotting or Requiem for a Dream far before I would Drugstore Cowboy."
5,incredible,"The documentary with Dillon and Gus Van Zant discussing how they made the film was fantastic. Their is also a behind the scenes segment that show's the director setting up carious arty shots. For anyone who loved this movie the first time, the dvd is the icing on the cake. A must buy."
5,...and I always have to drive,"I have a friend who can't stand this movie -- which leads me to distrust her (then again, her favorite movies are romantic comedies wherein the couples end up together). Dillon is great, and I'm not even a fan of his. Can't help but watch stunning Graham. Beautifully ambiguous ending. One of my all-time favorites. And I never have to drive."
3,Drug StorY,"Just another story about drugs and dope dealing. At least he gets clean in the end, but it should have left you with more of an ending."
4,Something to offer even the non-golfer,"I expected this book to only be of interest to the golfer. But reading a friend's copy on a plane convinced me to pick it up for myself; there are great stories in here, that apply the lessons of golf to life. And, frankly, the ""no name"" contributors are often more touching than their more famous peers. Good stuff."
4,"Good Stuff Here, Something For Everyone","A good relaxing golf read, not too deep, occasionally inspiring, and at times laugh out loud funny. Golf story after golf story, just the way we golfers (or would be golfers) like it.Great casual read, a pick it up, put it down, pick it up kind of read. Good for reading, as Winston Churchill would say, ""in the smallest room of the house."""
2,"OK, I Guess","Why can't books of inspiration and insight have some humor that illustrates the points being made. I found this tape to be maudlin and overwrought with poignancy which did not inspire me nor shed any new insights. The stories were ok, but there is a lot more to golf than what I heard on this tape. Needless to say, I was disappointed."
5,a must for golfers,"This read with the 101 different short stories and catchy quotes was very entertaining. I especially liked the one with the little girl that was playing by herself and carded a hole in one, unwitnessed, until the engineer of a passing train(the course boardered a nearby railway)sent a well wishing letter to her at the course. This and many others typify real golf experience to us golfers. If you golf, do yourself a favor and read this."
2,Ditch the first tape; watch the second!,"Yep... Alpha Centauri looks like he just came off a Muppets set. But sillier! The first of these two vids is definately (yawn) mediocre. The second tape's not bad though. Certainly a lot more action and, seemingly, better acting.One thing becomes quite obvious... the BBC is preparing its audience for the (death) regeneration of Jon Pertwee into Tom Baker, in the next story- Planet Of The Spiders. Jon and Liz do a more mature bit of acting here; perhaps there's genuine sorrow that the Pertwee era is soon to come to an end.Yep! Tape #2 is the one to watch! Heehee."
2,Way overpriced!,"I personally love this story. I think it's very underrated and has some wonderful cliffhangers and exciting moments that most fans don't seem to appreciate. The restoration by the esteemed Doctor Who Restoration Team is wonderful as usual, and the extras are also top notch.However, I feel I must protest against this price-gouching tactic of Warner Brothers/BBC Worldwide Video to separate the boxsets out so that they can charge more for each story. What could have been a boxset of 3 discs for about $39.95 becomes one 2-disc set for $32 and one 1 disc DVD for another $19. This is why this DVD gets only two stars. If you happen to be made of money, however, please feel free to buy this disc as it's really good.PLEASE STOP SPLITTING UP THE BOXSETS FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN RELEASES, WARNER BROTHERS! It's not fair!Thank you!"
4,Better than I expected,"I am a very big Doctor Who fan. And I remember watching this Doctor Who story, way back in the day. However, it was so long ago that I didn't remember much of it. I was interested in watching the sequel to the previous Doctor Who Peladon story. I'd read in other places where people didn't consider this to be a very good story, so my expectations were low. I was pleasantly surprised, however. No, it isn't the best story, and not the best Jon Pertwee Doctor Who story, either, but give it a try, I think you'll find it better than you expected."
4,Worked fine for printer but no bi-directional support.,Worked fine for printer but no bi-directional support. Will not work for scanner or multifunction. Printer works fine and setup was easy.
2,"not bad, not great","so i have my LaserJet 4000 hooked up through a USB hub, and every time i reboot my PC, the OS (Win XP) loses the driver (shows up as Unknown USB Driver).this is easily fixed if i unplug the cable from the hub port, plug into the another hub port, and then plug back into the original hub port.but what a hassle. i didnt see the other review about someone mentioning it doesnt work through a hub. mine does, though only if i unplug/replug everytime.you would think they would make these so they would work through a hub . . .:("
1,Not Compatible,Worked with my two Macbooks but not my Dell Laptop. I called the 1-866 number and they were not helpful so don't waste your time calling them.
4,excellent cable,"I gave up desktops. However, my laptop does not have parallet port. To my suprise, this conversion cable works well with my two laptops, Dell Vostro 1520 (winXP) and Dell latitude (E6400) (Win 7). This saved my 15-yr HP laserjet 6L. One caveat is that, each time you connect the cable, computer generate a new copy of the printer. u have to use the new copy for printing. If you have different laptop and printer, I am not sure if it will work as mentioned by other reviewers."
5,Works as can be expected,"Allows me to continue to use an old printer that cost a pretty penny back in the day. All plug and play but i still have to unplug and plug back in once or twice for windows vista to recognize the printer. I don't think this is a flaw in the cable, rather it's a flaw with the operating system."
1,Didn't Work,"It didn't work. I had a Win XP USB PC with an IEEE 1284 compliant printer, but it did not work. Kudos to Amazon for the return policy and picking up the return shipping."
2,Unsuccessful Employment,I was hoping to use this cable to connect my HP OJ K80xi printer to a Mac OSX 10.7.5 machine. Previous reviews gave me hope but no guarentee. It is not clear whether it was an inherent problem of the OSX USB backend or the fact that the USB connector was flaky. (Evidence for the latter is that it would not work on a Linux box whereas another cable would.)
4,Good but not great,"If you are familiar with using ergonomic keyboards, you'll probably like this model. I have been using a contoured keyboard for about 4 years. Even though it took a while to get used to the contour, I now have trouble going back to the old straight style. I also like the feel of the keys since I am a heavy-handed typer.I am replacing this keywboard with a new one because several of the keys are broken, which is part of why I downgraded the keyboard. I don't think the keys should have broken off so easily. Another issue I have is that it is quite large and uses a lot of desk space. This may be just a function of any contoured board, but I think a little engineering would result in a better design."
2,No built in MOUSE,What a shame! I thought the picture showed a mouse pad. I hope this company realizes their inaccuracy in advertising. I hope they pay for my return shipping as this is a darn waste of my time.
3,Rayovac 928,Use this battery for a light. Have had mixed results. It may be because of shelf life of product by distributer.
3,Blinders On,"A good album, not a great album; then again it's hard to compare Sean's solo work to the amazing Nickel Creek synergy."
4,"Read the Hal Horwitz/Amazon review, and give it another listen--it's great.","No, it's not always an easy listen, but few things that fall under the ""avant garde"" category are--and I'd say that most of this album easily does.It's well-realized, innovative, and probably Watkins' best showcase yet. From electronica to twentieth-century-esque art music (there's a twenty-second excerpt of a string quartet, ""Cammac""), Sean shows a new fluency and ease in the realm of pop music, an area he tried to break into with his last album, ""26 Miles."" It's a skillful record, and probably my favorite of his three solo works.And as a final note, speaking of ""Cammac""...I'm sorry to the first reviewer, but I'm also a ""classically trained violinist""--and to call it simply ""a muddy mess"" is to disregard its artistic merit and display a complete want for acceptance of non-traditional aesthetics. (Try listening to some George Crumb, if you think this was a horrifying use of strings...)."
5,Hal Horowitz's review at the top is 100% accurate - forget the naysayers!,"I've listened to 'Blinders On' several times and I 'get' it. A lot of the people who've commented here apparently don't, and that's okay. After reading Hal Horowitz's review of the record, it's apparent that he enjoyed the same record I did.Although 'Blinders On' can be easily digested in smaller portions, Watkin's latest is a very personal work that's best heard and understood in its entirety. It's all good, every little bit of it."
4,A Gentle Classic,"A gentle beautiful fantasy of a book. It's been claimed that Wodehouse is somewhat lacking in variety that if you've read one you've read them all. This book argues against that there is all the feeling and romance that anyone could ask for it is warm witty and wonderful, it maybe lacks the comfortability of a Jeeves or Blandings story or the freshness of Laughing Gas but it is still absolutely brilliant."
3,Great singer,"The singer is wonderful, as always. I was a bit disappointed in the music, much less joyful than I had expected. Also it is a short cd."
5,Very Good,The book was awesome and not all marked up. It has been a joy getting a book that is what it says it is. THNX
4,Not bad for a textbook,"What can you really say about a textbook? This one is fine, but there isn't anything that stands out about it. The product came on time and in good condition."
1,Sweet mother of God,"I've not read Karl May's other work, though I gather the main characters of this book - Kara ben Nemsi and Hadschi Halef Omar - appear in several other novels and are much beloved by people I've never talked to. Nonetheless, this book is just bad in so many ways I couldn't know where to begin.I almost find myself recommending it, as it has passages of some of the worst prose I have ever seen rendered in the English language. It truly is a thing of wonder. I don't think you really want to try it, though, as this book is tremendously long and slow as well. Given the choice, I would choose to be mugged and beaten rather than read this book again. But, sure, give it a try."
3,Departure from style of folder / folder 5,"I just want to say I bought this cd looking for something in the style of her old groups. Namely folder and folder 5. Its kind of cute, but its a far cry from the old music she used to sing. Just to let you fans out there know"
4,Great resource for future teachers or parents!,"This book is written very well and is very informative. I found this book to be a great tool for teachers. I read this book for a class and I felt that it kept my interest and made for easy reading material. This book provides parents and/or teachers with insight on how to help children learn to read. This book also includes many great activities and strategies to use to strengthen and encourage literacy (no matter what age the student is). I have tested many of the activities on students myself, and found that it made teaching and learning to read more enjoyable for everyone involved. Overall, I thought this book was great. I plan on keeping it as a resource in my classroom or even in my own home."
4,Moccasin Trail,"Moccasin Trail is a great book about a young trapper by the name of Jim Keath, who decides to follow the ways of his uncle and live with him. However, that dream was short-lived, for as he arrived at his uncle's camp, a large bear attacked him and Jim was badly hurt. He is saved from certain death by a group of Crow Indians, who treat him as one of their own. After six years of living with the Indians, Jim returns to his family to help them settle out West. The whole book tells of how Jim must reaccustom himself to the life of a white-man, and still keep the senses of an Indian so that he can help his family."
4,Moccasin Trail,"I really liked this book because it was full of adventure, and a little mystery. The book is about a boy named Jim who gets a letter from his family that he ran away from. Jim tries to gain the trust of his family, and hepl them get land in the west. It's a fun book to read with the entire family."
4,Wonderful Book; Disappointing Ending,"I've read the negative reviews asserting this as a racist novel, but I would suggest that rather than being racist, the book clearly illustrates two vastly different cultures butting up against one another: European settlers and Native Americans. Whenever that has happened throughout history, tensions arise, and the American West was no different. The reader has the joy of seeing the main character (a white man raised by Native Americans) struggle with his own identity as well the notion that neither side of this particular fence is better than the other; that life is not so clear cut. I read it aloud to my 9yo son, and we both rejoiced in the main character's ability to survive in the harsh surroundings of the old American west, especially when compared to the relatively subdued nature of the settlers. In the end, however, we were disappointed with the main character's ultimate choice."
5,???,How can it be so cheap i couldnt figure out. Xtr is twenty times expensive ??? you gotta be kiddin
1,Kids Party Pop,Very disappointed not what I thought it would be at all!!! Just some group of kids making there own music video to some popular music not creative at all. Anyone's kids and a couple of there friends could do this. I fact they would probably have more fun doing their own but they should keep it to their group not sell it to strangers.
1,*********SUFFOCATION RISK*****************,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM B/C BABIES DO LOVE THE TAGS ON THINGS BUT THIS EVENING MY 4 MONTH OLD ALMOST SUFFOCATED BECAUSE OF IT! I LOOKED OVER TO HER SITTING ON THE HER BOUNCY SEAT TO FIND THE 12 X 12 BLANKET COMPLETELY OVER HER FACE AND HEARD HER GASPING FOR AIR! I RUSHED OVER TO HER AND THANK GOD SHE WAS AND IS OK! I JUST WENT ON THE TAGGIES WEBSITE TO FIND THE BLANKET IS RECOMMENDED FOR ALL AGES AND IS APPROVED BY JMPA, TIA AND ICPHSO. I AM SURE MY BABY IS NOT THE FIRST TO HAVE THIS HAPPEN AND I WOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT BUYING THIS ITEM FOR A BABY DESPITE IT BEING RECOMMENDED FOR ALL AGES. THIS ALSO GOES TO SHOW THAT EVEN THOUGH AN ITEM IS APPROVED BY VARIOUS SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS, THAT MAY NOT MEAN THE ITEM IS IN FACT SAFE."
2,Not my cup of tea.,"I bought this CD but I'll probably sell it again.The interpretation is flat, and does not have the depth that many German singers give to these songs.After a while also Bostridge's voice became annoying to me. For instance that horrible cry on track 2(?). What is he trying to convey?Sorry, it simply does not do it for me.I prefer Quasthoff for these songs."
2,alagio hawaiian nut shampoo,"i used this shampoo in february when i was visiting my sister in fla. and fell in love with it! i came home and googled it and found that publix carried it,so asked my daughter to pick some up for me,(no publix in the mountains where i live,)and she was told that hawaiian nut was discontinued.i went on line and found it and ordered it although the container was different, i took a chance against my better judgment!MISTAKE!!!it dosen't even smell the same,not even close!i am very disappointed in the product!!was going to send it back,instead i gave it away. GOOD LESSON LEARNED....DO NOT ORDER A PRODUCT THAT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED BY THE COMPANY......."
4,The Best Bruckner Compilation,"Scrowaczewski isn't very well known, but he's been around since before the sixties, (conducted Chopin Piano Concerto with Arthur Rubinstein in the early Sixties). This highly recommendable set is as close as you can come to a full view of Bruckner. It has his complete symphonies, including his ""0"" and ""00"" symphonies, his Overture(the only other recording along side Chailly's) and the Adagio(from String Quintet). Digital recordings, sound is amazing. Interpretation is second to none. He's not a Karajan or a Jochum but he knows how to build Cathedrals! Scrowaczewski brings out a lot more smooth and warm playing from the brass, not as Neurotic as Furtwangler. The set comes in palm size. I prefer this set over Solti's for some reason. I compare this set along side Gunter Wand's set."
3,"lots to enjoy, except the title","any story that opens with a buffalo in a suburban front yard has a lot going for it. sprinkle has a great way with a phrase, her characters are well drawn, there's good dialogue, but this otherwise decent mystery got three stars because the title gives away a major piece of the puzzle. and also because an important clue is actually waved in the reader's face.i enjoyed the author's first series (_murder at buckhead_, and others) so i know the author has done better and will read at least one other title in this series in the hopes that it will be up to her previous standard."
4,Thoroughly Southern Mysteries,"This mystery series by Patricia Sprinkle is great! The book keeps ones interest from the first page. I think cozy mystery readers should definitely try this series. The book ""When Will the Dead Lady Sing?"" is number six in the series."
1,I Got A Lemon,"Delivery time was excellent. When I opened the package and began reading the installation instructions, I found that the instructions were not written for the model I received because the instructions described menu items that did not exist. I contacted the manufacturer and was sent to a url to download a ""New"" driver. I did, but when I tried using the PCI card, my entire system slowed to a crawl. The board recognized my SATA DVD player but would not function beyond that. I sent the board back and my money was returned. Amazon provided outstanding customer service but the item was flawed."
3,Low profile for Green but still worth 3 & a half stars.,"Back in 1979 i got caught out when i first purchased this one. On closer inspection you'll find that Peter hardly plays on these late 70s albums like ""In The Skies"" & ""Little Dreamer"". Snowy White was the guitarist who, very reluctantly, laid down alot of the lead work on Peter Greens directions during these days.Snowy regrets having done this as his initial aim was to re-vitalise Greens career but when they got to the studio Peter just didn't want to play. He eventually did play abit on certain tracks but his quality was nowhere in comparison to his early Mac days.Nevertheless Snowy White himself is one of the BEST Blues guitarists ever to pick up a Gibson Les Paul Goldtop and i don't regard this session as being a waste of time. There just isn't enough of Snowys playing to be heard these days. His style is almost inseparable from Peter Greens.I can't believe this was done all those years back."
5,Best of three worlds,"The Very Best of Peter Green has the best cuts off this CD, Little Dreamer and Whatcha Gonna Do.Peter's best three cds in my opinion.Hard to find but mp3mixx dot calm has it.You have to register to see prices but you'll be glad you did.They have most all of Peter's mp3s"
5,Love This Album!!!!,"It was a bitch tracking down Peter's albums back when they were released. I love all his work but it was this one in 79' that got me good. Great band and great tracks with the added bonus of being introduced to Snowy White on guitar doing some of his best work. The fact that six of the nine tracks being instrumentals was just what I needed to follow up ""End Of The Game"" a classic and still not available in the states."
3,"Don't be fooled - this is an anthology, not ""In The Skies""","Peter Green's 1978 solo release is simply magnificent. Restrained but heartfelt vocals, velvety guitar, clean and thoughtful arrangements and engineering. Like the best of early Fleetwood Mac (don't miss the 6 disk Complete Blue Horizon sessions), but even better. Unfortunately this budget release isn't it - it's an anthology of his late Seventies and early Eighties solo albums, most of which are sadly not as good as ""In The Skies."" In fact, this CD is virtually the same as another collection, ""Green and Guitar."" It has a few great cuts, but really you're much better off paying more and getting the real ""In The Skies,"" which you will not regret."
3,Great colors in picture BUT...,"the more situations i put this TV in, the more one thing irritates me. On the bottom of the screen there is a slight light that emits upward. Though MOSTLY unnoticeable, when watching dark settings in movies or games there is a light glare 6"" offset from center on the screen.When watching movies in 2.35:1 aspect (with black bars top and bottom) there is a constant white blur on the bottom of the screen. This TV simply has trouble in dark settings.I could be picky because i bet some people wouldn't notice or care. But seeing how i noticed in the first 20minutes of use, i have a hard time looking past it."
2,"Not the original ""Delta Dawn"" Lp on cd.","This is NOT the cd with the photo and song listing advertised. This is in fact an eight song live cd. With that in mind the eight songs are good. I would not have bought this had I known it was an eight song live cd, I would have chosen either ""Live at Billy Bob's"" or the MCA version of ""Tanya Live"". I feel a bit cheated."
3,Cannibal Swirls,"I've seen a lot worse with these types of cannibal exploitation movies. With these cannibal movies, it's easy to complain about the picture and sound quality, the acting, and the weak plots.While this does have some of that late 70's exploitation nostalgia, it is just a disordered movie. Cannibal Girls (1973) is absolutely absurd but surprisingly amusing as an exploitation movie, as Cliff and his girlfriend Gloria, depart for a weekend trip in Farnhamville, that is soon interrupted by three pesky cannibals.I understand why people would love this weary film, because it's so bad, but I found myself disappointed in the lack of - everything."
3,They Are Cannibals! They Are Girls! They Are Cannibal Girls!,"Cannibal Girls is sort of like an H.G. Lewis movie, only not near as gory or as entertaining. I was disappointed by this film because with a title like Cannibal Girls, you expect gory, trashy fun. What I got was about one minute of gore, and a couple of minutes of trashy fun. I almost gave this movie two stars instead of three, but the last ten minutes or so are what I expected the whole movie to be: bloody and disgusting. And this film has the hairiest men I've ever seen. There's one man who's arms and back are covered in hair. I'm sure if he would have taken his pants off, his butt would have been as well. Anyway, Cannibal Girls is only worth seeing for fans of 70's trash."
1,one size does not fit all,These gloves are way too large. My hand measures 6 3/4 inches long and 3 1/4 inch wide at the knuckles. There is an extra inch at the fingertips and the fingers are spaced too far apart.
4,Foot socks,"Comfortable, seem to keep the moisturizer on my feet, though I'm not sure how much the socks themselves absorb. Get dirty pretty easily as anything white would."
3,A quiet collection,"In this collection, American Book Award winner William Bronk write a series of very, very short sharp poems on a variety of subjects. Most of the poems are just two or three lines; a few of them are mildly humorous (""Reality is willing we should think / about it: no harm.""). There are moments of striking beauty: ""Summer is the deepness of trees."" Many of the poems contemplate the meaning of death, and the relationship between man and the deity. These are serious poems, by a poet highly respected if somewhat unknown. While I would not recommend Bronk to anybody just falling in love with poetry, he is a wonderful acquaintance for those who have met the major poets and want a quiet corner to sit in and reflect. Nothing major here, but a nice place to visit."
4,Some Great Ideas!,This book has a lot of really good ideas- many I've never seen. It would be improved with some better photography and a few more related projects. Still- lot's of good ideas.
2,"Given the excitement of his football career, this is a surprisingly dull book","Given the dynamic nature of the football career of Fran Tarkenton, this book is remarkably dull. At least if your interest is the inside nature of football as played by Tarkenton. In many ways, it is more a book about the role of religion in the life of Tarkenton than it is about football. There are no long descriptions of intense moments in a football game, in many ways it reads like a diary. Throughout the book, Tarkenton repeatedly states the depth of his religious faith, including praying for divine guidance at a critical point in a game.There is an insert called ""Tips on Quarterbacking"", eight pages of photos with captions that are designed to help the budding quarterback play the game better. However, they are of limited value, it appears that the section was included more as a selling gimmick rather than a serious attempt to teach football."
5,True Class Act,Bobbi was such a blessing to hear i found her CD in Minnesota and i lost it im so glad that Amazon had it i feel like i found a good friend if you love good Jazz you'll love Bobbi i wish she had more recordings true Classic.
3,Interesting mystery with stock elements,"WotR was not a great book, but it was a good one. The first 3 quarters moved quickly, but the story broke down when the killer was slllooowwwlllyyy revealed. Plus, it was not who I thought it would be."
1,Not recommended for Karaoke or vocals,"This is the same mic that is included with Shure 100WD microphone sytem. The only additional item in the 100WD is a desktop stand. So if you don't care for a desktop stand, go for the cheaper 8900.I bought the 00WD for Karaoke and vocals, and was much disappointed by the extreme sensitivity of the mic handle and wires. If your fingers moved even a bit (without tapping too and far away from the mouth piece), the noise would be heard. Definitely poor quality mic if you want to hold it in your hand and sing. Much disappointed.If you want to leave it on a stand, you could consider it as long as the wire is not touched at all.I returned my piece back to Amazon, and am back in the market looking for a better value for money."
2,This microphone do not work well with my sound card,"I bought the mic in the hope to record quality sound on my computer. However, I have to turn the volume and the level of mic both to the maximum in order to produce a decent loudness on my speaker system.My sound card is SoundBlaster Audigy 2 ZS Notebook. I used my computer's built-in sound card to test it, too, and the result is the same: the output from the mic is too weak."
2,A very misleading CD,"Do you people know that this CD has been tampered with? I mean, the sound and balance are manipulated in such a way as to make Alagna's voice sound much bigger than it really is. The balance is skewed so that both Alagna's voice and the orchestra sound much more powerful than in real life. There are numerous splicing instances and other studio tricks present in this CD. This is NOT an accurate representation of how Alagna sounds in person.Shame on EMI for using all these fake tricks to fool the listener. I, for one, am NOT fooled."
3,love or hate it,"I found this on a recommended shelf of a bookstore I frequent. It wasn't one I would recommend, nor one I would avoid. There were stretches in the story I was really drawn in, but it never became one 'I just couldn't put down'... which I did a couple times reading something else instead, but I did come back to the novel after a while wanting to know a little more of what was going on and what had gone on.There is a current story, and a history that is also being revealled that is the imputus of the current story, and that worked for me. I just didn't have an attachment to the main character. Other readers DID."
4,One Intense Ride,"Run, do not walk, to your nearest bookstore and buy this bookIf you like action packed adventure and an intense interplay between personalities, geography and plot then you will find this a fine book as your ride a whirlwind of story telling that involves you in systems and power structures beyond your ability to control.A complicated, aggressive and risk-taking woman is drawn into an intricate plot that spans three continents, involves people willing to kill and a foreign culture in Thailand impenetrable by traditional western patterns.Francine Mathews worked for the CIA and has carried some of that knowledge with her as she develops exciting, dynamic ways of imagining a world and telling us about it. I hope she has a long career of writing novels and I look forward to her next one."
5,all-star cast,"This recording is exactly what you would expect from an all-star cast.Owners of the Schirmer piano score, watch out for cuts from page 44 to 48, 76 to 80, and 106 to 107. The endings of bth acts are also different."
1,Ugly voice.....,"Whew! Callas had little voice when she recorded this Norma. The timbre is so metallic (rusty metallic) that she is unlistenable. A winter wind across broken, rusty barbed wire. Get her 1952 Covent Garden Norma, out on EMI. That is the best Norma around."
4,compelling Norma,"Maria Callas in what was arguably her greatest role - thisis her second studio recording of Norma made in 1960 andthough only 37 at the time there are undeniable signs ofvocal wear yet that inimitable sound of hers so distinctiveand penetrating and her unique way with words and music makefor a highly compelling performance. The casting of ChristaLudwig as Adalgisa seems a bit wild but it works wonderfullywell - she brings considerable warmth to the role and blendsbeautifully with Callas in their duets. Franco Corelli is adashing Pollione - his last act duet with Callas ""In mia man""is hair-raising. Nicola Zaccaria is a noble Oroveso. The scoreis masterly conducted by veteran Maestro Tulio Serafin and thesound is excellent."
5,Callas at her dramatic best,"When you hear this recording of Callas' Norma and compare it to her previous one (with Stignani and Filipeschi), two things stand out: this performance's stronger cast and Callas' growth in the role. Even though you can feel she's not what she used to be vocally speaking she feels the part with such grandeur that you can excuse the mishaps. Caballe's and Sutherland's Normas are beautiful but I must confess that only Callas can move you with her innate dramatic sense and that special coloring she puts into each word. And to be very honest, if she abuses the chest register I don't mind. I think it gives depth and dramatism to what other singers, in their properly stylistic way, would just beautifully sing, forgetting that opera is and can be drama."
5,CALLAS LA DIVA REIGNS SUPREME,"When I first heard this recording I was spellbounded. It was my second time that I heard Callas, the first being ""La Gioconda"". What a difference in her two portrayals! Here, Norma is presented as being a woman of a noble nature, presented first in the aria ""Casta Diva"". The voice here is more eloquent and more subtle, if one can use such a term, than in the ""Norma"" recording of 1953. There the Callas' voice was purerer, but it lacked the subltelty of the voice in this recording. Also, by this time Callas had grasped the dramatic nuances of the role. In my judgement, Callas sounds better here than in her earlier recording."
5,Ecco un artista,"What is an artist? The answers are countless. To me Callas is one of the supreme artists in operatic history along with Caruso, Ponselle, Flagstad, young Sutherland and many more. Norma was the role Callas sang until the end, the role she loved most. And it all comes to life here in this very good stereo recording. This shouldn't be the only Norma to get, I'd suggest a live recording with young Callas + a Sutherland-recording and the live-recording with Sills and Woolf in addition to this sparkling set. A great treasure indeed."
5,She still owns the role,"I wonder how there can ever be a doubt on the fact leading singers like Caballe, Sutherland and Sills readily admitted, that Norma still belongs to Callas. Sills in particular praised Callas' Norma and mentioned her as a role-model for her own take on the druid-priestess. All in all this recording has the best all around cast in the unsurpassable Callas, the brilliant Pollione of Corelli and the lush Adalgisa of Christa Ludwig. Serafin still rules Bellini! The only Norma to buy is Callas!"
3,Christmas vacation!,"I purchased this CD because of the Christmas vacation song by Mavis Staples. This is the theme song to my favorite christmas movie with the same title with Chevy Chase. The rest of the album is O.K....wish the CD case had not arrived cracked...I had to pry out the CD and the case is ruined. The CD, though, played Christmas vacation perfectly and I was able to transfer to my IPOD for my christmas party mix!"
2,Ok CD,"I only bought this CD because I wanted one song off it. The rest of the tracks are ok, nothing spectacular."
5,Great Book,I Enjoyed this Book but Lists aren't Important.Cuz you can never say who would rule any given Time Period.I think all People Selected are Winners.of Course their are some who didn't make the list and therefor they should be acknowledged as well.
1,Great track listing. but..................,"The track listing on this is really great.Brian Setzer and the Tomcats (whom later became the Straycats) at their early rockabilly origins.The reality of being a `live' and truly `live' recording is somewhat disappointing.The disappointment is the poor sound recording quality.The tracks sound like the recording microphone was positioned a very long way back from the origin of sound.It has the quality of pure bootleg. The sound is hollow/empty and contains people talking, cheering and clapping.I tweaked and twiddled both on iTunes and on a sound deck but to no avail. (Sorry Brian, fan or nay fan I cannae listen to this laddie).My advise is: if you want to listen to what should be amazing tracks choose another media.If you are a purist and a huge Setzer/Tomcats fan then maybe you could listen to this?????????????"
3,Not Her Best,"Laurie Colwin's Shine On, Bright and Dangerous Object, is a slight book [181 pages] with a split personality.Elizabeth (Olly) Bax is a twenty-seven-year-old widow. Her husband, Sam, was a charming daredevil who one day paid his dues - permanently. Olly grieves, coping with the warmth and awkwardness of family ties and tries to re-establish her own life.Olly comes to realize that her own risks are just as daring as Sam's - he risked his life and she is willing to risk her heart -and she again finds herself and love - but in a surprising place.This is a flawed book. It falls into two uneven parts that I had a great deal of difficulty with. On the other hand, it was refreshingly different and the characters were interesting. But either I was having a 'slow' day or some of the sentences were a bit difficult to understand. I found myself re-reading some passages wondering what the author meant."
2,Maybe a good book for a breeder,"I was disappointed with this book. Half the book has endless lists of champions in other countries and the USA. There is a short, but thorough, section on grooming. I would have enjoyed more anecdotes and pictures."
5,My favorite NIN Remix CD,"I approached this CD tentatively, because I own nearly all the NIN remix CD's, but rarely find myself listening to more than 1 or two songs per CD. However, as soon as I put this CD in, I was able to listen to it straight, through, much as I would any of the main halo releases. I admit that I am a bit biased towards the main releases, but with my surprise enjoyment of Things Falling Apart, I think I will find myself eagerly re-listening to the past remixes. Things Falling Apart presents no new material, but rather every song is a direct descendent of one on the Fragile. I like the decision to keep the CD this way because it presents a fully understandable companion to the Fragile. I am not incredibly fond of the fact that ""Starf**kers, Inc"" was remixed three times on a single CD, I enjoy the remixes, but they weren't my favorites."
5,more music for fans from one of the best albums in YEARS,"if you're a nine inch nails fan and love ""fixed"" and ""further down the spiral,"" this is for you ....... I devoured ""The Fragile"" when it came out, and was in awe of its melodic and emotional range. This CD's versions of the songs are--some more interesting, some better, softer....louder, .......more, more, more. The remix halos are like methadone, holding NIN fans over til the next release. Thanks for the fix.Can't wait for the fragility tour DVD......"
4,"Good, not great, good","This is a good solid CD. Some good songs remixed and some new ones. If you are a hardcore NIN fan you will like this CD, if not I don't know what to say. My favorite track is the last Starf**kers remix, track 10. Nice and original sound that makes it seem like an entirely new song. One thing about this CD is that it grows on you, you might skip some songs when you first play it but after a while you start to like some songs and listen to the CD from begining to end."
3,A good collection of remixes plus,"Things falling apart has good remixes like the Wretched, The Frail with agreat violin solo Star fs track 6.10 miles high. The last version of star fs is fair, Idont like star fs track 4 video game noise. Starfs track 6 has different styles and is better than the original. the first two songs are good. The fragile is great and The Frail, The wretched, and Starfs track 6. add something by making these 3 better plus Metal is real good."
4,great remix album but....,"I am not a real fanatic of any remix release but I must say that this is by far the best from NIN, in some perspective it's even better than The Fragile, but... I didn't like the fact that they had 3 Starf*****'s tracks, that's WAY too much, not to mention they all sucked anyway haha, but, overall it was great especially the Slipping Away, and 10 Miles High, but anyhow I hate to say this but I can't help but think that... Matthew Cooke character, in my view is obviously one of those ""N'stink.... uhhh I mean N'sync trendy teeny-bopper type of person"" sorry Matt but not all of us are like you.... anyway, later ya'll!!!"
2,Nine Inch Nails can actually be laughed at with this one,"This is the worse album for any goth/rock group. Trent is a very intelligent and respected artist of his time but he overdid his work with the remixes. Either he wanted more money or actually thought this piece of work was going to be worthy. Its depressing to just think some songs from a great album such as ""Fragile"" was remixed into TECHNO wanna-be Moby songs.This album is one of those that you listen to you want to end as soon as possible because it is just irritating noise. The music that was once taken seriously can now be a club joke. The only reason why I gave this one a two was, ONE for the album art, and TWO, for Trent's time taken into this irritating album."
1,Things Falling Apart? Trent Reznor's career,"I can't believe I shelled out another 10 bucks for this cd. I should have learned my lesson when I was robbed of 20bucks for ""the fragile"" Do yourself a favor and slap yourself for even considering buying this CD."
3,Nine Inch Nails Isn't The Same Band Anymore,Trent Reznor & Chris Vrenna need to put there differences behind them and just get back to making music together again!! After Chris left the band the whole sound changed for the worse. It's hard to believe how important he was to the overall sound of each nine inch nails record.
2,Doesn't wear well,"Both my daughter and I went through several of these before we gave up and switched to a different style and different brand of outdoor key security. In every case (5 or 6) the mechanism froze up and the bottom wouldn't come open. It is well-designed as far as appearance goes, but reliability is a real problem."
4,HD LCD TV,Didn't appear that I made the right choice when I first installed it out the box. But after a few adjustments I've been very pleased ever sense.Great TV for the price.
1,Toshiba not backing up there products,"The first thing I want to make clear is this has nothing to do with amazon, just Toshiba itself. In trying to get a product repaired, looked at, or customer service this has to be one of the worse companies I have ever dealt with. I WILL NEVER buy another Toshiba product again. Since I am a business owner myself I have dealt with a number of products and businesses myself and I would never deal mith my customers this way. So long TOshiba I will not buy from you guys again."
4,Outstanding,"I purchased this item based on reviews from this and other sites. I was impressed with the ease of set up and the features the remote provides. But, what really impressed me is the picture quality in HD. I am a hockey fan and was always disappointed with TV coverage. It was like two differant sports, but with HD it is as close as being there as possible. The thing the ""blew"" my mind is that you could see the light refelecting off of the ice.The only thing close to a negative, is the blurring of fringe elements, when the camera pans fast. I understand that this is a problem with HD period."
2,Screen losing clarity,This was my first flat screen TV. Initially it worked very well. After a couple years some lines started to develop that interfere with the picture. They run vertically from the bottom of the screen up. It is more of a shadow effect that interferes with the picture quality.
4,LCD tv,"Good flat screen for the money in the day. You can do better now. If in doubt, size up rather than down."
2,Bad selection,I bought this tv on 11/24/2006. It is now 09/15/2008 and the tv is broken with a repair estimate of 900.00 plus labor. Sorry I listened to consumer report.
3,Make sure you get Extended Warranty,Shortly after 1-year display has a fine dark line on right side in displays over 480 res. Think the line is a burn-in of the right edge of the 480 window. Other than line everything else is great. Priced a replacement display cost is as much as I paid for set.
5,Study Guide as ordered.,"The study guide I got was in great shape. It said it was used, but didn't look like it. I would buy from this seller again."
1,Not so great 60's hit reprise,I too have purchased this disc in hopes of acquiring the ORIGINAL recording. This is the right band but a mediocre reprise of their classic song. I have yet to find the original 96 tears on any collection.
1,Save Your Money,"If you loved the original ""96 Tears"" and ""I Need Somebody"" don't put yourself through the disappointment of listening to this CD. I read someplace that we may never hear the ""real"" versions as the original music has been tied up in litigation for years. Wish I still had all my old records..."
4,Question Mark & The Mysterians - self-titled (Collectables),"Good sixteen track compilation of this late '60's garage rock one-hit wonder. Realize these aren't the 'original' versions, but they're acceptable, as reworkings of QM&TM'S better cuts. Since some of those no-life record companies REFUSE to authorize the legit release of the band's original recordings, we have to settle for these. But, relax. Actually all 16 of these tunes sound fine, I thought. Tunes I liked best were ""96 Tears"", the swinging ""Midnight Hour"", ""8' Teen"", ""Go To"", ""Don't Break This Heart Of Mine"", the uplifting ""You're Telling Me Lies"" and ""Make You Mine"". Should draw in fans of 13th Floor Elevators, The Outcasts, Trashmen and Human Beinz. A should-have."
2,To Cry For,"This album is to cry for.I have the original album...I love 96Tears, Plase Don't Tease Me, UN Sides and other in the original album that are not in the one you are selling.I will call this a cheap imitation of a masterpiece. Thank god i still have the original. I will now record it on a CD to save it."
1,"The ORIGINAL ""96 Tears"" is STILL absent!","For some reason, Allen Klein of ABKCO has STILL not released the original Cameo-Parkway masters, so all we STILL get are these horrible re-recordings of great songs like ? and the Mysterians' ""96 Tears"". Fortunately for me, I've got ""96 Tears"" on vinyl to enjoy."
1,One Hit Wonder,A band with one hit. After listening to the rest of the album you will understand why they only had one.
5,what a sweet garage punk record !,Great mid-sixties tex-mex innocence ! Minimalist bouncing swing! Farfisa! So young and fresh! Don't love them ? hmm? Should try Metallica !
2,Disappointed,"I wanted to be really pleased with this item, because I'm really tired of dealing with wired headsets - those wires really get in my way. The iLuv i202 worked great if I was sitting still, at my desk for example. But when I get up to move around - gardening for example - it would cut out for a few moments until I would move the transmitter.It comes with its own Bluetooth transmitter, which exhibited the above problem behavior. I also tried it with a Jabra music adaptor, a compatible stereo Bluetooth transmitter, and got the same results. Accordingly I would like to think the problem is with the headset, and not with the transmitters.Thankfully Amazon has its liberal return policy, so I returned this item today and am ording something else (the Sony DR BT30QS)."
5,Perfect,Works perfect.Looks Great.Kids love it.No negatives!What's not to love when it's all good news and the grandkids are giving you hugs?
4,Unbelievably cute,"Wish I could give it 5 stars, but purchased as a gift and haven't seen it in action. It is absolutely precious and, if it works correctly, granddaughter will love it and be the hit of the neighborhood this summer. Purchased with Hawaiian shaved ice syrup and extra cups and straws. I'm sure the description gives dimensions, but to get you an idea, I would say it's the size of a small microwave and just as cute as it is pictured."
5,Excellent product,My daughter wanted this so badly for Christmas and i was hesitant on the quality. We made snow cones on Christmas morning and i was impressed with the ease of use and how well the ice turned out. It is just like a snow cone from your favorite fair.
5,Works great!,This snow cone maker works great! I was wanting an ice shaver for Hawaiin type ice but this makes crushed ice the size of little beads instead but we love it anyway. We have used it several times. My daughter begs me to make it for her all the time. You have to rinse the ice off first or let it melt a little in order to get the ice to work.
3,looks and makes great snow cones the first time only.,This was an Xmas gift for the family. Everyone was excited to have some snow cones. We made 5 snow cones and it worked great just a bit loud like other reviews state. I could deal with the noise as long as the machines works good. Later on the same day we decided to make some more and the ice was not shaving. It sounded like the plastic piece that makes it spin for the ice to shave was not gripping. Everyone was disappointed. I am returning it and a replacement one is being sent. I will give this snow cone maker a second chance just in case I just happened to get a defective one. I hope the new one works since we love snow cones. I will update my review once I receive the new one and test it out.
5,Very cute snowcone maker,"My daughters wanted a snowcone maker and got this one because it was cute looking. Got it and it looks just like the picture, makes great snow cones, daughters love it and thats all that matters. I recommend this snowcone maker."
2,Really?,My God-daughters have not opened this product yet but quick question?..... Who the hell ships a snow cone machine in its original box?
1,snow cone maker,When I got the snow cone maker the door was broke and it had a crack down the side not happy but keep it n e ways cause I needed it the day after I recived it or I would've sent it back
3,Loved it till it broke 4 months after use!,"I got this for my sons 11th birthday party, does the job. It was a hit with the kids too! While it isin't super fluffy shaved ice, it's great lil machine, does the job! Yes..I would recommend the product!NOTE: worked great for 3-4 months then the blade broke, sadly I had to throw it away. Be forewarned!"
2,Broke after two months,"I loved this sno cone machine for awhile, then I ended up with a piece of plastic in my mouth. One small piece of plastic had broken off and now the whole machine doesn't work. Bummed. I would say go with a machine that doesn't have gears."
2,Jams with only 1 piece of ice!,"During the making of 4 snow comes the machine would continually jam on pieces of ice. Now it doesn't shave anything and only jams. I let the ice slightly melt until it was clear looking (like the instructions state) but the machine just seems too weak to shave it. I really wanted to like this, especially since it was a Christmas gift for my 4 year old nephew but it just doesn't work!"
4,"Pretty, but not without its flaws","I purchased the Nostalgia SCM-502 Old Fashioned Snow Cone maker over the summer and though at first I thought the noise made by the machine was normal upon closer inspection I realized that one of the pieces was not rotating properly and hence made it impossible for the blades inside the machine to cut the ice and it just got stuck. I looked for the flawed piece and noticed it was the plastic white ring. The one that goes inside the cup with the blades and touches the smaller white cog that makes it spin. Part of the teeth on that removable piece were misshapen and when the machine tried to spin it was breaking the rest of the little teeth. I tried to contact the seller, and I got the piece replaced. The item is beautiful but it feels like it was made out of cheap plastic. I like it a lot,and it works now, but I see a lot of problems in the future."
2,Gears Jam...,"I got this snow cone maker for my daughter for Christmas and she loved it. Made snowcones every day for us for about two weeks. Then it started jamming every time we put ice in it. We tried everything to fix it. Works fine when there is no ice, but when you put ice in it, the inside basket lifts jams the gears. We returned it through Amazon for a replacement with no problem, the next one did the exact same thing. I think it must be a problem with the design (and yes, I did let the ice ""soften"" as the instructions say). We are returning it again, this time for a refund and looking for another brand."
5,Amazing machine and adorable too!,I was so happy I purchased this. If you host a lot of kids parties you'll be happy too. This machine is so adorable. It looks just like the larger old fashioned machines you'd see at carnivals. It works great and is so easy to use. You can get quite a few snow cones if you fill it up with ice. It is a bit loud to operate but can crush the ice very quickly. Two thumbs up!!
4,Happy with it- would make a few modifications though...,"This machine is great for a family machine. It makes fine snow- yep- it's loud- but it's quick. I definitely think it needs some kind of drain/catch pan on the bottom to keep the melted water out of the shaved ice. Also, the idea of having the lip below the door- well you can't really put that much ice in there. I would modify the spoon- so you can actually make the curved tops like they show in the photos. It is just a spoon. Cute idea- wish i had a place to keep it out so we would use it more but it is not a small appliance! kids will love it- i thinnk they will do a snow cone stand this summer- since we ordered tons of flavoring off the internet...little different thean a koolaid stand..."
1,not what it seems,"there are too many plastic gears that make the machine run and you can't do as many snow cones because you have to wait between running it because you can not run it for more than 5 minuets at a time this is the first item I wish I hadn't bought,"
1,Not worth the money.,"We bought this about a year ago, and it has cracked easily since, and today was the last day of it's miserable life when the motor started smoking. Made of cheap plastic, and low quality materials."
5,Saved my daughters first birthday!!!,"Great product! Easy to use, it was 95 degrees and humid at my daughters 1st bday party, this snow cone machine was used for 2 hours straight making perfect cones with store bought ice. It was a great hit!!! Cant wait to use it again!!"
5,A big hit with the kids ...and adults too!,I had my son's birthday party last month and this one was a big hit. Kind of noisy but works what it's intended for. Love it!
4,The Reagans,"The movie was wonderful. James Brolin created an incredible President Reagan, but Judy Davis was a poor choice as Nancy. She not only didn't look anything like Nancy, her presentation was too weak and winey."
5,wonderful,"This movie came to us in great condition. The Truth of the matter is, we were amazed at the great quality."
1,Not worth the time.,Pretty obvious that this is Democratic propaganda. What a waste of time. All one needs to do is look at the cast and you know where this will end up.
1,Good but not good enough,"If you are a student interested in acting, then I suggest that you watch this movie because the actors did a fairly good job in a difficult protrayal of such famous figures. However, if you are a history student looking for some insight into the Reagans, then this film is not for you. I recommend that you read ""Ronald Reagan: An American Life"" written by the former president which provides more information concerning the thoughts and policies of the president. Even though the book is an autobiography, Mr. Reagan does not whitewash any of his mistakes, and you will come to understand why he was one of America's most popular presidents."
3,James Brolin in a Reagan Mask,"The film was not as bad as I expected from the reviews, except that James Brolin looked like he was wearing a Ronald Reagan smiling mask. If one were to take any single still frame out of the film it would look like Reagan. If you listened to the voice, it would sound like Reagan. However, Brolin lacked the life and expressions of the real Ronald Reagan. The real Reagan captivated audiences. Brolin seems flat and empty.The film is limited in time and cannot cover all the facts, but at times issues were raised without fully addressing them. For instance, the film raised the issue of Reagan saying he had seen the holocaust while his advisors note that Reagan never left the US during the war. They don't tell you that Reagan saw some of the first pictures of holocaust victims because of his role in making films for the war.Over all, it was an interesting film, but the flat emptiness in Brolin's presentation of Reagan was a big disappointment."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"No wonder this movie has made it into the classroom video collections of lazy and liberal high school history teachers.I watched it with my son, as it was a ""project"" he had to complete. Because it does not out-rightly slam Reagan as evil, I don't think leftists will even like it much.At best it is a Hollywood soap-opera rendition of Reagan's family life. Admittedly it IS called The Reagans ... with an ""s"".Don't expect to find any clues to Reagan's convictions on leaving the Democrat Party and joining the Republicans. Nor will you find any mention of his sincere Christian beliefs which led him to conclude that Communism, both in the USSR and in the USA, were evil. The movie depicts him as a bumbling puppet, instead of the greatest modern day president that he was.For a much better portrayal of the life experiences and convictions that made Reagan great, I suggest the DVD:In the Face of Evil - Reagan's War in Word and Deed."
4,What's the controversy for?,"I went into this having a somewhat negative view of Reagan and a neutral opinion of his wife. I was quite surprised to find that it changed my opinion of Reagan for the better. Nancy, however, definitely comes off the worse. The portrayals all seem very honest and reasonable and the controversy surrounding it seems misplaced. In fact, all the hub-bub sourrounding this movie feels much more like an attempt to make sure the public only remembers the good things in Reagan's administration. Bottom-line, I would recommend this movie for what it is; a very good depiction of the events and a sometimes exaggerated depiction of the people in Reagan's life. Like the movie says, the roles are presented as a composite."
5,Delightful And Uplifting,"The vocals, instrumentation, and interpretation of the devotional chants on 'The Love Window' are delightful. Besides just listening to this CD is also great for singing along for joy or private worship. The chants are easy to follow, with the lyrics provided in the insert."
3,Quality of the recording is disappointing,"I recently went to a Shantala live performance and bought 3 of their CDs afterwards, with this being one of them. I have to say after I listened to it, I feel the CD does not do justice to Heather's voice. While in the concert, her voice was strong and crystal clear. It embodied such powerful emotions that it enveloped me completely. The CD, however, sounded like it was done in a tunnel, with the voices muffled and echoy. I guess it's an issue of mixing, perhaps too much reverb. I would look for their other CDs in the future but I just can't listen to this one."
5,foundational,WOW! What a great book. What great Lessons. God has truly used Josh McDowell and given him a heart for children. The book grabs the very core of what children need today....an understanding that there really is an ABSOLUTE TRUTH. The children learned how to put biblical principals into action. Every week there was another testimony from one of the students. The learnd how to make right decisions using Gods Word. This will actually be our second time putting this book into action and I am even more excited than before. Truth Works is a must for anyone trying to reach the hearts and minds of our children for Christ.
2,A good try,Caruso tries to make an argument for the feminist issues in the works of Flannery O'Connor. This is a tough sell because O'Connor herself said this was not the point she was trying to make. Her stories are about redemption one's need for that doesn't change based on gender or sex.
3,"Ok, but not great Map of Bangkok","We bought this map to use on our vacation in Thailand. It has all of the streets on it, however, it's printed in such a way that it's difficult to read. We ended up using the maps they give to tourists, and the GPS on our phone instead of this map."
1,Dissapointing,"The first book was pretty good, but the second book... what a dissapointment. I mean, the heroine goes mad and stops believing her friends exist. Then, when she becomes most annoying, she turns into a goddess. Also, the ""bad-guy"" turns out not to be that evil. I mean, seriously! Make the trickster go all soft and emotional over some jerk psycologist- how nice. NOT! I would not reccomend this book at ALL!I forgot to mention- Vihena the honor obsessive tries to kill my favorite character- the mute girl."
4,Relatable and sympathetic,"Relatable and sympathetic, this memoir of a nervous guy becoming a nervous father is worth the read for any father (or mother) who has ever looked at their beautiful newborn infant and thought, ""What the hell do I do now?""For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal."
4,The book I wish I'd had getting ready to be a dad,"A great, easy read. Always honest. Sometimes funny. Sometimes crass. Really great. Wish I'd had this book when i was getting ready to be a dad myself, and getting stressed out by all the by-moms-for-moms baby books piling up in our house that just didn't help. The thing I enjoyed most reading this book as a dad of two under four - and probably would have enjoyed most when I was getting ready is that it is not advice, not tips, not tactics or overwhelming details about babies and their developmental milestones and needs. It is just clear, honest stories - so easy to picture one dad bungling his way through it all; and by extension to picture yourself doing the same in the not too distant future. Highly recommended for the dad to be. More reflections on the book on my [...] blog: [...]"
5,"Very witty, recommended quick read","This author combines his ideas and fears of fatherhood into an accessible, witty and humerous collection of anecdotal short stories."
3,"Too short, too bland","Each chapter is an anecdote from his girl's first year. It was interesting to read about someone else's perspective on this sort of life event, especially someone with such a non-standard lifestyle. However, the narrative wasn't very evocative of any kind of emotion. I doubt I'd read anything else from this author."
2,"More annoying than ""poignant""?","I'm a new dad and received this title as a gift from a friend--thinking I might see ""myself"" in the book. My wife and I live and work in the Bay Area (the setting for the book), both hold down jobs (cost of living is outrageous here) and often feel utterly overwhelmed by trying integrate a new child into our lives and still make ends meet. I would give anything to have nothing more to do for an entire year than schleep my child down to Royal Grounds in the BabyBjorn every morning to people-watch and then go home to watch SportsCenter and eat PBJs. After a few chapters I wondered: ""When does this guy go to work? And who's paying for those dinners at Chez Panisse?"" This is not my reality at all nor of any parent I know. And that peeing in a cup business is just gross."
4,Sertous sci-fi,"Hutch is a very appealing character and the world created is a hopeful view of a future we might inherit. She is the type of woman that we see more often today, but still too rarely. Tightly written and consistent, it is the sort of sci-fi to bring you back for more. -ms"
2,Disappointing...,"I've read all of McDevitt's books... and find this one to be by far the least appealing. It'd be an OK book by someone else, but I expect more from McDevitt. It reads too much like a movie script (and would probably make a good movie) and fails to have the depth of character and science demonstrated in books such as: Engines of God, Infinity Beach and Ancient Shores."
3,Cliff Notes McDevitt,"Deepsix contains all of the elements of a great Jack McDevitt book: A central mystery concerning non-human intelligence, well realized characters that you care for, and a fascinating background Universe. My problem with the book, is that it felt like the author was just going through the motions constucting the outline of a more engaging book that he ran out of time to complete (Damn those deadlines!). I've read all of his books starting with The Hercules Text, and the man can tell a tale! Unfortunately, this effort doesn't rank with his best, but any McDevitt is better than most of the stuff out there!"
2,"Good Book, Bad Kindle Edition","This one book I truly enjoyed by the author. My issue is with Kindle. I do not know what they used to make the book into a digital book, but there are too many typo's, nonesense lines, and missed punctuation at key points that seriously detract form the reading pleasure. Such as the word ""die"" that shows up numerous times where the word 'the"" should be. A whole sentence turned nonsense in a critical juncture. Substitutions of letters such as ""fail"" for ""fall"". Get a proof reader. The way this digital book was put together suggests it was done too quickly and without good editing. Definitely not worth the $8.99 kindle charges. Buy the print edition."
3,Could have been better.,"The first half was wonderful for me. The second half was more of a labor. Too many unbelievable 'Hollywood Action Flic' style scenes, and too many characters. At times you weren't sure which character he was talking about.I wanted more about the planet and the adventure. I wanted more about the main characters. I was left wanting more from this book."
3,Book was OK,"Book was ok, would wait for the paperback. It's very similar to his book Engines of the Gods - lot of the same characters, same pace, even refers to events in previous book."
4,What? You still aren't sure if you want it?,"Hey, you with the bored expression on your face! Ya, you. This book, if you choose to read it, could really liven up your day. I loved it. Why shouldn't you? I especially liked the end. It cleared things up nicely but still allowed space for speculation. Mr. McDevitt wrote it perfectly, I'd say. He scribbled a thriller, then threw in bits of humerous releif here and there. Try it, you'll like it."
2,Not recommended for any self respecting woman,"I, myself, have always been a very open minded and avid sci-fi reader. When I stumbled across Deepsix I was impressed to read that the leading character was a female. While I am a woman I'm in no way obsessed with feminism but the character of Hutch in this book is such a terribly unrealistic and sexist depiction of women that I was absolutely baffled. The character was obviously written and developed by a man and this shows quite obviously throughout the books. Aside from my dissapointment with ALL of the female characters (not just Hutch), the story itsself was relatively interesting but very slow and anticlimactic. I don't recommend this series for women at all based on the character, but I don't recommend this book for anyone of ANY gender due to it's poor plot and slow pace."
2,to much noise,"I bought this dvd because I like Cuban music, ryhthems and dance. But this dvd was just music and no dance. It was a loud motonous Cuban hip hop style. Not for me! It was a concert somewhere. I watched two acts, and then turned it off."
3,Seemed like there should have been a third book that never came,Seemed like there should have been a third book that never came. It would have been nice to have a book that tied the first two together. I enjoyed both books otherwise.
1,"Great Film, but NO original language track.","Grrr.If you like Keita Amemiya films( Moon over tao, Hakaider, Cyber Ninja, Zeiram2, Mikazuki) Steer clear of Fox Lorbers featureless grab at your wallet.Grrr."
3,zeram review,effects-laden japenese sci-fi flick about two peoplepeople working for a power company come across a device that leads them to another dimension ruled by monsters and must help a alien crime fighter stop them. winner of the 1991 tokyo film festavle.
4,orgiastic reading,"One of the great things about this book is that is manages to illuminate things that you see in the media everyday, think ""that's strange,"" but can't quite put your finger on what's going on. This book deals with weird cults, millenial anxieties, apocalyptic movies, and the technophobic atmosphere of the early 21st century. As the blurb says ""I listened to a fine storyteller interpret and draw attention to important practices taking place at the present.""Recommended!"
1,"I, Pretentious","The most difficult works to endure are those in which the author is desperately trying to prove his genious. Flowery language is used to mask simple ideas and depth of thought is substituted with random comparative excess. I would not find it shocking if the other reviews herein were actually written by the author, as they are just the type of ego indulgence i would expect from Pettman. Ironically, the book may be a more apt example of millenial anticlimax than an expository piece about it. Infused with regurgitated, often dated discourse, the work is pedantic, forcing you ponder the opportunity costs of reading Pettman, rather than thinking about his ideas. I'm not impressed."
1,quickly dated and trivial,"After I read this pretentious tome, I became depressed. I thought about how many contemporary intellectuals are lost in a sea of theory, popular culture, and self-absobtion. This book, seeking to be epic cultural criticism, is a mishmash of postmodern theorists that seems starkly disconnected from the zeitgeist it's attempting to portray.If you wish to read significant cultural criticism, I suggest Paul Berman's book ""Terror And Liberalism""- a work that is both urgent and sophisticated cultural analysis."
4,Good blend of story and technical,Bill Clarke's book on the C150 series is a good overview of the history of the development of the aircraft and the events that lead up to it. There is a reasonable amount of technical detail but somewhat lacking if you really want nuts and bolts kind of information. Overall this book is brings a good knowledge base for the serious enthusiast.
4,Good CD,An excellent release by Elvis Martinez.He has a fine voice for bachata music.He is nice indeed!
3,The 1960s Headstones from Texas!,"I don't know what to say about 2 out of the 3 other reviews for this that have a completely different band in mind! This is the '60s garage/heavy rock band from Texas and not the modern rawk band from Canada.As for the music, this one is kind of hit and miss. The first four tracks are downright moody garage punk gems, on par with the other gazillion great bands of the Pebbles-era. But I'm not sure if there's enough good songs to make this a top priority unless you're an absolute nerd for this stuff like I am! Next comes a few marginal quality live tracks with the band covering the 13th Fl.Elevators, Chambers Bros. and a few others. The rest of the CD, another 10 tracks, finds the Headstones in a different era and sound. These songs are heavy stoner rock from the late 60s/early 70s. Actually, these tracks are pretty good and will make this CD more appealing to fans of later-era '60s heavy psych.Again, pretty darn good, but only for serious fans of the genre."
4,"Good Phone, one problem",The sound and the message system is very good. The only problem I have had is that the headset is easly knock out of the holder. This is a problem because the phone is on a night stand
1,Stay away from this one. Far away.,"It serves me right for buying the cheapest one. The out-going message is nearly inaudible, no matter how close I get my face to the microphone or how loudly I speak. Poorly translated operating instructions made figuring out how to set the time, record the out-going message, and play back received messages take more than an hour. Even then, we have a new message that will not play - only the third message we've received on this phone. Receiver crackles as if this phone were thirty years old with a loose cord rather than brand-new. Never, NEVER buy a Coby product. Ever."
1,Not a good buy,This item was a piece of junk. Could not get the toll saver to work. We like to have our answering machine pick up after 2 rings. Instructions were very unclear. We sent it back after 2 days. Save your time and money and don't buy this. The only reason I gave it one star is because there's not a 0 on the list.
1,A very cheap machine that lives up to its price.,"It's made of lightweight plastic and is spare in its features. At least I think so because the very worst thing about this Coby product is the user guide, er, uh, user pamphlet, er uh, folded thingy written in broken Chinese that makes it agonizingly difficult to set up and immediately clear that you have made a mistake. I suspect you will see a lot of these things in job lot or 99cents stores. The most pleasure I got from it was throwing it in the garbage after buying a way superior UNIDEN."

1,Another Clone band putting out an album,The outsiders were a great band. Mostly because of the great singing of the leader Sonny Geraci. (later of Climax) He is NOT on this album automatically negating it. The fact that they play Precious and Few (A CLIMAX SONG NO LESS) is only attributed to the fact that Walt Nims (songwriter of the song) is in the band for this concert.This is an awful attempt to cash in on a 4 hit wonder's earlier successes. Buy the best of or buy a Sonny Geraci live album (on his website www.sonnygeraci.com) at least then the SINGER of the hit songs is singing the songs HE made famous with HIS voice.
3,An Outsiders fan,"Anyone who is an Outsiders fan knows that most of these songs are culled from some of the best of their singles and some were just good album cuts like ""Wine, Wine, Wine"" off of their second album. It is regrettable that Sonny Geraci is not with them but it is great to hear that the spacey organ part still predominates(one of my favorite parts of 60's music). My only question is where is the song ""HAUNTED BY YOUR LOVE"" from the 3rd album ""IN"". C'mon Outsiders.....give us that sneering, incindiary anthem live."
2,Arrived Damaged,"I ordered this compressor based on the reputation of Porter Cable. I liked the output of it compared to other brands of the same size. It actually had higher output ratings than larger models of other brands. Unfortunately, my compressor arrived damaged. The flimsy cardboard box from the factory provided very little protection. The output tube from the motor to the tank was crushed, the cover on the motor was cracked and had a golf ball size hole in it, the head had a broken cooling fin, and the lower tank support was bent. I was looking forward to owning this compressor but I will be sending it back for a refund. I will not be ordering another one due to packaging. If you get one that is not damaged I am sure it would be a great compressor."
3,"More Salsa, Please!","I like this cd. That Hawaiian stuff at the beginning of Sueno paraiso sounds really cool. Sueno paraiso has alot of good latin grooves. I gotta say, for a group called Salsa Hawaii I was kind of expecting more salsa than just on the first song. My favorite songs are Todo todo, Que bonito, and All day music. Rolando's lead singer Cynthia Romero really belts out her songs hard. She is really a great singer! Then she does that Que bonito song and just melts everybody in the room with that voice. Then they do a really good version of All day music. Rolando sounds really good on that one. I like this version better than the original version. Nice going. Like I said, this is a good cd. If you make another cd, try to play some more salsa for us, please!"
5,simply lovely,"This recording has quickly become one the favorites in my Christmas collection. It is a serene, yet stirring piece."
4,Great but 1 flaw,"My husband adores this CD. I got it for him as a gift and I enjoy it as well. The mood, the history, the religion all combine to evoke deep sentiment.I am not technical about music so I'm probably not describing this correctly but there is a flaw in the recording that is unfortunate. At a few really loud points, all you hear is static. My husband said this was because of inadeqaute recording equipment? Nevertheless, we're not one bit sorry we bought it."
2,so so,"it does the job what it for , but I still find my original HP holster better as out of that I never had my pocket PC fell down, which happend with it as I opened it it turned upside down, so I discontinued using it."
2,Not really that great,"The case cover (inside that holds the phone) is positioned about 1/4 of an inch (+/-) too low. This in turn obstructs the answer/hangup buttons, the power button and the speaker, making it difficult power on/off, answer/hangup and to hear converstations. Spend your money else where. On a good note, I love the credit card and SD card holders. I'll probably use this for a while."
4,"6515 case, it's okay for the money",the case is and does exactly what it is suppose to. It is not the hightest quality leather when compared to some of my other cases for other PPC's and phones. Overall it is a good case quality workmanship and sized right.
2,Krusell Handit Multidapt,Good looking case but is not practical. It'll help using velcro or a magnet to close instead of the clip button the used.
3,case,"I paid ~ $10 for this and would not pay anymore. i have seen them for sale for as high as $40. IMO not really worth it because of the keyboard cover, the plastic wears out fairly quickly and then you can read the letters. the keyboard should have been left open."
3,Does most of the job,"The item works as described, and I was able to add an aftermarket stereo to my 2005 Malibu Maxx. I can control all of the computer functions that used to be on my factory stereo.Installation instructions were not very good, so I found some better ones online.My only complaint is the temperature reading. It's fine during the summer, but in the winter when the temp is below 30f, the display shows random numbers. I contacted Scosche, and they told me that they were aware of the issue, and that the GM1593B has been discontinued. In other words, tough luck.If you're looking for an alternative, I would recommend the Metra 99-3303."
1,Beware,"This text has several problems:1. Beware the redundancy and the small nuances of incorrectness. Certain information is not specific nor entirely accurate.2. Beware the tediousness. It takes a LONG time to get through the projects, especially if one is experienced with the program all together.3. Watch out for instructors who will use this book but have little computer experience. They are usually unable to follow the complicated instructions and it can be frustrating to both students and the instructor.4. And just for those of us who have been using computers since they were born; it's rather easy to not have to read the instructions for projects once one gets the hang of it. Also, the finished product pictures inappropriately at the start of each unit help as well."
1,Very flawed office book,I was sad to receive my copy of this text and have it filled with so many flaws. I think they were trying to copy another publisher's author team in writing this but they seemed to have missed the mark.I considered this for a college class in which I teach Office but would not think of subjecting my students to the current version of this text.
5,Excellent Text,I am a student who is using this book this term. It is fantastic. I am learning the skills needed for my job and find it very easy to follow. I am hoping in my advanced Excel course they use the same text.
2,Not impressed,This shampoo takes a while to work. Don't be surprised if you don't have a snowy white dog the first time around. I used it on my white toy poodle and he still has some staining after the 5th bath. (After following directions exactly for each bath)The staining on his fur does look better - but I think a few of the people writing reviews on this product are over exaggerating a bit if they tell you it's perfect thing for whiting your dog. Let's just say it helps... but it's not a miracle worker!
5,"2-3 years later, still wearing them!","I love, love, love these sandals! Seriously, I have had them for a couple years now and I still love them just as much as I did when I got them. The wedge makes these so comfortable you can wear them far longer than typical heels. I love them with jeans, shorts and dresses, pretty much anything. Very durable as well. I honestly cannot say anything bad about them, I just hope they last me a few more years!"
2,fake leather...,"I loved the way these sandals looked so I ordered them right away. Could'nt wait to get them and was happy when I tried them on. I read the other reviews and decided to order the 8. I typically wear a 7-7 1/2. The 8 did fit good (other reviews wrote that the shoe runs small). On better inspection I realized that these sandals are not real leather! The inside of the top of the sandal even has written ""made in Brazil"" and ""leather upper"". Soooo not true. I gave this shoe 2 stars because I know that it won't stretch and mold to my foot like real leather would. Also I'm dissapointed because this is blatent false representation of a decent brand. If it's fake then sell it as a ""faux"" leather. Some people would buy it anyway for the price. But to be decieved is unfair to the consumer. This makes me feel leary. I'll be sending these back or selling them at a yard sale. Extremely dissapointed!"
5,Wonderfull,"I can't believe how beatifull this sandals are and to my suprise they look grate with a lot of my trousers, although, I originally bought them for my Peasant skirt. The size is perfect I wear a 9 and ocationally a 9 1/2 and the nine fits like a glove."
4,Really Cute Shoe,"This shoe is really cute, do buy a size bigger then you usually wear. I am 9 and the 10 fits perfect. I can't wait to wear it !"
5,LOVE THEM,I love these sandals. They fit true to size. I wear a 7 1/2 and I bought a 8 because I don't believe they come in 1/2 sizes and they fit perfect. The heel is not too high and not too short. They're just the right height. I like them because I can look cute while a shop and not have my feet hurting.
1,heavy shoe and the sizes run a whole size smaller,i was disappointed on the shoe too heavy and size runs very small plus there is no half sizes offered and amazon won't replace with another size so I lose out in 11.00 for postage and got NOTHING! better off going to the stores in person.
5,super funkie shoe,"This shoe is great. It is comfortable, the brown color is super nice, the heel is from real wood, very nice. It looks great w/dresses, skirts, jeans etc. It is super versatile, though it is a little bit heavy because it has a chunky piece of wood. The leather is very soft, and I think you have to size up a 1/2 size."
3,"Shoe is ok but, returned and NEVER GOT MY CREDIT FOR IT!!","Bought and returned size 8 shoe, reordered the size 9 and shoe is kewl! HOWEVER...AMAZON STILL HAS NOT GIVEN ME MY CREDIT FOR THE SIZE 8....THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.........MY ATTY AND I AWAIT AMAZON'S RESPONSE...."
3,Kinda powdery sand,"This sand is so fine that it almost seems more like fine powder rather than grain like sand. I bought it to go with some candles of mine and while the color is okay, I got brown, it just is a little too fine for my liking, doesnt appear to be real sand at all. I would not suggest this to be used with young children as a play item. You'd never be able to clean it up all the way."
1,Snore.,"Dick is contemplating throwing himself off a bridge, but is 'saved' by Jake. They take a long, rambling journey through Norway, and possibly some other places, but I don't know for sure because I just couldn't read it anymore. Dick is trying to escape the influence of his 'famous poet' father, but it seems like the book is an excuse for du Maurier to feature her poetic descriptions of the fjords. Dick himself seems to be suffering from bi-polar disorder, alternately in love with and disenchanted by any experience he engages in often swinging from moody to moodier almost instantly. It's enough to make the reader just as crazy."
4,Cobb,"Al Stump's 2 biographies on Cobb - ""My life in baseball: The true record"" and ""Cobb"", simultaneously compiled but published decades apart have been discussed elsewhere. His sensational article in True magazine ""Ty Cobbs wild ten-month fight to live"", published soon after Cobbs death was the basis of this excellent Ron Shelton film. I read it in ""The greatest Baseball stories ever told"" (edited by Jeff Silverman and published by The Lyons Press) and with the benefit of a readers imagination complimenting a susequent viewing of the film made for a truely thought provoking experience. As a baseball-starved fan living in Wales, this article laid useful foundations regarding the game in its day and Cobb as an athlete and a person. I would reccomend this to anyone who has not been brought up on baseball or who hasn't the advantage of parents/grandparents memories and experience."
2,Not what I expected,"Based on the autobiography by Al Stump, this movie is not what I expected. Up front, I think Ty Cobb is the greatest ballplayer who ever lived. This movie did not do justice to his playing days. Most of the movie focused on his later life, and more so on his interaction with Al Stump. Very little was shown specifically related to his younger days or playing ball. If you want to know about the player read the book, because the movie is not the way to go."
3,not my cup of tea but Tommy Lee Jones is excellent,If you are a baseball or sports fan excellent movie. I did not finish because it was late and I fell asleep.
1,An El Crapola baseball movie,"Basically a hatchet job on Cobb; this movie focuses ona few episodes from the year Cobb spent with writerStump composing his autobiography. It is very disturbing,dark, and does not bring the classic game of the earlycentury to life, just the latter-day mean-spirited aspectof Cobb. You would be far better off reading Stump's bio,""Cobb"",or Charles Alexander's Cobb bio. The acting is ok;it's hard to argue with the casting of Wuhl and Jones, but ...This movie left me feeling queasy and in an angry mood.There is so much more to Cobb than portrayed here. Sorrythis isn't the typical Amazon gushing 4-star review, butthis trashy film does nothing for baseball fans."
1,not what I was looking for,"This movie concentrates on Cobb as a bitter old drunk desperately trying to get his life story told from his point of view. I expected to see more scenes from when he was playing ball, but sadly there is really only one scene that showed his legendary hitting and baserunning....and that scene is very short and quite poor. If you are interested in what Cobb was like as an old angry man, go for it. If you are interested in Cobb as the greatest offensive ballplayer ever.....skip this one in a hurry. Other than that, I thought the movie - on its own merits as a movie - was pretty lousy. I regret buying it."
3,"Good, but not great","Peter Green's life and career are very interesting to follow. His personal story is as moving as his music. Although this cd is not as strong as the previous ""In the Skies"", it is still possesing some shining moments. If you are already a Green fan, get this for your collection. If you are curious about his solo career, then pick up ""In the Skies"" first."
3,You Must Be Dreaming,"I love Peter Green and continue to listen to his music almost weekly. This is not an impressive outing for Peter. For some of Peter's older accomplishments give ""Then Play On"" a shot or better still the Blue Horizon Sessions. You'll love either of them. For up to the date great listening try ""Time Traders""."
2,not my cup of tea,"I had seen this book before I knew enough about Karl Popper to realize how unpopular creative thinking is with people who think they already know everything they need to know. Calling the common assumptions about what kind of future is in store for a planet as chaotic as life on earth has been in my 62 years the common sense version of the truth just has too much pride for me to find David Stove's wit to be as funny as his admirers claim to believe. My sense of humor has been too crazy for me to tell people what I think is funny, but David Stove managed to think things were funny when other people of his own point of view would agree. How weird is that?"
4,Great Story,This was a great read. I didn't really care for the ghost and skipped almost all of his story line and some other parts were also not necessary but if you are looking for a great love story then you have it here. The hero and heroine are very sweet and likable characters and I enjoyed reading as they fell in love. The ending was strange and seemed only to be there to add another love scene. It seemed to be written in a style that reminded me of Georgette Heyer - minus the love scenes of course.
5,A real gem!,"I just got turned onto this CD by ""Herman Gauche."" Really interesting. Sorta alt country rock I guess (though not ""country rock"" if you will--these guys sure ain't the Eagles.) Seems to be influenced by The Old, Weird America: peculiar, dark (sometimes even disconcerting), funny... Hard to peg really. (Seems to be a first release on some local, indie label.)"
5,AWESOME Denver band,I just got my copy of the album the other day and listened to all the songs -- I love these guys! Nathan Perry is my hero. Anyone in disagreement with this review can gfy. My favorite songs from the album are Opus 1 and Granite Heart. Insightful social commentary with a sweet beat. I can't wait to hear them in concert!!!
2,Chicken Madness,"So disappointing! I wanted high rez chicken photography and I got this - this is a joke. Last years calender was so much better. The chickens were happier, they put more production dollars into the calendar. This year it looks like my kid took a picture at a farm and made a calendar. Next year I demand the quality of 2010 calendar when making 2012's!"
3,What the bock?,"I buy this calendar every year and hang it in my kitchen. I love chikkins! And these are some extraordinary ones. But it has cost around $12 every year, why has it suddenly gone up to $30 for 2010? $30 for a wall calendar!?!?!"
5,You cannot find a better calendar for 2010,"First, it is only fair that I admit that the yardbird and I go way back.That said, Conan O'Brien, the new Oprah, told me to buy this. Who am I to question someone that has pushed the almighty Oprah to the side?I can only imgine the number of products that Conan will be sent to evaluate, so he can tell the masses to buy these products. Fret not, Conan will not lead you astray. ALL HAIL THE NEW OPRAH!!!Because I'm an Amazon Prime customer, I'll have this glorious ass kicking chicken calendar in two days. Buy this now before they are all gone! Conan has given his seal of approval, these things will dissapear fast!"
2,Maybe a newly updated edition will be helpful,"I was quite disappointed with this book. The information provided in the book is somehow outdated. I was in South Africa in early December 1999. And I was having problems finding accomodations by using the telephone numbers provided in the book. Also the price listed for transportation, accomodation,...,etc are also not up to date. At the end, I had to buy another guide book for the information that I was looking for."
1,Lonely Planet South Africa,"Instead of being a travel guide as I expected and paid for, I find this book to be more of a political ""manifesto."" Could Jon Murray only be a pen name for Karl Marx? Seems those Africaneers are only getting what they deserve according to the author. After reading this disappointing book I've decided to vacation elsewhere. If I should return to Australia I will not bother with another Lonely Planet ""guide"" like I threw out after only two days the last time I was there."
4,Este cd esta a todo dar! tanto paquete por este precio.,"comprenlo, esta muy bueno, para encontrar todas estas bandas y artistas esta dificil. yo se los recomiendo. juan"
2,Good music for the supper !,"First, you'll notice that Goebel did not include the Ouverture number 5 on this CD. If you want to listen to it, you""ll have to buy the ""Concerti per l'orchesta di Dresda"" (Musica Antiqua Koln, R. Goebel, 1995, Archiv 447664-2). L'ouverture num√©ro 5 is the most curious, disorienting and frantic piece I ever heard from Veracini. After listenig to the latter, I decided to buy the other ouvertures of Veracini which are on this CD. Trully, I was disappointed. Why ? Because this mucic gives me headaches and make me irritable. The main problem is that the movements are repetitives. Sometimes, I thought it was a perfect replica of the previous movement. Goebel should have recorded some concertos of Veracini and incorporated them between the ouvertures. The result would have been, perhaps, less aggressive for the listener.Now the good points: the sound is rich, deep and the orchestra play with great autorithy."
3,Check your Picture Tube,"I purchased the KV-20FV12 20"" over the FS model for 2 reason: The addition of S-Video in and side speakers. Well, to my dismay, the first unit I had had a crooked picture! The image on the TV tilted to the right, and was extremely obvious when viewing letterbox DVDs. I had to return the unit for another which did not have this problem.When making a purchase such as this, make sure that your Wega Tube is aligned correctly, as it can be very annoying watching a crooked picture on a high-quality flat screen.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, but I still think that Toshiba has offerings that are just as good and cost $80 less. I am a Sony purist, so I went with this TV."
5,Still the best,I recently purchased a panasonic CT-20SX10 because i figuredthat with component video and more inputs it would be far better thanthe wega. i was wrong. ... and i quickly returned it and switched to wega. it is .... there are great features like tilt adjustment and the sound quality is far superior to that of the panasonic pureflat. the picture is clear all the way to the edges. the problem of there being only 1 s-video input can be easily solved by purchasing an s-video switch. the remote is also very well laid out and it works well with my sony dvd player. it is still the best 20 inch tv available.
2,Less than Alluring!,"When this title first popped up on Amazon, I was thrilled to bits. I had pretty much bought up 90% of all Amazon's *Traditional Decorating* titles, besides mistakenly buying trifles like DOMESTICITIES, which is just about as traditional as Quentin Tarantino's bathroom.But to get back to the subject, I found most of the interiors (except the Chinoiserie-influenced one) suffer from a certain lifelessness. (Doesn't anyone in Greenwich read books that aren't bound in gilded leather or displayed artfully on a inlaid wood surface next to a giant magnifying glass with ivory handles?) The old abandoned mansions of Cuba show more life, peeling mouldy walls nothwithstanding. (What a long word! And probably misspelled too!)So there goes another book in my shelf of Desperate decorating disappointments, right next to this thing I bought about the Spanish style homes of Santa Barbara, which have really nice tiles!"
3,Great coffee table book,"If you're looking for a beautifully photographed coffee table book, then this is the one for you. The book is a very high quality visual treat; the cover is eye-catching and the photographs are superb. The writing, however, is very amateurish. It has no style or artistic flair, and is very pedestrian when compared to books written by other designers. If you want to read a wonderful book, get ""Rooms"" by Mariette Himes Gomez. Both the photos and the copy are excellent."
3,Only O.K.,"Although there is indeed a style that could be called Classic Greenwich, this is not it. This book is filled with newly-put-together interiors by a local decorator, no doubt married into money, trying to emulate a style of Established Old Money. While the interiors are not horrible, they are not particularly great either. A hint of what is to come is given in the one paragraph Forward by famed decorator Bunny Williams and her peak-of-chic antiques dealer partner John Roselli; it says nothing. Rather than buy the book, just take a flip-through at the bookstore."
1,not worth the money,"All of the houses look alike. The photo's are staged, poorly. Same slippers used in several photo's. If you look at one house, you've seen them all."
2,"For freshness, look elsewhere","This contains some nice Greenwich area scenery, but that is its only positive point. The author does not always understand that patterns must be interspersed with solids to avoid busyness. So many of the rooms fall under the rubric ""well-to-do American family home c. 1957."" As others have noted, text is generality-laden. Home exterior photos are sometimes OK, sometimes not, and sometimes missing."
5,"Timeless style, well worth it!!","Brilliant overview of classic timeless style and decorating. The written excerpts are well worth reading, with excellent tips and information."
1,Poor photo-graphy---boring,The title creates visions' of grandure; however you could probably find a better book at HomeDepot.
2,It would be better with other Romeo.,"Gheorghiu is excelent despite her voice is not adequate for an ideal Juliette! But she is a very good singer. The problem is the Romeo. Alagna sings terribly bad, with his unbearable nasal voice in excess! Why do they insist to sing together? Just because they are married? When will we have the pleasure to hear Gheorghiu with a true tenor and not a 'Cabaret' singer?"
4,Met my needs,"The triple CD case was broken on arrival. I swapped it with a spare I had, so no great problem. The CD's are scratch free and work fine. The booklet and case, whilst a bit tired, are OK. It was delivered quickly by US mail.I am happy with the purchase."
2,Ripped after 1 month,"Do not buy these sheet sets!! I was very upset to find that both pillowcases are now ripped after only 1 month of use. I've bought much cheaper sheet sets and have never had a pillowcase rip before. I would not buy anything from this manufacturer again. It looks like they both probably had a small tear to start with and ripped right along the sew line. I want to see about getting a replacement from the manufacturer, but since it's from China, I don't think I will have much luck."
1,Not what you think.,These sheets are not quality egyptian cotton. The finish and feel of the sheets is less than most regular cotton sheets I have owned. You get what you pay for I guess.
5,HIP and Alive,This is a superb recording. The performances are vibrant and the quality of the recording is stunning. There is a warmth and fullness that is often missing in recordings of period instruments. The ensemble sounds HUGE. I particularly like the second movement of the Concerto in F (S. 234). Oboes are used instead of strings as the accompaniment to the flute solo.A must have for any lover of baroque music.
5,Cats Rock!,"This book has some of the most interesting qualities I have ever seen!!! You should read this parody because of the realism. Ilene Hochberg has such wit and talent to think of these ideas, that I have been inspired! I love her way of putting cats into the purrspective of life. P.S. Take a look at the very back page/cover to see what my friends and I call the ""Macarena Cat"". Remember- Cats Rule, Dogs Drool!"
4,"Art enough, Sex not enough","While I enjoyed this book, I really expected something filthier from John Waters. He should release one of these every year. I'd be happy to help him curate it. If you like sex in art, you should check out sexinart.com It has a lot more of what I expected from this book."
4,Pretty good phone,COBT CT-P920 WH Digital Telephone Answering Machine with Caller ID Speaker PhoneI ordered the phone for the price. It has good features and works well. The numbers on the buttons are hard to read so I don't recommend it for older or sight impaired people. You cannot turn the ringer off as it only has a high/low volume button.
5,You'll Never listen to Beethoven the same way again.,"The crispness and the performances of the whole set are breathtaking. These nine symphonies are performed as Herr Beethoven wrote them, not as some reorchestrator felt they should be played 20 years after his death. The notes are splendid and tell alot about how they researched and came up with what is close to how the original scoring worked. Now, whenever I hear other recordings of the symphonies (my personal favorite is No. 6 - the Pastorale) I want the tempos to push harder. I have had this recording for a couple of years and still listen to it regularly. It is worth the price."
5,outstanding,"I purchased the 7th and 8th symphony one year ago. The newest DGG/Archiv 4D recording technology is certainly one of the best in the world. The result is just outstanding in quality, brightness, with all details of every instruments. I do not kwnow whether the other records of this album are also recorded using this technology. If yes it is a must. Why not mentionning this technology after the record label (e.g. Archiv 4D)"
5,Brilliant,"I have never heard Beethoven played with such verve and excitement. While the Karajan and Furtwangler Beethoven symphonies are majestic and stately, like a top-of-the-line Mercedes Benz, Gardiner's purrs, roars and sings like a Porsche.The Third simply rocks. It's as if Gardiner re-interpreted the young Beethoven as the enfant terrible his contemporaries took him for. The fifth, particularly in the transition from the third to fourth movements, conrtains everything anyone needs to know about music.Gardiner finds awe in thr Pastoral, mischievous humour in the seventh. And the ninth, shorn of a century of German romantic bombast, sounds like the revolutionary anthem Beethoven likely intended.The problem with Beethoven symphonies, though, is that you have to listen to several interpretations to really appreciate the transcendent Genius of Beethoven.Get this one. Byut get Furtwangler's and Karajan's first set as well."
3,An interesting yet not always convincing alternative,"Gardiner's Beethoven shares the same qualities with other recent releases of the ""Titan's"" work: it tries to convey briskness and vigor instead of pathos and larmoyance, like older conductors and orchestras were wont to. The problem, however, is not Gardiner's conducting - which is among the finest in the world - but his orchestra: like other recently founded orchestras (Chamber Orchestra of Europe, London Classical Players) it is like a smoothly-running, yet completely impersonal 4-cylinder engine; or, in other words, Gardiner's orchestra plays like the perfect High School Swot, passing with honors, bot not really liked by most of his fellow students. There is very little warmth or emotional commitment in this performance; still, it provides fresh insights and a new approach to some of the most widely performed pieces of music."
3,"Boring story, poorly written but with a great message","When I saw that Hybels, Blanchard and Hodges had collaborated on a ""novel style"" book about leadership, I was thrilled. Three men worked together on the book but they needed a fourth, a novelist. The story was poorly written, boring and couldn't keep my interest. I expected so much more from Hybels and Blanchard. At the same time, if you get passed the poor writing and boring story line, the content is exceptional. My recommendation is for the reader to skip to the checkpoints beginning on page 171. They are valuable and worth the cost of the book. Servant leadership is greatly needed and seldom understood. This book will help define it, explain it and assist you in putting it into action."
2,Very Slow Story!,"I was absolutely bored to tears while reading this book. I think that a lot of the suggestions towards better leadership are very well intentioned and are good ideas, but it is very heavy in religion. If you are a strong believer in JC then this book might appeal to you. I was sick of the many religious references by page 30. The story was also poorly written. I found myself having to re-read portions of the book to understand the point. The only thing I will remember from this book is EGO (you'll get it once you've read it)."
1,Solid loooking product but no strength!,"After only one year of use the compressor knocks and makes noises, so guess what....I had to replace it BECAUSE IT ONLY HAD A 90 DAY WARRANTY!"
2,the CD is lacking,"this CD lacks one of the better known (in the mid 60's) hit called ""the Crusher"" these guys had the hit originaly, and did it the best. I would have liked to see that on this CD, in order to give the CD a much higher rating."
3,None Too Subtle,"This album suffers from overproduction. Roddy often sounds overwhelmed by the horns, female backing vocals, and big drum sound. ""Everybody Is A Number One"" and ""One And One"" are pretty much unlistenable. Other tracks fare better, despite the kitchen sink/sledgehammer production. ""Deep & Wide & Tall,"" ""How Men Are,"" and ""More Than A Law"" sound pretty swell. I just got this import CD to replace my domestic cassette version, and was disappointed to find that ""Deep & Wide & Tall"" here is in edited form. The full version is definitely better."
5,Looking for this for sometime,I really like this CD and have been looking for it for sometime. I am so glad to have found it. It is really enjoyable and tender romantic music.
2,Dissapointing from a true Aztec Camera fan,"Aztec Camera started out so brilliantly with Hard Land, Hard Rain, and the great but lesser album Knife. Then they came out with this album. Was this supposed to be the breakthrough album? It is certainly a departure. Overly produced, the sound to most of the songs have an adult AOR feel to them, losing the great pop touch of the prior albums. What happened? Studio execs? There are still some good songs on this album like Killermont Street and Somewhere in My Heart, but its really a weak effort, not worthy of Roddy Frame's great genius. Luckily, the first 2 albums are so good, its easy enough to dismiss this one and give Roddy the benefit of the doubt and the chance to redirect and get back on track."
3,Decent pop album- What do expect from a title such as LOVE,Learn to be a critic. Ignorant comment to claim to never again listen to another album made because one may be unsuccessful in your eyes. Don't ever listen to U2 because October was shallow lacking content in their lyrics utilyzing easy guitar licks and chords.
2,What hapened?,"Oh, my, how disappointing! Introduced to Aztec Camera with the wonderful High Land Hard Rain, and even more impressed with Knife and the live 5 song cassette, Love came to me in my freshman year at college when I was working my first disc spinning job. It came to me to review it as part of my job in the 'alternative' archives, and I was so excited to see a new album by Roddy and the boys that i had the review written before I'd even zipped the plastic off the vinal. What a blow I was in for! Shallow and listless lyrics, (following such songs as Backwards and Forwards and The Birth of the True) I vowed never to listen to anything new by them, and to live in the glorious past, rather than be disappointed in the future of Aztec Camera!"
1,I thought it sucked!,"This was so disappointing! I don't think I could ever listen to their music again. Knife was ok. and so was Love, but after them two, thier music just plain out sucked!! I was so embarressed after buying the c.d, I burned it and buried it so it can never be listened to again."
1,eddman,tis drum kit doesn't even have a full drum kit that price is a total rip off i would buy a five piece drum set($)come on werw kids not millionairs you know so next time think about the price
4,Excellent come back....,There should be more reviews for this album. It is actually well put together and can play all the way through. If you have two or more YB albums you definitely need this one.
2,Buyer beware...,"The song 'Don't Give It Up' is NOT the full-length version that was popular. Instead, just as it's getting good, it goes into a slow fade. When is Amazon going to publish times for all cuts on all music?"
5,"Puccini: Tosca (complete opera) with Maria Callas, Carlo Bergonzi, Tito Gobbi, Georges Pretre","Puccini: Tosca (complete opera) with Maria Callas, Carlo Bergonzi, Tito Gobbi, Georges Pretre is a 1965 recording starring Maria Callas in the role as Floria Tosca under direction of Georges Pretre. Callas performance is amazing as always. Truly a legendary opera singer. The booklet contains besides all the lyrics and well-written music notes also short biographies of the performers. Highly recommended. 5/5."
3,Vocally Proplematic,"Maria Callas always had trouble keeping her high notes under control. By the time of this recording, they were REALLY all over the map. Yes, she is dramatic but the singing is so wild! One of my biggest complaints of Callas is her vowels. The vowel E becomes Euh. Oddly enough, she turned that around in the 70's for her recital tours. I bought her last North American recital (with Di Stefano) from Amazon and was quite surprised. E, became E, thankfully. The wobble shows up a little less that it had in the past, too. There is a great one, though, on the high note in Suicidio! It's hysterical.I just can't stomach the voice at this time in her career. Other soprano's with long careers, such as Freni and Sutherland, also had wobbles late in life, but the voice was still beautiful. Go for Carmen if you want to hear late Callas. There are few high notes and she is wonderfully dramatic. Get the Freni Toscas if you want a really great recording.The rest of the cast is great!"
4,Good old time cd.,"CD that brings back memories from a very cool period of time. Todays music is great, but this orginal ground breaking cd sill ranks right up there,"
2,Anarchy Malarky,"The main appeal of Peel is obviously the controversy. I do not consider drug use, rebellion, vulgarity and STDs a good topic of entertainment. Good musicianship is also not one of Peel and Co. strong points. Factors contributing to the deterioration of society are nothing to celebrate or sing about, not in the way this band does.These same topics are sung about on later lps as well, which can only be described as musical anarchy, or an assault on what most consider sacred. I for one also love to look back on 60s and 70s rock with fondness, but the audience should be free from propaganda from ultra-left political sources under the guise of entertainment."
5,"awsome, drug induced cd",see above! This cd is a wonderrrrrrfull cd for any one who likes to party and chill..........
1,"Stupid then, stupider now","David Peel and the Lower East Side are a not-so-gentle reminder that there are some relics of the 1960s that should stay missing. The most notable thing Peel and company ever did was aid and abet John Lennon in practically capsizing his street cred in 1972; thank goodness Lennon didn't get sucked under by them (even with all of his subsequent travails).If you absolutely HAVE to have this as a memento of the decidedly odd social history of that time, it's your money, go waste it. Otherwise, there are a ton more musical artifacts from that period that are loads better. Caveat emptor."
5,Wingo review,"Absolutely Great!! could not find this car in any of the major toy stores, went onto Amazon found it in a snap, one happy grandson later adding to his toy pixar cars collections"
1,'Round the Campfire,I have never been so displeased with an item I bought from Amazon.com. The singer has absolutely no tonal quality to her voice and the rendition of the songs belongs in the garbage pail. I hope that no one will be enticed into buying this album. These are the worst renditions of these songs I have ever heard over the past 50 years I have been involved with campfire songs.Charles D. Ebert
5,Great for singing along!,"My three children (ages 7,5, and 3)and I love this CD!The songs are so much fun to sing along with. We always have it on in the car. Kathy has such a soothing quality to her voice, and the tunes are so ""catchy"" that you just can't help but sing! Several of the songs are old favorites like This Land is Your Land (my daughter Ingrid's favorite) and If I Had A Hammer. There are also some songs that are new to me. We just can't say enough about our favorite childrens' artist Kathy Byer. This CD is such a great next step after her previous release Do You Wish You Could Fly, which we also love. 'Round the Campfire seems to be geared to a slightly older audience, which is perfect for my 7 year old who considers herself too old for kids' tapes but enjoys Girl Scout sing-a-longs. Oh, and we all love The Littlest Worm!"
5,Better than any other ground resistance tester.,"Compared to other ground resistance testers with 3 or 4 ground probes, there is no contest. Forget the probes, just clamp the meter around a service ground and you get an instant reading. Even better, the clamp tester reads the resistance of all parallel paths at once, instead of the single path measured with probes."
4,Great! Now Let's Have More,"Wonderful! I am glad this is finally receiving the treatment it deserves. Now somebody needs to get on the stick and release the rest of this series. In addition, it would be great to see some of the other old Mystery/Horror/SF/Fantasy anthology series released such as ""Way Out"" and ""Panic!""."
2,One Step to Boredom,"Yes I used to watch it but was not fond of it. It had some good ideas and sometimes a plot of some interest but often was extremely boring with low production values. The problem was not so much the actors as the director and writers, I had the feeling they did not even enjoy the genre. Some will likely disagree but your money would be so much better spent on old and new versions of the Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, then Boris Karloff's Thriller, Friday the 13th - the series, Poltergist - the Legacy, Supernatural, Ray Bradbury Theatre, Tales from the Darkside and so forth."
1,Horrible!,"I consider myself a Sibelius Violin Concerto connoisseur, and this has to be one of the worst recordings out there of the piece. Chang's tacky bow and vibrato ""attacks"" on the opening line of the 3rd mvt., for example, are inexcusable for any artist. And where did she think she was going with the speed she opened the movement with? Obviously nowhere! This is a raucous recording that plunges Sarah Chang to another level below ""respectable violinist."" Her Mendelssohn is so-so, but the echo in this bad acoustic recording destroys the piece, giving it a falsified dreamy quality. This concerto is classical period at it's peak! I do not recommend this disc at all! For a better version, try Kavakos', Mutter's, Lin's, and even one of Heifetz's numerous recordings for a little spice. Believe me, you won't be disappointed like I was with this album."
5,"Great Guide To Denver, With A Few Omissions","CITY SMART: DENVER is a great guide to the city of Denver. It contains a listing of all the shopping, recreation, and dining you could want to experience while visting there. However, in the list of radio stations, many are not mentioned, including, especially, classic rock giant KRFX. However, you still should not pass this book up."
5,Great pants !,"I ordered them as a birthday gift for my husband, but i haven't expected him to be so pleased with them. The pants look and feel great on your skin, and are great for cold windy days. Thanks to this product, my husband is now a George Foreman products' fan."
3,"reasonable conclusions, but little useful application","I picked up this book to assist me in a project for an undergraduate English class at the university I attend. Because of my interest in the theories of Dr. Carl Jung, my professor suggested Frye as a critic I might consider studying. He really raised my interest when he told me that Frye was an archetypal critic, but, unfortunately, I didn't find the book to be too useful. Although Frye's arguments are reasonable and well-intended, I found his theories to be much too general to be useful for practical criticism. Perhaps my opinion would be different if Frye had provided an example of his theories in application."
2,Interesting but dated,"I don't know if I got the right video, but when I ordered this here I got Video Visits - Hong Kong & Macau. It is interesting, but short (24 minutes) and very very dated. My VHS tape is dated 1988 (not 1995). I was hoping for more recent information."
5,Great Vocab Builder,"I have 8th graders that are academically challenged. This dictionary provides good definitions, a sentence using the word, and sometimes even a picture. The kids love it and feel like they understand a definition when they look it up. With other dictionairies, the definitions are written on a level which seems to make the assumption that you already know a lot of vocabulary. This dictionary breaks down meanings without losing the the ability to appear erudite in the process. It more than suits the students' needs and mine."
3,good begginers dictionary!,"there was,however,a lack of interesting adjectives! however, it did help me when needed, but now i own and frequently use,a Merriam-Websters collegiate dictionary,deluxe edition. as a student, my macmillan dictionary for students, came of great use. i enjoy relaxing and reading/skimming through dictionaries , and well, this one kept me entertained for several days. i was,however, dissappointed by the lackof interesting adjectives,but this dictionary is still a good buy!"
3,Avril Lavigne Karaoke,"Okay , When I first bought this album , I thought it would be instrumental tracks with the vocals digitally removed . It turned out to be their own version of the song without any words . But the music is still almost the same . So if you're expecting raw instrumental tracks , you've come to the wrong place , but if you want something close to it , Then buy this album . I would recomend it if you're just looking for something close to the real thing ."
3,avril is hot,this cd is sooo cool its not what i expected but its good caz you can still sing along with the music and avril is so unreal i saw her live in sydney on june the 2nd and she was awesome it was the best concert i have ever been to...i recomend the cd it is unreal bye avril fans i love you all and i adore av and thanx for the reviews that let me buy the cd!
1,I HATE AVRIL!,"Well, this is kind of sad to say but Avril Lavigne has gone totaly idiot! Have you heard her new song don't tell me? I have and it's got some pretty bad langgugge plus it's got other words in it i don't want to tell you about. Please don't let younger children buy Avril Lavigne's cd or listen to her new songs. I was an Avril fan a few minutes ago until i heard don't tell me. When i heard her new song i was disscusted. I also started to cry because that's not the Avril i once knew and wanted to be when i grew up. I can't beleive Avril would write such mature songs when she know's there are millions of fans that are even younger that 6! I think Avril should shut her stupied mouth and stop being such an idiot case! I hope Avril falls off a bridge and dies!"
5,A very fine achievement,"This is one of the best recordings of vespers that I'm aware of, and it boasts the participation of the unforgettable tenor Charles Daniels, who is one of the best performers in his field. This disc collects vespers from a number of composers active in Italy throughout the 17th century; it is, therefore, a very good introduction to the genre, in addition to being a fine work of art in and of itself. Yet, I know of an even better recording of vespers which I would like to recommend to you: it is Cavalli's Vespro della Beata Vergine (dir. Bruce Dickey). While McCreesh has Charles Daniels, Dickey has my other favorite baroque tenor, Mark Padmore, whose hauntingly beautiful voice spans both tenor and alto registers."
5,important contribution,Pragmatics in Language Teaching is an important contribution in the field of Interlanguage Pragmatics
1,Assault Sucks,Dude this is quite possibly the worst one of the bunch. its just boring doughnuts in expensive cars and boring shots of lambos. theres some drifting but its boring there should be more destroying stuff which is what tek is known for
5,A-Freaking Mazing!!! I love this wash!,I was very reluctant to try this product but I am glad I did. It smells so wonderful and is absolutely refreshing. I really do feel clean after I wash. Others I have used leave either a film or dry me out but this feels like it has just been made for my skin. I do swap back and forth with the ageless acne and ageless moisturizer. I also recommend the eye moisturizer. It has done wonders for myself.
3,TERRIFIC EXCEPT THE DON,"This is a terrific Don, except that Gilfry, while good doesn't dominate the opera like a Don should. The Masseto has more personality than Gilfrey as the Don.Too bad. I'm spoiled having heard Siepi at the Old Met. Of all the Don's I've heard since then, Thomas Allen is the only one that had 'it' to be the Don. Never heard Petri live of course, the dvd Naples 1958 is worth searching for. Also has Bruscantinni, Ligabue, Sciutti, Alva."
2,Fabulous Donna Anna,"John Elliot Gardiner's way with most music (including Mozart) is to strip almost all color from the orchestra and (especially) from the singers in an amateurish attempt at being ""authentic."" Rodney Gilfrey has a lovely baritone voice, but he suffers from this approach. The one singer that escapes from this unscathed is the fabulous soprano Luba Orgonasova. I'm sure we would've heard even more glorious color from this magnificent voice had another conductor been chosen. That aside, check out Ms. Organosova's recital of arias on the naxos label. She rivals even the great Joan Sutherland in her mastery of the bel canto showpieces."
2,Old Standby - Good on History,"This was one of the first lighthouse books for this region, and because of that, it's kind of dull compared to some of the more recent ones. However, it's great for people who want historical information (for example, lighthouses that have been torn down) and for people who want a comprehensive list of area lighthouses, not just the most photogenic or easy to get to lighthouses!"
3,Turner: One of the Eighties Great Rock Voices,"In 1985 former Rainbow singer Joe Lynn Turner released Rescue You, his first solo record. Interestingly, the LP's credits contain the following note: ""This album is dedicated to the memory of Richard Mason Blakemore,"" an obvious jab at guitarist Richie Blackmore, who disbanded the successful Rainbow in order to reform Deep Purple. Turner joined Yngwie J. Malmsteen's Rising Force in 1988 and sang on the hit ""Heaven Tonight."" Turner again worked with Blackmore in Deep Purple when vocalist Ian Gillan left the group in 1990; but after one album together, Masters & Slaves, both left the band."
2,Drama,"If you like watching drama involving a bunch of stupid people then watch this, otherwise don't waste your time. Save yourself some money if you do plan to endure this show and watch it on Netflix like I did though."
5,The best of this series,"Aeoliah Healing Music for Reiki Vol.3 is simply the best of this series for me is a must...Very centering for the heart , YOU NEED IT!!!!I work with my friends every wednesday and i've tried all the series and for me this is the best , soft music for Reiki..."
2,Callas ducking the high E-flat and not convincing enough,Callas ducks the first high E-flat in the Mad Scene and generally sounds unconvincing throughout. She labors through the coloratura and sounds bored. von Karajan's awful conducting is way too slow and life-less. The sound is dry and boxy. di Stefano overemotes Edgardo's music.
1,Use something else!!,"I just took the MAT and now I feel like I wasted a lot of time with this book. It sets you up to think you need to cram a lot of high school-esque facts (history, geography, philosophy, music, bla bla) into your head. Which I did, for two weeks. Then I take the test and it seemed to me to be alot of word play type questions, like SLEEP:PEEL::LOOP: and the answer is SLOOP. The REA review didn't have any questions like that in their practice tests, and it's hard to sit there during the test thinking ""word jumbles??"" and try to get your brain in that track. There were maybe 10 questions that my studying was useful for. I think any other book (and I admit, it was stupid to rely solely on one book!) would have been more useful and on target than this one."
3,Worth getting if...,"With eight tests and next to no strategy, this book is ideal for a ""disaster check"" before you take the test--provided you use it as a supplement to other study guides."
4,It helped me a good bit,"Well, I bought this book to study for the test. It was the only book I bought. I scored in the 89th percentile, and I know I would not have done as well if I didn't have this book. Whether I would have done better had I used another book will always be a mystery."
3,Good period performance,"If you like Beethoven on period instruments and taken at breakneck speed, this is an excellent choice. But Gardiner in his attempt at ""authentic"" music misses some of the mystery and drama in the music in my opinion. I don't care how authentic his speeds are, to my ear they are too fast to appreciate the detail in the score. There is no doubt Gardiner is an esteemed scholar and many of his baroque performances are unequaled. I simply prefer my Karajan, Bernstein, and Previn in this symphony. If you must have a period performance of this one, look for Roger Norrington or Charles Mackerras conducting."
3,Not a Bad Story,"A good one from the old cold war days of spy thrillers. The author does a solid job with his writing and does keep the story moving. I have noticed that the more books he puts out the less is getting edited away, and my opinion is that is close to including too much that will slow the stories down. I would suggest The Blind Run from this author as one of his better works. There are the prerequisites multiple plots and trouble main character you find in most books of this type. All in all not a bad effort."
4,Good Fun!,Good help for those who are not familiar with Monkey Mitt songs and finger plays. Gives you several enjoyable activities to facilitate with your children.
2,A nice coffee table book.,"The book has thousands of pictures of watches, mostly pocket ones. However, it does not cover the history of such watches It's just a picture timetable of watch development."
2,'if it ain't broke...',"Shugart's 'Price Guide' has received some flack in Amazon's past reviews. However flawed, it's still the gold standard for valuing timepieces. I found Judy's book both disjointed in its organization, and naive in its assessment of watch pricing. Bottom line; if you're looking for a coffee table book with some pretty pictures, '100 Years of Vintage Watches' will fit the bill. If you buy, sell, or collect watches, stick with Shugart."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"Dean Judy has hit the bull's-eye with 100 Years of Vintage Watches, A Collector's Identification & Price Guide. Unlike Shugart's reference, Judy has written a book that will appeal to everyone who has an interest in, not only collecting watches, but appreciating the visual beauty of a bygone era. The illustrations are nothing short of phenomenal."
4,Cool Comp,"I heard this at my last job about a year ago when one of the A/V Techs played it. It's cool, standard Kravitz, it's got ""Mr. Cab Driver"".Cool driving/Sunday cd. Should be cheap here. Check it out."
4,"Fly Away, Rocker Soul Brother!","There doesn't seem to be an end to the musical dexterity of Mr. Lenny Kravitz. He blends heavy guitar rock with traditional black soul so well, that sometimes it becomes difficult to classify his work. He always manages to silence his critics with one above-par album after the other. This best of...collection is just what a lot of his fans have been waiting for. You simply cannot beat the guitar work in songs like, ""Are you gonna go my way"", ""American woman"", and ""Fly away"". ""It ain't over till its over"", ""Let love rule"", and ""Again"", are also some of the songs constantly under the ""Repeat"" command on my CD player. This rocker soul brother is definitely gonna be up there for a long time. A definite must buy."
4,Lenny 's Golden Thread,"Lenny Kravitz has always presented this problem: his music is firmly placed in the ""retro"" category, yet it is hard to relate to him as anything other than postmodern. In many ways his music evokes the spirit of the 90s (""Fly Away"", ""American Woman""), which suggests that the decade was one in which pop music finally was able to reconcile the need to reinvent itself with full acceptance of its rock 'n roll roots.Now we are looking at Lenny Kravitz' output in bluesy retrospection which is apt to make anyone wonder what it is they are being nostalgic about. This is especially true if you have already immersed yourself in his songs thrugh his ubiquitous similar-sounding CDs and innumerable clips on VH1, in which case purchasing this CD is probably redundant.A fine collection of his best work, but of itself devoid of a niche that could elevate it to a compilation that stands as a work of art on its own terms."
3,Doesn't include enough of the really good stuff,"For an album of Lenny's greatest hits, this sure leaves off some of his greatest in favor of more mediocre tracks. For example, where is ""Mama Said"" or ""Fields of Joy""? Other key tracks missing from Lenny's amazing early years are ""Rosemary"" and ""Freedom Train."" Where's ""Magdalene""? And does Lenny really believe his remake of American Woman was great? A much better selection would have been his duet with Mick Jagger on a remake of Bill Withers' ""Use Me"" from Jagger's '94 Wandering Spirit album. True Kravitz fans would be better served picking up the Let Love Rule and Mama Said albums."
4,Great intro to Lenny,"This CD is a great introduction to the world of Lenny Kravitz. For those only familiar with his songs on the radio, this CD offers you a chance to hear a mini-history of his music.If you are looking for something not too deep and a little funky, pick this one up."
5,Superb,"If you like Lenny's songs, this is a great collection. If you want only the best he has to offer from all previous CD's, this is great. There are only a couple songs that did not hit the charts, but they are great also."
5,Great Collection,"For those of you that like only selected Kravitz hits, this is a great CD. All of his best hits on 1 CD!"
1,"Don't buy, it will not download!",Bought this album 3 times here and even after downloading every version of Amazom downloader it still will not download. It just charges $5.00 to listen to the demo version each time. Oh well.
1,"Lenny Kravitz is the Hitler of ""Rock"" Music","Lenny Kravitz is perhaps the most mediocre, unoriginal and uninteresting musician of our generation. Emphasis on UNORIGINAL. He's a kitschy, commercialized, Diet Caffeine Free rip-off of Jimi Hendrix, minus everything good."
1,lenny who,"never really liked the guy's music...are you gonna go my way is decent. he's never done anything original or worth mentioning, just like most of the ""artists"" in music business."
1,Greatest Hits?,"Lenny must need some quick Christmas cash to have a greatest hits album out this time of year.He's only had 6 mediocre songs played on the radio,and the only one I ever enjoyed was ""Are you going to go my way."" He copies every Artist,from the Beatles to Hendricks on all his records.His two biggest hits,""Fly away,"" and ""Its ain't over till its over,"" are the same cords and words repeated over and over again.I have no idea how this artist gets airplay."
4,Good bang for your buck,"I'm not the hugest Lenny Kravitz fan, but you get 6-8 great classics for the price of one CD. Can't really go wrong with this one."
5,Crazy price,"I paid almost nothing for it. It has a good music selection, and I didn't have to wait too much to get it."
5,Diverse and exceptionally talented,"This is a great cd. His talents are showcased. He can jamm with he best of them, and then shift to incredible ballads."
2,LENNY DOESN'T HOLD UP WELL AFTER YEARS GONE BY,"Listening to Lennys latest album ""Greatest Hits"" I realize his music does not hold up over the years.His latest single ""Again"" is good, but it is just average pop that eventually wheres thin on the pop music brain. They have played it to death on radio, and it became one of his biggest hits...why? When you have ""Black Velveteen""?Other songs that did not make it on here from his album ""5"" are better than his renditions of the tired ""American Woman"", and his Top 20 hit ""Fly Away"" is good, but again tires too.Only one standout song on this compilation lives up to any classic rock abiltiy and that is ""It Ain't Over Till Its Over"" which has a Marvin Gaye/Al Green quality written all over it.Otherwise this CD is pretty much a bore."
1,Low on cash Lenny?,"Let Love Rule is one of the BEST albums of all time. Mama Said is another wonderful album. I do not consider this to be an accurate representation of Kravitz's finest work. It's a money grubbing act of poorly chosen top 40 radio hits. I have lost all respect for this artist. If you want to hear Lenny's grestest hits, buy his first album. It is truly a work of art."
4,RockPhunk Ganngstah.....,"....and Guitar God for the NeoPrimitives and the Wireless Generation. Fifteen tracks of the best of Lenny and Band. You hear me joke about Music for your Momma. I don't think most Mommas would mind, especially the track ""(My) Momma Said"". Don't forget to tell'er that Slash has a solo on it, so it may get loud. Shucks, Lenny has been influenced by many artists--Prince, the Beatles, Curtis Mayfield, and on and on. Too bad Sir George Martin's retired, it would be interesting to see what develops from such a colloboration. I'm proud of the dude, see, 'cause we--E and I--were into his rocking soul sound for a time, now. It's like we were into him before anyone else ""got it"". Many of you have artists you follow that you feel that way about, I'm sure. Methinks the wife, however, has a crush on Lenny Boy. Oh well. ""It Ain't Over Til It's Over""....and ""Let Love Rule""..."
1,Outrageous.,"I cant understand why sometimes people need to consume this kind of poor music.Lenny is ,1-A mediocre instrumentist,2-A mediocre composer,3-And a mediocre vocalist.He is that kind of guy that needs to be arrogant to hide his selfindulgence and mediocrity.Lenny , go to do another thing , music is not your way , maybe his mother said to him that he is a good musician ,and he belived .Take a listening on Fly away for example,he copied the lyrics of Elton John in Skyline Pigeon,this is ridiculous,and the music is structurally talking very poor,the before powerfull music , American Woman , from Guess Who was destroyed by Lenny . Lenny , please I implore, leave us alone ,please."
4,Pretty Good Compilation,"Let me start by saying this album is worth the money even without the CD. The picture album of Kravitz inside the front cover of the case is priceless. It is yet another example of an artist who takes himself way to seriously, and is good unintentional comic relief for the rest of the album. As for the actual music on the CD, when it is what Kravitz does best, centered around guitar, it is excellent, ""Are You Gonna Go My Way"" and ""Fly Away"" make up about three fourths of the album, and prove very entertaining. The rest of the album is a little soulful for me. Fans of R&B might enjoy them, but for me they were a little to far off of his great guitar-work to make the album. Nonetheless, the excellent guitar ballads make this album well worth the price, and put it high on my recommendation list."
4,Good CD for casual Kravitz' listeners,The album sounds very good except some of the songs that I personally didn't like. But overall I'd vote for getting this album for those people that'd like to get familiar with Lenny's music.
3,"There's hits, but what's the greatest?","Well, he put his hits in there, but there are too many songs that have the same beat that arn't all that good. I'm also a little dissapointed that he put some not-so-good hits on there, but didn't put ""If you can't say no"" on there. That was a great song w/ a great, & unique beat, unlike some of the 70's sounding disco songs he put on there."
3,Maybe it is over........,"There has to be some hidden tracks on this CD- otherwise the title should be changed from ""greatest hits "" to just ""okay"". I really thought Lenny had evolved from a few great songs spread among several CDs- to one well done CD like ""5"". This compilation was a great opportunity for Lenny to redeem himself with his fans who have been holding on to great memories with ""Mama Said"" and ""Are You Going to Go My Way""- instead the quality songs are scattered from beginning to end- forcing me to stay close to the remote so I can skip over ""American Woman"" and ""Always on the Run"" and get to my current favorite "" I Belong to You"". I was very disappointed to find ""Thinking of You"" and ""What Goes Around Comes Around"" missing from this collection; next time check with the fans first before making arbitrary selections...."
4,lenny is awesome.,"This was a great album, I enjoyed it when it first cam out and loved that I can listen to it again"
4,Lenny Kravits greatest hits,This cd is the best ever I'm hooked on this cd he has the best hits ever!! And yes I would highly recommend this cd look at him he is sooo good looking not to mention great songs ever yes buy his cd u won't regret it!!! KC
2,"Thanks anyway, but don't we already own all these tunes.","One review above reads 'L.K. does it again!' whatever. Lenny hasn't done anything again - he just wants you to buy what he's already done twice. What's with the over use of the 'greatest hits' album. Assuming he's going to make some more albums in his career, he should wait a couple decades and then package up a REAL greatest hits album. jumpin the gun a little aren'tcha Lenny? At least title it something like 'the hits so far for anyone who doesn't own my albums and needs to catch up' what? too wordy?! P.S. where's 'Rosemary' on this one?"
3,Not the greatest,"I am a Lenny fan, but this cd I didn't feel was his greatest. There are even songs on it that I skip right through, such as Mr. Cabdriver. Then again, there are many beautiful songs on it that I can put on repeat. Over all, I wouldn't recommend this. It is just ok."
3,"Alcohol based aftershave, NOT balm","I am of the personal opinion that nobody should be using an alcohol based aftershave, as this will severely dry out your skin. I purchased this thinking I was buying the balm, as the product description was rather vague - Amazon has since revised it. If your skin can tolerate the alcohol, and you don't mind the stinging associated with it, the fragrance is as wonderful as the Issey Miyake EDT, but toned down a smidgen."

1,Might be good for outside...from afar,Not worth buying. Not worth storing even if it was free. Returned to Amazon with no hassles though. Shipping was fast as always.
3,Not worth even the sale price.,This toy is not very functional.It's very wide and akward.My daughter couldn't really use this.On the plus side she did enjoy the electronic toy that you can take off of the car.
1,Very disappointed!,"I bought this toy today but I am not keeping it. The activity panel is OK and works fine when it is detached from the steering wheel. However, when the cruiser is in the ride-on position, the activity panel is not fixed on the steering wheel. Instead it swirls every which way, making it very difficult for a child to sit on the cruiser and keep his balance. At some point my son's hand slipped from the side of the activity panel and he would have fallen down had I not stood right next to him. He got scared and started crying for me to take him off the cruiser.I bought this toy after talking to a store employee, but I whished I had checked the reviews on the web site before I made the purchase. I have found another walker that has great reviews and will make the exchange tomorrow."
4,Great toy for the Price,"I got this toy for my daughter when she was 9 months old and she loves it! Even at 18 months she uses it because is allows her to run so fast. It is solid and durable and can take her ramming it into anything and being on cement or left outside. Also, if your child is tall, the high handle makes it easier to use as a walker. This walker is nice and high and she doesn't have to bend over it order to rest her hands on handle. We have never kept the activity table attached, but keep it as a separate toy for the car etc. It is easy to use because the buttons push so easily. As a ride on toy, our problem has been that she refuses to see it as a ride on toy! Every time my husband changes it, she pulls up the handle and tries to use it as a walker. There is some truth to the comments made that it will tip foward on high carpet. We have mostly tile and hardwood, so this wasn't as much of a problem for us and in summer, she uses it outside."
2,Hidden dangers,"My son received this ride on for his first birthday. It looked very appealing and fun, but during our first day playing with it he tried to get on himself and stepped into the handle and got stuck. After plenty of baby oil I finally got him out, but he is now left with some really dark bruises on his leg. It was very heartbreaking to see him screaming because it hurt to move his leg. V Tech needs to look into something a bit safer for the pull up handle."
2,I agree- not pleased either,"I was not pleased with this toy either. My daughter received this for her 1st birthday. It looked so neat. She tries to play with it but it's so awkward she just gives up. It's OK ( not great) as a walker, but as a ride on, it just doesn't make sense. She has a hard time straddling it, and her knees get caught underneath the keyboard. It converts easily from walker to ride-on and it seems safe and durable, but if I had to do it again, I would buy a walker and ride on separately."
4,Loving my XMB-10,"The XMB-10 is a great way to listen to my XM Audiovox receiver at home. The boombox is slightly larger than I desired, but the sound is great, it's easy to use, lightweight, very portable and nice looking."
2,Antenna grief,"I love XM satellite radio. So I thought I'd try it in the house. The Audiovox XMB10 Boom box antenna simply doesn't work, no matter where it's pointed. Upstairs, downstairs, north, east, south or west side. Windows high or windows low. No reception. A waste of money."
4,Original and thoguth provoking,"As someone closely associated with the military, though not of it, I found Samet's observations of the military life, thought processes and customs fascinating. It is often difficult for those outside the life to distinguish between our society's idea of a soldier and individual soldiers themselves. We tend to believe that they are all cut of the same cloth -- proud, honorable, bloodthirsty, fighting men -- and tend to forget that the officer core includes poets, dreamers, and women as well.Many of these ideas about what a soldier should be filter down to us through our literature and our movies. Samel makes a good case that it is possible to use those images to our advantage, by encouraging thought and discussion about where those stereotypes come from, how they differ from actual experience, and what they say about the moral choices officers must make.Dulce et decorum est indeed."
3,A kid at war.,"As already stated, this is a fictionalized story of a young 15 year Minnesota boy who fought in the Civil War. Paulsen takes liberties in relating the short life of Charley Goddard. Goddard participated in many major battles of the Civil War such as Bull Run and Gettysburg. He shows the cost of war on the youths that fight it by relating the term soldier's heart. A soldier's heart becomes hardened by the experience of death in battle. He no longer fears death, viewing it as a way to meet the soldiers who proceeded him in death.This is a story detailing the cruelity of battle. Battle hardens our soldiers and puts severe strains on their mentail peace. This should be remembered in terms of the cost are soldiers are now going through."
3,Soldier's Heart,"I've here recently read the book, ""Soldier's Heart"" by Gary Paulson. This is a fairly decent book and would be greatly enjoyed if you're into the Civil War. The only real problem I see with this book is the ending. The story builds up this great plot but just drops you for the ending, causing much confusion. On a scale from 1 to 10, 1 being the worst and 10 the best, I give it a 6."
3,Soldiers Heart,"I think that the book is kind of all right at some parts. The best parts of it are the battles. The first battle is called Bull Run. Charley does'nt die in the the first battle, but it is a cool battle to read about. They shoot a big cannon, and it shoots off a guy's head. After that it goes through a horse from head to rear. After that battle they go back to fight the rebels again. This time the rebels have all ready left camp. But when they catch up with them again, they don't have much of a shoot out. Charley and the other ones on the front line shoot the rebels front line out, and they all go down. Charley and the others run as fast as they can straight at them and slaughter them all. I think that I would rate this book a 3 1/2. The title of the book is Soldiers Heart and the author is Gary Paulsen."
3,My Review Of Soldier's Heart,"Soldier's Heart by Gary Paulsen is about a boy named Charley who thinks he has to serve in the Civil War to be a man. The only problem is he is not old enough. He sneaks in and serves to his mother's dismay. It is a good book because I like learning about the civil war and the conditions they fought in. Its ending is a little hard to understand, but if you read carefully you can comprehend it."
3,My Book Review,"Soldier's Heart is about a fifteen year old boy, Charley Goddard. Everyone in his town talks about how fun the Civil War is going to be. Out of curiosity he lies about his age and joins the war. After the first battle he finds out how ""fun"" it is.This is a really good book. If you don't like history, then you may like the fact that it is filled with action and realistic features. Gary Paulsen puts you in the story. On a scale of one to ten I give it a ten."
3,...Soldier's Heart Book Review...,"...In my opinion, Soldier's Heart is an excellent book. Charlie, a young 15 year old, enlists in the Civil War in 1861, thinking it was going to be exciting. Although, he finds out he isn't old enough, so he lies about his age. Fighting in the war teaches Charlie a lesson he will Never forget. He saw many of the fellow soldiers die or recieve wounds. This book was very interesting during all of the battles. I enjoyed it very much, and recommend it highly...."
3,Soldier's Heart,"I give Soldier's Heart a 3 out of 5. It is about a 16 year old boy who lies about his age to fight in the Civil War.He wants to be in a big battle, but when he gets there he does not want a part of it.Overall it was a good book, but the end needs to have more detail."
4,A Soldier's Heart By: Gary Paulsen,"The book A Soldier's Heart by Gary Paulsen was a very intresting book. It always made you want to read ahead and find out what was about to happen. It is about a boy named Charlie who is 15 and decides he is going to lie about his age and go to fight in the war. He makes this decision because his mother is trying to support the family by herself since the father has passed away, and working on there farm isn't making enough money to support the family. So he gets in the action and sends home money to his mother for the farm and family. While he's at battle many good and bad things occured. So in order to find out what happens at the end you should probably read this spine tingly book."
1,Soldier's Heart Book Review,"Soldiers Heart is about a boy, Charley Goddard, who enlists in a regiment near his town. He goes and fights in the civil war. He is sore afraid at his first battle but finally gains courage. Will he survive?I did not like this book one bit. It does not hook the reader at all. It was a very, very boring book.I give this book a rating of o out of 0-10."
2,Soldiers Heart,I recently read Soldiers Heart by Gary Paulsen. I didn't enjoy the book at all. I am not really interested in the Civil War. The book is about a boy named Charly who is experiencing life as a Civil War soldier. The book explains how he reacts to battle and death.It also tells how he is able to survive. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the Civil War!
2,Soldier's broken heart,"This fiction work by a well known author was a disappointment to me. While the events no doubt happened, I thought that they could have been portrayed in more exciting, easier reading manner."
2,the horrors of this book,Soldier's Heart is a book about a kid who joins the war when he is 15. He finds out that war is horrible just like this book. This book was one of the the worst war books I have read. No one should even think about reading this book.
1,Gary Paulsen's Soldier's Heart,Soldier's Heart is about a boy named Chariley from Minnesota. He joins the cavarlary and goes down south to fight in the war. Gary Paulsen greatly describes all of teh features of war Chariley fights. I think the book has a wierd endig but has a great format. I give the book a 5 out of ten.
3,Soldiers heart,"""SOLDIERS HEART""""Soldiers heart"" is a great book because it is about a 15-year-old boy Charley and he wants to go to war because he wants to be a man. But he is15 years old and to be in war you have 16 years old and up. How does he really go to war?""""I think Gary Paulsen the author wants the readers to get the idea about war and how dirty and gross war is because he explains the details all through the book.""""I like the book because I like these kinds of books. And he made all the characters seem real in the book. Plus it is a good way of getting the taste of war. Go to your local library or to your school library.""By;Todd"
5,SOLDIERS HEART is great,Solders Heart is about a boy named charley who wants to go to war and he thinks he will become a man. when he is only 15 .when he goes to war he was trained and went to war .This book proved that war is not good or fun .War is not approprit . I liked this book because of all of the action.pleas buy this book.youll love it.BY Brandon
4,Read this book,"I think Soldiers Heart is one of the best Civil War books that I have ever read. It's about a 15 year old boy named Charley who joins the Minnesota Volunteers. Charley is in four major battles in the war. He loves how the girls give him sweets, but he's not ready for what happens in the battle. This book is great for a class that is learning about the Civil War. Gary Paulsen, the author, gives about every detail. I hope you read this book because it is very exciting."
3,Natasha's Review,"Soldiers Heart, By Gary PaulsenSoldiers heart is about a boy named Charley Godard who lies to get into the Civil War to fight. Charley, although, had no idea what he was getting himself into. I recently read the book and I think it was about too much fighting. If you like the Civil War then this is a good book for you to read because it tells where the soldiers moved to and how the soldiers lived during the war. Charley Godard is a very brave, eager to fight, and willing person."
4,Soldier's Heart,"Soldier's Heart is about a 15 year old kid, who joins the Union Army and fights in the Civil War. He gets in many battles and sees a lot of things no one should see.I think this is a very good book, but it is sort of gory. Younger kids wouldn't like it too much. I liked the book becase I like war history. Out of a scale of 1-10, I give it an 8."
5,A powerful book.,"Gary Paulsen's new book Soldier's Heart is a powerful, sad, and affecting potrayal of just how devestating the effects of the Civil War were. Charley Goddard was a young Minnesota farm boy eager to enlist and experiance the ""glory"" of war. But at his first battle he discovers the terrible truth about what war really is like. Wounded at Gettsyburg, he is sent home. While his wounds do begin to heal, their are inside wounds that will never go away, for Charley has been left with a ""soldier's heart"" - the term used after the Civil War to describe what today is called post-traumatic stress disorder."
4,A Soldier's Heart,"A Soldier's Heart book is definitely man vs. man, and sometimes-even man vs. himself. It affected my reality toward life. This novel taught me to never love violence and war. I thought this is a suspenseful story because Charlie (main character) really liked the fact that he was treated like a King with girls waving hankies. That was all about to change.I thought the author's purpose for writing this novel was to teach a moral lesson about people with a `soldier's heart.' Some history about the battlefields were involved in the plot, but still with great background description.Though I loved the book, I wasn't attached to any of the characters. The characters all used confusing words that w `slang.' To emphasize, the vocabulary is just too juvenile, and therefore this book was published for an audience less than twelve."
4,A boy at war,"""Soldier's Heart: Being the Story of the Enlistment and Due Service of the Boy Charley Goddard in the First Minnesota Volunteers"" is a novel by Gary Paulsen. The story follows a 15-year-old Minnesota boy who lies about his age in order to enlist in the Union army during the United States Civil War.This is a well-written narrative that gets into graphic details of wartime death and violence. Paulsen integrates interesting technical details about Civil War weapons, tactics, uniforms, and medical care into the story. Also of note is Paulsen's account of encounters between troops and civilians. The novel is told in a simple, matter-of-fact style that, combined with the book's often grim subject matter, can be truly devastating."
5,Soldiers Heart,I think Soldiers Heart is a good book because it is about the Civil War with a boy named Charley that is fifteen and goes to the Civil War. He tells the man at the sign-up that he is eighteen.I like the part when the rebels shot the cannon and hit a soldiers head off and then hit a officers horse.If you want to know if Charley gets shot or not you have to read the book. Thats why I gave this book 5 stars.
4,Astrid's book review,"""He heard it all Charley Goddard did; he heard the drums and songs and slogans and knew why everybody was crowding. There was going to be a shooting war."" The book Soldiers Heart is an exciting novel by Gary Paulsen.Charley is a 16-year-old that does not want to miss the great adventure at war. He acts 18 and joins Fort Snelling. Charley thinks the war will be fun and exciting. In the first battle when Charley almost gets shot, he realizes the war is dangerous, but he can not turn back now. Charley goes on many adventures and loses many friends. Charley learns that war is not an adventure but a horrible thing to be part of. Young children can learn about the civil war by reading this book. This book is not really for girls. Girls may not like all the violence."
4,soldiers Herat,"The Soldiers Heart was a very interesting novel.I liked this book because it gave many facts about the Civil War and how it felt to fight in the battles. This book is a very good novel to read if you like touching stories. One of my dislikes about this novel is that it didnt give very much detail. I would have loved to hear more about the relationships between the soldiers in the camp and between the generals.The best part in the book was when Charley, the main charactor, road the train for the first time and met his first colored woman. When he first met her she thanked him for fighting for her freedom and gave him a gift.This book took place in Minnissota and all around the United States. The charactores are Charley, the main charactor, Swenson, Charley's friend,the Generals, the colored woman, and Charley's mother."
4,soldiers heart,Soldier's Heart was about a 14 year old boy who lied about his age and enlisted in the civil war. It was very exiting and had a lot of action. It talked about how he didn't want to make any friends because he was afraid that he would lose them in battle. The book had a lot of blood and gore which was very cool. They even built a wall out of dead bodies to keep the wind out of the hospital tent. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes war stories. Charlie Goddard (the main character) was actually a real man and I think everyone should know his story.
3,A pretty good one!,"Charley Goddard wants to go to the Civil War in this historical fiction novel, Soldier's Heart, by Gary Paulsen. Charley is a Union soldier fighting the Rebels. Gary Paulsen shows the ugliness of war through one boy's eyes. I liked the book and recommend it to kids around 15 years old. It shows how a kid my age could grow up in the war and seeing people die and realizing what war is really about. It's not one of Gary Paulsen's best books, but it is a pretty good one."
5,A CONCISE MASTERPIECE,"I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH TO ATTEND A CONCERT PERFORMANCE OF THIS OPERA AND ""THE DWARF"" IN NY A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, MY INTRODUCTION TO ZEMLINSKY'S OPERATIC GENIUS. THIS RECORDING MORE THAN DOES HIM JUSTICE. JAMES CONLON HAS RECORDED BOTH OPERAS; A PITY THAT EMI HAS NOT CHOSEN TO PACKAGE THEM TOGETHER. DONNI RAY ALBERT SHINES IN THE CENTRAL ROLE OF SIMONE. VOIGHT AND KUEBLER SOAR AS THE LOVERS. A WARNING: THERE ARE NO LINER NOTES OR LIBRETTO."
5,Sweet songs,I love to hear these two sing oldies...it is interesting to hear them sing gospel..so refreshing.
4,Still a great movie,Enjoyed watching it again...I know it is an old move but I had to laugh at some of the make up done in it...but I am glad I own it now
5,I love Roots,I love watching Roots and will watch it over and over again. I bought it for my grandkids and for their children.
4,Come closer to Maria Callas,"This CD is a master piece of Maria Callas' performance. Together with Stefano, they created a milestone that their followers are difficult to overpass. Listen to this live, you feel you were back in 1955. The atmosphere it produced is fresh and new to the later generations. But because the record technique as mono, not stereo, if you feel untolerable for the mono, it will cut your expectation little bit. But generally, if you are really a fans of Maria Callas, you will definately like it."
1,Unbearable,"I know I differ from a lot of opera buffs, but sound quality is important to me. With so many good digital recordings out there, why would anyone buy this one? I agree with the statement that it sounds as if it was recorded with a hand-held microphone. As for Callas' singing in the last act, I cannot comment on it because after listening to about two and a half acts I pressed the eject button. I simply could not stand the tinny sound any more.There are a lot of great singers around today. Let's stop fawning over the ones who had the misfortune of singing before good audio recording equipment was avaiable. I'm sick of the cultural snobbism that tends to put down today's singers and exalt those of the past."
2,"Callas, Incredible voice, very poor recording","I was excited to hear this version of La Traviata, just to hear Callas's voice. ( I am new to opera ). She has one incredible voice, but I've heard better sound on 3 stooges re-runs.The sound is muffled, there is constant talking, coughing and hacking of people in the background. The singers sound as though they forget they are singing into microphones at times, bad dropouts.I was/am spoiled with the Sutherland, Pavarotti (London recording). I still maintain this recording is much better. Not only is the audio far superior (yes, I know it was recorded about 20 years later), there seems to be some wonderful chemistry between Sutherland and Pavarotti that shines through.All and all, I am glad I heard the recording, I just wish I borrowed it from the library and saved the $$$$$. Buy the Suth/Pav recording."
2,"Verdi - La Traviata/ Callas, di Stefano, Bastianini; Giulini","It is a live recording but I am sorry to say, a rather poor one! There is a graininess and shrillness to the recoding that is very disoncerting. I would love to be able to return it."
2,Not a good first version for your library,"Due to its' age this recording's quality is spotty. Sometimes the chorus may as well have been in another state. Callas' performance is wonderful, the rest of the principals are adequate. If you are filling out a collection of Callas' work this would be a worthy addition. If you really want to hear the opera, pick another version."
5,Fantastic Traviata!!!!,"How can anyone not love this passionate performance? The sound is good, the three principals are in top form. I don't understand all the bickering. I'm happy I got this lovely recording. Visconti, de Nobili, Giulini and Callas made operatic history in this performance, the critics, fans and everyone adored them. This recording is a milestone!"
1,Dreadful sound!,"There are some sublime musical moments on this recording, but the sound quality is so terrible it is like listening to an opera while having one's head submerged in a bucket! Save your money."
3,Tieing up the loose ends,"The man who performed under the name Rusty Evans did the songs on this disc and an interview with Michael Greisman. That Evans was the force behind The Deep and Hydro Pyro is evident in these songs which are a diverse batch of faux-Dylan, not-so-bad-blues and bland psychedelia. The 20 plus minute interview is intriguing as a story of someone who was what I would call a ""near-miss to success"" in the music business. Evans discusses his music career in Greenwich Village, LA and San Francisco; his contacts with various more successful musicians and provides some insight into his songs; it includes the comment that the material on the first album was written by him but performed with little or no arrangement or practice. Wow! What a surprise."
5,Very Intriguing & Fun,"Very Intriguing look into our own personal nature, wished more films would put this concept into their films. If you like/love Psychology, then I think you would enjoy it more, but perspective is to each their own lol. I Njoyd Immensely"
1,The nail polish is already dry,"I suppose this to be refreshing color for summer. Yet when I put it on my nails, I realize it's already to dry to spread. I've never experienced such problems with OPI brand-new nail polish. Thus I suspect nail polish sold by this seller is not of good quality and have been opened probably.And they do not allow return for the product, which is really annoying."
2,Eroica2: 2fast2furious,"For the life of me I cannot understand why Gardiner is the darling of critics making recordings like this. People are comparing Hogwood to Gardiner frequently here and to my senses, there is no comparison, because Gardiner's Eroica is simply tasteless and way out of bounds. The tempo of the first movement is so fast it barely makes sense at all. Many times parts which should be in the background are firmly in the foreground and it sounds bizarre, but I'm not sure that's the mixing or the orchestra (not that it really matters). Hogwood's is every bit as energetic and intense but Hogwood's sense of phrasing, timing, choice of tempo, orchestral balance, hell everything - is impeccable. Hogwood's Eroica from '83 or so is one of the greatest in recording history (if not the greatest) - this is just an experiment."
5,great lucia,"In my opinion,this recording is absolutely the best Lucia!In 1953 Callas' voice was perfect:a great dramatic soprano with immense agility.Her fiorituri are wonderful,her timing is incredible.Callas great cadenza in the mad scene is not only sung perfectly,but she also manages to put dramatic sense in there.Callas always tried to sing a recitativo or a an arioso with the same intensity as the great arias.I think that makes her Lucia more interesting than Sutherlands.Every opera-lover should buy this recording and one of Sutherlands' brilliant Lucias"
2,Callas not meant to sing Lucia,Callas cannot sing Lucia adequately. She doesn't have the coloratura for the role nor the convincing drama. She is quite awful in this opera.
5,The divine Callas as Lucia,"She took my breath away here. Those high notes, my GOD how beautiful! How could she sing like this, so beautifully? This will always be my favourite Lucia!"
1,Form over Substance,"I listen to World music all the time and especially latin beat, flamenco, etc...When I compare what I feel when I listen to my world music CD's of some ofthe world best performers with this DVD, my experience is that Nights of Fire isstale, bland, boring and aseptic.If you liked Nights of Fire, I highly recommend you check out the Putumayolabel and their 60+ world music CDs and discover the ""real thing"".If Nights of Fire moved you then go to the ""source"" and listen to the originalperformers of such musical styles. Nights of Fire is like frozen concentratecompared to freshly squeezed fruit juice."
5,Awesome Benise,If you have not seen and heard Benise you are in for a treat. This is a fabulous DVD. The montage is superb and will delight you.
5,Product Review,Ordered this CD for my mom for her birthday and she loves it. We received the CD ahead of schedule which was great because I was not expecting it until a couple days after the birthday :) This CD was in great condition :) Thank you!
5,PLEASE LET ME EXPRESS MYSELF FULLY & CLEARLY...,"THIS CD HAS SAVED ME MORE THAN ONCE. I CAN BE IN SUCH A PANIC ROUSTING ABOUT AND WORRIED AND ANXIOUS ABOUT THIS AND THAT BUT WHEN I PUT THIS IN MY CAR PLAYER EVERYTHING CHANGES. BENISE'S MUSIC GOES TO SOME DEEP PART OF ME, THE SPANISH GUITAR TAKES ME TO A DEPTH IN MY SOUL. I AM FILLED WITH FIRE...!THANKS BENISE. YOUR MUSIC FILLS ME WITH LIFE!--MARGARET OPINE"
3,The original lineup....to be kept and cherished forever......,"The recording and camera work is so poor at times that I am embarrassed to give three stars. But, I am compelled to do so because what we have here, ladies and gents, is one of the few filmed live concerts of the original band doing many of their trademark stunts that made them famous circa 1976. Complete with the famed laser show (albeit grainy), this could have been so much better had it been cleaned up a bit. Check out ""Stairway to the Stars"", ""Born to be Wild"" and the ""5 guitars"". A classic in its own right, to be enjoyed thoroughly by the dearest of fans and recommended to them only, like some forbidden heavy metal fruit"
1,"Poor recording, fades in & out.","Sorry, but it's hard to review the music when the recording is so horrible. Sounds like a Deadhead recorded it. Stay away from this one, get 'On your Feet' and 'E.T. Live' if you want the best live BOC."
4,A very lively Figaro.,"Bryn Terfel and Alison Hagley absolutely shine in this production of the Mozart classic. An even better treat is the dvd of the same production where we get to see the beautiful Alison Hagley hold her own playing Susanna to Bryn's Figaro. Considering this is a recording from a live performance, a little stage noise is to be expected and doesn't take anything away from the experience.I did have a problem with the overly campy rendition of Voi Che Sapete (What were you thinking, Sir John???) but that is a minor complaint."
4,Wu-Tang Clan Unreleased,Excellent album. I thought it is really good and almost the whole thing is good.
3,UNRELEASED,"THIS ALBUM IS A DIEHARD WU-FAN COLLECTOR. IT HAS THE WUTANGS OLD SOUND AND STYLE AFTER THE 36 CHAMBERS AND BEFORE THE WUTANG FOREVER SOUND. IN THOSE TIMES EVERYTHING SOUNDED DARK AND HEAVY ON THE MENTAL. IT IS BY ALLAH MATHEMATICS. THE WU-SOUND TODAY METAMORPHED TO A NEW TYPE OF FEEL INCLUDING MATH. HENCE, THIS ALBUM IS NOT FOR A SOFT EARED PERSON.DIE HARD FANS, REMENISCE ON THIS BACK IN THE DAY JOINT AND HOLD TIGHT ON THE GOD'S JEWEL."
5,Quality Funk Fusion,"Tight beats, funky grooves, and nice melodies. This record serves up some real hard-hitting funk."
3,great kids show,this is got to be one of the best learning kids show made.i like to get this set but ill wait till a Complete Series set comes out.at least i hope it will.if not oh well im out of luck then.
2,mislead,"i am a big fan of MSB and was extremely disappointed when i bought ""the three pack"" along with ""the collection"", as suggested by amazon. they are the same. more product information would have been great but to be given bad advice was deceiving and discouraging."
1,where's the content?,"there is no photo available. and like the other set of 3 Magic School Bus DVDs, there is no descripton. what are the names of the 3 DVD's? what episodes are on each DVD?i would like to buy as many episodes as possible without wasting my money and duplicating my purchases.i would like to thank the person who reviewed the other 3 DVD set and told us the names of those 9 episodes.too bad amazon didnt think to do that themselves."
5,Bet for kids,"The magic school bus are kids classics....no matter what their ages, children pick up great science info in these videos...Ms frizzle rocks"
3,Great Shows But Nothing New Here,"Just wanted to point out that the Magic School Bus is still shown on The Learning Channel and Discovery Kids every morning. The only episode that may be hard to find is the holiday special, which you can probably buy separately or check the TV schedules.This set may still be a good value if convenience or getting on DVD is important to you, or if you don't get the cable channels, but there doesn't seem to be anything new or unique here.The TV shows are also shown commercial-free with short cartoons or song skits in the resulting time between programs. If setting a VCR or Tivo to record every day isn't too much hassle, you can build up quite a library on the cheap. We managed to get all the episodes on tape a couple years ago. My 6 and 8-year-old boys still enjoy watching them."
1,Is it better to buy this DVD set than buy it separately?,"Hello, was wondering if the DVD set has any special bonus features. When you buy the DVDs that are contained in this set separately, the total comes to $21, as compared to $35 to buy the set together. I was wondering if maybe buying the set has some bonus items that you don't get by buying it separately.Thank you to to the customer who listed out ALL the episodes and DVD titles contained in this set!!! It was a lot of help."
5,The students in my second grade class love these videos,"I use them when we study certain units. For example, we do a unit on sound. And the Museum episode works well with helping explain echolation in a fun way. They get review of what we have read about and done experienments on and they don't even know they are reinforcing their learning. Very engaging shows that are easy to build into learning units. The Space Adventures works well into the learning standards for 2nd grade science on planets as well."
2,"Good Cast, but raspy sound","What was I thinking? the original recording is so old that the sound quality is really bad. It's not the manufacturer's fault, I just didn't do enough research. You'd be better off buying a recording with a less known soprano but with better sound quality"
4,The Goddess,"I have to say that Callas, for me, despite all her versatility, has a voice that reminds me of these kinds of roles- Lady Macbeth, Abigaila or Tosca. ""Hard and shouting roles"". This recording proves me right, because rarely her voice sounds so adequately casted. She is absolutely brilliant. Baritone Macbeth is very expressive vocally as well, and the tenor is of a very interesting dramatic voice color. The quality of sound can be disapointing for those who are looking for an opportunity to enjoy the grand energy of ""Macbeth"", but that is not the prime purpose of this recording. Value it as a fantastic opportunity to expirience atmosphere in which a real diva and real opera lovers spent a wonderful and memorable night."
3,Verdi: Macbeth,"While not on the level on the level of the sound quality of a recent digital recording, it is good, and its historic value makes up for the sound quality. I am glad I bought it."
5,Callas & Lady Macbeth: A Perfect Match,"This is an opera that EMI should have recorded with Callas in the studio, but it never happened, so we are lucky to have this recording of the 1952 live performance from La Scala. While the sound is boxy, dry, and lacking in range, it remains listenable and the ear quickly adjusts. Callas is an Amazonian Lady Macbeth, and it's a thrill a minute. Her voice, as heard here, is huge, powerful, and completely steady as she spews venom at every turn. The effects achieved by Callas on this performance are easier heard and experienced than discussed. Not surprisingly, the Macbeth of Enzo Mascherini is not on this level, but he manages a creditable performance in a role that should have been cast with Tito Gobbi (the only Macbeth who would have met Callas on equal ground). Victor de Sabata conducts a dramatic and searing performance. For Callas fans, this set is an absolute must."
1,extension wand,The wand only fits washers up to 2300 psi and won't work on my 2650 psi washer. I can't find anywhere where it says this in description. Unable to mate to tips or hose.
4,Well made accessory,"The price seemed a little high for 4 pieces of pipe, but the finished product is impressive. A little heavy for 1 handed use, but it definitely increases the value of the washer. It would be better if you could utilize just one section of extension, rather than 2."
5,Gets the Job Done.,"I purchased the Karcher Electric Pressure Washer after getting quotes from local pressure washers, which were ridiculous. One guy quoted me $269 before he even saw the house. The pressure washer works great, but the only issue that I had was getting to the second floor. So I purchased the Karcher 4-Piece Extension Wand. I thought that it may leak or lose pressure. It maintains the water pressure as if it was not extended. Not only that I almost could reach the top row of siding on my house without a ladder. The Karcher 4-Piece Extension Wand is well worth the cost."
1,Product and Power Spray Unit Do not match,No where in the product presentation does it say this product does not fit on my Karcher 3000psi unit. Would not it make a little sense to identify the units that this extension unit will not fit??
1,Little Pressure from the wand,"I bought this Karcher wand to clean the highest part of my pool cage in Florida and while water does come out the end, there is not enough pressure to clean anything. I have an 1800psi Karcher electric power washer and have plenty of pressure from my other wands. This wand might be good for light cleaning, but, if you are buying this to reach high places with high pressure, look for another product."
4,Karcher wand extension,I like the pressure washer quite a lot. The extension allows me to reach my upper eave above the garage door without pulling out a ladder. My only problem is that it is heavy when operating and I'm afraid a smaller person or a woman would have difficulty using it effectively. My wife couldn't. It provided a very good cleaning action despite the length. I like it fine.
5,Very good product,"Outside of being way over priced, the extension wand kit is an excellent addition to our pressure washer and allows access to areas w/o the use of a ladder. The screw threads on the extension pieces are plastic, but since I'll be the only user I think they'll survive if I handle w/ care. A more realistic price would be $ 15-20. The wand should expedite the cleaning of our vinyl siding."
1,ugh!,"...the description does not say or specify anything... should be ""4 PIECE EXTENSION SPRAY WAND FOR ELECTRIC PRESSURE WASHER"" because this item does not work for all Karcher pressure washers! we have a gas powered pressure washer and the pieces don't fit! ...called Karcher and they said they do not make extension sets for gas powered ones... why is this? no one can give me an answer! I wonder who's bright idea that was? ...makes no sense why it is available for one and not the other. ugh!--had no problems returning it to Amazon.com however which was awesome!"
1,No pressure,Despite the other positive reviews this product did not proform even close to my expectations. Once connected I had no pressure. It provided nothing more than an extension of my regular water hose. I am returning this product.
2,Arduous and inconvenient,"Yes, this product will allow reach into difficult areas;however,removing and installing induvidual segments is difficult. In fact, even if careful, it's easy to strip the cheap plastic threads which join the segments together. Furthermore,I found removing and installing the product from the body of the gun an absolute chore! There are other inconveniences not as frustrating - particularly when used with that cheaply made but expensive, poorly designed adjustable head brush, but you probably get the idea. Bottom line - if access is difficult, it's worth it; BUT if you intend to change the segments, attachments (especially the brush), or the extension itself often, expect an agravating, frustrating experience. And if you intend to use it often, forget it!"
1,pressure washer problem,I purchased this product several months before I intended to use it. When I tried to use it it would not attach to my pressure washer. A long time had passed since I bought it. I did not try to exchange it. Is that still possible?
2,Disappointed,"Did not work as expected! It does provide an extention to the reach of the washer BUT the power is not good at the nozzle. Guess it looses the power on the way up the long tube. Without the extention I still have great power for washing the deck. Anyway, while I can now reach the pool cage supports over the pool, I still can't get them clean only wet. Not worth the price."
5,Perfect for me :),"I love these condoms! The latex is strong and I have never had one break on me. They are the only brand I have found that properly fit my below-average size. I can honestly say that without these condoms I would not be able to enjoy sex. Thanks to Iron Grips I can enjoy the moment instead of worrying about my condom slipping, bunching up, or breaking. I look forward to using these condoms for many years."
5,I will be buying more.,"I bought the 12 pack after reading reviews all over the net on how this brand would be the one. Well it is the ONE, amazed at the tight fit, no slide and I will be buying more ASAP..."
3,It is adequate if it is what you need to work or fit properly.,"I help with a ""natural birth control clinic, I tried them so as to give my opinion to what they were like. I am a MD, and I wanted to make sure that I could stand behind them as the need to distribute them came. I have seen a lot of guys junk, but I was looking for a OSFA condom, for those with average penis size. I am in the larger average size range and these things were so tight that it was actually painful. I usually only give these to younger men and those with smaller members. If that is what you have, these are perfect. If you are average size or better, stay away from them."
1,this condom breaks!!,This condom sucks !! The condom is very thin and it broke a lot of times. Had to spend a lot of money on Plan-B :-) :-). Threw the whole buch to the trash. Use it at your own risk. I won't recommend this !!
2,Everything was good but...,"Size, price and fitting are perfect.But the grease on condom was gone within 5 min after using.Because of that, I have to use about 2 or 3 condoms in only 1 sex.That was very interrupting.If you are a man who can finish within 5 min, I will recommend this."
2,not even worth 3 bucks.,"Well first of all i got it 4 days late. they didnt come in the original box, they were stuffed in an envelope. And i only got 10 not 12."
2,This was not what I expected...,"I agree when saying that the size, price and fitting are perfect. I even received them in the mail right away! But my lesbian partner and I bought these so that we could use them with a few of our sex toys, and for a couple of 22 year old girls, 5 minutes of pleasure is just not enough. The condom runs out of lubrication and starts to become uncomfortable after a few minutes of using it. They are very thin and seem to be risky if being used for actual protection purposes. Gentlemen, do your ladies a favor- Please don't buy these."
3,LATE and SHORT,I order 108 and received only 104. They were 3 days late. The good thing was the expiration dates were far in the future.
3,TOO TIGHT,"If your goal is to have a condom that NEVER comes off then this is the condom for you. Other than that I cannot recommend them. You simply cannot feel much with these condoms. ""Iron Grip"" is an accurate statement because they are so tight that it just wasn't pleasurable. Granted, I am not HUGE by any means but these were too tight. I will say this, I had NO concern that they would come off. They stuck like glue. But after a while of no sensation...you get the picture."
3,Tight!!,"The condoms were very tight for me, but for sure they stay on! The only reason I gave it tree stars because it will not expand."
4,Really tight,"These work well if you are wanting something really tight or are very small. I was expecting just what the product description says, a little more of a ""snugger fit"", but these are very very tight. The product description should be ""Tight Fit"". Anyhow they're cheap and worth a try if you think you're small enough for them. Quality control seems to be good and overall a solid product, just a lot tighter than expected."
5,Investing in less then a week-Great book with Excellent INFO,"I read this book in less then a week and I am already putting together a purchase proposal following this books examples. It has many great ideas and explainations of how to flip properties, using first and second mortgages to benefit you, using home equity, taking a mortgage from the seller when they have 100% equity. I have been a minor in real estate for a few years, but this book has opened my eyes to new ways and techniques that I wish I knew many years back.Jack Cummings is a great author, easy to read and follow. Nice short chaperts."
2,Good for Starters,"If you have not been really exposed to real estate investing this is probably a good book to understand how you can work with OPM (other people's money). However, for the more advanced investor it is quite disappointing. I would not even recommend it as a ""refresher"" course."
3,Lauri puzzles are great for kids,"You can never go wrong with Lauri puzzles. The bright foam pieces make them easy to pick up and place for little fingers. The larger puzzle pieces are smaller and approrpiate for 4 to 6 years old. I have bought these puzzles for all of my grandchildren. Age appropriate would be 18 months to 6 years. The transportation pack is pretty useless except to place them on a shelf. Forget the transportation pack and buy the puzzles!And remember, Lauri replaces any lost pieces free!"
1,Very poor Panasonic product,"This is the worst product I have ever purchased from Panasonic. The first one came very damaged, the foam packing was in many pieces. It worked fine for four (4) days and burned up in huge puff of black smoke. Amazon replaced in promptly. the second unit lasted 18 days before it burned up. Amazon took both units back and credited my account in a timely manner. This product to say the least was a major disappointment. In the past, Panasonic has always been premium quality."
4,Acceptable.,This is a very beautiful looking item. Has been working for close to 3 years so far and has only needed to be repaired once. It seems like the internal components go poof once in a while and they need replacement. An extended warranty is required when buying these things.
5,Catching up with The White Train,"Keeping up with The White Train is both exciting and enjoyable. This cinematic novel was formed with friendly and succinct chapters, which the reader couldn't resist to turn to the next page. Larry Purcell's The White Train is a book that required many extensive hours of research. The accurate depiction of artillery, airplanes, American Indians and the ACTIONS really broadcasted the verisimilitude of the story. Just who are the Ghost Dancers, and who is the real conspiracy? The subterfuge will be revealed in the end. My favorite parts of the book were learning about Aliquipiso (the warrior maiden of Oneida), and how I became aware of the fact that the Native Americans still don't have their own holiday. Purcell surely made the job of espionage sound like a thrill of a lifetime!"
2,Lacks deep insight and presidential detail,"This book is first hand account of several activities during Harding's Presidency and rise to the Presidency. It also is a recounting of several of his life's events throughout the early part of his life. It is mildly entertaining and interesting read about his travels, but this book fails to capture the details I was looking for in a biography. I have read a biography of every President starting with George Washington all the way through Warren Harding, and this book is one of the worst at detailing the complexities and politics that accompany a President throughout his political career. I would not recommend this book."
3,Mostly Average Collection Of Songs,"I remember being introduced to the music of E-Z-O by seeing their three videos they released off of this album years ago. I always thought that their kabuki makeup was a pretty good idea--they looked like nobody else. The band's music had an original edge to it on this album, but the songs are still just average. There are some nice guitar parts on here though, and Masaki has a unique voice. ""Here it Comes"" and ""Kiss of Fire"" are the best representations on this debut album. But most of the songs just don't say much and are pretty forgettable. An okay release."
4,Finally,"Took forever for the second CD to be released (first was in 1998); not as good as the first in my opinion, but still worth buying. Much more mellow than Sympathique."
5,"LOVE PINK MARTINI; THEIR NAME HAS A ""BLING RING"" ...","I'm much better at book reviews than I am at music. Being a grandmother and (I confess) a great-grandmother, I didn't expect any of today's music to move me ... or even impress me.BUT ... this album did it! I can't say--as one reviewer said-- that every song is pitch-perfect (my hearing isn't that good anymore), but I CAN say that I liked what I heard.I have never had a martini in my long life, but I'm even sold on the name of these talented musicians. It has a ""Bling Ring"" to it!"
2,Not nearly what we got from the first...,"After such a stellar debut, this collection is a major disappointment. A shame given the very long wait between projects."
4,Technically brilliant if a little fey,"If anything, this snappy little band from Portlasnd has become more musically proficient in the seven years since their debut album ""Sympathique."" The collaborations with the musicians who have inspired the band's gifted impresario, Thomas Lauderdale, pay off beautifully, and what was previously the band's weakest point--its vocals--have improved enormously: China Forbes, the lead chanteuse, has gained much greater control of her voice in the ensuring period between albums. The only drawback on this album is the prevalent sesnsibility, which comes through especially in the lyrics, and which can be at times too self-enchantedly fey (get a load of the title song, for instance) and self-consciously innocent. What seemed charming when the band members were in their late 20s now seems a little much now they're in their mid-30s. Still, this is highly pleasurable music that shows beautiful craftsmanship and musicality."
5,PM Fan - again!,"The CD just came out and I have listened to it 3 times. It gets better each time. The beginning is perfect Pink Martini with the last few songs a nice change, but equally orchestrated."
5,Great Music!,I bought this CD after I saw Pink Martini in concert at the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio! No one could possibly sit still listening to their music! The singer has a outstanding voice and the musicians are just awesome!! Looking forward to their new CD coming out May 2007!
5,Hang on Little Tomato,"I love this group and this CD does not disappoint. A unique mix of selections enhanced, as always, by the outstanding musical talent of the group."
1,This Little Tomato Will Need to Hang On,"You have to admire a group's self assurance that comes from a successful 1st album and rigorous touring schedule. Confidence alone, however, does not a winning vocal album make. Gone are the adventurous dynamically orchestrated tracks of Sympathique. In their place are peculiarly similar sad love songs, all sung in the style of Claudine Longet. What happened in the years since Sympathique? Did all the songwriters contributing to this work have the same lost love experiences? What happened to the excitement and creativity that gave us Sympathique? Cutting the band loose to write tunes was a great gesture, but in response to the lyrical question, ""Do you miss me, my darling,"" indeed we do. There's much to miss in this well intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying album. As for me, who purchased as gifts scores of Sympathique, I will indeed ""hang on..."" for hopefully a return to the real creative tracks of Sympathique."
3,Refreshing ...then tedious,There are a few standout songs on this CD. There are however more songs that I can't bear to listen to.
4,Uplifting,"I love how multicultural Pink Martini is! You'll sample flavors from different places and eras, and you'll fall inlove with their incredibly dreamy and fun album."
5,Great Listening,I love this CD as much as their first album. It's good listening for all occassions. You won't be disappointed!!
5,Good Stuff!,"The new Pink Martini album is fabulous - Sympathetique is a hard album to follow, but the band has delivered. If you ever have the chance to see Pink Martini live take advantage of the opportunity...they are true entertainers!"
3,Eh,"It's no Sympathique, but I'm not sure I can blame them. I listened to Sympathique an an almost daily basis from the day it was released until the day Tomato was released. I bought copies for a dozen people, each of whom bought copies for a dozen people. I saw them in concert and they are exquisite. You can't outdo Sympathique--it's flawless and timeless. Tomato has a few weak links, which is what sets it apart from its predecessor. I find myself skipping the French tracks and Lilly, and I've grown to dislike the Gardens of S&B.;If you're just discovering Pink Martini now, don't even think about missing out on Sympathique. Also, don't expect another album for a long time. Understandably, it takes a long time for such a large and talented group to make a record."
4,Good Listening,"When a friend suggested to me that I would enjoy this CD, I bought it. I wasn't disappointed. I think it's easy on the ears."
4,Wonderful!,"The follow up to Sympathique proves to be worth the wait!!Unique, eclectic, and FUN! Love it!"
5,LOVE this album!,"I discovered this band when I was given their CD second-hand, and I am so glad that I did! I can't get this ecclectic collection of catchy songs out of my head -- they're all just wonderful. The singers have fantastic voices and great style, and the overall level of musicianship on this album is excellent. I'm planning to order their other CD, and can't wait to hear it. Highly recommended!"
4,The best martini in town!,"Pink Martini has got to be the most imaginative and musically sophisticated amusement ride for the ears EVER!I am always astonished by the craft and the hilarity, not to mention the great tunes!I recommend this CD to everyone.Hooray for them!Amanda McBroom"
5,Pink Martini - hang on little tomato,Got the CD two days after the request. Great songs! My most favorite of all Pink Martini Albums
5,How will they top this one??!!!??,"Absolute Genius..... A masterpiece in every note. China Forbes has a voice comparable to any of the finest, richest in recent history, from any genre. Thomas Lauderdale is a contemporary Beethoven with a little Debussy thrown in for good measure..."
2,Sympathique Rehashed--Nothing Innovative!,"My gf and I eagerly listened to Hang On Little Tomato, but both of us came away disappointed. Sympathique was a masterpiece, a rich vibrant sound with amazing vocals. It was a whole new world of music.Having seen Pink Martini in concert and experiencing China's fabulous voice, both of us were really looking forward to hearing PM raise the bar once more.Unfortuately, in this aspect, the album severely disappoints. The majoritity of the melodies are slight variations of Sympathique with new vocals. The style of the music was exactly the same--but felt worse. Hang On Little Tomato feels like an album that just imitated the great Sympathique. It wasn't innovative, it wasn't fresh, and it's not stellar music."
5,Best party music EVER!,"We must have played this CD at least 5 times during my daughter's 21st birthday party. EVERYONE, aged 20 - 60, loved it!!"
2,it wasn't worth the wait,"like many of us, i too am a pink martini fan having gone to concerts all over the u.s. and purchased countless c.d. to give away and spread the gospel of pink martini. if tomato had been released within 8 to 12 months of the original i would have attributed the mediocre c.d. to 2nd c.d. jitters. the fact that we had to wait over 2 years, to give them the time to produce a masterpiece as good as or better than the original and then come out with this disappointing, lame follow-up is such a let down. let us hope that 3rd times a charm."
3,"Eclectic, Unique","This is great music - a unique blend of international sounds,this is just plain fun."
5,"Excellent activities, not only for use by the therapist","This series gives great assignments, which are great for para-professionals or parents to utilize between sessions. The age targeted activites are great, especially for the little ones. The categories of activities are helpful in determining what activites will be appropriate with goals the client is working on. I appreciate that there are mutliple activites for each target area. This allows me to work through a spectrum of approaches to the same issue. The kids seem able to relate to the stories in the exercises. I have found the activities helpful in beginning to get them to approach difficult subjects, without feeling like they are in the 'hot seat'."
2,"Very, Very, Slow","First of all, let me admit that I do not like stories where a child is in danger. But that's not my main objection to this book. It is just too slow.The basic plot: Married man murders girlfriend who had become too demanding, tries to place blame on mentally retarded young man, 9-year-old girl is only one who knows the real situtation even though she doesn't understand what she has seen. Doris Miles Disney is a competent writer but it takes her ages to lay out this simple plot. This book is only 156 pages long, but for me it seemed at least twice that long."
3,Not worth $80,"I bought these after reading several other reviews from different sites. I returned them the next day. They are simply not worth the money. Go to Home Depot and buy a nice $20 pair of work gloves (and add a very thin, useless layer of insulation) and you have the same thing.Also I read that these gloves run small in their sizing. I bought an XL (which I normally wear) and they were quite a bit too large for my hands. Since they are work gloves, they need to be on the tighter side to be useful. There is too much slack in the palm and the fingers are too long. I've read a lot of good things about these gloves, and maybe the size large would work better, but I was not impressed for a rather high price tag."
3,"Not a real ""BOOK""","I love Pitcairn folklore as much as the rest of us, but this book is primarily filled with pictures. If you are looking for a historical account of Pitcairn and The Bounty, I would keep looking."
3,Plays better than it reads,"This is not a play script in the traditional sense. This is part of the new trend of director-centered theater, where concept is all. In this case the concept is a pool, where several of Ovid's tales of strange-changes-in-the-night take place in and around. This is one of the better examples of concept theater, and it won many awards on Broadway (but not for script). Reading the original Ovid is preferable to reading descriptions of how the pool should be lit, or what music plays through scene changes. But seeing it? If done right, this material could be incredibly visually striking.I'd advise stage directors to take a peek. This is director-friendly material. Actors, playwrights, and general readers I'd steer towards Ted Hughes' TALES FROM OVID."
2,"Weak - boring, not up to Iced Earth standards","This is only for HARDCORE fans of Blind Guardian and/or Iced Earth. If you have every iced earth CD (as I do), then this will come across as very boring, bland, material. Jon, please return to your day job and re-enlist Barlow. This Hansi Kursch guy cannot sing either."
2,Boring cd!,"Very dissapointing album for true Iced Earth and Blind Buardian fans!!! Nothing like ""Heaven Denies"" and ""Blood On My Hands"" from their debut album. So the bottom line is, this is not worth buying!"
4,Side Project,"This is the second album by Demons & Wizards, a power metal side project by singer of Blind Guardian and Iced Earth's guitarist. Bobby Jarzombeck, best known for his work with Halford, is the session drummer here. Led Zeppelin's Immigrant Song is covered on this album. There are plenty of high pitched vocals. If you're a fine of black/death/power metal, this is a solid album. Key tracks are: Crimson King, Terror Train, The Gunslinger, and Dorian. I would recommend it."
4,good but lacks power of a power metal band,"i like their version of the immigrant song.certain songs do need work. overall a good album,a good listen. it is preferable to the modern sissy metal bands of today you know. coming from a danzig,rammstein,entombed,biohazard,agnostic front,techno-metal and industrial background"
4,NOT BAD!,"This is a great buy for your money...the recording is clear and Anne Sophie-Mutter easily handles the somewhat tricky violin work. Brahms was never really known for his violin sonatas but this is some of his best composing next to his third symphony, if you liked Vivaldi""s ""Manchester Sonatas"" you will like this also."
1,Some serious errors,"I got this book to offer to a non-portuguese speaking person, and I'm glad I took a look at it first. I don't know from where the translators are, but there are pretty serious errors in that book. For instance, belly button is umbigo and not tecla da barriga. Cookie is bolacha and not bolaicha. The verb to be, in portuguese, is ser and not s√©r, among others. One that I found is not even a word in portuguese! Something indispensable is imprescind√≠vel, no impres√≠ndivel.The structure of the book is quite accessible, is the poor translation that ruins it. Maybe the editor should be more aware."
1,Another useless book for travel in Portugal,This book is designed for Brazilian Portuguese but even with that in mind my fiancee who is Portuguese noticed many mistakes in this book and called it useless and said to return it. Save yourself money and look under European Portuguese if you are traveling to Portugal.
4,In Mozambique,"I am using this book in Mozambique. I am on a work assignmwent and also for socializing. I like the way the book is organized in different useful sections, such as chatting, quite helpful when trying to converse with my lady friend. However, the dictionary is way too limited,many words I want are not in there. It should be at least twice as many words. but otherwise it goes with me everywhere."
1,DONT BUY IT,"Dont waste your money on this one. the picture is cute. but the quailty of the toy isnt any good. the frosting doesnt even stay in the hole and the box is flimsy it would never last with a child. the concept is supposed to be like the game memory,your supposed to turn over the donuts and match the ones with the same frosting. your better off just buying the real memory game. the only thing this is good for is the pretend food concept and even with that it isnt worth this price."
2,Very low quality for learning resources!,"Let me start by saying: We are big fans of learning resources toys. BUT, this product is very poorly made! The box is complete garbage, it is such thin cardboard it literally went directly into the recycling pile. The tops to the donuts don't all stay on anymore either so when you turn them upside down to play the game the top falls off. These ended up in our ""toy food"" bin and have barely been played with. I am disappointed because I usually love this brand so much. In this case I think buying the Melissa and Doug Donuts would have been a better buy."
4,Lots of fun!,"This is such a fun product. My 2 and 4 year olds like to pretend they are serving doughnuts to mommy and daddy.I really like all of the Learning Resources Smart Snacks great play food with an educational twist. The only disapointment was the cardboard box they are to be stored in. I didn't even give it to my kids because it would have been ruined in seconds. Beware the doughnuts are hollow and if really bitten into, they will ""dent""."
4,Gift,The Smart Snacks Mix and Match Doughnuts was a gift for my great nephew and he played with it as soon as he opened it up...he loves it!
2,ANOTHER FAILED NOVELTY ITEM,"This recording and Gardiner's complete Mozart concerti with Bilson are failed experiments. In the laughable Mozart recordings he even makes matters worse by insisting that the piano be ""just another instrument"" in the orchestra. So we have a ""copy"" of a primitive fortepiano recorded at a considerable distance. Can this be how Mozart expected to make his name and fame, playing a toy piano way off in the background? It sounds like someone plucking rubber bands. Later fortepianos (e.g. the Grafs from the 1820's) began to develop some tone and volume. But even they cannot hold their own against a full orchestra.A more interesting experiment than this recording is Levin's recording of a chamber version of Beethoven's 4th with a handful of accompanying instruments. It's no substitute for the real thing, but at least it works on its own terms."
3,"Good orchestra, but why a period piano ?","A lot has to be said in favor of this recording, e.g. the excellent orchestra that makes Beethoven sound as fresh as it gets and has the right size. But no matter what the ""authentic performance"" people say, the use of a period piano was the wrong choice. The piano part sounds dreadful. Given the fact that we will never be able to ""really"" reconstruct how this music sounded almost 2 centuries ago (and should we ?), we may as well use a modern concert grand and make the piano part sound satisfactory. I like most of Gardiners recordings -- it's just that he sometimes takes things too far, and this is an example. So we can only hope that Harnoncourt finally gets to record the Beethoven concertos..."
4,"Fresh, comprehensive, and unusual","It's not easy to find a really good book about making rubbings. In fact, this is the only one I've seen.This art form is accessible to almost everyone, yet few realize the resources around them.""Making Paper & Fabric Rubbings..."" covers a wealth of ideas and techniques. You'll enjoy this at home, but especially as you travel. If you keep a diary or journal, you'll find wonderful new ways to illustrate it with rubbings. If you're a fabric artist, rubbings can be great material for unusual quilts and wall hangings.Even better, once you start making rubbings, you'll look at the world in a different way. You'll notice more than colors and shapes, but also textures.I go through a lot of books. Some delight me at first, and then I don't refer to them again. This one is a keeper."
3,Intriguing Art Form,Rubbings of Gravestones have been an art form for centuries and Ms. Firestein has researched her medium thoroughly. I just wished she had gone into more detail on how to begin. She needs to include details for first-timers. Her instructions were very sketchy and hard to follow.
5,Darling,"What can I say? I remember reading little golden books (at my grandma's) when I was a child, and when I caught sight of this, it made me smile. Not just the fact that it's a little golden book, but that the illustrations are a throwback to those books, with a retro, simple feel. Not like the gorgeous animations of (and in) the film itself, but charming. This is a short book, but it's so sweet. It's simply darling. If you love the film and are collecting things from it, or just want to buy yourself a nice little inexpensive gift, go for this book. You'll be on your way."
3,Not the Story of the Movie,Many Golden Books taken from Disney movies tell a simplified story of the movie as expected - but not this one! This book tells a sweet story about a growing friendship between a bear and a cub. But everything else from the movie has been discarded. This book would be suitable for early readers who would like to read a charming friendship story. Just don't buy it expecting it to follow the movie's storyline!
2,Wake me up when you're done writing,The sound you hear as you read this review is me snoring as I once again attempt to read this book.I find it to be a snoozoid...but there is some context that would be valuable.If your sales position is working with a handful of key accounts you should buy this book. Assuming you can read through it and not fall asleep it will likely be of value to you.
3,Boring movie,"Quite boring, but the DVD was only a few dollars. When I did not receive the DVD, the seller shipped out another one, but the shipping did take about 7 to 10 days."
3,Surprisingly Good,"My five year old son watched this film at Christmas and I sat with him by the fire. Have you seen the back of the video? It looked like a re-hash of the first story but much worse - adventures like ""getting stuck in a bubble"" - ""So good you won't even see it at the cinema!"" I was expecting it to be so bad, but sat through it with my son, dreading having a rubbish afternoon.But all in all I was pleasantly surprised. My son laughed and had a good time - I didn't laugh much I have to say, but it's a kid's film. My son loved the first film (which we have had on video for years), didn't like the second one (""It didn't have any 'shrunking',"" he said), and liked this one second best. After renting it that day, we're now planning to buy it. Worthwhile if you liked the first (in my view a bit weaker though) and if you thought the second was a disappointment."
5,GREAT!,I was VERY surprised with the great condition of this product. There was even a old sticker from when the movie first came out in the VHS case! I'm very pleased with this product and how fast it shipped! :)
5,TINA TURNER,"LONG TIME 15 YEAR OLD TINA FAN WENT TO ALL THE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SHOW IF YOU DON""T HAVE THE LATEST CD OR A DVD PLAYER GET THIS BECAUSE YOU CAN HEAR MOST OF HER BIRTHDAY SPECIAL ALSO A TREAT TO PUT IN YOUR COMPUTER AND WATCH THE VIDEO .BRandon LOVE ~!!!!!!!AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
2,I don't get it.,"I have been rarely listening to this album since i bought it. The songs makes you bore especially after the sixth track. The live performances are amazing and they are one of the two reasons to buy the album. The other reason is the existence of the beautiful hit single ""When The Heartache Is Over"".I wish the album would include more hits like this song."
4,Lively and fun back-to-school rhymes and raps,My second grade students and I shared this book of poems during our first weeks together this year. They loved hearing the poems read over and over. The poetry is very 'today' and is a lot of fun to read and hear. The illustrations are colorful and lively. This book is a very nice addition to the back-to-school literature repertoire.
5,A great reference,"I got this book as someone who had used UNIX before, but this was many years ago, and I had forgotten a lot. This book is great for picking up the functionalities of various UNIX tools - the explanations are clear and concise. It also works very well as a quick reference. The bulk of the book is devoted to bringing you up from a potentially zero-experience user to someone who can work with ease with editors, shells, and more. Simple examples are included throughout. The back of the book has a 250-page command reference section for quickly looking up how to use a particular command. You could read the whole book and progressively work with UNIX as a self-taught course, or just reference the sections you need."
4,Good as expected!,"This author has become a sure bet for the books I've purchased from him in the past. The only thing I would mention is there is alot of repeated material in the separate titles. I own the ""Linux Commandline Shell practical guide"" and also the Red Hat/Fedora practical guide. There is probably more then three quarters of the content that is exact. I guess with all instances the OSes are the same but it is just difficult to spend fifty bucks on three or four books only to have som much repeated content.But as I said this author's books are very dependable!"
5,Buy this game!,This game is so fun!!! We usually play it at Christmas but we went ahead and bought it for ourselfs and we love sitting down and playing this! Buy it!
3,Works.......but.........,I agree with the first reviewer. It needs stiffer brushes on it. I tried using it with an extension wand. You can't put much pressure on the brush with an extension. I tried it washing my truck. It worked fairly well but not as well as I would have liked.One place I found it worked well was on dusty and dirty siding on our soffitts. It worked fairly well with that where I couldn't use much pressure.Doug
5,Works well,We used this rotating brush to clean our window sills and windows. It works well and didn't scratch anything.
5,A Very Good Accessory,"I purchased this item from Brand Variety through Amazon. It works like a charm and pivots to any angle for ease of use. I was surprised at the power of the rotating brush. It takes a lot of pressure force to bog it down and stop it from rotating. That being said it cleans very well. The quality of the bristles are nice too. They are not stiff and abrasive. Perfect for cleaning windows. This Karcher brush is quality made. It is expensive, but in this case you get an above average accessory. There is another rotating Karcher rotating brush out there that does not pivot. I purchased it locally before purchasing the pivoting brush through Amazon. For my needs the non-pivoting brush is useless except for very basic cleaning due to the fact that you can't angle it. The brushes are also much stiffer. If you need this type of brush do yourself a favor and buy the pivoting brush. You won't be sorry."
1,Rickenbacker Biography,"This book was rated as in Good condition. ""Not so much"" The binding was tattered and it had a library 92R on the front which makes it look like it was stolen from the library. There is dark blue streaks swiped across the entire outside pages and a lot of the first pages are striped to show that it is no longer wanted by the library. I cannot keep this book as it looks like I picked it up out of discard bin and yet I paid over $20.00 incl. shipping. I was very disappointed."
5,enjoyed learning about the man,always enjoy learning about people of American history especially those who honorably served our country. learned a lot about the man Rickenbacker that I didn't imagine.
3,Strange beginning,"This is a review of only the very beginning of the work, which is why I have awarded it a neutral 3 stars.Two different sinfonias are used in different performances of this work. Perhaps each is from one of the two existent surviving manuscripts. But this recording uses neither of the two. Instead it uses the sinfonia from The Return of Ulysses. That is puzzling and strange and requires an explanation."
3,Spanish for Gringos: Level Two,"Level Two is a real disappointment after using Level One. The engaging voice of the original teacher is gone and is replaced by two lesser voices. One of the voices is difficult to understand, which defeats the purpose of an audio lesson. In addition, the dreaded language lab tone is added in replace of the simple pause. Finally, the festive Latin music is gone. Overall, a disappointment and not as well done as Level One."
1,help~!!!!!,I got the DVD today and I have no clue how to play it!!!!I try and getting to the root manue but all I get is the commic book style stuff it just keeps repeating over and over!!!!can someone just post a how too!!!
2,Didn't like it,"In 3 short words: didn't like it. There was just tons of senseless smash-and-bash. Sometimes I forget why they suddenly start fighting. The character development was typical and very uninspired. I don't even really remember the storyline and I've watched the whole series. Don't get me wrong, though, this anime wasn't even supposed to be one of those crazy souped up fighting super hero anime. Avoid it unless you think you'll be interested by flashy character designs, typical characters, lots of manly yet meaningless bashing. I sat through many of the eps wondering why i was watching this and not something else..."
3,book presentation,"BELIEVE THIS... YOU'LL BELIEVE ANYTHING, 1975IT WAS IN PARADISE CITY THAT THE PAST CAUGHT UP WITH CLAYClay Burden had married his sluttish young wife, Rhoda, because he was tired of being on his own. Val had walked out on him, and if he couldn't have Val, maybe marriage would make him forget her. Six years later, working in Paradise City, Clay met Val again. Married to the powerful and sinister Henry Vidal, she had changed... still beautiful and passionate, still compelling... but tense and nervous, driven by odd fears and anxieties.When Clay left his job and joined the Vidal empire, what had begun as a sneaking feeling of unease hardened into stone-cold certainty. Val must be released from the hypnotic influence exerted over her by her husband, even if Clay had to murder to set her free.See more at http://jameshadleychase.free.fr"
4,"Not As Fine as Their ""Ecce Ancilla Domini""!","This is a good recording, and Pomerium is a very excellent group, with a very commendable aesthetic approach to this music. They are definitely Contra the dastardly ""English Choir Boy"" sound that destroys so many performances, even when young folks aren't involved ironically. But good as this is, it is just not up to the exquisite height of their performance of Dufay's ""Ecce Ancilla Domini"" Mass from years ago. That is just the most riveting and gorgeous performance. I am amazed that I cannot find evidence of it on a CD online. Can that even be possible. A tragedy if it was never rei-issued as the Ecce Ancilla is one of the great Dufay readings ever. I will treasure my old lp of it even more now."
2,Not too sturdy,"I received the Koala Baby bodysuits as shower gifts, and loved the little designs on the front. However, after washing them only three times, and normal use, the snaps came off the one bodysuit. The fabric didn't rip, rather, the prongs that attach the snap to the fabric just broke off. For the many times that a bodysuit will be worn, these just didn't hold up. Although extremely cute, they're not worth the money."
1,very old style of humor no longer funny today,This book is more about how to write Bob Hope style of jokes or the uncreative humor of the 1940's or so. It won't make anyone laugh today except maybe your grandpa or parents.
1,Schticky and dated,"Disappointing. Fundamentals may be sound, but the examples are extremely out of date (unless you think George Carlin and Lily Tomlin are up-and-comers and Danny Thomas is current). Reads like it was written by an old-timer, and the approach is largely shtick."
1,"Not simple, but simplistic.","Ugh. This book is the printed equivalent of being cornered by somebody's jabbering uncle at a crowded Thanksgiving dinner. It's useless to anyone seeking an organized and supported analysis of comedy writing, let alone instruction. This book is a bore and a mess."
3,Too long,"This is one of those books that are way too long than it should be. Very unfocused writing. Good ideas, but the author can't write. But three stars for a good analysis of what is comedy. Comedy is something with a surprise and something that makes you feel superior. The latter is so true and I never thought about it in that way...good analysis. The author really breaks down on the ingredients of a good joke. Good for anyone stuck and trying to create new jokes. But don't feel bad, Letterman has a team of writers that write his jokes, and he's still not funny."
4,Funny book for funny people but not for boring ones who want to be funny,"Well, even though this book has a bunch of types of comic writing tools, it doesn't really give a lot of tools how to make boring material funny. Sometimes the author would give an exercise, and I would have a hard type to come with something. While the book Comic Toolbox didn't have that many tools of comic writing, it was more encouraging and taught some valuable and technical stuff how to turn things around to make them hilarious, so the exercises were more fun to do, and produced better results. This book is the second book on comedy I've read so far, I'm sure I'll get back to it but for now I need something more basic because at times it was too overwhelming, or maybe I should just take up calculus."
3,"Think, Write, Act Funny?","This is a book about writing comedy, the act part of its extended title is not really promoted. If you want to write comedy, the book is ok."
3,Old hat but solid,This book might be a bit dull but I suspect that's the gap between the excitement we all feel about hearing a great joke and the reality that formal comedy writing requires plodding dedication. This book does feel a bit old (it was originally written in the '80's) but it does solidly cover the basics of one-liners. If you want something a bit more up to date (as of Nov 2010) try Logan Murray's 'Be a great stand-up' which has a good joke writing section and Sally Holloway's 'Serious Guide to Joke Writing' which is a whole book full of very modern joke writing techniques.
1,very painful read,"this book is very very boring. The humor it uses is very geeky. I hate professors especially when they write books. The text trying to explain concepts using outdated dorky humor, so if you want to understand the concepts you have to understand the stupid humor that the professor uses. Do not use the same humor on your friends if you dont want them to look at you dumb like you done lost your mind. So far, I did not get anything out of this book, other than wasting my time trying to read it."
4,Solid circuit workout,"I'm not a fan of HiLo .. or at least I wasn't until I tried Amy's style. This is not your hip-hop dance, nor is it your 'mom' style aerobics. Amy's HiLo is full of athletic drills. It is higher-impact, that can be modified to a low-impact with some previous experience. The cardio section, including the warmup (in which you will sweat) is about 20 mins. The rest of the workout is fun, different, and innovative takes with Amy's spin on weights and band work. You will feel it!"
3,Cardio Pump Step with Amy Bento,"A great feature of Amy's DVDs are the menu options-chapters, NRG mixes, longer or shorter workouts. This is an average workout, not extraordinary or memorable. Athletic moves on the step for the first half and then working with weights on the step for the second half. It's not really a total body sculpting workout, and the abs/core is just two exercises I believe. One of them is called the jack knife, and I honestly don't feel/see the purpose of this move?? For a similar (yet more intense) cardio & sculpt workout, I prefer Amy's A-TEAM BOOTCAMP."
2,Some Historical Areas of New Mexico,"This video covered some of the tourist spots in Northeastern, Northwestern and the Southeastern parts of New Mexico. I feel this was an ambitious task for a 35 minute video. If the video focused on only one of these areas, I think the viewer would have received a more comprehensive and less fragmented perception about this state. I also came away feeling that if I visited any of the areas shown, I'd have to stay the night at a pueblo or outdoors since there wasn't a hint of a contemporary hotel or motel in sight. This video is more historical than actually helpful to tourists."
5,very broad but very effective,"This book is surprising in its breadth of coverage (Python basics,Python advanced topics, MySQL, Apache/CGI and net infrastructure) andthe depth of coverage of each. It is a great single reference forcoming up to speed on each aspect such that you could actuallyimplement a medium-sized web application based largely onjust what is in the book. For those that are already familiar withany of these topics, that chapter can easily be skipped. This bookis not for the complete beginner though as it would be impossibleto cover so much ground if it were written with the Dummies mindset.Overall, it does a very good job explaining subtle points that anexperienced programmer would want to know as they attempted toimplement a first application with these technologies. Good job."
2,Where are they now?,"This books was a major disappointment. The ideas seem pretty solid, but the book no longer matches the code that is available online. The downloads are a mess. The book says to install slither using the instructions in the download, but there are no instructions in the download. Two users posted requests over a year ago for these instructions and the requests were totally ignored. In fact not much has happened over the past year. It really seems as if the authors have moved on. Slither seems to be dead.On another note - this book is very academic. For example, there is a couple of pages of discussion about the different theorectical ways to design databases. But my needs are so simple, that I already knew I was going to use MySQL, so I just did not care about this discussion. Unfortunately there are lots of discussions like that in this book. So if you just wanna get something done fast, this might not be the book for you."
3,I could have been a very good book,"This book had the right idea and its basic outline was well thought out. But when I tried some of the examples I found too many errors. There is no web site support for the errors in the code examples, or exercises by the author or publisher. So you are on your own.In all fairness, the book contains a good presentation to Python, Linux and MySQL, and a good basic explanation of the Internet, Apache and CGI. However, I think most of us learn best by trying out the exercises after reading the theory, and it is here where the book is weak. Because there are too few complete exercises, many errors, no errata, and lack of web support I cannot recommend this book. Also, some of the exercises require the ""Slither"" libraries, which do not seem to be supported any longer. Furthermore, I haven't been able to find a place to download the code in this book."
1,"""Steelbook"" really means Steel Youre Money!!!!!","The first DVD was great, but after that the rest of them ended unplayable! The ""SPECIAL STEELBOOK CASE"" managed to cause a crack on each DVD that went from the inner ring outward in to the disk media area! I had to order an entire new set, NON-STEELBOOK. DO NOT BUY THIS SET IF IT IS IN THE ""SPECIAL STEELBOOK CASE""!!! Get the standard version."
3,"Entertainingly Lame, sometimes","I enjoy odd tv shows, but this usually puts me and my husband straight to sleep. Although one of the guys, Dr. Ted, is pretty handsome. I wonder what he is a Dr. of? Anyway, I digress. Sorta lame, sometimes funny. One episode has a witness, a guy in his mid forties who lives in his parents basement. Totally credible, yes? Not to mention, they have and end segment, a wrap-up, that says ""file XX - CASE CLOSED!"" haha. As if they found real scientific evidence. Watch if you have extra time and an extra $2."
2,Great Show. Lame DVD.,"I love ""UFO Hunters."" Whatever you believe about UFOs, this show offers up some great brain candy, and keeps getting better as the seasons progress. History Channel is psyched to have this show.So was I, until I put in the first disc only to find that this $36 4-DVD set isn't even anamorphic. The show is beautifully shot in hi def with a 16x9 frame, and looks fantastic in broadcast. Even in standard def, there's no reason the 16x9 image on these discs shouldn't fill my 16x9 screen... instead, the picture is windowboxed--small with a thick black border. This is ridiculous, especially considering that so much of UFO research depends on pulling detail out of low-resolution video... der.History Channel... that's messed up."
1,Big Production That Goes NOWHERE,I feel sorry for the people who paid $35.00 for this as these stories go absolutely nowhere. Each of these episodes ends negatively with nothing to show but a lot of wasted money. The funniest part of this whole show is their leader Bill Burns. He has this nervous eye twitch thing that really makes him look like a first class nut. They finally slap a pair of colored glasses on him to try and hide this...LOL. I only paid $6.89 for these DVDs (new) so I don't feel too bad. I doubt I'd even pay that for future seasons. I can't beleve the History Channel actually threw funding at this project. Their other UFO DVDs are so much better.
4,Great Hip Hop CD,"If you are a fan of underground Hip-Hop, check out ""Illustrations"" by the Ill Relatives. This CD contains head bopping tracks like ""Love Music"", ""The Big Head"", and ""U Think It's A Game"" to mellow tracks like ""Fat Meat Is Greasy"" and ""Situations"". Yet all the tracks demonstrate the thoughtful and versatile lyrical styles of the group's MC's. The guys kind of remind me of Common because they actually have something to say when they rap, and they find slick ways to get their point across. So after you buy your Ludacris, Jay-Z, and Outkast CDs, run out and get ""Illustrations"". It contains all the elements that a true Hip Hop fan would like."
4,Iranian eye opener,"I was surprised by what I found inside, and a bit shocked. Iranhas two cultures living within each other. There is a desperate airof frustration of a people forced to live within the confines ofpolicies dictated by fundamentalism that is an uncomfortable fitgiven the history of the country. Definitely recommend it."
3,Does not cover history of Master Divers,"Although the book is Okay, it does not cover some to the great Salvage Master Diver's like Starky. I wish they spent more time on research to show where we got our start not how we got to the end."
3,Awkward stopwatch feature,"I had a good old Ironman watch from the 90's that finally got misplaced. I got this as a replacement & was surprised to find how slow and awkward the stopwatch is -- all this ""holding down to clear"" stuff really makes it impractical if you are timing an event, or intervals, etc."
4,Best of the Available Maps,"This map was even better than the National Geographic map, which was the only other decent map available. Even so, there were few to no route numbers (but maybe the roads HAD no numbers, that's a distinct possiblity....), and not enough elevation figures....only the mountaintops had elevation figures, and it was hard to judge other elevations just by the colors used to indicate topography...."
2,No way...,Very poor detail. I traveled to the Nicoya peninsula and was glad that I brought along another map. Maybe it's better for the more popular areas of Costa Rica but if you are planning on getting off the beaten path I strongly discourage you to get this map.
1,Poor Costa Rica map,This map was woefully lacking in detail. Thank goodness that it arrived after our vacation was over. I am glad we didn't have to depend on it during our stay. It is a no go if you are planning to do much driving.
4,"not great, but as good as commonly available","The ITP map is generally reliable in my experience, but the closer you look the less help it is. Don't count on it alone for back country travel or, for that matter, for suburban areas. It is not like an AAA map in the USA. It won't, for example, tell you if there's a bridge or a ford at remote stream crossings. That said, I have not found a better map of CR. The National Geographic map is good, too -- Better in some ways, especially topographic detail, but omits many tiny villages, etc found on the ITP. I now carry both."
5,"Sturdy, good quality map.","My wife and I visited Costa Rica for 11 days. We had a hotel booked for the 1st. night only, after that we had highlighted several spots on the map that were interesting to us. In a country where roads are not well marked and we had not been to before we put about 600 miles on our rented Jeep and were only lost twice for a few minutes each time. I think my wife only asked me to stop and ask for directions once, and you know that real men just don't do that! The map was well used and it is still in very good condition. It will accompany us on our next trip to Costa Rica.Have a great trip, it's a wonderful place."
2,"Good cartography, bad construction","I have to second the two-star review by Amanda. While the cartography is good (easy to read, nice colors), the map itself is extremely fragile along its folds. Even when I first opened it there were perforations that were large enough for light to shine through. These, of course, turned into splits. Probably okay for a short trip, but don't expect this to last you a long time. Maybe tryWaterproof Travel Map of Costa RicaorNational Geographic Costa Rica Adventure Map, both of which are waterproof as well."
2,Worn out before the trip began...,This map split at the seams within the first couple of times of laying it out.
5,Good investment if...,"This is a very comprehensive map, but unless you'll be doing a lot of driving, the rental car one would suffice. For people spending lots of time in CR, this one will be plenty durable!"
5,Great for the Price,This is the cheapest set you're going to find around.It would be nice if the head phones actually used a 'headphone jack (small audio output)' but Sony is at fault for that.Anyways as always just check the Shipping Price before you buy the product:)
2,"They work, but are uncomfortable...","I don't care for bluetooth sets, so my choices for wired products are limited. The headphones work okay, but they are uncomfortable for extended use."
2,Replaceable headphones work well,"I use the set that came with my phone on my motorcycle, and the good thing about them is they form a good seal with the ear to keep out outside noise and let me keep the volume at a reasonable level. Also, unlike this pair, the earphone part can be replaced by standard earbuds or even headphones, which just plug into the handsfree/microphone part using a standard stereo mini-plug. Then the microphone plugs into the phone itself with the proprietary jack you see in the picture. This set doesn't have that feature, so you're stuck with the earbuds that it comes with. Get the cingular set if you can."
1,"Its a crime to sell Crime Story, the way it was Copied.","I bought the whole set of Crime Story. Some of the tapes contain four to six one-hour episodes. The problem with this is that all these tapes (except for the Pilot episode) are recorded in EP. Most of these tapes contain minutes to hours of untrackable video tape. I own 4 Video recorders and all these tapes could not be adjusted by tracking. Its too bad because I would be more than willing to pay a lot more money for a set, if it was recorded in sp.I think Crime Story is great, thats why this is so frustrating. Buyer Beware !"
1,SOOO BAD AMAZON!!!,"This very expensive faucet arrived so beat up! It wasn't from the shiiping, it was packed up perfectly, someone shipped it of that way. Looked like it had been used and returned. It was all scratched up and dented. Not to mention, did not even look like the picture! Amazon said this was non-reurnable, but they did let me return it after a call to customer service. I had to pay for shipping & insurance, but Amazon reimbursed me the expenses. Overall, super bummed and ended up ordering my faucet from [...]"
1,partial shipment,"I can't really rate this item because, I never did get the whole package. I called to verify the order and was told everything was in the package and ready to ship. When I got the package, it only had one spring in it. Then I was told they did not know when the rest of my package would be here. I can't really fault amazon. They refunded my money very quickly and apologized. I'm sure, that if I had received everything that I had ordered, this would have been a good purchase."
3,Not Better than Simple Green,"I bought this mainly to use for spot treatment on clothes that have oil stains, ones from spending too much time in the kitchen without an apron.I tried the recommended mix of 50% water and 50% solution, pre-soaked for 30 minutes before washing, also tried 100% solution for pre-soaking and that could not get rid of the spots.On the other hand simple green gets rid of most cooking oil spots and is much more effective at removing stains of plastics which I also tried with this product."
1,Did not work,I tried removing oil/brake fluid stains with this degreaser on my brick driveway. I followed directions and after that did nothing to remove the stains I tried pouring the product full strength. This product did not work for me. I have since purchased and used Zep Citrus Degreaser (Amazon)and it worked beautifully.
1,Doesn't do what it was intended to do,"This was highly rated to eat oil form a variety of surfaces like concrete. Didn't work for me, maybe if you have a drop of oil it might work. I used the entire contents over a period of a month, even scrubed it with a heavy duty brush. Anything more than that save your money or get muriatic acid."
3,Wanted to clean oil from my decking,"Hired help stained our brand new composite deck with the stain/sealer that was being applied to the cedar railing. Trek (brand name of decking) recommended this product. When used as directed, all it did was fade the decking boards, the oil stains remained. Crud Cutter was also used to no avail. Anyone have any good suggestions?"
5,Cleaned all the oil off my concrete garage floor.,My minivan has had a slow oil leak for the past 6 months and has created a larger spot of oil drips on my garage floor.I thought I would give this stuff a try.I sprayed it over the oil covered concrete and let it sit for a minuteand then wiped it up with those blue shop paper towels.I repeated this process probably 5-6 times and it got all the oil up.I noticed on the bottle that this was a concentrated formula that was meant to be diluted.For motor oil it said to use a 1 to 1 ratio with water.So I just filled a separate spray bottle with water and sprayed them together on the stain.
3,not so much,"I just gave a review for the orange ""oil eater"", was told by a friend that it removes water spots off of windows,(I wasn't sure which oil eater the friend was talking about, so I purchased both) it does not..its an ok cleaner, but too expensive for what it does.We did use it in a capet shampooer, and it worked ok, so guess for the price of carpet shampoo, and diluted as told, it works good. Its a good cleaner, just too expensive, 409 works as well.(although I don't use 409 in my carpet shampooer.)"
2,DIDN'T WORK,"I GOT THIS PRODUCT TO GET SOME GREASE STAINS OUT OF SOME OF MY WORK SHIRTS. THIS PRODUCT IS SUPPOSE TO REMOVE GREASE FROM JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING, DID NOT WORK ON MY SHIRTS, BUT, IN ALL HONSTRY NOTHING ELES I HAVE TRIED WORK EITHER."
2,oil eater,This didn't get the oil spots off of our driveway that is not yet a year old. I thought it would do a better job.
4,Great all-purpose product,"I have used this in its many dilutions all over my house. Stove, oven, bathroom, car, laundry, floor (hard and carpet), both inside and outside. I am interested in biofriendly products. This one, bamboo flooring, and BioBags are my favorites. I like that there is a refillable spray bottle. It was one of the few products that got the grime off the kitchen areas when moving into my current house.I would recommend good ventilation, not from toxicity, but I personally do not like the smell. In its lowest dilution it has a minimal odor. Other products have made me physically ill from the fumes, but this does not.Make sure you follow the directions in terms of dilutions and what surfaces are safe."
4,These dolls live in my room,"I think that Hasbro did an alright job with this 2pack of 12"" dolls....being a huge giJoe fan I tend to likeeverything hasbro has done with GIJOE and as for the comicbook i like that a lot as well......but i personally don'tthink that this snake eyes can compare the the one that cameout in 1994 <was it?> the blue and black doll with the greymask and goggles that figure was excellent....the Hall of fame collection snake eyes is bASED on my favorite version of the same figure. the Storm shadow in this set is pretty decent as well...I love the grappling hooks that came with this figure........but spy troops the movie isn't that great.I'm still waiting for them to make a new version of Crystal ball<cobra hypnotist> i'm one of a kind in the way that i actuallyhad that figure as a child and have one MOC today.....and i actually think he looks a little like Dr. Mindbender but i like both mindbender and crystal ball alike....."
1,wrong item,"I am very disappointed that they sent me the wrong products. I wanted this particular toothpaste and I couldn't find it at any retail stores, so I ordered it online after searching for it website to website. I finally found them and ordered three of them. When the package got here, it was the wrong items. The ones I got, I could have bought it at any retail stores. I wouldn't order those online paying shipping.Since I didn't want to paid the returning shipping cost, I just kept them. But I am very very disappointed."
1,would rather eat broccoli,"These things are just plain disgusting.If you are ever in need of emegency rope, get these, but otherwise I doubt they are fit for human consumption.It feels and tastes like eating soft plastic, and I would hate to think what they do to your insides.I have battled to even give some of these away, so they ended up in the trash can, where they rightfully belong!"
4,Rudy,"I am a big fan of track 14, _Rudy_, beautifully sung by the Be Good Tonyas. The song was written by Danny Dolinger whose music & performance is also well-worth checking out. He does great guitar work and writes songs with a social conscience - the kind of stuff I need to hear these days."
2,Missing Music A Disappointment,"I ordered this cd based on what I heard on Itunes, and for some reason many of the best tracks included there are not actually on this cd. I was very disappointed by the lack of tracks: it really detracted from the overall album. Songs like The Weepies' ""All That I Want"" would have made the album a little more heartfelt and fun. The cd is not without its merits though: Dido's track is beautiful, and the Barenaked Ladies are always entertaining ."
5,A Practical Guide,"I've used this book for a few years for tutor training, and I find it to be an excellent book. It starts out fairly slowly, and then it builds on previous chapters. In fact, on some occasions, because of time constraints and (sudden!)staffing shortages, I've simply handed the book to a new tutor and said, ""read this."" I have no idea where the ""feminist agenda"" is that the other reviewer mentions."
2,"Good, but...","Tutoring Writing by Donald A. McAndrew & Thomas Reigstad is a composite of methods in tutoring students in writing.At first, the book was good. It summarized my college education (my degree is in English and Education). It's always good to read about methods.As I read on, it read like a college term paper from a B plus student. It was concise, reviewed well, but... (the ""but"" kept showing up in my mind when I read it).Finally, the marker of bad writing came to pass. ""Feminism.""The scar of leftist agenda took over the book with an entire cry of how women (sepcifically ""feminism"") teaches us the best way to tutor teaching.Feminism is a political dance and has nothing to do with good writing. It would be the same as saying ""Conservatives teach good writing methods because, by nature, they..."" which would be just as false.Too bad the education world can't teach reality and just rely on leftist agenda to produce. It could have been a good book."
1,*.*,"Actual Air is wonderful. when i read berman's poem about Asimov, the retired cosmonaut in me surfaced and every ""wow"" that i ever felt in my heart when i was a kid reading science fiction sort of reactivated at once. the tone of his work - - his poems feel very ""virginia"": it has a delayed wit, a quietude, and a non-pace that seems to validate the assemblage of words beyond the idea of writing poetry. whatever that means. i find that when i read this book for a while and then pick up something else, my mind attempts to read the new text by performing the same little equations that i'd be performing when reading berman's poetry. i guess that's a testimony to this book's uniqueness and the resonance of berman's logic. i gave it four transparent stars... they seem to be far more rare around here, and therefore probably more valuable. buy this book!"
5,the Botany 500 of Charlottesville-inspired whimsy-rock,"There remains some question regarding my thorough completion of the tome, but none about the clarity of Mr. DC Berman's mystical vision, to wit: give a man a suit, he'll dress for a day, but give him a Botany 500 and he'll found Microsoft. Or something."
5,featuring the best 20th century description of rain,"Witty, wonderful stuff. Fans of Richard Brautigan should take note. Also take note: fans of waking up by accident. See 'The Night Nurse Essays' for pitch perfect description of rain and drowning in the 20th century. Late American 20th century."
5,I'm Not Poet Person,"But I know what I like, and I think this stuff is fun and funny.I'll have to check Bill Knott, Harrison Fisher, Jeff McDaniel and Ron Koertge-I may also enjoy reading their poetry."
1,Save your money - look at DeWalt,"I was looking to replace a 19 year old 9"" B&D; power miter box and after some considerable research, decided on this model.I have previous experience with Hitachi power tools and was expecting to receive a tool of comparable quality - instead what I received was a broken tool that is made in China.Amazon was great handling the return and got me a replacement right away, but the replacement saw was broken at the same location (the right adjustable fence was ripped from the base).Inspection of the aluminum casting revealed large occlusions in the material, leading me to believe that the entire base is made of the same substandard materials.I would stay away from this tool - look at theDEWALT DW716 15 Amp Double-Bevel Compound Miter Saw- it will cost more, but you will be infinitely happier with the quality of the tool and construction - plus it is made in North America."
5,Hitachi puts out another winner,"I am about 2 steps above the weekend woodworker. I tend to use Milwaukee, Hitachi, Jet, and DeWalt tools. I really like this little saw, I've only been using this one for about 3 months, but it's seen some extensive use in my new house. I have no qualms about the quality, and would buy it again. Hitachi customer service has been top notch every time I've ever had to call them as well. (Never had to call them about this saw, just saying)"
4,Great Saw !,"this is a great saw for the homeowner or for light commercial work. good fencing, adjustments are easily made and the laser guide works great. I mounted this saw on a rigid miter saw stand for one very functional unit.Don Guzzetta"
1,Not worth buying waste of money,"Picked up this on sale $100 off $199.00 with a FREE 18ga brad nailer rfrom the big blue store Lowes.Just doesn't have the power to cut through 2 x 4 or 2 x 6 ,it stalls out,jambs up.The pivot for angle cuts, the casting snapped of where the positive stop bolt is,I am very careful with my tools,do not throw them around.Really WEAK casting/quality control - poor design.I tried some JB weld to repair,now that broke again , JB would not stick to the metal.So I will dump this in the trash & buy a GOOD CHOP SAW ! Oh yeah the cheap brad nailer made it through half a job, maybe couple hundred brad nails,jambed all the time,design is also poor,the plate that tensions the clip of nails slides,ride up on the nails & jambs,resulting in no feed,frustration,nothing a 2 lb sludge hammer can't fix.Purchased a Bostich brad nailer - real happy with that tool."
3,Decent for the price,"I picked up this saw based on the reviews here at Amazon, then returned it soon after. Overall I would recommend to someone who needs an occasional cut now and then and not a pro that will be using daily. For one the laser had to be re-calibrated constantly as it would always be off a few degrees after just a few cuts- that is a PITA. Second, the instructions were not clear regarding bevel cut adjustments. Lastly, the cutting plane is both plastic and metal and I had to devise a jig to clamp down the pieces to be cut. You may draw your own conclusion from my experience. Good luck."
1,Mistake,"My first saw came damaged. The sub fence was broken and the bevel gauge was torn up. Amazon sent me a new one, and the second one was also not right. The sub fence on this one was not broken but did not line up with the back fence making a square cut impossibe. There was also grinding when I adjusted the bevel. Complete junk. Hitachi was no use. They informed me that it was manufactered in China. Big surprise. I do not see myself buying anymore Hitachi tools because the customer service was so poor. Maybe you will have better luck than me. My suggestion is to look the saw over very carefully before using it. I regeret this purchase."
1,two saws both defective,"I bought this saw from another vendor a year ago it was a floor model so I was able to check it out real good and it worked great for me.Then it got stolen.I liked it well enough to Buy it again and ordered it from Amazon. When it arrived I checked every thing out real well and found the laser to be out of alignment and the subfence was not lined up with the fixed fence .Rather than return it I called Hitachi .They told me the sub fence was bent and they would send me another one. After a week I received the wrong part. I called Hitachi again giving them the part number this time.0ne week later again ,wrong part again can't even figure out if this part even goes on this saw.So back to Amazon for an exchange ,new saw comes with new problem.Fence is broken (cracked off).Hitachi is garbage , no quality control."
4,great product - superb support,"Background: retired then downsized to a much smaller workshop, in the process I unloaded many power tools and had to think about space, versatility and probable applications.I decided on a compound, dual bevel 12 inch mitre, the C12FDH fit the bill and price.It arrived with a defective ""subfence B"". Within 1 business day I had contacted Hitachi customer support and after two emailed descriptions, they forwarded a new subfence B which was easily installed and fit to spec. Very good cooperative support personnel.The laser guide is a marvel for these old boomer eyes.I would recommend this product."
1,No support,"This saw arrived with part of its plastic case broken. Rather than return the whole saw, I tried to contact Hitachi through their support site on the web to get a replacement. Nothing but silence. I won't buy from them anymore."
5,"Great introduction, great literature, great price","Few authors (perhaps only Stephen King) have consistently tingled the spine like Master Poe. While two centuries have passed since his tortured life and twisted pen have graced our old world, his fame has endured, and this inimitable collection reminds us why. All the great stories are here: The Tell-Tale Heart, The Pit And the Pendulum, The Cask of Amantillado, The Purloined Letter, The Murders in the Rue Morgue, etc., etc., as well as all of his published poems and even some other of his writings thrown in for good measure. A must to add to the collection of any bibliophile."
3,Small but annoying problem with Castle Books version,"Edgar A. Poe was an amazing poet and story teller, and I would strongly urge anyone to purchase one of his complete tales and poems volumes. The Castle Books (2002) version is nicely bound and a great price. HOWEVER, the top of each right hand page reads ""Complete Tales and Poems"" rather than displaying the name of the story or poem on that page. While only a minor detail, I like to flip through volumes of this size, and this small problem drives me crazy! I don't know whether other versions (Doubleday, Barnes & Noble, etc.) have a similar issue, but if you have OCD like me, you might try one of those instead."
2,"Terrible Condition, not the edition shown","I got an old edition, not the Newest one shown in the picture. It was sticky and dirty. Had to sell it to a friend who didn't mind that."
2,Book was in great shape.,"The book was in great shape but, after many orders with Amazon that always arrived in just a few days,a week at most. This item took forever to get here. If I have to wait almost a month to get it it just kinda makes the whole deal a bummer. Not the companies fault just slow mail."
5,Just what I was looking for.,"I had a huge Poe Exam for my AP Literature & Composition class that covered 8 poems and 8 short stories. I was looking for a collection of all his works where I could highlight material, and quickly find any of his works. I did not want to waste too much money on something I was only going to use once, so I recommend buying this book for anyone who needs it as a quick reference or a short interval of time. If you are looking for a gift or a small treasure to pass down from generation to generation I recommend buying a hard cover book. The cover of this book fades quickly if you travel with it placing it on different locations."
5,Excellent for Poe lovers.,"This book is the best choice for people who spend hours reading about Mistery, and of course, if you like the way Edgar Allan Poe writes, it is your choice."
2,Small Print,"I bought this book but had to return it; I found the print so small I could not comfortably read it. Admittedly I am a senior and many people may not have a problem but be prepared, the print (or type) is uncommonly small. I would be better off buying a collection in two volumns. And no, I do not need large-type books."
4,Sometimes less is more,"When you think of Poe, you generally first think of his classic macabre short stories and poems, and then perhaps you also think of his detective fiction, often considered the forerunner of Sherlock Holmes and company.But after finishing this book, I discovered that those really made up a small amount of what he wrote. Mostly he seems to have written rather heavy handed satire. Maybe it was funny back then, but it's not especially funny now. Perhaps if there were annotations explaining just what he was satirizing, it would be better. But even so, most of it is just, so, er, thickly written, that it's hard to wade through.So basically, I think you're probably off just buying a book that isn't so complete. You really probably don't want to read most of this.That said, for $10, it's a pretty good deal. Lots of pages, seems sturdy of binding and paper. It's a little hard to read, I don't know if it's the text size, the type face they used, or if I need glasses."
1,not as pictured,"just annoyed....typically have no problems...but we liked the book that was pictured, and we did not receive that. The book we received was entirely black. too annoying to return it, considering it was not very expensive...just wanted people to know."
2,"Wouldn't fit, overpriced shipping","These labels arrived quickly. Most were too large to fit on our microwave buttons so I had to trim and even then they were too big. Of course if they made the font smaller then you couldn't read them very well, defeating their purpose. Also, there were no labels for some microwave functions, EXPRESS being the one missing for our microwave. What is outrageous is the shipping cost. These could easily fit in one standard first class envelope requiring only one first class stamp for postage. If you can't find free shipping offered, don't buy them."
5,Magnificent digital remaster of classic Beatles work,"After listening to Yellow Submarine, I was amazed at the clarity of tone that was brought to the listeners' ears. The current Beatles collections, although fantastic, can sound a bit muddy at times. This new release of Yellow Submarine literally sounds as if it were recorded in a high end digital studio of today. The surround sound panning that was incorporated by the new mixing team also made this an incredible listening experience. I'm a huge Beatles purist and I definitely don't view this project in a negative light. The new version allows fans to truly marvel how their recordings would have sounded if recorded with today's technology."
5,BEST SOUNDING BEATLES CD ON MARKET NOW!,"WOW. Like the film reissued at the same time, this new CD sounds awesome. The remixing and remastering give a fresh feel and sound and helps bring these songs into the 90's. ""Hey Bulldog"" is a great rocker, that should have been a single from this. Underrated Beatles songs like ""Baby Your A Rich Man"", ""Sgt. Pepper's"", and ""It's All Too Much"" get a new life, even though the extended film version of ""It's All Too Much"" is not here for some reason. Still all in all, a nice holiday gift for the casual Beatles fan as well as the video or DVD. A must have for music fans of all ages."
5,Awesone - as it was meant to be heard,"The clarity of this remix is phenominal. Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds is incredibly crisp, and new sounds can be heard in Hey Buldog! The addition of other songs from the movie was a great move."
2,Yellow Submarine?????,"It is funny that [no one] mentioned the whole orchestrated segment that has been left out!!! This simply is not the Yellow Submarine that the Beatles and George Martin intended for release. Yes, the sound is nice, and naturally the songs are Beatles so they are beautiful, but come on! Don't slap all kinds of material together and try to call it something else. It reminds me of the ""Love Songs"" and ""Rock and Roll Music"" lps from the mid seventies. Great music, repackaged and sold to us ONCE AGAIN."
1,It's NOT the Beatles!,"The sound...the feeling...the energy....It's JUST NOT THERE. The Beatles aren't just musicians. They're producers, too. You can't just listen to songs they played on and say, ""Yeah, that's a Beatle's Album."" I don't know if George Martin is dead, but he should dig a grave and roll around in it."
3,Some Good/Some Bad,"I can understand those purists that insist that the Beatles material not be tampered with in any way. It was art for the times, as conveyed brilliantly on four track equipment early, and then later eight tracks.I'm one for innovation, though, and most of the tracks do sound better here. The exceptions, ironically, are the songs from Pepper, ""Lucy,"" ""Little Help,"" and ""Sgt. Pepper."" For some reason, they just don't sound quite right.Several of the tracks, though, are much cleaner and are more vibrant. ""Nowhere Man"" really stands out, with a a biting bass sound that's buried on the original four track.I'd really like to see the old mono recordings remastered, like ""Please Please Me,"" and ""With The Beatles."""
1,Bad remix,"The new remix of the ""Yellow Submarine"" tracks is horrible. For example, on the original ""Yellow Submarine"" track, Ringo's vocal is isolated on the left speaker, and the instruments are isolated on the right. But on this new disc, the vocals are on both the left and the right, and most of the instruments are on both speakers, creating an almost mono track.The same goes with ""All You Need is Love."" The brass intro, ""Marseilles,"" (the French national anthem) is on the left and the piano chords under it are on the right. Once the song gets going, The Beatles' instrumentation is on the right and the orchestra instruments are on the left. But on this new album, it's really quite different. Once again, the new mix sounds mono.You're better off just to burn a copy of the original mixes of the songs, from various Beatles CDs you might have at home, than to buy this album. It's great music, but the remastering is less than good."
5,Great music made even better by the re mastering,Crisp clear music as we haven't heard in 30 years. Can we expect to hear more of this in the future with Beatles re releases? One can only hope.
2,Remix delivers mixed results,"Personally I'm not convinced by the new mixes. It's good to have a longer ""It's All Too Much"" but I'd have prefered the original mix and the same is true of all the other songs - the surround sound remixes are great for the cinema and/or video but on a stereo they mostly sound plain odd. Part of this is me being a purist - you CAN'T tamper with George Martin's productions for god's sake! But also, on many of the mixes it sounds like the guts have been ripped out of the songs (especially ""All You Need Is Love"" and ""Baby You're A Rich Man"") - the originals may be a little 'muddy' but sometimes all that compression adds a kind of fizz to the sound that painstaking hi-fi digital sound can't compete with. I think the songtrack's compilers should have issued 20 bit remasters of the original 60s mixes (there was a mix of the complete ""Too Much"" done at the time) because this CD just sounds, well, wrong. 5 stars for the music but just 2 for the CD itself."
2,Very few improvements,"Only three tracks had any improvements. On ""Yellow Submarine,"" the waves go back and forth from one speaker to the other. On the original, the waves are mono.On ""Baby You're a Rich Man,"" the harmony vocals, ""How does it feel to be..."" are louder than on the MMT disc. It's easier to hear them.""Hey Bulldog"" is louder and boomier, more ""alive"" sounding than on the first Yellow Submarine disc.Other than that, all the changes are horrible. So, it's hard to say whether you should buy it or not. Probably not."
3,"A Good, Albeit Unnecessary Compilation","On technical merit this CD merits some praise (unless you are a purist), but it really does little to add to the whole of the Beatles legend, and therefore rates only three stars.Here you have all the familiar songs from 1966-1967. If you already own Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour (and what Beatles fan doesn't), then this CD offers little more than some nuggets from the mediocre Yellow Submarine soundtrack album (itself redundant, aside from the George Martin musical score on side two, together with some expendable tunes from Paul, George and John).Should you buy this to experience old familiar Beatles songs in the latest state of the art presentation? Only if you believe that something is lacking in the prior mixes from the individual CD's. If not, I recommend adding to your collection from Past Masters 1 & 2. If you must experience Yellow Submarine in all its psychedelic glory, opt for the DVD or video instead."
5,SOUNDS INCREDIBLE,"YOU MAY BE SAYING TO YOURSELF ""WELL,I ALREADY HAVE THESE SONGS,DO I REALLY NEED THIS? YES,YOU DO BECAUSE YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD THEM LIKE THIS! THE SOUND IS INCREDIBLE! HOPEFULLY,EMI WILL DO THE WHOLE BEATLES CATALOG REMASTERED. AS FOR THE MATERIAL, YOU GET A LOT MORE VALUE HERE THEN ON THE ORIGINIAL-ROCK ON FOLKS"
5,"Greatest Beatles Hits, of course.....","But this is not the actual, original ""Yellow Submarine"" album with the weird cool atmospheric music from the film. For that you have to buy the old soundtrack. Nevertheless, the tracks on this remastered disc are some of the Beatles' greatest ever. A worthy investment if only for that reason."
4,We all live in a Yellow Submarine.....,"This album ties together some of The Beatles best songs from this period. For purists, I would still recommend the original Yellow Submarine recordings but the tracks contained here all stand out and remind us that this was truly a great band. I recommend listening to Rubber Soul and Revolver back-to-back in the same way that Sgt. Peppers and Magical Mystery Tour link together. An excellent collection of songs by this century's greatest songwriters. Highly recommended!"
5,the littlest fan of the beatles,"If you have ever seen the movie on vhs or dvd. Or even both then you better get this soundtrack. But dont take my word for it. There are two songs that i think are not in the movie. By this i love the beatles. My all time fave soug eleanor rigby, which is on the movie. Sadly the soundtrack is not in a good order. it should be in how it was in the movie. The nowhere man freaks me out terribly. There is a little secerct on the dvd too. I love the beatles forever and aways. I dont care what anybody says i wont give up on the music."
3,This is not the real Yellow Submarine Record!,"However swell the remastering job, this is not the Yellow Submarine album... it's completely missing George Martin's excellent instrumental work from the movie soundtrack, and as such it's revisionist history, done to pump up sales.Buy it if you like the songs that follow All You Need Is Love, (they're all great songs), but do so with the knowledge that you are not getting the Yellow Submarine album as the Beatles and George martin intended it to be. Only half of that album is here."
2,Avoid!,"It's all too easy to get blown away by this CD purely because it's The Beatles AND it's in state-of-the-art late 90s digital surround sound, BUT (a big but) this is tantamount to colouring in a Laurel and Hardy comedy. The remix initially sounds amazing and many punters will leave it at that and scream ""It ROCKS!!!"", but it's not what these records should sound like. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a meticulous high-quality REMASTERING, but REMIXING these tracks is ****ing heresy. They NEED what the original 1960s machinery, desks, effects etc... brought to the musical party. OK, '60s stereo panning was a joke, but these '90s mixes are OFFENSIVE. ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" sounds like it was recorded by having each Beatle overdub their parts one at a time, modern-style, the original sounded like a PAAARTY!!! Avoid! Avoid!"
3,What happened to the guitars?,"I loved the the way the vocals were boosted and the sound quality cleaned up,but what happened to the guitars?The guitars seemed to have been turned down and even smothered in some cases.I hope they get the first four Beatles albums remastered but hopefully George Martin and or Geoff Emerick are involved."
5,"Purely and simply, a revelation","A few purists may well shudder at the idea of re-mixing Beatles tracks, but this album deserved to be made and offers an incredible new insight into some of the Beatles best known songs. The enhanced mix is very effective but subtle. Listen to Eleanor Rigby and Paul's vocal is now focused in the centre rather than off to one side as in the original stereo mix. The string quartet backing is presented in stereo for the first time and has a wonderful three-dimensional quality. Listen to the track through headphones and you will feel like you are back in the Abbey Road studio in 1966. A superb and sypathetic technical achievement. I hope EMI, Apple and the remaining Beatles appreciate this and re-master the entire album collection."
4,The better of the two soundtracks!,"It's true. You get more music from the BAND iteself. Martin's orchestral work on the original is good, but underwhelming. The remixes and remasters (done in 1998 at Abbey Road) represented here are outstanding. A far better value. ""Rich Man"" , ""It's All Too Much"", and ""Nowhere Man"" are sonic standouts. The music sounds clearer, richer, and renewed. Look -if you're a purist to the point of balking at the music being remixed or remastered, consider this; George Martin did just that in 1987 for most of the band's catalogue to issue it on CD. If you must have the orchestral tracks, then go with the original soundtrack. Most listeners would be better served to buy this collection."
2,Earwax? Tone deafness? Not gullible enough?,"Well, it must be one of the above three reasons which prevents me from endorsing this album. I had heard these songs literally thousands of times before I put this new album in the CD player. Call me a heretic, but these versions are somehow WORSE than the originals. I can't put forward a sound engineer's analysis of why this is so; it just is. The other reason is that this ill-conceived and even-worse-sequenced ragbag contains some the Beatles' weakest material - or strong material ripped out of context. Hey, do me the same favour that I'm going to do myself - when the inevitable deluge of remastered Beatles albums hits the shelves over the next few years in order to swell George and Ringo's dissipated fortunes - stick with your originals (preferably on vinyl.)"
2,Good but Pathetic at the Same Time,"Without much doubt this is the crappiest of all the Beatles Albums(which all earned between 3 and 5 stars) basically because as you can see there is absolutely nothing new or original about it, it is like a greatest hits record rather then a full fledged album. Not one original song...kind of pathetic for the greatest band of all time isnt it? The songs are all good though...just nothing new. If I am not mistakin this is the only Beatles album to never take No 1 on Billboard...and deservingly so"
1,Bad Mixes -- Don't Bother,"The idea for this ""songtrack"" was good (though it excludes ""A Day In The Life"" which was used when the yellow submarine left Liverpool). But these mixes are awful on standard audio equipment. All the power and majesty of ""It's All Too Much"" has been obliterated. You're better off with the original recordings. Let's hope they fix the horror of the soundtrack that's on the DVD, and let's hope the new digital remixes of the entire Beatles' catalog sound more like the ""Love"" album than this tripe."
3,FOR A BEATLES FANATIC LIKE ME THIS BEATLES ALBUM IS OK,"I'm glad they made another beatles album the songs are pretty good and some some songs are are weird and make you waste money on this album. This album is ok some song's are great but some some are not and you'll think that there are not alot of songs. This album is quite good.but if your a beatles fanatic like me, you should probably buy this album."
5,pleasantly surprised,"i've never paid much attention or respect to the beatles. a few of their songs impressed me, such as the random few times i heard ""yellow submarine"". i bought this album for that song and discovered to my astonishment some very creative and wonderful songs. ""hey bulldog"" ""baby you're a rich man"" both rock, ""with a little help..."" ""eleanor rigby"" ""love you to"" are contagious. overall this is great stuff and should be purchased by any open minded listener of music"
4,AN ALTERNATIVE LISTEN,"why are people freaking out about this cd? the original 1969 version is still there. no one's out to monkey up the beatles catalog. if you don't like it don't buy it.if you did try giving it to someone who might like it. think of it as a nice demonstration of the fidelity of the original mutitrack tapes, given a fresh digital remix to enjoy.for example: on ""lucy in the sky"" where ringo brings in the chorus, his drums have great depth never heard before on the track. it's still the beatles but in ""hi fi"". don't worry,it won't hurt the original cd's that were mastered with almost 20 year old technology.it's nothing to get hung about."
2,Blasphemy,"Does any real Beatle fan actually that the Beatles music needs a facelift in any way? This is simply ridiculous. I enjoyed the Anthologies...getting to hear how four geniuses worked together in the studio. But what is this I read about ""new"" sounds and being blown away by the sound? The way the music sounds on the original recordings is how it was supposed to be heard, and anything different has simply been tampered with. I give it a two because the music on the CD is greatest rock and roll ever recorded, but this is one Beatles album I will never add to my collection. I am perfectly happy with my copy of Yellow Submarine, ""bad"" sound quality and all. Sounds pretty damn good to me."
4,Aural experience!,"""Eleanor Rigby"" re-mix with the stringed instruments in 'full' stereo as opposed to the left channel only, PLUS center vocals opposed to right channel - this alone is worth the 'admission' as they say.""Hey Bulldog"" with a similar re-mix is just the added 'gift'.Those of us that prefer the 'soundtrack' of 1969 should just buy it and add it to some of these wonderful remixes - if you wish.BUT - there really is no room for anything negative mentioned about the fine work that was done to these tracks - just beautiful!"
3,It was okay.,"I guess I'm just used to listening to the older versions. They sounded so much different. They sounded (and I mean this in a good way) hollow. It made them sound really good. But now they sound totally down to earth and flat. The songs themselves are great, so I suggest buying them on different albums."
1,I cannot hear any difference from the original version,"Don't get fooled by the statement that these songs are all ""digitally remixed"". There is no remixed version, no new arrangement, virtually just the same as the original ones. Maybe these ""remixed"" songs have better sound effect. But sorry, I cannot tell the difference. I doubt if anybody in this world can. If the advertisement tells the truth that these songs are just remastered versions, then I will never buy this. I should have heard the sound samples from this site before buying this. Then I can save some money."
3,When did they change it?,"I was actually looking for what is apparently an old version of the album. I didn't notice anything about this in the Amazon description but when the album arrived, on that sticker that holds the case close it says ""(New Version)"". Apparently we'd been checking the old version out of the library for the kids. The new version lacks the instrumental sections of the old version, which is the part we like. I'm quite disappointed."
1,"Rubbish, laddie... pure rubbish","Hey, I got a great idea... let's re-mix the Beatles! I mean, George Martin, Norman Smith, Geoff Emerick... who were these guys, anyway? I can do a much better job... besides, when you apply the latest technology to things, it ALWAYS improves them."
5,Correction to my other review,"I wrote another review on this item. two things i want to correct 1:I said the rock and song ""Hey Bull Dog"". I meant to say Rock Song or Rock and roll song. 2: I said some of the songs were written for the movie and were not on any earlier albums or something like that. I meant to say that i think that some.....Etc.Just a correction."
4,Better value than last time,"The original Yellow Submarine Soundtrack had just 4 Beatles songs not previously released. Here they are again, with 11 others, all of which are on other Beatles CD's. However, the re-mixed and re-mastered quality is as good as the brand new Yellow Submarine video release, so this CD release is worth the money. Why the George Martin orchestral soundtrack has been removed is unclear, because there is plenty of capacity on the CD. ""It's All Too Much"" has been restored to its 6 minute length, but if you are looking for other new version or new songs, you'll be disappointed."
4,Great little device...,"No flash, but SO tiny... smaller than eyeshadow, fits easily into my purse with the Jordana (in an Incipio case, also highly recommended). Perfect for taking pics when I've forgotten my ""real"" digital camera (Canon S100). Don't leave home without it (and the HP car charger, and spare external battery, and extra compact flsh cards, etc...)!"
5,Scotland's dialects,"This is a great book for Scots, their descendants, or anyone who has visited Scotland and wondered why there are so many different ""languages"". As always, Billy Kay does an incredible job, comparing and contrasting the dialects by geographical regions. He does not omit the finer differences within these regions, e.g. within a 50 mile radius of Glasgow there are numerous variations, each having quite different words for the same subject. He tells of people who feel that speaking Scots is wrong, many believe it is slang. Depending on the geographical area, the dialect can be musical and a delight to the ear, others may sound coarse and grating. This is a book that should be passed around to spread the word."
1,Flog the Engineers,"The sound quality of this CD is atrocious! It sounds as though the engineers used a single microphone plopped in the middle of the orchestra and placed Mr. Harle in the lobby. I cannot even comment on the skills of Mr. Harle as I could barely hear him.Very disappointing. I recommend that you do not buy this CD.I also purchased ""Music for Saxophone and Orchestra"" and found the sound quality to be far superior and the music very enjoyable."
1,The H in Harle stands for HORRIBLE,"Poor sound quality, lousy musical interpretation, and other problems make this album a horrible set of saxophone concertos. Harle almost never uses vibrato, plays outlandish cadenzas, and even skips entire phrases he doesn't want to play on some occasions. The expressiveness in his playing is almost non-existant, not to mention some technical problems, too. For example, at the end of the Glazounov concerto, instead of playing low C - middle C - altissimo C quarter notes, Harle starts on a low C and plays a *very* sloppy, uneven scale ascension to the altissimo C. His playing is generally pisspoor and his overall performance subpar. Try listening to interpretations by Eugene Rousseau, Dale Underwood, Donald Sinta, or other saxophonists. Just stay away from John Harle. FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS GOOD IN THIS WORLD, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING BY JOHN HARLE!"
2,Muddy Sound,"Not a well recorded album. Murky sound throughout and a lack of sonic clarity. The sax and ensemble fight each other to emerge from te mix. Bad job of balancing by the engineer! The playing is OK, but not great. There are better saxophone with orchestra CDs out there."
2,If you could only have 1 sax recording--this would NOT be it,"I have to give credit to the Orchestra of the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields. This is a fine presentation of some pieces that are often more demanding on the orchestra than the saxophonist. However, there are some key reasons why I would not recommend this recording to anyone. #1 Balance--the saxophone is quite often drowned out or difficult to hear over the orchestra. #2 When you can hear the saxophone, the excessively live acoustics mask what is a rather brittle and weak tone. #3 Musical cuts, particularly in the Glazounov aren't neccessary or effective. #4 Though John Harle is a skilled saxophonist, this recording comes nowhere near the caliber--both musically and technically--that is demanded of modern concert saxophonists. If you must have a saxophone recording to add to your collection, I would look elsewhere."
4,Very Fine once again tape from Red Green 'Stuffed and Mounted' number one 4-vhs compilation,"Red Green is proprietor of 'PossumLodge', 24 beer stores north ofToronto, which of course is theCentre of the universe, as somesay! Great 16 year canadian TVshow that is shown on some publicTV stations."
2,Ours wouldn't fly in New Mexico,"We live in NM - very high altitude. The plane seemed to be operating properly...yet, it could not get very high off the ground. (It was 55 degrees and almost no wind.) Our longest flight, was no more than 10 seconds. We had to return the plane to the store where we purchased it.It is probably a great toy for those who don't live up so high though..."
2,BAD!,Ok so i got this for christmas and right out of the box it looked faulty. ALL STYRAFOME....now when i went to fly it..it didnt..it just went up and fell..though i got 1 good flight...i wouldn't buy this toy again. But u gotta luv my parents for the thought.
2,A kid's review,"I got this toy for my birthday and I was really trilled. It looked like an awesome toy, but when I took it out to play, the only thing that worked was the thrust button. All it did was keep on going left. My friends and I got bored and annoyed pretty quickly with it. Don't waste your money on this."
1,WORST WASTE OF FIFTY DOLLARS,"I got 50 $ for my birthday and I really wanted a R/C plane, so I bought this thing. Big mistake. First time I tried it was too windy, and part of the tail wing broke off. Second time, there was almost 0 breeze and it took off, but then did half a U turn crashing into the ground. Now I have a ""plane"" if thats what you'd like to call it sitting next to me with part of it's tail wing off and white spots all over from chipped paint. DO NOT BUY THIS THING"
3,begginers only,if you want to be an expert in flying this is what you should start with.Once you have masterd the way this plane fly's and you have got a smooth landing you are ready for a better plane.Go to your nearest HobbyTown and look at some ameture planes.Hobbyzone planes are what you should go with.GOOD LUCK!
4,Good Plane,"I bought this plane thinking it wouldn't work. I was wrong. I crashed the thing so many times it isn't funny. And it didn't snap in two or lose a wing. A little bit of the coloring came off but that's to be expected if it slammed the pavement from 25 ft. up. It doesn't work too well in the wind, but it works great if you h ave a field to fly in. KEEP IT AWAY FROM TREES! I flew mine into a holly tree twice and it isn't much fun getting it out of there, so keep away from trees and houses. Very Good Toy - Very Durable - Lots of fun!"
5,"Uh oh , spaghetti o's!","This plane was great and fun to fly at first but then about three days later the internal rechargeable battey died. I went to [a local store] to see if I could get a replacment battery. They also sold the Resistor there but not any replacement batteries for it. They say that spinmaster hasn't heard about any of the batteries going bad and that spinmaster hasen't released a replacement. The told us to go to [another local store] and get a custom made battery. My friend has had his for a few months and he loves it. He said that his battery hasn't died yet. I also noticed that this plane is vey well designed. Oh well, maybe I just got a bad one."
4,must have,"this is my third year buying an airhog plane. I went from the small hand held chargeres to this plain. downside - not for young children, my son is 5 and loves the plane but he can not fly it, he loves to watch and chase it. you can not fly this or any other air hog in a strong wind. I recently had one fly away and lost it in the wind. only fly it in the summer with a light breeze but once you get the hang of it, it is alot of fun. they say fly it in a open field, good suggestion but I dont, I fly it in my front yard and between the houses and been doing ok. this is my second resistor, the first finally broke at the end of the summer but got the whole season out of it before it finally broke. I estimate I flew it about 200 times before the wing broke. once you tape it it never flies the same."
5,Best toy for baby early on and still fun later,"My daughter loved these chimes when she was just a young baby - the chime sounds are pleasing and not ""tinny"" - she would gaze at them when she was really small (I had them hanging over her playmat), and they were the first things she reached for when she starting learning how to grab. Even at nine months, my daughter still loves to play with them, shaking them with great glee! I highly recommend these chimes - well worth the money."
4,Company Did Nicely,This a good product and the company supplying it did a superb job of getting it to me in a timely fashion. I recommend the company highly.
5,"An Absorbing, Important Book","Waite strips Adolf Hitler down to the core, revealing in his childhood explanations for not only why Hitler was who he was, but also revealing in general the reasons the German volk followed him down the fiery path of the Holocaust. His fascinating analysis of the routine and horrifying abuse that passed for normal child-rearing methods in middle European countries tears away the the curtain that has shrouded the motivations of Hitler and his countrymen, and makes it clear that the Holocaust was not an abberation in Germany--it was an inevitability. Read this with Alice Miller's ""For Your Own Good"" and Wolff's ""Child Abuse in Freud's Vienna,"" and you'll get the picture."
4,The personal character of Adolf Hitler,"Dr. Waite has revealed many important aspects of thepersonal character of Adolf Hitler. A very good read forany person who is interested in why this evil man was theway he was, and the motivations behind his nature."
1,Professor R.G.L. Waite should learn to stick to history.,"It is not my intention to denigrate the talents of the historian Dr. Waite, but he should have learned a long time ago to leave Psychoanalysis to the Freudians. His book on Adolf Hitler is an attempt to capitalize on the general odium that is the fate of Hitler in the modern world. Mr Waite would have done better to present his subject in the light of new material recently made available by interviews of victims and loyalists to Hitler. Instead the author chose to cast Hitler in the most amateurish fashion imaginable. Fiction , facts and fabulations are all thrown into this pot of Ragout, and all seasoned most profusely with Freudian lingo. Mr. Waite, please don't do us another favour and honour us with more of your talent. Briefly said, you had your chance and blew it, your credibility with serious historians is shot."
4,A Compelling True Story All Parents Should Read!,Today I Smile is a compelling true story by a mother who had to learn to live again after the death of her daughter. A very moving story all parents should read!
5,Well-written and Eye-opening,"This book is not just for parents who have lost children to addiction or death; it an honest warning to parents of teens, to teachers, to everyone that drug users do not always fit the part of what most people consider a ""druggie"". It's eye-opening.Diane writes candidly about her fears, struggles, mistakes, and victories as a parent. One of the most profound aspects of the book is when Diane confesses she couldn't identify with her daughter's drug addiction until after Mandy's death--when she was awakened to her own addiction: an addiction to her daughter's presence. One of the most well-written and insightful books I've read in a long time."
5,Insightful Book,"My greatest fear is losing my son or daughter, and this book was not only heartwrenching, but insightful as well, delving into young people and the continual problem with drugs and addiction. Excellent book, especially for parents or teachers of our young ones."
5,Beautiful,That Gary Marks is not recognized as a national institution is a shame.His songs are so profound and beautiful.I would love to see him in concert.
5,One hundred and eight locations that have helped shape the spiritual foundation of humanity,"Now in an updated second edition, Sacred Places Around the World: 108 Destinations is a wondrous compilation of one hundred and eight locations that have helped shape the spiritual foundation of humanity. From the Great Pyramid and the Sphinx, to the Silk Road in China, the Himalayas in Bhutan, Temples of Angkor in Cambodia, Easter Island in Chile, Chaco Canyon in New Mexico, Knossos in Greece and much more, each location features a brief yet vivid description and history, as well as recommendations for getting there. Black-and-white and a handful of color illustrations embellish this emotionally moving guide, ideal for spiritual seekers choosing a pilgrimage and armchair travelers alike."
3,"Something was ""off""","The author has all the talent a reader could want - she can create a good plot - but these characters! I thought the vulgarity & cruelty of the husband ""Ben"" was written in a very heavy-handed way, and the heroine, Sara, was a little too goody-goody for my taste (the way she let herself be taken advantage of by that Tasha character, geez! Too much a doormat.)The romance kind of got taken over by melodrama at the end. After a strong start, I lost interest about 1/2 through the book; ironically, right around the time that the hero & heroine confessed their love for each other. A reader shouldn't experience that loss of interest just at the most interesting point in any romance novel, yet that's what happened to me. I just couldn't care about these characters.Not a keeper by any means, but 3 stars for a strong first half, and for the fact that the character of the heroine's little son was written in a realistic way (he's not cutesy; not overly talkative beyond his age)."
2,Not Quite.,"This story is markedly different--thinner plot, les complex characters-than other of Gaffney's novels. It made me wonder if someone else wrote it, or if it was dashed off to meet a publication deadline. Its major weakness was the uni-dimensionality of the two major characters. They did not engage the reader as, for example, Carrie Wiggins and Tyler Wilkes did in Sweet Everlasting. Those two were fully developed characters who exhibited contentment,weaknessness,doubt,arrogance,satisfaction, fearfulness,joy, inner as well as outer strength,and struggles within their social contexts. This is Gaffney's strength as a writer-wonderfully engaging plot populated by complex and sympathetic characters who stay with you long after you finish the novel. Another Eden was a disappointment."
3,Hospital Nurse,Only about 2/3 of the book is actually her story and that is due to her death. There were a lot of interesting facts but ite was just too short. I admire the devotion of all the civil war nurses who put their devotion to cause above all else. About 1/3 of the booki is an introduction to the generalities of what was expected and acceptable behavior for women living in that time period.
5,Work great,"I was happy to finally find some narrow clamps for building railroad models. These clamps hold tight but arent so strong they leave marks in the soft wood. The narrow helps hold in the middle of the buildings, other small clamps I have do not reach far enough, GREAT for crafts."
3,Mad Scientist with good intentions,"Think 20,000 Leagues of the sky. This movie is definitely a knockoff of the far better Disney movie 20,000 leagues under the sea. Same twisted captain character, played by Vincent Price, who has a grudge against humanity. In his case though he has a technological edge and craft that frees him from participation in human society. He can't help meddling in human affairs, however, which is ultimately his downfall. Check out Charles Bronson as the hero.Michael J. FoyAuthor of The Kennedy Effect"
2,Richard Harrison?,"Just watched the movie on TCM. I watched it because I am a fan of Vincent Price, but the actor who kept me interested was the man at the ship's wheel. Is that Richard Harrison? His strong and muscular physique was one of the most exciting pieces of scenery in the movie. Once in awhile I saw his handsome profile. He was one hunk of a man in his day...."
1,"Its no ""20,000 Leagues Under The Sea........................","This movie is awful. The only good thing about it is Vincent Price, but even with his masterful presence the movie sinks well before the actual airship does. Jules Verne must have run out of ideas by the time he wrote this, simply because it borrows heavily from 20,000 Leagues (minus the good stuff, I might add). Charles Bronson is at his worst here delivering such an emotionless performance. How he ever became a star with this on his record is beyond me. How did these people keep a straight face while filming this waste of talent? The special effects hurt the film very badly, to. The airship is such a ridiculous looking machine that you can never get past gawking at it so that you can even try to take the film seriously! Avoid this movie at all costs, or suffer the fate of the Albatross crew you will!!!!!!!!!!!Honestly, this film gets no stars at all."
3,MASTER OF THE WORLD - FUN SUNDAY AFTERNOON FLICK,"I had seen this movie many years ago when it aired on TCM and was already prepared not to expect to much, having seen it when it first aired in 1961. While it is definitely a B movie, the performances by Vincent Price and Charles Bronson make the movie viewable and is definitely one to add to the Sunday afternoon 'list' of movies to enjoy, even if you drift off for a nap. It is essentially an 'in the air' version of ""20,000 leagues under the sea"". The picture quality is Excellent! Unfortunately it is a MOD (Made On Demand) format, not a pressed disc.Still enjoyable, despite it being a little slow on direction.Closed Captioning is not included for the hearing impaired."
4,Master of the World DVD Review,"I recently purchased this DVD-R from Amazon and thought I would write a short review. The movie is based on, I think, two Jules Verne novels ""Master of the World"" and ""Robur the Conqueror"". I remember seeing this film as a kid and purchasing the paperback book with an image from the film on the cover. The film itself is very entertaining.My only gripe is that it is on a DVD-R and not a DVD. It has a rather simple menu and the chapter stops are about every 5-10 minutes or so. Since it is from MGM the video quality is excellent and probably better than the widescreen laserdisc which I do have. I have not done a direct comparison but it looks excellent and is anamorphic.Since MGM may never release this film on a regular DVD this might be your best option to get it unless you opt for the two releases from Spain. But if you are happy with a DVD-R then don't hesitate as the video is excellent."
4,Master of the World,Terrific movie with another fine performance from Vincent Price. Also an early appearance of Charles Bronson is an added treat.
4,AH-64A model review,"1) I do not know where the customer saw his real Apache at, but he seems to be incorrect on several points. I work on AH-64A and D models here at Hunter Army Airfield, Savannah, GA.A) The main rotor blades are in the correct location in the picture and also are the tail rotor blades. You have a set of inboard and a set of outboard tail blades.B) The blades are a different color from the airframe,they are black.C) As for the Main Landing Gear, they appear to be in the correct scale and location.D) As for the weathering effect, well he needs to see our birds that have just came back from the Desert. They look like the one in your picture.E) The angle of the Gunners/Co-Pilot and Pilot's stations dose look correct.Well this all that I have to say. We are looking at a toy not a true to scale model and it sure dose look real close to scale and worth the price. Thank you for your time."
1,haughty and unrealistic assessments,These reviews of the hard work of writers such as myself are superficial and even sloppy.
5,Best filter replacement,"So far so good. Runs just like the stock filter, but lasts forever and is actually effective. I got an old Suzuki GS1000 dirt cheap and when I pulled it apart to see why it wouldn't run, I found a mostly destroyed old foam filter in the airbox. This replacement saves me from rejetting my carbs (I was going to go pod filters and decided not to) so hooray for that! You won't be disappointed. Great price too."
3,Pretty good starter mike,"I used this mike for a really long while, to practice vocals at home for a spoken word and music project I was doing for a couple years. It's a Shure so it's good! But when you upgrade eventually to, say, the legendary SM58 or any of the Beta models, you will notice a SIGNIFICANT boost in power... Consider these other options if you're looking to record or perform for a live audience. Still, the PG58 is definitely great as an intro mike. And probably the best for the price!"
5,Great Mic For the Price,I have another SHURE mic that I paid more for ( the 48 model)...this one is much more sensitive and works great! Highly recommended!
4,Good value,"Seems to have good sound reproduction. Microphone has solid construction. And it's a good price, definitely a good buy. Be sure to get a pop screen."
4,shure pg58,im pretty sure its good... i just have it today oct.23 2008 i place the order last oct.18 2008... the only thing i dont like is the cable it should be xlr to xlr but when i open it its a xlr to 1/4 but its ok... i got the pg48 back in 2002 and its still working pretty good now that i have the pg58 i think the mic is better than what i got
5,Shure Microphone - high quality!,I ordered three of these microphones after doing some research and found that they are as advertised: high quality and easy to work with. They really do the job!
2,Fine for mounted use but not for handheld use,"I bought this mic for use doing interviews. The reviews I read said it had great mic isolation and had very little handling noise. This is NOT true. Just holding the mic as stationary as you possibly can you will hear handling noise. If you mount it to a mic stand and anything touches it, you will hear that noise in your recording. I spoke with an engineer at Shure and he said that this is not the mic for handheld use. It's an entry level mic that is very limited in how it can be effectively used without tons of handling noise."
4,"Durable, Quality Build, Good Sound","We've been gigging with this for about a year now. The quality of the build is high, as its been dropped more than a few times. The sound quality hasn't changed through all of those falls, and it still looks like it did on day one. The only drawback is that I know there are higher quality microphones for sound reproduction in both live and recording (we've used this for recording) situations. For live gigs at local bars... it's great... and people are probably too inebriated to care anyways! :D"
5,Nice microphone. Good for rugged use.,Happy with this microphone. Good quality and worth for the money. I have been using it since a month. No issues so far.
3,A Different Kind of Cinderella Story,"I give this book 3 stars mostly for being fairytalish. But it was definatly interesting enough to keep my attention. I can't say this book is particularly believable, but the characters were intriguing and seemed real enough. Though some might disagree with me, Mousie was not without her problems. She's a social outcast in school and after her father died, before she got Dancer, Mousie had fallen into a deep depression.I can't say I like the romance between Mousie and Sandy, and the stuff with Arabella was pretty stupid, but whatever. Overall the book was pretty good. In the right writer`s hands, these kinds of books about superstar horses are good, and Dancer is one of them. You have to know if you decide to read this book that it is basically a Cinderella story, and you have to be okay with that, otherwise you`re just going to hate it."
3,"A good plot, a little to fast-paced.","I thought this book had a good theme, but in some parts it was unrealistic and too fast-paced. For example, I think the situation would be rather uncomfortable if Mousie was to continue dating her step-brother. I think the author should have been more descriptive in certain scenes, and taken more time to elaborate on them. Ie: the Royal Winter Fair, Mousie's first presentation for the queen. The last half of the book was much better then the first, I was dissappointed when I started reading. Over all, it was a fairly good book, with a happy ending, but I suggest you borrow it from the library rather then buy it."
5,Great Book!!,"I have found that a few people disagree with me on how they rate the book. I do see what they are saying that the book is too fairy tale, but from my perspective I read books to get away and make me happy. Shelley Peterson is an amazing writer and I enjoyed the way she wrote the book equally as much as what she wrote about. DANCER is the best teenage horse book I have ever read. I am a teenager and I have and love horses and am never able to find books for my age they are always in age groups that are too old or too young. I dont feel that I have to explain what the book is about their are enough reviews..."
1,BORING,"this book was dull from beginning to end! i couldnt believe shelly wrote a book of such unrealality!!! it was sooo stupid the way this 'mousie' character accomplished everything she wanted to. i know that the author wrote about what every girl dreams of, but having mousie do ALL of them made this story extreamly FAKE!!! this book is NOT worth buying but perhaps ok to check out at a library if u r really that desprate."
5,Awsome Book for horse lovers!,"Dancer is one of my favorite books.....Its also one of the best book buys I've gotten because I've read it so many times! I would recomend this to any one, whose ever dreamed of making it big in the horse world.....Its especailly great since it takes place in Canada!"
5,Dancer ROX,"dancer is the best book ever writen!!!! 'nuf said, but if you want to hare what it is about then I will tell you. It is bout a girl and her horse and how they over come all odds to come out on top. They face a neighbor trying to steal the horse, money probs and one high school prep but mousie and dancer beat all odds. Once again, Best book EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Every girl will love this book.,"This book is wonderful. I have read it eight times and my mother wants me to read a different book, but I just want to keep reading this one over and over again. I think that every girl my age (11 and a half) would love this book. Even my big sister loves it, but she's only read it three times. I love the horses and the story and the people in the book. I wish I could meet Mousie, and talk to her about horses and the Queen."
1,Not nearly as good as I had expected,"All the reviews that I read for this book were really good, but I was very disappointed after I read the book. I mean, it is so unrealistic! I know the parts about Arabella and her father are not supposed to be, but seriously, what horse picks someone up with their head and lifts them onto their back? And the author is supposed to know about horses! And Dancer never, ever loses. And nothing bad ever happens to him. And Mousie is not bad at anything! A good character has to do something wrong. They should classify this book as fantasy, because the things that happen in this book sure never happen in real life. I should give it no stars at all, but I like the author's writing style. and it has a FEW good parts."
3,good book for newbies,"I enjoyed reading this book, and would highly recommend it for first time guitar builders. The best part of the book, is the author/s attempt to keep it simple .From tools, to wood ,to simple jigs, spare room workshop, and using inexpensive woods to build one/s first guitar. I would not recommend this book for advanced builders, as it falls short in many areas for advanced guitarmaking"
4,Habitat for Humanity: How to Build a House,"This soft-covered manual provides a remarkably concise overview of the elements of home building from A to Z. I have been a weekly construction volunteer with Habitat for 5 1/2 years, so this book is particularly appropriate and useful. Don't expect any coverage of plumbing or electrical work, but the remaining trades are very well done. Foundations, floor systems, walls and roofs are all covered, explained well, and accompanied by good pictures. For non-Habitat purposes, there are ample applications that can benefit from this book. These would include shed construction, decks, door and sindow installations, etc. There are many other books that deal directly with projects such as decks, but this text is definitely helpful as an overview of home construction."
1,Watch Out! He doesn't know what he's doing.,"Jack Grunsky does not know how to sing. He sings ""The More We Get Together"" the wrong way. He should sing it with a little less screaming and a little more percussion. At least Raffi knows how to do it correctly! I will never let anyone listen to this stinky album!"
2,The Letters to the Seven Churches of Asia,The book was very complicated. It gave way too much information that really just seemed to fill page after page. Was so hard to follow. I found myself skimming over pages and picking out only information that seemed understandable. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they had gone to seminary or were quite apt in history. Finally put the book away that cost a pretty penny after much frustration.
4,Dick Francis for sailors,"Sam Llewellyn's adult books are similar to Dick Francis' horse racing books with sailing as the setting. If you know a little about sailing and enjoy this type of fiction, you will enjoy these books. They are not as ""fast"" a read as Francis, but enjoyable."
5,Love It!,"I have a copy that I have stapled together and am going to order new for all my grandkids. I really enjoy this version, the illustrations are fantastic!"
3,Too small,"The description didn't say anything about the book being really small. I was surprised by the size, I thought it would be a regular size Golden Book and it wasn't. Other than the name written in it, it is in great shape."
5,"A Super ""First Little Golden Book""","This is a First Little Golden Book, not the larger Little Golden Book. See the Description given for it."
5,Excellent basic and/or beginners workout!,"I LOVE Joyce Vedral and have done her workouts (on and off) for about nine years and therefore own most of her DVDs already. But I have to say that this has to be one of my favorite JV DVDs. It is a no non-sense, basic, well paced workout. Some of her other workout DVDs are paced too fast and can be hard to keep up with, but not this one. It's brilliant and easy to follow. If you are just starting out or simply want a simple weights routine to do at home, I highly recommend this one. You will also need the book if you are starting out for all the extra info you don't get on the DVD.Be aware that anyone looking for an advanced workout will not be happy with this one. It's basic but it WORKS!"
1,Bitter Aftertaste,"Any jelly I made with this agar agar was unpalatable, because it had an awful after-taste. The agar-agar smelled like medicine even while being dossolved in liquid.Not sure if I got a bad batch, but I wouldn't buy from this seller again."
1,Slow Shipping,"Their shipping is expensive and they havent even shipped it yet. Had I known that it would take more than 16 days (and counting) for this company just to get the product out the door, I would have purchased from one of the many other sellers on amazon."
4,Scarecrow,I bought this for my 10yr old and it was cute. The headpiece was the only thing I had an issue with. It was not sewn properly and the hat was made for an infant! I had also bought the Tin-man costume and had the same problem. I ended up calling the manufacturer and they sent us a new hat that fit correctly but not the light brown headpiece so we just cut it to make it work for the night. It did look really cute in the end.
1,Terrible quality and missing pieces,"The costume is terrible quality and it doesn't come with a mask as pictured. It was also missing all the straw and one of the black straps. Not sure what happened with this transaction, but it was a big fail on Amazon's part. I returned the costume."
3,Cute but some accessories (hat/scarf) were too small,"I ordered size M for my son who wears a size 8. The costume itself fit perfectly, but the hat and orange neck scarf were too small. He couldn't even wear the hat because it didn't fit his head at all, so we went with a straw cowboy hat instead. I attached a picture so you can see how the orange head/neck accessory fit. Overall, he looked cute but I had to improvise to make it happen. I wish the accessories came in the correct size (they probably have the same accessories for all sizes)."
3,It's ok for the value!,"Size is as described for the body. But the head is way to small to fit for a 4-6yr old, found this though with every costume thus had to adjust. Need to put more straw."
1,The beginning of the end for Spenser...,"Bad, bad, bad. Spenser goes pretentious and boring. After an interesting beginning, things (and the length of the book) spin out of control, as Spenser finds Susan again and makes up. Ever since, they've been gag-reflex inducing lovebirds... Still, the worst part of this book is the finale. Spenser becomes Bond, invades an underground base (all the while soul-searching himself endlessly), wraps things up before you know it and very unspectacularly, and goes out again. Pointless and ridiculous - and totally at odds with the attempts at greater profundity. Things were never the same after this... unfortunately."
3,A Catskill Screenplay?,"I'm in the process of reading all of the Spenser novels, and so far this is the most unusual. Unlike other Parker novels, which feature somewhat realistic settings and situations, Catskill is wildly unbelievable -- more like a Bond movie than anything else. Spenser and Hawk actually start a small war in weapons installation!A welcome change in this book is the fairly limited appearance of the hateful Susan Silverman; whose actions in this book make you wonder why Spenser doesn't end their relationship -permenantly.Generally speaking, Parker's greatest weakness as an author is his writing of women. Both Rachael Wallace and Silverman's dialogue is more like Mr. Spock than any female I've ever met. Fortunately we are spared the inevitable three page chapters in which Susan expounds on Spenser's motivations or some other character's. But Parker knows this isn't his strength, because I've been skipping those chapters lately, and it doesn't hurt the story at all!"
2,not as described,"book was labeled ""good"" condition. what arrived was an ancient book with cut and torn front and back covers and yellowed pages. when the book was opened the front cover and the first several pages fell apart (as will the rest of the book if I continue to read it). the company name listed on the website was ""good is green"" but the book label on the back said ""giggil"". I WILL NOT DO BUSINESS WITH EITHER COMPANY AGAIN!!!!"
4,Not among the best but still very good.,"I have read several Spenser novels chronologically starting with Mortal Stakes. This was my least favorite so far, but I still give it high grades. Parker is really stretching credibility in a story that boils down to a fight between two boys over a girl. It is a really big and complicated fight, and it involves mercenaries, gun manufacturers, CIA, FBI, so on and so on. But Parker somehow pulled it off. I can't help but enjoy the dynamic of Spenser, Hawk, Susan, et al. As with all of Parker's books, the strength lies in his characters.Overall, it was an entertaining but not quite great book; it was just a little too farfetched to get a five star rating. But if you are a fan of Spenser, you have to read this book. It is of crucial importance if you are following the relationships and the development of the characters."
2,Deus Ex Machina,"Okay, so Spencer goes and busts Hawk out of jail. Along the way, these two commit a few dozen felonies and should, by all rights, be put away for life. Then, magically, along comes the FBI and CIA to wipe out all the charges. Huh? It was as if Parker read over what he had written, knew that there was no way out of the corner he had painted Spencer into, and had to come up with a pretty lame escape. I am sorry, but this is not one of his better efforts.In fiction, in order to make the fiction work, one needs a suspension of disbelief. Under the right circumstances, we can believe in Godzilla and Harry Potter, knowing that these things do not exist. In what is supposed to be realistic fiction, it is best not to stretch belief too far, as was done here.A lot of the story is interesting enough, but the suspension of disbelief here does not work."
2,The worst Parker novel so far,"I don't understand how anyone could give this story a good review. Too much stuffing and not enough meat. This relationship with Susan is just ridiculous and has really soured my outlook on reading further in the series. Spenser has turned into a sappy, reflective, whimp who needs to be slapped."
4,A Catskill Eagle (Spenser,"Robert B. Parker is one of my favorite authors and Spensor is a smart, quick, no none sense Hero. Have read just about all of the Spenser's.Has a good helper with Hawk and a Good woman Susan. Just Great."
2,The Beginning of the End,"This sprawling, widely improbable yarn is the demarcation point between the lean, muscular early Spenser novels and the later, weaker novels in the series. Spenser and Susan are separated, but when she finds herself in trouble, Spenser rushes to the rescue. At 384 pages, the novel dwarfs earlier entries in the series, but this is not the mark of ambition. It is diffuse and unfocused. Compare it to novels like Mortal Stakes and the flawed, but powerful, Promised Land - it suffers greatly. This novel is saved from one star by my familiarity with the characters and his abiding ability to invoke a fictional milieu."
2,unbelievable,"this book is the worst spenser book. his own fantasies of love have impaired his ability to write. the relationship between spenser and susan would entitle both of them major psychiatric diagnoses and the action/adventure is of mythical proportion....come on parker, you can do better than this"
2,Spenser faces the Battle for Susan,"I had trouble getting into this story, mainly because the characters didn't behave as I am accustomed with so many other Spenser novels. The whole storyline was a little too weird for me, and I refuse to believe our government would pardon a criminal on the condition that he perform a covert action that wouldn't pass the ""Washington Post test""."
1,The beginning of the end for the Spenser series,"This was the first book in the Spenser that indicated something weird was going to happen. Catskill Eagle signalled the beginning of the end for the Spenser series. They've gone completely down hill since it's publication (although in fairness there has not yet been a Spenser novel as awful as A Catskill Eagle). Parker suddenly tried to turn Spenser in James Bond, having him invade hidden underground bases and the like. The book makes no sense."
5,I want to Join,"I want to join THE NAISA MAFIA.... I am Vietnamese and the godfather has my name so people run and hide before I take over. Great book with details and actions, even I would do in life, to become the most powerful.... Chau whenever you are around my block recruiting members, look me up in Little Saigon.... I am your man...."
2,Well this was obvious,"I haven't read the book, but based on the reviews, I don't think I will. All the 5-star reviews written about this book are created by either the author or a friend. I know that because their review history only cover books written by Mr. Truong there. I will give you two stars for effort though."
4,Naisa,"A very kinetic story, with solid dialoge and scene structure and as crime dramas go this is up there with some of the best. Sounds like a movie hu? Damn right it should be."
5,The Naisa Mafia,"Where is my review? I read 'The Naisa Mafia' on my car trip to Vegas. My friend handed it to me because he wanted to listen to his gangster hip hop. I never read anything so real and I felt for almost every character. If you want to thug, join the baddest gang in town. NAISA recruiting then try me because I want in.........."
1,Haven't read his book...and I don't think I will.,I chatted with the author online and he has no character. He came off to be very arrogant and disrespectful.
4,You must hear...,"This set is worth hearing just for the part of Pamina, sung by Christiane Oelze. A golden-tonsiled soprano, whose tone is as clear as a bell, with a subtle vibrato. All around a great performance, and great sound."
5,Great!,"Great performance, really brings the music alive. Terrific sound quality. You just can't turn it off."
5,This is great!,I really love this SPF Face Cream....it is a high SPF which I like becuase the sun can be so harmful. So 30 SPF is great protection for my face. I also like the fact that it doesn't feel heavy on my face...or greasy. It also improves the texture of my skin too! I really love this cream and I think I am going to stick with this one.
2,BURNS,IT BURNS MY EYES EVEN IF I KEEP IT ONLY ON MY CHEEK BONES AND LOWER. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT
5,Outstanding,"This is excellent for workout. I've seen the group a number of times in person, they are as wonderful a performer as their music."
2,Too Big for Oven,"This is a wonderful pizza pan...nonstick, durable, and sturdy. BUT it does not fit in my oven!! Unlike other 14 inch pizza pans, this one has a wide rim, causing it to be much more than 14 inches in diameter. Measure your ovens before buying it, because it is actually 16+ inches."
5,ATZA PIZZA!,"NICE PIZZA PAN...I BOUGHT TWO. LARGE, THICK, NONSTICK...JUST MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A DECENT SIZE OVEN FOR IT. BE CAREFUL CUTTING PIZZA WITH SHARP INSTRUMENTS ON THIS SURFACE. I ALSO USE IT TO WARM UP FOODS ON AND TO PLACE UNDER POTENTIALLY OVERFLOWING OR GREASY CONTAINERS AS WELL. BUT BEWARE THIS NONSTICK MATERIAL IS EXTREMELY SLIPPERY AND YOU CAN EASILY LOSE THE CONTENTS WITH A SLIGHT TIP! EXCELLENT PRICE FOR SUCH A WELL MADE PRODUCT."
3,Very good but a little slow in parts,"Dean Koontz ""The Bad Place"" was a very good book. I would reccomend it to anyone who likes to try and figure out what is going on before the book tells you. Because you might have an idea but chances are with this book you will not unravel the whole story.The only thing I didn't like was that it go a little too explanitory when it came to tell about Candy. I often found myself skimming and not actually taking in everything that was written because it was getting off the pace the book was intended to take. But, if I was asked if I would reccomend it I would have to say yes. It is very exciting and the end is great!!!"
5,This is where it all started.,"This is the first Dean Koontz book that I read, and got me to be one of his biggest fans. If you are considering reading a Koontz novel this is a great one to start with. He will keep you in suspense with his masterful stoty telling. You won't put it down. You will be afraid of the bad place too!"
5,from a writers point of veiw........,"This is the book that made me into an avid Dean Koontz reader. I never though that a book could actually keep me up at night, wondering if a terrifying creature like Candy was lurking within the shadows of my closet. This book took me to places-bad places that i never wanted to venture in before. But for all the horrors, and all the grotesque scenes I invisioned, in the end I was .......horrified yet invigorated, disgusted yet intranced, and waiting patiently in line for the movie. Koontz, you are a god in the world of macob thrillers and I, as a author, give you my uttmost praise and awe. Thank you for the late-night frights."
5,This book will make you a Koontz fan,"My uncle gave me this book to read and it was the best. I couln't put it down. It was mysterious and compelling. Since then I've read ""Phantoms,"" ""Shadowfires,"" ""Eyes of Darkness,"" and ""Whispers."" ""The Bad Place"" was by far the best except ""Phantoms."" ""The Bad Place"" was cleverly writen and answered all of the questions the book brings to mind. And the answers aren't rediculous and stupid like other want-to-be great fiction authors. Read this book and you'll be a fan for Life!!!"
1,Made me swear off Koontz forever,"I loved Watchers, Lightning, and the Mask. But this book was SO disgusting and creepy I had to take a bath inside and out. It literally left a bad smell in my nose. I haven't read anything of his since."
3,Not one of Koontz's finest,"I've read (or at least started) about a dozen of Dean Koontz's books, and enjoyed most of them. I gave up on a couple -- just too gory -- but have enjoyed the rest to one degree or another. Ranking them, I'd have to say that The Bad Place falls nearer the bottom of the list than the top.As usual, the main villain is worse-than-awful and Koontz paints a vivid image. But while there's a fair amount of intrigue as the plot unfolds, he really seems to go on autopilot near the end. An OK page-turner (I read it on an airplane) but there are better choices: Lightning and Dark Rivers of the Heart, to name just two."
3,average at best,"If you haven't read any of Koontz's books don't start with this one. The characters are not very real and the plot is loosely thrown together. It seems like he didn't spend much time writing this book. If you want to read a good Koontz book, read ""Dark Rivers of the Heart"" or ""Strangers"". Worth reading if you're a Koontz fan, though."
3,Great story that falls flat.,"Throughout The Bad Place, Dean Koontz creates a numberof vivid scenarios that rank among some of his scariestworks. The story is very promising throughout mostof the book. Unfortunately, the book closes with oneof Koontz's weakest endings, leaving you unfulfilled.A very disappointing finish to what started out as sucha great book"
2,"It Is, Indeed","We were bad. So Koontz put us in this place.This is one of several Koontz entries that reads wonderfully, right up until he gives us the explanation for what the cause of the inexplicable paranormal phenomenon is. He stretched real hard, for this one. On his better days, he may try credibility to the point of teetering, but here he just falls right off the edge. More than one of his books from this period does the same thing.On the plus side, the characters are quite well-developed and generally interesting, as they usually are with Koontz - Thomas Dakota, a Downs Syndrome sufferer, is especially appealing. The book's problem is ultimately just throwing reality out the window and going just a little too far into The Twilight Zone, a habit Koontz has fallen more frequently into in recent offerings.If the author's endings for Lightning, Dragon Tears or From the Corner of His Eye didn't bother you, you'll love this book. If any one of them put you off, this one will, too."
4,"a good, fast-paced horror story","I read this book as a teenager. It was so good that I read it slow, at a neighborhood park at night, underneath a small, dim lantern, and cherished every word. As Koontz often did in his earlier works, he captures you quickly with intense action, unique circumstances (such as with this novel of a man waking up in an alley not knowing who he is), and leaving the reader wanting to know more. The perspective is third person and it flips around from different characters. One of the best characterizations of a Down syndrome man is done in this book. It leaves you dripping with empathy for him and hoping for the best.Also, the characterization of Julie and Bobby are fun to hang out with, even in the slow parts. The plot does a good job of worsening the situation for the protagonists to a climax of impending doom. A horrific antagonist with immense power is well-characterized. A good horror story all around.Dean Henrysonauthor of Fierce Peace"
4,Wild and Twisted,"Frank Pollard is terrified. Someone or something is after him and he has no idea why. He has lost his memory. Bobby and Julie Dakota are a husband and wife private eye team who decide to help Frank find out who he is and who is after him. But as Bobby and Julie uncover more information the more bizarre the case becomes until the unimaginable truth comes out.This story is typical Dean Koontz. The characters are deep and well written, the action is fast paced, and the climax is full of twists and turns. This story is more bizarre and twisted than some of his others, but strangely entertaining nonetheless."
3,Another good book,"I just finished reading The Bad Place and it was a good book. At first I did not think I was going to be able to get into it. Not that it was low to start, on the contrary it started with a bang. Just for one reason or another I didn't feel it. Well as the story went on the story continued to get better and I ended up really liking it. There was just something there that I can't explain that kept me from rating the book as great.The charcters are very good. The only one I didn't greatly care for was Mrs. Dakoda. Dean seemed to be trying to make her a little to tough. This is a very, very small flaw though and another reader my not feel that way at all. The villians were very Unique and well thought out. I have never encountered anything quite like them anywhere else.If you like Koontz and are a fan of this type of story, then I would recommend this book, but there are better Koontz books out there."
4,Made my skin crawl!,"This book kept me interested and at times fascinated. I have to give Koontz credit for having one incredible imagination and coming up with some very creative ideas, even if some of them really didn't tie into the story well. The dialogue is at times phony, and the man/woman relationships in the books seem cheesy, but this is still a heck of an entertaining book. It was my first crack at a Koontz book and good enough that I plan to go back for more."
3,Disappointing,"As a fan of Dean Koontz this book was very disappointing. There was way too much detail about unuseful information. The ending could of been better. I was all set up for an exciting ending, but all I could say after reading it was ""that's it?"" I felt it was a lot of jumbled words taking up space to fill the book. Koontz needed to just get to the point without all the mumbo jumbo. Sorry, but I was bored with this book."
1,The Bad Book,"I have read many of Koontz's books and I have got to say that this is the worst one that I've read to date. For those that have yet to sink their teeth into some of Koontz's better work, I would suggest Mr. Murder or Intensity. Leave this one on the shelf to collect dust. Or better yet, throw it in the trash with the rest of the garbage."
4,My review on The Bad Place,"This is one of the best books I have read from Dean Koontz. This book has a good plot. When you first start, you have no clue to what is happening, but when you get into it, you can't put it down. I love how he has the supernatural teleporting in it. I would read this again if I hadn't started another book!"
5,Review of the bad place by Larissa,"I loved the bad place book, as much as I loved the Harry Potter books. I hadn't read any books that evan came close as to the Harry Potter books. The bad place is just as good. If you like sifi and susspense, supernatural and a lot of action then I think you should read this book."
4,one of my favorite Koontz books,"The Bad Place, and Strangers are my two favorite Koontz books. In The Bad Place, Koontz is able to get bizarre and still pull you in with dazzling suspense. I agree with another reviewer that the end does seem a bit rushed, but this is still a fantastic story."
5,incredible !,"This is definitely my favorite Koontz novel. So much happens, so many genres are mixed: horror, thriller, SF. Typically Koontz, but the better side of him. It's a gripping tale that I would recommend to anybody..."
2,Way off the mark,We found this book long and hard to get through. There is a lot of graphic and pointless gore the main characters teleport all around but then the book tries to make them normal in most other respects. This was just too much of a stretch for our feeble minds.
1,A Bad Place - A Worse Read,"I was really looking forward to reading this, after hearing so many good things about it by friends who loved the author and the book -- and it was my first (and probably last) Koontz book. The story had the potential to be a good mystery -- solvable, good clues, etc. And I did end up enjoying the main characters. But the sci-fi part was awful - tacky and thin - and compromised what (with a different author) might have had hopes to be an interesting story. I felt as if I had wasted the time that it took to read this one - even though it was a rainy weekend with almost nothing else to compete!"
2,The Bad Book,"It pains me to write this about one of my favorite Authors, but this book was just plain bad. The plot dragged, and at points made no sense at all. I found this book painful to read. Unfortunately, I read this right after Relentless, which I also did not care for. Unbelievable characters, especially Candy. Too many undeveloped ideas and plot lines. I think I will take a break from Mr. Koontz for a while, and maybe re-read some of my favorite books that he wrote."
2,Cliche too much?,"I used to love Koontz' novels, despite his annoying inability to omit expressing his very narrow-minded views on Veitnam war and communism in every book. Suspence, plot and characters used to be great. But not so with this book. The main characters, a couple of PIs, seem like some comics characters - annoying and unbelievable. The villians are slightly better, but that's not saying much. The plot has been used by Koontz before in his other books. I could not get rid of this deja vu feeling through the whole book.All in all the book is readable, but quite disappointing, considering who the author is."
2,Don't bother,"This book isn't worth the read. The first half the book really sucks you in - Koontz is an amazing writer, and he develops his characters to the point that you empathize with them and really are involved with the story. The last half the book, however, was a complete let-down. It was utterly predictable, with the only twist being the uber-sexual nature of why the villain became a villain. I was so excited to see what wonders Koontz would work in that last half his book, but actually had to force myself to read it. So again, don't even bother picking this one up unless you like ""witnessing"" violent murders of children, rampages of sexual mutants, and have too much time on your hands to boot - it's a great author who's run out of material, and so just threw a ridiculous plot together to flesh out what was (originally) a pretty decent idea."
5,The Bad Place,"Dean Koontz is a Master at writing, his books make you want to always look around you and always be better at everything you do."
1,it can't get much worse,"After reading this book I can honestly say never ever read it. NEVER, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT...it took me 3 days to read and when I was done I realized I could have done so many other things with my time. Koontz books are just not what they used to be.The characters are non existant, cookie cutter to the extreme in their personalities. The main evil villian and the...little brother are the exception. They both seem to be a little better than the rest of the characters. The plot is outlandish so far into the realm of impossibility you will just die from laughter. The reason the main antagonist does the things he doees is interesting to say the least.So avoid this book at all cost, its not even close to a good Koontz book (which I find rarer and rarer these days) or even a good book in general."
5,The best Koontz book ever.,"This book will make all who read it become an instant Koontz fan. It will let you in on Dean's style of writing. He uses reality with a twist to draw you into his world, leaving his readers wanting more Koontz style of writing. This is an outstanding book that the reader will want to read more than once. Enjoy this book and look forward to the next Koontz book that you will excited to read.Jim Z."
3,"Good, though disjointed story","Koontz writes well, but his method of simultaneously discussing several ongoing stories through very short chapters makes for a fragmented tale. The disjointed approach prevents the story from ""flowing"" smoothly along. He ties everything together nicely in the end, but it takes a little patience to make it through the first portion of the book. One area where Koontz does succeed is in keeping the reader's curiosity up, as he creates and sustains the desire to find out what happens to everyone in the end. Overall, it was nice light reading."
3,Could have been a lot better,"My favorite aspect of Koontz' books are the imaginative plots they feature. This book is no exception. However, the inclusion of seriously creepy, sexually incestuous subplots ruined it for me. It would have been so much better if he'd just left that out. I wasn't scared, I was just grossed out."
1,Haven't read Koontz for years because of this book,I don't have much to say except that before the Bad Place I read all of his books and this made me litterly ill what with biting of heads of mice etc. Its been a long time and I am just now getting to the point where I might be willing to try him again. He is a good writer with interesting unusual plots but this was way to much gore!
1,"Trite, Boring and Improbable","Combines silly sci-fi with a moronic killer with no personality, and a pair of Mickey Mouse detectives, one female with a 'toughness' complex and what do you get? The Bad Place."
1,Bizarre and Confusing,"Although I am a big Dean Koontz fan and have read almost all of his books, ""The Bad Place"" is definitely not the one I would recommend. The plot is confusing and the characters simply too bizarre to bear. It seemed to me that Koontz had several ideas for different books and got them hopelessly mixed up. Getting through the first 40 pages was a drag!"
1,A Horrible Insult to my intelligence,"I always heard wonderful things about Dean Koontz books, so I went out and bought two. I read through this one in about 3 days and although it held my attention, the characters and the plot were very predictable. He always uses the same type of characters in his stories that are so perfect they couldn't possibly be believable. He also uses the same theme of pyscho related problems in which there is a fear involved that needs a hypnotist to solve. I'm just incredibly bored with his simplistic eighth grade writing and predictable themes. I'm sorry, Mr. Koontz, but neither of the books I read were worth raving about."
4,Lust For Paint,"This set features some great moments from SCTV history. Of the shows presented here, I am particularly fond of ""Zontar,"" ""CCCP 1,"" and ""The Godfather."" Catherine O'Hara and Andrea Martin steal the show, with any appearance by Perini Scleroso, Mrs. Falbo, or Edith Prickley being comedy gold. ""The Great White North"" and Guy Caballero's rants are particularly entertaining here as are Count Floyd and Dr. Tongue (especially in ""Dr. Tongue's Evil House of Pancakes."") As brilliant as I think Eugene Levy is, I still don't enjoy the Sammy Maudlin bits, which are formulaic and un-funny compared to the rest of the show.Although some of the humor is a bit dated now (as many there are numerous references to then-current events that younger viewers may not grasp), this is still a wonderful and very funny set of DVDs, which I recommend."
2,Not The Original Canadian Show,When I purchased this I thought it was the original 1/2 hour Canadian show. Instead it is the repackaged shows they ran on NBC. I found it very disjointed and cut up. Let us have the original.
5,This is my favorite SCTV season,"This one has the Godfather, CCCP1, and other classics. I think SCTV was the best sketch comedies every produced in North America. Whereas Saturday Night Live in the same period was mean spirited, more misses than hits, looks laughably dated today, and has a wildly inconsistent cast, SCTV is as funny, or funnier, today as it was then and every one of the cast is the real deal --all comic geniuses."
5,Product as stated,I received these disks quickly and they play fine. This was a difficult set to find and I am very happy I purchased it. I have no problems and I recommend.
4,From LaRue to You (part two),"hello, i am bill needle, and this my beat, DVD Review. You know, its one of those reviews that lets you read whats on the dvds without buying and then go and talk to your friends like you have seen it. WELL BILL NEEDLE DOESNT PLAY THAT GAME! If you want to know how good these dvds are, fork out the greenbacks and go buy the damn thing. I dont like DVD Beat folks, so maybe i will be back or maybe i wont.PS If any of you poor slobs out there cant afford to buy the dvds, why dont you get a damn job like I did...i have been working since I was 13...nobody gave me any money to buy some damn dvds..whats wrong with you people...."
1,This is E.O.N. (jazz) not EON (techno),"This CD is E.O.N. progressive/acid jazz from Australia, not EON the Dune sampling hardcore techno duo from the early 90's. I am not a Jazz fan, so I cannot say how good this album is."
5,Shag-a-delic!,"I found this World of Swing Shag series just what I have been looking for. This series can take you from the Basic Shag steps into more Shag moves than you can remember! That's why the whole Shag series is a must have for Swing dancers. Whenever you need to brush-up on the basics or review/lookup moves for a nights dancing, jam session or competition, just pull out this collection of great shag material for reference. The included Shag-jams are good entertainment and can give you great ideas on how to use all the shag moves you will learn from these tapes."
3,Not as agressive as said.,This item is not as agressive at cutting grease as it advertised. It is very harsh on the skin also. I would have to try another brand before buying this one again.
1,Oil Eater Review,"This stuff is for real, cutting through old and grease like nothing else that I have ever used! I highly recommend this product."
2,Oily stains on Deck,"I bought this product after reading other reviews about it's ability to remove oil stains. I have oil stains on my Composite wood decking with some dark residue caused by the Woodbridge NJ Township spraying by helicopter for mosquotios. I sprayed the Oil eater undiluted let it settle then scrubbed very hard with deck scrub brush by hand, spraying more as needed, let it work for some more time and washed with garden hose thoroughly. The darkness of the stains in gone but I can still see the stains although faded. The deck looks slightly faded too because I had to use undiluted Oil eater other wise it wasn't making any difference. I do not agree with the manufacturer's claims that it will remove oil stains guranteed. Unsatisfactory product. Shipping was unsatisfactory too. I was charged $11.44 just as much as the cost of the product itself, ordered it on Sep 24, 2011 and received it on Oct 4, 2011 - 13 days!! Unsatisfactory."
2,Not applicable for all oil-based stains,"I decided to buy it after reading from reviews that it worked on driveways. It only worked on a certain concrete stain which I think is all motor oil, but you have to apply it again and again until most of the stain is gone. Other stains that were petroleum based, no effect at all. If you're looking at cleaning your concrete driveway, go to your local auto parts store, they have a few products you can try. I found one that worked better than this product."
5,Best Ever,This is the best degreaser I have fround in the last fifteen years. use both in an industrial and home use for cleaning repaired and new production parts.Meets all the factory claims and seems safe to use. Would continue to purchase this product.
5,BEST DEGREASER AND LAUNDRY AID,"Absolutely love this product but hate that it is not available in local stores! wish Sam's club or walmart carried it in the gallon and larger sizes so I didn't have to pay to have it shipped and wait for it. I use it primarily on laundry, my husband works outside and really gets his uniform shirts dirty and and ugly ring around the collar and sweat stains and boy does it sure clean it like no other product I have tried! I also use it to remove mildew and films off exterior of home, garage doors, vinyl siding, and for degreasing,and overall general cleaning etc. Find that I can buy this product in lieu of numerous others which do not clean as well. They need to sell in common local stores or auto part stores without diluting it to a watered down version so more people can experience how great a product it is. Pep Boys carries it but I don't have one close by, nearest 2 hours away!. Try it I am sure you will find many uses for it."
5,The Dish Review,"What a fabulous find. I don't remember this coming out in theaters but when I rented it, I had to have it for my DVD collection. Wonderfully entertaining for the whole family; great characters, and if you remember the music of 1969, you're gonna love it, too. I don't think I've ever seen Sam Neil in a ""bad"" movie."
2,Incredibly Boring!,"There is almost nothing remotely funny or interesting about this movie. The plot centers around a remote town in Australia that is providing a communication link with Apollo 11, the first manned trip to the moon. There's a bit of snarkiness between the American representative and the Australians at the radio telescope site, visits from high ranking Australians and the American Ambassador. Supposedly this is a true story - so what."
2,Charming movie but shame about the dialogue,"I was more than a little surprised when I started watching 'the dish'. I was told it is a comedy but in actual fact, it is quite a serious look at Australia's part in the 1969 moon-landing.It is a charming and fresh movie for all the family. Not historially correct but still a good watch.So why only 2 stars? In truth, I was more than a little irritated by the racist comment made at dinner, about ""India having no tellie"".Just so that the general public is not totally misinformed by this, India started TV broadcasting on September 15 1959, so I am sure they would have been glued to their TVs like everyone else."
4,"Two Thumbs Up From Down Under, Based On A True Story","Apollo 11's astronauts will walk on the moon. The 1000-ton satellite dish in Parkes, Australia is designated as the receiving dish for the walk on the moon. The movie is the story of the drama as the Aussie's crew get ready for that magic moment when they will be televising the event around the world. Right before the big event the dish flatlines. It is touch and go for awhile."
5,one of those terrific little Aussie films,"A little town in the Australian outback contributes to the satellite feed for Neil Armstrong's walk on the moon. Everything does not go well. And then there are the sheep. A warm and wonderful little film populated with quirky, original characters with whom you'll be glad to spend a couple of hours."
2,Movie was boring,"Movie started off with an appealing title, and Sam Neill; however, after 10 minutes it became boring. It seemed bo be more a documentary rather than an interesting fictionalized portrayal. The acting was wooden even by Mr. Neill."
5,Obscure WONDERFUL true story...,"Sam Neil and a lovely cast tell the true tale of the remote Australian tracking station of the FIRST Apollo moon landing. It is quirky and has historic footage of the day the world watched and waited to see Man on the Moon. The people of the small town's reaction to the notariety is comical, a study in human nature. I remember this time and the characters are true to time and space..it is a sweet movie...I remembered it and purchased it happily."
5,"Great DVD, No skips",Received the DVD on time in appropriate packaging. The DVD did not have any skips or problems. It was a joy to watch!
5,An Unexpected Charmer,"I bought a VHS copy of this film two or three years ago, and it sat, unwatched, in my video cabinet since then. The other night a friend and I were shuffling through the collection looking for something to watch, when she mentioned she'd seen ""The Dish"" and liked it, and wouldn't mind seeing it again.It was the perfect choice. Light, but not shallow, the film covers a few days in 1969 when a radio telescope observatory in a small, remote Australian town became a pivotal link in the Apollo 11 mission. The story portrayed is fictional- though based on some real events- and is really about how this event changes the people connected with it. It is unabashedly romatic, which at the same time true to the spirit of Apollo, and the people who supported the mission.A delightful film for the entire family."
5,Weaving in 1914,"Enjoying the book for its historical reference.As a weaving teacher, for children, I find itvery interesting and informative. Reminds us ofvalue once given to preparing students for work."
1,Not very helpful,"I did not find this book very helpful. I was looking for basic instruction, but this book has no illustrations, and without them, it just isn't worth the time it took to download it. If you are looking fot a book on teaching theory, circa 1900, this is for you. Otherwise, don.t waste space on your reader."
2,Hand-Loom Weaving a Manual for School and Home,I thought there would be pictures to go along with the instructions . My mistake. The book was not rewarding for me so I never finished it
2,Sad little book,Didn't have the information I was looking for. There were no patterns at all.It might be usefull for a begining weaver.
3,It is so unbelievable it must be true!,"This goes beyond the barely credible `Strangers Among Us'. There is so much in here that settles in the unconscious mind - but on the surface, too much appears beyond credibility. Surely, as much as we want it to be true, how can it be. More supporting evidence would ease the disbelief. Ruth, expand on your thoughts and give us more hope. Unfortunately, with hindsight, many of the millennium predictions are still to occur, maybe they are late, but it doesn't help credibility. More reference to pure UFOlogy is also required, but don't let this put you off. If just for thought provoking UFOlogical reading it is another must - read it and wonder!"
2,A Bit Dated,"I thought this would be a more modern view and instruction of the role of Altar Server. However, it is not. I did not find it useful although the advertising for the book made it appear up-to-date."
2,beautiful but flawed,"This book is beautiful to look at and inspiring in terms of purse designs. However, the how-to instructions are unclear and incomplete. Granted, some designs offer better explanations than others. I would not recommend this book to a beginner. It is more suited to be a coffee table book or else as inspiration for the more experienced craftsperson."
5,Great Book!,"This was a great book with wonderful ideas, beautiful pictures, great patterns and limitless possibilities. If you are interested in making purses I would get this book."
2,Not what was advertised!,"I just recieved my skirt in the mail. From the picture and discription I was expecting a slightly thicker nicer material to be used. It is realy a thin satin like material. I also expected the skirt to be ankle length!!! It was definatly not!!! Not even close!!! I am averaged sized, so I didn't think it would be so short. My third complaint is the size. According to the description a small is a 6 to 8, and I was worried about it being big. It is smaller!! The true size is close to a 2 to 4 on the small. Buyer beware."
2,not as family friendly as I would have liked,"I put this in the dvd player for us to watch as a family. Big mistake. Not for children. I came to a scene where they were sitting on a couch and they girl wanted to have sex. He didn't. She got mad. I turned it off. Later, by myself, I put the dvd back in to see where that scene was going. It looked clean enough from there, but I still chose to throw it away because of that one scene. I am a prude and don't like my kids to watch anything with an element of ""casual sex"" to it. I definitely think it gave the right message, but not good for younger kids if you are like me and try to only show your young children that sexual things are only between a husband and wife. This movie pulls it together with the message, but I didn't want that one scene sticking in my young children's minds."
4,Good,"Just like a woman, pray for what you wantand when God, gives it to you, You don'tknow how to except it."
4,Long Time Dead,"I thought this movie was a creepy one, in a non-Steven Spielberg movie made kind of way. It had me very interested. Towards the middle/ending of the movie, is where it started to make sense and come together. I don't recommend watching this movie alone at night! I liked it, regardless of the quality, actors, or whom directed it. It's still a movie worth watching, although I had a hard time finding it, so I bought it. Hope to see more reviews on this movie!"
3,Pretty chilling little movie,"I see by the other reviews here I'm the lone ranger but, nonetheless, I was surprised that this movie actually kept me interested and was actually a little frightening towards the end. Let me put it this way: there's a whole lot of so-called ""horror"" movies I've seen in recent years (slasher films, the Screams, the Final Destinations, the Last Summer flicks, 13 Ghosts, etc.) and I'd put this movie a few notches above them. Truly scary movies are harder and harder to come by and this one delivered for me."
2,Horrid,"This movie was a major letdown. I only bought it because I wanted to see a recent Lukas Haas film. After viewing, I must say that I really don't understand why he would even waste his talents on such trash. Not.good.at.all. (and I want my 28 bucks back...)"
4,A Great Read!,"This is one incredible Sci-Fi read . It really can't be absorbed in one reading. It does have some really good Hard Sci-Fi and is thankfully bereft of the ""Sexy"" implausable starships common to the drivel written by the likes of David Weber, and Gene Rodenberry's Star Trek farce. The characters aren't as strong as they could be. Which is a failing i've noticed in all technical speculative fiction, most recently noted in Jeff Cramer's Einstein's Bridge. I highly recommend it, although better characterization and stronger female characters ( Strong female characters don't have to be vindictive shrews ), would have made it a 9 in my book. I also recommend the sequel ""The Killing Star""."
3,Impressive and yet incomplete,"The book had everything to be one of the most exciting books I've ever read, but... The plot seemed incomplete. The book just finishes, abruptely... just when I tought there was something more...Don't get me wrong, I liked it very much but it lacks something, maybe deliberately. Especialy about Chris and his digressions..."
3,A fast and fun read.,"After reading a couple of Jack Higgins ""Sean Dillon"" books, this was a nice read. The premise: identical twins who share a passion for flying are separated shortly before WWII. Max goes to Germany and Harry stays in the US. The two quickly rise to great fame in the airforce on opposite sides of the war.This book reminds me of an old movie. The boys are exceptional pilots who seem to forget they are fighting a war. They just want to continue to do what they are good at: blowing the enemy out of the sky (with or without guns). They follow each other's careers with great interest and share a respect for one another that rises above their allegiance to their countries.OK, so the book isn't deep. It certainty isn't Winds of War. I will say it kept me awake at night reading by my flickering nightlight."
1,Boring,I quit reading when I realized there was no more to this book than the hero receiving one more medal as he tries to get out of transferring to his own air force.
2,Most disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Higgin's works but this book is far below the quality of his usual output. If you've never read Higgins, don't do yourself a disservice by starting with this novel as he's written far better works. Try THE EAGLE HAS LANDED, SOLO, COLD HARBOUR, ANGEL OF DEATH and DRINK WITH THE DEVIL.The main problem with this particular, outside of it being too predictable , is simply that too much of the story is put into narrative form. In other words, Higgins rushes through what happens in a summary fashion rather than detailing the pieces more and laying out the emotional context."
1,"Absolute drivel, and the reviews say that this is his best","book to date. I'm glad I didn't receive any of his other books as gifts. Higgins has no talent for dialogue, the book has no depth, dimension or detail and the characters are poorly wrought. This book made the NY Times Bestseller list, I weep for the future. Do not be fooled by the mass media reviews - this book is a waste of time."
2,Below HIggins' standards,"This book backfired. Teh description of the aces are totally unconvincing. Nobody in the RAF ever destroyed the amount of enemy planes as character Harry Kelso did... THe book is naive, every time giving us boring brief descriptions of facts about WW II well known to all of us. It was a pain in the a... to read it."
1,"anachronisms galore in ""flight of eagles""","Higgins's Flight of Eagles left me wishing he had done his homework. There are multiple clankers that litter this story. First, the W.W. I German air force was not called the Luftwaffe. Second, I seriously doubt a German baroness would be working in an Allied military hospital in 1917; she would be behind barbed wire in an internment camp. Third, the Finnish Air Force of 1940 was not equipped with the Focke Wulf 190. That aircraft did not appear in combat until considerably later. All of this distracted my attention from the plot, such as it is. I find Higgins's attempts to sanitize those who served the Gestapo and other Nazi units, such as the SS, distasteful and egregious. In short, I did not like this work on several levels."
2,Pleasantly dull,"I'm not a great writer so I'm a little reluctant to criticize someone else but this was really a dull read. I felt like the author wrote it over a weekend, between walking the dog and dining with friends. Don't get me wrong, there's something about WWII espionage-type books that pull me in, and I enjoyed sections of this one, but the shallow characters and unbelievable story (why, exactly, were all these generals and assorted bigshots always so eager to allow Harry Kelso into their cirle?) made me feel as though the author never really tried very hard. By the time I was 2/3 of the way through the book I was very happy I had got at the library and not spent money on it."
3,"Good plot, superficially written.","One expects rather tougher action in these days, and that's where this book fails, in my opinion. The plot, identical twins separated before WW2, one living in Germany and the other in the USA, is very well thought of. Their rise in their cultures and exploits in fighter combat is a little short of depth and the ending of the book is somewhat cursorily treated. We do get an in-depth picture of London during war times and some of the intelligence work done by both sides, but the main characters of the novel are a little two-dimensional. On the other hand, the supporting gallery of personae are well thought out and carry the story. Many dramatic things happen, both in the present and back in various decades, and the author's deft hand holds it nicely together. All in all, a good read during vacation while waiting for a plane or whatever, but for a better read on a somewhat similar subject I recommend Colin Willock's *The Fighters*"
5,Outstanding book,I loved reading this book. A truly riveting story. My only disappointment was when I was finished reading it. Like an empty glass and me with a thirst for more.
5,Flies high!,"Higgins' Flight of Eagles is fine novel of war in the air, much in the flavor and style of The Triumph and the Glory or Flight of the Intruder."
5,A Great Read,"I enjoyed this book greatly. I have only read a couple of other Higgins books, but will be sure to read them all now.If you like WWII tales, this is a MUST."
2,Not his best work.,"I have enjoyed Higgins' novels in the past, but this one did not live up to what I was expecting. I thought the characters were a bit too melodramatic, and the plot seemed to rub against the same plot in ""The Eagle has Landed"". How many times did Hitler plan to kill Eisenhower? I would rather read the stories about the IRA and Sean Ryan than this book. I am glad that I read the book, though, because it got me back in touch with Higgins. I would advise people if they want to read this book, to get it from the library instead of buying it."
3,Nice Read,"Great and engrossing novel. Jack Higgins as always has plotted the true story about the twins,Max and Harry Kelso, who were born flyers, in a very enchanting way. Once you start the book you never feel like keeping it down. The book touched me soo much that I thought of nothing but Kelso twins for days."
2,Not one of his best,"I am Higgin's fan since the Eagle has landed, but I found this book a disappointment. A bit too melodramatic. Abit too easy to guess. I also wish Mr. Higgin would come up with something new and exciting: he can do that, he has done so to us readers before. How many letter signed by Hitler himself were there in that war? (The gimmick was exciting in the Eagle has landed, but to use this trick again in Night of the Fox and again in this book was a bit too much.) How many more islands in the Channel would Higgin propup again? The deception-upon-deception up to a point is boring. In The Eagle has landed German team impersonated as Polish soldiers, only to find out Mr. Churchill was also an imposter. In Night of the Fox somebody acted as Rommel and the hero impersonated as SS officer. In ""Filght"" - Impersonating again. Please ! Even the Name Kelso was recycled from Night of the Fox. I find this really too much."
4,Powerful Thriller,This book contains the advantage of getting the reader into the story. The story is of two little boys and their dad was a pilot in WWI and then he passed away and the boys were seperated. One stayed in the US and one went to Germany with his mother. The rest is to be read..........This book holds a captivating a descriptive story. The story line is gripping and possesing. A great read!
1,Higgins has done a poor rewrite of The Eagle has Landed.,"I love W.W.II thrillers, but each of Jack Higgins' books seems to get progressively sillier. All the men in this one are tall, brave, noble, taciturn, multi-lingual, etc., which is par for the genre, but they also are made to follow a plotline which is preposterous. Most of the action takes place as a kind of respite from having dinners in famous hotels. When not drinking or eating in these well paneled watering holes, they go out to dispatch an enemy or two, each time picking up another medal as if it were a sort of tip. This goes on in a kind of repeating cycle, until, half way through, Higgins seemed to remember he needs a climax and recycles his Eagle Has Landed bit. The first time he did this schtick, it was good; this time it's just a way to get to the end. Shabby. Where's Forsythe when we need him?"
2,One of his worst efforts,"I first must admit that I could not put down ""Flight of Eagles"". Not because it was so engrossing, but I was desparetly hoping that it would get better.Reasons abound for this poor review not the least of which is it's total predictability. The very end is seen comming by page 60 or sooner.The second reason for my discontent is that the two boys lives parallel each others so much that it is as if Mr. Higgins became tired and took a short cut by really only writing about one boy and then cloned the other.Next, why personalize the book by putting himself and his wife in the story?I am sure that Mr. Higgins will not let us down the next go around. He is capable of so much better as we have all seen in the past. Signed,A reader in New York by way of Connecticut."
5,Only one problem,"There is only one problem with Jack Higgins, he doesn't write 10 books a year. This, the latest in a long line of winners, offers us a small autobiographical peak (truth or not) and is as tightly plotted as any. The great thing about Higgins is that he offers us completely unbelievable plots, then makes us believe them. Highly recommended."
4,Clarks Terrain Oxford,Great shoe. Would be nice if it had a padded tongue. Some difficulty untieing because top string buckles that are difficult to work with.
4,Rock Solid performer,"This is my 3rd pair in the last 4 years. These are comfortable, good looking business casual shoes. They are very good on hard and wet surfaces. As long as they are being made I will be buying this model. The first pair lasted 2 years before I wore the soles out walking on hard surfaces. Very comfortable in a Healthcare environment"
1,Don't waste your money on this book!,"Don't bother to buy this book. David Adler merely collectsfacts about the life of Abraham Lincoln and connects them together. Alist of facts do not a story make! Lincoln was a fascinating man, with a sense of humor and a strong will and an honest character who seems to have truly cared for others. None of this comes out in Adler's books. Not even listed as facts in his boring way. I gave the book one star because the artist shouldn't be punished for illustrating the wrong book. But the people in the pictures are barely identifiable. Buy another biography, like Abraham Lincoln, which won a Caldicot award and has been around for decades. I doubt Adler's book will last that long."
1,Inappropriate for little ones,"As others have pointed out, the book is not a story per se, but rather a combination of facts about Lincoln and the time in which he lived. That being said, several of the facts included in the book are inappropriate for early elementary-aged children. Slave auctions, Civil War, assassination, etc. Granted, these are significant aspects of Abe Lincoln's life, but there is no need to include passages like the one detailing Lincoln's assassination in a book geared towards 4-8 year olds. Additionally, the illustrations leave a lot to be desired. In several of the pictures, Lincoln looks like he's Chinese. You have perhaps the most iconic presidents and you can't even depict him in the correct manner. The assassination pages shows Booth pointing a pistol at the back of Lincoln's head. Seriously? The publisher thought this is what 5 year olds should be seeing/reading? Don't waste your money on this book."
3,Kinda over-expensive and crappy.,"I received this as a Christmas present from one of my friends, and when I began drawing with these pencils the tip automatically broke on the drawing, so I resharpened it and it did SORTA well, but the color didn't come out as good as I would have liked. On the first sharpen, this pencils automatically break and you have to sharpen them a few times which I really don't like. I suggest buying if you need a big variety of colors, but its defiantly not worth the price. Sorry Prismacolor!"
2,Buyer Beware!,"I found that the ""lead"" inside these pencils to be broken. I sharpened only to have the ""lead"" fall out, again and again...it is so frustrating to buy something so expensive and have it be crap! I am not alone on this, I only wish I would have read reviews both good and bad before making such a purchase. I would recommend Faber-Castell, they are sturdy and the colors are beautiful, I also find Sanford to make a lovely color pencil. Hope this helps in your decision."
1,Terrible,I'm an art student and I have used most Prismacolor products on the market. Prismacolor is the worst I've ever used. They break the moment you sharpen them (turns out the actual color strip inside ALL the pencils was in pieces and broken and this was true with nearly every expensive Prismacolor set I bought) WAAAAAY over priced and basically crappy pencils.
5,Great Edition of Dostoyevsky's Short Stories,"I bought the book new from amazon and will say that the poor reviews of this book are not true. The book has a Table of Contents, Headings, and page numbers. It is not a ""raw scan"" or a ""lump of words."" Worth the money for short works from one of the greatest Russian authors."
2,Not for everybody,"This is a good beginner novel, a novel for which you don't have to think. It was rather poorly written from the start, with transparent language and sophisticated sentences (a little TOO sophisticated). Oh well. Try it for yourself--maybe you'll like it--but I didn't much care for it."
1,THE CANNONBALL RUN of 2004,"Do you get the feeling that these movies are only strung together from the cast's ""pranking"" and ""joshing"" sessions from ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT and ACCESS HOLLYWOOD?Like THE CANNONBALL RUN and the abominable CHARLIE'S ANGELS films, these movies look like they were far more fun to make than to actually watch."
3,"Well the first one wasn't exactly brilliant, either.","There is so much badness here, from Don Cheadle's fake English accent to Matt Damon trying to be as annoying as possible. But somehow I found the idea of these megastars, many of whom are worth more than these guys are trying to steal, kinda funny."
2,Drowning,"The problem with ""Oceans 12"" is that it is too long. Director, Steven Soderbergh, who should have known better, needed to apply the pruning shears and cut this film by at least 15 minutes.A caper film should be an hour and a half max unless, like the classic ""Rififi"", it has something to say about human nature or what drives people to steal.Soderbergh knew on the git-go that O12 was not going to be ""The Italian Job"" much less ""Rififi,"" so he should have allowed it to be: fun, spare, witty and less that one hour and forty minutes. But at two hours it just drags.All the Dudes (Pitt, Clooney, Damon, Cheadle, Mac, etc.) seem to be having a great time joking each other, making fun of Catherine Zeta Jones and eating and drinking the finest that Europe has to offer. The only problem with this Camaraderie is that it leaves US out. Watching much of O12 is like watching the home movies of someone we do not know: I mean to be polite, we Ohh and Ahh, but basically we don't give a damn."
3,Running On Low,"The remake of OCEAN'S ELEVEN had a certain charm and drive with its character based and motivated plot behind it. It was a fun movie. OCEAN'S TWELVE seems a bit contrived and protracted. There is really no clear direction present and the actors look a bit excruciatingly perplexed at times as to what the con is really all about. OCEAN'S TWELVE has a certain nonchalant attitude that undermines what really could have been a good sequel. The cast is fine but they deserved a better plot and direction. A positive note Julia Roberts steals this one, but that is saying very little."
2,Why not use the whole dvd?,"We enjoyed the movie, but were very surprised that there were no special features. Seems the point of releasing the movid on dvd would be to include SOMETHING EXTRA. It's disappointing to see such a great cast in a movie that includes not a single extra!"
3,"Quirky, but not as good as 11","The movie was pretty good. You know, if you like a lot of hand-held camera work, trying unsuccessfully to cover Julia Roberts' pregnancy (and even stooping to the level of having Julia Roberts play Pregnant Julia Roberts), hearing Catherine Zeta-Jones's ever-changing quasi-British accent, and watching Brad Pitt eat every disgusting piece of junk food on the planet. No, but really, it was worth a see, and I'll probably be seeing it again (when it comes out on DVD). I had to watch Ocean's 11 two or three times just to get all the plot details straight, which I'm sure I'll have to do with this one too."
3,confusing,The movie has a great cast but so many caracters that you may fell lost just like a did the history is fun and has a sense of humor mix with adventure is a good follow up but don't missed anything or you will lost yourself on it and will have to rewind more times you care to count.The amazon instant movie streming experience is actually very good the HD is great
3,Fun movie but worst of the trilogy,I gave this three stars because while it was a well made movie the storyline strayed all over the place and had weird twists which seemed unreal and confusing at times. But any movie with George Clooney and Brad Pitt in it not to mention Matt Damon and Julia Roberts promises at least good acting if nothing else. So it was still fun to watch. I would recommend this to anyone who like Ocean's Eleven and Thirteen. Though I still think Ocean's Thirteen was the best of the three movies constituting this trilogy.
3,Ocean's Twelve,I never seen Ocean's Eleven but I heard that it was a lot better. Ocean's Twelve was to drawn out for me. I can't recommend it to a friend
1,BIG MOVIE STARS.......... WHO CARES!!!!!,Here's generally a rule of thumb I take in choosing a movie I want to go see...... If ads really push the fact that there are big name actors in it's movie then I ususally avoid seeing it. This certainly holds true with Oceans 12.
2,A waste of mega-star talent...,"Ocean's Eleven is a masterpiece and Ocean's Twelve is a faltering disappointment.Ocean's Twelve has a weak plot, bad writing, poor soft-focus photography, washed out colors, bad editing, weak direction and is a waste of mega-watt talent. It seems that the writers painted themselves into a corner and then decided to simply paint a door on the wall to escape a bad plot by using a non-existent technological solution that lacks imagination and is very disappointing. The film is generally incoherent with numerous time-sequence jumps that are difficult to follow.Ocean's ELEVEN is a keeper, Ocean's Twelve is not a film that you will want to watch again. Just rent the DVD and save some money.I watched ""eleven"" (again) and ""twelve"", back to back and the contrast between them is like day and night."
1,Typical Sucky Sequel,"How about this movie was pretty much to give this entire cast a ritzy vacation? I think they pretty much said to themselves, ""Let's shoot this movie and take a vacation at the same time so that the studio will pay for it!"" I found myself REPEATEDLY saying to myself ""Wow, this movie is pointless"" or just plain falling asleep! The movie Ocean's 11 was entertaining and had a moving plot and story line. This movie just rambles on about all the characters getting screwed by Benedict until the last 15 minutes when something exciting actually happens. This movie is just a testament to why you should leave good enough ALONE."
2,Disappointing!,"This movie was such a disappointment in so many ways. The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of the great cast. About mid-way through, it felt as though the plot was dragging. They had the potential to do something really good with it, but instead it just got convoluted and down-right hokey. That bit with Tess Ocean playing ""Julia Roberts"" was nauseating. If it was meant to be funny, it missed the mark. It almost seemed as if they re-wrote their original script to work in Roberts' real-life pregnancy. We should have seen more of Andy Garcia's character than we did. I agree with the other review that said the audience just gets ""left out"" of the action. Don't pay full price to see this one!"
2,Boring...,The first movie was great! i loved it! I expected this to be as great as the first or maybe even greater but it failed to deliver. The plot was not great and it was kind of boring... But I was glad to see the actors come back for the sequel.
2,whew...glad I'm not the only one!,"I feel like I'm in an Oceans Twelve support group after reading many of these reviews...I too felt a bit lost watching this movie (unlike the superior Oceans Eleven), so it's good to see I wasn't alone with that thought. Other than to make boatloads of money, I don't see the point of O12 even being made...several characters that were integral in O11 are now reduced to dead weight, the timelines are confusing and seemed to be put together ""on the fly"", the ""plot"" hardly gets off the ground, and the in-jokes border on being downright annoying. I'll give it 2 stars for the soundtrack and some of the visuals, but the actual movie is an anchor..."
3,"Good, clean fun...","The plot, as it is, occurs when Andy Garcia tracks Ocean's Eleven down and demands his money back, with interest. OK, that means more stealing. However, once they try to pull off their heist, things get a bit more complicated.Ocean's Twelve is a nice, breezy, fun movie filled with lovely things and people to look at, witty dialogue, and not much left troubling your mind when you leave the theater. Much of the humor in the film comes from celebrities making fun of the notion of celebrity. Several actors play themselves. Early in the film, the Brad Pitt character - now a hotel owner in West Hollywood - enters the trashed room of Topher Gracer (That 70's Show). ""Topher,"" he says, ""why did you have to go all Frankie Muniz on me?"" A key plot point late in the film involves Julia Roberts's character impersonating a celebrity. Steven Soderbergh could have let the joke stay there, but he kicks it up to the next level (I won't ruin the surprise)."
1,A sequel for a sequel's sake,"Ocean's eleven was original, witty, and intelligent, The plot worked well. In Ocean's eleven It looks like the original actors simply decided to make a sequel.The story line doesn't work at all, The sound and Cinematography seemed to come from some student's acting class. And finally, the scene with Bruce Willis seemed to be telling the audience ""why are you morons watching this?""Such a shame with all the talent available to the film"
2,"Suffers From ""Cannonball Run"" Syndrome","You ever watch those old Burt Renyolds ""Cannonball Run"" pictures where it seems the cast and crew are having a better time than the audience? Well this movie is like that. You are watching a insider joke for over 2 hours. Parts of it are cute, but the film is overlong and goes nowhere. The ending is so predictable it just wasn't as fun for me as the cast. The actors are walking through this mess like Barbie dolls, posing ever so pretty at the camera, then winking at it like they just told a joke. Silly! Just plain silly."
2,Blah... 2 stars is generous.,"This was not a good career move for George and co. It was not a good movie, it was not a good way for me to have to spend two hours. It was a cop-out and a cheat and annoying. They were lazy writing the script, they were lazy editing it, and they were lazy acting and editing and everything else. I was amazingly disapointed. All in all, as much as I liked the original, I disliked this one. Just stop at the original... this is just all around embarasing."
1,Unlucky 12,"Terrible movie that goes on too long and annoys the viewer. At times I couldn't even understand what the characters were talking about because they were talking over each other.Basically, the movie is senseless. The guy they stole the money from in Oceans 11 wants his money back with interest or he will kill them. So, the crew travels all over Europe trying to steal the money to pay the mobster off. Huh? They didn't expect he would be mad at them from stealing 160 million bucks? They couldn't run and hide, or try to kill this guy? Stupid."
1,"All talk, no walk!","Let's cut to the chase. This movie was terrible.A cast of wonderful actors who have proven to work REALLY well together in the past. This movie seemed more like them just having fun on a movie set together, rather than a slick movie about smooth criminals. It took way too long to get going, and the ending was, to me, verey anti-climatic.Don't waste your time.Want more Oceans 11? Watch it again, don't bother with this one."
1,Ocean's Crap,"Garbage. Trying sooooooo very hard to be hip and clever, they forgot to hire a write to write an actual script. No clever heist...no 'wow, now I get it' ...just...welll....nothing.Why did Carl Reiner even bother showing up? Terrible. Don't buy it...Would have made it a -1 if there was such a thing..."
2,Sounds like fun - can I come too?!?,"Ridiculous convoluted plot that makes no sense can't help mask the fact that this was nothing but a ploy for a bunch of Hollywood royalty to hang around and act cool for several months in Europe - on YOUR dime sucker, if you actually paid to rent or see this film in the theatre. The addition of the incredibly fashionable-to-like-right-now, Catherine Zeta-Jones was predictable as all hell, so they invented a part for her. Surprised she wasn't hocking T Mobile in the movie...The ""original"" in this series - and I use that term loosely - was bad enough. But Oceans 12?!? Let me tell you something, the Rat Pack OWNS Oceans 11 - remaking that movie would be like remaking Gone With the Wind or The Sound of Music.When will you sheep learn..."
2,"Kept waiting and waiting, and then ""Oh""","While watching the movie, I kept thinking OK, this is the big plot that will make this a good movie. Problem was, I kept thinking that throughout half the movie, then I turned to the person I was sitting with and said, ""This movie is boring."" She agreed. The movie was boring cause you kept expecting a big trick as was in Oceans 11, but all you get was a plot to fool one guy to win a bet to pay off their debts. You find out that the bet was won at the beginning of the movie, but then they did this massive plot to fool the guy, and you think, ""huh?"" As others have stated, wait for it to come up on cable/satellite. I bet Clooney and the gang are sorry for not getting paid for this movie and just going in for a percent of the profit."
3,Disappointing,"I loved ""Ocean's Eleven."" It was a smart comedy with a smart story with a great cast. This movie was a bland comedy with a bad story and still a great cast. I laughed a couple of times but most of the time I was trying to figure out what was going on. The movie is just a mess."
2,Not a good sequel,"I liked Ocean's Eleven, even though it is a remake of an older version. Ocean's Twelve did not have the same zing or sense of fun. Hollywood needs to stop recycling and come up with new ideas, that's what we're paying them to do. Don't buy, unless you are HUGE fans of the cast."
3,"wrong product, extra product, mistake in shipping??","The dvd arrived on time but I received a combo DVD of Ocean's 11 and Ocean's 12. Some might think this is a good thing, but it's for a company Christmas party and I already bought Ocean's 11. Also, sometimes the combo dvd'a aren't the best quality. While I appreciate the combo (or mistake in shipping), If I wanted a combo, I would have bought a combo."
2,Not as good as everyone says,"I saw this movie just after it came out and had very high hopes. I loved Ocean's Eleven. I thought it was fun and very smart. How silly of me to assume a sequel would be the same. I have never fallen asleep in a movie, but I came very close in this one. I don't remember cracking a smile and the story just seemed to drag along. I didn't much care for the plot and Julia Roberts playing Tess Ocean playing Julia Roberts was just a bit too much for me to find any humor in it. Rent this one or just wait until it's on HBO."
4,"Entertaining, lots of eye candy, and a relatively good story","Enjoyed this, maybe not as much as the first Ocean's (11), but it is still enjoyable, Brad is still adorable, and the plot is still there...albeit with a twist. Worth seeing and a good way to lose yourself for a couple of hours. Enjoy!"
