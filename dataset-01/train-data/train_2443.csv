3,Good and entertaining,"Chivalry is not dead, and the story is somewhat entertaining, but it isn't for everyone. These types of romance novels are for the most part, written for the times they are set in."
2,couldn't finish it,I read the reviews hoping for the best and just could not finish the book. I kept reading hoping it would get better. It just didn't.
2,Disapointment with the quality,"The product was shipped fast. But what I didn't like that it is cheaply made, the plastic was way thinner than the originial, the gaskets were a joke, very thin and then they gave you pointed screws instead of like the original that had blunt end screws; incase it slipped and fell into the pool that it wouldn't poke your liner and cause a hole. I had to retighten and retighten because we have had more problems with it dripping than what we ever had with the one before. Speaking from experience I would not buy this product again or recommend to anyone. However, it is installed and we are hoping that the product doesn't fail all the way until I get another one from some place else."
1,screws are not stainless steel so they rust,The screws are not stainless steel so they rust. It's for a pool! It should def have stainless steel parts.
5,STiCKy FinGAZ,"Phat Lyrics, Phat Beats, Phat Story Lines, this albums is one of tha best i ever heard."
4,damn this is tight,"I didn't think that sticky could hold it down solo, but after getting this album......damn it's tight. His songs are metaphoric and innovated. Who else could come up with a song named ""What if I was White""? The lyrics are sick, and the beats hypnotize you. If you like Onyx, then buy this. Definitely one of the better rap albums of 2001."
5,STICKY'S THE MAN!,A VERY UNDERRATED RAPPER FROM NEW YORK! THIS WAS A EXTREMLY GOOD TELL A STORY THREW LYRICALLY EXPLANATION! ALOT OF TODAYS RAPPERS SHOULD HAVE THE SKILL TO DO SO! WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM ITS LIKE YOUR WATCHING A GOOD THUG MOVIE! THIS CD SHOULD BE IN EVERY REAL HIP HOPPERS TOP TEN LIST!
1,A lot of misclassification,"The range of recepies offered in the book is great, but a lot of the recepies are misclassified by country/culture. Also, in the introduction part, and the part describing the history of the region, some facts are misrepresented."
1,Boooooooooooooo-ring,"Sorry, what did you say? I fell asleep while listening to this ambient twaddle. I said, booooooooooooooo-ring."
5,StarTech.com MXT101HQ 6-Feet Coax High Resolution VGA Monitor Extension Cable - HD15 M/F,This product arrived early and was exactly as described. It is a high quality cable. It is thick and a bit inflexible. I tried a couple of cheaper VGA monitor cable that did not work. I am using my monitor with my laptop. The laptop monitor is monitor 0. The second monitor is monitor 1. If pin 12 of a VGA cable is not connected then the video card cannot query monitor 1 for its capabilities. Pin 12 not being connected is fine for the primary monitor (monitor 0). But you need pin 12 to get the full capabilities of a high end monitor when it is the second monitor (monitor 1). My monitor is 1920x1080. And pin 12 proved to be essential for it to work properly as monitor 1.
4,Trying to learn English?,This book looks like it would be a great help for Navajo speakers who are trying to learn English.If a person learned even half of the expressions and words in this book they would be well on their way to speaking essential English.
2,Useful but not very,"The book is exactly what it claims to be, a dictionary of Navajo words with English translation. To be really helpful a polyglot dictionary should translate in both directions. This one does not. If I need to know the Navajo word for ""rabbit,"" I'm out of luck. A short section in the front of the book deals with pronunciation of Navajo words."
3,Hard to read,"I'm sure this is a good dictionary, but the actual printing is not very good, and therefore some words are hard to read. Also, it does not have an English-Navajo side to it, so that makes it only just so useful."
2,Good but could be better.,"When looking for Native American word lists, this was the first dictionary I came across. I bought it because it was the only one I could find. If I had spent a little more time with it before I checked out I might not have, because this dictionary is not realy just words but entire thoughts and terms. This maybe just a function of the Navajo language or it may be just the way it was edited. If you are looking for a word list this is not the book for you."
3,Fun Montana Psychedelia,"This is the fourth album from this Montana band. Features guest appearances from Deniz Tek of Radio Birdman fame, Richard Treece, from Englands 'Help Yourself' and Dave Walker (Savoy Brown, Fleetwood Mac). Although the core group of founder Ron Sanchez, Colter Langan, Jeff Arntsen, and Ron Craighead create a solid foundation for the music, the songs are varied and yet cohesive. Strains of 1960s Pink Floyd, Beatles, and others can be found within, alongside honest originals. If you dig pop and psychedelic rock, you'll love this homegrown sound."
4,Fun book!,"My daughter is a music teacher, so I got it for her in her Christmas stocking--lot of laughs with this!"
5,Great!,"The book was in great shape when I received it. It was on time. It's one of my favorites from childhood, and I was very happy to add it to my bookshelf as a music teacher. Thanks!"
2,Not the original artists,"It says it all on the back of the box, ""These albums contain new Stereo Recordings performed by the featured artists."" So if you're looking for the original recordings, this ain't them. :-("
5,Informative and Entertaining,"I had to read this book for a history class on the Cuban Revolution. I was delighted to find out that this was no ordinary history memoir--it was captivating and exciting. Macaulay presents his memoirs of his time as an American soldier in revolutionary Cuba--a shocking sentence for many to read. Yet, his detailing of the adventures he took surviving in the forests of Cuba with fellow Americans and Cubans, fighting the Batista loyalists, meeting Fidel Castro, participating in death squads, and years after the revolution make you feel as if you are participating yourself.I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the time period of the Cuban Revolution."
3,"book is in good condition , but its not on the same level as shogun",i bought this book because i love shogun and tai pan my james clavel. This book doesnt seem to be quite as inspired as those two. but the reseller did a great job in shipping the book quickly and it was in good condition
5,Another winner from Calphalon,.Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick 5-Quart Saucier with Glass LidI have other Calphalon products so when I needed to purchase a 5 quart pot I didn't hesitate to buy the Calphalon Saucier. Made chicken stir fry soup the first night I had it. Yum!! I'm sure it tasted better just because I cooked with Calphalon!!! Get one. It's a great size for all sorts of recipes.
5,Love it !!!,"Best piece I have bought thus far!! Wonderful price and love that it came in the real box, not the regular white box!Have made potatoes, soups, stew, etc...You need to have one!!"
5,commercial nonstick 5-quart saucier,"I use this pan all the time .I leave it sitting on top of my stove.I bought 4 more when they went on sale.I am giving them as gifts to my sisters.Great pan.For 24.95 how can you go wrong?Went to the outlet center and saw this pan for 86 dollars ... what a deal,I still use it almost daily."
5,Unbelievable price!,"I thought it was a mistake in pricing for this pot. I had seen the same Calphalon 5 qt. pot at a discount store for around $83. When I received my item, I was very happy with my purchase. It is definitely thicker and heavier than the Simply Calphalon line. I already own a Calphalon anodized nonstick set and this is a perfect addition. Amazon customer service was excellent by the way. My first order had a missing lid, but Amazon resolved the matter rather quickly."
5,I like it!,"I grab this pot for lots of uses. Pasta, soup, casseroles, and rice dishes. Nice size for family use, cleans up like a charm and heats up evenly. I like the sturdy handles that do not get hot and the shiny cover makes me smile in my not so pretty apartment kitchen.I use silicone utensils to protect the surface, grumbling at my husband when he used a metal pasta fork (the pot survived and so did my marriage). Great price, great value. I noticed a gourmet cooking store selling this (on clearance) for twice the price I paid here at Amazon."
5,Great 5 Qt Saucier,"I added this Calphalon non-stick saucier to my existing collection of Calphalon and I am not disappointed in the least. It is a great all purpose pot for the cooktop and was priced extremely well on Amazon. It heats well, cleans up easily and is great for chili, stews and almost anything. Highly recommend it!!"
2,- NOT AS PICTURED - Invader Zim,"I purchased this item for my Daughter. There was two different listing for the ""Invader Zim Almighty Tallest Purple"", we chose this one for the expression on his face is way cooler than the other one. She expected to get the toy as pictured, but it's not. It's just as the other generic regular ones. All in all, we got ripped off. I was going to send it back, but my daughter wanted to keep it. A picture is worth a thousand words, well, there was a thousand misleading words in this listing."
2,Beware of Nikon Scan software on Mac OS X,"The scanner is very good but the software on OS X is a joke, crashes every 5 slides, only 31 character file names, can't handle sleep. Total junk."
2,Poor scanner crippled by even worse software,"This scanner is extremely slow, taking up to several minutes per negative.The Nikon Scan software that accompanies it is ugly and tries too hard to be user friendly, often making uninvited guesses as to what it thinks you want (remember MS Office and 'Clippy'?). Changing default settings proved to be challenging and it doesn't properly handle BW negatives; the BW scans are often colorized and adjusted, even when the scan is set for ""mono"" and no adjustments.A real disappointment."
2,"Great Brand in cameras, but not in digital equipments...","I bought Nikon CoolScan 5000 ED to scan my positive and negatives. Machine scans good and sometimes perfect and before i bought it i thought it was my only need. But the scanning machine has to have a suitable software. The software they gave with the machine is really old and not user friendly. Additionally, with strip film holder, Coolscan automaticaly takes the strip but can not recognize the exact frame on the strip. Sometimes it stops the strip in the middle and shows one half from previous photo and one half from the next photo. Despite these unquality things the scanning performance is great."
5,Nikon CoolScan 5000 ED,"All I can say is the product works great, and that I could not ask for a better out come on the end product. Keep up the good work. NIKON"
3,third party software,"Just purchased this product. Although some reviews say that this scanner works with Adobe Photoshop Elements, it does not and Nikon doesn't provide any help. To use this scanner you must scan images in Nikon's software them import them into Photoshop Elements which is cumbersome. The scanned images are OK but not great."
5,Nikon Super CoolScan 5000 ED Film Scanner,"It took awhile to get used to scanner, but the learning curve is quite steep. I have an iMac PowerPC G5 and have not had any problems. The manual feed works well especially if you have to make minor adjustements to restore old slides. It is a time consuming process but the results from the 5000 ED are amazing."
3,BEWARE- no driver support for 64 bit Windows 7,"This is a great professional level scanner. Does a fantastic job on film and transparencies. BUT -- Nikon no longer provides drivers for Windows 7 on 64bit systems. You literally cannot install it on such a system. The most recent computer / system we have that will run the Coolscan 5000 drivers is an old Compaq running Windows XP. You probably can use it on a Windows Vista system, so long as it is not 64bit."
2,Slow and tedious,"Nikon makes great cameras but awful software and this unit relies heavily on software. The scanner is slow as can be and making pre-scan adjustments with the software tedious and time consuming. Much faster with Photoshop! Bulk scanning in not a viable option due to the time it takes per image. I had the APS attachment and it failed continuously to take the film in. I sent it back to Nikon for repairs with detailed description of what was wrong and it came back with the same problems unfixed. Tried it with different brand films and still wouldn't accept rolls. For such an expensive machine it is barely worth it. Certainly not if you don't have much time to fiddle. This is all sad as the quality of scan is clearly there, just the ergonomics of using this unit and the ridiculously produced software are a typical Japanese pain in the neck. If this cost 400$ which it should, my attitude would be different but for 1000$ this is a barely 2 star machine and a hassle at that."
4,Halo 2 toys,"While I am sure they were designed as collection items, my kids wanted them for play. I've purchased other Halo action figures in the past and my only complaint has been their durability. Otherwise my kids have enjoyed the heck out of them. If there is ever a Halo 4 video game made I'm sure I'll be buying more. I do have to admit Master Chief looks cool."
1,Nor worth even $1,Don't bother. If you are looking to replace a RevoStyler - this is NOT it. I have short hair and this brush stalled on my very first use of it. I basically took it from the box straight to the garbage.
4,Hair Rotostyler - Love it!,I did have the Revo for over 10 years and was unable to purchase another so I bought the Rotostyler and really like it a lot and it was a considerably cheaper. The only thing is you have to recharge it every 3-4 days where the Revo was always charging in it's stand. BUT I like the brushes for the Rotostyler better and it seems lighter. It is definately for short hair to maybe past your ears just above your shoulders. I have fairly short hair and I can see where longer hair may be a problem and get tangled. But I am really satisfied. I may buy a 2nd one to have on hand.
1,Terrible!!!,"Terrible!!! this is NOT a replacement for the revo-styler as advertised! Hair will tangle immediately. I won't even bother trying to return it, straight into the dustbin. As seen on TV are LIARS!!!"
4,Hair Rotostyler,"I did not like the brush the first few times I used it because it seemed to just pull and tangle my hair. You have to work with it and get used to its capabilities and then it's not too bad. It's not a Revo, but it does the job."
1,AWFUL ATENTION TO THE PUBLIC I STEAL DON'T KNOW WHERE ARE THE PRODUCTS,"AWFUL ATENTION TO THE PUBLIC I STEAL DON'T KNOW WHERE ARE THE PRODUCTS, THEY SAID THEY WHERE GOING TO RETURN MY MONEY BACK AND THEY DID NOT, WE ARE WAITING FOR WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN.WE DO NOT WANT THE ITEMS, WE WANT OUR MONEY BACK"
2,No narration or subtitles,"Photography is beautiful and the music is appropriate, but without any narration or subtitles, it is not a very useful DVD. I wish the product description had clearly stated this. It's just too cumbersome to have to read the enclosed booklet that describes what is being viewed."
4,Work as advertised,I was a little concerned that these would not stay on because it is such a light snap fit. The only time they have come off is in an automated car wash.
3,Maria Simma's accounts of the souls in purgatory,This book was informative. It was suprising to read that some souls do go directly to Heaven without any suffering in purgatory. I didn't like the illustration on the cover. I can't imagine the Blessed Virgin Mary every being so scantily dressed. It was offensive to see her depicted that way.The book was easy to read.
5,One of Depeche Mode's most intense songs!,"This is a great song! I first came across it by a co-worker of mine. I listened to it off of the ""Say Anything"" soundtrack and was completely hooked. The live version is so intense. I had so many emotions running through me and had to play it over and over again. A must listen to!"
1,Unusual disappointment for Ener-G,"I've tried several brands of gluten-free pizza crusts, I bought the Ener-G as my latest product exploration. Being a huge fan of many of Ener-G products, I thought this one would be a slam dunk hit. How wrong I was. The Ener-G pizza crusts are too thin, dense, and heavy, with very little taste. You would think ""thin"" and ""heavy"" would be contradictory, but that's what I really mean to say. By contrast, the Kinnikinnick pizza crusts are light and fluffy, with such an outstanding declicious flavor. I would strongly suggest buying a single package of the Ener-G pizza crusts from your local health food store first. I made a mistake trusting Ener-G on this product before I bought a whole case of it. It was an expensive lesson. But, nonetheless, a huge thanks to Amazon for offering so many gluten-free products. Here in the US, we are just starting to become familiar with how many people are affected by gluten."
4,Very Good,"Me and my brother have PKU, so we are on a low protein diet. We really liked these pizzas."
1,Ugly,I was very dissappointed in the color and quality of this shower curtain. The colors didn't look at all like the image shown. I thought it was very ugly.
5,Excellent Bio.,A very good history of women's aviation at the beginning. It also shows that Amelia was not all that she was marketed to be! The Bio. is very truthful in that way. Great old footage and interesting all the way.
5,Biography -Amelia Earhart,"This DVD fit into my DVD players,and I have been watching it many times.It was interesting story!I began to like Amelia Earhart when I saw a serie on TV with Women aventures on TV,and Amelia was special to me,and I loved it!Elisabeth"
4,I love books that include historical photos.,"In our house, we collect history/photographic books. This is a perfect addition to our collection. The text only enhances the understanding of a long ago era."
4,History done right,"I recently purchased ""Images of the San Juans"" to prepare for an upcoming trip I have planned for the area. This book does a great job of giving you a glimpse of life (and it was a rough life) the early minors and settlers had. One of the best features of the book is the uncanny ability of the author, P. David Smith, to bring out very subtle features found in these historical photographs. This just adds to the anticipation as you turn each page.The price of the book is quite high. The price and size of the book place it into the revered ""Coffee Table Book"" category. The only fault I find with the book is the binding and quality of the paper is lacking for a book in this category.If you enjoy understanding the history behind the places you visit and if you are planning trip to Southwestern Colorado (Durango, Telluride, Ridgeway, Ouray, or Silverton) then this book is a must read."
5,It's not that bad!,"Coming from the perspective of an only occasional D&D player, I find the information in this guide to be useful and fun. I don't immerse myself in this game the way some of my friends do, and so this gives me lots of good insights and ideas about how to play my rogue. I look forward to convincing my DM to allow me to choose some of the new feats and acquire the new equipment listed in this book."
1,A little to little,"I waited with anticipation for the release of this sourcebook, but was sorely dissapointed. The section on traps was interesting and is a section I will use, but thats about it. The Prestige Classes gave the impression of thrown together the night before, and the choices of discussions never went to the heart of the bard or the rogue. This product has put me on guard for further releases. Is third edtion heading the way of the 2nd edtion, lots of quanity, but zero quality? We will see."
4,Song and Silence:,"Song and silence is a great book. It provides with new feats, weapons and prestige classes which you can use to custumize your character. The best part about it is it teaches you how to use skills in a better way, and use your ability's to your advantage. the only thing that tips it off from being a 5-star is having no new skills when bards and rogues are the biggest skill user's in the game."
3,"Good for rogues, not so good for bards","This book would be somewhat useful to me if I was playing a rogue. Since I'm playing a bard, it wasn't really worth the money. One new prestige class for bards and a few new spells. Some of the content is useful, particularly the section on traps, but it's not indespensable material."
4,DnDFreak1's Review,"As the rouge is my favorite class, this book is a very good book to have when using rouges. You should buy this book if you are interested in rouge and bard pcs. Or for dms, you could use this to make an excellent adventure having to do with rouges and/or bards. So overall I think this is a very good book."
3,Take it or leave it...,"If you really want to play a rogue or a bard at an advanced level, you may want to buy this. Otherwise, you might just want to save your money.A few of the prestige classes are interesting. However, the majority of the new ones offered up -- as well as the quirky feats are just unecessary and bland. Even though I love playing rogues, I expected more from this one."
2,"More of a ""Guidebook for Rogues"" (oh yeah, and those bards)","I've only been playing D&D; for a little more than a year, and I've only played one character in the one ongoing campaign - and she's a bard. I rather like my bard, and I was really looking forward to the release of this book.The book was a major disappointment. It's largely written for rogues - not bards. There are a few nice new spells, but that's the only part I found useful. Of the ten prestige classes, nine are truly written for rogues. The tenth, Virtuoso, is for a bard, but it isn't terribly impressive. The instrument descriptions did very little for me.Hopefully some third party will come out with a better supplement for bards playing D&D; - and soon. They really couldn't do it any worse than WOTC did. This book (...) certainly wasn't worth the cover price."
2,Unimpressed,"After enjoying SWord and Fist and Tome and Blood, I was realy looking forward to the opportunities that this book would offer for my fighter/rogue. While the book does go into great detail on the art of trap-making (practically pointless and prohibitively expensive for my rpga campaign) and what different types of instruments are available for bards, the book does little to extend thecombat abilities of the rogue.This book may make an interesting supplement to a home campaign where you want skilled professionals (temple raiders, royal explorers and spymasters) but doesn't seem to hold much value for someone playing under rpga rules where a swordfight is much more likely than a locked chest, pickpocket opportunity, or a magical spider amulet that is the only way to access theneat (but unplayable) Fang of Llolth prestige class."
4,Best of the WoTC Expansion Book,"I own all of the WoTC expansion books and this one is the all around best. The other books are geared towards DM's, in that they create prestige classes which would make colorful NPC's. Song and Silence has a healthy selection of prestige classes that players would actually like to become. Futhermore, the feats are very well defined and thought out, and in some circumstances, improved (S&S redefines, for the better, some of the expansion feats in Sword and Fist)."
2,Song and Silence,"Well, I waited until I had all five class books before I wrote this review, so here goes.This is the worst of the five books. Most of the prestige classes are lacking in both flavor and playability. Of the nice ones, the two best only fit as player options in an evil campaign. Further, the only bard-specific prestige class can't adventure!Some of the feats are nice, but the whole thing has this second rate air about it.The rules for the garret are so convoluted that you are better off making your own. (A garret is a length of cord used to choke someone--an exotic weapon.)The segment on poisons is really good, but that's just one section of the whole book.All in all, unless you are intent on owning all of these books or really enjoy books about thieves, this one can be passed over."
2,Song and Silence - disappointing,"Song and Silence offers prestige classes for Bards and Rogues as well as a few new feats and skills. However, if falls very short of satisfying my taste or that of people I know. The prestige classes offer little in the way of imagination...and only one applies to bards.A few of the feats are useful, but you're better off flipping through the book and just remembering the useful ones. Also, I really enjoy bards, but there is too much space devoted instruments. There is also too much space devoted to thieves guilds. This could be interesting, but it is basically a rehash of stuff I've read about since dragon #40.All in all it's a cute read, but I wouldn't waste the money...it simply doesn't offer that much which is new or interesting. If, however, you feel the need to own all of the 'kit' books, be my guest..."
1,Save your money,"I've been waiting for this product for about eight months now, ever since it was announced. I was sort of using it as an excuse for not converting an existing 2e rogue into 3e. Having bought it and explored it carefully I'm afraid to say it's not exactly any good at all. Roughly 40% padding (with a rehash on 'how your character gets on with the rest of the party' for goodness sakes) this book falls down on both content and value. The prestige classes are useless, and the whole thing reads like it hasn't been proofread. This really has left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm returning it for a refund."
2,Traps,"Compared to the other guidebooks, this one definately falls short. The prestige classes are nothing spectacular, and the only truly redeming quiality was the section on traps. Furthermore, the book even failed to answer the argument pertaining to sneak attacks applying to attacks of opportunity. All in al the book was not a good buy."
3,Not a great book,"If you're playing a rogue/bard, you've probably seen this book before. It's got a few prestige classes for each class, and a bunch of random feats/equipment/skill tricks that you will want to bring into your game. This is by no means a must-have book, but it does have a lot of fluff and other interesting material to help inspire you.If you're willing to spend the extra money, Complete Scoundrel is a much better book, in my opinion. This book (as all books do) has some balance problems, so everything that comes out of here has to be run past the DM first.In total, this book is probably 110 pages of content, and as a player you'll use maybe a dozen of them.If you're buying this book as a gift, here are some things to know: This is a book for the 3rd edition of D&D.; It can be uses with both 3.0e and 3.5e, with some minor tweaking. This cannot be used for any other editions (newer or older). Check with the birthday boy (or girl) to make sure this is the book (s)he needs."
1,Nothing Like the First Season,"This second season is nothing like the first season. The entire plot line has changed - instead of doing cool, security jobs, most of the episodes focus on the inter-office relationships. Also, Dutch is gone and Melanie leaves after the second episode. So we're left with that Karen chick from Will & Grace. It's too bad, if they would have stayed with the original premise this show could have been great - however, it seems that in order to get a second season, they had to make some compromises - for the worst, in my opinion."
4,Good show but odd...,"I liked this show. It is nothing amazing but it is good and enjoyable. It is similiar to a show that was cancled two years ago. A matter a fact it is the show that was cancled 2 years ago but redone to be good. Same core characters, some of same actors, but a much more enjoyable story. Previous version was computer guy forced to work for them for some reason, being picked on as new guy, and having a serious romatic involvment with one of the other main characters.This appears to be different with the computer guy just another joe on the team. Focusing instead on the owner as a main character which is much better, as he makes the show. I somewhat liked it before, but think this is much better."
3,condition of the product when it arrived,"I love CSINY, but I only gave this three stars because when the product arrived, some of the CD's were rattling around loose in the case they were in and the first one was scratched. I didnt want to go to all the trouble of sending it back after I waited so long to get it."
5,Thanks,very good part of my collection. This will help me with the full collection so I may watch them anytime.
4,Good documentary,"Interesting documentary, Shelby explains (though more often it seems like defends) why he is drawn to the Appalachian poor to use as subject matter for his famous photos"
1,Lies!!,"This film and his book are all lies...I know some of these people who he photographed and he staged them and told them what to wear how to look etc...it is disgusting...these people did not know they were going to be made fun of and put on display...they thought he was just taking pics for his own personal collection. Yes, there are poor people here, but we are not dirty, uneducated, and lazy...we are a proud people who work hard for what we have...I can't believe he would do this to his own family!!"
2,Insulting to Kentucky Appalachia folks,"Unfortunately, I purchased this item with the hopes that it would be as historically interesting as some of the other books and dvd's I have purchased on this area. Sadly, I sent it as a gift to a dear friend who lives there and was shocked to see the reaction. They feel it is an insult to the Appalachia of today and just continues to portray an ugly picture to anyone who has not been to the area. Some 'holler' dwellers may be very poor and less educated than some of us but they are still family folks and loving ones. Are they any different from the very clannish New Englanders? Are not there areas in each and every state that could show areas of poor, uneducated folks? Modern Kentucky Appalachia has come a long way and I think folks need to see that and not the one portrayed in this book. My heart goes out to the poor folks that were exploited herein and from now on, I will preview things before accepting reviews from others."
5,Having the time of my life,"I bought my first harminca and The book Harmonica Americana about a year and a half ago,then 6 months ago, I finally got around to ordering the two cd's that go with the book. What a difference the cds made for me! My ability jumped by leaps and bounds after that. Just to be able to hear what the songs really should sound like made all the difference in the world. What a thrill it is to me to be able to make GOOD music anytime at all. I tape my practising and when I replay it and then can't tell my harp playing from his, sometimes, I just think -wow! I am in the early stages of bending and thanks to his lessons, am extremely grateful that I really can bend notes! Just need to perfect this skill. I am a 55 year old grandmother of 13, so if I can, you can too."
5,Never to old,"Hi Jon,For a long long time, I had been planning to learn how to play theharmonica. This past Christmas my wife bought me a set of Soul's Voiceharps and my son bought me your Harmonica Americana with CDs, the onlything better would be to have you here at the house. A few days ago I had a friend download and burn(I dont have a burner) your Chugging and Bending instructions. Man! you talk about getting you in the mood to play, I listen to them going to work, sure beats listening to Imus in the morning. I now chug as fast as real train, ok,,ok maybe like a 2 mile long train going up a 6 mile 20 degree incline, but one of these days I'm gonna crest that hill, and then it's downhill and the speed will pick up. I want to THANK YOU for helping me fullfill a dream that I've had since I was young pup living in Canada. I'M now 60 1/2 years old which again proves that you're always young enough to learn. Again I THANK YOU for the enjoyment that I get practicing.CordiallyMike Hebert"
5,The BEST beginner's harp book by far,"Thanks a million to Jon Gindick for 'Harmonica Americana'. Man, I got further on this harp in one week thanks to this book/CD than I've managed in the last ten years with countless others. So delighted was I with my progress, I ordered Gindick's 'Country & Blues Harmonica For The Absolute Beginner' video from Amazon, and surprised myself at the ease with which I am FINALLY wailing out a blues riff or two. I'm now eagerly awaiting the arrival of Gindick's 'Rock N Blues Harmonica' book/CD . . . Re-reading all of that, it looks like some kind of cheesy commercial, so usual disclaimers: I'm not affiliated with Jon in any way other than as a VERY satisfied customer. Gindick's da man! Harp on!"
2,Disappointed,"Just my luck that the song I wanted to play the most (Swing Low, Sweet Chariot) is printed with the vital note bends missing. Oh, the asterisk is there in the key, but nowhere to be seen in the notes. I wonder how many other songs are misprinted.I'll be sending this one back."
4,Interesting View of Soccer's Minor Leagues,"The book provides an interesting view of the lower levels of professional soccer in the US. Most of the time we can only read about the players who have ""made it."" This book shows the reality of the vast majority of players who haven't quite made it and probably never will. I don't think it's quite good enough a read to merit 5 stars, but I would definitely recommend it to any soccer junkie."
2,A bit disappointing,"At first you think that this book is going to give you insight into the stardard language as spoken in Britain, Australia, and so on. There is a lot on diversity but we never quite get to the practical side of things and it is all left a bit unclear. What I needed was a straightforward guide for my work, when I travel on business, so I avoid misunderstandings and get the language right when I talk. It would be really helpful if this author could write a book with a description of the standard language for each country and vocabulary lists for the most usual words. You could then look across. I am going to Australia, then I say this, I am going to Britain, then I say this, and so on."
1,Bendable,"Got this from a different store;Handle felt great - the tip that will hit rocks under the dirt from time to time is very cheap.The fork side keeps on bending, making it useless to work with.I do not recommend this tool if you work on anything else than soft dirt."
2,Make sure you order 2 if you want a PAIR,"Obviously I should have asked first but I searched bookendS and this came up so I ordered them. However, it is only 1 bookend which ends up being $30 with shipping for just one. Not such a great deal. I plan to return it. A simpler item description would have been nice. It looks to be good quality but does me no good to have only one."
5,Kitchen Kaboom,"These folks were not kidding when they designed this unit.My Wife uses ours in the kitchen, and the effect can be feltall over the house! The sound quality is on par with home stereounits costing much more. The subwoofer is a great feature that enhancesthe overall sound.With most players of this sort, the bass is seriously lacking, and you miss alot of the music.If you desire a unit that rocks,this is the one."
5,JVC BOOMBOX,"THE ULTIMATE COMPLIMENT FOR THIS BOOMBOX IS WHEN SOMEONE FAR OFF TELL'S YOU TO TURN IT DOWN!!! I WORK IN A FACTORY AND I WANTED SOMETHING TO COMPETE WITH THE NOISE. THIS RADIO DOES THE JOB! IF YOU GOT THE $$$ FOR THIS BOOMBOX, I FOR FOR ONE HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"
5,Exactly what I wanted,"I had an older KaBoom box, the first generation. It had a hard life and I replaced it with this one. I was very happy to see the KaBoom box on Amazon. The RV-NB1 is an awesome piece of equipment. You can add other sources through the connections, but I am totally happy with everything the way it comes out of the box. The MP3 capability (off of a CD) is one of the main features I looked for in this type of boom box. The sound quality is super! A little pricey, but you truly get what you pay for."
4,JVC RV-NB1 Kaboom Series Boombox,"The only reason I left out a star on this is it REALLY is heavy, and it would've been nice to have a carry handle on top. Otherwise it's great - even for the price. I love the mic input, which makes announcing at singing telegram type performance settings great - especially with a lapel wireless mic; I haven't used the guitar input yet, but it may make a coffee shop gig an easy setup, if the lapel mic works on both! I'm very pleased with this purchase."
3,Great product...but huge,Excellent product but very big and heavy. Not really something that you can bring anywhere. Lacks the monster sound that you'd expect from a JVC product this big.
5,Kaboom Box,I bought this boom box to play music in a gym. It is everything that I wanted and needed. The sound is clear and LOUD.
2,Forget About Clear FM Reception . . .,"I would love to write a 5 star review for this item, because when playing CDs, this unit is outstanding. I mostly intend to use this unit for playing CDs. Every once in a while, I like to play the FM radio. This unit has perhaps the worst radio I have ever heard, period. I live in a major metro area, and nothing comes in clear, not one station. Because having the option to occasionally play the FM is extremely important to me, I am giving this otherwise superlative unit two stars."
5,Stall/gate latch,This latch is working great in my barn. It springs out of the way so it doesn't stick out and threaten to catch a horse on its way through the door.
3,"Bittersweet Sugar a contender, but not a champion","While I would not say that Herb Boyd's biography of Ray Robinson is disappointing, it is not the definitive book on the life of the greatest boxer ever to live. That book has yet to be written. While Boyd effectively put to use the memoirs of Edna Mae Robinson he was privy to, he creates only a skeletal outline of America's sociopolitical climate, Ray's childhood, the specifics of his boxing instruction, and the psychology behind his ambition and drive to greatness.Instead of focusing on Robinson's ring exploits, the tone is one of complacency and preoccupation with outside events; Boyd's attempt to show Robinson's abusive and stubborn personality, while honourable, takes away from what should have been a focus on Ray's climactic rise to pound-for-pound glory. The story of Ray Robinson needs to be told with unbridled urgency, and although this book falls short of doing that, it is still a great read."
4,Book tailed off,"This was a good book on a great champion. We get to see Robinson grow up and become the master boxer and hear about his life over the years. The decline in boxing skills is discussed as is the infidelities, the spousal abuse and the financial failings.I would have liked to have had more information on the life post-retirement and have had more photos.All in all, I enjoyed the book."
2,"Disappointing, Superficial","Start with 5 starsTake off 1 star for a self-serving and completely erroneous foreward by Percy Sutton who takes credit for saving the Apollo Thetaer in Harlem. Fact is he ran the Apollo into the ground and if it were not for the NY Daily News exposing Sutton, there would be no Apollo theater. You can look it up.Take off another 1-1/2 stars for a very odd comment in the epilogue. Boyd talks all through the book that Robinson was violent towards family members, especially his wife Edna. But in the epiologue, Boyd says ""there are the reports of his abuse of the women in his life."" Huh?? Did Robinson beat Edna or are these just ""reports"".Take off another star as the feeling you get at the end that this is a very superficial book. You have no idea of what makes him and Edna tick."
4,over-matched with Mrs.,very well written. disappointed to learn he punched his wife from time to time
4,It has been a good computer,"I bought this computer about a year ago and like one of the previous owners, I had a problem with it shutting down for no reason. I found after sending it out to get serviced that the CPU fan went bad and when it overheated, it shut down. I like the keyboard feel and the display is good in comparision to my older Toshiba laptop. I wish that it had more USB ports and expansion, but the ability to load it up with 2 gig of ram is a plus. The battery life is good too."
4,Great value for your money,"This is my first laptop,i have no major complaints.Performance is great, not really the best deal if you`re an avid gamer, the shared video memory doesnt isnt really too powerful, but most games do run.This laptop is loaded with the 60gb hd,512mb of ram and cd burner/dvd rom, although it could hav an additonal usb port or 2. Cooling is very efficient,doesnt get as hot as a lot of other laptops as long as air flow is unrestricted. It is a bit heavy but still comparable to other laptops with the same features.The display is great,cant ask for much more with the 15"" TFT.This is a great product and provides good value for your money, at this price,there isnt much more u can ask for."
4,Working Fine for my son,"I purchased the A35-S159 as a replacement for my son's desktop that failed. This notebook fit the bill. As a notebook, it takes so much less space and less noisy than his previous desktop computer. Conductivity was ""okay"". It took me about a day to get the Toshiba recongnized by my network (why???) and I'm not sure what I did to get it to work. The wireless was confusing as I was using 128 bit encyrption but the Toshiba would not allow me to input the 25 character WEP, so I had to change my other 2 wireless laptops to 64 bit so that the Toshiba would work.Other than what I descibed above, the system is perfect for my son's needs. He enjoys the large flat screen."
3,Adequate but generic.,"The book, though adequately printed and bound, was generic enough to resemble a self-published book from a ""vanity press"". This consideration would only be important to someone intent on possessing a permanent library."
4,REVIEW OF CH PRO PEDALS USB,THE UNIT ARRIVED IN GOOD SHAPE AND FUNCTIONAL. IT WAS RECOGNIZED BY WINDOWS XP HOME ADDITION WITHOUT MODIFICATION AND REQUIRED NO CALIBRATION. THE ONLY RESERVATION I HAD WITH THE UNIT IS THE ENCLOSED CD THAT HAD NO INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE.
3,CH Pedals- not enough resistance and brakes are too sensitive,"Setup of the pedals in Flight Simulator X was a snap. No issues whatsoever.My biggest complaint is that resistance is not adjustable on these pedals and they do not give a realistic yaw control feel whatsoever.They move way too easily. Furthermore the toe brakes are even worse when it comes to sensitivity, and even the slightest pressure on the front part of the pedal causes the brakes to be activated."
3,Pro Pedals,Pro pedals take some time to get after using Flight Sim Yoke in auto mode.The sensitivity can be reduced by changing the setting mode.Good purchase for tail dragger pilots.
4,A must purchase!,"If you are learning to fly and are using a flight sim to assist, these rudder pedals are a must! They are very sturdy and work fantastic. They might be a bit sensitive, but the realism they provide is worth it. This is a must have item! I also recommend getting the flight yoke from CH as well!"
4,Good choice for home use,"Used with MS FSX these work pretty well. Getting them configured and calibrated is simple and quick. Even has ""toe brakes"" to give you braking ability. Only down side is the weight. Unit will shift around over time."
2,Doesn't reset to center,"I've had this for about 3 weeks, and am not impressed. The pedals always think one or both brakes are pressed, even when I take my foot off the pedals entirely. Even if I adjust the sensitivity down to the point where I lose almost all responsiveness, it still seems to randomly hit the brakes or the rudder without me asking it to.I also don't find the pedals that comfortable. But that could just be me, since I haven't seen any other complaints."
4,"Works great, needs tweaking","It's a great product, however for Vista you need to visit CH Products and download their latest Vista drivers. The drivers (as of writing) do not like Vista's sleep mode, it tends to disconnect the pedals (and yoke) and still think they're hooked up. Which of course leads to some confusions. Easily fixed by changing the ""power switch"" in the start menu to actual shut down instead of sleep."
5,Realism,"If you want realism, you can't get enough from just a joystick. These pedals are not just ordinary pedals. You will be amazed when you use these for flight simulator. They help me make those long banks, and now I can even taxi successfully onto the runway. The brake feature only makes these pedals better. When I first plugged the pedals into my computer, they were installed right away! If you like flight simulator, don't leave an experience like this behind you."
5,"Great deal, great product","I was very pleased with my purchase from price, shipping to product, everything was perfect. Thank you and God bless."
4,Nice product,Hook-up is easy. I just had to plug into USB and my computer read the product immediatley and it was ready to use.
1,Save your money!,"This is a cool idea, but the execution just isn't there for flight simulation. Unlike the CH Products Yoke - which is really very good - there is very little that feels like real rudder pedals in an airplane. Control inputs tend to overact, sending you all over the sky, and you start spending your time trying to manage the pedals, not the simulator. As much as I'd like to have rudder pedals in my simulator setup, it just isn't worth the trouble. Most sims don't effectively emulate the precession and torque of a single engine prop anyway, so why bother?"
5,CH Pro Pedals,"My CH Pro Pedals have worked great, with no problems. They definately make flying aircraft more realistic on flight simulators."
4,Flight Simulator,We use this product at our museum's Aviation Learning Center. It performs well and easy for students to use.
3,"Nice construction, poor customer support","Using these pedals with FS2004, I found that the rudder controls work quite nicely but the toebrakes are just too sensitive. CH Products has some software that will moderate pedal movement to soften the touchiness, but their customer service is very unprofessional, almost as if an 8 year old is telling you what to do. Given the FS2004 market, I'd guess that CH Products would take this issue more seriously."
5,Can't Fly Without Them!,Excellent product for giving the smooth feel and control in computer flying simulation.Installs easily and works great.
5,These pedals are great!,"I am using the pedals for rudder control in the Microsoft FSX flight simulator and the Condor Soaring Simulator. Installation with Windows XP Pro could not be easier. Just plug into the USB port and you are ready to go. Calibration was automatic and perfect.Performance of the pedals was great. I am a pilot, and the pedals perform in a very realistic way. The tow brakes work well when taxiing.These pedals are well worth the reasonable price."
4,Good but not amazing...,Easy to set up and use. They do have a cheap-spring feel and i don't think they're worth the price (I paid around $100 USD) but combined with the CH Products yoke they complete the flying experience really well.Note: The pedals are rather light and don't grip onto carpets (work best on a hardwood floor)...Overall a good product.
4,Works well enough,"The pedals are nice in that you don't have to install a lot of drivers and they are pretty simple. The simplicity is a downfall as well in that they feel much like a toy. I purchased these to help fly flight simulators to prepare for the real thing, and these don't feel the same. The resistance is far less, and the way they sit with your feet aren't the most realistic compared to real rudder pedals.For the price, I'd expect a better effort."
3,Disappointed,I was sent a DVD instead of a cd. I did not want a DVD! I ordered a cd because I do not use my DVD player.
3,good movie,"They successfully created a spooky environment in this movie which I think very new to Hindi movies. I liked the professor concept also. They successfully make this character believable also. And they made a good balance between the love and horror. The direction, editing, sound and camera is great. I jumped a lot times in my chair during this movie."
5,A must-must read if you're serious about Central Park.,"""The Park and the People"" is an exquisite work of scholarship. I've read much about the park but nothing approaches the depth of knowledge and insight contained in this extraordinary book. It's provocative, exciting, extremely well written, and downright readable. I learned something new on every page and simply could not put it down."
5,You will love the Park even more...,"...when you fully understand its complex and rich history!This exhaustively researched, compellingly written history of NYC's magnificent Central Park is the ultimate landscape biography. It reads almost like a mini-series!As a New Yorker (who even gives guided Running Tours of the Park) who treasures our communal ""back yard,"" I was especially fascinated to learn the tumultuous stories of the familiar landmarks in and around the Park. It should be mandatory reading for any Manhattanite. Admirers and/or detractors of the Park will want to better inform themselves with this amazingly relevant read.A treasure trove of information about this famous and infamous piece of American history.PS-Don't overlook Riverside Park, either!"
5,One of DM's best.,"This is one of DM's coolest, best songs. It's really amazing but it gets less props 'cause it was never on an alblum, only released as a single and then put on the greatest hits. A must have."
4,Great paddle for the price,"Just got my new Rogue river paddle delivered and im very happy with the overall quality. It appears to be very well built with quality componets. Also the built in ruler and cushioned grip are nice features that you wont find on another paddle of the same price. Overall im very happy with the paddle, its not the best paddle money can buy but for the price it cant be beat."
5,Seem to be good quality.,I bought two of these for back-up on my ski boat. Haven't had the opportuniy to use them much (thank the lord) but they to be very good quality and long so I can paddle high up on my boat.
2,"""FRAGILE"" sticker placed on the paddle.","I ordered two of these paddles. I've received them. They look pretty good, but whoever packed it put a sticker that says FRAGILE on the shaft of the paddle. The sticker's a huge PITA to remove. I'll have to use solvents to get it off the aluminum. The paddle was also wrapped in bubble wrap which protected it well, but hid (and thus defeated) the sticker.Nice product, it seems. But knuckle-headed packaging. Don't put shipping/packing decals directly onto the product."
5,"Naughty and rounchy, just the way I like it...","If you like reggaeton and mamasitas that you have to have this DVD.They like to please themselves and one another using whatever falls in their hands. This DVD features 7 curvy beauties as they dancing, stripping and strutting their tight bodies straight to the camera. They are hot and not shy a bit!!!Great music, nice editing and delicious mamasitas!"
3,Not Bad,Has a good lesbian scene but it has an annoying graphic style interposed that is too distracting.
5,informative,I never thought of the life of an adult film star could be so lonely. She is a awesome lady.
5,Reality 10 Years Later,"La Haine is a subtitled, fantastic, well shot, Black & White French film about how France gives lip service to diversity. The day I write this it is the 11th day of rioting in Paris suburbs, November, 2005. La Haine has come to life 10 years later. In comparison to American cinema, this is the disaster movie that never happened; i.e. ""Over the Edge"", ""Red Dawn"", ""Escape From New York"". The difference between the US & France was the US realized the direction things were going and did something about it. France didn't and now it burns.La Haine will illustrate reality- the hate, the racism, the poverty in harsh terms.DO NOT SHOW THIS MOVIE TO YOUNG CHILDREN!!! Issues are too complex."
3,Second half a pleasure!,"The first half of the album is from the early years, more old country western which I did not care for. From song #11 through the end was when Eddy Arnold was transitioning over to a more modern style. So in brief, I skip thru the first 10 songs to get to what I enjoy."
3,"Ok, but not great","I have an Eddy Arnold record that I liked very much (Eddy Arnold Sings them Again). But these versions of some of the same songs,I don't know quite how to say it,were too country(ish). On the record that I have, he sings the songs more contemporary. I wore out the first one and bought a used one in good condition. I had the first Lp for 40 years. Yes, I am old."
2,Not what I expected,"When I ordered this piece I thought it would be the same as an old record album that I have. Although the songs were the same, on my old album, they had a much more updated sound and a greater ""depth"" to it as well"
2,Cool Toy but broke on the first day,"I was surprised when I got the item ( I was hoping to hide it for a christmas gift but the box was huge and it came in the orginal box so my kids could see the game coming off the ups truck). The game looked better in person and what was great was my 3 year old and 7 year old both were playing and having fun. One horse, the yellow one never work. My husband tried to fix it without luck, the spring mechanism was broke from the start. My kids still could play with the oher three horses but within the first night, the other three horses broke off. This could have been a great family toy. I only paid 5.29 with free shipping but I am still disappointed espcially with no response from amazon customer service."
5,Growed and Ate One Yesterday!,"This is like the best organic cucumber ever! Grew in 2 months and 5 seeds grow 20+ cucumbers! Fresh and Healthy, I totally recommend this product!"
3,did not sprout,These seeds did not even sprout. I was really hoping for some good cucumbers this year. Will not purchase again.
5,Very good,100 % germination very impressed with the seed quality. Required minimum effort and the plants came out in about 5-6 days.
2,"Ferry-Morse, what gives?","I had a lot of trouble growing these seeds and, as of the date of this review, have not had one plant survive to maturity, let alone more than two weeks. I am also growing Armenian and lemon cucumbers, and, despite being grown in the exact same conditions (sterile seed starter, peat pots), the Straight Eights were inarguably the losers of the bunch. I tried growing them on three separate occasions (this generous pack comes with ~100 seeds), and each time the seedlings would succumb to damping off and die as miserable, limp little heaps. I really, really just don't get what I've been doing wrong. Even my Mexican Miniature Watermelon/Sour Gherkin plants did better than this, and they were left unwatered for about four days. I just have a feeling that the seed stock for this isn't as healthy as it could be. Straight Eight is well known for its reliability and production, but, based on this experience, I can safely say that I cannot vouch for either."
3,still waiting,It's been over a week and the package STILL has not shipped.Will change my rating once it actually gets here..
3,wish the limbs moved..........,"Hi,Another goodie. My [...] grandson LOVES THOMAS THE TRAIN and everything associated with it. He loved this conductor and Sir Topham Hat, but broke them almost immediately cause he wanted the arms and legs to bend. My son fixed them with crazy glue......and so far, they held up.sorry.......vicky f"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IS NOT A PORTALEDGE LIKE DESCRIPTION SAYS!!!,Do not buy this from moosejaw.com. the item description is for a ledge. the price is for a ledge. the image is for the fly. you will receive the fly in the mail rather than the ledge. this is also overpriced for just a fly so dont buy it.
1,Memory card,"Got this memory card for my PSP, I have 3 memory card/sticks 1 GB, 2GB, and a 4GB they all work like they should. You may need an adapter for some readers to access the memory, wich it came with but I mis-placed some where. You can still you it without an adapter, but getting it out will be tricky using tweezers."
4,Pretty good.,"A good collection, but not great. A lot of the early unreleased songs were later chopped up for the real LP material. So a skynyrd fan has heard most of it before in another form. The live stuff is good but scripted to sound just like the studio versions-not overly exciting. The performances and outtakes are top notch southern rock though. Best track on the CD is ""Woman of Mine."""
5,"This is a Great Double Disc Cd Package, for Hardcore Skynyrd Fans!!!","This includes some great ""vintage"", songs from the ""original"" Lynyrd Skynyrd Band. It contains songs from 1968, through their pre-plane crash, glory days, live at the Fox Theater in Altanta. It contains some rarites, plus some of their greatest hits. It includes songs recorded, on radio programs, in studios, and live at the Fox, in Atlanta. This double cd brings back some great memories."
2,Decent but strange aftertaste,I used this for three weeks but didn't see any changes in tooth brightness. Also the flavor was unappealing. Switching back to Crest.
4,Soothing,This is very soothing for intense dryness and seems to do the job. The only thing I don't really like is how thick it is and difficult to spread or wipe off.
5,"Good stuff, made in USA","Have been using it since baby's birth. Never needed anything else. No complaints. Very good product and it's made in USA!Charming name, very to the point.Full 5 stars from me."
2,Defective product,"Maybe it was just the one I ordered, but all cds skipped when being played, so I had to return it."
2,Didn't expect much and still disappointed,"I bought this player for my kitchen and really only needed it for the basic functions of playing cds and fm radio. I have had it for only one week and I'm disappointed. This player refuses to play two brand new, right out of the wrapper cds. And I know it's the player because I've tested both cds in two other stereos around my house. Another disappointment is that any little vibration causes cds to skip. I have it on the kitchen counter and if a fork is dropped in the sink, there goes my smooth listening. On the positive side, the sound is good for the small space I'm using it in and I actually get better reception from this player than my other more expensive digital ones."
1,Unbelievably bad.,"I didn't think it was possible to screw up a CD player/radio so badly. The radio is entirely an afterthought. There's no way to see what radio station you're tuned to! I expected the front panel LCD to show what station I'm tuned to, but it stays blank with the radio on. The sound quality is very weak and bad; there's a persistent hiss. Even with the volume turned all the way up, it's weak - you'd think you could get more out of the speakers. The antenna is pathetic - fully extended, it's only 9.5 inches. The lid for the CD player doesn't pop up high enough; it wouldn't take long before it gets broken. I don't think I've ever kept anything with the name ""Coby"" on it - I'm returning this immediately and in the future I'll never consider another Coby product."
3,Product is OK for the price,Product is ok for the price we pay. Sound is good. if it had remote that would be good. There is no shuffle option.it plays songs in serial mode that's a disadvantage
2,No AM/FM Radio read-out!,How can one use a radio without an digital read-out letting one know what station is being tuned in? I guess this product is really for those who only want a portable CD player.
1,Stopped Functioning after one month,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, and the unit stopped functioning after about a month. The CD stopped playing (or even spinning) and the AUX wouldn't even work. It was almost as if the unit wasn't getting power. Fortunately, Amazon gave us a full refund."
4,small and handy boombox,"Low cost and very handy.At first, it did not play my MP3 CD. Later, I found that I had to burn the Disc at SLOW speed in order to play the MP3 CD in it."
2,Claimed to have digital turner and did not! Retunred to sender,"As noted in title says, it claimed to have a digital turner and did not. In addition radio sounded tinny and did not hold a station well"
2,Not what i expected,"I use for MP3 playing only, volume not adequate, plays MP3 disc then cuts off in the middle of the disc.I was hoping for a machine i could play my MP3 and i did not receive my hopes."
1,"Waste of money, piece of garbage","I purchased two of these ""on sale"" for $20.00. We have had them for approximately 6 weeks. BOTH of them, within a few days of each other, completely quit working. The CD mechanism will not spin or work. These are worthless pieces of garbage, not worth a cent."
4,Coby MP-CD455 Portable MP3/CD Player,"I was pleasantly surprised at the performance of this little portable MP3/CD ""boombox"". For such a low price it plays well and sounds good."
3,TRACK LISTING,1. Go Go Dancer (Radio Edit) 4:282. Go Go Dancer (12'' Mix) 6:003. Go Go Dancer (The Dub) 5:524. Go Go Dancer (Factory Mix) 6:005. Go Go Dancer (Dub Dub Dancer) 6:006. Go Go Dancer (Royal Mix) 6:02
3,Satisfied,Everything came to our home in very good shape and on a very nice timely basis. I will order again from Amazon and feel very comfortable doing so.
5,Incredible!,I was a big diet coke drinker until I saw this documentary! They do a very thorough job of uncovering the timeline and key people involved in the FDA's approval of aspartame... can you believe that Donald Rumsfeld was the president of the company that manufactures asparatame when it finally got FDA approval!!! Lots of political information and background. I highly recommend this!!!
1,Simply wrong.,"[...]The movie simply fails to make it's case, and ignores the overwhelming evidence that Aspartame is in face save. Made by a group of people who are also pushing the anti-vaccine agenda, they appear grossly ignorant. I can only hope the people who watched this and thought it ""opened their mind"" do even a little research in their own."
2,Overrated,"First off, this CD really isn't that good......Cotton Hell, you can't even compare these guys to Silverstein or Hawthorne Heights, those bands are so much better its not even funny. Go complain about bands and write negative reviews that make sense you idiot. Go listen to Korn and Slipknot and Fear Factory and all those crappy metal bands whose members are 30+ years old and still sing about how the world sucks and people are mean to them - that music is weak and for pathetic losers such as yourself."
5,Best Steely Dan Compilatation Ever!,A very generous 33 track collection compiled by the masters themselves Donald Fagen and Walter Becker. All tracks have been remastered by the original engineer Roger Nichols and sound amazing. This compilation has the two tracks not on any other Steely Dan LP FM (from the fm soundtrack) and Here at the Western World (previously only available on the Greatest Hits and Citizen Steely Dan box set).A difinite must for all Steely Dan Fans!
2,Greed personified,"I think the only way to be a Steely Dan fan is to be a completist. I think most fans are and I think most fans have all their records. With a CD-Recorder, I can make this compilation on my own, so why would I pay good money for it? And I'm beginning to suspect Becker and Fagen are not without blame when it comes to greed."
5,Jazz-Rock Pioneers Early Best,"...Two solid Discs, full of classics. A lot more simple than the 4 disc bulky brood, and a little more peppier than the 14 track sampler. I am more drawn to disc II simply because of songs like the funky Black Cow or the sexy Peg. This doesnt mean I dont like the other disc. There are the standard faves there. I liked the newer old stuff better is all. I love when they get the black background vocalists in and make them a little less white. Not that i dont love that...OK a little to much critical nonsense and not enough praise. Check this CD out when you either want to enjoy enough of the old days, or are discovering this for the first time. I made friends in my drivers ed. class because of this CD...and that was just one year ago. This duo really are a conversation piece! Enjoy, and listen without predjudice, and be prepared to laugh. There is also a particularly witty Essay about a man who supposedly stole the AJA masters, thats quite amusing."
3,hot happy,"I just recived my dvd from amazon. I was very excited, but when I opened the package my dvd is all scratched up. I am not very pleased considering I am a seroius MJ collector."
3,Just a collage of the same type of thing....,"I have or have at least viewed almost every MJ dvd/video out there. I purchased this one because there isn't much out there of him winning any awards. Although it was nice to see him win and watch him in those moments, the editing on this dvd is poor. They cut clips out and splice together the ceremonies and they are all out of order datewise. I wouldn't recommend this dvd unless you are a die hard fan and want to see everything there is. It was just ok in my book. But then - anything with MJ is at least ok."
2,mj dvds,"Sorry, but I was very unhappy with this dvd. You can tell that it was badly made.It was alright to see some footage from years ago but the quality was poor. Should have saved my money on something better."
1,michael jackson the Awards Collection,"Not sure why the rest of the reviews are speaking so highly about the Michael Jackson Awards Collections. Because that's exactly what this DVD is a collection of M.J's receiving awards throughout his career on stage.Not so much fun for a real M.J, fan who enjoys his performances not so much his speeches."
3,What Is This?,"Without a detailed description of this product, there is no way I would purchase it. How do we know it's not just another substandard cash-in on Michael Jackson's name and fame, God rest His soul."
3,It was okay..Not too thrilled,"Well..I was not too excited about the quality of the disc, but it is always good to see Michael Jackson again..I miss him..this world is Strange without him..I love michael..I just wish the quality of this DVD was as exciting as he was. All this time Michael Jackson was innocent & he stood for truth.Now we are stuck with people who can't even sing & a bunch of I guess semi wannabes.. here's to my friend Michael Jackson(The original Classic & more)."
3,OK read; better for kids,"Not really what I expected or hoped for. The poems are short, easily read, but not the deep imagery and emotion I would expect from a book for adults. Recommend for kids who are horse-crazy."
2,"A valiant effort, but...","It's difficult to really rate this book. As a general history of submarines in combat it covers the subject, and the author has a nice style that makes for a generally good read. On the other hand, there are so many factual errors that the rating is dragged right down. At one point HMS Royal Oak is confused with HMS Ark Royal, at another the crew of the Dutch O-19 is reported as being rescued by USS Shad (it was actually USS Cod). American submarine captain Frank Latta is repeatedly called ""Latte,"" the sort of error frequently prompted by too heavy reliance on a spell checker. And, of course, USS Nautilus, while being the first nuclear sub, was not a Polaris missile sub. That said, none of the errors are of the sort that couldn't be easily fixed, so if there is a subsequent edition that corrects them, I'd happily move the rating up the scale."
3,Depeche mode suprise with a Mozart Cover 3 and a half star,well Little 15 is not my favort DM songs still it is dark and enjoyble in my own edition of Little 15 there is 3 Tracks. my most favorit song in this cd is the Sonata no 14 it is the only Mozart song that i have and the way that alan Wilder Play it its just Wonderfull
3,"Better than Budokai 1, but not 5 stars","Ok i'll start with the good. There are now many more characters, the graphics have been improved a little (i kinda enjoyed Budokai 1's), there are more attacks, new stages and a new health bar that extends to a max of 7 life bars.Now, the bad. The same problems as Budokai 1. Everyone has the same attacks. Kamehameha and Galick Gun are exactly the same except for a different graphic. The crappy computer in the earlier levels makes it Lv 1-easy lv 5-easy lv 8-easy lv 9-VERY HARD. And another problem. In Budokai 1, Cell's default form was his 1st form (with the most annoying voice). In B. 2, he starts and stays in his perfect form, yet he keeps the ugly first form voice and still loses power from being perfect (same with Freeza)."
5,tote dog,"honestly, I dont own dis game. BUT me amd my pals played and it rocks like dingos. I'll admit at first I wasnt Really thinking ""awesome"" because I had never heard of dbz. but, this game [ along with B. 1] helped me become a fan"
5,Better than expected,Since i got dbz sagas first frommistermoney-hq. And sagas didn't work i though budokai 2 wouldn't work but when i got it had no scratches it was flawless. There was no glitches or anything that runied the game it was fun i got to play nd beat it with out distractions. Even though 1 game from mistermoney-hq didn't work it doesn't mean all of it's game doesn't work too.
3,It gives you a thrill,"That is however for only 30min. The game play was fast, but no different then the first I hate the board. Anyways I hope the bring Budokai 3 to Gamecube they already gave it 1 and 2. We need to protest to Atari they take e-mail to. When first played that game I got addicted and I love the dragon mode. I also heard that ps2 is hetting another new dragonBall Z budokai game coming out later around Christmas. I know some of you already have a ps2. I just don't wanna waste any more money on a another new system."
3,Okay workout for most pregnant women,"Being a long-time regular fitness/workout fan but with little time, I found this tape both during my first and second pregnancy a good help, especially for the persistent backache. The 30-minute time frame is just right. It is not particularly challenging, but then again it is not too saltless- if you put some energy into it it leaves you feeling you've done an adequate regular workout. The music is a bad choice, but then again I usually just turn the volume down and chat right over it. I would buy another pregnancy workout by Denise Austin if it became available."
3,Upbeat To Annoying,"This was the 1st video I bought to stay in shape during my pregnancy because it is too cold to exercise outside.While the workout is fun, it is way too short. Just when I get going, it is time to lay down and ""relax"". Denise looks like a deer caught in headlights and her helpers seem annoyed by her as well. They are both very pregnant which made me feel good though. I use this video on my low energy days only. For kicks, I have my husband do it with me, that really cheers me up(he is not good at aerobics!)."
1,No thanks!,"I found Denise Austin to be insipid and very unclear in her cues for the moves. Furthermore, I suffered a terrible backache after completing this video workout! I prefer the Buns of Steel pregnancy workout. Check it out!"
1,horrible,"this woman has no business being on a video, she is so annoying and goofy, its absolutely pathetically horrible, dont bother buying this video, try fitmama or something else"
5,THE pregnancy work out,"This is the ultimate. I developed gestational diabetes with both my pregnancies, and this video helped me control my blood sugar without having to go on insulin. It is so nice that Denise is pregnant at the same time. I did not wind up puffy in my legs/feet, face, or elsewhere. Even though I was doing it every day, I never got bored. In fact, I looked forward to seeing Denise every day. I would recommend this for any one. She is easy to follow, and offers informative medical information i.e. interview with an MD, info about pulse rate, etc. The only depressing thing is in the post-baby work out. She and the other two women looked like they had never had a baby, it was a real let down when I didn't look like that four weeks post-partum! All in all, though, GET THIS VIDEO!"
3,Good but old,"This tape was good but it is old. The moves were really good and kept me entertained for 30 min. but the music could be better. I paid only a couple bucks so I felt like I got what I paid for, but not too disappointed. I was on 10 weeks of bedrest and wanted to get back into shape after being an avid exerciser. Overall, I thought it was good."
3,Good toning; cardio section isn't great,"The cardio portion of the tape was too easy (and I wasn't in great shape to begin with), it was interrupted by notes on form and posture that were disruptive after the first time through, and the cool down was inadequate -- I had to pause the tape and walk around before the toning section. The toning segment, however, was very effective. The ""you can do it!"" comments wore thin very quickly, particularly when we were only marching."
1,Not a very good workout,I worked out regularly before my pregnancy so I am in relatively good shape. I didn't think this video was very challenging at all. I get a better workout by going on a 30 mintue walk. I also didn't like the music. If you work out regularly I recommend purchasing another video.
3,irritating but effective,"This video used to be the only one available for pregnant people. I have used it for three pregnancies, including my current one which is a twin pregnancy. The music is elevator Glori Estefan. Denise is a little too perky for the hormonal, the moves are dated and the costumes are ridiculous. That being said, it's great for begining exercisers or off days for those who are too tired for anything more intense. There are some weak toning exercises for the core and lower body after the 20 minute cardio segment. You could always put it on mute and listen to better music!"
3,An Okay Workout,"I purchased this when I first found out I was pregnant with my second child. I used it once and put it away. There was no challenge. If you are used to working out on a regular basis before pregnancy then you will want something more intense than this workout. I continued to do cardio-boxing and Denise's Blast Away 10 Pounds throughout most of my pregnancy. Now that I'm 8 months pregnant I find the Pregnancy Plus Workout beneficial. Its good if you are not used to exercising but, like I said, if you are used to working out you'll need something much more than this in the beginning. The other problem with the video is that she interrupts the workout three times to explain how to do a specific exercise. I wish they would have explained all that at the beginning of the workout. Its annoying to be interrupted every time when, if you've watched the tape once, you already know how to do the exercise."
4,Nice way to squeeze in half an hour of exercise,"The workout is the perfect length to squeeze in before work or whenever you can spare 30 minutes. It makes it more likely you will exercise 3 or more times a week. It is designed for pregnant women, so there is no need to worry about doing the ""right"" kind of exercises. I had originally thought it was too easy, but when I took my pulse found it was up to 140 bpm, which is max for pregnancy workouts, so if I had been exercising on my own, I probably would have overdone it! The 30 minutes includes warm-up, low-impact aerobics and relaxation. Denise is a tad too perky and can get annoying, so after learning the routine, I turn down the volume."
4,Perfect for third trimester,"Though I've never been a Denise Austin fan I needed a workout that was tailored to the pregnant woman when I entered my third trimester. At first I didn't think this scaled back version of exercise was going to be enough to keep me in shape, but I've found that if I just put a little extra energy into each of the moves I'll get my heart rate up and my body will feel so much better afterwards. A note of caution: If you are easily annoyed by the color pink and perky pregnant people you will have a hard time with this video!! Overall I think this video is great for the last trimester when you have to slow down a bit but you want to keep moving. And the fact that it has the recommendation of the American College of OB/GYN gives me a sense of security knowing that the moves I'm doing are safe for the baby."
3,Great Workout for Third Trimester,"I bought this video when I was four months pregnant (for [$$] at a local video store, this is a lot better deal). It was too easy and I didn't feel like I was getting much of a workout. I started using it when I got to my third trimester and it was perfect. The exercises are very easy to follow and any amount of exercise in your thrid trimester will make you feel better. I was in pretty good shape before my pregnancy and exercised when I could during my pregnancy. I just had my baby two weeks ago and tried the post-pregnancy workout portion of the video. I found it too simple. Women who were not in shape before pregnancy might like it."
3,Not if you're familiar with aerobics,"This tape is ok for beginners (she takes time to explain proper positions, etc.) but I found it less than rewarding. Walking around while pumping your arms would have been as effective and cost much less!"
3,Could have been better,"This video would have been much better if it wasn't interrupted several times by instructional interludes that you really only need to see once. So what are you supposed to do when you're watching the instruction for the 10th time? I usually try to continue the exercise move, but it's still very annoying. Nevertheless, I like the aerobics sections (too easy in the beginning of my pregnancy, but worthwhile now that I'm almost 36weeks along), and I like the arm and leg toning that's incorporated into the aerobics section."
2,This must have been before Denise found her style...,"I am a HUGE Denise Austin fan. However, I found this video a little boring and monotonous, and most of the moves weren't especially helpful. It was great ""working out with Denise"" during pregnancy, but when I was actually in labor, I was wishing that I would have used a pre-natal yoga tape instead! It would have been nice to have already been accustomed to the deep breathing that is required to get through a natural birth. As I said before, I love Denise, but I just can't recommend this video to expectant moms."
3,Energizing,I enjoyed this video. I workouted with this video everyday of my pregnancy. I liked the upbeat tempo and it was easy enough to do on those tough days of pregnancy. However I did find that it was at times a little to easy. I found that I still struggled with putting on extra weight even though I worked out everyday. But for those people looking for a quick energizing workout this one is great.
2,How much do you like chipper?,"If you're not in great shape, like cheerleader chipperness, and don't pay close attention to beat count, this isn't a bad video. I found it just barely hard enough to be worthwhile doing the exercises while carrying my 30 lb toddler throughout! Also the constant cheerful encouragement got on my nerves very quickly. Last but not least, Denise is not consistent in her steps and counting, not fatally so, but another irritant. I used the video a few times, then found another because this one made me want to kick the TV."
1,Oracle Cards,"I bought these cards because I had an angel card reading and the person doing the reading suggested I get angel oracle cards. Yes, they are very beautiful but their ""message"" is quite vague. They haven't helped me with any area in my life since every time I ask a question I get an ""answer"" to a question that I haven't asked.A total waste of money."
2,not happpy,"these cards are not what i consider to be a large card deck. they are the same as all her other decks. i did not like the content of these csrds as much as the daily guidance ones. the daily ones are much better. i felt she just came up with these to sell more items to people who already had the other ones, it worked with me , but i would not recommend these at all.if possible i will be returning these cards."
4,Good Angel Cards...,"These cards are very nice, however I didn't find them to be as accurate as the Daily Guidence from Your Angels cards. These cards are great and easy to use and come with a cute little booklet that shows you how to use them. They have lovely pictures on each one, and are postive & uplifting. I reconmend them to use them in addition to other card packs."
1,Vague and Inaccurate.,"I had these for one month and while they are beautiful, they aren't very accurate and are better used for cheering ones self up than giving a accurate reading to your self or anyone else.I have been a tarot reader for over 5 years now and I found that the regular Ride Waite deck is way more accurate and realistic for answers than Doreen's angel deck. Most of the time when I did a pull, I got cards with messages that did not even correspond to the issue or question properly at all. When the cards sort of correspond with my question, they were highly vague and didn't give a full spectrum of view and insight to work with, it was very vague and lacking guidance. These cards feel more like they should be used for people who want to be encouraged and inspired, but not if your looking for serious accurate answers. This deck is not for me."
5,Where would we be without our Angels?,"Short and sweet - they are inspiring, thought provoking, and never wrong. The cards themselves are a work of art and a pleasure to gaze upon the beautiful angels. Just holding the cards in your hands emits a wonderful energy."
2,Not for me...,"The images are not that pretty and the quality of the desk is not the best. I would not mind that, but on top of that it really does not work for me, messages do not come easy. Overall not an oracle for me."
5,MESSAGES FROM YOUR ANGELS,"This deck of Angel card are excellant! Doreen Virtue my friends and i had a blast with them this weekend.Doreen I love your books,cds,oracle cards(I LOVE YOU). I WISH YOU LIVED IN NY. I WANT TO MEET YOU. Your work is bring wonderful things to this earth and i appreciate all your hard and successful work. MY WISH IS TO MEET YOU, IT WOULD BE A GREAT HONER. I WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO ACHIEVE THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE. I WOULD TELL PEOPLE WHO BUY YOUR CARDS TO KEEP DOING READINGS AND PAY ATTENTION TO THE CARDS.I HAVE FOUND THEM TO BE VERY GOOD AND MEANINGFUL ANSWERS TO MY QUESTIONS.THANK YOU DOREEN VIRTUEMARIA FROM NY"
4,The vacation from hades,"I kind of feel sorry for Zoey. So far, none of her ideas have really panned out. The party ended in disaster and this vacation is turmoil. Well, except for Aisha running into christopher. Claire and Benjamin are mad foul. I have not really been crazy about Claire from the beginning; however, I really don't like her now. She has no right to ruin her fathers life, because someone else complicated hers. She needs to take it out on Aaron not her father and Sarah.I really hope to see Jake and Kate hook up. I really am starting to like Jake. As for Lara, I have absolutely nothing to say about Lara. She doesn't deserve any pity. She has no common respect for other people. Quite frankly, I do not blame Jake for not wanting to be bothered with her. If she wants to continue messing up her life, then she has to do that by herself."
2,the most disappointing book of the series,"I have read several of the books in the making out series and this is the worst. In the past I was unable to put them down like with ""ben takes a chance"" but this is very slow. I am very sick of Ben being a jerkoff but worse I am sick of Nina being a push over. She should tell him to kiss off!! I think katherine applegate needs to find some new inspiration. I am hoping the next one is somewhat better!!"
4,"Hard grinding and literate, an overall bad-ass dance cd.","This is a very intelligently mixed cd. It brings home the old 6400 days of 1988, with tracks laid down in a wicked style. This cd is pure retero dance, bad-ass and very well constructed. Overall, its hard grinding and literate, a great dance cd for the retero lover."
4,Entertaining Shorts,"What can I say, this collection had ""The Car Kid"" with James Franco and Meat Loaf; this title alone was a hard find. The only problem with ""The Car Kid"", was that it was too short of a, well, short. The other shorts on it were okay."
2,"""Popular Science"" Overview Book","Useless if you actually want to set up a peer-to-peer network. This book is an interesting overview and history of P2P, with lots of references to standards groups, but provides no useful hardware, architecture, Internet, operating system or application program information on setting up a real peer-to-peer network, either intranet or Internet based.Good, but probably an overload, for the casual weekend book browser who wants general information on the origins, concepts, challenges, opportunities and potential (circa 2001/2) of P2P networking.For general overview, 4 stars. For useful implementation information, zero stars. Average, 2 stars."
3,DVD,Have not had chance to watch these DVDs yet. Maybe after the holiday seasonLooks very interesting and informative. Need more time
1,"Lots of repetition, typos, and hollow info","The volume contains lots of repetition of very elemental, common sense executive protection basics -- very little useful technical detail. Lots of stories that don't relate well to everyday executive protection challenges. For example: Lots of details given about motorcade techniques that will rarely get used unless you work for the USSS or DSS. -- but no detail given about agent placement when working a close protection detail. And, way too many typos, punctuation, and grammar errors for a $64 book! Not a very deep book for the price."
5,Excellent book on executive protection,"As the leading civilian authority on the U.S. Secret Service, I highly recommend this book from distinguished former agent Dale June. It is well written and very informative. Simply put, you cannot go wrong in purchasing this volume. I was a little disappointed with the 11/22/63 ""whitewash"", but that was to be expected, quite frankly (what is Mr. June going to say : ""My colleagues screwed up in Dallas?""). Get this!"
5,Magnificent! Deserves 10 out of 10 !,As a professional who has been in the industry for a long time I have read numerous publications on the subject of Executive Protection but have not come accross material such as this.I must say that Mr. June goes a step further with this book than most authors so far. He tells it as it is. The book not only covers the basics but also offers very useful information on many points to both begginers and seasonal professionals like myself. Although the book is aimed at the protection specialists in the USA some of the principles still apply world wide. I have thouroghly enjoyed it and I would definately recommend the book to anyone either interested or involved in the industry!
1,disappionted,"Unless I'm just stupid, I ordered this ring and never read anywhere saying it was a TOE ring !!!! They need to explain that it is NOT a RING but a TOE ring !!!"
2,6 our of 12 EZNET-8SW overheated,"I'm actually writing about the EZNET-8SW, which appears to be slightly different than the EZ-8SW. I purchased 12 of these switches to expand networks in our building. 6 of the 12 units have a horrible heat problem. They all get hot to touch, but 6 of them lock up regularly. Cycling the power helps for a couple hours, but then it locks up all over again. This has been an ongoing problem and unless they changed the EZ-8SW a whole lot, I can't see it being much different with the heat problem.SMC hasn't wanted to swap out the units. Each time I get on the phone with tech support, they pretty say, ""well, is it working now?"" to which I say, yeah, but in a couple hours, it won't. ""Well, if it's working now, I can't really issue an RMA."" Give me a break!I got a D-Link DSS-8+ and it never even gets hot and never locks up."
5,Great Book,Great little book. My 2 yr old loves the pictures; my 6 yr old loves being able to read the words. I've been reading this book for about 2 months straight & I haven't tired of it yet. ;)
3,Shipping very slow!!,Ordered this book on 9-23-09. Did not ship until 10-11-09. Recieved it on 10-15-09.Book was in advertised great condition although they have shipping issues.
5,Seaside Naturalist an excellent resource for all ages.,"""Seaside Naturalist"" is a wonderfully illustrated overview of all aspects of marine life. With special attention to the Atlantic coast, all topics are covered in a fun, concise, easy-to-understand manner. It's a great resource for kids from 9 to 90"
3,Only can hear out of one ear piece,The stethoscope is sensitive enough but only can hear out of one side. Can only hear out of one ear piece.
5,The Film In Audio Form,"""Unbreakable"" was an intensely dramatic film with a brilliant storyline and conclusion that will stick with me for a long time. Yet there is one thing some people might overlook when viewing it: the score. As a musician/scorist (although not employed as one), I have great respect for people like James Newton Howard. He has delivered some amazing scores. And I would have to say this is possibly his best (in my opinion, of course). Opening with ""Visions"", you are taken back to the beginning of the movie. I can just imagine it in my head -- when the title ""Unbreakable"" hit the screen as that drum beat kicked in. Every bit of emotion in the film is brilliantly captured in the score. Orchestra and all, Howard brings the experience back to us. By the end of the album, you have witnessed the magic and emotional intensity of ""Unbreakable"" all over again. If you loved this film as I did, you'll love this. And if you haven't seen it, order or rent the DVD as well!"
4,AWESOME!!!,I loved it. The music moved me deeply and it totally fit with the feel of the movie and how it portrayed the feeling of the entire movie! Excellent -unbreakable
5,Hauntingly Beautiful,The soundtrack is like the movie... Amazing! A very unique sound to backdrop a unique film.
4,PRETTY GOOD,Has some good tracks.Very motivational music.Would suit the one with a good imagination.Just hurry up and buy the dam thing.
5,Unbreakable...Unbeatable!,"This defenetly one of Howard's most emotional scores. It's beats are very good, the track listing is good, and the themes stick in my head all stinkin' day - (but that's a good thing!) I highly recomend this score to all soundtrack collectors, and you should be pleased if you buy it."
4,Halo 2 toys,"While I am sure they were designed as collection items, my kids wanted them for play. I've purchased other Halo action figures in the past and my only complaint has been their durability. Otherwise my kids have enjoyed the heck out of them. If there is ever a Halo 4 video game made I'm sure I'll be buying more."
3,Great drummer- average video,"This video is a bit of a mixed bag. The first part is VERY basic, so I suppose that part is ok if you are just beginning to play. From there it gets very complicated, which is fine, but there is very little explanation or 'breaking down' of what is going on. Also, the materials that come with the DVD are lacking. Not even a listing of chapters or a little pull out booklet with some exercises.This is probably one that had I rented it first, would probably not purchase. Nevertheless, like any of these videos, if you pick up a few new ideas its worth the investment."
5,Excellent fun and wonderful singing,"I am a fan od Ms. Migenes from a long time ago, and always enjoy her CDs. This dvd surprised me a bit, because I - somehow - did not know that Ms. Migenes has wonderful aptitude for comedy.I highly recommend this DVD to music and fun lovers."
1,Fake reviews,"These reviews sound like they are straight out of a brochure, take them with a grain of salt. Score of 1 to bring average back to reality."
2,You need a book a for this?,"I guess I was just hoping for something more profound. Most of the book boils down to listening, talking and loving. In my opinion the parent that is involved enough to look for a toddle specific behavior book doesn't need the common sense advice this book doles out. If you know a really bad parent, this might be a good gift for them but since you're good enough to want to find a book to make you better, you don't need this one."
4,makes me realize a lot of things,I am glad that I bought this book. there are lot of things that I didn't see it that way. I was able to learn many things and helps how to deal with the situation.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This book is a waste of time and money. It is written in large type with a lot of empty space on the pages. I was hoping to learn new parenting strategies to use with my 20-month old son, and didn't read anything that I hadn't heard before. The bottom line is that there is really no substance to this book at all. Each chapter is literally 1-2 pages long."
1,don't waste your time,"Such a waste of money. I thought this would be set up like ""what to expect the toddler years"" and others like it. It wasn't and had no real point of reference for anything. It was also very boring. I suggest anything but this."
5,I've used and loaned so often that my copy is now Dog Eared!,"This book is a small but powerful tool for parents! I recommend reading it even before your children hit the ""toddler years"" because this book put me in such a great state of mind for parenting. I was observing the way my daughter's caregiver was interacting with the toddlers in her room when my daughter was still just an infant and I was amazed and astounded by the approach and results that this caregiver reached with the ""Terrible Twos"". I asked her more about her philosphy and she lent me this book to read. This book still hits the heart of my current philosphy of parenting my now six year old daughter. P.S. It has worked tremendously well for with my now 3 yr old son!!! Thanks Irene and the Santa Cruz Toddler Care Center"
4,Thumbs Up for this Book,This is a great book. It isn't often I find one book that so closely characterizes my child's behavior and how I can deal with it. Easy read. Very clever. Very helpful. Gives easy guidelines...Here is problem: Here is conflict: This is why the toddler has the problem: This is what you can say and do to resolve the incident. From a fan of the Sears' books this book shares the same type of philosophy. I only wish there was more. The strategies worked miracles on my 2.9 year old boy. I give this book high praise! Helped me understand my son.
1,stupid and boring,This book is boring and the plotline ridiculous. The characters are not well thought out. It is amazing to me that people read this stuff. The side of a cereal box is more interesting.
1,Terrible,I cannot fathom that such a distinguised author would think that anyone would appreciate this drab plot. A ten year old could write a more imaginative story. The cover art was the best thing about the book. Don't bother.
4,Staffing Schools with the Best People,"Seyfarth does a fine job outlining strategies and processes for staffing schools with the best personnel. He goes on to thoroughly outline how to develop and maintain staff, including necessary professional development. Seyfarth also provides appropriate procedures for dismissal. I would recommend this book for assistant principals and principals along with human resource administrators."
1,Human Resources Management for Effective Schools,"I have yet to receive my book and I plan to ask my credit card to credit my account. It has been well over 14 days, actually it has been close to 5 weeks, since the order was placed. I am disappointed in the service.Thelma"
2,Not real impressed,"I expected a lot more from a book. There's only about 50 words or so. My 3 year old son is the biggest devotee of fire trucks around, and he got bored with this book after only a couple of readings.This would have worked a lot better as a board book/picture book for babies. The artwork is excellent and colorful. But as a bedtime story book, it just doesn't hold up."
1,No Preview,"It looks like a possible book to buy but the page previews are not available by the publisher, so since I can't even see if its appropriate I'm not buying it."
3,definitely 2500k.. too bad they dont last,"well, after 2 months of using them, one of the bulbs failed. The darn thing didnt even really blow out or burned out. Upon closer inspection, the connection from the bulb's base to the filament coil snapped and fell apart. Normally a burned bulb would have the filament snap or break.. not my case.Would I buy again? Probably not, especially if there's 2500k HID kits to get."
3,The Other Side...of ...,"You have to really like BRC to pull this one out again after you have listened to it once or twice. I was a fan of the old school Billy Ray. The subtle changes in his vocals, the way he projects his self and the lyrics of late, just not the same confident musician belting out songs that everyone could relate too."
2,Lengthy with obvious errrors,"Unfortunately this is the standard real estate text so there just aren't many other options. It covers the content fairly well but it's very frustrating to me when the book contains errors and mistakes, especially when you're using it as a reference. For instance, the Quiz Answers for Chp 7 #4 is C, but this is directly out of the CA real estate form 14B where 17 days is the default timeline for disclosures.The book is also extremely lengthy and just goes through way too much detail and repeats over and over similar topics. Quizes from different chapters have essentially the same question.The book would be better if it were 100pgs shorter, and more accurate."
3,Not quite what I expected,"The author attempts to break down the different concepts of CA real estate by presenting the concept then explaining it with an example. There are a few errors noted (mostly in spelling and grammar), but other than that the book is very easy to read and understand if you have a real estate dictionary or some other type of outside text help. The author goes over the basic principles of CA real estate, but when it comes to specifics, the book is really lacking. Overall, this book is great if one decides to use it for a class to supplement the instructor, but I wouldn't use this book in lieu of an instructor."
3,ugh.,"I bought this book knowing that there would be highlighting in the first few pages. The lister described the book like that in the description box but when I got the book the first 48 pages were highlighted. I was very disappointed and angry because I was not expecting that. Highlighting was not even nicely done, messy and highlighted things that are not even the key concepts. Its distracting to the eye."
5,Great Near Death Experience,"I really enjoyed through the Window of Life, especially since she was able to go to her own future and live it for over a year, before returning to her body, during which only a couple minutes had transpired. I feel it goes hand in hand with Visions of Glory by John Pontius, the later being even more detailed. It only takes about 2 hours to read and is definitely worth the time spent!"
1,"Not well written, confusing sometimes","I have read several books on NDE. I read all NDE books written by LDS and non LDS author. I read Suzanne Freeman's first book: ""Led by the Hand of Christ"" and I loved it! It was an amazing book and well written, but I wished I could say the same for the second book, ""Through the Window of Life"". This book was so poorly written, confusing and it just did not flow. The vocabulary was very limited more for third graders. I do not doubt of her experience, but because it was poorly written, I cannot give more stars for this book."
5,Through the Window of Life,I couldn't put this book down. It will affect the rest of my life. I have already shared it with my husband and will encourage my seven children to read it as well.
4,"30"" Wooden Swivel Bar Stool","Needed a replacement for a wooden stool purchased a local big box store.They no longer carried item. I found this stool, which is exactly like ones I have and it arrived in easy to put together sections.A good value."
4,Bar stool chair,"The chair is good quality but we thought the finish was darker, it's more of a white wash finish. The swivel works great. My kids fight over the chair because it is a different color then my other 3 bar stools. Amazon delivery is so fast."
5,Solid,"These chairs are the real deal. Solid wood. Sturdy construction. And you get it at a fantastic price. The only criticism is that the back of the chair is at a 90 degree angle, which is not that comfortable. Overall, highly recommended."
1,leg cracked,We checked the wood and all seemed fine. The second time I used the chair part of the bottom of a leg broke off. What are the odds of the rest of the leg breaking? Now the flat bottom is no longer the same as the other 3 legs.I'm 68 and don't want to add a fall to my list of problems.I would like a replacement leg.
3,They wobble,"Nice clean stools. Decent finish. Only drawback has been uneven legs so they wobble. Sent one back, and the new one wobbled. Had to ""adjust"" the legs to stop the wobble."
5,Hard to find oak bar stools,Every stool we could find local was either dark wood or metal. Nice oak stools that match our kitchen. Good quality came well packed and easy to assemble.
5,Saving my knees,"I am in need of knee replacement and cannot have surgery at this time. This is at my kitchen table enabling me to sit and stand with greater ease. Quality is very good, the swivel is wonderful. In short, I am very satisfied. Did I mention how fast it was delivered?? great all around"
4,Good quality chair,"Lovely chair with a nice finish. So far it feels sturdy. I bought this one to use in the butler area of my kitchen and got four more for my dining counter. The price was great. I couldn't find anything locally for this style, quality and price."
5,just what we needed...,This chair looks great and was easy to assemble. Took about five minutes. I highly recommend. Well worth the money- it was a bargin!
4,Just as pictured,"Stools are just as described - very sturdy and well constructed. My only problem was that one of the four stools purchased did not included enough hardware to assemble, which meant I had to locally purchase the necessary hardware. Use patience during assembly."
3,Broken twice,"Ordered six stools, one was broke, returned it, amazon sent me another, that one was also broke, returned that one as well but rather than getting another one the ignorant custom service rep just washed her hands of it and gave me a refund. Problem is I still need my final stool. I had to deal with multiple customer service reps before I finally got one who didn't talk in circles and currently still trying to assist me. I'll have to update this after I finally get my sixth stool, if I ever do. Stools are very nice though"
2,Attractive but uncomfortable,These stools match my kitchen beautifully. They are very attractive and they were easy to put together. The swivel mechanism works extremely well. The downside is that they are VERY uncomfortable. I can't imagine anyone sitting in one for more than a few minutes. With regret I plan to explore returns with Amazon.
4,"Wooden 24"" Windsor Swivel Seat Bar Stool","Winsome Wood Windsor Chair, Natural, Set of 2Great addition to my kitchen. I need a stool to sit on while preparing food and this works great with the swivel seat and the comfortable height. Recommend it to any counter height use."
3,SWIVEL SEAT BAR STOOL,"Very easy to assemble, stools are sturdy, decent value for the price, but stools do dent easily--will do until I find exactly what I want"
1,Bad chair design,This is without a doubt the most uncomfortable chair I have ever had the misfortune of buying. Has anyone from the company really ever sat in this chair. The only way to be a little comfortable is to lean forward. Forget about resting your back on the back of the chair.
2,picture may be deceiving,"The picutre of the product may be deceiving in that the picture would lead one to believe that the legs on the base are much wider, at the point where they touch the floor, than they really are. Therefore, the spokes are basically of no use to an adult. Otherwise, the product is very good."
5,EASY TO ASSEMBLE!,"Winsome Wood 24-Inch Windsor Swivel Seat Bar Stool, NaturalBAR STOOLS WERE EASILY ASSEMBLED IN ABOUT 2 MINUTES. WHERE DIRECTIONS SAY ""TURN WITH HAND"" JUST INSERT THE 2 SCREWS IN STOOL, SIT ON STOOL AND TURN 90 DEGREES AND INSERT OTHER 2 SCREWS. TIGHTEN ALL 4 AND YOUR STOOL IS ASSEMBLED! CAN'T BELIEVE THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE CRYING THEY WERE TOO HARD TO ASSEMBLE! LOVE THEM. 1 HAS TO BE RETURNED FOR FAULTY WOOD BUT WILL BE REPLACED, I'M SURE BY THE COMPANY! ASLO, RECEIVED THE STOOLS IN RECORD TIME! LOVE YOU AMAZON!!!Winsome Wood 24-Inch Windsor Swivel Seat Bar Stool, Natural"
5,excellent,"i had got the cover to protect my shotgun from the elements while it is stored away, couldn't be happier, does exactly what it says it will do, certainly would recommend to anyone"
3,An ok DVD,This DVD has four shows that are not complete. They are half an hour each.There is Geraldo's interview of MJ 200560 Minutes interview of MJ 2003Oprah's show the day before she interviewed him where she talked to other people about him 1993Oprah's show remembering Michael 2009
1,I Thought It Was A Full Costume,"I bought this for my grandson---it was not clear to me that it was only the chest piece, cape and boot covers. The belt is cheesy and flimsy. Not very happy with this purchase."
2,Not the original versions!,"These are not the original versions! They have the original artists, but they're singing in front of minimal (electronic) backup, and the tracks sound nothing like what you remember."
4,Good show......No Frills DVD's,Are they not going to release seasons 3 and beyond? It's been 9 months or so since season 2 was released. There's no pre-order for season 3. Makes me wonder if they stopped producing them b/c of low sales $. I hope they keep coming. Seasons 2-4 are best.
3,NO PLAY ALL OPTION!,"i give this 3 stars not for the show because i think this is one of the greatest sitcoms ever made, the other being ""Friends"". I have many tv shows on dvd including ""Dallas"" and ""Friends"" and what's missing on this one is the play all feature..this allows you to let it play without having to1. select the show you want to watch2. hit playi like having the show just sort of playing in the background while i work and this dvd makes me have to keep hitting play everytime an episode is done...so because of that i hate this set but love the show..hopefully the following seasons will have PLAY ALL."
4,"Fool me once, shame on you...","Thanks to ""Mad About You"" and ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", I now ignore television series on DVD until the whole set is out. Turns out I save a lot of money that way, too. There's no hurry, after all. If we all started doing this, then ""test ballooning"" the first season of a series would not work, and they'd stop."
4,JOHN ASTIN RULES!,"I don't believe what a previous reviewer said about an ""unfortunate cameo"" by John Astin during this season. That episode RULES!!! Astin doing a split reality thing - Is he Astin? Is he Gomez? was HILARIOUS and probably the best episode EVER of this sort of mediocre show."
3,Mad about this series,"I think I was deceived when I start collecting this series. I didn't imagine that Sony people don't RESPECT their customers. I want this series released until the final episode! They should release a set with all remaining episodes what is not a big work to be done considering the two initial box sets( cheap packaging, no extras, fair image quality... ).Sony MUST respect US, they MUST release remaining episodes!!!"
5,when will i be able to buy season number five?,I already have seasons one and two and i think they are great.I can't wait until you realese seasons number three and four.
4,A great TV series!!!,"I really liked this series a lot! I wish it had gone on a lot longer. Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt were at their best in this series! All of the actors were excellent and very believeable. NYC also felt like home in this series and the scenery was enjoyable. The episodes moved right along and the acting was excellent. Everyone loved Murray, the dog!!! Why would anyone discontinue such a great show???????? Buy the series while you have a chance. It's a difficult one to find, at least where I live."
5,GREAT!,Got this for my husband for V-Day and he loved every episode...but he didnt like how they mixed the episodes up...
4,Mad about you tv series,I loved the series. It made falling in love comical yet it had a serious side. Both Paul and Helen are memorable actors who show their true talent.
5,Mad About Great TV!,"I just finished watching the second season of Mad About You and I'm ready to buy the third season. You cannot really beat great television like this. Between the episode where they break John Lennon's piano bench and the episode where they misplace a homemade naughty video tape, you will find yourself laughing outloud.I wish these guys were my neighbors. But I'll settle with them on dvd. I need seasons 4-7!"
5,Great Chemistry,I was slow in viewing this program at it's beginning until I began to realize that this show had excellect charactors and story lines that have since become one of my favorites in the world of TV series. The Actors [Helen Hunt & Paul Reiser] & Writers were great and I have enjoyed the DVD releases of Seasons 1 & 2. I look forward to the next release of Season 3.
5,Fantastic Show,"This is a truly excellent program and still makes me laugh out loud. People have complained about the video quality of the release, and it would be nice if the later series were released at a higher quality, but this show isn't about incredible visuals, it's about character and humor.I hope they release the remaining seasons soon!!Enjoy the show."
5,Mad About You Season Three,"I agree that there should be behind the scenes stuff but when the show was still is production I taped all but about two episodes in the entire series so I'm just pumped they are available on DVD. It's possible that Season Three hasn't been released because of low sales $ but if all the fans let Sony know we want more, it could happen! I have found a website that helps the process. www.tvshowsondvd.comgo there and search mad about you and you should find a place to vote for seasons three and beyond, also you can vote on other shows you want to see on dvd. Tell your friends so we can get more Mad About You!!!!"
4,lovely DVD,"It left me wanting more and inspired me to follow my natural inclination to nurture, give and love. It includes the words of a wide variety of practitioners of Bhakti highlighting that there are many versions of this path."
4,some harder problems?,"Perhaps the problems could be harder? Some of them, at least. The good thing is that there are indeed many problems offered to the student. Varying in difficulty. However, some better students may bewail the lack of sufficiently challenging obstacles. Oh well.As to the text - Ward-Smith certainly covers many aspects of fluid mechanics. For an honours level course, the mathematical treatment is appropriately advanced. It seems that the differences with the 7th edition are fairly minimal. If you are not required to get this 8th edition, then an earlier edition might suffice (and be cheaper)."
2,Chalk in a Can,"I realize that protein powders never usually taste like anything, but this stuff is horrible! Smells like strawberry, tastes like chalk. I can put 2 whole bananas in my shake, and it still tastes bad. I normally drink one upon waking, and within 1-2 hours, I am sick to my stomach. I found that eating with my shake was the only way to avoid this. On the other hand, this powder mixes well, and it does smell good. SMELL good. I find that 3 scoops in 10 oz of milk mixes well enough, if only it would taste like something. I will go back to Labrada, at least chocolate tastes like chocolate with them. Oh, and good luck finding the scooper. Mine is always in the bottom of the can."
5,An Amazing Album,"This album is no less than Amazing. None...yeah I said it NONE of these songs disappoint. Every last song on ""A Little Deeper"" is filled with DIVA-esque lyrics, style, sass, and most important SOUL! All of the songs rank as a B- to A+ (The only song I would rank as a B- is ""Ramp"" because it doesn't quite fit the rest of the album...everything else (with the exception of ""Anyway U Want It"" which is a B+) is ranked from A- to A+)Stand Out Tracks (in no particular order) are:""Afraid 2 Fly""""Brother""""Put Him Out""""It Takes More""""Krazy Krush""""Dy-na-mi-tee""""Sick 'N' Tired""""Gotta Let You Know"""
3,"It's not bad...but, I've seen better..","Georgina Cruz toots her own horn on the back cover acknowledging over 108 cruises! It shows....Cruz takes the reader into a world that invites pre-information before spending money on something such as a cruise. She covers small ships, mid-size and large ships. But, like most of these titles, her information is outdated. Not her fault.She includes a section on niche cruising, like river cruising and barges. This is a new option in cruising.For $16.95, this is a good buy.For those of you who are new to cruising, buy this title. For you experienced cruisers, you're on your own. Most of this stuff you probably know, or can get this information on Internet review sites. Or at cruising.org."
1,Can't buy until I know,If you don't have an image or a good description then I have no idea what i'm buying. I'm specifically looking for Door locks with 2 keys and the clips to install.Thanks
2,Looks good but is stiff,This watch band looks great but had I known it was soooo stiff I probably would not have bought it. I am having a hard time getting it to buckle and the watch kinda sits up off the wrist. If you have a very large wrist it might work better for you. It is just really hard material. Was packed great and arrived quickly. I would order other types of bands from this seller.
4,Just as good as their last cd,"I gave it 4 stars because some of the songs are too soft and boring. These guys are better than the other mainstream nu metal bands in my opinion. I like the vocals alot because theyre alot harder than most bands. Just as good as their last release and a track featuring the Ill Nino singer on track 7. I also gave this cd a 4 because Taxicab Confession's verse is way too slow and boring. Who wants to hear a guitar tab from a bass? Anyway a great cd. If you liked this one, get their last one too."
1,Self Medicate,"If you're here because you heard ""Self Medicate"" on the radio and you think that the rest of the CD might be as good as ""Self Medicate""...meaning a driving beat with lyrics that are understandable and sing-along-to...move on...you've come to the wrong place. If you've come for what sounds like Satan at the mic behind fairly rocking music, you are indeed in the right place. Self Medicate does not represent what the rest of this disc is about...just give the samples above a listen; the samples will give you a taste of the screeching that is predominant on this CD and confirm the deception of Self Medicate in order to get airplay. No stars. Sorry, fans."
2,eh....,"i heard the song FE and rushed to buy the cd. that is a GREAT song, but save your $$ please and just download that song. the rest of the CD sounds NOTHING like that. its not a bad cd, just not as heavy and *achm* fun as FE. given, the cover of the album is pretty good. its too slow paced for my taste."
1,NU METAL HAS GOT TO GO!,"Enough of this pretend I'm hard and sing about my feelings crap. We have too many of these generic band for this to warrant any stars at all, but since I have to give it at least one here it is. People need to move on, the days of prozac are over. Let's get back to some real music now and make all these wanna be bands who got signed by a record company looking for that formula to go away. If we don't buy them, maybe they'll change the formula already!"
4,Glimmer of Nu-Metal Hope,"40 Below Summer has been a band that I have liked for a while, but I did not think that they would successfully follow up ""Invitation to the Dance"". That was a great album, but oddly enough, so is this. The single ""Self Medicate"" is a great way to start off the album and then they even put in a couple of slower tempo songs that are very effective. I was thouroughly impressed with this one. They got dropped from their label after the first one, so the production value on this one isn't quite as good, but 40BS continues to be one of the most unique acts in metal and I hope we can expect this kind of quality from them in the future. If you were a nu-metal fan or still am, this will be right up your alley. I would definetly reccomend this to people that like ill nino. Cristian from ill nino actually lends his vocals to the album, it's hard to hear, but he's on there.Band to Watch."
5,Really good album,"One of the best albums since 2000, don't care what the album sales were. I still listen to this cd to this day and will continue to do so, good job 40BLS!"
4,"Another solid, thumping effort from 40BS","I am really disappointed that 40BS is no longer together. And even though Black Market Hero is on the horizon, I am just not as excited about them after hearing demo material. I'm sure they will be good, but it's not the same. This cd was a great sophomore album. Lots of great songs and no filler. The only thing was that I didn't find any simply awesome songs, like on Invitation to the Dance: ""Wither Away"" and ""Rope"" being two examples. That is a small gripe, though, because it is a thoroughly memorable cd with hooks galore. Vocals are awesome."
4,this cd rocks,"Definitely one of those discs that grows on you. Finally a rock vocalist who can sing. I especially like Season in Hell, FE and the hidden track. More importantly thier live show is one of the best you'll see. I definitely reccommend this disc, and oh yeah, the photos rock!!"
4,/grasshoppers by Keds,"I liked the product I received. They were nice looking. Very comfortable to wear and was surprised that they fit so well. I've always been leary about ordering and not being able to try on. I wear a wide shoe and they are sometimes hard to find or even though the shoe my say a wide shoe they aren't as wide as I would hope. The Grasshopper by Keds,Ashland Sneaker was just right. Besides fitting right they seem to stay pretty clean for some time being a twill sneaker and they cleaned up well too."
4,good product,this product was what i needed just need to know the proper way to install your you will break them
5,Mysterious Mystery,"This is the first ""mystery"" novel that I have read other than the nancy drew series. I am 15, and I really enjoyed this book, it is a great mystery, and you keep on wondering till the very end. I am keen on reading her other books that she has written. I reccomned this to pretty much anybody, except for people who do not like a bit of murder in a novel"
5,Great history that reads like a novel,"There are four books in this series, The Conquering Family, The Magnificant Century, The Three Edwards, and The Last Plantagents. This series covers English history from William the Conquerer to Richard the third. Costain writes history like a novel which I personally love. I know that some people object to his approach but I personally feel that the characters of the past come alive and the history is accurate.The Three Edwards covers the reign of Edward the first through Edward the third. All history books should be this pleasurable to read. This should be in the library of all fans of English history."
2,Functional but better choices,"Purchased because needed stainless step can of this size and couldn't find a SimpleHuman unit in local stores. Functional but a bit flimsy with rough edges on the pedal, which doesn't line up with either the lid hinge (offset slightly, which grows more annoying each time the can is used) or the small foot under the pedal. Found a SimpleHuman model online for $10 more; will be ordering it soon and ""retiring"" this Polder."
2,the step broke off,"it worked fine for about a month or so... until the step came off and it stopped opening. we were able to duct tape the step back on so it worked for a few more days and then it came off again, now it is pretty much useless now unless you lift the lid with your hand which defeats the purpose of getting a trash can with a step."
4,"good product, solid","I bought this a a new kitchen trash can.Pluses -Solidly builtLid fits tightly onEasy to remove garbage with removable insertNegativeThe lid does not have an option for staying open, you must keep pressing down to keep the lid openGood product, no problem with it."
3,Okay for the price!,We have been using this can for about two years. We are still using it even though the plastic part under the foot pedal broke. It is a little less stable with the plastic part broken off but still able to use it.
2,Not as described & dented,"There was a small dent in the lid. Even more of a disappointment was a large logo label above the step that was not shown on the amazon.com picture.Would not have ordered had I known this.Need a trash can so I'm not going to return it, but I think a partial credit is in order.Second time in two days my orders have not been as advertised on amazon.com...."
5,"Excellent set, would buy another!","I wasn't sure about the quality of these sockets, as I had heard very little about the Sunex brand.However, I have been very happy with them, they seem to be very high quality, and the size markings are very easy to read, and seem very durable.They have stood up to anything I have put to them, impact wrenches and all, and no problems.I would buy them all over again!"
4,Good summary of the legend,"Biography tells the origin of the variations of the story of King Arthur and the knights of the round table. Good for those who know little about him but, as a fan of the legends, i learned nothing new from the video. But it was only 50 minutes of my life and it was worth being told again."
2,without a doubt marketed to the pre-teen; IF they have a good attention span,"I'm guessing that if I was part of the creation of this video or had a lot of money invested toward the marketing of this video, I might feel compelled to consider a higher rating than 2 star. Unfortunately, I have seen more than one other video of King Arthur legends. If you want a truly enjoyable recounting of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, or an academically valid documentary that captivates adults; you're still looking. This one is a snore. The narrator tries to add their own flourish of style to how they think Merlin might have talked. I sure wish they hadn't done that. Walt Disney Studios might be looking for him though."
4,classroom use,"This is not a bad medium to introduce Arthur to high school or college survey classes. It's not the greatest film-making; images are somewhat repetitive, presented as backdrop over the main narration, and the dialogue is mixed a bit low in the soundtrack, but it is still visually interesting while providing students a basic orientation to the rather difficult notion that the Arthurian legends actually developed over time to serve evolving societal needs; Druid mysticism, prophetic kingship, the legitimacy of divine rule, the French influence of chivalry, recovering the loss of the Holy Land, Romanticism,and more recently, utopian constructions, and neo-pagan interests. They won't catch all this one time through, but it's a memorable referential for further study."
4,Great value,"These adapters provide necessary ""glue"" to put my system together. Of three ordered, one arrived with a minor housing crack - still very useable, that's why I deducted a star - but otherwise no problems."
3,okay for the price,"I would recommend this gadget for the price.It is light and fits well on the head.The cord is long allows one a considerable range of movement.However,the sound quality has room for improvement.On the whole I would buy it...Gives a great value for the price."
1,This BBQ is baaad,I lived in Kansas City and this NOT Kansas City BBQ. There is no hickory taste and the spice is too hot. The devil might like this but I certainly don't.To top it off the seller refuses to refund my money. Don't buy from this seller!
3,An okay inside view of the Real World.,"Didn't really grab me. I thought it would have more information on what really happened. But it really didn't. It really only had tid bits that I already knew or didn't really care about. I loved the Real World. But this wasn't Real, Real World that I was expecting."
5,The Real World Rocks!,This book is great and is the source of all infomation on all The Real Worlds so far. If you're a fan this is a must have. It's helped develop 'The Real World Web Site.
3,Mantovani Orchestra is not the same as Mantovani and HIs Orc,The buyer should be aware that anything by the Mantovani Orchestra is not the same as a recording by Mantovani AND His Orchestra. The quality difference is like night and day. I am sure Mantovani would not have allowed such releases under his name.
3,"Not bad, but could be better for the price","I can't say it wasn't as advertised, and is a solid protector of my laptop with the extra padding. Still, I think it would be even better if it opened so that the laptop could be used within the case.Other than that, a good product."
1,Terrible quality,This case arrived as packaged by the manufacturer. Upon opening the zipper was already broke. The nylon teeth would not mesh together and stay together and that was without putting anything in the case. I have a Dell Inspiron 1750 which is a 17.3 inch screen. The V opening would allow the laptop to fit in one direction. The handles were not well padded and carrying that large of a laptop by the case handles would be uncomfortable after a short time. I was very disappointed. I also got stuck paying the shipping and handling fees (almost $10.00) to get a bad product. But at least Computer Brain did have FedX pick it up at no charge to me.
4,Does the job.,"A sturdy case, my computer measures 15 inches across and there is lots of room. It does the job for me but I don't travel much. I don't think you could carry a lot of extra stuff in this case but there is room for papers and a few things."
5,Great value,"Just as described; durable, roomy, good quality. I saw similar cases at a big box electronics store for $80 - $100. This product is a great value."
2,Bright light but must hold switch.,"Received flashlight and cranked it up. Very good, bright light but only has a push button for a switch. Push it down you got light, release and no light. I don't know if it is a bad switch or a feature. I would recommend purchasing a different flashlight."
1,Does not hold charge... Never heard back from vendor for return,"After cranking for 1 minute, the light stayed on for less than 30 seconds.GARBAGE... you get what you pay for. Not even worth the time to pursue a return after trying once."
3,Average light,"This Kaito is better than the Faraday type, however the light come out is not strong enough and quickly fade out.If you want to buy the Wind-up type, should find a Uni-Com brand, much better with strong light.But it is sold by Amazon UK.You can get it here:http://www.amazon.co.uk/LED-Dynamo-Wind-Up-Torch/dp/B001RWX4JO/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s;=kitchen&qid;=1258427373&sr;=8-4"
1,Softcore borefest - don't waste the $,"You may break the FF buttom while viewing this. Too soft, too ""high concept"", never goes anywhere and worst of all, NOT EROTIC. Get a Peach DVD instead."
5,physical education tips from the trenches,I can totally relate to this book. It helps me to cope with my job and be ready for any obstacle that may arise. The humor was fun and the read was enjoyable. I think it would be great for teachers just going into PE too.
4,READ ME,"This DOTM book is about Jimena. Catty recklessly drops her in the past as a last chance to save the future. Thing go wrong and she ends up dealing with gangs again. I really liked this book, but I totally hated the end. I mean I know it would happen soon enough, but not like that and not so soon. I wish I could rewrite the end, but ohh well, maybe there will be some weird miracle and all the Daughters will be able to stay goddesses(I wish!!)"
5,The Choice,"This edition of DOTM stars Jimena. In an attempt to save the other daughters she has Catty take her back in time to stop one of the Daughters from betraying the others. Unfortunately she lands in gang territory where she meets up with her old rival, Payasa. After a showdown Jimena makes her escape only to be caught by the cops and sent to jail. With the help of someone from the Daughters past (who I hope to see more of in the future) she escapes. Will she be able to stop the traitor? To find out you gotta read the book!This book was amazing. The ending was a complete shock and so was the identity of the ""traitor"". I can't wait for Book 10: The Talisman."
3,The choice,A girl named catty accidentally dropped a girl named Jimena into her old trobled past and back into her old gang called 9 street neighorhood. Jimena had ran for her life and had been caught by the police and was put into a jevenile . she had a choice and its to break out of jail and has to hide out with an old gang enme paysa from 4 street .pasya and jimena will both save daughters of the moon before Jimena bad dream comes true.
5,I love the Goddesses,I got this book from my best friend. She has all the books of the Goddesses and she says this one called the Choice was really good. I have been reading it this weekend and I like Jimena and her friend. I like it because I feel like I'm inside the story with them and that is what I like best about the book because I don't know I'm reading. Get it?
5,Telekinetic( like Tianna),"ok maybe my name isn't the best right now. Those who have read will know what i am talking about. But [wow] this story is good, but why does the ending hae to be so sad. i can't wait till the next one comes out.So anyway the story is told by Jimena and at the begining you are already sent back in time to stop something from happeing that you will learn about as it happens again. It is totaly suspensful and i couldn't even pay attention in class a put a book in front of it and read it during class. That is how good it was"
5,Bets book ever!,This is one of the best books ever from Lynne Ewing! We find out who betrays the Daughters finally!
5,WOW,"that was one of the best DOTM books yet!!after catty takes jimena to the past to fix things in the present, she almost gets killed, goes to jail, and figures out which daughter betrays them! the end is amazing!! so so sad but the best ending to theses that i have ever read!! i am not gonna ruin it but if you even remotely like DOTM you must get adn read this book!!"
5,Too good for App Dev1 & App Dev2,"I read through App Dev 1 part of the book and it was good. Though I didn't read the App. Dev 2 chapters (I passed both exams!) I know for a fact by going through the contents that it is the closest you can get to the actual Notes exams. Also the sample questions is what prepared me for the App Dev 2 exam, due to my past experience of 3yrs with Notes dev. Some of the questions were repeated in the exam too! The Book is good for App. Dev 1 & App. Dev 2. No doubt about it. Minor mistakes exist in the samle questions but if you have worked in Notes earlier you will know it."
4,Very good book for CLS certification exam!!!,I used this book to study for the Lotus Notes Application Development exam (190-271). I spent a little more than two weeks preparing and found this book to contain information very useful and close to the actually exam. I would recommend this book to anyone looking to pass the Application development exam for CLS/CLP status. I passed with 94%. (75% required to be certified)
1,Product never arrived,"I ordered this product on March 16, 2004 and still have not received it over a month later. Goodness knows when or if it will ever arrive. I would not recommend Golfbargins.com to anyone."
3,it broke fast,"Here what 7-year-old craig says: ""You want a toy and the box looks great and then when you get it home you open it and then you play with it for a little bit and then, bam, it breaks. but i still like it."" what broke? immediately it seemed to mom, tartarus' hammer broke, all the Halo figures (craig got three for his birthday) broke in one way or another right away."
1,Unreadable,"I purchased this book and actually found it irritating to read. It's as though sentences were constructed in the longest possible fashion simply to fill pages in the narrative portion. Or, the author is extraordinarily pompous with the written word. Hoping to learn more about the movement to establish ""Westsylvania"", I ended up skimming it for some facts that I can follow up somewhere else, preferably presented in a more readable, to the point manner. This is only the second time in a long book buying history that I've encountered writing so poor that I felt obligated to speak up. The lists of the pioneers in the later half of the book may be useful, but they can be found elsewhere for far less."
5,Can't Get Enough!,"If you love Art Deco, you will enjoy this book. The photos are excellent(you can frame them!), as is the text.A great coffee table book and an engaging read."
5,Another Excellent McCreight Instructional Book,"After having enjoyed his ""Jewelry: Fundamentals of Metalsmithing"", I decided I definitely wanted to purchase Tim McCreight's book on boxes and lockets. I had no doubt that this book would be as informational and interesting as the previous book, and I was not wrong. This well-written book excels not only in its specialized instruction in hinges and catch mechanisms, but also in its foundation of basic and intermediate metalsmithing. In addition, the wealth of color photographs of works by many other artists in addition to the author provides a veritable trove of inspiration for one's own original pieces. The appendices provide helpful information and numbers pertaining not only to fabricating boxes and lockets, but to all silver and goldsmithing in general. I must concur with the general consensus that McCreight's book are all essential resources for the metalsmith."
5,Boxes and Lockets: Beautiful!,"Of all the Tim McCreight books I own so far, I'd have to say this one is my absolute favorite.I had been looking at this book for a while but the price scared me a bit. I finally got smart and Googled it and found it for a much more reasonable price. And I am so glad I did.This book will teach you so many things that can be applied to your jewelry making. You'll learn how to make several different hinges, closures, and catches as well as design, fabrication, forming, soldering techniques and more.This book is beautifully illustrated with color photography and many many photos of completed designs to inspire you and get your creative juices flowing.This is an absolute must have book in any jewelery designers library!"
3,rather dull,I didn't finish this book as I became bored with the content. It was a good try at portraying life in England.
3,English,"The book was in okay condition, not great as advertised, and it shipped from the UK, not from Florida as advertised (this is not really a problem, but it took a lot longer than one would have thought). South Riding is a fascinating 1930's British feminist kind of perspective on the British class system at the time, the clash between industrialists and the older landowning farmer class, and the rising middle class. A very interesting read, if you're into all things English."
4,Pre-war Yorkshire tale,"I bought this as an 80th birthday present for my Yorkshire mother. She is thoroughly enjoying it, saying that it is so true to how life was lived before the Welfare State. Winifred Holtby - whose own story was told in Vera Brittain's Testament of Friendship - cleverly used the framework of council meetings and concerns to show just how such decisions touched the lives of ordinary men and women in the 1930s.Definitely worth a read, if only make you thankful you live in more enlightened and socially protected times."
1,OK if you have robotic arms,"When I moved out of state, I had to think of ways to bring my Playstation games with me while lightening the load of my luggage. So I put all my games on an old CDR spindle, removed the artwork and booklets, and donated the cases to my favorite local games shop.Later, after I found steady work and was secure in my new environment, I started searching for some replacement cases. I settled on these ones and I'm not particularly happy with them. The outside seems to be the same plastic jewel case you'd expect, but the trays inside are made of a shoddy plastic that will literally rip if you are not completely meticulous when taking them out.Anyway, I bought five, and I broke two. One I was able to salvage with super glue, and the other I had to ""borrow"" a tray for. That's right, I had to replace a tray on a replacement case!"
4,Good fun for 7 year old boy,My son has been enjoying this addition to his Bionicle collection. He has fun putting them together and then taking them apart to make new creations by mixing up the pieces from other Bionicles.
3,Keep Producing Round Ended Condoms,"As much as i love the trojan brand, they should never have gotten rid of the round ended condoms.there the original & the best ive used.I'd prefer the round ended condom instead of the nipple or teat end.it feels much more natural than other condoms ive used.That & Lambskin condoms have become my top fave."
5,Reservoir tip,"Howdy! Please note that as of late 2008 that this product features a reservoir tip, and no longer has a rounded end. This change was made by the manufacturer without changing the packaging or SKU, and so it is impossible to tell by looking at the product if the condom inside has a rounded end or reservoir tip, though it seems that all the current shipping product from the manufacturer has a reservoir tip."
3,passing,"I think it really depends on your study style. For me, I like the CD, and I didn't read the book. I passed my exam on the first try."
3,A Leap of Faith,"Bought this as a leap of faith. I have enjoyed previous Cura recordings. Don't know what the folks at Kultur were thinking. The DVD cover has no list of songs for the production. There is no libretto inside. Worse, the performance lacks subtitles except for one dialog, a reading from Don Alvero. Having said that Jose' Cura's performance is quite satisfying. He is accompanied by Daniela Dessi, who is at times distracting with her facial expressions, but also sings quite well. Cura conducts the orchestra in several of the overtures. It adds nothing to the performance. For the record the DVD includes overtures to Nabucco, Les Vespres Sicilennes, Don Carlo and La Forza Del Destino. There are two arias from Il Corsaro, one from Ernani, one from Il Torvatore and Aida. ""Lo vengo a domandar"" and ""Tu che le vanita"" are included from Don Carlo. The disc concludes with a selection from La Forza del Destino and ""Gi nella notte densa"" from Otello."
2,"Give Up The Baton,Cura!","Oh,please Cura...Get some tuxedo(he dressed a black camisole at Barbican),give up baton and SING,only!In fact,this is a fine soprano Daniela Dessí recital.Mr.Cura believes himself the most terrific conductor(terrible Nabucco overture)actor,singer,Verdiexpert,host,...in this world.""Lasciate ogni speranza"" about this beautiful tenor voice and don't waste your money."
2,Sorry - needs reworking,"It seems that lesbians writing as gay men do a better job of it than gay men as lesbians.Likely that lack of experience with female sexuality among the men limits their knowledge, so that they imagine that the female orgasm is as easy-to-provoke as their own. (Certainly honest accounts of women's experiences have been historically harder to come by, no pun intended, than masculine accounts and descriptions.) There were too few memorable personalities in this book. I could always ""tell"" that a man was writing the lesbian point of view. 'Erotica' shouldn't double as a parlor game - of which gender wrote what."
5,Bought this for my Dad and he loves it!,I bought this light for my Dad as a present and he loves using it outside in his 'Man Cave' to do work at night.It is bright and easily hooks onto something for better light!
4,New and old holiday hits,This CD is really nice because it has both the older holiday music and the newer holiday music. That way my daughter and my mother both can listen to the same CD and enjoy it together.
3,Could have been a little better,"Granted that depends on your tastes. Your 10 to 12 year old daughter will probably love some of these tracks. However, this compilation comes nowhere near the 1st one. It's not bad and there are some ""standards"" on here by Elton John, Wham, Gloria Estefan and the Waitresses (which have the best tune in this set). It's all over the map, artist wise. It just seems to me that there wasn't much thought put into this compilation."
4,Now That's What I Call Christmas! 2 CD,This is a pretty good Christmas music CD. It has two disks. The songs include a lot of modern Christmas songs. There are quite a few I enjoy for the holiday season.
5,Excellent follow up holiday set,"The Now Christmas Volume 1 set was a five star smash. Hard to top but Volume 2 of the series has just as much of a diverse and good selection. Destiny's Child with Opera of the Bells is a wonderful opening. Elton John, Wham and other 70s and 80s singers get their due. Love Peggy Lee's Happy Holiday and Celine's O Holy Night. And Andy Griffith does a surprisingly good job with Go Tell it on the Mountain. Throw in Louis ""Satchmo"" Armstrong, Striesand, and a live version of Jose's Feliciano's Feliz Navidad and you've got a eclectic but great sounding collection of tunes, something to please everybody. A MUST HAVE for your holiday CD collection."
4,correction of earlier reviewer's post,"mr. jefford is incorrect about the song ""please come home for christmas""on this cd. this song by luther vandross is not the same ""please come homefor christmas"" that the eagles recorded. that one was a cover of the greatcharles brown song; this luther song was an original for his christmas cd afew years ago."
4,Best Christmas Album,"This is a fantastically stylish Christmas CD. Not to blast Luthor Vandross (whom I really like), but I would have given this CD five stars if it had been the Eagles version of ""Please Come Home for Christmas"" instead of his. Otherwise, its a great buy."
3,"Good, Solid, CD","Well, I'm not going to be like the Whitney Houston fan who really has not heard the album, just putting it down so Whitney's may sell better and crack the top 50 of Billboard.This cd is a good collection of holiday hits, but two stars are knocked down for the horrendous rendition of Baby, It's Cold Outside. These guys really should have used Jane Monheit and Steve Tyrell's version which is far superior!"
2,It's either Been There Done That or Never Wanted to Do That!,"We had this CD on in our store during the holiday shopping season this year...unfortunately. Either the stuff on here could be found elsewhere and plenty of elsewheres (ie. ""Christmas Wrapping"" by the Waitresses, though that's one of the few HIGH points on this disc), many of the songs on this disc are headache enducing. Why, oh why, did anyone let the version of ""Baby, It's Cold Outside"" by Tom Jones and some chick whose name I never bothered to learn out of the studio? It's horrible. We would race to the CD player to skip that one and plenty of others."
2,Now That's What I Call Christmas! The Signature Collection,"I purchase this cd, and I have to say its okay. I also purchase Whitney Houston's Christmas album ""One Wish"". Oh my god, Whitney Houston holiday album will simply blow you away. The way she put all her heart, and soul into every song on her christmas album is beautiful. I'm so happy I purchase Whitney's ""One Wish"". I would have been so lost without it. It's the perfect christmas music for season. I recommend Whitney's ""One Wish"" if you wanna hear good Christmas songs. Nobody can do it like her, we all remember how she sung ""I Will Always Love You"" don't you? Can't go wrong with Whitney!"
3,Its an ok cd,"Some of the songs are wonderful but I could do without Destiny's Child and B2K doing their renditions of some old classics. Good thing there is a fast forward button on the cd player. I LOVE the classic songs sung by Andy Williams, Johnny Mathis, Andy Williams, etc. It does have a good variety of music."
2,"Not bad, but not as good","Now That's What I Call Christmas Volume 1 is better. Volume 2 has offerings from current pop stars that lack the warmth and staying power of Christmas classics on Volume 1 from Bing Crosby, Elvis Presley, Burl Ives, Johnny Mathis, Nat King Cole, etc. Buy Volume 2 if you can't find Chuck Berry's ""Run Rudolph Run"" or Jose Feliciano's live version of ""Feliz Navidad"" anywhere else; otherwise skip this hackfest."
3,Not the best shorts,"The shorts included in this collection I would not say are the best out there.... certainly no where near the caliber of the shorts included in the 2006 Oscar-nominated collection, which I love."
3,ok,"Wanted to show my students while gone to a funeral but the films didn't arrive in time so I watched them once and they'll probably end up on a shelf somewhere and collect dust. No, wait. I'll toss them in my pile to Good Will."
4,The early eighties at its best,"I come from the same town as Depeche Mode and so spent my early teens listening to this kind of stuff. And this was the track that started it all off. Tinny bleeps and Dave Gahan's rough vocals only add to the atmosphere. Had this been recorded on a big budget, it wouldn't have been so memorable."
5,Grunt's RULE,"I picked this toy up in Gamestop and it is cool how it has it's camoflouge look. He is poseable and fun to use. But, his fin broke on me. But, I just got the glue gun and put it back together"
4,"Great Album, Not So Good In Comparison","Turn On The Bright Lights Was A Benchmark Debut album for interpol, with almost every song on it brilliant. but it was easy to see how they could be compared to JD. Antics has taken a different turn and in my oppinion tryin to shake there similarity to JD, Still non the less if you are an interpol fan this is a must by, because it does have some great tracks on it,On its own this is a great album, just dont compare it to bright lights"
5,high exepectations fullfilled,"I was so intruiged by Interpols first hit from this album ""Slow Hands"" so i decided to go out and buy the full album. I had such high expectations-and well you know what...they were SO fullfilled. ( sorry but my spelling is way off) Besides the vocals of talented lead frontman Paul Banks;the guitarist Daniel Kessler's background vocals are so soothing. Antics has so many songs that are so inspiring as well as soothing to the mind...i personally enjoy the keyboard in the background in several of the songs which is very appealing. Although the encasing of the album reminds us of the ""White Album"" from the beatles the photography inside the album booklet is very well done. so overall your money spent on Interpol's Antics was well utilized!"
3,Deja vu,"I anticipated this album as much as the next Interpol fan...and it's good. BUT for about half of the songs on this album, the intros are practically direct rip offs of songs from TOTBL. Almost felt the urge to check if I had put in TOTBL by mistake. Granted, the songs generally do not CONTINUE to sound like direct rip offs after about the first 30 seconds, but still it annoyed me. So if you liked TOTBL, you'll either a) love this because it sounds so similar (I heartily disagree with other reviewers that say this sounds like a 180 degree turn for the band) or b) like me you'll be a bit annoyed by the similarities. Let's hope they come up with some new intros for the next album."
2,weak,"i had a really hard time getting into this cd. i don't own their earlier cd's, but i have heard they are good. however, after listening to this it made me not want to hear any of their earlier stuff. although i would hope its better than this. don't get me wrong, this isn't terrible. in fact, i don't even think its necessarily bad. i just think its bland, and yes, i've heard it way more than once. i just can't get into it. it doesn't make me want to get up or sing along or dance or cry. i am not one of those people that writes a review for indie music but listens to slipknot or korn or linkin park. i am definitly a fan of the genre, but i just didn't find the energy that i would have to hear from this cd. it has grown on me a little, but it took many many listens. yet, this cd got fairly good reviews and if you're a long-time fan you will probably like it. however, if you are new to this band but like the genre, don't expect much"
1,belief in one's own hype,Interpol hate the Joy Division/post-punk comparisons yet they continue to dress-up and pose in the post-punk fashion. this album is another thing. it's a bland disappointment. Turn On The Bright Lights was kind of interesting; Antics is not. i'm tired of the bands today that just dress up and play re-heated genres. this is one of them.
2,"So, where is the originality?","Clearly, Interpol's lead singer tries hard to sing like Ian Curtis. But that's not all. The lyrics, the basslines, everything sounds like Joy Division on a hangover. Even the band Colder from France is more authentic than Interpol.""Evil"" and ""Slow Hands"" are fine songs. But after listening to them just once, you will surely grab your copy of ""Unknown Pleasures"" and play it."
1,Touch your thighs I'm the lonely one?,"Seriously, think about this.""Touch your thighs I'm the lonely one""Whisper it to yourself a few times, and ask yourself, can an album with even one lyric that bad possibly be any good?My answer: Hell no!I really don't get this one."
4,Am I the first to be disappointed?,"I would have welcomed a repeat of their debut album, but alas, bands evolve. The new album lacks the vitality and seriousness of the first album.The first album was hypnotizing, and could always put me in a trance (especially in concert). No one will dare to compare them to Joy Division anymore. Antics is far slower and carefree than the debut.Interpol toned down their repetitiveness and added more texture to their sound."
1,"Not as good as TOTBL, which was just OK anyway","Yeah... I picked this up at the mall after the cool alternative guy in study hall told me what a great band this is. I don't know what is so great about ""Antics"". I always thought alternative music is supposed to be different. This seems more boring than Brittney... as for Interpo' being cute, I'd have to say, being a guy, I prefer Brittney."
5,excellent!,"INTERPOL has become one of my favourite acts at this time: over the years there always seems to be more and more bands that just cannot get my attention with their empty-hype-copycat-commercial garbage, but once in a while comes a superb band with original and great vibes that shakes your head! Interpol is an example of those kind of bands that comes to make history. ANTICS is a great album, with good vibes, wonderfull rythm tunes and melodics, and a kicking ass bass grooves that give you the goosebumps! This vinyl is an excellent gift you can give yourself or to someone you care and that loves good music. As a Interpol fan you gonna love have this quality sounds in your repertoir."
5,awesome,I just saw these guys on the Antics tour as it hit Phoenix Az. It was amazing to say the least. These guys are a godsend to the music biz. This album is so good. I have played it almost non stop since its release. It is a great follow up to TOTBL. Pick this one up!
5,AWESOME!!!,"This album is just great! I ran to Towers Records to buy it this morning, and the more I'm listening to it, the more i love it! Remember how you were amazed by the first album? It's gonna be the same with this one.Plus this OPENDISC features is great: I registered (very simple, done in 10 secs after I popped the CD in my Mac), and I'm really looking to know more about the band, now!! Everyone should register!!"
4,Not Even Jail,"Am I the only one that thinks this song is a masterpeice unto itself? Maybe I'm just going through a temporary obsession with this song, but I think it's one of Interpol's most powerful. I saw them in Boston a couple weeks ago and ""Not Even Jail"" was the musical highlight for me. Brilliant lyrics on top of soulful music. Oh yeah, and since I'm reviewing the album I'll say it's pretty darn good. I suggest that people give an album a few listens spread over a couple weeks before posting reviews...your taste may change."
4,By this CD now!,"I had judged the book by it's cover. Being a NYC resident I had seen Interpol on Magazine covers all over town. I figured they were today's flavor, God was I wrong.Being a long time fan of bands like Joy Division, New Order, The original Echo and the Bunnymen, Interpol has captured that genre, and without copying, have made it their own.I have not stopped listening to this since I picked it up last weekDon't wait, pick up a copy asap!"
2,Not the real deal,Interpol has a very cold and mechanical sound typical of the 80s. Every song is driven by the same lifeless staccato guitar riffing and simplistic drum beat meaning it gets very monotonous. The vocals are also uninteresting and try to cash in on the Ian Curtis worshipping. This may have worked for the band on their first album but it's only a matter of time before people realise this music has little substance and will be piling up in the discount bin of their local music store.
2,alright effort.........,im not a big fan of interpol but when i heard slow hands i thought i should pick this up. i think that you will either love it or hate it. i certanly dont hate interpol because they made good stuff in the past. this album is too short as well.
2,"Dis be meaty ocre, I wanna help!","Yo, homies. I be a dj downtown and I know music inside-oot. Dis Interpol album bee jammin' after I is thru. I can hook up some beats on my Dr. Rhtyhm and all da ho's and ganstas be raisin da roof. Since I have to be supplyin' da beats to make dis rekkid sound phat, I give it two stars. Yo, Interpo' du's... Have you thought about addin' a DJ to yer posse? Yo, gimme a page, cuz I think I can improv yer def jams."
3,Just Alright,"I thought this album was interesting to a point, but it tended to run together for me. Each song sounded like the next, and nothing really hooked me. I thought it was about average, although the general sound was interesting, something I haven't heard much of. This is all I've ever listened to of Interpol, I will have to check out their first album I suppose. Anyhow, I don't think this album was fantastic, but it wasn' bad."
2,Blah...,"I have no pretensions about the purity of the indie scene. The only thing that concerns me is the music coming out of the speaker. And on that basis, Antics is a disappointing album. It's not so much that it's ""bad"" exactly. The feel is appealingly detached, static, and monotone, and Interpol sounds like a prom band from the 1950's as played by zombies- which is a concept that I kind of dig. But the songs melodically go nowhere, and the underlying emotion is unconvincing and fails to transcend the detached style. ""Evil"" has a good chorus but doesn't coalesce. ""A Time to Be So Small"" uses a chord progression with lots of potential, but there's no melody. Interpol need better content for their next album."
2,Overrated,"Everyone seems really into this cd, but the painfully honest truth is this cd is nothing very unique, special or interesting at all. In general it is slow, drony, and minimalistic. Sometimes this works. ""Take You on a Cruise"" is beautiful. ""Not Even Jail"", ""Narc"" and ""A Time to be so Small"" are okay. But the singles ""Evil"" and (especially) ""Slow Hands"" are horribly overrated and a majority of the album sounds like modest mouse meets radiohead - a sound you would expect to be really cool, but just doesnt work here. I have heard their other album is better, but this cd didnt exactly get me into the band."
1,"I bought Antics, then returned it...","I bought Antics based on all the hype, and then returned it shortly thereafter. It's a crude pop album, and nothing worthy of the ""alternative"" label. This is probably why the majority of 5 star reviews are written by adolescents.I couldn't make it through the whole album. I ejected it after 5 songs. I should have ejected it sooner!"
1,I am confused,"Music tends to bring out emotion. Music can bring out happiness, anger, sadness, and so on. Music has always brought out an emotion every time I hear a song. Even if I hate the band or just hate the song, it still brings out some sort of emotion.However, with Interpol, this band just confuses me. I listen and I hear, but no emotions appear in my mind, I am just confused. Confusion is not an emotion, it is a state of being.And I do not like the state of confusion.Thus, I do not like Interpol.It's as if this band had set out to make boring, tiresome music that makes no sense. Luckily for them, they don't have to try, they just have to get hyped in Spin and NME. Continue on listening to this blank music devoid of emotion and one day music will no longer exist. It will just be white noise."
1,Interpol are rockin' the frat house,"One of my bra's just bought this new Interpol CD, Antics. It's rockin' the frat house! I gave this one star because the Interpol dudes are total girlyman wusses. But this is a great album after slammin' 15 Coors Lights down the beer bong... Yeah, where's that camel toe at bra'?"
5,Awesome,"I am quite new to Interpol, but I like just about every song on this album. Evil, Narc, Slow Hands, and C'mere are particularly great."
4,Good Enough,"Interpol started off their career with one of the greatest albums of the last 20 years. The Strokes did something similar. The Strokes were torn apart by the success of their first album, essentially sending the band on an unending spiral into boringness. Interpol managed to stay on top of their game with their second release ""Antics"".This album doesn't have the magical textures of Turn on the Bright Lights or the Joy Division feel, but it is still a strong album with several great standout tracks including ""Slow Hands"" and ""Not Even Jail"".I have listened to Antics 7 times in full. You should give it a listen and decide whether you like it or not. If you are an elitist than this isn't for you, but if you are an Interpol fan than this is worth the money."
5,the argument,"Many of my friend liked ""Antics"" better than ""Turn on the Bright Lights""... I disagree, but this is definitely worth buying. Let's hypothesize that ""Antics"" was Interpol's studio debut and ""Bright Lights"" never was recorded - I would still think that Interpol was one of the greatest Indie bands ever."
4,Just as good as the first . . .,"I'm not going to try to pass myself off as some sort of savvy rock journalist but more like an avid listener to good music. I bought ""Turn on the bright lights"" based on a simple review from Q magazine, I had no idea of their sound or influences. Very few albums have ever reeled me in with the first note but with Interpol it was quite different; I was immediately enraptured with their unique sound. With their second album, I got the same feeling. It's wonderful to buy an album and be able to listen to it from beginning to end, and most importantly, never get sick of hearing it over and over again. They're also a great live band. I've been lucky enough to see them in concert twice now, so if they're ever in your neck of the woods, I urge you to go see them, you won't be disappointed"
4,Really Hypnotic Music by An Amazing Band,"There should be no doubt about the fact that ""Antics"" is another success for Interpol. As a follow-up to the band's impressive debut, ""Antics"" might be ever-so-slightly less adventurous, but it is a more focused, confident sound that has a playfully seductive edge to it. Whereas ""Turn On The Bright Lights"" was mostly murky and decadent, ""Antics"" is generally clean and vibrant - they're both brilliant in their own way, but ""Antics"" has been sneaking into my CD player with increasing regularity this month. Carlos D plays the most hypnotic bass line I've heard in a long time (""Evil"", ""Not Even Jail""), and if ""Take You On A Cruise"" and ""Slow Hands"" don't make you nearly swoon with their awesomeness, I'd get someone to check your pulse."
5,Very very good music,Not much to say - they are amazingly good. I saw Interpol in Chicago last March and I will go to see them again whenever I get a chance.
3,Average...,"I used to listen to Interpol almost on a daily basis a few years ago. Considering myself a big fan, after such a wonderful album like ""Turn on The Bright Lights"", I was expecting this one fervently, in an attempt to satisfy myself with not-so-new(considering Post Punk has nearly 20 years around), yet provocative music.The day came, and after the first 3 songs, I was already dissappointed, realizing I am a mere fan of ""Turn On The Bright Lights"", and not of Interpol as well.This album lacks passion and attraction. The songs, most of them are weak, excluding, in my opinion, ""C'Mere"", ""Take on a Cruise"", and ""Evil"", which ended up getting on my nerves after a few listens. Wanna listen to good Interpol songs? Check out ""TOTBL"", I don't think they'll ever top ""Stella"" or ""The New"", even if they have the ability..."
4,a rumor,"Went to a show where interpol were the undercard. A friend of mine has liked them since the beginning, but I had only heard snippets. Today I'm buying both of their albums, because I've never seen a more technically competent live rock act before. I'm not a professional concert-goer by any means, but when a ""noobie"" to a band's songs is infected by the 3rd one that's a good sign. These guys blazed away in front of 4,000+ people like it was their show. And their hair did look good.I support musicians who take their jobs seriously, take the time, and make the effort to show everyone what they're about. 4 stars for the band, and hopefully the album lives up to it once amazon delivers it."
4,a treatise on this interpol,"now peeps, i liked the album. i totally rock out every time i play it. however, there is a behemoth of a problem with the title of this record. if one hears that an album has the name ""antics,"" they expect to hear a zippy escapade of gamesome fun, and rightfully so. however, there is no such monkey business in ANY of these songs. I can't help but ask, where has society failed us? how has it come to pass that people can go around and choose album titles that are both misrepresentative and inaccurate, and subsequently, insult the intelligence of the masses with such ludicrous actions. i will pray for this 'interpol.'"
1,Blowz Chunkz,"This is not that good at all. I've never hear Joy Division, so I can't comment on the plagerism/derivative issue. However, after purchasing this CD and listening to it, I do agree that I basically bought one song and paid for ten. All of these songs are the same. These guys are so into their shtick that they spoon out their monthly fruits of constipation and garnish their cornlflakes with them... Homogeneous, as another poster had pointed out, is a euphamism. I bought one song for $15.99. Please, figure out how to write a decent rock album! Can I return this album to Amazon or their record label? It seems fair, and in accordance with the law as well. This is fraud."
4,Avoiding the sophomore slump,"Following up a stellar debut is never an easy task and at first listen 'Antics' sounds like another case of the sophomore slump. However with repeated listenings, the melodies start to reveal themselves along with the same angular guitars, haunting vocals and steady rhythm section that pulled you in on TOTBL.Highlights are the lead track ""Slow Hands"" along with ""Evil"" which is the 2nd featured track here. Other favorites include ""Narc"", ""Take You On A Cruise"" & ""Not Even Jail"".Now that they've passed the test on record #2 Interpol have the chance to become very special as their retro moody sound is a breath of fresh air on airwaves dominated by faux punk and manufactured pop stars."
1,intricate and angular? spare me the hype!,"""Antics"" is a very simple, formulaic pop album. Many people maintain that this work is ""angular"" and ""intricate"".People tend to confuse angularity with staccato. This is staccato and not angular. This is about as angular as a straight line. If you want to hear a good definition of ""angular"" check out ""Larks Tongues in Aspic"" by King Crimson, which is over 30 years old and is still more timeless, ""intricate"" and ""angular"" than Interpole could ever hope to be.As far as ""intricate"", I'd have to say this is quite plain, straightforward, and simplistic. It's a pop album, and not even a good one at that. It's about as ""intricate"" as a glass of distilled water."
3,Not amazing but it is sure fun.,I have listened to some of the songs on the second album and I own the first album. I will say they are not amazing musicians but I love the way they sound. If you love the Pet Shop boys you will love this or if you like Joy Division. I love them there good at throwing out simple catchy tunes. Although the reason I only gave them only 3 stars was because they each song sounds to much like the last so I guess every song is good. But I like a bit of change up in my music.
5,5+,"There is one word to describe Interpol and the music from their second album, weird. And that is why it is the best non-greatest hits album I have purchased this year.(Although, I am really anticipating the next big thing from Everclear.:) I also like the the red, black, and white theme. It goes well with the music I think. Besides that, those colors are easy on the eyes. In short, I liked the album. But come on, why would I actually waste the time to review an album I don't care for? I never have before and I have no incentive to start now. A+ for Interpol!"
1,Did someone say Ian Curtis?,"These guys rip off Joy Divison on every level. I'm sorry, but there is nothing exciting about Interpol. Buy a Joy Division record and ignore these guys."
1,Musical Chop Suey,"""Antics"" is about as alternative as chop suey is Chinese! This is a completely fake alternative album that is fine for the high school kids. Anyone in college who listens to college radio will find this tiresome. I'm not surprised by all the 5 star ratings. There are plenty of morons who would think this is the best album ever. This must be one of their 3 CD's -- the other two being Creed and Green Day."
2,Not even as good as 80's music,"As a music fan, I like to break out and explore new things. I recently bought ""Antics"" based on a review I read, and all the buzz I've been hearing about Interpol. I'm a little bummed out by this album. It's not as alternative, or different as I thought. Even by 80's standards, this is kind of conventional. If you're into conventional music, then I should suggest ""Antics"". If you're looking for something different, try The Residents, or some other 80's band that did something special.Some say this sounds like 80's alternative music, but that would be a compliment beyond what ""Antics"" deserves. I'd say it sounds like 80's mainstream music, marketed as 2000's alternative music."
1,A few steps back from where they began,"I eagerly anticipated this album with great patience, but to my dismay on the first day of release, I bought it and felt unimpressed. The great thing about Turn on the Bright Lights was the subtle varience in songs. I bought their first album on a whim, not knowing anything about them and it was a pleasent surprise. This album is a costant one note version of the same song. I love this band and I hope that they follow up with something that goes beyond the mediocraty of Antics. Nothing even comes close to the gentle beauty of NYC, will they do it next time?"
2,Drone on,"More droning noise from Interpol. I think i would like this more if the guitar and vocals weren't so loud. The rhythm section is the most interesting part of this band except it's often drowned in a swell of noisy lifeless guitars and monotone vocals. There are some songs that work, mainly tracks 3 and 8, but most of it is rather dull."
3,Diffrent Antics,"First Interpol record was incredible. Antics now is not good compared to first. I have new Interpol for now almost 4 months. The design of songs on new record not so evolving. But songs are sometimes release like Evil and Length of Love. No Cure or Smiths sound, Interpol sound otherwise. The live show serious wild and good times. Not so much Antics some and Bright Lights yes."
5,The Best CD Ever,Interpol is getting better there first cd i only like about 5 or 6 songs on it and there new cd i like every song on the cd. I would give the cd 20 out of 10.
3,I Like Antics,"Interpol, in my opinion, sing songs that are cinematic in scale yet melencholy and depressing. The band proves to be aware of their grasp they have on the darkly romantic style and use it to their advantage. ""Antics"" is in all honesty a good rock album. Some of the songs aren't very listenable and uncatchy like ""Not Even Jail"" and the boring ""A Time to be so Small."" Tracks like ""Narc"" and ""Take you on a Cruise"" share similar qualities. ""Evil"" is fine and so is ""Public Pervert"". ""No Exit"" is obviously one of thier finer songs on ""Antics"" as well as ""C'mere"" which is also their lightest. Still, it's nice to see a band so intuned with their dark and sometimes unsightly side. Nice effort."
5,No words to describe,"There are really no words to describe the journey that this music will take you through. I bought it and was just driving through the woods one day and I got so lost in this music. If you liked the first album, you will LOVE this one."
4,4.5 Stars.,"If you're gonna compare 'Antics' with 'Turn On The Bright Lights' please DON'T. These are two completely different albums even though from the same band. Their debut was more faster than 'Antics' with the same touch and taste of dark melody in it. This is a great record and the only reason why people don't seem to think so 'cos they're still comparing it to 'Turn On The Bright Lights'. It doesn't matter which album you get first, both of them are classics indeed."
4,"Interpol ""Antics""","""Next Exit"" (9/10)""Evil"" (10/10)""NARC"" (9/10)""Take You On A Cruise"" (9/10)""Slow Hands"" (10/10)""Not Even Jail"" (7/10)""Public Pervert"" (8/10)""C'mere"" (8/10)""Length Of Love"" (6/10)""A Time To Be So Small"" (7/10)Interpol delivers a great sophomore record in, ""Antics."" Though it starts to slip at the very end, tracks 1-8 are awesome and there's no skipping necesarry. Standouts include ""Evil,"" ""Slow Hands,"" and ""Take You On A Cruise.""Overall rating: 8.3 out of 10."
5,love it,I love retro sounding music these guys are good at it. I did not like their first album. I love this one.
2,i don't get all the hype,"I saw these guys open for the Cure and they were really good. but thats it... i've since heard these guys on the radio (my little sister plays that same damn song over and over and over... dude, enough!) and seen the videos. okay, they're....alright. his voice is more or less talking over the music so duran duran comparisons i think are unwarranted. however, i discoverd this band called Longwave. if you like these guys, check them out. the singer is way better and the sound is very similar."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZ,"Antics is incredibly disappointing. Interpol's first album was cool because it was dark, moody and dramatic. Now they have admittedly dropped that part of their sound and the result is just another The band. They should now be known as The Interpol. They're now just another band with a decent yet uninspiring album full of songs that all sound the same. This definitely goes on my list of most disappointing albums ever, and that's why it gets two stars instead of three."
3,Rip Off,"I hate to rate this album for I have only heard ""Slow Hands"" on the radio, but to me this band sounds like a Joy Division rip off. Anyone disagree?"
1,Don't confuse melancholy for art...,"I think a lot of people are fooled by Interpol. They see the suits and the music is a bit depressing. People tend to think that if something is depressing, it must be artistic (Oh, the tortured artiste!)""Antics"" is depressing because it's exactly what's wrong with alternative today. You have a site like Amazon that claims Green Day and U2 are the top alternative bands. Based on what? Record sales?Aestetically speaking, ""Antics"" is weak and appeals to the goth/shoegazer types that think anyone who whines about boring stuff along to some simplistic ""ethereal"" music is an artist.Yes, it is true that many artists led painful and depressing lives. But this doesn't correlate to great art... No. These guys are just another boring rock band, and maybe need to go to therapy and take some meds... But the black clothes and depression thing isn't artistic at all... unless you're in high school or something..."
2,Mostly filler,"""Evil"" is an incredible song. I'd never heard of this band until that incredibly moving, heartfelt tune came on the radio. The rest of the album is really forgettable - slow hands is passable, as are maybe 2 other songs. The rest is filler, sounds like it was written by robots. Dull. Give Turn on the Bright Lights a listen if you want to see what this band's capable of."
3,Dissapointing,"I have tried to get into this album and I can't. Let me say that I loved TOTBL, and while I don't expect them to put out an identical album, much of what I enjoyed about the first was removed. The euphoric guitar meldoies and vocal harmonies are non-existant on this album. Many of the songs sound like a failed stab at the mainstream. I give the album 3 stars for ""Next Exit"" and ""Take You On A Cruise."" I have faith that their next album will be much better."
5,Underated,"After Turn on the Bright Lights, Interpol had no where to go but down but this album can still hold its own. They've changed their sound quite a bit from TOTBL especially in Paul Banks vocals. If you ever get a chance to see this band live then do so because they are one of the greatest bands ive seen live."
4,Fast Hands,"I write as I listen to Slow Hands, and while it took a couple of listens for me to 'get' Antics, I'm now enamoured. Just as two years ago, Turn on... blew me away (my favourite guitar sound was back married with soul and passion), Antics has me in love with the band all over again.With Antics, the Frames 'Burn the Maps', anything by The Shins, Nick Cave's Abbatoir Blues and the Future Kings of Spain - your Musical Journey for 2004 is complete!"
3,It just didn't get me there,"When I got Turn on the Bright lights, I was instantly transported back to the 80's, but in a good way, not simply a retro grab. Much has already been said about how Interpol managed to blend Joy Division and Echo and the Bunny Men and even the Cars into a sound that is uniquely their own and I just LOVE that album. Antics just does not compare to that. I would feel much differently if Antics had been the first album and Bright Lights had come next. It is too much the same and not particularly interesting or compelling. Unfortunate because I couldn't wait for this album"
3,Failing to impassion....,"I want to say right off that this is not an atrocious album. Of course it's better than most of the rubbish you will hear! It's Interpol after all! That having been said, I have to say I'm just a teeny, eeny, weeny bit dissapointed. Where is the messy anquish of TOBL? That feeling of tumbling head first into an Alison in Wonderland like vortex of gloriously chaotic emotion?? Sorry, but it's the difference between aged cheddar and an overprocessed slice of American cheese. The vocal arrangements are a bit too accessible and spoon fed for my taste. It all feels very studio-ish. The first album conjured that feeling of a dark, smokey, gritty NYC club. The ""we produced this by the skin of our teeth"" edginess. Hey, I think Interpol are brilliant. There are some very fine songs on ""Antics"". ""Take You On A Cruise"", ""Evil"", ""Narc"" - but ""Slow Hands"" is beneath them in my opionion. What the heck, it's growing on me...."
1,"""Slow Hands"" is good, but...","I like the new Interpol album ""Antics"". Well I like one song, ""Slow Hands"" that they played at the homecoming dance. After shakin' my booty on the dance floor, I bought ""Antics"" and it made me feel sad.Since I only like one of the songs, I feel like I can only give this one star. If the review was for the single, it'd get a solid 3 stars."
1,Awful,"TOTBL was such a good record but this is just tuneless, mediocre crap.Shame, really.I haven't entirely given up on Interpol YET, but they definitely blew it this time. We all know style is important, but I can't help thinking that the pressure was too much to bear for them.The world was theirs for the taking and they just blew it.Sorry, boys - why don't you go write some SONGS next time? Nice suits, mind..."
4,good stuff,"Good band with definate influences following Joy division meets the Clash meets Depeche Mode sound. Basic musical structure. Guitars are basic, with above average base licks remenicent of Paul Simonon. Not bad live either. They onstage act from the members is a little repetative and boring but music is far from boring. To be more subjective I enjoy wilder onstage ""antics"" to accompany their antics album."
2,Inter..lol?,"Hummm...terrible thing...after third song my finger compulsively pushed the fast forward button....i mean i wanted to hear something decent but it was not until track Not Even Jail that i believed this was a mainstream band and not my neighbours jammin`.There are too many awful things here, like the cover,hey!...you`re paying 14$ and that includes a cover not a word office document.In TOBL they really delivered ,it was emotive raw and inspiring...but here this is a band on autopilot...There were many things to avoid from 80`s post punk music and Interpol recollect them all here,off key goat singing,uninspiring lyrics,repetitive guitar hooks.Each song sounds exactly the same dull and monotonous.If i give it 2 stars it`s because i like track Not Even Jail and i don`t want to see the time come when i rate an album 1 star.Somebody said this reminded him to Kitchens of Distinction.Auggh what an insult."
2,Falls Short,I first stumbled across Interpol during the buzz of Turn On The Bright Lights. I was very hesitant to buy into it because I've been constantly disappointed by most new music. After a few listens I realized that Interpol had something. The music was sparse and the melodies were sparser but there was just enough there to form a very enjoyable bunch of songs. There were some weak points but for the most part Interpol had found the right blend of ingredients to create a memorable album.Antics is a valiant attempt to utilize those same ingredients but it doesn't work.The songs don't have the simple hooks that TOTBL had. There are a few songs that come close like C'mere and Slowhands but even those songs are only as good as the weakest stuff on Bright Lights. I was hoping for better because it's really time a modern band started producing some consistently good music... Still waiting.
1,I'll say it now.,"Why does this chubby face kid keep trying to tell Rosemary and Sandy what is wrong with their lives? Hey, I know... maybe it's because their own stories are boring & stuff.On behalf of Stella and the others, I give this album 0 stars.=A="
1,*Yawn* Boring,The first one had some ok songs but this is just repetative drivel. Why people croon over these preppy pretty boys like girls at a beatles concert I don't know. They don't hold a candle to other bands in the genre. I agree with the guy who said stick with Killing Joke. They are the real deal. Buy Killing Joke's Night Time album instead of this. It will be more worth your time. Or Tones On Tails' Everything album. Educate thyself!
3,devil's advocate,"I can't really review the album, seeing as I've only heard the two singles ""slow hands"" and ""evil"", so i gave it an average rating. I can say that these two songs sound remarkably alike, and also remarkably like 50% of the new breed of alternative music on the radio. I've read enough to think that this band is being hailed as the king of the shoegazing moping art kids with fancy haircuts.And does anyone else think that the bassline from evil is very very similar to ""smells like teen spirit?"""
1,BAD!!!,this has got to be the worset album ever and i olny bought because evil and slow hands were good and they were the olny good songs on the album there wasent even an ok song insteed of those two i ended up giving it to one of my friends
4,"All of you ""music"" snobs please leave Amazon","I have grown tired of seeing every decent new band that comes out being bashed by these so called ""geniuses"" of music. This band sounds like Joy Division, this band is derivative, this band is an 80's punk rip-off, etc.I was alive and old enough to listen to and appreciate Joy Division, Violent Femmes, old REM, New Order, etc. Yes Interpol does sound like them, but what band doesn't draw from previous generations? What about Oasis and the Beatles? Their music is better than anything out there today. I don't watch MTV -- it is all hip hop and reality TV --- I saw them on the previous Cure tour and thought they had a good sound. Are they better than their predecessors? I can't say that as all music is completely relative. It depends on what mood one is in to determine what is considered good music. Interpol is a good ""new"" band. If you want to bash something move over to the Justin Timberlake, Britney Spears area."
4,"A fast paced mystery that has you playing ""the game"".","""The Game of Thirty"" is a well written and enthralling mystery that blends a wide array of characters into a wonderful whodunnit. Ancient Egyptian artifacts, New York jewelers and pedophiles make this a read you can't put down"
1,Not one of my better purchases,"Worked fine for 3 months, but no more. I only wore it to work where I sit at a desk all day. I'm not going to pay to ship it out plus a $10 check to get it fixed. It's going in the trash. I should have known better buying a watch from some company I've never heard of. Perhaps I got one of the lemons. The more affordable Timex is next and should have been my first choice."
4,Scratches beware,"I purchased the watch as I have a child with severe ADHD. I use it to trigger him to begin packing his books at 5 minutes before his classes end so that he is not the last one out and last one in the next class. It does help keep him focused. and It notifies him when it is time for his afternoon medications. Only reason i do not rate this a 5 is that there is no raised bumper around the crystal. My Timex's crystal is ""embedded within"" the watch facing' thus the tendenacy is to hit that and not the crystal. My son is rather oblivious to things, he's has the watch for only roughly 2 months now, and the crystal is horribly scratched as ""boys will be boys."" I would recommend future designs follow the lead of the Timex ""Ironman"" regarding the embedded crystal. The product is supurb in all other senses."
4,vibrating watch,"I bought this watch to wake me up in the morning, due to my hearing impairment. It does the job for that, unless I was really tired and then, I'd not feel the vibration.I didn't buy the watch for its looks, in which it ain't pretty. The display is somewhat coarse (not high resolution), but it's functional. I don't wear watches, except to sleep with for the wakeup call, so it doesn't matter.If you want a vibrating watch for a wakeup, and not a heavy sleeper, this should work for you."
4,The tip falls off!,"I use to have a poker that was solid...nothing screwed on; and it worked great. This poker is ok for the price but I'm going to use it as a spare and look for another solid one. I was using it and the tip came unscrewed and fell in the fire. It's good if you need it every once in a while, but if you are going to use it for a lifetime, don't bother. It will not last forever."
5,Missy Elliot and Jean Grae cannot be compared,"When I first listened to ""Taco Day,"" I had no idea what to expect. My friend had recommended it to me and since then I have been a devout Jean Grae fan. I continued to search for any songs of Jean Grae that I could get my hands on and when I bought ""Attack of the Attacking Things"" and, more recently, ""The Bootleg of the Bootleg EP,"" I was far from disappointed. Jean Grae has emerged as the smartest new rapper in recent years; her two cds prove that. Her intelligent words should speak to nearly everyone and though some songs, like the previously mentioned ""Taco Day,"" may shock listeners, her words provide a healthy balance of relaxing flows and intelligent lyrics. Anyone interested in a new perspective (that crushes the belief that female emcees can't rap and only survive because of their looks) should definitely buy this album."
4,Even thought it's a EP it's her best,I feel she was better when she did this little EP back in 2002/2003 then her newest album. I think she is probally one of the best 10 best femcees of all time and should get more airplay and this album is great lyically and is better then her new LP. If your a new Jean Grae fan start out here
3,c'mon people...it's not THAT good,"catchy indie nerd pop from the mid-80's. yeah, so it never caught on and yeah, so mitch easter produced a lot of great music. still, that's no reason to fall all over oneself singing hosannas about these albums/this cd. it's melodic and enjoyable, but ultimately a little forgettable. not sure why all the fanboyism with all these user reviews. maybe 40+ people fondly remembering their college years in the early 80's, or maybe people just love an underdog. who knows.anyway, if you never heard this band 20+ years ago and aren't a huge fan of nerdy white college rock from the 80's, i would venture to say you'll be underwhelmed. it's not like this is the beatles or the kinks."
3,Very Basic Intro to Digital Photography,"I was hoping for a little more detail and insight into digital photography; this is a very basic guide. One of my complaints is that in a field that quickly changes, why people are still selling books that are this dated? Much of the info and the cameras examples given are a few years old and better guides/introductions to the field are now available. I am not saying this book sucks, or is a complete waste of time, since some of the information is good and useful. All I'm saying is books like this should not be sold as if it is the latest guide on the subject matter. Be more forthcoming on how old the material is. I blame the seller and not the author. This is an ""OK"" title at best and I would recommend a different title or a revised edition if available."
1,Stay far away!,"I opened the product, loaded songs, and right when I pushed the button to turn it on, the button broke and jammed inside the player...What a peice of junk."
1,Unusable Poor Design,This thing is totally unusable. The body of it is too wide for the USB connector to fit into my PC! On my PC there is a bit of an inset around the USB port. The neck of this unit doesn't reach deep enough into that inset. Stupid design. ....update....I just looked on the Nextar website and I guess I would have to pay $10 for an extension cord to plug this into my PC. *sigh*...
1,Worthless! Buyer Beware,This product did nothing except waste two hours of my life trying to install it to my computer. IT NEVER WORKED AT ALL!
1,A BIG RIP OFF,Apart from Dry Cry (#15)featuring Sizzler this is the WORSE CD I have ever paid hard earned money for. Fortunately I had Dry Cry on another CD so I threw this one in the garbage.
4,Why The Hate?,"I loved this remix album, and felt alot, if not most, of these ""new"" songs were better than the originals - especially tracks 2-4 and 8-10."
5,WOW,"wow this new rapper has some talent.....after listening to this cd i thought ""wow this cd is the greatest"". this a great cd especially when this is Tupacs Dubut CD and its off the hook....Tupac i Think could be the nexted big rapper....he could be up there with Chingy, Lil Jon for the Greatest rappers ever....GREAT CD"
1,this CD is free on Kazaa!!!,7 minutes later I'm listening to something I wouldnt ever pay for... thank you kazaa
2,Damn,"Damn, the only decent track on this is Life Goes On, all the others suck! The music doesn't even sound right.If 2Pac were alive today to hear this he'd go and knock Suge out."
1,The worst album ever,"seriuosly. now if this was like Greatest Hits Vol.02, i'd get it sincei LOVE all the songs on this cd, and it's the only reason i got this album. so thank you very much for ruin real klassics."
1,No Tracks Left,"The mileage Suge Knight got out of tracks recorded by 2Pac ranks up with the ""new"" releases of Jimi Hendrix, Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly years after their deaths.The game comes crashing down with Nu-Mixx Klazzics, a cheap means to re-release previously-issued cuts. There are classic tracks, but the new mixes are absolute garbage.The legacy left in his much too short recording career of 2Pac can never be tarnished, no matter how his music is manipulated and twisted by others."
1,5 Starz for 2 Pac'z work......0 starz for thiz CD,Mo remix'z for Tupac'z songz....man...when are theze people gonna leave Tupac'z songz alone...Itz disrespectful!!! Dumazz people stealin hiz money...I suggest you to burn the cd instead of buyin it cuz if you buy it...you are supportin Suge Knight'z fat azz and feedin hiz fat azz more food...go buy Tupac'z old albumz because the remixez need to stop and the originalz are alott betta....dont buy thiz cd and dont buy resurrection cuz thiz one supportz the the biggest loser's known az Eminem and 50 Cent...Dumazz people betta leave Pac alone n stop messin up hiz muzik >:-(+ R.I.P. Tupac Shakur +
1,pac should stick 2 the originalz,"man...2 begin with, we all know 2pac is the greatest rappper of all time, and always will be. but this cd is disgraceful. the remixes are horrible, and will never surpass the originals. (...)"
1,GARBAGE,Look anyone who is giving this cd good reviews has no respect for Pac. I didnt buy this crappp cuz i knew better. I heard it though and it just proved me right. This cd is garbage becuz Pac would be disgraced if he knew his name was behind this sh*t. It ruins some great classic songs and is just another way for the man who had Pac killed to make money off of him. This cd is as weak as Suge.
1,Respect Tupac And Do Not Buy This,"Hearing Tupac's classic songs get butchered by Suge Knight makes me sick. The song that I hate the most is the stupid remix of ""2 Of America's Most Wanted"". Some loser called Crooked I raps over Snoop Dogg's parts and Tupac's lyrics that mention Snoop Dogg are deleted. The only reason Suge keeps on releasing these Tupac albums with ""new"" material is so he can fill his pockets even more and try to keep Death Row Records afloat. I'm betting good money that Tupac hates that this is going on. Respect Tupac and buy his classic albums and not this attempt at easy money from Suge Knight."
1,SHAME ON YOU DEATH ROW,Death Row should be ashmed of themselves. screwing up the classic songs jus to make money. I WOULDNT EVEN TAKE IT FOR FREEDONT BUY IT
2,How bad do you want this,"Since Tupac is my favorite rapper I had to get this. I guess I expected it to be disappointing, repetitive, and even corny. Well, I was right. I gave it two stars because the lyrics are from his older songs, which were and are still amazing. The beats are more modern and extremely corny. Honestly, If you like Tupac don't get this. This is just another way for them to make money off the legend."
1,He must be turning in his grave.......,"Dont Bother. Weak Beats mixed over some of Pac's finest, i couldnt even listen to them fully, those 30 sec clips on amazon were more than enough. Wish people would stop gettin rich off him and ruining his songs. Download ""the realest killaz"" feat 50 cent, thats a killer pac remix"
2,Not Feelin it...,"okay... 2pac is a legend. these are remixes of his legendary songs. one question.... WHY?!!! why would you remix these songs? there classics. I can see remixing unreleased songs to give it that feeling that 2pac is still with us. But these songs are classics. we heard them already. did you see the commercial for this. im 99.9 % sure that they did that to be funny but that .1% of me says somethin cause does everyone still look the same after 7 years. call me an idiot but i dont know. anyways dont support death row just because they want money. if your a real 2pac fan go get his other cds like all eyes on me, this is for my nigggas, hell even get better days. This is just something thrown together for a quick doller. Get the Resurrection Soundtrack coming soon it looks good. The only reason i gave this 2 stars is because it is 2pac and he is great. RIP Tupac Amaru Shakur"
2,WHAT IS SUGE THINKING?!?!?!?!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I've heard a lot of this album on deathrow and it was getting hyped and so was I and I'm sure every 2Pac fan was as well but the lyrics are classic but these beats are straight trash there may be like 2 good songs in my opition it would have to be ""Life Goes On"" and ""Ambitionz Az A Ridah"" but I perfer the originals and one question WHY!!??? IS ""HIT 'EM UP"" censored? and that beat is straight up trash makes it sound like a love ""diss"" song...well if you don't want to be disappointed in how deathrow ended up to be these dayz don't pick this one up my advice pick up ""The 7 Day Theory"",""All Eyez On Me"" ""Greatest Hits"" or ""Me Aganist The World"" 2Pac at his BEST!"
1,"Sorry Pac, I know your turnin in your grave for this",Yo Nu-Mixx sux i hate when people make cd's like this to make some money off of great artist like Pac. This cd is disrespecting Pac and nobody should get this if your a Pac fan. They take great songs and make crappy beats. Get this if you want to support Pac haters or waste your money.
2,What The.......,"Imma real Pac fan but i have 2 say that is cd is below average. How can they replace Snoop for CROOKED I?? I'll admit crooked I verse is okay but its NO WHERE AND I MEAN NO WHERE COMPARED 2 SNOOP""S PART! Da Only 2 songs that i can rate as a 10 is Toss It Up And Heartz Of Men because they are better than the Originals Now as the rest of the songs, The Originals are WAY better than these remixes. Damn SUge! U needed money that bad??? Just go find a talented rapper, sign him/her than make money off of them ok?"
1,Not even worth the Time.,This CD is TERRIBLE. Suge is just trying to make money off 2pac's music. Here is a review of the bad songs on the cd:2 of Americaz Most Wanted-They took Snoop out and replaced him with weak (...)Crooked I.How Do you want it-Beat is weak.Hail Mary-Suge just completely (...)Up this Song. The beat is very very WACK.Life Goes On-Again a bad beat to Pac's good song.All Eyez On Me-This beat messed up the song.Heartz Of Men-Suge just completely (...)up this song as well.Toss It Up-Like I said before the beat is bad.Hit 'em Up-The real version is way better. How do you take the F word out of a diss song.The beat doesn't even sound right to me.Never had a friend like me-The beat to me is bad.Ambitionz Az A Ridah-I liked the real version better than this one. The regular beat was better.Lyrics 9/10(2pac's lyrics only)Production 0/10I give this 1 star. I'm glad 2pac's mother got his unrealesed music.
1,"Bury him a G, and stop trying to make G's off him...","This is perhaps the worst of all the posthumous releases to be put on the market by Tha Row with Tupac as it's only reason for existence. No new songs. No new lyrics. The beats are new, but hold a fizzled out match to the nuclear explosiveness of the originals. These beats sound like they were made by two guys who have filled their ears with cotton and added fuzzy pink ear muffs to further drown out their sense of good music. If Pac wasn't cremated, he'd not only roll in his grave, but roll up a blunt in his grave so he could settle his nerves. Only one word seems fitting for this release : GARBAGE. At most, it makes a great coaster for your beer mug.One"
1,*Do Not Buy This Album*,"If you are a true 2pac fan, stay clear of this album. This album is Death Row raping 2pacs most classic songs. What made these songs classics partly WAS the beats. Its sickening how Suge Knight tries to squeeze every last penny he can out of 2pacs legacy. I have heard this album, and it may be one of the worst things i've heard, I AM NOT overegagerating. Peace."
3,Crap Reviewer's,"I admit this is not the best album in the world but what is 'ILL WILL' on about OF COURSE this is gonna be old songs remixed with new beats hence 'NU MIXXES' what did you expect you donut, talk about stating the obvious, and as for 'DUBS ON DUBS' where have you been fool if you ain't heard of Crooked I you can't listen to rap, i bet your'e a POP RAP lover Ja Rule,2 Pac and Will Smith. I suggest you pick up a copy of WESTCOASTANOSTRA and then tell me he can't rap."
5,2pac's greatest,"Although all of the songs are simply remixed with different beats, the cd still deserves 5 stars. Everyone's mad about how suge knight is just trying to make money off of pac, but if he didn't do that, there wouldnt be any new pac material. I like most of the originals better, besides ""life goes on"" and ""heartz of men"". But at least it's 2pac, and they are all sweet songs. Peace"
2,best 2pac cd eva cept fo 3 problemz so dats -3 starz,i luv 2pac like u do. dis is his best cd eva but therez 3 problemz 1.1 song stinx 2.one song on the chorus he cussez 2 much 3.the coverz a lil 2 pimped out - lol jus kiddin bout no 3.but dis is tha best 2pac cd eva. every song is good cept for 2 well 1 of doz 2 is ok its da black album jay -z a lil betta den dat qualite. get dis ghettoo survivaz and soljaz like me. also 2pac resurection soundtrack is not az good as dis. all eyez on me is almost as good as dis. dis b a lil betta doe cuz the songz rok.
3,NOT ALL THAT BAD!!!!,I have not heard any other song on this album except the Life Goes ON mix. I read numerous reviews saying that is was the worst track and BAD production. I think the new beat they have on Life GOES ON nu mixx is SO KILLER!!! I wish I couod get the instrumental
3,It's Okey,"This ALBUM is OKEY I Think. It has about 3 good songs, So I GAVE IT 3 STARZ. it takes snoop out of the 1st song, which I DON'T LIKE"
2,Nu-Mixx Klazzics,"I have one big reason I do not like this album: They took some awesome songs, and messed with them and made them sound bad!makes me mad"
1,Save your money,"This cd just sucks, some of 2pac's greatest works are ruined by beats that just aren't meant to go with these songs, I think this CD is a disgrace and Pac probably isn't happy with Suge still making dollars off his stuff. Don't buy this album, maybe buy the new Resurrection, that could be good when it's out. I think the 2 songs I've heard so far, the one with Biggie (Runnin' - produced by Eminem), and the other with Em and the Outlawz, are decent tracks. Just don't buy this caaarrrrraaap of a cd it's bad."
2,nu mixx klassics,"Its a shame, we were lookin 4ward 2 sum phat new beats 2 sum classic 2pac tunes, all we got was sum washed up pop meldoies, 2pac wud neva allow such S*** 2 be released on hes name, suge is a fool 4 tryin 2 sell 2pacs soul 4 a few dollars, aint no love in da fast lane, ya heard !!!!!!!"
2,A money spinner or a true effort?,"OK so i was slightly sceptical about buying this CD. How can anyone take 2pacs best and greatest songs from the past years, and remix them without him being here? Although there are 2/3 good remixes (life goes on, ambitionz az a ridah) the rest of the album lets it down, leaving it to fall flat on its face. I think Suge Knight is just looking to cash in on pacs name. As for the rest of the album, the majority of the tracks have been completley bodged (hit em up, all eyez on me, hail mary) which made me break out the Greatest Hits CD again, and made me appreicate them more. Id say this is for only the 2pac fan with all other albums, but wouldnt reccomend it for the new fan."
2,WHAT!,"CD is only gets stars for 2Pac's lyric, additional rappers added on is TALENTLESS. Deathrow is TALENTLESS. The production of beats is untolerable. It sounds like some korny techno music, it ruined classics like 2 of Amerikaz Most wanted, and Hit Em Up, what is this, whoever made this just wanted to make some money, after 2PAC is dead, these ppl just jack off of the man. Bonnie & Clyde 03, Can't Deny it, Way Of Life, Street Dreams...the list goes on, no matter how hard they try, THEY CAN't BEAT THE ORIGINAL!"
1,THIS ALBUM IS WAK,"This album is nothing but a weak a** atempt to convert Tupac's Old School beats to New School ones. Theres nothing but alot of stupid a** rappers on here who ""envy"" Tupac AND THIS IS THEIR STUPID CHANCE TO BE IN THA SPOTLIGHT. I think if Tupac were alive he'd be outraged at this stupid sh*t. Tupac isn't techno or new school. I think Suge Knight should be ashamed at himself and these wak a** Dj's who has never heard of Tupac. These 19 and 18 year old djs who hav only heard, Resurrection or Better Dayz, who don't understand wat old school was.These New School cats who hav only heard of Memphis Bleek or Loon or any other stupid a** rappers who's only way to fame is their beats and not their words. As for this album i hope it fails on the music charts because its nothing but a failier!!!! {{{oo}}}"
3,It is okey....,"Come on! This CD isn't THAT bad! It is not an awesome CD, but this is still a good 2Pac album. Give it a chance"
2,Download This Album,"I cannot believe I actually rated a Tupac CD under four stars. Death Row obviously is cashing in on this one. It's bad enough his music is butchered before it sees mainstream release, guest spots are taken out, and newer rappers are being used to replace, and I suppose appeal to a new audience? Anyway, this CD is horrible, the ebats are not ""bangin"" as others have decribed them, in fact, most of them are lame. The original songs were as Tupac saw them fit, otherwise he would have changed them before putting them out. To remix his classic songs, the ones made while he was still alive, is a blatant shot in the face. Don't support Suge's pocketbook, download this album, or just listen to the original CD instead, its a lot better."
1,A SHAMEFUL ATTEMPT TO CASH IN ON 2PAC.,Afeni shakur or whoever else is responsible for releasing this cd should be ashamed of themselves.This cd was made only to make the people I just mentioned more money.The songs are ruined by adding horrible beats to them.Stay away also from that new cd featuring biggie and pac which was produced by eminem or 50 cent.STOP GIVING THESE GREEDY RECORD PRODUCERS YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!!
1,Out of respect for Pac....Don't buy,"This gets 1 star because Pac's name is on it.I love every Tupac CD ever, but i can't find a single good song on here.Suge just wanted to get some money off the name of Tupac while he still could.Only buy this to complete a collection, if your looken for good music just get the Tupac:Resurrection Soundtrack or Jay-Z's new and last cd The Black AlbumPeace"
2,good music only when on drugs,"i listened to this cd last night for the first time while i was on lsd and shrooms. I know all the songs in there regular version but hearing them and not knowing they were a remix freaked me out. I thought i was goin nuts man. But i eventually realized they were remixes and had a good laugh. ha ha ha. Well it was interesting while i was trippin, but listenlin to these mixes sober is irritating. Stick to the real songs."
1,Dont buy 2pacs Nu mixx Klazzics,"I spent $15.14 on 2pac's Nu Mixx Klazzics cd. The album simply has 10 tracks of his old classic songs. The lyrics are original, but the beat is different. All of the beats carry the same vibe and I'm not digging it. For all 2pac fans out there who are looking towards buying this album, invest it on another cd."
4,Four Stars For Pac,"This CD was all right. The beats were surprisingly cluttered, not the Death Row style at all. The beat to Toss it Up sounds almost exactly the same as the original one. The best tracks were Never Had a Friends Like Me (which was better than the original), Ambitionz az a Ridah, and Hail Mary. I find it sort of disrespectful to Pac that they bleep him out every time he says Snoop Dogg's name in 2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted. I gave this album four stars because it's 2Pac; no matter how weak most of the beats were, his amazing lyrics save the album. Almost no artist could make an album as good as the albums that 2Pac made (besides 2Pacalypse Now, and the poorly remixed R U Still Down?) so even though this album doesn't fall in with the top five 2Pac albums, it'll be one of the better CDs of 2003."
5,BANGIN PAC CD FROM THA ROW,"IF YALL HAVENT GOT THIS CD YET, YOU SHOULD GO COP. THIS IS A VERY GOOD CD. I DO GIVE THE DEATH ROW PRODUCERS AN APPLAUSE FOR THEIR GOOD WORK WITH THIS CD. I DO FEEL ANY TRACKS THAT 2PAC DID WITH THA ROW SHOULD BE DONE BY THE ROW AND NO ONE ELSE. I THINK THE LIFE GOES ON REMIX FITS PAC SO PERFECTLY. BUT ALL IN ALL, THE TRACKS ARE GOOD. BE SURE TO PEEP THE 1ST TRACK WITH CROOKED I, WHO IS ONE TO WATCH FOR IN THE GAME. GO BUT THIS ALBUM!!! CLASSIC"
2,let 2pac live!,"i gave this cd a quick listen to a couple weeks ago. frankly the majority of remixes are just pointless. ""how do you want it remix"" was good but much of the rest is another stupid move by suge knight. but this cd does get 2 stars for the sake of one song: ""2 of amerikaz most wanted remix"" with crooked i. that song is so bangin. everyone should bump that one reaaaaal loud. crooked i was a good replacement for a snitch like snoop dogg and the beat is the best i've heard from the new row. but overall, don't waste $18-$20 on this disasterpiece."
1,1 star only because it's Pac,DO NOT BUY THIS...This is nothing but another attempt for Suge's dumba#s to make a buck off of Pac.This is about as respectful as mixing Pac with Wyclef Jean...
2,I'M OUTRAGED!!!.... But I HAD 2 Buy It.,"I am thoroughly ticked off at Deathrow for making me buy this rip off of an album. Pac is my ALL TIME Favorite rap artist, and I buy EVERY cd that bares his name. But I found out that everyting with his name on it is not good. I thought it was going to be striaght hardcore material...but Suge made Pac seem like Nelly with these pop beats. Yall could have atleast had Johnny ""J"" do the beats. I hate it when Deathrow puts artists that didn't know Pac on songs with him. MAN, They made feel I could be on 2Pac's tracks too (LOL). The producers were WACK on like, 8 out of ten tracks. The only songs that I liked were ""Life Goes On"" and ""Toss It Up"". The song's beats were just GARBAGE. Suge needs to chill out with the PAC stuff. Do something else and stop misleading PAC TRUE Fans. OUT!!"
1,Junk,"I am a die hard tupac fan since 94 and this cd is a disgrace to him. At least his unreleased tracks were from him and not some lame ass remix to his old songs. I don't know what the ""Row"" was thinking about this. Just milking money off us true pac fans. I would have bought it but my boy bought it and after listening to it, I felt bad he wasted 15 dollars on it. Original songs are better. Why mess with perfection anywayz."
1,Leave the man alone.,"Tupac and his memory need to be left alone. Death Row's only income comes from butchering tupac songs and making fun of Snoop and Dre. They have no real talent (except Kurupt)and any TRUE Tupac fan wouldn't think twice about buying this cd. Wait till records come out on his label, Amaru, to get old, untouched material."
1,REAL Pac Fan,"Trust me... the album is garbage... and even if it was tight, you should cop a bootled from your neighborhood pagershop... why you gonna put more tupac money in suge knight's pocket like that... let us not forget het killed pac... u know i'm right... Just get it on the internet man! HOLLA!!"
1,1 star is even too much for it!!!!,"SH_TY ALBUM! NOT EVEN CROOKED I COULD SAVE THE FIRST TRACK> THEY MUFFLE THE LINE ""DOG< MY F""IN HOMEY"" TO ELIMIBNATE THE FACT THAT SNOOP WAS ORIGINALLY ON THE TRACK> IF YOU WANT A COMEDY ALBUM THOUGH>>>DEFINITELY GET THIS CD! SO MANY GREAT REMIXERS< PRODUCERS< AND DJS OUT THERENONE OF THEM WERE PICKED FOR WORK ON THIS CD"
1,Album Is Weak,"the album sucks, but no this is not from deathrow. this is from koch records, they bought the right to make a mix of this from tupacs mother. death row wouldnt throw cheap junk like this"
1,No Pac No Stars given on this,I need my money back no stars given Pac is my overall favorite rapper on the west but not this Suge what is this....Did you bob your head when they were making this????? I know The Great Afeni Shakur has nothing to do with this. I mean I love Suge Knight and Death Row but why was this released I like the CD case though good designs
3,COME ON!!! YOU CANT REMIX CLASSICS!!!,"Still trying to bank off tupac?!? Give it up! He is passed away. Why would they even attempt to remix these classics?? Give me a break, they were fine the way they were! Just buy the original albums and thats all u need! Only reason I gave it 3 stars was because 5 for 2pac and 1 star for the remix idea! Dont bother!"
2,"Cute enough, but too loose","I like the look of the sandal, but had to poke extra holes in the strap because apparently it's only made for very large people. It still feels loose and floppy, though."
5,an amazing collection of foxtrot,"I've always loved foxtrot. They're funny, witty and sensational. this book is no different.100% recommended!"
1,THROW PIES AT THE FOXTROTS!,"I'm one of the few people who don't like the Foxtrots. They all have heads shaped like mittens or oven mits and I think the characters are tired cliches. Stinky Jason is the brain and bubble headed Paige is the fluff brained girl preoccupied with malls, make up and making out. The characters don't appeal to me and I don't like the way these mitten heads are drawn. THROW PIES AT THE FOXTROTS! THROW DARTS AT JASON!"
2,This game is a disappointing dud.,"This chess set looks great in pictures, but it's awful in person. The board is cardboard (like a Monopoly board), and for storage, you get a cheap, soft, molded plastic casing (that the pieces fit into), and this slides into a cardboard sheath. My other complaint is that the silver pieces are all good guys, and the gold pieces are all bad guys. In regular chess, there isn't a good side and a bad side, so I don't understand the company's choices for chess men. Don't buy this until you see it in person, because it isn't worth it."
3,Deceptive photo,"I ordered this particular set because the picture looked like it had a wooden board but when it came it have the cheep cardboard folding board. Now I realize it is not an expensive set but the pictures of other sets (which turn out to be the same one)showed that they had the flat board. To take a picture that is deceptive is poor business. Will I keep it yes because it is what my child asked for as a gift for Christmas, but I was very disappointed in this sites deceptive picture."
1,lord of rings chess set,i was so disappointed with the quality of this game. the board is a folded piece of cardboard and in the pictures it looked like a real board with some depth to it. the figures are very light weight material also...
2,Could have been better pieces.,I love of the Lord of the Rings but I was a bit disappointed with this chess set.For one thing: How come the rooks are not towers? They could have used the The White Tower of Gondor and the enemy's Black Tower of Mordor or Isengard's Tower.The ringraith should not have been made the queen but rather the knight. Also Arwen should have been made a knight because she was on the horse with Frodo in the movie. I'm not sure who the black queen should be since there are no females on the dark side in the Fellowship of the ring. However they could have used the female giant spider named Shelob from the Return of the King.The trolls as bishops are big and difficult to move.I think the goblins as pawns and the hobbits as pawns were cool.I think the pieces all look fine. I just wish they had used a few different pieces and maybe have the troll bishops be smaller.
3,"Not the complete ""Fellowship"".","The over all Look of the set was nice. The main problem, however, is that the seven ""Fellowship"" characters were not all present. Four important characters were missing. The Elf ""Legolas"", ""Pippin"" and ""Mary"" the two best friends of Frodo, and the dwarf ""Gimli"" all were forgotten. A complete disappointment. And the pawns are all in the same image of ""Sam"", Frodo's side-kick, in which place they could put other Hobbits. Particularly ""Bilbo"" the Hobbit that started it all. If your going to call the set ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", the least you can do is have the complete Fellowship. For the price of this set, I'm disappointed in the quality and authentisity. If the Other chess set wasn't outragiously expensive, or the price of this set was more appropriate for the quality, then I'd be more satisfied."
4,A Great Buy,"I absolutely love this chess set. The pieces, even though they are made of plastic, are very intricately detailed and look as if they are tarnished gold and silver. Just looking at the set makes it look like an antique. Any Lord of the Rings collector should have this.The only downside of the chess set is that there are a few characters from the books and movies that are not pieces. For example, Gimli, Legolas, Pippin, etc are not featured. This disappointed me a tiny bit, yet I know there were only so many pieces that could be made. Also, the troll piece is too big for its square and while the pieces are close together, its a bit hard to maneuver.All in all though, a very nice chess set, with beautiful pieces. Very fun!"
3,I EXPECT Better...,"First of all (zduckett), pawns are suppossed to be all the same design/look - although, its' not entirely crazy I quess, to have two diff. (at most) chararters, of same type/species. But, as for a [$$] price tag -- fm a large company like Hasbro - Customers SHOULD expect reasonably high QUALITY (NOT plastic pieces), and a little better design (yes the board is very nice), afterall there is nothing electronic here."
3,Groovin' The Night Away,"Steve Ferrone has played with the who's who in the music industry............from the Average White Band to Eric Clapton to Duran Duran (that's him on the song ""Notorious"")to his current gig with Tom Petty & the Heartbrakers. Steve has done it all & he grooves like nobodies business. Cool version of the Steely Dan classic ""Josie"". Recommended."
5,Great collector's item,This has a lot of different packs in it so it makes it a good value. According to my star wars price guide it is worth a little more than what amazon is asking for which is always a + I personally dont know how to play the card game and havent opened mine b/c I like to collect star wars stuff! Good deal!
3,XCOM email game,"I think I bought this well after the game had peaked in popularity and died out. Never used it, but I keep it 'mint in box' as a relic of an era gone by. Loved the original XCOM UFO Defense and XCOM Terror from the Deep."
4,Could use work,"Great quality fabric, looks nice, doesnt look cheap, The stamp is great, and is clearly stamped. Cant wait to get started on this, however only downfall I can see, I think the way the thread is done can use work. Took an hour to separate all the colors"
2,"year of flowers, stamped embroidery kit","It arrived very quickly, but I was unhappy with the product because I thought I was purchasing an embroidery kit, not a cross stitch kit. I was frustrated with what I received and came online to see if I simply overlooked that the description was indeed cross stitch, but to no avail. There is nothing on the webpage that gives the slightest impression that this product is a cross stitch item."
1,doesn't work..,I paid too much for a product that does not work.. at all.. nada .. nothingsave your money and try something else.
4,Currently published as Whirlpool by Elizabeth Lowell,"Ann Maxwell's books are currently being re-printed with new titles under the name Elizabeth Lowell. So if you are looking for some of these older titles, search under that author. Titles won't match, but hopefully the description will let you know which older title it is. The books are excellent and I would highly recommend them."
3,Ok replacements in six pack,"Pros: Cost Effective and a sticker to remind you when to replace the filter.Cons: These replacement filters are a little larger than the original ones, so you may have problems with the gap between the filter outlet and the bottle. With these you must drip one or two cups of water through them to remove small particles of charcoal that can clog the filter outlet. It can take ten to twenty minutes for the flow to increase enough for use. Then you boil them for five minutes to sterilize them."
3,necessary,"gotta have these for your distiller to properly function.3-stars because: the price on the filters has almost Doubled in just a few years without any improvements. also, i'm sure the designers could've made the filter somewhat larger so that it not only does a better job at filtering, but Lasts longer. guess they're making their money this way."
4,"A Good BC Album, but not their best","I got this album during a big buy up of BC in 1999 as Australia, never heard of BC after the ""Crossing"". I listened to it several times and thought Seven Waves was a definate hit and if BC ever release a best of hits this would have to be on there, but even so I love it, and still play it over and over. Pity they never put it on their live double album ""Come up Screaming"", it would have been a blast. The re-hashes of ""Were not in Kansas"" which is bit ,more grittier then ""No Place Like Home (NPLH)"" version and ""Ships"" is a better than it's previous version on ""NPLH"". ""Alone"", is a catchy and was the one they released from the album (as I believe). This album is good but not one of their better recordings, but if your into BC, get you won't be dissapointed."
5,Great way to have your child create a book about himself/herself,"My mother-in-law bought this for my son to complete when he was in second or third grade. It asks a variety of opportunities to respond to prompts such as Freckles I don't wear freckles I do wear freckles I think I have about _____freckles. Have you seen my foot! It is this big.....(it provides a large space for the child to trace his/her foot. It has some fun Dr. Seuss silliness that my son enjoys. The spaces to be completed are check marks, circles, one word, one sentence, and drawings. There is a section in the back for longer a piece of writing. (2 pages) This was perfect for my son because it wasn't overwhelming."
5,"I look through it once a year, and it still thrills me!","I love this book. I think that the authors really have done it this time. They have shown kids that they are somebody, and not just with a vague image. They have shown them by using every detail, and the child realizes on his/her own what a wonderful person he/she is. I really love it. And I would recommend it to anybody with children. Even teens would love it. It is wonderful."
4,My Book about Me,Our daughter received this book from her Grandparents 20 years ago. I purchased the same book for our Grandchildren. There eyes lit up when they saw their picture on the front of the book. Great book and lots of fun.
5,my book about me,"as a child i loved this book and my children all three have enjoyed it also. It's a blast to do with your child and if you make a point of doing one a year you can make a fabulous library that not only they will enjoy but also their children will love. the best way to buy a toy or a book, i have found is to find something that i loved as a child, if its still around then someone doing something right."
5,personal,We have not added our own personals to this item yet but it is a great book with lots of fun things to add and make personal
5,A historical record,This is a great book that I have been buying for almost 40 years for gifts. Looking back on what a child wrote years ago when he/she becomes an adult is really a treat.
5,GREAT book!,My six yr old just rec'd this book for her birthday. She is thrilled and eager to complete the book. We will treasure this book always. I'm going to purchase several myself to give as gifts.
5,A book to treasure,My grandson age 8 got this book when he was youger and granddaugter age 5 loves to read it every night. She just loves it. I got her one so she could have her own book. It's a book that the child and parents will treasure. It's well worth the money.
1,Worse Product,There was writing inside the entire book. I bought this book to use with my Kindergarteners. There is no way I can use a book that has writing all over the parts that should be left blank for the students to fill in their own answers. This was the worse product I have ever bought off of Amazon.
1,Want to be a BURGLAR?,"I cannot believe all the positive feedback that this book has gotten. Yes, some of it is cute but has anyone noticed that on the page ""what I want to be when I grow up"" the author includes BURGLAR. Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't want my grandson aspiring to be a burglar, nor do I consider that a profession. I do not think it is cute or funny. I'd bet that Dr. Seuss is turning over in his grave! I would never buy it for my children and if they got it as a gift, I'd send it to the publisher and demand a refund! As it is, my grandson's parents were not aware of this page."
5,AWESOME BAND!,"THIS IS SIMPLY ONE OF THE BEST CD'S EVER! WAY AHEAD OF ITS TIME!GREAT SONGS ABOUT LIVING IN THE LATE 90""s NICK LAMAGNA IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SONG WRITERS OF MODERN TIME.EVERY SONG ON THIS IS GREAT AND ART WORK IS STUNNING,SHOWING SAN FRANCISCO IN IT'S NEW GREEDY FUTURE 5 YEARS AHEAD OF TIME! A MUST BUY! BK"
5,You betcha,I couldnt get something like this anywhere else for this price.Best deal big spoon. Nylon great price. What more could anyone want.Its a great spoon. Would have liked one with a different end opposite ofspoon but for that price who cares. Got 4 of them and love them and loveusing them.
4,Nice concert,"This CD/DVD combo is great. The reason I did not give 5 stars is because I thought the sound quality of the DVD is not as good as it should have been. In this concert, seems that Keiko tried to balance between the old and new songs. New songs are mostly come from 'The Ring' and 'Deep Blue'. I like Keiko's piano myself but having Alberto Del Almar as the guitar player is most welcome. His presence gives keiko's song an extra dimension. As far as concert performance, I thought 'The White Gate' and 'Mystic River' really cool to watch. Overall, this CD/DVD combo really a good buy."
4,Very good,"This is the first CD I have bought by this artist and I really enjoyed it. I am quite sure I will be buying more of her music. I first watched and listened to the concert on DVD then I listened to the CD the next day. I tried to find something wrong, something I would not likeabout this CD but was unable to so. I thought that every song on the CD/DVD was very good. Some are just nice to listen to while you think, others make you happy to be alive to enjoy it. Keep up the good music Keiko...."
5,great,"If you like piano, and electeric piano you will love this dvd and cd, I waited to long to get this one."
3,Repeating Material On Other Releases/DVD is Crap!,"This is effectively another ""best-of"" live release, so be careful that you're not buying songs you already have!! The Bonus DVD is Crap! The picture is unwatchable and the audio is mediocre at best!"
5,Mata Leao is Biohazard's best album yet!!!,"I have been following Biohazard since 1989 before they were signed, and they have only gotten better each album. Just when you think that they can't get any heavier or better, they take the rug out from under you. Mata Leao is their best album yet!!! I'm looking forward to New World Disorder, as Billy tells me it's their heaviest yet."
5,!,"this album was one of the reasons that made ''me get into a hardcore band. heavy, fast ... makes the audience head banging."
5,Track Info on This Item,Tracklisting:A A Moment (Remix)Vocals - Staci SmithB1 A Moment (Original)Vocals - Staci SmithB2 July
1,About as bad as bad can get.,"This is truly a masterpiece in demonstrating how not to write music. Hmmm...to even suggest that it was written is too much of a compliment. Let's say it was sort of mashed together; everyone playing their own thing while G.G. screamed whatever came to mind. And given how little of his mind was even functioning, the fact that he could talk was a miracle. This is not punk rock. Do your self a favor and pass on the entire G.G. collection."
5,GG'S LAST WISH,"This is the perfect epitaph for GG career. A must for everyone who loves punk, hardcore, underground or simply sincere music."
2,Too quiet!,"We purchased this and found the volume to be limited. We couldhear people singing, but not through the speakers. The video was only fair. We are replacing it with a CRAIG (available at TRU) that has 30 watts, and has more the volume and sound quality that we were expecting in the 100 dollar price range."
5,Lot's of FUN!!!,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she just loves it. She loves to have friends over and make videos. And they also pretend to interview each other. Too much Fun!!!!
4,MTV's Mini Karaoke Machine,"Bought this item for Christmas. We had lots of fun until the camera burned out. I like the fact that this little machine comes in a complete package--you get a camera to see yourself act like a fool on tv, music to sing with, and lyrics to read from the screen. I also saw it as an educational tool for my daughter because certain tracks required she speed read while singing. Overall I enjoyed this machine, but I was very disappointed when the camera burned out the very first day we opened the package. I would like the same machine as a replacement, but I am skeptical since when I returned this item to the store, I found out someone else had the same problem."
5,BUMMER BURN OUT !,"Bought this item for my kids last Christmas. Was great while it lasted. Used it for about 4 months, weekends only. One day while using (it was only on for 30 minutes) something smelled like it was burning! The machine was HOT! Unplugged it & left it alone for about 2 weeks. Plugged it in again, didnt even turn it on, the smell came back & machine began to heat up! Can't use it any more..... ... I give it 2 thumbs DOWN!"
2,not good enough,"In the search for a great gift for our kids we have brought home and tried out several machines with video camera. It is very cool to have the video. While this machine has some advantages, like the relatively small size and fairly good video, the sound problem outweighs them. The microphone volume is not good at all. No matter how high we turned the microphone in relation to the music we could not hear the singer without putting our ear right up to the speaker. This was true even after hooking to TV and stereo. What fun is karaoke if you can't hear yourself sing??????? We ended up with the larger, but better quality Memorex."
4,Pretty Good Little Machine!,"We received this as a wedding present and at first I was disappointed because it is pretty small - the size of a boombox, really, so I was worried that we wouldn't be able to see the screen and words.However, after about 5 minutes of hookup, we had the words on our TV screen, and we were singing away! My fiancee can even hook his professional microphone (he's in a band) into it for a better quality sound.you have to fiddle with the camera and the sound controls, but you can even hook it into your stereo and run it completely through your stereo and TV, OR my husband even tried hooking it up to one of his big amps and it worked fine too, so theoretically we can have a big backyard karaoke party and have professional sound with this little machine. Highly recommended, a lot of fun!"
2,I Guess I Don't See It Like Everyone Else,"This was the first book I read when faced with the possibility that my son might have autism. Unlike other reviewers I cried all through the reading of it. Granted, that would be a normal reaction to facing my child's diagnosis at the time, but frankly this book made it worse. I felt the book highlighted all the devastating things about the disorder and accented the ""weirdness"" of it.Particularly hurtful to me was how each form of therapy or treatment was profiled. The last paragraph of the section always told why that treatment could never work for long if at all. I remember the question ""Is there hope?"" being asked with the answer ""Absolutely."" However,this book did not make me feel hopeful and in fact compounded my grief. I have since come to learn that there is indeed great hope and documented scientific proof of some therapy's efficacy. I believe the author's intentions were to be helpful and informative, but I could never recommend this book."
2,Corrupted on Very First Use,Took this to Europe and after taking more than 200 pictures I got an error and could no longer access the pictures. Luckily I was able to recover the pics with some recovery software. Never had this issue with any other card I've used so I'm guessing it was a problem with the card. Beware.
1,Avoid this item-even if you get it for free!,"With every roll I shoot there are several photos that are missing or labeled (UNABLE TO READ) also known as corrupted files. I paid $200 for this card in August of 2006, when 4GB cards were more expensive. I used it with my Canon EOS 5D and EOS 20D, and card reader, there is always some data missing. If you travel and you need to be able to download ALL the photos you shot, as precious moments come only once!! -then DO NOT USE this card, even if it was given to you for free--Try Sandisk Flash cards instead or Sandisk ultra II-they never failed me."
1,Avoid even if free,"Took photos on trip to Iceland, after return could not download more than half. Formatted the card, but on the next trip to Guatemala, same thing, more than half photos are ""unable to read"". If you value your memories, or need the shoots for work, get any other card than this. I have 5 cards total, different brands, and none of the others ever had problem."
1,"can not be read, which makes it about useless","brand new media card - camera doesn't recognize it, computer doesn't recognize it, CF media player doesn't recognize it... never had a problem with any other brand but Dane-Elec. their customer support was non-existent, despite e-mails and phone calls (forever on hold). am planning on returning this to amazon, maybe they'll decide not to carry this product anymore."
4,Amazing but pricy!,"This book is a terrific resource for those wishing to study Josquin in depth. It is especially insightful in light of recent scholarship that shows that Josquin was not at Milan. I used it for research into the Missa Pange Lingua. I believe in the value of solid musical scholarship, but this book is extraordinarily cost prohibitive. Unfortunately, it is priced only for library consumption. (The one star deduction is for cost only)"
2,they just won't stop pimping 2pac's legacy won't they?,"deathrow remixed some of pac's tracks from his makaveli stage and a few cuts from all eyez on me i prefer the originals better and it's a shame they are doing the man's music like this and to make matters worse eminem's producing a track with him and biggie called runnin another bootleg track and em once disdsed folks for making money off pac, and big l;ooks like he's taking notes from 50 cent, and arch nemesis ja rule."
4,Old fashioned fantasy horror at its best,Merrit wrote spooky fantasy for Argosy Magazine in the 1920-1930s. Fans argue endlessly about which is his best. These stories are pretty good. (Shadow is a sort of sequel to Burn Witch Burn.) The evil old witch makes lifelike dolls that come to life and kill people. She is brought down by a rational doctor and a superstitious Mafia boss. Made into a movie with Lionel Barrymore as the witch (really!). Strong stuff for the time it was written.
4,Not Bad,"This soup is really pretty good--but a little bland for my taste. I like the fact that it's got lots of fiber and is low fat. And all natural. It's very quick to fix--just add hot water. I have to punch it up a little with hot sauce or diced fresh tomato or add a little chopped up spinach. So, if you want a quick, healthy, comforting snack, I would recommend it. If you want a boat load of flavor, you'll have to ""kick it up a notch."""
1,Horrible,"I've tried several of these soups, but this one is awful. Tastes watery and gross. I can't think of anything good to say about it. The one I really enjoy is the couscous lentil curry one. So much better than this. I would not recommend this soup."
1,TASTE IS NOT GOOD,I BOUGHT THE MINESTRONE AND RED BEAN AND RICE BOTH ARE LACKING A GOOD TASTE .I ALSO BOUGHT LIPTON AND IT IS GOOD !
4,These are healthy and convenient,"These are healthy and convenient soup-in-a-cups. Add hot water, stir, and wait five minutes. You get a tasty cup of soup for a good price. You get a good variety of spices, compared to other ""soup-in-a-cup"" products."
3,fiskar garden rake #9662,"Purchased fiskar garden rake #9662 love the off set tines and the handle making it light weight,but were the rake and the handle meet is wimpy.I have already broke the joint at that connection. Fiskars needs to reinforce that area of the rake and it will be perfect. I have already done it to my broken rake. They need to build it like their longhandled shovel, heavey duty!"
2,Designed by someone who has never actually touched a garden tool before...,"I'm always excited when I find a ""new and improved"" garden tool that looks promising and this one did... I was wrong.It's ""grabby"" and clogs easily. Also leaves a very coarse grade. If I could send it back, I would, but I can't.So I did the next-best thing... I ""loaned"" it to a next-door neighbor who never, ever returns what he borrowed. And this time? I don't CARE!"
1,One of the worst I've seen,"This photo is washed out because of the flash, it shows a thumb, a part of a motorcycle, and is foreshortened beyond any hope of recognition. The only useful aspect is that the title can be read which relates it tenuously to the actual video sleeve. It does not actually represent the sleeve's fine artwork, art which makes the item a very attractive buy."
3,Epson PictureMate Deluxe Viewer Edition,"We love the printer and it produces great photos, but it will not recognize SDHC memory cards. I emailed Epson and they never did answer back. I still would like to know why it will not recognize these cards."
1,bad product,"Epson Picture Mate Deluxe Viewer Edition Photo Printer Item shipped incorrectly and because of that the item was scratched up quite badly. It also did not come with the right cords in order to see if the product even works. I am unable to test this product and am disappointed in the sellers attempt to prevent me from operating this machine. She attempted to send another cord, it does not fit this machine. I cannot believe someone who owned this machine would not know what is needed to operate this machine. Disgusted at this point that I have ink and paper I purchased at the time as this machine and yet now need to look for the appropriate cords and USB equipment to even test this equipment. No battery with item"
5,Great Printer!,"This is a great printer! I didn't buy it here, in fact I saw it in a store that I guess was no longer going to carry it and nabbed the last one for $18!!! I think it's the best buy I have ever made!!! It's easy to use, has some neat frames that are fun for kids pics and makes spectacular photos. I used up the 20 pages of Epson photopaper that came with it and tried some glossy Kodak that I had on hand. It prints just as great on it too! The initial tonor cartridge is said to only print about 20 photos, but I've printed 30 so far and the quality is a good as the first one. Don't just replace the cartridge just because it says it will only print x number of photos...I would (and have) recommend this printer to anyone. I have only used it by putting in my SD card from my camera so far. I would love to purchase a battery for it, too, but haven't yet.Great printer at any price!!"
3,Broke after using once.,The PictureMate stopped working after using once. We called the manufacturer and was told it was out of warranty even though it was purchased just 2 months ago. After much discussion they decided to send us a new one. In the future I will probably buy this type of item from a camera shop to be sure there are no problems with the warranty.
2,Great Pictures - Poor Hardware Quality,"I purchased this printer 10 months ago after reading the reviews which all seemed great. I've always been an HP fan.Great product?....Give it some time. My printer has never been moved from its original location. It has developed blue blocks of color on everything despite numerous attempts at cleaning, aligning, cartridge changes, etc. When I contacted Epson tech support they sent a document on how to clean, align, and change the cartridges. It's not worth the hassle of sending it 40 miles to a service center. HP is looking better all the time."
2,Not so great,"I have had a Picture Mate printer for a few years now. I'm thinking of finally getting rid of it and buying something else. The set-up is a hassle. It's slow to respond to commands, doesn't' recognize some devices and is just not user friendly. Every time I use it, I have to do a nozzle clean, which is inconvenient and uses up ink and paper. The menu is quite laborious and slow. Maybe it's just too old, but I remember shelling out quite a bit of money for it a few years ago. Because of this, I would buy another brand."
4,Works Well But Know This . . .,"I am very excited about using this printer. It just arrived today and I printed one picture. The picture appears just as it should - bright, colorful, and looks like a quality print. This is much better than going to a store to have it printed.NOTE: I used two SanDisk SD memory cards and only one of them worked. After calling Epson technical support for this printer, I was informed by a helpful, knowledgeable representative that this printer cannot recognize SD cards over the capacity of 2.4 GB. So this card:SanDisk SDSDPH-008G-A11 8GB/15MB Ultra II SD Plus Carddidn't work in this machine. The other card I used was 2.0 GB.Other than that, this machine works quite well, and I highly recommend it."
4,Epson Does It Again,"Once again, Epson has developed a fine product. This very User-friendly photo printer has a plethora of capabilities to ensure the print meets the expectations of the User. It is compact, of course, and its excellent portability makes it a ""Must-Have"" for the enthusiast who wants to produce prints for friends within minutes of the takes at any venue. Super item at a reasonable price."
5,Great little printer!,"I totally agree with all the other glowing reviews... great photo quality, even better than that of the website I used to upload to and get pictures by mail. Colors are truer and whites are whiter. Probably cheaper in the long run to print at home using this great little machine, when you take into account shipping or driving to a store to pickup. Oh, and it was super-easy to set up... took less than 15 minutes to unpack it and get it printing from Adobe Photoshop, and it interfaces perfectly!"
4,"Great Printer, Fuzzy LCD Screen","I just received this printer but my first impressions are very positive. The prints I've made so far have been great. My only complaint so far is the LCD screen. The picture display on the screen is on the fuzzy side which makes it difficult to determine what editing the photo may need. That means I usually have to preview and edit it on my computer first, which is inconvenient at times."
5,Espon PictureMate Deluxe Printer,"This a great machine that is versatile, highly portable, prints high quality photos and all for a great price. It's so easy to share photos and make memories come alive with instant printing. This is a great piece for parties--simply sling the carrying case over your shoulder, snap some photos and print out momentos of the occasion while everyone's eating refreshments. I've used it for several such occasions and everyone is so appreciative and excited to take home a photo as a remembrance of the event. It's been an awesome piece of equipment to have. I highly recommend it!"
4,Great little Printer!,"Great Quality. 4.50 stars. The only thing I wish the printer had (unless I have not found it yet) is a function to ""Select certain"" pictures off of a memory card and them print them (to basically tell the Epson exactly which pitures I want (program the printer) before I print them out so I dont have to keep coming back to the printer..... All I have found is ""Print a selectable range"" of pictures like from 5-15 or print certain photos ""one at a time"". I am not using a computer with this printer. I am taking pics on my camera and then use the card directly in the printer. very simple.Great little printer other than this. Mabye I have not found this feature yet? It would be great to pop in a card of say 200 pictures and then select 10 of them (before pressing the print button) and have those 10 print out instead of printing one by one and having to keep coming back to the printer!"
3,Easy,"Easy enough for my parents to use. Without help. They don't even have to hook it up to the computer. I got it for $80 at Amazon, but it was refurbished (which was a surprise). It doesn't matter, the price you pay for the supplies will far far exceed what you pay for the printer."
2,Not nearly what I thought it would be!,"Based on all the hype and even reading the reviews I thought this would be a really good, easy to use photo printer. Instead I find that it does not seamlessly interface with a MAC: it will print after you have to switch printers in several places to the Picture Mate, but sometimes it put white bars, like a border on the bottom and top of the picture, and out of Mac's 'Preview' it will only print a small piece of the total image. I have called both Mac and Epson and they refer me back to each other, neither helping me resolve the issue I have. Oh, and while picture quality overall is good, it is not great. I was really looking forward to using this printer, but am quite disappointed in the end."
2,Prints Beautifly But Still Not Worth It,"I recieved this as a this for a gift in 05 and completely stopped using it by mid 2006. While the prints were perfect, and it was nice to be able to jazz people by the ability to print pics from their visit--same day, there were just too many cons. I HATE that I am forced to buy the ink in an expensive package, combined with 100 sheets of Epson picture paper. The print pack ink is guaranteed to last for ALL of the 100 paper's but it never lasted beyond 30 prints for me! I have built up quite the stockpile of left over printer photo paper now, so much for ""guaranteed to last"". I thought Epson would be the answer to my printer nightmares (I'm a former HP printer user), but they have proven to be the worst of all with their strictly proprietary products."
5,Super Easy,This photo printer is so easy to use and the pictures are very clear. Had mine up and running in about ten minutes. Sure beats my old photo printer hands down.
3,not very impressed,I bought this printer two months ago and have been pretty disappointed. Some pictures print really well but I can't seem to get a narrow blue band to go away at the top of photos now no matter how many times I clean the nozzle. I would not recommend this printer.
4,Epson Deluxe Picturemate,"This prints out great quality pictures. I was not disappointed. The ability to see and fix pictures directly on this is great. However, don't try using anything but epson paper - the quality is severly compromised."
4,Excellent,"I load my memory card, start scrolling and find a picture I want to print, I print it, and then when I want to go back to the pictures, I lands be back to picture 1 in the list not where I last was. Now I have over 300 pictures in my card, so this is a real problem having to scroll from the beginning for each selection. Am I doing something wrong? Seems there must be a way to select a picture and then go back to the list where you last were. Otherwise the machine is wonderful."
1,Can NOT read 2GB SD cards,"I don't know how the printer works because I could never print a picture. It wouldn't read my card, and when I called Epson (on my own dime as the number they give for tech support is not toll free) I was first told the printer was out of warranty (after having it in my possession for about 15 minutes) was then put on hold and was finally told it couldn't read 2 GB cards. This while I am looking at a sticker on the printer that says, ""Any camera, any card."" When I asked about this the tech guy could only repeat that it couldn't read my card. I am sending it back. Hopefully Amazon will make this a smooth transaction.Hey, this printer may be great. It sounds great based on the other reviews, but if you have or plan to get a 2 GB card stay away."
3,Great pictures but wasted ink,"The quality of pictures are terrific. The entire printing process is easy. However, compared to newer products, it is awfully slow. If you will not use this product on a regular basis (monthly), don't buy it. The printhead will clog and you will waste most of the ink in the cartridge cleaning it. I have lots of great 4x6 print paper left with no ink to print. I am sure there are better products on the market at a lower cost."
5,None other like it,"The tactical folding knife is one of today's most popular yet least understood defensive weapons. In this first-of-its-kind video, veteran knife instructor Michael Janich teaches the skills needed to use the folding knife as a defensive weapon. Janich reveals little-known secrets of knife selection, carry methods, proper grip and split-second one-handed openings. He then presents a comprehensive hands-on course in folding knife tactics, such as defensive responses, reflex training drills, high-speed combinations and the realities of knife stopping power. Janich also shows how to combine empty-hand skills, rapid deployment techniques and knife tactics to make the folder an invaluable ally in close-quarter combat. If you are going to carry a folding knife for self-defense, you need to do two thingss: Check the city and state laws where you live, and get this excellent video.Loren W. Christensen, author of FIGHTER'S FACT BOOK"
3,Decent,This is a super poor production but Mr. Janich clearly knows his stuff. I did learn several new opening techniques so I'd say it was worth it.
4,"A little quirky, but good overall..","I am more of a fan of the outlaw country REK rather than the aging hippie REK, so this was not one of my favorite REK albums. However, there are some jewels to be picked out of this LP. I found that the album started off strong, had a lull in the middle, and then picked up again towards the end. The first 4 tracks are good, including ""Out Here in the Middle"", which I think is the best song on the album (this song gets a lot of play on KPIG down in Cali). The next 4 songs are not very good, the music and songwritting seems to be scatter brained. Both elements pick up on the last 4 songs of the CD. Other standouts on this CD include: ""Furnace Fan"", ""Beats the Devil"", and ""Let the Music Play"". I would recommend this CD to anyone who is starving to listen to some new music...and go to one of REK's shows!!! He is unbelievable live!!!"
2,This is not a good album,"REK hit bottom on this album. It is nowhere near the quality of his previous efforts. I can barely make myself listen through it, and I have been a Robert Earl Keen fan for sometime. There are a few good songs on it, but it is just a mish-mash of styles with weak vocals throughout. This is one is going to get very little play in my house. Save your money."
3,Train Trek Worth It,Not one of my favorite REK's but the first 4 songs on the album make it worth the cost of owning. His lyrics are outtanding. 'Out in the Middle' should ring a bell with anyone that lives in or grew up in an area where you don't have to wait 45 minutes for a seat at a good restaurant.
4,+++++++,"Rollicking, fun album. Pleasantly surprising after last album's shalac-heavy production and calculated variety. This new album has several songs I can't wait to hear in concert, worthy of joining his live cannon. Longtime REK guitarist-virtuoso Rich Brotherton provides the clear and snappy production."
2,WHERE DA FIDDLE ROBERT?,"I had to have this CD simply because I own every other REK CD and wanted my collection to be complete. I was pretty disappointed after listening to it though. I guess I'm more a fan of ""Bigger Piece of Sky,"" or other earlier stuff. This just sounds so bland. There isn't any fiddle, harmonica, mandolin, or even much accoustic guitar. (All of the stuff that made me love REK in the first place). Instead, every song sounds like the same mixture of bass, electric guitar, and drums. This doesn't sound like country music (Texas or otherwise) in the least. It's just kinda weird. I still love the older music, but after anticipating this release for quite a while, it turned out to be quite a let down."
2,My Vote for Last Place in REK CD Race,"This CD is even behind his 1984 debut ""No Kinda Dancer"". As someone who owns all of his CDs, I would buy many others before this one. Begin with ""West Textures"" and ""Gringo Honeymoon"" and maybe work from there. For me the first three selections are pretty good, but as for the rest...I still love REK but not those songs."
2,You get what you pay for,"This cable is low quality, but you can't really expect more for something you paid $1.99.The cable works, but vertical lines appear on the screen which is quite annoying. The image is not dramatically distorted, so the cable can be used for low-quality videos (e.g. youtube) but if you want to enjoy a good movie then I suggest you get a higher quality cable"
3,Looks fine.,"Bought it to replace a cable damaged in a burglary. In the end, the new set-up didn't require it. It appears to be very well made, high quality cable. [Sony seems to have abandoned S-Cable inputs on their TVs in favor of lower quality component connections - a low reqard for legecy equipment sources.]"
3,OK for the price,"I replaced a 10-year old Monster cable (that had a bent pin) with this generic cable for playing DVDs over our large plasma and the quality wasn't as good. I noticed subtle but distracting ""motion"" and ""patterns"" within the image on screen. A techie friend called this ""signal loss."" The cable certainly functions better than the broken one it replaced and is a good buy at the price, but I will upgrade shortly. I can't negatively review a new electronic item that sells for $0.01 plus shipping. This inexpensive cable is fine for use with a small screen."
5,Great Deal,I got this for a fraction of the price I would have paid at a local store. Does the job equally well and without any problems (that I can tell). Good product and great deal!
1,SNAPPED IN TWO,My disappointment in not being able to watch my wrasslin' video's on my DVR with this S cable was so powerful that I was gonna hang myself with this strong appearing cord....Strung it over a beam in the barn....climbed up on a milk stool..and snap!!! So now I'ma gonna send it back..
3,OK,I wish I would have bought a different cable. It is ok but no better than a standard cheaper svideo cable
5,Nice!,"Great! Came quickly in the mail, (much faster than expected). Works great. It's just what we expected for an s-video cable."
2,ughhhhh,maybe im not using it right or something is wrong with my laptop cause when I hooked this up to my tv from my inspiron 6000 I had no picture...I think I'm gonna try again with another TV but I was very dissapointed
5,Great price for this cable!,I have several S-video cables around the house and this one works just as well as my expensive S-video cables that I got from Best Buy.I use this cable to connect my laptop to the television. Works great! I would recommend this cable and the seller to anyone!
3,Works Great! Terrible Shipping Time,"This is a 4-prong 12 footed S-video cord that works great and is incredibly inexpensive (not including the shipping which was $5.00). The company, however, did a terrible job shipping it and I had to wait about a month to get it in my mailbox."
1,Lousy S-Video cable. Worthless !!!,"I would have given it ""0"" stars if possible.Construction ""looks"" good, but obviously is not. Cable would NOT connect properly and NOTHING could come through. No video. No nothing.This S-Video cable would not seat well into the sockets because the rubber was too close to the metal ends which prevented them from going in far enough. Even after I trimmed off the rubber, it still would not work.Was not worth the money to ship back.Waste of time. Waste of money. Just a WASTE, period !!"
3,It's a cable,"The cable was shipped promptly and arrived in good condition. It's the promised 12 feet long, and its construction looks fine. I use this cable to connect a laptop to an LCD television. The connection works, though I'm a little disappointed with the picture on the television. It lacks the clarity and sharpness I had hoped for.I tweaked the settings on the laptop, but there was no improvement.I can't say anything is wrong with the cable itself. Maybe using a different method of connnection would work better.If there's a change in the picture quality, I'll update this review."
5,Nice buy,This was inexpensive and I was initially worried about the quality. But the it works as expected. I am now able to stream You tube from my old laptop.Shipping was on time as well.
5,High Quality Product,"Very high quality cable, flawless transmission from PC to CRT TV.I would definitely recommend this item to suit any s-video need."
1,Not good,This cable is not very good. Horrible interference. Get what you pay for. Avoid this cable if possible. Buy something better.
4,cable wires,I needed a cable for the tv and buying it through Amazon saves me a trip to the store. Reasonably priced
3,Get These Elsewhere!,"These are the typical fuses found in C7 or C9 size Christmas string lights, but are used for other things. Instead of buying them here and spending MORE for shipping than for the fuses, just head to any hardware or home improvement store. You can find these in the electrical section for the same price as here."
3,What's with the format of this book?,"I ordered this book as a Valentines present for myself, also to get in touch with my Korean side. (I'm half Korean) None of the recipes seemed at all familiar to the ones my mother made except the Barley tea. The format is confusing to me also. Everything is done per celebration versus chapters of entrees. I do appreciate some of the history and explanation of customs, but not enough to recommend this book to anyone."
1,terrible...and I know Korean Food,"I know my Korean food and I cook it at home as well. The ingredients might be correct, but there is no way anyone would make 2 pounds of kimchi with 1 tablespoon of chili powder. That is not enough to season the kimchi! If you're going to try any of these recipes, I would look for them online elsewhere and hope that the recipes you find have enough seasoning to make your food taste good. The bulgogi recipes (bbq beef) don't even have enough ingredients for the marinade to cover the meat!I wish I could delete this from my kindle forever. As is, it's stuck in the archive now. Save your time and don't bother even though it's free."
3,Korean Cuisine Cookbook,The book wasnt exactly what i expected.Its hard to find recipes by the Korean name. There under there english translation.
2,Curve For Men Gift Set,"The product I received was not what I ordered. The item being reviewed clearly has a 3.4 ounce body moisturizer, which is what I expected to get. However, instead of the moisturizer that was shown with the set I ordered I got aftershave. If I wanted aftershave instead of moisturizer I would have ordered one of the many gift sets that included it. I would have returned the order, but I did not have time to exchange it as it was a gift to be given a few days after receipt."
4,It's a good introduction to internet privacy,"If your like a lot of people I know you have heard a lot about internet privacy, the risks and so on. You have ""heard"" of cookies, logging, stalkers and information gathering but it all sounded to far away or just not relevant. The book tells it how it is in plain english what the risks are how it works and what can be done or in some cases what can't be done about it. I bought this book for my parents and read it before giving it to them. I am a programmer so I know a lot of this stuff already and though the book was a little light for me I found that even I felt more comfortable after reading it. I would recommend this book to anyone who uses the internet."
3,Metolius Bouldering Bag,"I am almost absolutely content with this bag. It has 3 compartments. two big ones for climbing shoes and a smaller one for essentials (wallet, phone, keys & etc.). The problem i have with the bag is that on the smaller pocket it doesn't have anything in it. I mean, there are no small pockets or a ring for the keys anything. It would be nice if they have small pockets for pens, paper and whatever just so you can organize your stuff in the compartment. But other than that the bag is awesome!"
4,The 2nd Star Trek book I ever read,"This book is the one that got me started reading books in English. Only ""Star Trek-The Motion Picture"" was published in Norwegian, so when I came across ""Corona"", a whole new world of Star Trek books opened up to me. After that I've read all kinds of books in English, but this beeing kind of special to me. It's not the best ST book I've ever read, but I collect them all."
3,An enjoyable quick read.,"Bear does a reasonably good job of portraying the known characters, and develops a few new ones that are also interesting. His plot has some similarities to the episode ""The Ultimate Computer"", and also some similarities to various books and episodes, notably ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"", that involve the Enterprise saving the universe (or at least all life as we know it therein) from an almost-all-powerful energy creature. But for all of that, the plot is handled well enough that it was only occasionally noticable that the basic plot was somewhat hackneyed. Also, interestingly, it was not actually a member of the Enterprise crew who really saves the day.This book does not, really, break any new ground, but the plot moves well and the writing is competent."
3,"Out of the ST universe, but still an average read...","While this story doesn't really follow ST canon, it still an average story on its own. Like a computer that can overide the captain's orders, or the ship exceeding Warp 9. Hhhmmm! I didn't like some of the new characters. I didn't think they fitted into the story. But, after saying all that I liked the moving of the story from beginning to end.Average read!Russ"
3,"One of the early, and almost forgettable Star Trek novels.","When Corona was first published in 1984, it was one of the first 20 Star Trek novels to be published by Pocket Books. As number 15, Corona was on the edge between those initial novels that had been polished for years before publication, and the second wave of novels purposely written for this series of novels. Corona is a bit of a rehash of the old ""Supercomputer"" runs the ship and ""Energy Beings are going to destroy the universe"" scenarios. Put Corona on your list after you have exhausted your suuply of all the other Star Trek books"
4,16 year old collector,"This toy is very cool. He comes with a number of accessories, including an authentic samarai sword, pistol, military cap, and more! The sword comes with a sheath, and the pistol has a holster. There is even a bullet clip that slides into the pistol. The uniform itself is impressive, it has all the insignias, topped off by a Rising Sun arm band. Another thing I like is that he comes with a mini Japanese flag. It really enhances the display when you stand him at attention. This toy is great for starting collectors, as it is low in price but high in quality. Recommended for any WWII buff or G.I. Joe collector in general."
5,Forces of Nature Jock Itch No More (11 ml),"I think that this is a very good product. After trying several different creams and a pill, that didn't work, I tried ""Jock Itch No More"". The itching stopped on the first application with total control in two weeks.I would highly recommend this product."
2,Jock-Itch Some More!!!!!!,"""Jock-Itch No More"", more like Jock-Itch SOME More!!!! I was very disappointed when used this product.. I had all my hopes of relieving my problems for about a year now... The product seem to be legit with the natural ingredients and 2 superb feedback, but as soon as I put the liquid on, I didn't feel a single different.. I mean it felt like putting oil on your jock and smell like mineral spirits(turpenoid natural-paint thinner).. The itch is still there while the oil is there.. I didn't see a change in skin color or any relieve... I apply it twice a day while wearing loose pants... I been using it for a months now.. Why isn't this working... I give this a two instead of a one because maybe it will work if I give it more time..."
3,Good story but not a real mystery,"I enjoyed the story and a lot of the characters but found the mystery a little lacking. The main character really did no sleuthing and the main and sub-mysteries were resolved by chance and confession. I thought the ending sort of came out of left field and had no real clues leading up to it.This was my first book from this author and I'm not sure I would read another one. I don't feel like my time was wasted as it was an enjoyable book, I just prefer mysteries with a bit more detecting."
3,not really a mystery,"yes, there's a murder. yes, there are police detectives. yes, there is a confession, which in many ways comes out of left field.but, it's not a police procedural. and the main character does absolutely no detecting on her own--she barely asks questions. the mystery is solved, as mentioned, by a confession, which ties up most loose ends.it's not a bad read--i enjoyed much of it. the editing could have been a lot better--many pieces of information were repeated, sometimes within a few pages; the same adjective was used for the same character more than once in the same situation; the same phrase was used in two connected paragraphs. still, i did read it until the end.i don't know that i will read any of the author's other books, though. i prefer mysteries where the mystery is the focus, either of police efforts or amateur detectives' efforts. in this, the murder was almost uninportant."
1,The Millenium Criminals Strike Again!,"It seems like the Millenium brand exists to rip off consumers and trivialize the legacy of major recording artists. First of all, how can you justify putting out an 11-track cd of songs which are usually 3 minutes long or less? Even more so when the artist in question was a legend even BEFORE he went solo? Surely Michael Jackson deserves at least 24 tracks. Millenium has done similar hatchet jobs on the Spinners, the Four Tops and Sublime. If ever a company's product was ALL about the money, this is it! Put these turkeys out of business--don't buy this compilation!"
4,It is Good,You need to be sort of sappy to like this CD. I had the LP years ago (One Day in Your Life) & enjoy the music a great deal. You hear so much crap out there these days- what is wrong with some songs about feelings. One Day in Your Life is the kind of song that everybody feels sometime.
4,Great Memoir,"I love memoirs and this nostalgic read made me think of my younger days. Though I lived my life much further west than the author, I can relate to so many of the experiences that she and her famiy lived through. The author's father always called her princess even though they lived in a 3 room apartment and she had to sleep wit her brother. Her father always made her feel like a princess. The little family owned a little corner grocery store that let people buy on credit. There is a closness of the neighbors and their kids playing in the streets while the parents visited on the porches during the summer in the heat of the evening. They were poor people struggling day to day to get by much as our family did. There were some really dark times as well as there are in most peoples lives. But it was a very special time. That era is long past and this book brought back some wonderful memories; The good and bad times of years past."
5,This book would make a great movie!,"I read Divison Street Princess and loved every page. SOloway writes wonderfully, and evokes a certain America magically, she has created a very important memoir.I feel the book is so important in Americana culture and Jewish-Americana cultural archives, that the book should eventually be entered onto an online Internet site, free of charge, so that readers in the future, and I mean the FUTURE, like 500 years from now, can also read this moving memoir! Also, this would make a great movie in the Barry Levinson vein of Hollywoodiana. The murder of the little girl and the arrest of the murderer would make a fantastic 1950s Chicago movie story, with Soloway's memoir bookending the movie on both sides."
5,Purest of Pain is purely sensational,"This rich mix of saucy latin salsa and the contemporary fine tuned voices of the Son By Four is the hottest thing in the market and it will propel your hips to swivel like nothing has in quite a while! The sensual lyrics in this music are deep and well sung by this quartet of sexy salsa music. Regardless of your background, you'll appreciate the latino-carribean beats which bring out the heat in anyone..."
4,Great to listen to anytime!,Here's a CD that I never tire of listening to. Their style is great and they have harmony down pat. This is a CD that you can put on at a party and everyone will enjoy it. They deserve more recognition that what they get (not everyone loves N'Sync and Backstreet Boys). It's a keeper!
5,Comprenlo!,"¡Si te gusta la salsa, compre este disco compacto! ¡Es lo mejor, el grupo Son by Four es de puta madre!"
2,can see outline,I tried these and you can see the outline of the petals thru my shirt. Would not buy again:( I am still searching for the perfect pair. I guess I need to go to Nordstrom.
4,Works well,"This did exactly what I needed it to and it works well. I wish it was just a little stickier. I just have to make sure that area is very dry when applying this. But, it's never come off when I've wore it and it held up even in hot sweaty weather."
5,A truely memoroable book for any mother & child,"This is such a great book. The story is simple. And is an excellent bed time story. Every time I read it to my 5 year old son, he loves it as much as I do. Readers can see things through a mothers perspective and at the very end you get a wonderful ending that'll make you look forward to the next reading."
3,Same as every other anime,"Stereotypical anime where a loner guy is surrounded with hot girls. Story falls into the classic anime stereo type, ie first few episodes advance the story, then a group of episodes that dont have anything to do with the story it just shows you what it is like when the characters go to the beach or something and then at the end they rush to complete the story only to make a pointless ova after that to leech more money from the fans."
1,What a pain!,"Absolutely terrible. I can understand that the game doesn't know where the ships got put automatically - that takes some additional electronics to achieve. But would it have killed them to put in a bunch of cheap 2-color LEDs, to keep track of when you hit and when you missed? Would it have been so hard to make the voice clear and understandable? Why can't you press any buttons until the voice stops speaking each prompt - which slows the game to a crawl as you sit there, waiting for it to finish saying the same stock phrases, over and over? Who playtested this thing, anyway?Also, ships are poorly constructed - they sit on little stands and they fall off the stands easily - and you have to take them off the stands to pack the game up, so glue isn't an option.Basically, this is 1.25$ worth of badly engineered electronics in a $49 plastic box, made frustrating to play. NOT a good deal."
2,too much trouble,"This game is really boring. You'd think the game would know where you put you're ships, but it doesn't!! You have to enter in the coordinates of the ships you place. The special weapons are fun, but you could do just as well with a plain old Battleship set, making up the secondary weapons. Inventing them is half the fun! The *only* electronic part is the sound effects, and they're not so great. The voices are painfully cut-and-pase sounding. I'm a big Star Wars fan, so I thought I'd like this game, but NO!! If you like the idea of secondary weapons, invent your own and play with pencil and paper!I don't really know how durable it is; I haven't abused it. The ships do have a tendency to come off the stands, though"
2,I was disappointed,"For the money this game should be more ""electronic"" (as it is advertised), and less dependant on manual entries. It takes an agonizing long time to set up the board since each piece's location must be manually entered by each player. This takes so long that none of us are anxious to start a new game. I thought the game would automatically do this. I would not buy it again."
5,love it!,My kids love this game! Disneyland Park has it for half the price in the Star Wars shop at the end of Star Tours. So don't buy it through Amazon if you are going to be at the park anytime soon!
4,Soup is good!,Recommended on a Dr Oz show to eat before your dinner. This soup takes away those hunger pains so you do not over eat. It is also lower in sodium than most Miso soups. It is vegetarian and tastes good.
1,Go for the Real Thing,"Originally I had bought the ""full-sodium"" Miso-Cup soup packets that contained 690 mg of sodium and it tastes identical to what you would get at a restaurant. When I saw the reduced sodium packets, I was excited because Im always looking for more healthy alternatives. This Miso Cup reduced sodium is disgusting. It not only has no flavor but the bits of soy and whatever else is in there, doesn't get soft and just floats at the top of the soup like rocks. Now, I have a huge box of these soup packets and am not really sure what to do with them. I've tried preparing it different ways, but still haven't been able to finish a single cup of it. My advise? Go for the full-sodium Miso-Cup. Yeah, it has more sodium, but it tastes great and is high in protein, vitamins and minerals."
1,Doesn't even taste like miso soup,"After following the rather simple instructions (add one packet to 8oz of hot water and stir), I was extremely disappointed. The soup produced tastes and looks nothing like miso soup. Now I'm stuck with 47 more packets I have no intention of eating.Trust me, just buy another brand. This one is horrible."
2,It just doesn't taste that good,"It doesn't especially taste like Miso soup. In fact, it doesn't taste like much anything at all. Slightly brown hot water. Miso soup is a wonderful thing, but these packets do not produce anything that I'd call Miso. Sure, opinions vary on taste, but don't get a 48 pack unless you're sure you like this stuff!"
2,"Not horrible soup, but it's not miso","It's almost impossible to make miso soup without using dashi, the Japanese stock made from dried fish flakes. For this reason, miso soup by definition is never vegetarian. Yet ""Miso-Cup"" tries this for the sake of remaining vegetarian.So what you get in these packets is a somewhat bland-flavored veggie-tasting soup. There are other miso packets out there, some even contain dried dashi powder. But, the best miso is still home-made, with real or powdered dashi."
1,No Flavor,Tried my best to doctor up this flavorless soup but was not able to. Don't know what to do with the rest of the boxes. Very disappointed.
2,Don't pay anything over $45 for this item!!!,Beware of overly priced items! You can go to the Kyocera online store (you can get there from kyocera.com) and purchase this item for $45 directly from Kyocera so do not pay more than that!
4,If you love Beres this is a must have.,I really enjoy listening to this album. My husband keeps on CD in the house and the other in the car. This is definitely a winner.
5,Golden Voice Of Jamaica,"Anybody who grew up with old time reggae music like me would appreciate this compilation of Beres Hammond hits. There's no one can compare to his golden voice and music, something you can relax to after a hard day's work, wake up to on the weekend or spending time with that special person. Youths these days should listen to more music like Beres Hammond and other reggae music that promotes love and kindness to one another instead of music that promotes violence and devaluation of one's self!"
4,Best of Beres,"Beres Hammond is known around the world for his smooth reggae vibe. This collection of his best features the hits ""No Disturb Sign"", ""Pull it Up"", ""What one dance can do"", ""They gonna talk"", and many more. The only song missing is ""Reggae Calling"" from the In Control album. That song would have definately made this compilation complete. Even if you are not a reggae fan, check out this album and you will experience the sweet vibes of reggae..."
1,what do you expect for 25.00$,"You don't get much for 25.00$, even if it's made in asia. Shallow pockets w/ no zippers, elastic wrist bands with not much elastic, left handed zipper(on a mens jacket????) Would not recommend!!!!"
4,Anakin FX lightsabre,"I received my lightsabre after a long wait from when I ordered it at Celebration 2, May 2002. It looked great and worked okay the first few times. I had trouble with the threading on the battery housing, it kept misaligning no matter how careful I was, and after I did get it aligned and screwed back in place it stuck and I had to get a real man to loosen it for me. After about the 3rd or 4th time of taking it out of it's box and showing it to fan club members the sound started shorting out and I could not get it to make any sound. I have since contacted Master Replicas 3 times before I got an answer. This customer rep. was very nice and sent me a shipping label so I can return it for a replacement or a repair. I think they need to work on the electronics and the sound quality, otherwise it is a nice collector item to have. Of course; now that I have this, my Star Wars club wants to use it in our fan film as a prop...so we will see how it looks on film."
1,"""What a piece of JUNK!""","I just got my saber today.... This has to be the WORST saber replica I ever saw. I've bought better ones from fan sites. First, its made out of a [inexpensive] plastic, not even metal. Second, the blade has a limited life span,Kinda like a lightbulb. After a certain number of hours ( master replica says up to 1000 hrs, Ya rite!) the blade will no longer light up! I sent mine back..."
5,must have replica prop...,"I was very excited when it finally came. The lightsaber is very secured in the box that it came in. A little difficulty installing the batteries in, but once they were in place, it was all uphill from there. The sound effects and luminescent blade were simultaneously working once turned on. The hilt is nicely chromed and well designed, and the sounds effects are realistic. I would highly recommend swinging this thing around in a very spacious room with high ceilings, because i've hit the ceiling once or twice, and a couple of lamps and picture frames (you know who you are out there). As soon as you activate the on switch, you feel like a jedi in the heat of battle. In conclusion, a must have for any Star Wars collector..."
4,A time machine,"Ever wonder what Paris was like in 1967?This book will take you back in time and show you The best of the best.Hailed as the best travel writer of her time, Kate simon explored the aspects of Paris that only large expense accounts can provide. Truly an entertaining read for all us daydreamers out there."
5,not a huge fan but loved it!!!,"Like I said, I'm not a huge fan of Depeche Mode but I loved this CD. Also the Walking in your footsteps single!I bought this CD when I was a junior in high school, 12 years ago! Still love it and even replaced it when it was stolen by an old room mate. Easy to listen to and relaxe with."
4,A good song,"Three versions of ""I Feel You,"" and ""One Caress"" make for a good single. All three versions of ""I Feel You"" invoke emotion and the hurt David Gahan must have started going through during his descent in personal appearance and drug addiction. Either way, as singles go, this is as good as it gets...which is pretty promising."
1,Difficult to grant quality while publishing a book eachyear,"I bought this book after reading many reviews, unfortunately I did not like the book at all. The authenticity of Schatz is over, in the book you find photos giving you the feeling of a ""deja vu"". It's a collection of model's books not conveying at all the particular touch Schatz always had in the past.Photography is continuous research, but why trying to have it paid by the money of past admirers, poor readers or collectors, using the name of a past glory? Such a tendency continues, Schatz is now in Milano at the Armani cafè with Athlets, great images, sensuous masses, but the exhibition could be a graduation essay of an Adobe Photoshop class. Bye Howard."
2,too small and flimsy for the price,"it's a beautiful little doll...but seems very small and flimsy. it was stated as being eight inches but that seems to include the pointy cap and there is literally no stuffing to it...i thought there would be a little something but no. there's just not much too it. i was disappointed as i am giving this to my granddaughter to go with her favorite 12 inch soft doll as it's ""baby"" since she has a baby sister coming soon. i don't know if she is going to have much fun with this at all. it's completely over-priced for what it is."
3,small plush doll,"I wanted to buy some unique gifts for my son before he was born and this was one of my purchases. I love it... it is well made, good materials and beautiful. My son could care less about plush toys in general. I can't get him to play with anything except plastic and electronics. A true child of this generation.It's a great toy if your child likes soft objects."
4,"Great ""Nena""","This is like ""Cowboy Cumbia"" in that the three ""Nena"" versions (English, Spanish, and a bilingual mix) are superb. They're catchy and fun to sing along with. The rest of the album is a little average."
5,Very Enjoyable!,"Basically I've never heard of any other songs from eagles than Hotel Calif. until I got this CD..and found out they are such a great band(if not the greatest)!! Vocal is nice, harmony is nice, guitar is nice, everything goes together so nicely. Their music is warm, soothing, full of love, reminds me of those good old times!Thx Eagles!!"
4,A must have for young Eagles fans,"For those of us who were unable to buy the original vinyl records mainly because we were still too little to know what money was, this collection is a must have. The songs are remastered excentlly and though I'm a fan of listening to the original record for quality, I must say that this collection does them justice. The song list itself is the ones I remember growing up with and is a good starting point for younger Eagles fans who do not know the name of the song or possibly who even did the song. All in all I would recommend this album for any Eagles fan."
4,"Great Album, but...","The Eagles are a great American Rock and Roll band. That said, if this is your first Eagles album, it is a great purchase. It is a lot cheaper than the box set and it contains all the essential Eagles material. Having said that, if you are an avid Eagles collector, you might want to save your money. The only new cut on the album is ""Hole in the World.""Now regarding the new track. If you have a problem with music that speaks about war, you will either have a problem with the message of this track or you have an inconsistent thought pattern. The writer of this tune is obviously anti-war, especially with regard to the ""religious"" wars. Aside from the political statement of the song, it is still an Eagles song, which, by definition, means great vocals and instrumentation. If you are a dove, or if you have thick skin, check it out."
5,Very Best of the Eagles,Excellent product and exactly as described. Fast shipment and good value. Very satisfied with purchase.
4,"Great Collection for the Price, Not Perfect","This is a very good collection by a great band, but errs a bit on the side of their megahits versus their best quality. The first two albums get a mere six tracks, truly an injustice. The Eagles were at their country rock best on these two albums, and more of this would have been desirable. Six tracks from the excellent On the Border seems like a lot, but the simply gorgeous ""My Man"" is inexplicably left off, perhaps because Bernie Leadon writer and singer of this track, left after just four albums, and no longer had input. I'd say 4.5 stars actually, but not 5, so I had to give it 4. Still, there's no better collection than this one, and you can always fill things out by buying the early albums."
5,EAGLES,EXCELLENT COLLECTION OF HITS BY THE EAGLES AND GREAT QUALITY RECORDING. IF YOU LIKE THE EAGLES YOU'LL LOVE THIS COLLECTION OF GREATEST HITS. A MUST HAVE FOR ANY EAGLES FAN.
5,The Very Best Of The Eagles,"A compilation of the best Eagles songs on two CDs. If you're missing songs from your collection, or you don't have ANY Eagles CDs, buy this one!"
2,Remastered?,"Someone forgot to tell the person who remastered this album, please leave in the soul. I found this new version a far cry from the quality of sound from the Eagles, that I grew up with. The whole thing sounded weak and very disappointing."
3,I Can't Tell You Why,"First there was Their Greatest Hits. Then there was Greatest Hits, Volume 2, which Don Henley once claimed was an unauthorized attempt by the record company to cash in on The Eagles' catalogue. Then there was the 4-disc Selected Works box set. Now we have this new remastered repackaging.Most of this two CD set is available in the Box Set. The only cuts not there--""Seven Bridges Road"" (which is on GH Vol 2) and the barely listenable ""Hole in the World."" For those listeners new to The Eagles, this is an excellent summary of their work. For those of us who've been following the boys for years, though, I can't tell you why you would want this one."
4,OK but too much from later period,"This is probably the best compilation available but it is far from perfect. How can they leave off Train Leaves Here This Morning, Saturday Night and My Man and include garbage like In The City and These Shoes? I often wonder who puts these things together?????? They really missed a great opportunity here."
5,Classic Music Memories,If at least one track from the Eagles collection doesn't hold a special place in the heart of everyone who lived through their heyday era then they can only be musical somnambulists. This is the ultimate journey through their great music. Highly Recommend!!!
3,"Many years ago, this was one of my favorite groups...","Music is a funny thing. You become emotionally attached to certain songs at certain times, and it often connects you to emotions you were experiencing at the time. Probably, most often, this is songs that made you connect them to somebody you really loved and/or admired at the time. Perhaps you both enjoyed the same songs at the same time, together. Or more often than not, you had a break in a relationship and some song felt ""just like that"". Anyway, back when The Eagles were popular, several of their songs had that emotional connection for me. Listening to them now, as life always changes, that connection is no longer there. The music is still pretty good, but the attachments are gone, reducing the connection to times past. They are good songs, and the music in this collection is certainly worth keeping on my iPod, and once in a while, I click on them and play them again, taking a mild journey down memory lane."
4,Eagles Greatest Hits,"If you love the Eagles, what's not to like? It contains most of their radio hits and it is easy-listening music.."
5,Eagles: The Very Best Of,Can't live without this collection. I am an Eagles fan from way back. No group any better or ever will be.
2,only half way home,"The first disc is full of gems, the second is the crap they did after they changed their sound and sold out. A better buy would be their first, second and third albums. Then they were a band to rival the likes of Poco, Pure Praire League, The Flying Burrito Bros., The Byrds or Gram Parson's as one of the best country rock bands around."
4,Still Soaring After All These Years,"If you're an EAGLES fan, you need this one. I would have likeda few examples from the LIVE in Melbourne concert, but, untilthat is released on CD, this one will do."
1,6 Stars For The Music....,"Negative 5 stars for the corporate greed. The Eagles are one of the best American rock bands, period. But now, like any American ""product"", shuffle around the ingredients, put a new label and someone will buy it. Save your money and get the boxed set used on eBay instead. Look for the ""Absolute Very Best"" of to be released in time for X-mas."
2,The Eagles are okay..but if you want REAL talent...follow along >,"Yeah...I listen to everything.Even rap.When they came up with rap,the ""brotha's"" forgot to add the ""C"" up front.Slight clerical error,I suspect..shooting 50 cent and TuPac takes time..not to mention finding a bullet-proof vest:{The Eagles..I guess they have their place in radio history,had a few hits..sold alot of albums - great.Time to retire.Don Henley is way too political.I don't buy cd's to hear politics...I get the newspaper everyday..I see politics there.Bono...meet Don.""We're musicians..but we feel we have to infect others with our beliefs"" .Maybe it's just me..getting stoned on Rush and Yes.I see past stupidity and weakness...If you want a really good cd..and can concentrate..for a few moments on a musician's abilities - purchase this 1 cd..Jethro Tull - A Christmas AlbumI listen to this in July..it't that good.Tell me I am wrong.I dare you..."
1,Never recieved CD,I was told that the CD I ordered as a Christmas gift was on back order. I tried to cancel the order but was informed that I could not cancel the order. I then purchased the cd elsewhere to make sure I had it in time for Christmas. I still have not recieved the CD or my money back. It has been over a month since I placed the order and I am very disapointed with my Amazon/cdnow experience.
2,"The Eagles----1972-1978....Now, The Don Henley and Glenn Frey Show.","Sorry, folks. But for those of us that go back to the start,The Eagles were, as follows: Henley,Frey,Meisner and Leadon. If you want the definitive collection, stick with the original greatest hits. After Randy Meisner quit, along with Bernie Leadon, The Eagles became The Henley/Frey Duo, with backing musicians.Don't believe it?? Take a long listen to The James Gang and Barnstorm. Then, Poco. Joe Walsh and Tim Schmit are both respectable in their own right. Sadly now, they are relegated to backing up Don & Glen. Even Don Felder was canned by them. For me, they ceased being the innovative group that they once were."
5,An Eagles Album from England,"Went looking for an Eagles song and couldn't believe I didn't have any! Off to Amazon to purchase a best-of Eagles. Humm, most are pretty expensive, but here's one real cheap. Has a long delivery, but for the price, I can wait. The wait was worth it, album arrived a couple weeks earlier than advertised, and was in perfect condition. Thanks"
3,The Eagles,"the quality was not very good - it sounded like the vocals were in one room and the instramentals in another, even when I turned up the volume"
5,Essential Set for Fans Just starting to Fly...,"To start off, what the heck does the FLY on the front cover signify? Or at least that's what it looks like to me - definately NOT an Eagle.Now that that's out of the way, this set is great for beginners getting into the Eagles, or the ""casual fan"" who just wants a good ""best of"" package to get their beak wet.I do agree with another reviewer that the flow of the songs aren't good(ex. New Kid In Town after The Last Resort, Hotel California at the end of CD 1). But the music is and that's what counts. There are a couple of track selections on here that make you scratch your head (ex. Midnight Flyer, Ol' 55, Those Shoes)Songs I would have replaced are: Saturday Night, Outlaw Man, You Never Cry Like A Lover, and The Girl From Yesterday.Otherwise great collection. Remastered YES!!! or at least compared to the first generation CDs that came out in the late 80's."
5,What a collection!,"I have been an Eagles fan since I was 4. My mother loves them and was kind enough to introduce their music to me early in life. This album has it all! There are two tracks that I could do without but other than that, this double disc collection is a comprehensive look at the Eagles and the great music they have made."
4,Excellent,"Eagles fans know this is a superb compulation of selections. This CD is full of songs that listeners will find timeless enjoy. Anyone that love and appreciate some of the best written, performed and recorded music ever, will love this CD."
2,The Very Best Of?,"Put out a boxed set of their first four albums then you will have:The Very Best of the Eagles.Henley, Frey, Meisner, Leadon and Felder.When Joe Walsh came aboard and then Timothy Schmitt I had had enough with the latter mention. ""I Can't Tell You Why? The Eagles?...hardly.The Eagles lost their unique sound with Hotel California."
2,I am very disappointed,"The whole reason i bought this cd was to be able to listen to it in my car. However, it will not play at all in the car. Lower quality cd's and cd's that are made at home quality will not play on my cd player, so I thought by ordering them on Amazon I would get new cd's that were good quality."
4,Do You Like Music?,If you like music then you'll love this CD from Dennis Chambers. It's brilliantly played and produced with a fat bass and drum sound as well as a crackling heat to the horn/guitar lines. There's some great keyboard work happening as well. I am not really sure what it is that they are putting in the water in Gloustershire UK but the previous reviewer (with due respect) needs urgent professional counselling if he can seriously only give this CD one star. There are many ho-hum jazz funk fusion records out there but this ain't ho-hum. The tunes are good and the playing is top notch. What the hell else do you need?
4,BIT OF A LETDOWN,"I had high hopes when I purchased this CD and while it has it's moments I was hoping for more from Dennis. I have seen Dennis with John Scofield, Niacin, and CAB so I know fully well how phenomenal he is on the drums, which is why I expected more. Dennis is a powerhouse drummer with incredible chops and a superb feel for the groove, he can funk it up with anyone.I am more impressed with his work with Mike Stern, Scofield, CAB, Niacin, etc, than I am with what is on this disc. Hopefully next time around Dennis comes out with guns blazing. This is a decent CD but not his best, simple as that. And yes, he still remains one of the most incredible drummers I have ever seen.www.electriceyes.us"
5,It's Grrrrrrreat!,"This is the absolute best drummer of all time. hands, speed, technique, etc. etc. etc....."
3,Genealogy review,Find that this book is very hard to follow when it deals with genealogy. It is hard to find out who is linked with who. For example who is linked to what parents. I find that this book just lists all the people with the name curwin and it's different spellings but doesn't put in into genealogy form to make it easy to follow.
5,perfect long johns,We are using the long johns in a play and we needed them to arrive quickly. They did they are just right.
3,Ok for a joke,The material is thin and the button fell off the first time my daughter worn them. I guess it worked as a joke but not to keep someone warm.
4,The Spy in every kid,My son loves gadgets and sy stuff so this was a nature purchase. He likes it and uses it ... like the other spy gear we own it seems to resurface again and again after sitting for months. The little pieces are sometimes a nuisance.
4,Great Gift!,I ordered this gift for my nephew's Birthday. He loved it! He has played with this Spy Pen so much. Great gift item for the Boy who has everything!!!!
3,Its alright,"I bought this a year ago and thought it was pretty cool. But when I tested it, I found that pen was sorta chunky and sorta hard to wright with. I also found out that the flashlight doesn't work real well when you put on the plastic tip to make it shine at your writing. Every thing else works well except forthe lid to the case. You could open it up with your finger nail instead of using the pretend key thats at the end of the pen. The reason I give this a 3 is because its great for youngsters, as long as you don't spoil it for them."
4,Pretty Good Item,"I would just like to say that this item, is a very fun thing for the kids I have seen play with it, but to me personally, I don't think it has much educational value. But, if you happen to have an adventurous kid, I recomend it."
5,its worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!,i think this is the best spy gear thingy ever. the farther away you are from the item you wish to see you can see it clearer.(scope)the flashlight and the neon tube work good IN THE DARK.motion detector is anooying and sensitve.theres also an extra pen tip and ink thingy all in one.this deserves the ratings i gave it
5,spy pen's great!!!!!!!! get it!!!,"This is the best of spy gear that you can get. it as a motion sensor and it can detect intruders crossing your territory from 20+ feet. there's also a telescope, flashlight, and green tube thingy that bends light so u can write with it in the dark. The case is also cool - it has a lock that no one else can open. It's VERY durable i have dropped the case and/or its contents more than once and it's still working fine.REPEAT: THIS IS THE BEST OF SPY GEAR. GET IT!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Pretty awsome!!!!!,"This toy is pretty awsome!Allthough I do have one complaint.The spy telescope doesn't really work that well.That's were it loses a star.Other than that,its a great toy!If you don't really care about the telescope,get it!"
3,Dont let this toy be in the hands of your younger sibbling!,"This toy has lots of small parts so if you have any young brothers,sisters, or friends,keep the spy pen away from them. (The parts are bound to get lost if you do.)The motion sensor is super sensitive and also super loud.(If you dont want to alert the enemy that the sensor has been triped dont use it.)Also the batterries are very hard to get in.(It took me about 20 minutes to instal them!) Other than that the toy has a great flashlight,telescope, and has a spare ink cartridge.I'd say it would entertain you for about 2 years."
2,DON'T GET IT!!!!!!!!!,"When I first got this toy, I tought it would be fun. When I opened it it told me what to do to put the alarm on. Then when I tried to atatch it, it broke. If you like spy items that won't brake, DON'T GET THIS TOY!"
5,"cool, very cool",this is a very good toy if you are thinking about getting this then GET IT. if you think this is not a good spy toy your crazymy piont is get it.
1,um....no,"look like half my family has one of these, the small few who it didnt break on the first day, say that it was terrible and too compiced. i have never purchesed one but i have had one for a period of time. if you wont a motion detetor get the little on they sell for (...) and als far as lisning goes get the supersonic ear. these aculy work alittle GOOD LUCK make the right dision"
5,Cool,I don't have this toy but I have read the reviews to it and found out that it is pretty cool.I gave this Five Stars because I saw it in Target.P.S.Don't forget to review this review!
4,THE BEST SPY TOY EVER,It is a great toy .you can eisley slip it into your pocket and you can eisley replace the battaries. it has a wonderful telescope and comes with extra ink.it has a flashlightthat works wonderful. I think you should buy it because THIS IS THE BEST SPY TOY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Horrable,My friend and I got these and the sets are really bad!! The pen doesn't work and the flashlight went out right away. The alarm is really loud! And when we locked it we couldn't get it back open so we had to force it open. This is not a durable toy at all. If you have the option to buy it DON'T!! You will be upset with it.
4,"Yes, grab it (if you can get it)!","Definitely worth the buy. Streisand fans hardly get the fun to get ""B"" sides, outtakes from Barbra's albums, so this is a double treat. Besides the duet, the two extra songs not included on ""A Love Like Ours"" are good and in the same vein ot the album. ""Just Because"" is very very sweet & ""Lets Start Right Now"" is more classical in its approach, laid back, Ellington style. Both well arranged. Also Barbra's vocals are very relaxed, not forced. If these songs had appeared on the album, it probably would have made it to long - but a shame not everyone will hear them."
4,Does exactly what it should,"There really isn't anything special to say about this one.- Video shielding works great, no problems with CRT-TV's or nearby magnetic fields- Easy connection jacks on the back accommodate nice, thick speaker cables- Sound output is good compared to the rest of a sound system; the mids are appropriate for voice in center channelIt could have come with a back-mounting option to hang it from a wall or entertainment center wall. Good for the price!"
4,Done!,"Puchased this speaker to complete my surround system which consists of 4 bose 161's, a Mirage sub and a Kenwood reciever. The LS300 blends in perfectly and does a great job of playing back dialouge from my live concert dvds, movies and cd's. The only reason its not a five star is because it is hefty and is not configured for wall mounting. Great product, great price!"
4,AudioSource LS300-C Video Shielded Center Channel Speaker,Is a nice looking a good center channel dialog speaker. The price was right and the delivery was right on schedule.As usual I've had no problem with using Amazon or any of it's vendors. I use them and highly recommend them to anyone that purchases electronic equipment for home theater use or computer peripherals.John J.President Masters Hockey Association(since 1963)
4,A Must Read,"BOOJUM is not your typical tale of good versus evil. Dan Skelton's book grips you with it's icy fingers from the very first page. He has accomplished with his novel, BOOJUM, a heart stopping story of terror, so frightening, that although your stomach churns, you cannot put the book down. You are compelled to turn the next page. The evil entity in this book ranks up there with the worst. If you like Stephen King, you'll love Dan Skelton's book BOOJUM - Cynthia Hickey, author of Pursued by Evil."
5,"There's nowhere to go, nowhere to hide from BOOJUM","Don't think you are going to get away unscathed. Dan Skelton won't let you. His book, BOOJUM, is an incredible ride of terror which makes you gasp, cringe and run for the nearest locked room while begging for your life. The locked room won't save you. Boojum knows you are there.I don't read a lot of horror novels but I will from now on, especially if Dan Skelton is the author. Why he's not on someone's best seller list is a complete mystery.BOOJUM is an outstanding read."
5,Star Wars X-Wing Fighter Red Leader by Hasbro,"My son received this toy from his grandparents. He LOVES it. I only wish the toy came with an R2 unit. You can buy the R2 action figure to slide in the slot, but until you have that, it just doesn't look right.I'm a little concerned about the durability of the wings. You can have it in attach mode, or x-wing mode. Time will tell how well that feature holds up.Overall, really, really cool."
4,Need to have,"As a pilot with over 25 years of flight experience, I found this book an excellent supplement to the Warrior's flight manual. The illustrations put the aircraft systems into prospective, and give an overall insight into the aircraft's operation.I would recommend this book and the other books of this series to any pilot -- regardless of experience -- who is looking to have a check ride in a particular aircraft. These books even serve as a refresher if you haven't flown the aircraft in a few years, and you want to get reaquinted with it."
3,Before you buy...,"This was not the same as the mirror I was replacing in that mine was a foldaway and heated, and so the wiring was different.Also, on my 300M 2004, to replace the mirror you have to really take apart the door, and remove a waterproof cover over the wiring that needs to be replace with an adhesive to restore the seal.So I opted to just remove the wire from the old mirror and hook up the three necessary wires into the new harness, taping off the useless heater wires.So, you need a much more expensive mirror for some cars, or rig it, and either way, it is not just a matter of ""bolting on the new one"" but pretty involved. Still, I did it all in the evening.I scratched up the side of my car a bit, too, in the process.Consider carefully whether you want to bite into all this before you get started!"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this bag a few years ago and was happy with the look when I received it. The main reason I purchased it was for the ""clip-lok"" feature. It looked like a nice feature and I liked the idea of my clubs staying locked in place. Unfortunately - the clubs don't stay locked in place and I found it very annoying to continually be trying to clip them back in where they should be. So, this bag now sits in my basement & I've moved on to a much nicer one - nothing like this one, that really doesn't perform as advertised!"
3,Okay,"I have a beard and do not need to shave every day. I find that this razor is convenient in that you can clean it just by running it under water, but it does not give me a close enough shave in comparison to a regular razor. I need to go back and forth over my neck many times, and it never cuts the hairs close to my Adam's Apple close."
2,So uncomfortable!,This headset was so uncomfortable when I put it on that I took it off IMMEDIATELY and didn't even bother to see if it was any good for voice recognition which is what I bought it for. I'm sending it back.
3,"Good sound, but uncomfortable.","I am using this to video message through Skype. We were having really bad sound interference. These really helped cut that down. The sound quality is pretty good & the mic works very well. I do have 2 complaints. I am a girl & ordered these partially because I liked the white color, but when they arrived I got a black pair. I think that picture is misleading! The other complaint is that they are really uncomfortable. I wear glasses & it hurt my ears after just a short time. I didn't say anything because glasses can cause that issue, but then my 3 year old used them to talk. He also complained that they hurt his ears. The sound quality is pretty good & works for what I need, but I have already replaced them with the same kind that I bought for my husband."
3,Not horrible,"The mic itself is actually quite decent, however, the headset is damned uncomfortable after more than, say, 10 minutes."
4,great stuff,I have used it and results are very satisfactory more that i expected.great soung output that it has and which went along with what i wanted..
5,A great buy,We bought this headset to replace one that the kids had worn out. This is a very high quality headset with great sound. It was well worth the money spent for it. So much so that we ordered another one not too long ago.
4,Would recommend,Found this book very helpful and have used it several times when choosing colour schemes. Several friends have since bought the book.
4,Great Relief,"I have gluten sensitivity. I do not have full blown Celiac Disease. When I eat gluten, I itch, in places you do not want to itch. It is really bad. This product takes away those symptoms. It is especially effective if taken immediately after ingesting the gluten containing food. However, it is not a total cure. Like others say, I should totally avoid all gluten. But this is reality, and there are chocolate chip cookies and brownies and miscellaneous mysterious gluten containing foods in reality, so when I fail, this product comes to my rescue. It is the only thing I know that works and I totally depend on it."
1,Give me break,"This is a total waste of time. If a friend GIVES you this ""film"" to watch he is no friend at all.There is no redeeming value here what so ever.Terrible acting coupled with unattractive people who would serve us better by keeping their clothes on and absolutely no script at all.I live in Brooklyn and now even the title now embarrasses me.In case I was not clear this DVD was not very good."
1,What I recall,"The initial shows--they were a product of the era, and that era of cartoon animation contained guns, bombs idiots and falling anvils. They were rough and scrappy, not the overwrought slicked up pretension of PC they are today. But we know crap sells.I recall the vivid Witch Doctor video. Someone worked on that one, because the visual parade of authentic Tribal masks were educational and brain candy.Pity they had to go and sweeten up the Chimpmunks."
1,I dont know,"I didnt receive this dvd...they sent me the movie of alvin and the chipmunks, not the one I wanted...I wanted this one...."
3,Semi-deceptive advertising,"The title says it... The very first Alivin show-and that's all you get-just the first episode of the original series. I should have looked a little closer at the contents. I was expecting to get the whole series, which only lasted one season, then was re-run for years. The quality is very good- the picture and sound are well done, but I was left wondering why they didn't sell all of the series instead of the first show. I always liked this version better than the later versions, probably because this is the one I grew up with. By the time the other one came out, I was in my twenties and there was no attraction. Still, it was good to experience some childhood memories again, and to see Clyde Crashcup again."
3,60s Alvin 4 stars. 80s/90s Alvin -1 star,"My 4 and 6 y/o totally geek out for Alvin and the Chipmunks thanks to Alvin/Chipmunks and A/C-Squeakuel. So, I thought this would be a good way to share with them something from my youth that they would like. The first Alvin Show holds up VERY well. It's Funny. The animation still looks good. Then we get to the rest of the dvd. It is some dreck from the 80s and 90s and frankly for anyone older than 8, it is entirely unwatchable.So, for a 90 min dvd there are 25 brilliant minutes and an hour plus of pain. More Alvin Show on DVD please! Less 80s filler crap."
1,Misrepresentation,"After this long you would think they could at least release this show in its entirety and not play with us. I was very dissappointed. They could have at least put the Chipmunk Song on here. Oh well, back to YouTube."
1,So when is the real and entire first season coming !??,I was very disappointed - got all settled in to watch classic episodes that I remember from the early 60s only to find that I got one great episode and the rest that 80s stuff !
4,Nostalgic group vocals from the big band era,"A delightful collection of vocal tunes recorded between 1937-1948 by a gospel group gone pop, following very much in the footsteps of the Mills Brothers and Ink Spots. There's also a trace of hipster jive, ala Slim & Slam, on nonsense numbers such as ""Calliope Jane,"" ""The Mumble Song,"" and the hepcat novelty number, ""Open, The Door Richard."" The group excelled at slicked-up, sweetened versions of cover tunes, and had a big hit in 1940 with ""So Long,"" one of many fine oldies included in this 24-song set, including '40s pop standards such as ""We'll Meet Again,"" ""I Got It Bad,"" and the like. It may take a while to settle in on this band's wavelength, which is closer to the corny sentiment of the sweet band era than to the postwar R&B scene which eventually displaced them. But for nostalgia fans, whether you like tricky harmonies or vocalese, or just dig the corniness of old-school showbiz, this is a really fun record. Recommended!"
5,President John Kerry-bravery in action,"See this movie and see where our next President has been and how he looks at the world. He doesn't see the world in simplistic black and white, the back slapping cowboy impersonation, reducing everything to the lowest common denominator.Kerry sees wrong as try to right them, without feeling that it a sign of weekness to say this is the wrong path.The movie's beautifully done, a thought provoking look at then and of now. It should be shown in schools all over the country to show our young that it is unnessary to go blind into the world and the voting booth."
5,Sets the Record Straight,"Amoung the smears, fears and distortions of the 2004 presidential campaign, the most shameful episode is that of trying to discredit the honorable Viet Nam service of John Kerry. How the Bush campaign was able to turn a man who pulled out all stops to avoid serving his country into the ""honorable warrior"", at the same time trying to destroy a true hero who served his country with honor, is one for the textbooks when it comes to sleeze. IF you enjoy fiction, read the book ""Unfit for Command""....... if you enjoy the truth, please view this DVD."
1,Misguided Mind,"The anti-war rhetoric that Kerry spewed was fed to our P.O.W.s as they suffered at the hands of their captors. They used his words and others like him (Hanoi Jane) to try to propagandize our heroes that the country was against all they had suffered for. Hate Bush, if that's your thing, but don't give this disgrace to patriotism any kudos for causing further damage to what was a terrible tragedy. There's a reason that there's a veterans against Kerry group. It's better to remain silent and be thought stupid, than to talk and remove all doubt. A lesson he will obviously never learn."
2,Interesting to see how any behavior can be justified,"Clearly, Kerry sees himself as heroic in any endeavor. This DVD while interesting shows the extent that someone with limited, perhaps no moral substance, can be promoted into something more than they are via editing. A large portion of the global audience suffers from the lack of critical thinking, and assumes anything in print or in media must be true. Kerry may be the greatest shame ever pulled on the American public by the media. More than anything it shows the power of visual persuasion, and challenges that America will continue to face as we gain our entire understanding of life through sound bites on TV."
5,"The Opinionated Laymen's Guide to Science, The Universe, God","I really like this author's book and website. He is opinionated, or rather, he offers his opinions on some of life's big questions while at the same time is scientific. Where science has something to say then science should be heard, where science is silent, then he offers what he thinks.Surprisingly enough, I happen to agree with ""most"" of his opinions! And he has a deep respect for science, and so do I. This is a very entertaining book that will challenge you, inform you, offer insightful opinions and then leave the outcome to you."
3,worth it,"Feed the Tree is by far the best belly single to be released...it's catchy, the lyrics draw you in, and well, yes, it's lite music, but fun too! check it out."
4,A very challenging album,"I first heard about this album in a Village Voice review. I can honestly say that this is one of the most unique and challenging albums that I have ever heard. A fan of more experimental music, I initially found Detach very difficult to listen to. Although the more I listened to it, the more I began to appreciate the uniqueness of their sound. It's encouraging to see that there are still bands who are willing to take risks."
5,The book is very informative & the sketches are terrific,"I really enjoyed the way Mr. Pantas was so descriptive with the land marks & area.There seems to be so much to see & do in the western part of NC. The book is very informative, and easily read.The sketches are very realistic. I bought the first edition on a visit to NC two years ago,& needless to say I had to have the new second edition this year. Thank you Lee James Pantas for giving me the insight of a very lovely part of our country. My husband & I were able to explore the section of that area very easily through yur book.Sincerely,Roylene Rosell"
1,A GREAT DISSAPPOINTMENT,I expected a DVD movie with actors. This is a book put on a screen. If I wanted that I would use Kindle. I really would have preferred the book to this.WHAT A RIP-OFF!I was not prepared for what I got!Ellen
5,One of the Best Books I've read!,This book is truly one of the best books I have ever read. A great story very well told of a arms dealer. The story spans his whole life and is one of those books that is hard to put down. I first read this book years ago and I HAD to buy it to re-read. It's a book I recommend for both men and women.
2,note the size,"Cute book, but make sure you note the size. this book is no more than the stated 3x5. I didn't even look at that part of the description, so it was my fault. Just make sure you're aware of that."
5,Table Talk,As a Border Collie owner I just find this series of books just right to enjoy on a cold evening when just a quick read takes you 'away' from the days thoughts. A book for all ages of Border Collie lovers.
4,"Good Value, Great book!","Our local library did not have this book in circulation for my daughter to read as part of her literature lesson so we ordered it. She loved the story. She is in first grade. It was challenging enough phonetically without being too hard, so she was able to read it herself. We are glad to make it part of our library."
5,One of the best rock n' roll albums ever...,"Definately NOT punk rock... this is much better... rock n' roll that makes you wanna jump and down, that makes you wanna scream along, that makes you wanna start a band so you can scream even louder. This album fills you with energy, and you won't get sick of it. It's gonna be in my record player for a long time..."
3,VERY little book for the money.,"While the patterns are nice in this book, I neglected to really look to see size of the book. Honestly, all the other quilt/sewing books I have are quite full and contain many, many pages. I was shocked when this book arrived as a simple 24 page ""booklet."" There are many, many other books that are around the same price giving much, much more in terms of content. (Beginners Luck being one such book.) Honestly, I have to give it three stars for the color photos and the well written instructions, but it lacks, and big time, actual projects."
2,I WOULD LIKE THE ORIGINAL SONG ON CD .... THANK ..YOU,WHERE CAN I GET A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL SONG ...IN THE YEAR 2525...ON CD STAR DATE11.18.1999
1,Why build a better mousetrap?,"This remix is terrible. :( The original [Zager & Evans] was beautifully and passionately done. This version is a cheesy techno mix that falls short of any real talent. Please buy the original. Or listen to the remix by Visage. Or even, watch Cleopatra 2525 to get a better version."
3,Totally Different Card Reader Than Pictured & Description,"What is pictured is a compact USB pen style card reader. What arrived was a small rectangular multi-card reader that requires a USB mini-cable [which was included]. The card reader does work, but is not very stable. Any movement of the USB cable or the reader and the computer loses connectivity and then starts over, then loses it, then starts over. If everything stays perfectly still it works and reads my SDHC cards with out errors. I hope it lasts, it seems very poorly made."
1,Unreliable,"I use this reader on a Mac, plugging it into the USB 2.0 port directly, no hubs. The MS Duo card mounts for a few moments, usually enough to transfer a few pics, then abruptly unmounts..It may just be my unit, but I'll play it safe and get a name-brand reader."
2,Shame on me for not reading the the description better!,"I purchased this thinking that I could use this for my sony sticks and sd cards. The usb stick WILL NOT work with sd! I just saw the 20 in 1 heading and skimmed through the description. Lesson learned, don't shop in a hurry."
1,Nothing New,There is nothing enlightening about this book. It's basically common sense information that doesn't require a book purchase. I breezed through it because it had nothing new to offer. Now it's collecting dust on my book shelf.
5,"A very, very good resource","This was one of the first books I purchased for my riding library five years ago; at age 33 I was a rank beginner just starting lessons, and I wanted to supplement the physical experience with some off-the-horse studying. Today it's pretty dog-eared, which reflects how often I've gone back to it. It covers just about every aspect of riding one can think of(the aids, body awareness, feel, creative imagery to help position, psychology-even proper attire and tack!), and is written clearly and concisely, never getting dull or overly technical(wish I could say the same for some of the others I've shelled out for). It is also very reasonably priced-a good ""value for money"", as the british say, which is why I've rated it so highly. I would give it as a gift to any novice, adult or otherwise."
5,A great read for anyone interested in barbecue and humor!,"If you love barbecue, the south and need a guide to great barbecue in Alabama, this is a must read. It is an excellent reference guide while traveling the state of Alabama or if you are looking for another barbecue restaurant in your hometown.It is easy to read and the book has several cross references and maps to assist you in your search for the ""heavenly BBQ."" The publication also is easy to read and to understand.We keep ours in our car for emergency use when craving smoked meats of any kind."
4,Under Shakespeare's Shadow.,"Ben Jonson is a great writer who's only mistake must be to have been born at the same time as the great Shakespeare. Full of satire and sexual innuendos, The Alchemist narrates the tale of two rogues, one the alchemist who promises people to turn all their items to gold and the other his helper. Matched with a prostitute who fools around with them it makes a comic tale of lust and greed."
3,Decent shelf but some issues,"The first shelf I bought from Amazon was majorly damaged. The shipping box was completely intact but the inside box was destroyed. Amazon was VERY helpful in dealing with the exchange. This shelf looks nice. However I have two problems with it. First, bubble type wine goblets don't fit well in there (I have Mikasa Cheers red wine balloon goblets). I can get 2 in each row, but they don't sit straight. The second problem was that the shelf would not install flush to the wall. Installing it per the instructions made it sag downward, even with nothing in the racks or on the shelf. We had to alter it slightly to get it installed properly. So overall, it's OK. I had a hard time finding a decent shelf that wasn't super-expensive, but I guess you get what you pay for..."
1,wine shelf,When I received this product the box was damaged and obviously opened. The product itself was also damaged. There was no paperwork and the unit is potentially missing pieces.
3,"Ehhh... interesting, but...","I bought this product to use in my classroom while teaching The Crucible to 11th grade students. It held their attention for about 5 minutes. Some of the information is interesting, but most of it I already knew and/ or found out in my research to teach the book. Bottom line is this: if you like the History Channel, you will like this DVD. If not, look at something else."
2,If you know anything about the salem witch trials already then you probably don't need to watch this,"My husband downloaded this for me to watch, and frankly I have read about the salem witch trials before so it really wasn't that great. Most of the stuff that it covered were things that anybody who has heard about the trials already know. It gives more dates and stuff like that but for the most part if you know anything about the trials you don't need to watch this one. Slightly disappointing."
3,Dry and a bit boring,"I bought this DVD as a compantion piece to The Cruicible that we were watching in English III. I thought it was important to show what really happened in history compared to Miller's fictional classic. I had not expected that this historical DVD could so quickly eliminate much of the interest that the Cruicicle had generated. Surely, this bit of our American history could have been presented accurately AND in an interesting way."
4,An underappreciated wit!,"I loved A. Whitney Brown during his time on Saturday Night Live, and ""The Big Picture"" delivers the same wit, insight, comedic timing and irrascableness that only Brown can dish out. If you like smart commentary on important political issues, this is the book to have - you'll laugh AND you'll think."
5,Great,"Good stuff. Buy it or I'll shank you! (Though I may be a bit biased, being family and all...Oh well.)"
5,Josie,"I am a die-hard Flintstones fan and always have been. From the gagets to the knuckle headed behavior of Fred himself. The episode that gives a nod to Alfred Hitchcock is especially enjoyable. These are highly entertaining cartoons you can put on for the kiddos without going bonkers yourself. In fact, you'll probably find yourself sitting down right with them to share the laughs. Go for it!"
2,not a good chair,"I bought this chair two months ago and the left armrest has broken. I have to say this chair is very fragile.Besides, I called them one month ago and they said they will mail a new arm; however, I haven't get that....In conclusion, bad product, not recommanded."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this chair a little over a month ago, and already my left armrest has broken in half. Contacted about getting a replacement, and told that I was out of luck.Complete waste of money, stay away"
1,Pressure release mechanism malfunctioned,"I've had this approximately a year. I use it 1 to 2 times a month. Now when I measure the pressure of my tire, the gauge seeps air immediately. I now have to buy another one. I've seen other reviews with the same issue so it probably depends on your luck if you get a defective unit or not."
5,jaclopastic,It is a very good piece of equipment. I would think everyone should have one. I use it alot around the house.
1,not for semi trucks,if you getting it for semi truck you can not get reading from inner tire because of the angle of the tire gauge
4,Works as it should,"Nice solid construction. Measures psi a lot higher than normal gauges. My only grip is that the angle of the nozzle makes it a little awkward to seat it properly on a tire valve. I guess I would have preferred it to be either straight or right angled, but that's just me."
1,Very Inaccurate,"Just got my unit the other day, and compared the reading to 3 of my other gauges. This unit read 31# while my others were in the 36.5-37.0# range. Mine is going back as soon as I can get it out. BTW, it smells awful -- don't bring it in your house. Not a good choice -- at least for me."
3,It is what it is...,I only bot this cuz of the $7 price. The accuracy given its very large range (10-160) was off. If you need something very accurate this is not it.
1,Pressure Release Failed After First Use,"Right out of the package I used it first on the front tire of my bike and the gauge and pressure release worked fine and then I used it on the back tire and the pressure gauge read zero. The release malfunctioned after the first use, so the dial would go back to zero right after you pulled the gauge off the tire. I put it back in the box and returned to Amazon.com immediately! I do NOT recommend!"
5,Excelent choice and excelent product. Great deal. Thanks!!!,This item is a very nice equipmet and practical for my car. Is and excelent product with great capacity to work.I recomend this item.
2,Pressure Release DOA,"Right out of the package the pressure release was broken, and when I tried to use the gauge it never moved from zero. I put it back in the box and returned to Amazon. I was kind of disappointed because the overall quality of the guage doesn't seem bad... I guess it's just hit or miss if you get a good one."
2,did not register the pressure accurately,I use it for my dual back tires in a Ford 350 chassis. It would not register the tire pressure accurately. It was hard to get a tight seal around the valve stem. I will try the CH tire inflater with the built in gauge and the chuck that hopefully will get a tight seal on the valve stem.
4,Solid gauge at a good price,"What can I say...great price and free super saver shipping. I like that it has a built in rubber casing for the gauge, a long flexible tubing, and solid connection tmeasure the tire pressure.The first time I used it, I found that 1 of my tires was slightly lower on pressure (just 2 psi less), and then investigating further, I found it had a nail in it. With lower quality gauges, I wouldn't have picked up this small difference."
1,Air Leak,It does not keep the air to allow you to read it after you take it off the tire. It simply leaks air. Do not buy it.Ordered mine March 28 and so I am over my grace period for returning it. I did not use it immediately after getting it. How silly of me.
2,average,"The book has a lot of example of automation but it is not really clear and to the point. But, overall it is a good book to have :p"
2,Microsoft Windows Administrator's Automation Toolkit review,I found the content to be light on. Most of this suff is well documented on the web and most admins would find it in minutes. Took me about 30 minutes to go through and doubt I will ever open it again.
5,Excellent Read,"I have read many, many Cassie Edwards' books in her 'Savage Series', and they have all been wonderful!!"
4,Udo's Oil,the taste was not really great but i do feel much better since i have been taking it for the past 6 months
1,Udo's Choice Oil Blend,"I'm sorry, I don't know if I would feel as great as the others who take this product regularly.It tastes so awful, I can't get it down. Tried mixing it in a cottage cheese dish, tastes bad. And tried it in H20 to drink it, still taste bad, and tried swallowing a teaspoon straight, uck!Sorry, I wish I could stomach it.I will not waste it, I will add it to my dogs dry food and see if they like it!It is good for their skin and fur!"
3,Good product -- little pricey,"Since I bought this as a gift for someone else, I can only take her word for it that the price for the quantity was a bit high.As far as the quality of the product and how she feels? She loves it!"
5,universal message,"This book, written by a Rabbi and forwarded by a Catholic priest, contains a universal message that all can hear. By taking examples from Bible stories and bringing them to present everyday life in short story form, Greenberg shows us how to live happier, more productive lives. His passages are humorous, touching, and every sentence is like poetry. It's a pity this book didn't get the marketing it deserved. It's nothing short of a treasure."
1,"Worst Album Yet, Not The Real Dope","Don't get me wrong, Dope is a great band; on all their other CD's. This one is like Dope gone limp. If you think Dope is a little hard, get this album, it may be perfect. By far their best album is American Apathy, which kicks ass. This album has one good song, which is Burn, but you can get a better version on American Apathy. Hopefully Dope doesn't produce another album like this one, this one is almost like teenage punk rock which goes against their earlier CDs and doesn't match their music style. I have all their CDs, then decided to purchase this one, I was let down to say the least. Their softest album yet."
2,Back to antics,"I love Dope's music. Their music, I like. The lyrics, everyone knows, needs a lot of working on. It's often repetitive-and more so than Static-X (which I am a huge fan of), which even though some of their songs are a few lines spread it out and make it bareable for a few listens.This album has some things going for it, however. It's some-what cohesive. ""Group Therapy""-the lyrics representitve here are that of madness becoming. None of the songs feel out of place, either. So I really don't see anything wrong with this album except for the repetitious and mind numbingly simple lyrics.But unfortuantely that's enough to kill it's ability to become a staple among industrial metal fans. This album is definitely left for the hardcore Dope fan, or someone who likes industrial metal and has the ability to tune out the person singing. It's sad really, I think Edsel has one of the most unique voices out there today too."
2,Disappointed,"Although lagging behind, I was very much looking forward to this album as I thoroughly enjoyed Felons & Revolutionaries. This one, however, seems to lack the spark of their first. They appear to have retained the inadequacies, and dropped their funky side - making them a bit boring. This album is not a write off, but I would definitely advise giving it a few full listens before buying it."
2,not so dOpE,Ive never heard any other dope albums but I hope this is the worst because it lacks effort and talent. Poor lyrics that I could have written and not so technical guitar playing. What kind of song is B*tch. Decent drums. Poor effort.NOt worth listening to but i probably will anyway and end up liking it. heh
5,Some may need therapy after listening,"Pop and rap listeners that is. I love this album, and i hold it like a peice of gold. It isn't the hardest or craziest album i've ever heard, of course not, but everything within it is great music. You've got some good nu-metal/rock, plus great vocals and audio ferocity, what more can you ask? Personally i think Felons and Revolutionaries is their best release, but thats not to say this isn't as well. Bitch is just a great song, Burn is a brutal song (equal to the likes of die mf die), and other songs like Sing, or Another Day Goes By are very good slow songs. I think it all fits together like one fancy jigsaw puzzle, all the peices alligned perfectly with a purpose. You should buy this album, because it is great music."
3,What happened.....,"When I first encountered Felons and Revolutionaries I was amazed. I listened to it over and over and each time the music spoke to me, moved me; it made me bang on the steering wheel as I drove to work and picture all the people I owed a beating. Then they put out Life and I thought ""Wow, this is a pitiful effort"" - listened to it a few times and now I can easily forget that I own it. It just did not have that same spark. Finally along comes Group Therapy...I had high hopes but was concerned. Some songs here have the spark - such as ""Motivation"" - but much of it seems a strained and unsuccessful attempt to get back to the level of F&R. I wonder what happened...they seem to have lost something along the way."
4,the evolution of dope,"i think its a really good album. they have just evolved with there music slightly.when i first became accustomed to dope, was when felons and revolutionaries came out and i built my impression around that. so too me, life was a big disappointment. i actually think this album gets back to where the first one left off, probably better compared to life, as they have basically the same type of ""new dope"" sound."
3,half life,"Good cd, but not as good as their previous effort ""life"". This cd proves that dope is still a good band that manages to bring energy ,anger and emotions at the same time. Good riffs and some killer tracks. If it was a debut album I would have rated it 4 stars without a doubt, but I own both ""felons and revolutionaries"" and the huge ""life"" so I was expecting more from dope. Don't get me wrong I enjoy listening to this cd and if you liked their first two albums I think you'll like 'group therapy' too."
3,"Awesome Band, OK Album","Dope is an awesome band, the songs they make are great additions to the world of hard rock. Unfortunatly I didn't dig this album as much as I liked the first two and American Apathy. If your buying the album for the song Bitch don't bother there is another version on the American Apathy album and I thought it was a better cut."
4,Very good,"I liked this one. It has a great variety of music styles. It's not perfect, but still a very good one."
5,the best,ive been listening to theses guys and the murderdolls for a long time.and to tell you the truth theses guys are way better.edsel is crazyat singing.i think that the dolls and dope should tour with static x.that'd be cool
4,A far cry of the revolution,"Although very different from their first commercial effort, ""Felons and Revolutionaries"", this is still a commendable album. With such melodic songs as ""sing"", and ""easier"", the band has matured into a very good group."
1,NOT what you see,I ordered this product but when I got it it is not what you see in the picture !!!!!!
2,No difference in growth,"With the title Super Gro you would think it speak for itself. Not a change in growth, Im aware that you cant become Rapunzel over night, but using this for months at time my hair maintained the same length, Ironically it started growing once I switched to another product."
1,Do not buy....,"This will damage your head..I recommend pls. do not buy this ink cartridges, rather buy the original ones or OEM ones."
3,"Great shows, bad tape","If you're a fan of the Ozzie and Harriet show, you will love these episodes. Unfortunately, Madacy is one of those companies that puts out low quality product. Both tapes in the set were recorded in SLP mode, meaning the sound and picture aren't nearly as good as they should be. If you can overlook that flaw, the shows are a lot of fun to watch. The first ep, Father's Night at the Frat, has Dave and Rick's fraternity trying to raise money to build a swimming pool. Rick sings ""Mighty Good"" in this ep. The second ep, The Frat Rents a Room, features Wally Cox as a professor who tortures his students with tough assignments. It only gets worse when he moves into a room at the frat house. David and the Teenager concerns a neighbor girl who becomes quite fond of David - who, by this time, is happily married. The Nelsons Decide to Move is probably the funniest of these shows, with a hilarious dream sequence where Ozzie imagines he and Harriet moving into an apartment."
4,A definitive work marred by its presentation,It seems churlish to criticise what is undoubtedly a definitive reference book with a remarkable format: not a word of print appears anywhere - all the text (including the forward and the publication details) is handwritten and photo-reproduced. The sadness is that the author has limited ability as a cartographer and graphic designer. His use of colour is inept and the maps - which are intended as things of beauty - look cramped and amateurish. But it is a treasure store of information collected in one place and the author must be given credit for his industry and organisation.
1,"lies, lies, lies!","The title of the book about Edison should have been ""The world greatest opportunist who would stop at nothing to make a buck, including stealing ideas of others!"" But I guess kids need heroes and not the truth; yet its nauseating to see a man who held progress of science down (tried to discredit alternating currents by publicly electrocuting animals) being called the world's greatest inventor. If you want to learn about real talented inventor, read about Nicola Tesla.I'm sure few years from now Anna Sproule will write a book titled ""Bill Gates: The world's greatest inventor."""
3,Looks good but not high quality,"Positive:The stands match and look great with the Micra-6 satellite speakers.Negative:The manufacturing seems a little cheap. A bracket on each stand to support the speaker didn't quite fit on top of the tube. Plus the speakers wobble on top of the stands.Overall, I'm happy with these for my set up because the stands are off to the sides of the room in relatively inconspicuous locations. If I was using these for front speakers, I would probably go with something of higher quality."
4,Ay! El Amor,"This is a very good album with the biggest names in Cumbia today. Some of these tracks contain the ""Cumbia/Andina"" label next to the track title which is rare to find in other compilation albums. If you like Cumbias as much as I do...please add this to your collection."
3,Somewhat good,"Good combination of vocal trance and hard techno, but some songs sounded to relax for me to consider it Dance music."
5,"I laughed, I cried, I cried some more.","This book rocks. Willis Wegner watched the Cubs for a whole season and managed to tell a sane, hilarious story about what could have been. God I'm tired of the ""loveable Cubbies"" books. This one looks a bunch of bums square in the face and calls them out. Between now and the eventual Cubs world champion (circa 2038), this is the defining Cubs book you need to read. Bye?"
4,"noisier, weaker, less air flow than metal register","5-year old steel registers in our coastal home were beginning to rust.These cannot rust, but flex appreciably more than metal ones being replaced.These also have less open area, and air rushes through them more noisily."
2,Just Like the Tutorial,"The information in the book is a subset of that in the manual, downloadable for free, from cliekteam's web site. The author seems to mimick the same examples as clickteam (as far as TGF is concerned). The manual created by clickteam is better. The authors examples do not even really run that well and I do not think it is a function of TGF as I have created much better games myself with little or no effort."
4,Great for beginners,"If you want to get into making games but don't know where to start, this book is really really helpful in teaching you the basics of making a game without learning much programming. You can learn to make simple games at home, and it's pretty simple once you get the hang of it. It's a perfect introduction to making games. The only problem is if you want to go further, you can't save stand alone games or internet games. Still, it's awesome for people with no experiance."
2,Awesome Game Creation,I bought this book thinking it was a full game creater onlyto find out it was only find out it's not the full version and you have to go online to register this game only to find nothing on the web site to register it on.you will see Games Factory Screen on start up.you will not be able to save stand alone gamesyou will not be able to make screen saves or internet games +i am a bit disappointed.
1,Unreliable and awful warranty service,"I purchased a Euro-Pro machine for my wife for Christmas 2002. The reviews sounded good: Metal construction, 8 layers of denim, etc. CAUTION: Don't believe the hype!It's now September, 2003, and as far as we know, her machine is somewhere in Champlain, New York being serviced. The machine never really worked properly, and Euro-Pro customer service was unreachable, unresponsive, and just plain not helpful. After several torturous exchanges by email, Euro-Pro finally told us to send the machine to them. That was seven weeks ago.I feel awful because my wife is so frustrated. I know I'm going to end up buying the Singer, Brother, or White machine I should have bought to begin with. I don't know what I'll do with the Euro-Pro when it comes back.BEWARE: Learn from my mistake. Before you buy, contact the company to check their service. Buy a more reputable brand. Good luck!"
1,no stars here,"This is perhaps one of the worst CDs I have ever heard. The singer has a good voice, but the lyrics are muffled, the arrangements tacky and dull, and the pace of each song on the CD is lugubriously slow.My rating is totally thumbs down. I tried to rate it ""no stars"" but I was prompted to ""Please rate this item."" That's the only reason I gave it one star."
5,An Intriguing Read,"I am a tea drinker. I've visited the UK twice and picked up the habit while there, so when I spotted this book at the library I thought it looked very interesting. The author actually worked in Africa for 13 years, and has personal experience as a British manager of a tea plantation. In the book he recounted a brief history of British tea trade with China, India, and Africa. The names of several types of tea were explained, since they come from geographic regions. From a slow start to a nationwide addiction, he followed the growth of tea drinking in Britain. The history of the four big British tea companies were explained, including a little bit about Twinings. The process of growing tea is over-viewed, including the good and bad of British colonial rule. Several maps were included which were very helpful, and the appendix on differentiating types of tea was interesting. A must read for any tea addicts."
4,WAR TOY LOVER,I purchased this set for my son. He really enjoys anything that has to do with war and military strategy. He has had friends over to play with this set and they can have a really big battle because there are so many pieces. He is 12
4,Great stuff!,My son really has enjoyed setting up the intricate battle arrangements and he and his uncle talk about the battles in the war.
2,Manufacturing defects !,"Would have made a great Christmas present were it not for the manufacturing defects in one of the landing craft (door hinge incompletely formed) and the farm house (badly misaligned walls when assembled). Given the other positive reviews, I have to think this was just an unfortunate manufacturing mishap. Still, it makes me wonder whether the quality control guy at BMC was sleeping that day ! Really ruined the Christmas present for my son... so I'm unlikely to risk trusting their products in the future."
3,Wrong editorial,"I haven't seen this DVD, but I know that the editorial review printed here refers to another DVD (which I HAVE seen), not this one. Don't buy this expecting to see the material referred to in the editorial review."
5,My Granddaughter loves this item,"We received this very quickly after ordering. It was even nicer than we expected. We put it together for my 8 month old granddaughter on Christmas Eve. She grabbed it, pulled herself up to standing and immediately started walking across the room. She loves the lights and sounds, and it's the perfect height. I'm so happy we purchased this item."
4,Great for baby who already walks,"My daughter and nephew love this toy but they were already walking when they began playing with it. I agree with previous reviews that it is light weight and can be dangerous for babies trying to pull up and lean on something. For toddlers and early walkers though, it is a fantastic option with lots of engaging activities."
5,Loved it,this is a great gift for toddlers especially cause it has the advantage of helping them how to walk on thier own plus while learning numbers
5,keeps em occupied,this is not for a first time walker unless on carpet. Got this when she started pulling up and cruising the couch. due to tile on floors it would get away from her and cause a fall but she quickly learned not to push just sit and play with it.After a month ... she was nonstop all over with this.
4,Happy baby,"Very versatile and entertaining. Our grandson (10 months) played with this constantly for three days over Thanksgiving vacation. I like that there are two speeds for the walking, but wish there was a brake lock feature."
5,Five-star toy for beginning walkers,"I bought this for my niece and she loves it! She is learning how to let go of items and walk on her own, so this is great for her because she has to let go of the handle to play with the items on the front of the toy. The item is colorful and teaches all kinds of stuff from numbers to letters. My niece would push it around like a shopping cart."
5,Great for teaching to walk,"My 11 month old grandson has just started walking unaided 2-6 steps at a time. He loves walking behind it, holding on to the handle, but has not yet learned to make turns or back up. Very colorful, sturdy and entertaining."
4,Great Toy - Broke in 2 months....,My daughter LOVES this toy. Its great for kids over 7months and those learning to walk. My only complaint is that in just 2 months the buttons on the front are stuck and now broken! :( Would still buy this product. Going to see if VTech will replace mine.
3,OK toy,"We were looking for a toy to help our daughter walk, something she could push. The problem with this toy is that on the hardwoods it goes really fast and its hard for our daughter to control the speed and steering. So I found myself walking with her to help her but that is not so much fun for my back! On the carpet it is great. She really likes this toy and laughs whenever she walks while pushing it. She also likes all the activity on the front. I think it helped her with her walking and even though she can walk on her own now she still likes to play with this toy. You can also take off the acitivy board and play with it separately which is nice."
5,great product,"my granddaughter loves this walker..( 9 months ).pushes easily, loves the toys on the front. great product.. would def recommend to others."
3,Well Made,"After researching other push and learn toys, I thought this was the best option since it is a toy that will grow with our daughter who is seven months old. I like the way the toy panel can be removed and used separately from the walker. The main issue I have with it is that it is very loud even on the lowest volume. The music can also be very annoying. V-Tech needs to improve the quality of the music and voices. That being said, I think the toy is well made and will serve the purpose for which we purchased it."
2,Mixed Feelings,"We bought this toy when our daughter was just learning to sit up around 4-5 months. At first this toy was sensory overload for her. She would actually look away. Around six months she began to enjoy playing with the toy and would sit playing with it as long as we let her. This was one of the first things she attempted to pull up on which she found out it is not good for. The toy has ended up on top of her more than once. She hasn't been hurt by it but she does seem frustrated by it. She is not walking yet so I can't comment on that aspect of the toy. But the wheels move very easily even on thick carpet so I think it may move too much for a new walker. At one point we did think the toy had broken because it kept freezing up, as other reviewers mention. This was easily fixed with new batteries. As a wrap up, at times this toy has been great for our daughter and at other times not so much."
1,Poor quality.,"Never had any safety issues, I think parents just need to use better discretion on where to use this. Anything with wheels is going to roll away. My issue was the play panel. It worked for about one month and then the sounds started freezing and getting stuck whenever it was turned on. Can't turn it on anymore at all. Still keep it around for the walking value but that panel is done."
1,disappointed,"After much research online and asking friends who had the Vtech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker, I must say it was one of the more disappointing toys I've bought. I originally did a lot of research because I wanted a learning walker capable of allowing my son to pull himself up and learn to stand and eventually walk. I was looking at this one and a MUCH CHEAPER Fisher Price one. I decided to get this one because many people said the wheels on the Fisher Price model roll too fast. Well so does the Vtech. Plus the sound from the toy is way too loud and obnoxious. I should have bought the Fisher Price. Wish I can return this."
4,entertaining,I got this for my 7 month old. He loves it. It lights up and makes noises. Only one part(the phone) isn't attached to the toy. Easily becomes a carry along toy for my 3 year old too.
4,"A Very Colorful, Fun Toy",My son loves it. And I love that it has 2 volume controls :) It has several lights and sounds that come on with each button you press.
2,Serious design flaw...not educational,"This toy claims to be a learning walker, yet the three shapes with colors are incorrect. The corn is on the red, the apple is on the orange, the pumpkin is on the yellow. This is just idiotic! Also, the volume (as is true of most baby toys) is far too loud and sometimes the phone sound gets stuck and repeats until I turn it off. For all that my eight month old will go and push the buttons and seems interested in it for a few minutes, it just isn't educational. It looks fun, with lots of buttons and things to do, but there are some serious flaws you should consider before purchasing. Frustration free packaging is great!"
4,Very nice!,"My son loves this toy. He can't walk with it yet cause the wheels roll way too fast for him since his not comfortable walking yet. Its really for kids that can comfortably walk on their own, so i wouldnt consider it a walker. Other than that, he plays with it a lot. The fun piece detaches so it goes with us in the car or even to the beach. It definey keeps him ocupied."
3,Where is the phone?,"So I received this in the mail yesterday, and the phone that goes to the toy is nowhere to found. Although my child loves the toy so far, I feel as though he would love it even more with the phone. Yes, I could return it but thats so much of a hassle. Amazon you failed me on this one!"
2,Not very Durable!,My 9 month old loves this toy until it broke. He had nothing to do with how it broke. We only had it for 3 days when it stopped working right. The sounds no longer works. When you turn it on it just makes a funny noise and everything lights up. The toy is pretty much a joke and I dont recommend purchasing this product.
2,Just another junky plastic toy!,"I ordered this after reading many good reviews on the product. However, when I received it I was really disappointed. It's just another junky plastic kids toy. It's not sturdy at all. My 8 month old tries to pull up on it to stand and it topples over on him. It's flimsy and wobbly. I don't recommend it unless you are on a severe budget. Invest in something better. I have since ordered the Haba wagon walker. It's made of wood and seems much more sturdy. In fact I've decided to do away with all these junky plastic made in china toys and start buying less toys, but better quality toys (old school wooden ones). I'm sick of all the crappy plastic. Not only does it look cheap, but it is cheap! Cheaply made. I guess you really do get what you pay for.I gave this toy 2 stars because the removable piece does entertain my son somewhat."
1,"Great toy, but poorly constructed","My 10 month old son loves this toy, but the reason I only gave it one star is this: The portion of the toy that comes off--the part with all the activities and music does not stay securely on the walker. I can't tell you how many times he has tried to pull himself up and fallen backwards because the stupid panel pops off. I can't have the panel on the walker anymore because of this. One other gripe that probably would not bother most people, but...the woman's accent--she says, ""Thanks for callin'."" when the phone is hung up or ""Ring a ling the animals sing"" is obnoxious. It is a thick Long Island accent. I'm sorry to all the Northeastern folks reading this review, but to a Southern Girl the accent is not very melodic and to be honest grates on my last nerve. Sorry!!"
1,WALKERS ARE UNSAFE,PEDIATRICIANS DO NOT RECOMMEND BABY WALKERS!!! I AM SURPRISED TO SEE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE BUY THEM! THEY ARE POTENTIALLY VERY DANGEROUS:[...]
3,Accidents,Overall a great toy. My son loves all the lights and sounds and colors BUT he was using it one day with the slower speed and in his excitement to be standing on his own he started bouncing up and down and the wheels slipped out from under it and he fell flat on his back. He was not a very happy camper
5,Great Toy to Grow With,"My then 8-month old son received this as a Christmas gift. He was in the early stages of standing and this toy wasn't ideal, but it served it's purpose. He loved, and still loves, the ""toy"" part and the ""walker"" part helped him to balance himself more. He fell a few times, but what child doesn't when learning to stand and walk. Now he's 9.5 months and he still loves this item, both ""toy"" and ""walker."" He's standing well but won't take steps when we encourage him. But with this item he tries and you can see him figuring out how to walk and stay balanced while pushing the ""walker.""Every child is different and every parent even more so. I've enjoyed and I'm still enjoying the learning benefits of this toy. Whether or not it's for you and your child is really a decision you have to make. It all depends on where your child is and what your comfortable with ""safety-wise."" As I mentioned above, what child doesn't fall a few times at this stage of life."
4,Plenty of colors and options,Our young granddaughter sit and plays with this but the best thingies she will be able to use it when she is learning to stand as well.
3,great until...,"Less than a year after purchase, it suddenly stopped working. Replaced battery- didn't work. Took it apart to realize that a thin wire had disconnected. Fortunately, we have the equipment to solder it back, but you'd think a kids toy like this would be designed a little more sturdy to handle repeated impact, especially since the front toy is difficult to connect to the push cart."
3,"Not very educational, just loud","I'm not a fan of toys that have a ""loud"" and ""louder"" switch (Seriously? On and off is sufficient.) and this toy is no exception. My 10 month old daughter likes to push it around and shake the phone and that is about it. Why did no one think to attach the phone to the unit? She just carries it around and it keeps getting lost. There are 2 modes you can put it in, one has a book and one has a music note. Neither one really teaches anything. I still have not quite figured out what buttons trigger what noise or song, so I doubt she is getting much from it other than noise and flashing lights. Another annoying thing is that if she doesn't play with it, it continues to make noise as if beckoning her to come back. Just shut off and be done!"
4,"Keeps little hands busy, but pretty darned noisy","My 17-month-old son received this for Christmas last year and he still plays with it every day. It has two volume settings but he now knows how to turn it up, himself (joy...). The phone has no cord or string to keep it attached to the pop-out tray so it sometimes gets misplaced as my son loves to take it around the house. I wouldn't buy this thing for an educational purpose, but its entertainment value is second to none. My boy was never one to walk with it, but he will push it around when he wants it somewhere else. Make sure to turn it off when you're done playing, as the slightest jostle could make it start to play music, if you leave it on. Battery life is pretty good; we've only had to change them once in the past year, and he uses it all the time."
2,"Fabulous for about two weeks, then died","My babygirls loved it, but after about two weeks of not constant play, it started freezing, the rooster is the only thing that makes a sound and it's over and over and over....now it turns on, the sun lights up, and it makes the effort to make a sound, then it stops...frozen. I tried changing the batteries, thinking that would be it, but no. I am SO disappointed because they really loved it. I'm pretty upset because these toys are supposed to be durable enough to put up with baby use, which can sometimes be a little rough with the button pressing, but literally two weeks into use and it's just another old toy."
3,Good Concept but not for a first time walker.,"Some friends had recommended that we purchase a walker for our 11 month old.As others have stated, the wheels move too fast on wood and tile. Our nanny had put tape on the back wheels but that only lasts so long.Now after 3 months the electronics have stopped working and it's past the amazon return window.Knowing what I know now, I would not repurchase."
2,looks cooler than it actually is...,"I got this as a walker for my infant. Didn't realize that it would be so slippery on hard wood floor, so it's actually more of a danger to my child. She's 10 months and I wanted her to practice walking. But then when I read the directions, you're not suppose to use it as an actual walker until age 1 anyways. Even then, I'm not sure if it would be safe because if they grab it to use to stand up or anything, it's very light and would flip and can make the baby fall. But anyways, Up until the age of 1, you're suppose to just play with all the buttons on the front. But my baby doesn't play with the buttons although she likes the detachable phone. That's pretty much the only thing she play with. Maybe it's because I have so many other toys that she can press and make sounds with that she's not interested in this one. Or maybe 10 months is still too young. But so far, my baby's not really interested. :("
4,Colorful and interactive,I love how colorful this walker is. I got this for our 1 year old son. The variety of activities are great. Even our 3 year old son likes to play with it. Kids always love phones too. It's great you can take the activities off and use it on the floor. It does help my son to walk around.
2,Stop Working After 5mos of Use,"I purchased this for my 5mos Old Son, because I wanted a toy that would be eye level when sitting and also could use when older. He loves it great Toy.Great For Sitting LayingGreat for when he starting walking 8MosHe is now 9mos still want's to play with it but it has stopped working."
3,VTech Walker is just Okay this time,"I was hoping this walker would be really sturdy for my nephew learning to walk. My boys had a VTech about 13 years ago that we loved. I was not real happy with the quality, a little too light weight."
5,Awesome!,"We have purchased two of these after one was given to a friend (we didn't think we'd have more kids!) and both times our babies have been completely mesmerized. They love the songs, all f the activities and it is very durable. I also really like that the front plate is detachable so you can take it on a car ride. Assembly (and dis-assembly) are very easy so if you want to take it apart and pack it in your luggage to go on a trip, you can-- we've done it! The only down side is that the phone isn't really attached and it is super easy to lose. I wish it was on a cord like the shapes at the top."
5,Great Value for money,Great value for money with lots of good interesting colourful activities. Will also last through the growing months into early years.
3,"Great toy, doesn't last","I love this walker. My neighbor had it and my daughter was obsessed, so I had to order it. Within a month, it got stuck on one note and did not shut off. I sent it back and got another one. This one lasted two months before it did the same thing. Too bad, it is really entertaining for the little ones."
4,"Baby loves it, but the panel comes off too easily and wheels don't lock","She loves. Has had a great time pushing buttons and pushing it around. She's fully walking on her own now, but still likes pushing it around every once and a while.Two cons: the panel on the front is detachable...which is nice, but it comes off too easily. Sometimes she's able to pull it off on her own. The phone receiver comes off too easily. She tried to pull up by grabbing the phone and fell back down. It startled her. I took the phone off and never put it back on. Niether of these is a big deal, but wish they were a little more stable.Lastly, would have been nice if they gave me the ability to lock the wheels. When baby is sitting to play with it, it rolls away since the wheels don't lock. To remedy this, you have to have baby play with it up against something like the wall to keep it from rolling away from her."
5,I loved it,"I bought it for my great granddaughter, she was just getting ready to take her first steps. That was what was needed to help her."
1,stopped working very quickly,Stoped working after a few weeks. It looked great but turned out to be a no as good as expected.
5,Cute toy with lots of activities,I bought this for my granddaughters first birthday. She is still learning to walk and loves to push it around. Cute toy for nice price
2,not work properly,Product was damaged and had to be returned. Our baby did seem to enjoy the walker although the various components didn't work even though we changed the batteries three times.
5,One week in and my nephew can't put it down!,"I bought this gift as an early christmas present for my 7 month old nephew. He is just learning to sit, and I would not recommend this toy for any child younger than him as it would be very hard to play with if he couldn't sit up by himself. The second he saw it, his eyes lit up. He grabs at everything and listens intently to every sound that comes out of it and you truly can see the gears turning in his head. He is trying to figure out, ""OK if I do this, then it's going to cause that."" I think this is an absolutely great toy for the price. Its huge and seems pretty durable thus far. We have set up the walker for him and put it against the wall so that it doesn't move and he can play.As for the battery issue, it does say right on the box that the batteries included are for demo purposes only and that they will need replacing. I don't envision a problem when we add the ""real"" batteries as the demo ones haven't even died yet!HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TOY!"
5,One year old loves it,Great 1st birthday present...my son loves it. It's really sturdy but on tiles the wheels do go pretty fast. Alot for baby to see and do.
3,"Fun for awhile, but it doesn't stay together.","This toy is so-so. Our daughter used it as a walked while learning to walk, but other than that, hasn't been much interested in it as a toy to play with. The panel on the front is constantly falling off and the telephone isn't attached to it at all, which means that I""m always finding it in random locations. I don't think that it's been with the toy for months now. Overall, a so-so product. Kinda obnoxious songs and not very educational."
2,Frozen after a month,Only had this walker for a month and it started to get stuck on the rooster crowing. Whenever it is turned to high volume it will freeze. When you turn it down to low volume it will reset and work only to suddenly freeze up again.
4,"For 9 month old, great musical toy when used without wheels","I bought this for my 9 month old niece because she loves to pull herself up to a standing position any time she can grab onto something for support. However, when I gave her this walker to try to ""walk"" and take steps forward, the walker moved way too quickly and she would have fallen right on her face if I hadn't grabbed the walker and stopped it. There is no way to make the wheels turn slower, and no way to ""lock"" the wheels so that the toy can stand stationary. So, I took the musical panel off the wheels and my niece LOVES playing with it. The best thing about the musical panel for my niece is that she doesn't have to have precise motor skills in order to make the toy ""talk"" - it plays music and says words with a very light, uncoordinated touch, which is perfect for a baby. I like this product and I look forward to trying it again as a walker once my niece is closer to a year old."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS TOY, IT IS NOT SAFE!","I am starting to think many of the amazon reviews are fake. This STUPID toy is not safe! It is too lightweight which causes it to tip over when baby pulls herself up (she is 9 months old). The wheels have no traction whatsoever, which makes the toy slide and baby fall on her face. Repetitive sounds will drive anyone crazy! Must of all, it is not safe! Bad bad design! NOT designed for baby learning to walk! I wish I could return it, but the packaging comes with so many tapes and wires that you have to tear the box in pieces to take the toy out and try it, probabily to make sure nobody returns it! One of the worst baby products I ever bought!"
3,Not an IDEAL walker,"The only part that my son enjoyed about this ""walker"" is the removable toy. Otherwise, it should only be intended for children that can walk on their own. It has no resistance on the wheels, therefore it cannot withhold a walking learner or stander. I found it very unsecure and dangerous for beginning walkers."
2,doenent have breaks!!!!!,I would give this sit to stand walker 5 stars IF it had breaks!!!! I my children like the toy overall but how is it a walker with no breaks!?
5,Perfect toy for a toddler,"My one year old son loves this toy. It is his favourite toy. He loves to pretend talking on the phone, loves the music and the amazing thing is he identifies the 5 keystrokes and enjoys a lot."
2,Shoddy,"My 9-month-old loves this toy. So why did I give it two stars? First, it is not the safest. He's fallen with it quite a few times because it slides more than it rolls. Second, it is not well-made. It keeps shorting out, freezing, and making crazy noises. It will probably completely break here in a bit, based on what I've read in some other reviews. It's a shame, because it's one of my son's favorite toys right now."
5,Amazing Product!,"Am so happy with this product, my baby is 8 months, and is nearly walking because of the encouragement this product has given him. I was going to buy a walker that rolls around before I bought this product, but when I heard that they were unsafe, I opted for this product instead. The lights and sounds are good, and not too repetitive, however, the little door function broke after two days of use. An amazing, affordable buy."
4,"New Version does not have Corn, Apple and Pumpkin!","Haven't used this as a walker yet but so far it's great for tummy time. The music and lights keep my little one interested, but most of all the gears are what captivates him when I want him to finish up those last few seconds of tummy time. Educationally, it's great with the numbers, colors and shapes. The music is loud and obnoxious to adults but that's what gets the attention of babies and it works! Make sure to turn it OFF, otherwise it has a mind of it's own. The one I got must be the newest version because it does not have the corn, pumpkin and apple that everyone is complaining about. My version has the numbers 1, 2 and 3 instead - thank goodness! Overall, I think it is a good toy and a great value! They sell pianos alone for $20 and this toy gives you a lot for 28 bucks! Get it at Buy Buy Baby and use the 20% off coupon."
2,Like a broken record,"I got this for my son for Christmas. It is now February, and when on the loud setting, it sticks like a broken record-- 5 seconds of intro song, rooster crow, repeat. It's awful."
5,V tech stand and learning walking toy,My 10 month old just loved this toy. It help him to learn how to walk. He loves the music and push the bottons on it. Glad I got it for him.
5,Wonderful Toy,"This toy is amazing for any child beginning to walk. I first saw this toy in person and saw how engaged the child was with it and how well it worked. When I was looking for a gift for another child, I knew I wanted to see if I could get it. I was surprised by how inexpensive it was. After seeing it in person, I thought it would cost much more. You're really getting a good value for your money with this one!"
3,ok,"This toy is much less expensive than it was at babies r us which is why I bought it on Amazon, the only problem is that the phone is not connected with a cord so I can see it getting lost easily. I am not sure if I am going to keep it or return it."
1,Overstimulating,"My son likes this toy but I don't think it has any educational value what so ever. The songs overlap so you can't make out a single word or focus on one thing and the face plate falls off easily. The walker is a good concept but the wheels are too fast. We put tape on them to create resistance so he doesn't fall on his face, but the risk is still there."
2,Very disappointed,"Although this toy does have all the bells and whistles it advertises, I think it is boring. The worst is that even when the child chooses another toy to play with this noisy thing starts up with the music as if calling for the child to come back and play with it. I find that annoying."
4,A Great Toy,This is a great toy. I bought it for my 9mos old and he has great fun with this. I love that the activity part comes off and can travel with baby. The music is cute and it's one of the few toys he goes back to again and again. Would recommend. Great price too.
2,Not what I expected!,"This toy has alot of activities, but is not a very good walker. It would keep my son occupied, but when he would stand up to push it, he would lean over and just play with the buttons instead of pushing it.If he did start pushing it, it is so light weight, it would just scoot ahead so fast. I was scared he was going to fall on his face. They should make the wheels alittle more tighter so it is easier for the child to control."
3,Entertaining,This toy keeps my baby entertain for a few is very colorful lots of songs. But it does tip over. My baby just turned one he is trying to stand but he is not steady so he falls.
5,Autumn's birthday present from Meme.,"I bought the Vtech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker for my Grand-daughter's first birthday. She loves to play with the many activities as well as use the walker. I like the different types of activities which each have a specific learning feature for growing and developing little brains. Your child is learning, playing, and having fun all at the same time. This is the second time one of our babies has had this Vtech toy. Our family highly recommends this toy."
4,Good Buy,"My son's got this toy at 10-month. He likes to play with the phone and pull on the strings. I hope when he grows a little older that he'll start using the other options included and learn to speak the numbers and name the animals, as well as learn how to walk."
2,Three Engineering Flaws,"This toy is a cute concept, however, there are three major engineering/design flaws. 1) The phone does not attach to the toy panel with any type of cord. This means that we are constantly losing the phone and it is never attached to the panel. 2) The panel easily falls off of the walker and does so all the time. It should be attached more securely. 3)The back ""legs"" look as though they fold down so the toy can be stored or transported, but they do not. If these three issues were fixed, this toy would be perfect. My son enjoys it, but it is a bit of a hassle to deal with these issues."
2,Not for Pre-Walkers,I bought this toy based on the reviews about how great it was for pre-walkers and how the wheels didnt move as quickly as other walkers. I didn't find this to be the case. It was way to fast for my 10 month old who is not quite walking on his own. We even tried to rig it up to slow the wheels down and it was so light even without the wheels moving it was just sliding across our laminate flooring. The only place he was able to use it without me holding onto it was out in the grass. The music and lights on it are completely overwhelming for a baby. Each button plays a little song or music and hitting another button just interrupts that and starts a new song. And we wonder why so many kids have problems focusing and paying attention?! I ended up forking out the money for a wooden style one with an adjustable brake and a little seat and he loves that one!
1,Poor quality,The play panel worked for the first ten minutes and now freezes every time we turn it on. It's also not very educational as it does not repeat the vocals when the buttons are pressed. Instead either it will make a random comment or music will play. And if it is not touched within a few seconds it will start playing music. There's no chance for kids to learn cause and effect. The only part my daughter likes is to take the phone off the hook.
3,Just Another TOY.,"I was so excited to get this ""walker"" for my 1 year old son. He has yet to actually use it. Every time he attempts to walk with it it rolls forward too fast and the activity board doesn't hold his attention for long. After doing a little research online I found out that even though it is advertised as a ""walker"" they admit it is actually just a toy, not an actual walker. (According to another mother that bought it and wrote a letter to the company.) I'm still waiting to see if my son changes his mind about it but so far a dud."
4,Good Product Great Value,"My 9 month old son loves this toy, he enjoys walking with it and playing with the activities. The activity center from the front can be taken off and the child can play with it separately. I wanted to get him an activity table and a walker, but this model kinda combines both, so I feel that it's a great value and saves on space. One negative is that at first my baby boy could not get up using the toy, he would fall back right back down with it, plus he could barely control it while working. In a few days, however, he adjusted and learned how to use it better. You may want to watch your child extra close and make sure that he does not fall on a hard surface trying to walk with the toy especially in the beginning. Overall great toy, great value."
5,We love it!,"We just purchased this for our daughter and she loves it! There are so many fun things to play with on here, but her favorites are the piano keys and the phone! She loves using this to pull up on and we know she will be walking soon! We all love this toy!"
5,WALKING TALL,"I BROUGHT THIS FOR MY 13MONTH OLD GREAT GRANDDAUGTHER, P.T TOLD MY GRANDDAUGTHER THAT SHE NEEDED SOMETHING TO HELP HER WALK, SO THEY SAID THIS WAS STRONG AND GREAT FOR HER TO HOLD ONTO AND NOT FALL OVER, WELL SHE AHS USED IT EVERYDAY SENTS I BROGUHT TI FOR HER AND SHE IS NOW WALKING WITH OUT THE VTECH-SIT-TO-STAND, IM SO HAPPY WITH WHAT THIS HAS DONE FOR HER."
4,Wheels are too fast.,"Overall the toy walker is very educational, but the wheels roll too fast for first time walkers. Even when I put the wheels on the 1 gauge, for them to move slower, the wheels move too fast for my son to walk. He really loves to play with the buttons and he stand with it sometimes, but I have to help him walk with it. Overall it get 4 stars."
5,Just LOVE IT!,My son and I love this walker sooooo much! my mother said this is the best toy that i hv ever bought.My son is now 11 months old and he used this before he can actually stand and walk.Basically this is a great music player- long and fun and a good helper to support my son to walk.My lo walk around the house with this now. SO fun!
4,Great Learning Toy,"This walker is the perfect height for new walkers. The wheels can adjust to two speeds and the detachable face feature is excellent. Just make to sure to turn toy ""off"" in the night as it is easily activated. My daughter and her visiting toddler cousins love it! So glad I bought it. Very eductaional and interactive, most of all very well proced!"
2,walker,"this item is fun only because it has wheels for my son to push it around. the front part of the item comes off easy and im very disappointed with my order, i wish there were reviews explaining the problems im having and i wouldnt have bought it"
4,Great,"My son loves to push this around. We have to help him though because it goes kind of fast. We live in an apartment so we also have to help him turn and maneuver around the areas he can go, which is to be expected. I think the wheels could be a bit tighter in order to help him get used to it and go a bit slower. He was 8 months when we bought it. He is getting better at it and will probably love it even more when he gets a little older. He loves to take the phone off and shake it!"
5,Very entertaining,"Gave this to my 8 month old grandson at Chirstmas. As expected he was more interested in the bows and paper - until this was opened and the batteries (provided) were put in. He loved it, immediately started playing with it. After a short while his dad put it away so more presents could be opened - my grandson showed his displeasure and it was brought back out. He isn't walking yet so is just using the activity center part. We liked that it made many different sounds depending on how it was used. Think this will hold his attention for a long time. May have to buy another one to keep at our house!"
5,Perfect Gift and Toy!,"Purchased for my neighbor who is not walking yet! This toy is great because it comes apart and you can take it with you, lay it on the floor or hook it to the walker anf he can practice walking then when he wants a break he can play until he is ready to try again."
2,Not safe,"I had to take this away from my son because it would tip over backwards. It was otherwise really nice and he loved the activities and songs on it, but I would strongly urge you not to buy it. After the second time my son tried to pull himself up with it to walk around and ended up smacking his head on the ground because it tipped right over on top of him, I decided it had been a waste of money."
2,Short-circuiting after 3-months,"One day recently, at 11pm, long after we put out 10 month-old to bed in his crib, we hear ""The sun is shining..."" coming from his playroom. Then 11pm, 12am, 1am... you get the idea. We have had the Vtech Sit-to-Stand Learning Walker for since Christmas. His interest is minimal for this toy. I would like to say it's educational but I'm in reality on the fence about that statement. It hardly keeps his attention, and the voice is hard to understand - so how can he really learn? All he cares to do is eat the phone and pull the shapes of the mounts. I thought it was a good toy from the description and design so I requested it as a Christmas present. I can say now after 3-months of use, I don't like it much and wish I had asked for something else."
5,Great learning tool,"Purchased it for my grandson,s first birthday. Less then a week later he was walking all by himself.The toy gave him the confidence he needed.He loves the music also."
4,Really fun!,"This is a gr8 toy my daughter really loves it. Its durable, musical, and has all these different features. The price is decent. The only issue I have with this is the fact that it has no brakes. When my daughter tries to walk it runs away from her.."
3,Too Much Going On!,"There is too much going on for our daughter to learn anything, and the constant noise drives us crazy! You hit one button and first it will say ""square"", then perhaps a color, then it has music. You can't just get it to repeat ""square."" When not touched for a few seconds, it then repeats its welcome song. I wanted this toy because it had lots of different sounds, but I didn't realize how they would play out in reality. My daughter (10 months) likes one of the buttons, but ignores the others."
2,"I though it would last more than three weeks,","It looked Very Good, My Daughter loved it at first sight, she started to play with it, but after less than 3 weeks, its started to reset every 2 seconds, and then started to freeze, After less more than a month it stopped working at all, all the music and the electric parts became useless, but she still walks with it."
1,love this toy...until it quit working!,"Old Review: Love this toy! I like that it has so many things to keep my baby entertained. I love that it can be used without the walker part for a baby that isn't ready to walk yet.UPDATE 5/22/12: I DO NOT love this toy! It quit working after only two months of use from my baby. I called Vtech and they said that they would ship out a new replacement. The only catch, is that I have to pay shipping to mail mine back and have them ship another!!! That is more than the product is worth!!!! REALLY!!??? I had a defective Fisher Price toy last year and they paid all shipping costs to replace it, they were great. I will NEVER buy a Vtech toy again!!!"
5,Vtech Walker Review,This is a great product! It has lots of neat educational toys on the front and it has helped my son start to get ready to take his first real steps.
3,"Took a while, but baby plays with it","My mom bought this for my daughter's 1st Birthday. I thought it was probably too late for her to enjoy the toy, since she's already started walking. Her favorite part of the toy is the little purple phone. She likes to carry it around the house and pretends she's talking on it. She wasn't all that interested in pushing it around until recently (14 months). Now, she's proficient enough to move it around wherever she wants it to go and she runs with it. She is not that interested in the buttons and activities on the front of it, but she does like the little songs that play. She plays with this every day in short spurts. The only thing I don't understand is why the different colored/shaped button on the top of the thing, don't match the colors of the foods on the buttons. For instance, the picture of corn is on the orange button, the pumpkin is on the red button and the apple is on the yellow button. Doesn't make sense."
4,exactly what baby needs,"This is a great product, fun tunes and each key has many selections. Keeps my My 7 month old son standing and playing with it for 20 minutes at a time."
4,Love it !,"Bought this for my baby girl when she was about 7 months, she started walking with it right away and had a blast. It was so much fun seeing my girl walking around, it also has plenty of toys ,which she still plays with today,even though she can walk by herself now. Great choice!"
5,Works as it should,"The only bad thing about this walker is that the phone isn't connected by a cord at all, while the removable shapes are. Super easy to put together, took all of 2 minutes. The ""learning"" part is removable so it's almost a two in one toy."
2,Never Worked,"My son got this as a gift for his first Christmas and the toy never worked, despite trying new batteries. It sat in our garage for over a year, but since we moved my now 2 year old son has been enjoying playing with it. None of its best features were ever usable since it came broken and never turned on, but he does enjoy running around pushing it."
2,"Fun, but dangerous","I have twin daughters who are 9 months old. I purchased this 4-6 weeks ago as they were just starting to walk with assistance. I bought it based on the reviews, but have mixed feelings about it. My daughters LOVE the toy that comes off the front and still use it every day after having it for over a month. However, the walker is dangerous. There is no resistance and my daughters were always fall as it goes too quickly for a pre-walker. Even on carpet, it's just too fast and my daughters can't handle it. We have tried helping them, but it's difficult bending over that far for that long to help the babies slow down and use the toy. I wish there was some resistance on the wheels so it wouldn't be so dangerous for the babies to use. We kept the front toy off and let the babies play with it, but after several instances of the girls getting hurt while trying to use this toy, I took it apart and packed it away."
3,Not a good walking toy!!!!!,My son loves this toy it makes lots of noise and lights up and it is very durable but its not walker material when hes holding on to the toy all he wants to do is press the buttons and not walk with it I wouldnt reccomend this toy to anyone who is trying to get there child to walk its too distracting.
4,Great Toy,My nine month old loves this toy...hasn't really used it to help walk yet but she stands and plays all the time with it!Good BUY
5,Barnyard Blast,"My daughter loves this toy. Her favorite part is the phone, which doubles as a rattle. I love that it disconnects from the walker so that she can play with it on the ground. She picks it up and beats it on the ground and it doesn't show the slightest bit of wear-and-tear. The 2 different modes, song and words, give me a much needed break from the ""Barnyard Sing-along"" and keep her thinking it's a new toy. I would definitely recommend this toy."
3,Grandkids,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my grandchildren , the only thing their parents did not like was the fact that it had no brakes on it and it would go too fast for a beginning walker"
4,New Favorite Toy!,"This is my 6 month old daughters new favorite toy! She loves sitting there and moving all the parts and being able to make it sing and light up all by herself. She is not walking yet of course, but when she starts there is a way to adjust how ""loose"" the back wheels are. Basically you can control how fast it rolls. This is a great feature so that you dont have to worry about it slipping away from your little one and them falling. The only negative thing I have to say is that my daughter has pulled it over on top of herself a few times. I wish I could figure out how to anchor it down so she didn't do this. But it's really not a big deal. Definitely a great toy and worth the $!!!"
5,Great toy!!!!,My niece LOVED this toy. She was so excited to play with it. She didn't play with any other toy after she opened it.
5,great product,bought these because out apartment is small they really help my son to walk and now that he is walking he still plays with it
5,Divertido,A mi bebe de 9 meses le encanta. Muy divertido y educativo ademas que le ayuda a dar sus primeros pasos.
5,This is great,"Class Warfare is Chomsky at his finest. Barsamian asks pointed questions about classic issues such as race, the economy, U.S. foreign policy, etc. A class act"
2,Slow pitch softball,"The interview is a series of soft ball questions without any critical exchange. It allows the reader get a good amount of Chomsky's own propaganda in short order, but many of his sweeping statements are never challenged. If you'd like to get some opposing views on liberty and economics, Hayek has much more interesting things to say."
2,"Chomsky at his idealistic, left wing moralizing worst.","This book features several interviews with Chomsky and David Barsamian about current events in which Chomsky gives no new insight but rehashes his standard material which he has been repeating in his countless books since the 70's. It is almost sicking how such an intellectual like Chomsky is still captivated in some adolecent left wing ideologies about how revolution is liberating, yada yada yada, basicly he has nothing new to say."
3,"Love GG, but audio is terrible on this one...","I don't have the greatest stereo in my car to begin with, but I can't listen to this album at all in my car. The audio is terrible. For GG fans and collectors that would like to just sit down and listen to it, go ahead and buy it. There's some really cool stuff on this one... especially on the live audio and some freestyle stuff he does at the end.To sum it up: Collectors go ahead and buy it. Just don't plan on jamming to it because the audio sucks."
3,Great Songs / Nearly Unbearable Quality,"Okay, this recording has some of the greatest songs GG Allin has EVER recorded. The trouble is, the music sounds like its been put through a meat grinder. No real GG Allin fan expects good sound quality ripping through the speakers along with GG's toothless growl, but its nice when you can actually HEAR the music. It's just intolerable. Or maybe I just got spoiled listening to Hated in the Nation 700 times in a row first.By the way, Hated in the Nation is probably the best GG Album you can get, next to... Drunks and Junkies, followed closely by Brutality and Bloodshed for all. Hated in the Nation, FFD and J, and B and B for all are MUST HAVE'S for ANY GG fan, or anyone who can laugh at the sick, depraved, disgusting and violent.Also recommended to parents of Goth children. At least you're kids haven't found GG yet!!!"
1,Product Details required,Can you please publish the topics you have covered?Who is the Actor?What is the duration of this DVD?For what grade its applicable?Since the price is $145 we want to know what we are buying? Make Sense!!!!
1,Misled in purchase,I bought this product thinking it was the movie starring Valentino. Instead I see it is in a book form which is not mentioned in the advertisement. I unfortunately destroyed the order statement along with the box. I am greatly upset with this. I have been a good customer of Amazon. com for a period of time. I would appreciate a refund or credit for ths item.
4,Embrace the love,"I listened to Najee chat with Dave Koz (saxophonist/radio host) about his latest project Embrace on 94.7 (radio) last month. He talked about the relevance to the album's title-Embrace (American's embraced each other after healing post September 2001). Embrace is Najee's first musical project on Ncoded. He also mentioned that he had been through a few music labels. In addition, he mentioned that he had worked with Prince on two of his (Prince's) albums.I really appreciated Najee's collaboration with Roy Ayers (his jazz influence) on Vibin' with Ayers. My favorite tunes? Mali's Bounce, Eye 2 Eye, On My Way and Sunshine Sometimes Rain -who I thought featured songstress Chaka Khan when I first experienced the song. However, the featured vocalist is Robyn Springer. I liked the up-tempo tunes more. I wish there were more of them--like collaborations he has performed with other musicians. I would love to hear Najee shift gears and do more up-tempo tunes."
4,Embrace Falls Short,"Najee is one of the most talented jazz musicians I know of and remains my top favorite. I remember falling in love with ""Najee's Theme"" back in college. His style and bouncy rhythms have kept me mesmerized for many years. His latest project, Embrace, falls short of the Najee projects that he has put together in the past. I do not think his choice of featured vocal artists punctuate the awesome jazz sound that he is capable of producing, or has produced in the past. This CD sounds more like a sophomore CD rather than the masterful art he knows he can produce. I wish he had included more featured vocal artists in this CD. Still the more I listen to the CD the more I like it. It IS CERTAINLY WORTH PURCHASING!!!"
5,Superior product,"The shipping was prompt and the belt I purchased was in new condition. This company gives you a personal touch with each order. I have owned numerous other weightlifting products/aids, but have now found the product line I'm sticking with for good. Thanks to the crew at Schiek for producing these fine products. To anyone who is serious about weightlifting, I strongly recommend you try a Schiek product. You won't be disappointed."
2,Screwdriver set,"As described, I thought this would provide the forked tip really necessary to remove the spring bar pin. NOT. This set contained 3 flat head and 1 phillips head screw driver tip. They were small, but not what I thought was advertised.However, my husband is very pleased with the screwdriver set. We had another small set - but the heads are chipped, so he was happy to have a new set. I would change the rating to 3-stars - but can't figure out how to do that."
4,New Standard Bearers,"On this album Krisiun improves on some of their riffing creativity and also improves on the production from their last album. I consider ""Ageless, Venemous"" to be a masterpiece, and I don't think this album tops it or equals it, however it is strong and reaffirms Krisiun as the new standard in death metal. They are paralyzing and have a unique approach to writing riffs; their songs envelope you in a psychotic whirlwind.I give only 4 stars though because the albums seems short, there is too much filler, and the song ""Murderer"" seems to me a complete re-hash of the song ""Ageless Venemous""...come on guys, you don't have to repeat ideas so blatantly. Also the lyrics are pretty unoriginal.I am slightly disappointed that they didn't improve upon what they have accomplished thus far, but I still think this band is one of the best in death metal of the last few years. I am just wondering who will step up next, because they don't seem to be progressing that much any more."
3,Great sounding radio not a lot of features,"I bought this radio as an upgrade over the old clock radio I've been using for many years. The sound is a huge improvement. It is just as good as the bose clock radio on my wifes side of the bed. Although the absence of a cd player is a negative, this radio does exactly what is advertised. This is a great radio for the nightstand or the kitchen counter."
3,Bass-ic Instinct: Not A Plus,"Really pulls in the stations, but too much bass produces a boom-y sound. This is especially true on talk radio stations where deeper male voices sound like they're coming out of a barrel. I haven't found a way to adjust it, so for $150, I'm rather disappointed."
3,Boston Acoustics Receptor Clock Radio,"The sound is pretty good, and reception is good. If you are only looking for a clock radio, it's kind of pricy for what you get. I thought I was buying the HD version, but got taken in. This is NOT an HD radio. Other drawbacks - the clock stays very bright for a bedside clock radio - no need for a night light, and the case stays warm to the touch whether the radio is on or not. Also, the associated reseller from whom I bought the radio, Electronics Expo, enclosed a paper saying I was getting free music downloads as a bonus with the purchase, but did not include the card or numbers I would need to retrieve the bonus. And when I tried calling (multiple times), the phone was either busy or I got a recording saying they were closed, all the while stating the hours they were open, and my call was within the supposedly open hours. SO, I tried emailing, and never got any response. So, it's a good though expensive radio from a sketchy source."
3,They added an aux in jack ... but,"I think pretty much everything has been said already about the sound quality and other functions.I just picked one of these radios up from circuit city and thought I'd post about a couple of changes that have been made.11. They added an aux in jack (headphone style) that you can use to hook up your ipod, cd-player, etc. So that takes care of one of the most common complaints from other reviews.BUT2. They removed the battery backup of presets and alarm times. What on earth were they thinking? That's an essential feature for an alarm clock. I may even return it because of this. The sound and ease of use are everything I've been looking for, but I can't risk being late because the power blinks off during the night. Sheesh."
2,Did not help AM reception in my area,"I was enthusiastic to get this product because of all the good reviews,however, it did not help receive AM stations in my area (Silicon Valley). Good sound for FM stations."
2,Problem with Volume Control,I bought this radio a couple of years ago and it worked fine for those two years until the volume control function failed.When turning the knob you would get loud static at the low to mid end of the VC range and then it would come on at the 3/4 volume rotation which is much louder than needed most of the time.I have a number of Boston Acoustic speaker sets and have been very happy with them. This radio was a disappointment in terms of quality. Instead of paying to get it repaired I bought the Tivoli Clock radio.On the bright side this radio has dropped considerably in price since I first bought it.
2,Bait & Switch,"I went online to Amazaon, a site I trusted, to locate an HD RADIO for my desk at work.This was listed as an HD radio; only after I received it, opened it, and plugged it in did I discover it is NOT an HD radio. Both the 3rd party vendor and Amazon claim I have no right to a refund. The FCC calls this fraud, and my case is added to a couple of hundred across that nation."
2,Less than thrilled,"I bought this radio because of the promise of great reception, sound and simple interface. After trying it for 2 weeks, I sent it back. The reception was not better than any other radio -- in fact, it's worse than the 30 year old clock radio I'm replacing. The antenna connector couldn't have been designed more awkardly, making it difficult to connect different antennas (to improve its poor reception). The FM antenna provided is minimal and cheap. Also, I didn't like the button interface. To use the preset channels, for example, you have to DIAL from 1 to 10...can't hop from preset 1 to preset 8, have to scroll thru all. Snooze button was hard to use, had to press a certain way, very hard, not user friendly. Clock numbers were smaller than average clocks, so harder to see if you wear glasses during day. Sound was good on stations I could get...but wasn't vastly better than any other radio. All in all, a huge disappointment."
1,Failed Delivery,UPS delivered the product where dogs could destroy it. Filed a claim 6 weeks ago. Never heard a word from the seller or UPS since. Buying the replacement at a local store.
5,Great Radio,"Although this radio seemed a bit expensive for a bedside clock radio, I'm glad I bought it. It has very good sound for its size and good selectivity. It locks onto my favorite (but weak) classical music station and doesn't have interference from stronger stations next to it on the dial."
3,Get Free or Die Tryin' Falls Short,"After dead prez's brilliant groundbreaking first album Let's Get Free, the Uhuru duo gave themselves an extremely high standard to live up to, and their latest mixtape unfortunately falls short of those standards. While there are a few dope cuts on here, such as ""F&*k the Law"" and ""O.G (Original Garvey)"", the album has a very inconsistent feel to it. The production is lackluster in places, and stic.man and M1 haven't progressed much lyrically from their second mixtape. While I have nothing but love for dead prez and the ideals they promote, this album lacks creativity and doesn't do much to distinguish itself either musically or lyrically. Be sure to pick up Let's Get Free and Turn off the Radio, as for this album, if you're a hardcore dead prez fan cope it, if not while till their next LP, Red Black and Green drops.PeaceGlen"
4,Great but short,"Dead Prez's album represents everything hip-hop needs to be.They talk about real issues that plague blacks,hispanics and all other minorities must go through every day in many of their lifes.My only problem is that this album seems too short. It is less than 35 minutes I beleive.Besides this it is a great album."
5,A Glass Window into What Happens in American Animal Shelters,"I served as the executive director of an animal shelter for seven years. Frequently the board of directors, the public, elected officials and the donors wanted a spin put on what happened at the shelter. They wanted stories with happy endings. Finally someone has had the courage to tell the entire truth. Some endings are happy, but many take place in the euthanasia room. Marilee Geyer and Diane Leigh have written an absolutely accurate book about why animals come into shelters and about what happens to then there. Their analysis of the attitudes and behaviors which result in pet overpopulation is brilliant. Every American must read this book about our relationship with our ""best friends."" We must know the entire truth if we are to change it."
4,Hammond Historical World Atlas,Just as described and a very reasonable price. Better than going to the campus bookstore!
2,"yes, it doesn't sick on !!",I bought it beside all the reviews that it said the same thing I am about to write.. it doesn't sick on enough. I follow precisely the instructions and I got bad results.save your money. don't buy it.
1,Not for chipmunks,My 9 month old managed to start peeling up one corner within the first 24 hours. Probably would have worked better on a flat rather than rounded rail
4,Great but....,"The Gummi rail fit and stayed attached to my long rail. The downer was that only 1 gummi rail cover came in the box. When I tried to cut it to fit both my front and 1 side rail, the cover wouldn't stay attached to the smaller side rail.My suggestion is DON'T cut it and it will work just fine."
5,LOVE IT!!,"This is definately a great product. I purchased this for my grandaughter and I havent had any problems with it at all!! My friend put it on for me and even forgot to wipe the crib rails down with alcohol. By the way, I was SO mad at him for that!! My grandaughter is teething so this helps her so much. WHAT A GREAT PRODUCT!!!"
3,Only use this on a THIN rail - but it's still a bit too short for our crib,"So far so good on the thin rail of our crib. I had to attach cloth diaper covers to the end of each rail so that my daughter doesn't peel it off with her teeth. We tried this thin one on our side rails but they are too wide and I've ordered the extra wide gummi crib rail cover. It does work if the crib rail is the right size, the challenge is keeping the baby from peeling it up on the edges...At least we have extra cloth diaper covers that we've snapped overtop of the ends. So until she also figures out how to remove those it works just fine."
3,Nice wide cover - Glue does not hold,This product gives very good coverage but fails to stay attached. The ends started to curl in about a month and now my son has managed to chew the curled up end and pull it of the rail. It is very difficult to attach to side rails of the crib despite following instructions on how to cut and shape it.
1,Waste of $$!,"Ok, so our 7-month old baby girl recently started standing up chewing on her crib rail, so we shopped around & chose this one...Big mistake! It would otherwise be a great product if the adhesive would only stick! We have a white Graco Lauren crib, and it fit fine - just didn't stay put (not even overnight)! At least Amazon is awesome w/returns (we had even thrown away the packaging)- they emailed me a return label & I'm shipping it back! Gonna try a different crib rail protector - one without adhesive this time. And since she was able to chew under this one, the crib rail paint is all chipped, so I have to cover it up now, anyway! :( Fingers crossed that I find a nice one next time that actually stays in place & works!"
3,Better prevention than cure,"I bought this for my son's crib, but I really should have purchased it sooner. He had already chewed on the sides and he was too used to doing that to make this product effective. He can get his teeth on the underside of the gummi rail and he lifts it up that way and then chews on it."
4,Gummi rails,"Great product it fit perfectly on our crib. My child really does chew on the crib and this helps so much. The only problem I have had is that it is starting to come off now, I will probley super glue it on but that is only because we plan on having another baby, and will need to protect the crib."
4,GREAT WITH SUPER GLUE,I DID NOT LET THIS CURE FOR 8 HOURS (MY LITTLE GUY IS NEVER AWAKE THAT LONG)LIKE DIRECTED SO THAT MAY BE THE PROBLEM BUT IT DID NOT STAY ON ONCE HE STARTED CHEWING. I RAN SOME CRAZY GLUE UNDERNEATH AND NOW IT STAYS. THIS IS A GOOD SOLUTION IF YOU HAVE AN INEXPENSIVE CRIB AND DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE GUARD BEING PERMANENT. I STILL GIVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE NONE OF THE CRIB GUARDS OUT THERE SEEM TO STAY ON AND I REALLY LIKE THE DESIGN OF THIS ONE MUCH BETTER THAN ANY OF THEM.
4,Saved our crib,"This is a great product that I truly believe has saved our crib. My only complaint is that it's a little difficult to apply, and with a crib like mine that has a lot of detail on the rail, it doesn't quite cover everything. So of course my baby managed to find the one inch that wasn't covered and gnawed on the rail, removing some of the finish. However, knowing what my little beaver is capable of, I'm really happy I bought the Gummi rail, or the entire crib would be ruined. Maybe not a big deal if you don't plan on using the crib again or didn't pay a lot of money for it, but when you buy a convertible crib that you want your child to use for many years, this is definitely worth it. I haven't removed it yet so I'm just hoping the finish doesn't come off the crib."
1,I returned this,"After I received this item, I read the box and it said something about how they cannot guarantee the item won't damage your crib finish. I paid a lot for our crib and it's one that will turn into a full size bed some day so I didn't want to risk ruining it. I would like this product if they could figure out an adhesive that won't ruin the finish. Plus, it's HUGE. Unless you want it to overhang the edge of the crib a lot, you should go with the regular sized one."
4,Gummi Crib Rail good for our little rodent!,"We ordered this gummi crib rail for our 8-month old daughter. She already had eight teeth and had already come to think of her crib rail as a teething toy. We have a curved edge to our crib and were not sure if the crib rail would fit. Although it pulls up a bit on the outside edges, it stays stuck tight to the inside and the entire middle of the crib rail. It has helped us to preserve the wood on her crib. We are happy with this product."
1,doesn't stick,"I was really hoping this product would work. The drop side of my son's crib is a little wider, I guess, than other cribs, and the plastic guard I bought before this one did not fit. This one did fit, and after cleaning with alcohol, as suggested, I was able to put the guard on. I left it be for a few hours... however, when I went back to my son's room later (I completely forgot about the rail guard), I noticed half of it was completely peeling. I tried to stick it back on, but it didn't work. Other than not serving its purpose, it makes me nervous that it would peel and my son would chew on whatever glue they use... I'm sorry I threw away the packaging and cannot return--glad this product worked for some people, but it definitely didn't work for me. I'll keep looking--maybe the fabric ones will be better..."
2,Not for All Cribs,"I had to give this product a two-star rating because of the false claim that it fits all cribs. We purchased this for our convertible crib, which has a higher back than front and curved, sloping head and footboards connecting them. The problem I ran into is that the Gummi Crib Rail only had a thin line of adhesive on each side of the strip. So far, it works great on the smooth, flat inside of the head and footboards, but it was not able to adhere well to the outside, which had a small lip right where the adhesive is on the gummi strip. After a good half hour of pressing the gummi strip into the crevice with the edge of a pair of scissors, it seemed to be securely attached - for about four days. No amount of heat seems to be enough to reactivate the adhesive. That said, this product may be perfect for cribs with perfectly flat sides. For anything else, you might want to look elsewhere."
1,"Too Small, Came Off Right Away","Our crib has a larger than standard, but still not huge, rail, and this product is a little too small for it. Also, within seconds of my son starting the bite the rail the guard came off. He was easily able to get his bottom teeth under it and pull it up, and it would not stick back on because he drooled all over the adhesive."
3,Meh!,"Yes, meh... Not that good, but not that bad. We purchased this to immediately go on our new crib. Upon attempting to attach it, the sad thin little adhesive strips that are already on the rail cover do not stick very well. To wood. Unfortunately, it was placed on a box when my daughter attempted to grab the end that was on the floor and I happened to notice that the box stuck rather well. And sadly, it does not come with extra adhesive strips. After purchasing some highly excellent double sided tape, it is now secured and protecting the crib. I wish it was more transparent and my daughter seems to not prefer the taste of it. I guess in the end that's a good thing since it stops her from chewing on the crib. In the end, some good points and some bad points, so I give it a meh."
1,Ineffective,"Our 14 month-old had peeled up this rail guard in only a couple days, taking quite a bit of paint with it. Attempts to reattach it with a hair drier were futile. The decision now is weather or not to leave the semi-attached, unsightly cover on or take it off and let the little guy have complete access to the rail again. There must be a better solution."
2,Not the best purchase,"This crib rail is fairly inflexible, with a poor design in my opinion. The adhesive strips are only on the very sides of the rubber strip. So if you fold the strips over and they don't meet up well with your crib, it does not adhere well. This was the case with our crib, and renders the product fairly useless. Of course, you may not really find this out (at least I did not) until you have cut the rail to size. Although I did not try, this makes it unlikely that a return is feasible.Not impressed."
1,hate it!!!!!!!!!,This looks like it would be nice but after I put it on and waited the time for it to fully stick to the crib it started peeling off the next day... So this product does not work!
1,I should of listened to other reviewers!,We installed this perfectly as instructed and it came off within a day. I wanted it to work so bad I didn't listen to all the other reviewers...baaaaad!
1,Absolutely horrible!,"Followed directions, step by step and within a hour it fell off and took the paint varnish from the crib with it, Stay away!"
4,So relieved!!,"Ok, let me start off by saying I almost did not order at all after reading some of the reviews on this product. Let me just say how pleasantly surprised I was when I tried it out on the crib. It was fast, easy & NO it did not start to come off. When you follow the simple directions, like cleaning first with a little alcohol & making sure it dries down before you start adhering. Just pre cut if you need to, and do small sections at a time & your good to go!! So glad I tried it out for myself!!!"
1,piece of junk,save your money. this is a waste. my daughter pulled it off in a matter of days and was right back to rail munching. We have only had success with the padded clother covers that tie down on the crib rail. I got those here too.
4,Gummi Crib Rail,"After reading the reviews on this, I also super glued the rails on as others have suggested. They have stayed on, only coming off in one part once and I just glued it back.Other than adhesive, I would suggest they give the option of buying a pair."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I never wrote a review before...but do not buy this product...It is so not worth it...it will just be trash. Now I have to buy another crib protector. My son is 15 months and as soon as I put the product on...he just pulled it apart with his teeth. So...I redid it with the Lionheart corner kushion doubled sided stickers that very very studry...but he just pulled them apart instantly with teeth again. I think kids thesedays so smart that they will figure things out instantly. I am now considering to purchase the Leacho one.. I think that will be better. Also, this is suppose to be nontoxic...but isn't the sticky glue side toxic when the child pulls it with their teeth???? I'm pretty sure...If you have a child that catches on quickly, do not buy. just buy the fabric one that you can tie to the bed or velcro or whatever."
2,Worked but took off the finish!,"This worked after our son started chewing on his crib rails. When one of the strips started to come off, the finish (espresso) came off with it. So, it kept it safe while it stayed on, but I wouldn't recommend. Going to go for the softer tie on guards for the next baby to cover up the ruined rails after I peeled off the remaining strips of Gummi Crib Rail."
2,Adhesive didn't stay,"I was a little disappointed in this product, as I followed instructions exactly as to how to put it in place. I let it sit/dry for the recommended time, which was a little inconvenient, only to walk into my son's room the next morning and find it hanging half off the crib rail and the adhesive refusing to go back on with use of hairdryer as also recommended."
1,Nope. Doesn't work at all...,"I bought these rails in spite of the fact that they had bad reviews. Lesson learned. I diligently cleaned the crib rails with rubbing alcohol before I applied the rails. I applied them and let them cure overnight. The next morning, the edges were already peeling up. That afternoon, when I went in to get my little guy out of the crib after his nap, I noticed the edges were now completely detached. This product does not work as advertised and is a total waste of money."
2,Not Impressed,Product did not adhere as well as we thought it should. Would not recommend and would not purchase again.
3,Ok- sort of works.,"I bought 2 of these crib rail protectors when my son started chewing on the rails of his crib. They went on very easily, follow the directions and clean the rails before installing. I bought 2 so I could use one on the front rail and cut the other into 2 pieces for the sides of the crib. The front protector never stayed on, it kept coming off in a few places, I even tried using painters tape to hold it down (baby was not in the crib)that worked for a few hours but then it came off again. I ended up sending this product back and buying a fleece crib protector which has worked very well."
4,Like it,"Easy to install; if you are a perfectionist, take your time removing the adhesive. A great price to protect a long term investment."
1,Would be great if it STICKS.,"Since my little guy is now standing and constantly chewing on his crib rail,this seemed like agreat product and I actually had people recommend it. When it came in, I followed ALL the instructions to the T. I let it sit for the recommended time before leaving my son in his crib because I knew he'd go straight for it. Well, before the I had even put him in the crib, the gummi was popping up in places. I used heat to try to get it to stick (as suggested). My son wasn'tin his crib for 5 minutes and the thing popped up, enticing him to pull it up even more. When I checked on him he had the ""sticky"" part in his mouth. It's been a few days and no matter what it will not stick like it'ssupposed to ,despite following ALL instructions. Very disappointed and complete waste of money. It really would be a great product if it stuck!"
5,Not sure why so many negative reviews,"I have two DaVinci cribs and both babies chew on the rails. I bought two of these to cover my twins' cribs rails (fronts and sides) and have had no issues. They were easy to cut to size and easy to apply. They stick well and the kids haven't been able to lift the edges. All in all, a good purchase.*update* I needed a third set and bought the thinner cover. I prefer the thinner ones. You don't need the wide ones since they babies are not going to be chewing on the outside of the crib rail, only the inside. They adhere well and my twins haven't been able to pull them off (yet). I wish I'd bought 3 sets of the thinner covers and saved a little money. Still haven't had issues with the kids lifting the edges or anything. Still happy with the purchase."
1,These gummy rails do not stick!,"The adhesive on these gummy crib rails do not stay adhered to the crib. When I try to re-adhere them, my son is able to pull up the edge. These are not a good purchase and it is too bad I cannot return them now that I have tried them out."
1,Does not stick,"I had been warned by a friend that she purchased this and it doesn't stick to the crib after a couple days. I bought it anyway, and I soon found out that she was right. It would have been great if it sticked. Then it left glue on his expensive crib railing."
2,Came off in a week!,"The idea of this is really good. It comes in a roll, so you can cut it to whatever size your crib is. I used it on one of the short sides and the front, which is where my baby stared to chew. I used the adhesive like the directions stated, and let it set before I let my baby near it. He used it for about a week before it was off completely. Maybe it's not typical, but he got his bottom teeth under the gummi rail. So finally I took the rest of it off, and with it came the paint off the crib. Now my crib is missing giant chunks of paint and my baby is still chewing on it."
4,saved the crib,The Gummie Rail Guard was a good investment. My daughters crib has larger sides which regular crib guards wouldn't fit. The gummie guards will fit any size. The only problem I found is that the tape which holds them on isn't tacky enough. Don't get me wrong... they work but my daughter found an edge and started lifting off of the crib. I had some left over and put the new piece on and she hasn't bothered with it. Maybe I didn't put it on correctly the first time? Gummie saved my daughter crib from her teeth!
1,Waste of money,We purchased this for our son's Emily convertable crib. The strip never went on firmly from the start and thus didn't stay on at all. I guess if anything it provides him entertainment after waking from his nap in that he can sit there and work at pulling it off...Efforts to get it to re-stick with a hair dryer were futile. Should have spent our money on something else.
3,Tape doesn't stick but it still works,They peel off tape is useless so I used about 4 zip ties to hold it down. My 9 month old daughter now loves to chew her crib rail even more now that it's a built in teether.
2,Does not stick to our crib,"We have a Young America convertible crib. My 9-month-old has chewed the side rails, so there is peeling paint on the rails. I applied this gummi saver and at first I thought it was great, but two days later, the stickiness has come undone and the part of the gummi saver the he chewed on has popped off. My son now chews the gummi rail saver and the rail. Not to mention, the white paint peeled off WITH the gummi saver, so the crib looks even worse.Will be buying the Easy Teether side rails. Wish I had bought those to begin with, as I bought the long rail Easy Teether and it works great."
1,Wish it had worked...,"Well, it's a good idea..but really doesn't stick well.Our child has pulled it up.We followed the directions to use rubbing alcohol to first clean - but didn't work.Ended up purchasing the GoMamaGo tie-on crib guard - much better!"
1,Doesn't stick,"I tried this on my son's crib, but it did not stick. I have an Oeuf crib, with straight bars that are finished with non-toxi paint, but I can't imagine that would make a difference. I would highly recommend not purchasing this."
1,didn't work on a stokke crib,"tried this for our stokke crib, our daughter chewed it off in one night and it wouldn't stick back on. Got the cloth product and it works great"
2,A dissapointment,This did not work well at all. The concept is great but the execution is lack-luster. It started peeling off and I had to end up removing it. I guess with larger railing there really isnt much hope!
1,Came off right away,"Kidkusion Gummi Crib RailOverall, this product sounded like a good idea and came off the next day. Don't buy it."
1,Came right off!,"We followed the directions exactly, even cleaning the wood with alcohol and letting it set. Sure enough, the next morning part of the protector was already starting to lift off."
1,Waste of $$$,These crib rail protectors did not work well. The glue strip on these does not stick well to the crib. I followed all direction for applying them to my daughters crib. At first they stuck but just 2 days later they were coming up. I ended up returning these.
5,"working out great, should have bought it three months earlier","After reading reviews, I applied it using a hair dryer. I should have measured it when lining it up on the crib rail, because by eyeballing it, I messed up and had to re-apply. It has been on there for a few weeks, and my son would much rather chew it than the unprotected side rails. It's on as firmly as the day I applied it, even after some pretty hot days. I applied to a stained and lacquered finished crib. I cleaned it with rubbing alcohol and the rag came away a little brown, so be careful when cleaning finished wood."
1,Didn't Last One Day,"I purchased these thinking that with the adhesive they would stay on the crib. Well I was wrong, in the morning when I went to get my son, he had already taken one end of the crib rail off and was working on chewing underneath. I think with the slobber, the adhesive gets wet and does not adhere. I wouldn't waste my money on these. I have ended up purchasing fabric protectors with ties, to see if they work better."
4,Gummi Crib Rail,I am not giving it 5 stars because my son has been able to peel the rail off the bed. He is not quite 2. It didn't fit our crib snuggly in all areas but it is a nice texture for kids to teeth on. It washes well and adds padding.
1,dislike!,this product ruins the crib and your child can easily pull off the rubber. complete child safety hazard and will destroy your crib!!!!
1,Waste of money,Son chews everything!! I call him my little beaver. We put this on and the adhesive came off the inner side of the crib. He lifts it off with his teeth.
2,good idea,Customer service is good but the product did not work for me. The first one only stuck in a few places and were it did stick when I removed it paint came with it. They sent a second one for me to try but scared to put it on afraid it may ruin crib more.
1,What a waste!!!!,I bought this so that my son won't chew on his crib and he figured out to removed it from the crib the same day I put it on. The material is very durable but the stick on pad is a poorly made. It does not re-attach to the rails once is remove. In the end I spend $12.00 for nothing.
1,Pulled wood off of crib,These were great at protecting my son and the wood underneath until my son pulled off one of the pieces and it came with some of the wood! I had to sand down where the strip came off.
2,"good idea, poor execution",These would be awesome if they stuck. I used the rubbing alcohol and applied them to the crib following the instructions to the T but they peeled up in less than a day. I did not stretch them at all so I know that isn't the problem. The adhesive is just too weak.
1,My baby pulled it off,"I wish I would have paid more attention to other reviewers. I was careful to clean the rail with alcohol as the instructions suggest, but it didn't seem to make a difference. My 12 month old was able to rip the plastic off with his teeth very easily."
4,"Great product, but buy extra","I did not read carefully enough about what length of product was in the box, so I now need to order an extra box. This was my fault, but still, I would appreciate packaging that would include enough to cover an entire crib, since that is it's marketed purpose. Other than that it's fantastic!Putting it on was smooth and easy and I've had no issues with peeling or otherwise since I put it on 2 weeks ago. My 15 month old isn't bothered by it and my 3 year old has not targeted it (yet) as something to mess with."
