4,I liked it,"A good mystery, well developed characters, believable story line at a great price...what more could I want? I like to feel like I'm there...and with this book, I did."
4,Great start to a series!,"I don't read many books outside the realm of horror (love me some zombies!) but got this book as part of a collection of five and decided to take a shot and read it, not being a huge fan of detectives and thrillers and cliche' stories... I was pleasantly surprised by this book!It starts out a bit slow, where you're trying to get the feel for each character, especially Laura Cardinal, our main one. But once the story begins moving along you get into the quirks and unique traits of them, and that's what makes the story move at a nice steady pace. Too often, with a big cast of minor characters, suspects, etc. you lose focus on who is who, but the author keeps everyone seaparate with their own characteristics and uniqueness.I'll be reading more in this series!Armand Rosamilia"
3,"It was ok, not great...","I'm not usually one to reveiw things, but it's a slow day at work so here you go!I purchased Darkness on the Edge of Town for 2 reason - it was cheap (.99c) and the plot sounded interesting. However, I could just not get into it. I had to almost force myself to finish it (I very rarely give up on a book!) There seemed to be too many characters and they all got confusing after while. Plus, the dead guy popping up randomly was annoying! The pace would be going along nicely and then out of seemingly nowhere, a dead colleauge of the main character would come into the story again and be interacting with the lead (Laura Cardinal).All in all it was an ok book. Not sure if I'll try the next Laura Cardinal book though (maybe if it's .99c!). Maybe the next one will be better..."
2,Trying to cram in too much,"I'll try one more Laura Cardinal mystery because A)I live in AZ where the novels take place, and B) I think the author has a decent narrative voice. But the plot was needlessly complicated (and ended up collapsing from its own weight). Characters behaved inconsistently (and uninterestingly) as they did little more than move the plot along. Hoping for better luck next time."
3,eehh!!,"Not good but not bad either. It does start off rather slow and is hard to get into. I found myself considering it to be scripted more like a csi episode instead of a good book. I know some of the reviews compared this author to LJ Sellers but I personally don't see the comparison. LJ's books are of a much higher caliber in my opinion. Again, not bad but very average."
3,Almost,"4/5 of the way thru, the plot collapses under the weight of coincidence and implausibility. Up to that point, not a bad effort. But that last fifth was painful."
2,VERRRRRRRY SLOOOOOOOOW,"I FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ALL THE CHARACTERS, MANY THAT THERE WERE IT MOVED WAY TO SLOW FOR ME"
3,VERY confusing,"Is it just me, or did this author pull names of characters out of a hat and slap them into the story at random intervals? Half the time, I couldn't figure out what was going on because I would see the name of some random person and then spend ten minutes trying to figure out who he/she was. Waste of time. Note to the author: the readers are not omniscient. Explain your characters. Very confusing and disjointed story. The idea on the serial killer was kind of freaky, which is why I gave this book three stars, but overall the story was pretty slow. I had a pretty hard time getting into it and it only seemed to pick up about three-quarters of the way through. Heaven knows where the five-star ratings came from. People must have very low standards for their reading material."
4,LAURA CARDINAL ** BOOK ONE,DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN by J. Carson Black is book one of the Laura Cardinal series. Cardinal is an investigator for the Arizona Department of Public Safety. And we get to know a lot about her in this initial offering. Assigned to investigate a death in a small town she gets the local resisitance and thrust into a deep involved case. A great first novel. I am looking forward to the next book. RECOMMENDED
4,A well-written debut,"Overall a well-written first novel that will keep your attention. And having lived in southern Arizona I particularly liked the setting and the references to familiar places. I think this author has room for improvement but that's a good thing for anyone who wants to read more of this series. After a solid beginning I thought the story bogged down with too many minor characters. It lost focus for a bit but it picked up again in the last third or so of the book. My only other criticism is that the ending was a bit forced and implausible and I don't think she needed to go that route. But, again, a good first effort that's enjoyable to read with signs of better novels to follow."
4,Hard to put down!!!,"I love a mystery, and when the price of 99 cents for a thriller came up on Amazon, I downloaded it a few days ago. I have about a hundred pages left on my Kindle, and I'm losing precious sleep to keep reading it! It did start out rather slow, too many characters, but half-way into this mystery, it becomes nail-biter, making me want to lecture my grandkids to stay away from the computer...even though they are great kids. My favorite line from Laura goes something like this: Mothers and fathers of preteens and teens still look at the computer as just another modern appliance; whereas, they should put a lock and key on it to protect their precious ones from the dark side of the night...mostly my words, but you get the picture. I'm looking forward to seeing Laura in action in the follow-up second book!!"
2,Boring,I downloaded this book on my Kindle because it was cheap and had good reviews. I wished I had not bothered. It started out very very slow and introduced too many characters in the beginning. It was very confusing. It wasn't until I reached 50% complete did I get somewhat interested in the story. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
3,I think I missed something - SPOILER ALERT,"The only time I have to read is late at night when I get into bed, so maybe I was just tired while reading it and missed some important details. After wading through too many confusing characters, the plot finally wound up exposing the ""bad guys"". But who killed who? Who raped who? The ending explanation said that Lundy murdered 4 girls, but did he rape them or was the raping and torturing only done by the other two ""perps""? It was never explained. Unless I was totally asleep while reading the ending, it never specifically said who shot Jay many years before, although the reader can assume it was his friends, who were the other two ""perps"". This book had potential, but had too many characters, and the writing was confusing.The editing was very poorly done. In one case, Laura was talking to one person, and in the very next sentence, he was referred to by the wrong name.I gave the book three stars instead of one because it was an interesting story."
3,Entertaining first book,"Solid police procedural, a bit uneven but good for a first book. I had concerns because of the teenage victims (I am SO tired of whiny, sullen, spoiled, eye-rolling, anti-social brats!) but the teenage victim in this was a pleasant surprise. Scared but tough-minded and smart and the 'dumb stuff' was understandable in a teenager. In fact, I think she might have been my favorite character in this book although I do wish I'd liked her father (one of the cops) better as a character.Plot was perhaps more convoluted than it needed to be but a good sense of place. An entertaining read but I'm not sure why I didn't get hooked into the book as thoroughly as I'd expected. I am a very character-driven reader so I have the feeling I'm just not connecting there. Isn't on my 'keep to re-read' list but will try another book or two in the series to see how it develops."
5,Loved the book but way too many things going on!!,"I loved the book. Loved the character of Laura, and I was very interested in the story! Read the book in 3 days and stayed up till late at night, not being able to put it down. However, (SPOILER ALERT!!) When I got to around 80% I thought I was reading another book!! There were just way too many things going on and I got confused as to who did what to whom!! It was a bit overwhelming and frustrating when all of a sudden many different things were happening right after another. Also, I didn't think the author needed to have the dead guy (ghost) keep popping up. I felt it was unneccasary and annoying. Otherwise I loved the book. I will continue to read this author's other book. Her style was excellent, well-written!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"If you want a biography of Patsy Cline, save your money and do not buy this book. You will be much happier with Patsy Cline: Honky Tonk Angel by Ellis Nassour. This author adds nothing to Patsy's story but a lot of boring dribble."
3,Doesn't do Patsy justice,"I had high hopes for this book- especially considering the forward was penned by Loretta Lynn. However, I'm not a big fan of this work whatsoever. It's not an easy read and I certainly never felt that 'I just can't put this book down' feeling. The author veers off too often onto long side-tracks about the recording industry...tangents that I found boring. Obviously some info is necessary- considering Patsy was a recording artist, after all. I just found myself skipping a lot of pages in an attempt to get back the main story line.I purchased this book at the same time as Ellis Nassour's 'Honky Tonk Angel: The Intimate Story of Patsy Cline.' I've started reading it- and I can say it's already a lot more interesting and captivating. It seems that Jones' borrows a LOT from Nassour's work.On the fair side- there was information in Jones' book that was interesting- particularly in the last half. You just had to wade through a lot to get to it."
2,Repeat,"I find this book has lots of info that seems to come from another Patsy Book, rememebr to check the back cover on this book, it will tell you who was credited for borrowed info!BobPOP"
1,One Step Up from Tabloid Trash,"This book is nothing but gossip, innuendos and plagiarism from a much better biography about Patsy Cline. The author seems to imply that Patsy Cline was a slut and a lesbian, who supposedly slept her way to the top. HELLO? Did she ever listen to any of Patsy Cline's songs? Patsy Cline was, is and will always be, the best female singer, ever! Patsy Cline was talent with a capital ""t"" and capitals ""a,l,e,n"" and another ""t"" for that matter! Don't waste your money, like I did, buying this trash. I, myself, wouldn't even dare to subject anybody else to this book, by trying to resell or give it away!"
5,Pheremones,This is my most favorite perfume ever and I'm so glad to have found it so cheap on here. Thank you. Took 2 weeks on standard to get here. Was nothing wrong with it. I'm wearing it right now. Smells great.
3,My Opinion,"After trying Pure Instinct for only a couple of weeks now, being an attractant, has not gotten me any compliments, but, I have noticed female co-workers walking by a lot more than they have been. This product has a nice fragrance, is oil based, but, I do not know how long the fragrance lasts on me. Maybe, if I keep using it more, like everyday, they might come out and say something rather than stand around you."
4,Like!,"I really like this product, the smell is unique and lasts for awhile. I also saw this product in a Temptations Party catalog for over double what I paid here (Same size and all!)"
3,Keep out of sun!,"When I first got it, it worked great. People couldn't get enough of me. People at work kept hugging me, people lingered around longer to talk to me, I got asked out on 2 dates by coworkers who have known me for a year. But it sat in the car in the sun for a day or two, and suddenly it wasn't working. I think it still smells great but people don't seem to notice anymore, not even if I tell them to directly smell the area I applied it. I used it everyday for a month then periodially afterwards. I would buy again but keep it in a cool place to see if that makes a difference."
2,Not a fan.,"When I first smelled this in the bottle, I LOVED it! But after a while of wearing it, as the floral, sweet notes wore off, it got a musty smell that kind of 'catch' in the back of my throat when I would get a whiff of it. It did not have the effect that the other product I purchased."
4,Fabulous Smell - Not Nessisarily for Men,"I LOVE this perfume. The smell is fabulous and fruity, I just wish it lasted longer! I carry it around with me so that I can reapply it through out the day because it dissipates quickly. I probably have to reapply 3-4x a day to keep the smell going. If it lasted longer I would give it 5 stars but whatever, it smells amazing and makes me feel sexy.I cannot say if this is a sex-attract perfume because in all honesty I am a lesbian and there doesn't seem to be a difference in my sex life if I wear it and I don't get hit on by males any more than usual so...yeah. Because of the fruity smell I would not say this is 'Unisex"" because it is not particularly manly. But hey, if you guys out there love to smell sweet and delicious by all means buy it! I love it!"
4,Smells great but doubt it really has pheramones,"I ordered this because the reviews were good and the price was more than reasonable. The first bottle I had lasted me for well over 4 months. I ended up ordering a new bottle just because I love the smell so much. I'm not sure about it being a sex attractant with pheromones though. I will wear it out clubbing and some nights I have guys all over me and some nights I don't. However, I'll keep buying it because it smells great and I always get a lot of compliments when wearing it. The only reason it got 4/5 stars from me is because I feel it's a little misleading with the pheromone/sex attractant label.As for the seller, they're quick with shipping, I've had no complaints, and they sell this bottle cheaper than anywhere else I've searched. No problems makes me a happy shopper and will continue to buy from DSC."
3,Not my thing,"I was expecting something a bit different and when I tried it at first the scent was pleasant, but very quickly turned on me."
4,Smells nice...,"It smells really fruity, like all the other reviews. I doubt it does anything for ""attraction"" but it really does smell nice. I use it when I want to get compliments that day for a couple hours."
1,dissatisfaction,This product has a good smell but doesn't do anything of what it says. I've been wearing it for a week now. Better to just think of it as a perfume and nothing more.
2,"Smells nice, but doesn't seem to work","I have tried using this two different ways and neither way seems to work. When I first bought it, I applied this on every day, and it had a nice aroma but it didn't have any noticeable affect on people around me. Then later on, I tried it on and off every once in a while and still seemed like it wasn't doing anything. The idea is nice, but I just didn't have any luck with it."
5,I like it,"I guess the saying goes like you get what you pay for?Well with this stuff I got more than I payed for, in my job I got about $40 in tips! Yes it was Christmas but let's not forget that usually never happens. I am in a janitorial kind of job.I have shared a little with a friend. We are both guys in our 20's and we like the idea that we can use this as an edge. For $10 what do you have to lose really?"
4,Good for the price,"Glad I didn't buy it at a Passion Party where it cost $22!It smells great. It doesn't attract people like I thought it would (it's not like Love Potion #9 lol) but people always ask what I'm wearing. To me, it can smell like a variety of things, since it smells different on everyone, like cotton candy, fruit punch, or a musky scent. People have told me it smells like something from Victoria's Secret, coconut, or like I came from the beach. I tried it on my boyfriend and it had more of a musky scent than when it was on me.It doesn't last very long, at most 2 or 3 hours. I'm never able to smell any perfumes when I spray them on my neck but if I sweat, the fragrance smells stronger and I'm able to smell this one."
2,"Smells good, doesn't attract though","I give this product 2 stars because it smells good, it's really very pleasant but fades fairly quickly. If I'm wearing it just as a fragrance it's ok. But I purchased this as a pheromone product hoping to see results. I've worn this for 5 days, 3 days around someone who I know likes me. He didn't show any more attention than usual. I haven't noticed any special attention or friendly behavior from any people that I've been around. No more than usual. I can't recommend this to attract people or make people more pleasant/friendly around you."
1,Extremely Overpowering,Was not a light and sensual smell. Made my eyes water and was extremely overpowering. Smells really feminine so I don't suggest this to anybody.
2,It does not work,I tried the product and I don't think it works. It just gives you the feeling that it smells like pheromones but doesn't work at all
1,It just wasn't a real unisex product as advertised .......,..........if the cologne smells like watermelons. No straight male wants to smell like watermelons. I had purchased a similar product in the same bottle and everything before but forgot who I bought it from. Loved it. The fragrance was a clean ultra soap and pheromone explosion. Not this product.
1,Gender-friendly???,"This is definitely for females. It has a very fruity smell which is ok for a chick but not for a dude. Pheromones aside, I could see myself liking this smell on a girl."
3,Smells nice,"It has a nice fruity scent, but as far as attracting the opposite sex...well it doesn't lol, just nice perfume is all"
4,Jelique Pure Instinct,"I originally found this product at a party. I loved the way it smelled but wasn't willing to pay $22 for it. Luckily it was on here for a lot less. This version has a fruitier smell than the other one, but I love it. I don't really think it actually attracts the opposite sex, but it does make for good perfume."
2,Can't really give a review,"When it came in the mail it was obviously leaking a little bit, the inside of envelope was moist. I tried it once, seems to have nice light scent, but even with cap on tight it leaked all over my purse and I had to throw it out. What a mess! Can't say that I would recommend this to anyone unless they change the packaging and the way that this is shipped. Not worth the hassle of trying to get refund because wasn't very expensive and would be to much more of a mess to return. Hopefully I can find another product that is similar that is given more care in packaging. Overall not happy, but can't knock actual product because of inability to use."
5,Love it.,"I love it, just wish it would last longer. Very unique smell and there is nothing else that smells like that."
2,lol,"I bought this because I was interested in the topic sinces somebody had mentioned it ,I was like okay let me google it and this came up...You make yourself feel how ever you want to feel,no need to put on crap on yourself LOL,it's ridiculous and it smells awful,ew I threw it out in a couple of days after I bought it thinking"" aw okay lets see if the smell gets better or something"".. A WASTE OF MONEY,"
4,I like it,"After about 3 days of using this product I noticed a rise in my confidence level and I even became friendlier. The smell is nice and subtle. I'm not sure how it effected those around me, but it may have helped me a few times on a ""pure instinct"" level."
4,Worth a try!,"First im a 23 straight guy who just wanted to experiment with pheromones and see for myself if they worked. At first i was skeptical but i put down a ten to try this product and from personal experience i found that when i wear this cologne i feel better about myself i guess its like a boost of self esteem and also i have realized a lot more people will open up to me faster in a conversation. The smell is amazing almost intoxicating and all the girls LOVE the scent, i got alot more numbers lately and i believe its due to the help of this product. The only complaint i have is that the scent wears off after a few hours but the pheromones keep on working."
1,Disgusted,"This product is a pure sham. I'm a straight guy and this stuff smells like straight up women's perfume. There is no way the stuff that attracts men will attract women. Positive does not attract positive, only positive and negative do.The company claims that it is uni-sex, but I was smarter than that and I got my answer from pherone science:Pheromones are sexually dimorphic, which means that they effect each sex differently. So male pheromones typically affect women and female pheromones affect men.The difference, then, is that they are entirely different chemicals.SO then it is completely ineffective. If you are a male wanting to attract a female this is not for you. I've just wasted [...]! This will not attract females due to it being uni-sex, and smelling like a chick perfume. I've got to say though it could work for the ladies. Till then its just gross that they even label it for the both sexes.I'm looking to attract one sex. Not both.Cheers"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Waste of time, does not work, just scented liquid.Around parties, and social gatherings all the time, didnt see a difference."
2,Placebo Effect ?,"I can see all of this as being the result of the well known placebo effect; and on the other hand the product seems designed to elicit comments owing to it's aroma; women like more fruity scents in their perfumes so surely a man wearing something that smells, um, fruity, is more likely to get ""looks"" and ""comments"" from women. It boils down to how you interpret the stares I guess. That said, I haven't tried this product. I did try a hair product that was said to contain phermones and it had a distinct odor. When I smelt the same product on another guy I stopped using it as I thought it made him seem desperate."
5,Great for the right audience,"I have not done this study on the Kindle but have done the paper back version. I love Kay Arthur! This study is evangelistic in nature and is not geared toward the ""mature"" Christian. The audience it attempts to reach is the seeker or new Christian who doesn't want to do tons of homework. That is why this is the only study e-book of hers that is .89. It is geared for evangelism! It is also meant for small groups, but can easily be done individually as I did it. Kay Arthur is known for her tough inductive Bible studies. If you want meaty, get involved in a Precept class. You will learn so much just as I have. Otherwise, her Lord series is good. I recommend ""Lord, I want to know You!"" which focuses on the names of God. Very good! Otherwise, do this book with the mindset of helping others come to know Christ."
3,Good for Guideline,"Our small group chose this study for our meetings and have enjoyed the conversations it has sparked. We have been using the book more as a guide than word-for-word, as some of the questions are very elementary, for example, ""Read Romans 3:23. Who are sinners?"" This is not a direct quote, but there are questions like that in the study. We have learned some things, and it is good for beginners, but anyone interested in a more indepth study should keep looking."
4,good,"I wanted a personal Bible study and this was more for a small group so it wasn't what I expected, but will still be good to use with a small group of friends."
4,Pre-Hyacinth,"These stories are sly! Most of the humor lies in what is not being told to you as a reader. Eliza is the name of the wife of the narrating character (you never know what his name is). He is pompous and arrogant, and the best part is how he gets his come-uppance, which you know he will.This is a collection of short stories, and they are easily read. The hard part is putting the book down.The narrating character reminds me of Hyacinth Bucket. The difference lies in the character of Eliza, who will sometimes acquiesce to the demands of her obnoxious husband, but more than likely will give him what for!On a purely shallow level, these stories are terrific fun! On a deeper level, you understand a bit more about human nature and frailty, and the necessity of having a relatively sane person around to keep you on track.I even enjoyed the preface by Terry Jones! (And I usually think prefaces are a waste of good paper!)"
5,A Masterpiece of Literature Linking Ireland and Barbados,"Born in London and being of Irish decent myself; also having suffered living in Barbados for almost 10 years, I found this book very readable indeed. I'd truly love to meet the lady that wrote this masterpiece. I don't have any fancy words to add here - just my sincere thanks... thanks very much Kate McCafferty for turning me onto a whole aspect of my heritage I knew nothing about. After this I read ""To Hell or Barbados"" by Sean O'Callaghan and it's a historical account (not a novel) of the ""ethnic cleansing of Ireland"" and truly a shocking read. Thank you."
1,Does not do this imprtant piece of history justice,"I really did not enjoy this book. This little known element of Irish history deserves far more literature on the subject, which I've discovered is hard to find. I was hoping this book would be captivating, but it simply is not. While the idea of the story is a compelling idea, it is so poorly written that I found myself not caring about the main character and wishing she would die so the book would end. The ""voice"" the author gives her main character is, most of the time, unbelievable... especially for one who is an uneducated slave. The authors' style of going between narrative of past events and the book's present day doesn't work well, and was at times frustrating. The fact that I made it through this book at all is amazing. I kept hoping for some wonderful moment to make the whole book worth it, but it never came."
4,Emotional and touching.,"A very touching book. A heart felt story about a woman who was taken as a child and turned into a slave.An Irish slave. I enjoyed this book. It flowed a little different than most books I read but over all I did enjoy it very much. It is a good story, touching, and it will surely make you feel for the conditions and the situation that All Slaves have been in."
3,3 Stars For a Great Effort,I'm sorry but I couldn't finish this book. I tried really hard but I couldn't keep my eyes open while reading it. I usually like books like this but this one put me to sleep. The topic of this book is a really great idea and if it was written a little differently it could make a fantastic book. Cot seemed like a really strong character that went through a lot of horrible things during her life. I know I'd be upset if I was kidnapped and sold into slavery against my own will! It was a great attempt that didn't quite make it for me personally.
3,"Great History, Poor Story","I liked the book - but found myself feeling depressed while reading it. Being Irish I appreciated the little-told history of sending people to Barbados. However, I found myself growing weary of the main character never getting a break - ever. The few fleeting instances of happiness she experiences are ruthlessly stomped out as soon as possible. I know some have it tough in this world, but to relay the important historical messages this book attempts to portray, it might help if the story were compelling. The history is rightfully agonizing, the story needn't be."
5,Another smashing success,"As the principal of a primary schoool in Maine, I'd had the opportunity to see Rick perform on several occasions. His songs are wildly popular with the children. They sing along, knowing every word. Rick's music is an integral part of every classroom program."
5,"""Alligator"" Muzak",One of the best children's music albums that I've ever heard. We first heard these songs by theoriginal artist when our family was young and camped @ Papoose Pond in Maine! I bought this formy grandchildren.
5,Beau Jest,"There are only a few books/movies which makes me smile and laugh. This is one of them. I have been to several plays in the Mesa, Arizona area which produce this story. It is a classic!!!!"
4,A good variation on a great scent,"I bought this body spray for my girlfriend and she loves it. She already had the Bvlgari White perfume and we both really love the scent. The bottle is pretty big for the price but it's not as potent as the perfume. It's an emulsion, with a lotion-y feel to it, so I wouldn't recommend spraying it on clothes.Overall a very good buy."
1,Silly nonsense,The characters are all a mess...Psycho time. The heroine cop and sudden detective is so foolish an immature it is laughable. A stupid romance is in the works. The villain is a retread of many other evil villains and the plot is silly beyond belief. Kid events makes a snubbed boy set on a decades long journey of revenge by killing a humungous number of people following the rules of kid games like monopoly and Boggle. The heroine is of course captured and suffers what should have been disabling injuries many times (but she pluckily goes on unfortunately...the book needed more chapters) until the bitter end and boy was it bitter. Skip this piece of nonsense. It starts off like it should have been a good book but a bullet shot in a floor suddenly shoves the author in la la land. The book is pretty unreadable after that. I really shouldn't complain because this was a freebie; all I did was waste some time.
5,Gericke scores a hit!,"Rookie cop Emily Thompson knows someone wants her dead; bodies are turning up with links to her, links that track back to her childhood. But the bodies are getting closer, and Emily knows the killer is shooting to make his move on her birthday, only a few days away. Can she outfox him and remain alive, or will this killer win the final game?Shane Gericke has penned a page turner that will keep you up until the wee hours of the night. His writing sparkles, flows like water over worn rock. Smooth. But with suspense that will drive you to turn those pages."
3,ok,not a very good book. good thing it was free. free download onto my kindle. wouldnt have paid for this book
2,Unable to stay absorbed due to bad dialogue writing,"I admit not to have finished this book, but since it is not the story itself I am writing about, then I feel like my criticism is still valid. I read about a quarter of the book and have no problem with the story. Even if the rest of the story gets better and better and has a smashing ending, I still cannot enjoy the book due to bad dialogue writing.I am a huge fan of police procedurals and crime fiction in general. Good dialogue is one of the most important aspects for me, and it is impossible for me to become absorbed in a story if the dialogue is written like it is a bad play. Unfortunately, Blown Away was like that. Gericke surely tries to write good dialogue, but the result is a complete failure. I think he had a good thriller on his hands, and so I will give it 2 stars rather than 1, but it is surely not the kind of book I can enjoy."
5,blown away by great debut,this book is a real page turner.i could feel the tension and excitement immediately.the serial killer is a horrible character.the dialogue creates a lot of the excitement.i await more by mr. gericke.
4,Gripping,"Well-written and realistic. As a retired Detective Sergeant in law enforcement, I was able to relate to the flow of the plot line."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"This was a fast-moving, interesting book. Once into it, I couldn't put it down! Anyone that loves a mystery will love it. I can't wait to read the next one!"
2,Why not try an Edgar Award Winner (Adult Mystery) instead ?,"My book club, several women from Naperville where the book is set, read this one. We found Blown Away disappointing. The voices, especially of the younger characters, don't ring true. I'm glad I checked it out of the library instead of buying it. Give me a high-quality mystery like The Big Bad City or Fuzz by Ed McBain"
4,Lasted 7 years,"Bought one in 2002. Floor model, a little beat up. Awesome picture. Lasted 7 years. Just went out on me, sorry to say. Was great while it lasted."
2,Disappointing,This set is disappointing. The quality is less than it should be. I recommend trying something else; there are better.
3,Little Single Person Cook Kit,I mistakenly purchased this product to compliment my Coleman 12 piece Enamelware cook set. The Exponent Solo Cook Kit is much too small cook the food for the 12 peice Enamelware Set. I would only purchase this cook kit if I was a backpacker which I am not
3,Does not measure up - I was disappointed!,"IMHO, this book falls flat. I just couldn't get into it. I found it borderline boring, but was determined to keep reading after all the hype & the Amazon.com rating thinking that with each turn of the page there would be something to capture me. It didn't happen. I did not find it suspenseful or particularly mysterious & it was no page-turner for me!"
3,It's okay...,"This was my first book by Jonathan King. While on the hunt for a great mystery novel I started with the first in his Max Freeman Series. Overall the story was entertaining enough but the main ""twist"" of him becoming a suspect in the murder of a young girl and more events that followed was overly contrived and unbelievable. I continued to think... ""Why would they suspect him? - His past is not nearly enough to establish credibility as an kidnapper and innocent child killer."" It was distracting throughout the rest of the novel."
4,My review:,The blue edge of midnight is a well written entertaining book. The plot is well laid out and keeps you guessing until the final chapter.
2,Interesting...,"but not involving. The plot was a good one and the characters showed promise...but no more than promise. The main character's introspection did not convince, and his lawyer/friend--by far the more interesting of the two--never quite came alive. I'll read another one, but only if it gets rave reviews first. I just hate being disappointed."
2,"Evocative title, but....","I wanted to like this book, I really did, but it just didn't involve me. Too much brooding by the main character, Max Freeman, & too many assumptions by Max that he is the intended target of a set-up. I liked his friend, Billy Manchester, but wondered why Billy was so solicitious. Just too many gaps in the character development for them to be believable."
5,An underated record by an underated artist,"I highly recommend Watch Me Fall (or any record) by Kevin Clay. This guy has talent and this record is a proof of that. All the tracks on this one are great but standouts include ""Squeaky Clean"",""Adam"",""Watch Me Fall"",and ""Seed"". if you are a fan of honest music where the artists calls it as he sees it whether about others or himself you will love this record. Its great guitars,great production,and great writing. I dont regret getting it and you wont either."
4,"Quiet, unassuming, seriously underappreciated brilliance...","It's an utterly wonderful album. I won't use the phrase 'gut-wrenchingly honest' because it's become such a cliche, but the term certainly applies. Mr. Clay's life is quite a story, all told on ""Watch Me Fall""... way too humbling and truthful, a serious pouring out of the soul, to ever become really popular, but I'll personally cherish this album always."
3,Deadlands 2,"I liked this movie. Even though it was cheaply made and had some plot holes, it wasn't bad for the most part. The people actually tried to get away from the zombie horde, but securing their position would have been much better (IMO). They don't pull any punches and I like that in a zombie movie, it's always best when everyone gets killed. The filming and acting could have been better, but hey - is Hollywood putting out any good zombie movies in the same quantity as independents? Die hard zombie fans have to take what they can get, even if sometimes the quality isn't there, but this movie delivers on the most fundamental zombie movie points - zombie hordes, zombies eating flesh, panic, being trapped, and needing to come up with a plan in order to escape. Let's face it, unless one is completely prepared for a zombie apocalypse, one is not going to know how to respond, and stupid people will do stupid things."
3,Watchable,It had bad acting but was watchable. Some of the zombies looked good while others had cheap makeup. All in all not a bad movie to watch when bored. The ending sucked though.
3,"Good Book, Liked Hollywood Dealmaking Too","Guber if FUNNY! Liked it. Another great book is ""hollywood dealmaking"" by Dina Appleton. Check it out too!"
5,A very good introduction into TP concepts,"This book is a very good introduction to transaction processing. It did a wonderful job of explaining concepts, and gave concise, clear examples. I would recommend this book as a primary text for anyone wanting to get an overview of the main TP ideas, with the Gray & Reuter book as a supplemental text. The book is very readable, too."
4,Good light-weight introduction,"This book provides a pretty good introduction to transaction processing in easy to understand language. However, if you are planning to get into the more technical aspects, I suggest going straight to Jim Gray's Transaction Processing because it has basically has everything this book has, and a lot more."
5,A warning (not a review),"People like Blaha and Box should be disqualified from writing reviews here, because of potential conflict of interest. That is, unless their reviews are negative (how likely is that <g>?) They belong to the same 'gang' of tech. writers and therefore are to be distrusted as a matter of policy. These guys will praise one another no matter what--it's better ot look for a common man's feedback."
3,An introduction at best. You'll need another book as well.,"Having read lots of technical books, I found this one to be the least impressive. I found sloppy and inconsistent use of terms and language which often caused ambiguity in an explanation. The authors wrote as if they were summarizing ideas to close friends who already knew what they were talking about instead of spelling it out for the rest of us. I would look elsewhere for a treatment of this subject."
5,Philosophy: History and Problems,This book was an excellent purchase. It was exactly as described and arrived promptly. I would definitly do further business with seller in the future.
3,Philosophy book,"Although I still have yet to recieve my book, I'd like to take this chance to ""take back"" my bad review on Kristyna. She sent the book the day I ordered it, but unfortunately the Postal Service is extremely slow. Kristyna has worked with me in a timely manner and it's been greatly appreciated."
1,History?? Trash.,"""Slavery, as it operated in the pervasively Christian society which was the old South, was not an adversarial relationship founded upon racial animosity. In fact, it bred on the whole, not contempt, but, over time, mutual respect. This produced a mutual esteem of the sort that always results when men give themselves to a common cause. The credit for this startling reality must go to the Christian faith. . . The unity and companionship that existed between the races in the South prior to the war was the fruit of a common faith.""Oh really? ""United and companionship"".That Robert E. Lee was a great man and general is not in dispute. Suggesting that a whole race of people kept in chains as subhuman, not to mention the next 100+ years of opression after the Civil War, were happy slaves who respected their masters because they shared Christianity is appalling. Simple appalling.There are many great books on Robert E. Lee that deserve reading. This man's trash does not."
2,fact or fiction?,"I've read a number of civil war books. Lee is represented in this book and others as a remarkable and brilliant general, good christian, loving husband and father. Some of the anecdotes, however, left me incredulous. While under fire, he allegedly stopped to put a baby sparrow back in it's nest. Lee was no doubt a brave man, but he wasn't foolhardy nor stupid. this anecdote made me question the veracity of the others in this book. I wished the last half of the book had been incorporated into his life story portion in the first half of the book. Because of the way the author told Lee's story, it seemed to go on and on."
2,Great American Traitor,"Robert E. Lee was one of the greatest traitors in American history. He violated his oath of office to take up arms against the United States of America, and should have been held accountable for his acts as all traitors throughout history."
1,No one would even care about this book...,"...If it wasn't for Mrs Bachmann mentioning it on her website as recommended reading...that being said, the real point is to what extent does she endorse the context of the book, which is clearly a work of Neo-confederate civil war revisionism (and not one of the better ones I might add). The historical truth is that Lee was a traitor to his country, and if he was a defender of his fellow man like so many say he was, where was he in defense of the 100's of thousands of slaves that needed defending? Lee took the moral low road if indeed his heart was in a different place and he felt slavery was wrong. I thought great men lived by and died for what they beleived in..."
5,Great CD Must Have!,"This CD just kicks it never stops and has great bass and drum beats it's an all around great CD, Sandra Collins is a really great DJ and releases nothing but best sellers."
5,One of the best trance DJs in the world,"I put her at #2, just (barely) below Christopher Lawrence. This CD is amazing - her sounds are very unique, yet it is still a very ""pure"" trance album. Great to dance to, buy it!"
5,Ultimate Trance,"If you enjoy trance and the emotional build-ups that trance music has to offer, then ""Lost in Time"" is the cd for you. I had the pleasure to watch Sandra Collins in Chicago spin at one of the most popular night clubs in the nation and the music she played was unbelieveable, similar to the Cd she produced. I recommend it to those who totally appreciate and understand the style of trance."
5,Amazing book,"This is one of the greatest books I've ever read. I love time travel stories, and also there aren't a whole lot of dinosaur novels for people over the age of ten. So this was really great. And you really came to care about the characters, and truly wish for them to have a happy ending. After I read this book, I went looking for more books by this author, and was disappointed not to find any. So, I was completely delighted, when I was at the bookstore the other day, and saw that he has published a sequel. I can't wait to read it, and I hope he writes more!"
3,Predictable time travel melodrama,"Far from the worst thing I've ever read, but equally far from the best, Hubbell's novel gives the reader a pleasant couple of hours of escapism. If it does not rise much above the mass of similar genre titles, it does leave the reader with a pleasant sense of adventure and happy ending. Worth a look, but science fiction lovers will find a far better effort in Michael Swanwick's ""Bones of the Earth,"" in which the same general situation--time travel involving dinosausr--is treated far more imaginatively"
3,Lost in the Wild Sci Fi...,"Hubbell's work is a cross between science fiction/time travel and ""lost in the wild/survival"" stories. The time travel theme provides the broader framework, but the bulk of the novel is really spent on the survival in the wild theme. Generally, this novel worked fairly well. It didn't try to do too much, and the ending is only barely hinted at early in the work, and so is surprising and fairly unexpected. The characters are mostly well-developed, and the plot moves along at a reasonable pace. It was worthwhile enough that I'm likely to read Hubbell's sequel, which apparently uses the same characters and broad time travel theme."
3,"Just ok, but the price is right for the budget concious","This certainly isn't a mic you would want to enlist in a professional setting. I bought it to replace the non functioning podium mic at our church. I find that the trim has to be boosted more than necessary when compared to other podium mics I have used, resulting in reaching a point that can degrade audio quality (hollow, even after eq) and tempt feedback. Also, it is quite a bit shorter than i anticipated, even with knowing the length when purchased. But, the price was cheap, so in that regard I maybe was expecting too much in spite of the fact that it is an Audio-Technica product."
3,Alex water drum,My 2 year old was able to play with one of the drums but the other arrived cracked. She liked it but tended to turn the drum over to fill with water and play that way rather than beat the drum.
4,"Good toy, not too noisy!!",Bought this for my kids 3 and 4 yrs old who always bath together. It's good for them as there is two. They aren't noisy enough to be frustrating either.
2,Not for babies or toddlers,"I bought this for my toddler grandson as he loves his bathtime and bath toys. Since this comes with drumsticks and it is purely a safety issue, we let him play with them as ""bongo drums"" following the instructions as to how to ""burp"" them in the bathwater but used this way (without the drumsticks) they definitly were a dud! I have put them away until he is older and I feel safe with the drumsticks! Perhaps they perform better for the older child."
3,"Drums are ok, but not worth 5 stars","My children (32 months and 14 months) have had these drums for 2 months now. They were thrilled to get them, but the novelty wore off quickly. They are ok, but not worth 5 stars. They don't need drums to 'play drums' with other items - ie. banging etc. The different music tunes are really not that different."
4,Water Drums a Big Hit,"I bought these water drums for my nephew's 4th birthday. He was so excited to play with them he wanted to take a bath during his birthday party!! The drums are well made and have a nice sound in the water. They can even be used outside the tub, but the sound tones are not as good. Well crafted and a nice toy."
5,WATER DRUMS,Great purchase. I love the product. Pretty reasonable price. I received exactly what I ordered and received the product as stated.
4,media and society,"nicely written with a multi-national approach,not just usawell organized for students with good discussion questions and a summary review at end of chapters. like it alot! i am the teacher."
4,Great reference,Very well laid out and easy to use. It has info on where to stay and what to do. Other books are more complete but this one does OK. I would recommend it
3,user friendly,You can understand Enochian magick and start to use it right away. THis book takes the user by the hand and teaches how to do it. If you don't know how to do Enochigan ritual then get started right now. IF you can handle Lon's arrogants you will enjoy this book.
1,SKIP,"Potentially the most poorly-crafted baseball book ever penned, ?Barry Bonds: Baseball?s Superman? never fails to disappoint, whether it is in analyzing Bonds? extraordinary statistics to getting inside the head of this private and elusive man. At best, this is one of those [...] books you so often see when someone is thrust into the limelight.The book offers no insights that can?t be found in the small array of periodical reviews Bonds has done for publications like ESPN The Magazine (Dan Patrick?s three-page interview alone offered about the same amount of substance as can be found here) or Sports Illustrated, and the examination of Bonds? numbers certainly falls far short of the work guys like Bill James does. [...]By all means, if you want a quick, painless read that scratches your Barry Bonds itch, read up. No one will be harmed by reading this book. But if you want a quality baseball book about this legendary player, look elsewhere. You won?t find it here."
4,Travers reveals the complex man behind the Giant's star,"This inciteful book leaves the reader with many interesting stories about Barry Bonds. It is not just about Bonds, but brings in many other players and people in Bonds' life. For the person who loves baseball it will be particularly meaningful with many historical facts about the players and how they interacted with Barry Bonds.The book is an honest look at Bonds and who he is. Bonds never played up to the press. His 73 homeruns in 2001 was something that won the nations heart and as Travers said was a great distraction for the public that helped them forget 9/11."
4,Steven Travers on Barry Bonds,"I have lived overseas for many years but was an avid Giants fan in the 60's & 70's. Steven Travers' book on Barry Bonds was a welcome gift. I had read various news articles about the ""controversial"" Bonds and feel that Travers' book puts things right. I especially enjoyed the insights into the life styles of high powered sports figures. The build-up to Bonds' record setting home run season was handled in an excellent manner. This book is a great read for any baseball fan."
1,Unbalanced,"This book is designed to sell to newlyweds by encouraging their often immature desire to justify their poor behavior. The book accordingly plays to the audience, and provides no balance or a mature dialogue to find mutual accommodation. As a result it is inflammatory and encourages increased separation, and greater conflict. The title itself is inflammatory -- a form of name-calling which the author then blithely advises the reader not to do.The author really cranks out a lot of these kinds of books. I'm pretty unimpressed."
1,Inadequate,"This book is nice in theory but absolutely inadequate in one fundamental aspect. It does not address the fact that in many US states and in Canada in-laws have the legal rights to enter their childrens' house ""at anytime"", impose any ideas on their grandchildren. Without resolving this fundamental issue, the book does not offer any help to parents who decide to resist abuse from their in-laws. The book should specificaly address the advice as described in Paul Dodge: ""Visistation CD"" available from http://www.legalimaging.com/wolf/ go to 'Resources'. This site fills the biggest gap in the book."
3,Stuck With Toxic In-Laws? You're Not Alone,"Susan Forward is not a brilliant writer but the spirit of her writing is so sincere I'm inclined to forgive the lack of sparkling prose. The strength of this book is in the many stories of marriages threatened by in-laws who don't know their job is to BACK OFF. In my own experience and in my practice, I've seen a lot of different examples of toxic in-laws but it's still validating to see these stories in black and white. Sadly spouses often do need reminding that their first allegiance is to their wife/husband. That realization may need time (and relationship counsleing) to evolve, but what Susan Forward confirms is that unless and until this shift of priorities happens you're not married, you're just playing house."
3,Toxic in-laws,"This book is ok enough. I liked other books by Susan Forward better, like Toxic Parents. I didn't find the help in this book that I needed and felt it was a bit stereo type problems. Could have been more general advices included. Also I think some of what she writes about forgiveness is totally wrong. Forgiveness is not about condoning the other persons actions, but about you letting go of the resentment and anger towards this them. I believe forgiveness is an important step in the healing process. Read books by Louise L. Hay if you are interested in seeing things different and get done with the past."
4,Interfering in-laws can ruin a realtionship,"This book is very comforting and helpful if you're dealing with interfering in-laws. It clearly identifies the different types of offenders and offenses, some subtle and some overtly aggressive. The running theme of the book is to get your spouse to take your side in the situation and not create more antagonism. The author gives a variety of anecdotes to illustrate different types of abuse from in-laws and how the problems are solved. However, in my experience if you are unable to get him (or her) to defend you, there is not much hope.I liked this book, the only bad thing about this book was it's scope is limited to mothers and fathers in-law. It does not provide any remedies for interfering brothers and sisters of your spouse that can cause equal amounts of problems. Maybe the author can address these issues in a future book!"
3,No replacement for behavior therapy but..,"Boy do I have some toxic in-laws. This book starts off with all kinds of stories which is enjoyable, because you feel like you're not the only one in the world with inexplicably difficult in-laws. It then goes into some very basic strategies to make the situation better. I do think some of these could be employed & may help. Ultimately, it is a light read. I did like it, but it certainly is more of a band-aid on a gushing wound than anything else."
5,Toxic In Laws - Review,"The author's use of examples followed by categorizing the different types of toxic inlaw involvement was amazingly helpful. Not only did I learn an abundant amount of how to deal with the problems personally, I read other's stories which made me certainly feel for the first time, not alone in this!"
4,Pretty good book.,"This husband was helped by the book. My in-laws were both problem parents, and they are now problem in-laws. Reading the book gave some measure of greater objectivity, outlined the specific types of problem in-laws, recommended not being 'brought down to their level,' and ways of handling the problem behaviors. Since my spouse is not able to set limits on her parents behavior, I would have to go-it alone with them. As such, physical distance and refusing to talk with them via any means are my best strategies. Methods of severing all ties are not covered in the book, and since I've known several families that followed that approach successfully, I think the book has it's major shortcoming in not discussing isolationism or how to achieve it, short of divorce."
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"I thought this was about all types of in-laws, not just a mother and father-in-law but it is. So if you're like me and dealing with a brother and sister-in-law from Hell, this isn't for you."
5,A Night At The Pops,"As usual, Erich Kunzel does a great job at conducting the Rochester Pops even if he is more often associated with the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra."
2,"Horrible video quality, good sound",This DVD looks like someone took the VHS tape of this concert and put it on a DVD. The quality is terrible. It's very grainy and the colors are washed out.Surprisingly the sound isn't bad although the volume goes up and down unexpectedly particularly between songs.I saw TFF on this tour and it is a great show with Oleta Adams and the song selection. But stay away from this DVD unless you are a big fan.
2,Same concert?,"Is this the same concert that is in the ""Scenes from the big chair"" dvd? If it is, in that dvd the audio is excellent, in stereo and 5.1I ask that because the concert en ""secenes.."" (called ""Going to California"") is a live performance in Sta Barbara (County Bowl, may 26/1990) and includes all this tracks an some other more."
5,One of the brst TFF concert,"If you are an avid TFF fan or just want to get to know them, you should try watching this concert. One of the best TFF concert i have ever seen! Long live Tears for Fears!"
5,They're smarter than you think!,"This is a wonderful book. Having had companion animals all my life, I've never had any doubt whatsoever that our four-legged and/or feathered friends have a lot more going on in their little heads than some people give them credit for. Just because an animal can't use human words doesn't mean they can't think, feel, or communicate; and this book demonstrates that very well. My only ""complaint,"" such as it is, is that there was no reference whatsoever to a parrot's lament. This rather disappointed me since I have a companion parrot, have read a lot about parrots, and was interested to hear Mr. Linden's story about a lamenting bird. Other than that, it's a great book!"
5,Among the 10 most enjoyable books I have ever read.,"A series of riveting anecdotes about animals evidencing unusual intelligence,behavior or resourcefulness in a most captivating prose style. The stories make you wonder if animals are anywhere as ""dumb"" as they are suppposed to be."
3,"half science, half ancedote","Lovely prose for anyone not familiar with the study of animal cognition. The ancedotes were charming and heart warming, but the author lacks a bit of depth when discussing their implications. Great tirade at the end about saving the world from human distruction. Great read for those looking for entertainment with a bit of education."
1,disappointed,"This was a used book, but it wasn't in as good condition as the seller said it was, which was disappointing because i was giving it as a gift."
5,A thoroughly delightful book,I happened to hear the author of this wonderful book on NPR and ordered it immediately based on the totally amazing story he told about the leopard that is pictured on the book jacket. What a great find! These animal stories are thoroughly entertaining and enlightening about animal behavior. I'll never look at my pet cat the same again!
1,"Ponderous, derivative, excruciatingly non-funny","Ouch, where do I start? He gives some great stories, which is why I slogged through to the end. Almost all of the stories are from the work of other people. Admittedly he has done the work of gathering the stories together, but many of them I had already read in another similar book.This writer gives us ponderous psuedo-scientific statements with a straight face. Even worse are his attempts a humor. He instructs us that certain things he is telling us are ""hilarious"". Not so.If you are *very* interested in the subject you may find it worth your time to read this book. On second thought, I *am* very interested and wish I'd done something else with the time. Reading the book, Nonzero proved to be the perfect antidote. It is truly intelligent and extremely funny. What a relief after this turgid book!"
2,VERY LITTLE Information on Observatories Here!,"Do NOT buy this book if you're looking for a lot of ideas on how to build an observatory. The book is more than 230 pages long and only 12 of those pages involves observatory building of any kind. Those 12 pages are fairly well packed with information, but the vast majority of the book covers building and using a TELESCOPE, not an observatory. Very few people bother with that anymore; as a previous reviewer stated, the quality of commercial optics and mounts has vastly improved and the prices have come down and there is simply no reason to do it.The book wasn't a total waste of time but I have had very little reason to read it over the last 20 years. Because of that, my copy is going to be donated to our astronomy club library."
2,Title completely misleading,"After sending it to my boyfriend as a care package, which he loved by the way, and he got numerous compliments on "" the gift he got from his girlfriend"". Then receiving an email from him saying that the chain left a green ring around his neck when he swam with it in a lake, I am pretty sure they exaggerated the quality of this thing. I gave it two stars instead of one since Im assuming that the ""gold over silver"" is probably for the pendant only which is apparently beautiful, but I still feel like they should be more specific about their product. If they were I could have easily avoided such embarrasment by just buying a separate chain. Not a good deal!"
4,Not bad,"It is a really nice piece. The item shipped quickly and it was exactly what I ordered. It was surprisingly small.. but because it is nearly pure silver, it was flexible enough to have been 'reshaped' mildly to fit her wrist. She wears it and is happy with my selection."
5,EXTRAORDINARY!,"This is the perfect book for intermittent reading - in your comfort room, for example! I laughed and laughed! That night, just thinking about some of the entries, I laughed some more!"
5,A must have handbook book for your health,"Stress, Diet, toxins, Mis information These are some of the most abrupt factors that attack our bodies. This book is a how to, and more so, a why to handbook for improving your health. This book is concise and gets right to the core of the problem we face in living with adrenal burnout!"
2,Not what I thought it would be,"very disappointed in the book. Each chapter seemed to say the same thing as the chapter before. Also, the book was promoted as being new, when received there were highlighted areas."
4,Back to The Commonsense Basics,"This was an easy read and being burned out I thought I wouldn't want to read anything at all, but since this book described my condition to a t, it was easy.Most of the solutions in this book are very commonsense and provide a way to examine your life and what has caused your burnout. It is a solid reminder that the foods we eat, how much we sleep, and what we do on a daily basis needs to be in line with our natural body rhythms and our natural sense of self. If you feel burned out or depressed, you should read this book, it will help you identify solutions."
5,THIS BOOK IS TRULY MAGNIFICENT. SIMPLE AS THAT.,"I don't need to write a review, if you don't want to buy this book then fine. I don't care, but I assure you it will benefit you greatly. The choice is yours."
3,3.5 stars - Well done.,"One thing I like, and which makes Siegel's books stand out for the normal legal thriller, is now little time is spent in the courtroom. Siegel, a practicing attorney himself, focuses on the characters involved and the investigation prior to the case going to court. And, living across the Bay from San Francisco, I always appreciate his very accurate descriptions of the City. While not terribly suspenseful, this is a very well done, enjoyable series and one I continue to follow and recommend."
2,loss of interest,Unbelieveable drop after two great novels: *Special Circumstances* and *Incriminating Evidence.* No courtroom battle. and how romantic can the romance with the ex really be?
3,mystery soap opera,conventional mystery with different ending. Problem is with the character development.The soap opera parts take a lot of the space in the story.
3,criminal intent,Very easy reading but not that gripping. I was able to figure out who did it a long time before the end.
3,Gratuity,"It moves along well enough but there is no subtlety in the drama that reveals that the main character is still in love with his ex-wife. The other characters do not seem fully realized. At the same time, I was left wondering why on earth the main character was given a past as a priest. I bought this novel hoping for some courtroom action and he blew it. I decided in the end not to buy any more Mike Daley mysteries, and when the opportunity to review it came up with Amazon I spent a few minutes trying to remember what on earth it was about."
4,Criminal Intent,"First time I have read this author and I would definitely read another of his novels. Enjoyed the characters, action and suspense."
5,Great book value at only 99 cents!,"This Mike Daley series is a great read, and a real bargain in kindle books for only 99 cents. Especially when you consider shipping cost involved to receive a paper copy!"
3,it's ok.,The plot sounded very familiar. Characters are kinda believeable. I did like his style of writing. May need to read more of his works
5,Sheldon strikes gold again!,"What can I say? This guy gives hours of pleasure. Mike and Rosie are two of the best on-going characters around. The only problem is we have to wait a year to meet them again. As ususal, Sheldon Siegel has given us another winner. I must add, it's refreshing to be able to grin and smile with a main character even when he's chasing such dastardly perps. As Sheldon Siegel has shown, a sense of humor can go a long way. Kudos to you Sheldon...get back to the keyboard...we're all out here waiting for the next adventures of Mike & Rosie."
2,Tired of the formula,I've read several books in this series and I am tired of the formula ofSPOILER ALERT!!!!the lying client whose story can be seen through a mile away.
3,Criminal Intent,Very good good Three Star.Three StarVery good. I enjoyed this book very much.Read it to see if you like it too.
2,Decline in Quality,This is really a weak book. The characters have become uninteresting and the story line is just silly. We're watching the decline of a good writer.
5,The one and only,"Mayo is a gift from the gods. Product is great, but I failed to register the size properly so it was not as good a deal as I had calculated. My bad."
4,Is it over?,I started reading this series when I was about 13. I am glad that the series ended before I out grew it. This book is another Survivalist classic although not on par with some of Ahern's earlier work on the series. If you can find a copy read John Rourke's final adventure as he leaves the hospital with after recovering from near fatal wounds to do battle with his arch-nemesis Deitrich Zimmer over control of the last nuclera aresenal left on the planet. The fate of earth hangs in the balance!
4,South of Main Street,"Recently finished ""South of Main Street"". I only read at night for pleasure and often went to bed early just so I could see what Henry would do next! My favorite character was Judge Brady. The unexpected twist of him being compassionate and caring, someone who looks for the best in people, was admirable and unusual. In most stories, the judge is the ""bad guy"". I especially appreciated Dixie's Mom, who endured to the end and loved Dixie most by not making her choices for her. Tough stuff. Keep on writing!"
1,looks good,This grinder has a blade thats to big for it makes it impossible to crank. The parts are not machined well. There is metal burs all in the grind plates that u would have to sand off unless you like metal burs in ur meat and the grinder flakes. I trashed this junk dont waste ur money.
1,Bad bad bad,"I got this grinder as a present, so I didn't get to inspect it beforehand. The quality is awful - parts don't fit together well. I cut my finger on a sharp edge of a grid plate. The blade on the other had is completely dull. Meat gets stuck inside the machine and doesn't come out. And the blades and plates got immediately rusted after a single washing. This product is a disaster!"
2,""" Don't make them like they used to""","Poorly made, tolerances between moving parts much too wide resulting in two ounces or so of whatever you happen to be grinding not making it through the unit at the end of the process. This obviously wastes a lot of food, and likewise makes for a messy cleanup. Wish I still had Mom's old grinder 50 years old but still worked like a charm."
4,Great book!,"There are two types of scrapbooking -- the ""cutesy"" kind that emphasizes photographs with all sorts of stuff to paste in. Then there are classic scrapbooks that incorporate memories, ticket stubs, photos, paper memorabilia, pressed flowers, etc. This book is the latter. If you're really into teddy bears and angels and ""fun"" stickers, you'll hate this.If you are an artist who despises cute and would prefer to read the pages of Somerset Studio rather than Memory Makers, buy this book -- it's really worth it."
4,A Terrific Debut!,"I highly recommend this fast paced, entertaining book of instrigue and suspense! Can't wait for more by this great new author!"
5,one touch of venus,a prime example of romantic comedy of the past. Where is DVD???? I should know I lived it. I worked in hollywood for 11 years.
1,Product Useless,"I purchased from a ""private"" textbook seller.The product was ""useless"". I contacted the seller and couldnot resolve the issue.I no longer have confidence in this type of transaction.I should be able to return this item like any other item.It should not be ""at the seller's discretion""I will not shop on Amazon.com again!"
2,Need more examples -- rely on website?,"As a student I found this book's transaction examples to be somewhat limited. For instance, in the existing-foreign-currency-transaction hedge examples, both cash-flow and fair-value, only A/R adjustments are treated, there are no *buy side* transactions with A/P illustrated. There are also a lot of minor errors that are distracting."
3,It's an OK book if you have a good professor,"I used this textbook for two of my accounting courses (Advanced Accounting and Governmental Accounting). In both classes, we experienced numerous errors within the solutions. Some chapters are easier than others and others are just horribly constructed. In the governmental section of the text, examples are difficult to follow which makes answering exercises and problems that much more difficult to solve. Bottom line, your professor makes all the difference; if they know what they are doing, it makes learning it easier."
3,solution for the excercises,"it is a very good book actually, but i'm having some difficulties in solving the exercise, so i think this book need a complementary book or some kind of manual or solution. But if there is, I would like to be informed about where i can get that kind of book. Thank U!"
4,Great flavor,"This purchase was a gift, but I did get a taste of the finished product and it was very good."
4,Good starter,"If you have never made sausage before, this kit will get you started. The spices did a good job of flavoring my very first batch."
3,Could be better but worth buying,There was much to read as to labels and ingredients of this sausage kit. We were disappointed to find MSG in the Italian sausage mix or else this would have received five stars. Before buying this product I read all I could find on what was in these packages without success. The casings and the instructions for the casings were easy to understand. They were easy to install on the sausage tube of the grinder. But the Italian sausage mix has MSG.
1,Contains corn syrup.,"I'm just getting into making my own sausage, and bought this kit to try breakfast links. However, it contains corn syrup solids. Corn syrup is one of the many terrible things I've removed from my diet and will never add back. Returning it immediately. I'll buy casings on their own and try a recipe from scratch."
2,Not Good at all,I ordered this and it came in a timely manner but when I opened it all the spices were hard as a rock like it was real old and the hog casing did not do well as they burdt very easily and also had many holes in them. I bought a High Mountain sausage making kit from a local sporting goods store and it was 100% better and tasted much better as well. Was not a happy camper with the results of this sausage making kit and will never purchase this brand again
3,All is good,"All mixes were good but the Italian sweet mix was the best, and I wish I can buy this without the kit, we loved as Patty no casing and without the other Spices"
2,Not the original trios,"This recording is NOT by either the ""Guard"" Trio or the ""Stewert"" Trio. It was recorded after the Trio lost everyone but Bob Shane."
5,A Must Read,"This book is critical reading for executives. It offers clear direction on ways to invest in internal systems and structures to maximize contributions from people at every level. This book can help organizations develop a philosophy that supports all employees' capacity to contribute to build productivity and solidify sustainable growth. It is not a self-help book with a quick fix; it's an epert resource. Savage explains the importance of unlocking our hidden potential and offers ways to establish a process where we can develop, sustain high performance, and achieve personal satisfaction."
5,Great tea for IBS sufferers,I have severe IBS along with acid reflux and a number of other ailments and this tea is the only thing that calms my stomach and actually tastes good. To sweeten it up a bit I put in a teaspoon of organic honey. Highly recommend to anyone with IBS or just for upset stomachs.
5,Works better than anything else for me!,"This tea is the best thing I have ever found for 'tummy troubles'. Even when I can't keep anything else down I can almost always keep this down. I have also found it soothing for empty tummies when trying to fast for health or spiritual reasons. The taste is subjective...I love it, but have found a few others who don't care for it."
5,Originally: GRAMMA's Tummy Mint / SUBSCRIBE & SAVE,"This tea from Celestial Seasonings was named GRAMMA'S TUMMY MINT for years. I always used it for my children for a treat, so it's a good memory for our family.Turns out the ingredients are far more than delicious, so we now use it as a tonic as well. We prefer natural remedies to drugs and this tea fills the bill nicely -- to promote wellness.I use so much for our family of six that I subscribe and save here on Amazon. (May unfortunately no longer be available.) It's a great offer - no shipping cost - discount on the product - easy to manage and change (or cancel).This has really worked out well for me, and I highly recommend it."
4,Did you see the Movie?,"If you saw the movie of the same title, and wondered how much of this is really true, and how much was manipulated for the screen, this is the book for you.I enjoyed Mr. Starkley's writing style and felt it moved quickly, with only a few exceptions.My biggest compliant is that Mr. Starkley assumes the reader's knowledge of England's geography, English history and nobility. As an American my knowledge was found lacking in some areas. However, this had little effect on my enjoyment of the book. I would recommend this book to any history buff."
4,"Elizabeth- Close, but still a stretch","I found this in a bookstore and clung to it. I had spent all of my money in the last store we had visited that morning, and refused to let go of it until my cousin agreed to buy it for me for Christmas. When I read it, however, I was disappointed. It was very preliminary, and Starkey stretched the truth more than a little. Anne Boleyn had raven hair, not dark auburn. There was little, if any, backhandedness when it came to inheriting the throne where Elizabeth was concerned. Being a blood relative of Katherine Howard, Anne Boleyn, and her daughter, Elizabeth, I can't help but want the little details correct."
5,The Young Elizabeth,David Starkey as an author was recommended to me by an English friend and he did not disappoint me in this book. As promised he reviews Elizabeth I's life prior to ascension to the English throne and continues into just the very beginning of her reign. He adds enough of his own interpretation to clarify events and includes explanations of previous thought surrounding Elizabeth. I found the book to be very well written; it held my attention throughout; and I learned a great deal about why Elizabeth became the person/ruler she was.
2,"Elizabeth ""light""","A chatty, gossipy book -- but hard to accept as a serious history of the woman or the age. Starkey may be a decent historian but he's not much of a politician and Elizabeth was, above all, a consummate politician from her teen years onward. He either ignores (which would be sort of condescending to his audience) or fails to understand the deeper complexities of the political calculations that ruled her every action. More disconcerting, Starkey seems to impose modern sensibilities into the narrative.Allison Plowden's ""Young Elizabeth: The First Twenty-Five Years,"" first published in the 1970's(?) as the first of a four-volume history of the Queen, is not only vastly superior historically, but is much better written. And, much much more exciting in its descriptions of people and events. If you are looking for an exciting read and a good history, don't bother with this book."
3,More like a history book than biography,"Whether it's the lack of information about Elizabeth's early years or possibly the author's intent to write a book about England royalty in general, but I didn't really get a very clear picture on what she was like as a young lady. I was expecting it to be more like a biography, but found myself reading more about the people surrounding Elizabeth than the princess herself. One thing was definite- the author was completely in love with his subject and perhaps did his best in putting together a thousand little pieces of her life into one, but it's just wasn't enough."
5,Easy to read and informative,"I couldn't put this book down. I found it very easy to read and well researched. It primarilly covers Elizabeth's early life from birth to throne.This was my first Elizabeth book. I've since bought another one by Alison Weir on Elizabeth's later life. Weir's book is also well researched, but I found that when the same event was covered in both books, I learned more from Starky's book.My interest in this period stems from reading books about the French Wars of Religion. The only fault I found with Starky's book was that it did not give sufficient coverage in my opinion to the burnings of heretics that took place during Queen Mary's reign. They were mentioned almost in passing. The burnings must have had a major impact on public opinion, especially in London and other Protestant areas."
3,"Good, solid biography","This nonfiction work chronicles Elizabeth's formative years through the beginning of her reign, and looks for clues to how her personality and thus her policies developed. It's quite well-researched, as the author attempts to ""debunk"" a lot of conventional wisdom about Elizabeth's formative years, and it's well-written, very much like a novel. Overall, an interesting and informative look at one of the most intriguing people in history."
4,Elizabeth For Beginners,"Starkey's enjoyable Elizabethan entry is neither biography nor traditional history, but rather a fast-moving narrative that turns Elizabeth's pre-coronation life into a suspenseful game of chess between the Tudor sisters and their respective faiths.Elizabeth's bumpy journey from princess to traitor to Queen is covered in a series of short, punchy chapters providing just enough period detail not to slow things down. While this account won't be mistaken for a scholarly work, it is more than just a 'greatest hits' collection on Elizabeth's rise. Starkey provides concise sketches of many of the period's best and brightest, a thorough sense of historical context, and maintains a lively sense of humor throughout.We'll forgive the author's fondness for awkward anachronism given his success in making complex events come alive, and returning some narrative to English history. While the book may give hives to the more knowledgable, it's great fun for Elizabethan beginners."
4,Elizabeth: The Struggle for the Throne,"David Starkey, in my opinion, for those interested in Royals,has written an easy-read eventful portrait of Elizabeth I and all her counterparts. From the time of her mother's (Anne Boleyn)flirt with her father Henry VIII, Mary's rise and fall and Elizabeth's life from thereon, he never leaves out any of the written historical details, while adding a touch of humanity to all the formidable characters; metaphoring their situations along the way. He has dug deep for the writing of this wonderful easy, readable story depicting Elizabeth's struggle for the throne."
5,An Exceptional Book,"If you have ever wondered about one of the most successful rulers, Queen Elizabeth I, you should read this book. ""The Struggle for the Throne""chronicles the life of Elizabeth from her birth in 1533 until her coronation in 1559.Starkey does a wonderful job of recreating the whole political and religious atmosphere of 16th century England. Most of the book is based on the fight between Protestants and Catholics in England during this time; which was the main influence in Elizabeth's struggle for the throne.Starkey really brings out the most fascinating, dangerous and overlooked part of this fascinating woman's life. The years that formed her personality were these. The book is a quick read that reads more like a novel than an indepth political study. This brings out the drama of the story out more vividly in your head. I would recommond this book to anyone interested in Queen Elizabeth I."
5,enjoyable,"This is a nice introduction to Elizabeth. It is easy to read, moves along nicely, interesting and enjoyable to read. Nice color plates, as well."
5,Coolmax 400,Just as ordered super fast shipping. It was exactly as I ordered. Only issue which is my fault my motherboard is bad not the power supply.
4,so far so good,"this coolmax 400w psu I ordered seem to work okay on my custom-made desktop computer. though when I tested this psu on my friend's computer, it almost powered up all the parts except for one of the DVD drives there.in short, this power supply box might be good to use as long as you don't put a lot of stress on it."
5,Great Power supply,Purchased through Amazon.com The power supply was Smaller than original but still compatible to the tower box and screw holes.It was lighter and went in no problems.It been 3 weeks and no complaints.
2,Power Supply Doesn't Work,Coolmax 14616 V-400 ATX Power Supply (Purchased on 11/19/2009)by Global Marketing Partners fails to function following installation - I will have to order another one from a different vendor.
2,Loud!,"This product powers my green gaming machine, but if you want something quiet this is not the psu for you. I thought that the people who said it was loud were just sensitive, but this thing is louder than my CPU cooler, side fans, and exhaust fan put together. It is a little quieter when it is hot. I will never cheap out on another psu ever. Also I would reccomend anyone looking for a psu to look for one that is 80% efficiency or above to lower noise."
4,ATX Power Supply,"I installed it as soon as i received it and it has been working flawlessly ever since. It is a little more noisy than I like, but tolerable."
3,DOA,"A cheaper COOLMAX psu I ordered showed up DOA, this one did not. 3 stars because its a psu from a cheap company. YOU SHOULD KNOW WHAT LEVEL OF QUALITY TO EXPECT FROM A 20 DOLLAR PSU."
5,Great Power Supply!,This power supply was the right price and an excellent product. Easy to install and provided all the power my system needs.
5,Coolmax 400W Power Supply,"I used this supply to replace one that failed. I had seen a lot of reviews that said it was loud - this one is a lot more quiet than the one it replaced. It has an 80mm fan so it is louder than one with a 120mm fan, but quiet for an 80mm fan. The reviews also said the cables were short - I had no problem with that either. As soon as I installed it, it just worked perfectly, I'm very pleased with it!"
5,VERY PLEASED,"I've had it installed for about 6 months now, and no problems. It really isnt all that loud. At least I know its moving some air. Would definately buy another for a medium power build or replacement."
4,Coolmax 14616 V-400 ATX Power Supply,"This product arrived well within the shipping window from the supplier. After installation, it worked as expected. I hope to get many years of use from it."
1,Plainly -failed in three days,"After installation, this power supply worked for about 3 days. Then stopped powering up. (I've put together several computers in the psat, I am no newbie at it!)Took the computer back to Best Buy, where purchased. They put in another power supply. The computer has been working ever since. Since I went out of town in the mean-time, I was surprised to see Amazon would no longer accept the return, as it had been over thirty days. Oh, yes, they said I might get a partial refund! No, thanks!"
2,NOISY LOUD and OBNOXIOUS,"Power supply works fine, but it runs fast all the time and is quite noisy. I'd send it back, but I threw the box out without thinking about it.When I searched the internet for this product and fan noise, I find I'm not alone in my disdain."
3,Loud,Just used this power supply in a build a did for a friend. Hasn't had any stability issues but it is really loud. I considered returning it but my friend needed the computer quickly so it was kept of necessity. There are other budget power supplies out there that are much quieter than this one.
2,Used for a cheap build,This power supply is a good basic power supply but it is loud. If you are going to use it for a cheap build this may be fine but that is all it is good for. I will be replacing it later on. You get what you pay for.
3,Decent power supply,"For the price this is a decent power supply. I have seen similar models at local stores for twice the cost. The fan is a little noisy, but that should be expected at this price point."
4,"""fabulous""",this item is great i use it alot when friends come over and such. i rate this item very high for its remarkable quality.
5,Discover the white marlin - no fishing interest required,"A delightfully narrated story by a South American born raconteur who is also an award winning restaurateur in Washington DC. Carlos takes you on a page turning journey through his thoughts and inspiration deep sea-fishing off the eastern Atlantic shores. The highlight is his participation and triumph in the annual white marlin fishing tournament in Ocean City, Maryland. Carlos is a gentle spirit with herculean courage. After reading this, I feel I have to go meet him as well as his new restaurant, the Fathom Grille in Ocean City.This is a very quick and uplifting read. It reminds one we are only limited by our perception of what is possible."
3,"Great tea, orblem with quanity","I ordered six boxes (20 bags per box) of this wonderful tea. Delivery was prompt, but it came as 10 boxes of 10 bags. I went online and followed return instructions. Again the order was filled promptly, but also again it came as 10 boxes of 10 bags. Both boxes came with a sticker and a bar code on it saying ""Celestial SeasoningdsThroat Soothers, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of six). The box, however, is clearly printed 10/10 Throat Soothers.I spoke with a very nice customer service rep to try and get this straightened out. He will refund my money, but I'd rather have the six boxes of 20 tea bags."
5,This book is a keeper,Hilarious. Brilliantly written. You will read it in one sitting and laugh out loud. This book is a keeper.
5,Just as advertised,"The book was in excellent condition, just as advertised. It was priced very reasonably and was an excellent buy. I was very pleased."
5,Classroom Assesssment Review,Excellent book! Angelo was very clear and concise in guiding teachers through the assessment process.
5,The name couldn't be better!!,"I buy lots of needlework magazines, including quilting, and this is the absolute #1 magazine I have ever read. In fact I just bought about 30 back issues.I can't wait for the next issue to arrive. The projects are beautiful, and do-able. I think any one could do them from novice to experienced. Even the advertising is great. I love to get on the internet and surf through the sites of the advertisers.I can't think of a single negative thing about this magazine except I wish it came more often!! If you subscribe you won't be disappointed."
4,Lupica is getting better,"Lupica will never be considered a great writer of fiction, but this novel is a huge step in the right direction. This novel has a pretty good story and a couple of well-developed characters. Unlike his two basketball novels (Jump and Full Court Press), this novel kept me reading because I actually wanted to see how it would turn out.I have a few problems with Lupica's writing in general. He tends to use the same type of characters in every book, it is impossible to get through 50 pages without ending up in a strip club, and every 20 pages guarantees a bar scene.Having said that, I did enjoy the story in this one. It helps that I love baseball and suffer as all Red Sox fans do. I have to give credit to Lupica for giving us one great season even if the Red Sox have yet to match it."
1,I fell for Lupica again. When will I learn?,"A few years ago I bought ""Bump and Run"" mainly because it came highly recommended; particulary by Don Imus. As I struggled through it, I kept waiting for the laughs, which never came, not even a smile. I find it hard to believe, but ""Wild Pitch"" is even worse!! A book this size is usually a two stitting read for me, but it took me over a week to finish....In sum, the book was boring and unfunny. The events predictable and the characters so poorly drawn that I didn't care what happened to any of them."
5,I love Lupica,"Mike Lupica has become a writer that I can't wait until his next book comes out. Now I've read ""Wild Pitch"" and I have to wait again. It takes you deep into the sport of baseball, with his real knowledge of the game, his rich characters, and his great sense of humor.It's a wonderful read. If you're a sports fan, and I am, you'll really enjoy this one."
5,good stuff,"I bought this stuff because my puppy has allergies that we havent quite figured out what they are yet. He had a rash under his armpit,so I put some salve on it and it soothed it right away. He didnt even fight me, like he usually does, so it must have made it feel better right away."
4,The Great Conversation Volume 2,The product was shipped in the time frame stated and was as described except for the writing in the pages.
3,Good read for a philosophy major,"If you are interested in digging into classical philosophy, this is a good start. Some of the earlier chapters are very dry, but it is helpful to understand who came before Socrates. If you only want to take ""intro to philosophy"" this book is not for you."
3,Good company to deal with...,In my opinion the book was not as described.Tne seller was great to deal with.He provded many options to make it right.I am very happy and would recomend them. 5 stars for customer service!!
4,Any other Aleut dictionaries out there?,"It may be a little bias to review this dictionary due to the fact the there are no other Aleut - English dictionaries out there (at least none that I know). The dictionary is great, and surprisingly up-to-date as best as I can tell. The only draw-back that I can think of is that the dictionary attempts to look at older words used in Aleut history (in other words, it lists archaic terms as well as newer terms for words) and thus it can be confusing which is which. But over all this is still a great dictionary.Available through the Alaska Native Language Center (google for it, they also have quite a bunch of other resources)."
5,Grilling : Where There's Smoke There's Flavor,It is the first book that my mom is so inspired to cook. The pictures are gorgeous and the instructions are pretty simple and easy.
4,The Four Little Children: A Likely Story,"I flew with the author in Vietnam, on SPECTRE AC-130A Gunships, 1970 - 1971. At the time my five children were all very young. This book has stories that I would have read to my children, now is being read to my youngest granddaughter. Knowing that this book is full of stories written, by a father serving far away in combat, in letters to his wife is pretty amazing. That the letter were found after so many years and compiled and published is a great story in itself. Great stories."
1,Soapy Alcohol Smell,"I first purchased this product from Amazon's website September 10, 2010 and the seller was Marden's Inc. I used to have people following me asking the name of the cologne. I was getting low and decided to purchase another bottle. This time the seller was Amazon.com LLC and it arrived today. It smells like dishwashing liquid with alcohol. The sad part...it cannot be returned."
5,"Two Thumbs Up from San Antonio, Texas","This CD contains many of the classic hits from both old and new Tejano artists. These artists have made excellent choices in the songs that are included, classics such as Los Nubes and Paloma Negra and El Gato Negro and future classics such as Para Ti and Que Me Quedo by David Lee Garza. This is a great CD for any one just getting their Tejano collection started. Take it from a native San Antonian, this is a top notch collection of Tejano Greats."
1,Misleading by seller,"The seller was a bit misleading by not saying it was a used item by a 'collectiable item'. When i go the puzzle i noticed the box was old, a few of the pieices were bended, and there was one piece missing. I returned it. I will not buy from this seller again."
1,Don't waste your money on this!,Lemon juice works better. This is as bad as Brasso. Doesn't even come close to removing tarnish or polishing brass.
5,A Delightful and Useful Little Book,"This is a surprisingly informative beginners rose book. An easy afternoon read, J.H. Nicholas' advice is for the most part still very helpful in raising roses. I have followed the recommendations on soil preparation and am very pleased with the results. Of course, many of the roses recommended are obsolete, and the chapter called ""Insects-Diseases and Their Control"" can for the most part be ignored. The pen & ink illustrations and style of writing lend an air of graciousness. I find it's size and gentle style make it a nice introduction to those who express an interest in trying roses. And for those who like Beverley Nichols, Richardson Wright, Marion Cran, and other gardener-writers of the 1930's, this little book would fit right in to your collection."
4,A Good Introduction To Security and Fire-Alarm Systems,"This book is a great starting place for someone that is completely unfamiliar with electricity and electronics, but is interested in installing their own security/fire-alarm system."
2,Won't stand up to clinical use,The plastic housing cracked after 2 uses. After 8 short shifts with minimal use it has to be replaced due to cracking.
2,A Second Rate Compilation,"I always wonder when a label decides to release a compilation what they're thinking when they decide on the content. For me if you are claiming this is the ULTIMATE collection, then in the end give me the ULTIMATE versions of the tunes. Instead, what we have here is basically a Monica Mancini release with some other interpretations of Mancini classics by other artists. I think its great that the talented daughter (lucky one of them can sing) does a few songs - in the right context that could be really heartwarming - but NINE songs? C'mon - give me the soundtrack originals. My take is: If you are going to do it - and if you have the muscle - and if you have the Mancini name you do - get the superstars to do the tracks and get the original versions. Don't take the easy route."
2,Some good stuff; alas not enough...,"Yes, there are some good numbers here...""The Pink Panther Theme,"" ""Charade,"" a couple of others. Unfortunately, most of the album is made up of bland recreations of Mancini's work. And, yes, I know, she's Mancini's daughter, but the vocals are...well...""forgettable.""The ULTIMATE Mancini is still the original LP box set of the film soundtracks..._Breakfast at Tiffany's_, _Charade_, etc. Look for the original recordings; forget this."
3,Ultimate Mancini CD Review,"Henry Mancini composed many beautiful themes for movies; however, it appears that many of his CDs contain the same themes. It would be nice to see a couple of new digital recordings of Henry Mancini's compositions--especially without vocals."
4,more of a information book then the others are,"This book is very good,but it is more of a informational book on pheasants then the others are about chickens/pigeons.Since alot of the different types of pheasants are wild or inside an enclosure type atmosphere,the photos are not all close up or take up the whole page.The one thing I would have liked is full body photos of the different range of colors of peacocks.There are some,but most are of close ups of the feathers themselves.Since they are not photos of the whole peacock it's difficult to visualize what the whole bird would like like completely covered with that feather pattern.All in all,I enjoyed the book alot and would still recommend it highly to anyone who enjoyed the other books about the different types of birds,but the ""Extra Extraordinary Chickens"" is my personal favorite."
4,"The final, and best, Chip Harrison novel","Block successfully retains the tongue-in-cheek, wise-cracking tone of the original Chip Harrison adventure (NO SCORE) while also inserting a credible, inventive whodunnit mystery. The Leo Haig character is a Nero Wolfe pastiche, a device cheerfully highlighted by the fact that Leo constantly compares himself to Wolfe. Since this book was originally published under the pseudonym Chip Harrison, Block also includes a several self-referential jokes, such as Chip's editor encouraging him to insert unlikely sex scenes into the story to help boost sales. (Chip the narrator cheerfully obliges). It's a fast, funny book that doesn't take itself too seriously."
2,Unbelieveably Boring,"I'm a Lawrence Block/Matt Scudder fan. Can't get enough of that Matt Scudder.So, I thought Block's other stuff might be just as good: not so. Hit man was a dissapointment and so was this.Lame jokes: boring story. Too many characters who are alike -- how many men can we stand? Blatantly crude gratuitous ""sex"" scene. Sad"
4,A Wonderful Companion to the Psychoanalytic Process,"I had been immersed in the psychoanalytic process for over three years when I came across this book. Having experienced, first hand, the soulful aspects of analysis, both pleasant and painful, I connected instantly to Dr. Frattaroli's accounts of his work with patients. I am convinced that the only sane and solid path to emotional well being is the long, introspective one described so eloquently in this book. If you have ever considered beginning psychoanalysis (or you are simply interested in learning more about what it means to be fully human) then I strongly recommend that you read this book."
3,stove pipe and accessories,"Product was in new condition. Delivary was expedient.Gradys doesn't offer joist shields for cathedral ceilings on Amazon.They, also, only have a 5 day return policy. This is difficult when ordering for a job that will be started 30 days after order is received. Especially when someone orders thinking the joist shield will adapt for flat or cathedral ceiling.Now I will have to adapt them to a cathedral ceiling with a trim box from my ceiling being flat.Would have been easier, for me, if another product would have been offered for the cathedral or their return policy were more flexible."
4,Just right,"This arrived quickly and was the exact size needed for the jeep. My son had a little trouble getting it to stick to the old one but with some heavy duty outdoor velcro, it's on tight. I'm not sure what he did but a corner of the mirror broke when he was trying to install it. I don't know if he did something he shouldn't have or if the mirror is just not sturdy enough but there is now a small corner missing. I think it's still a great and easy way to replace a mirror- just be careful when installing it. All in all he is happy with it."
2,Love your body positive affirmations for loving and apprecia,"I thought this would be a fantastic tool, for my to use, and all of her(Louise Hay) books are just fantastic. This however is not at all what it is represented it. She talks in the begining about about 5 minutes if that and then the rest of the tape is Kenny G like music. The affirmations they refer to are typed on the inside of the tape cover and you are suppose to say them. I was under the impression the affirmations were on the tape and you hear them being told to you. This tape was not as represented. I am not happy with the tape."
4,Best of group (IMHO),"Fans who hope for depth, variety, and intensity will be rewarded. This CD most clearly captures the feel of Trip Shakespeare, the earlier group featuring some members of Semisonic. The songs are well-crafted, engaging, and INTERESTING. From what I've heard, their following albums are far more predictable and dull--where the ""singles"" are completely formulaic, shallow bits of pap, and the intervening tracks repetative musically and uninspired lyrically. Almost every song on this album is direct, engaging, and musically challenging. You will remember each distinctly after the album, whic is rare these days."
2,so-so album from good group,"I ordered this album because I didn't know it and it was very cheep.I am a big fan of Dan Wilson. If you're not familiar with his solo CD, 'free life and live CD 'Live at the Pantages', do yourself a real favour!"
1,DONT BUY THIS ALBUM,Don't buy this album. Closing Time is the only good Semisonic song so just buy the cd single.
4,So far so good,"I bought this because I have a really small apartment, and even most of the loveseats I've looked at have been too long. I've only had it for a few days, but so far I'm enjoying it and it's suiting my needs. Hopefully it will hold up over time. As usual with Amazon, my purchase arrived much earlier than the estimated date, even with it coming from across the country. Can't beat the shipping for free either, which would be over $50 if I bought it from somewhere else. It was very easy to put together. The one I got didn't come with any 'wood slats' although it mentioned them in the instructions, but I read a review that said they broke easily anyway so I wasn't upset over it. I've had futons before so I know that with time the metal criss crossing of the frame starts to dig into the cushion and be uncomfortable, so I utilized the cardboard packaging it came in, cutting it to size and putting it under the cushion. Simple fix."
3,Smaller than expected but sturdy,"After moving to an apt, I needed an inexpensive bed for my 18 yr old son so a futon seemed to fit the bill for a small bedroom. The futon arrived early (even though it came cross country with free shipping) and was easy to put together. Since my son is not big (height or weight), he can live with the fact that the mattress is shorter than a twin. He said it was comfortable to sleep on and seems to be sturdy. We just hope that the mattress holds up over the long term."
2,Reviews are not accurate,"After reading all the positive reviews I purchased this item, nice look, great size quality was bad for the cost, sleeping on it was the worst feeling of the bars in your back, will never buy again."
3,Very cute but be sure to buy the insurance,"I bought this for my study and also as a temporary bed for visitors. My husband and I assembled it together quite easily. I love how easy it is to change from sofa to bed and back, this feature is very useful. To support the mattress, a wire slat is attached to the sofa frame, it seems sturdy enough, but you may see some of the wire-end not totally attached to the frame. This is because the spot welding to attach the wire is not well done. Based on the review of previous buyers, I purchased the insurance offered when I ordered this sofa. The 5-year replacement policy only costed me $14.99 but it gives me the option to have it replace if/when the sofa breaks down within 5 years. I would recommend this sofa to my friends only if they buy the insurance."
1,Horrible,"This futon is ridiculus. The thing doesnt even fold into a full size bed, like most futons. it just folds the sides down and wont even fit my entire body on it. Its pretty much a kids couch"
5,Wonderful Inspiration Story,This move is a must see. No matter what your belief is you will be inspired by this wonderful story. This is the type of movie that really makes you look at your own life to think about how would you react in this situation. This also won 3 major award at the worlds largest film festival including Best Documentary and The Jury Award (2nd best overall film) [...].See this movie and share the story with friends.
5,The Heart of Texas,My husband & I saw this movie at our church. It is an excellent movie with a great message on forgiveness. We couldn't wait to purchase the movie in order for our family to see it.
4,something to think about,"the dvd is all touchy and stuff and you can watch it yourself, however, one thing to think about is that is the accident really the truck driver's fault? that girl jumped into the highway herself. Most ppl I talked to think it's definitely not the driver's fault. so then how can one ""forgive"" someone who didn't do anything wrong? It's like someone commited suicide by jumping down from the roof of my house without my permission, and her parents ""forgave"" me, I would say ""what the heck are you forgiving me for? I didn't do anything wrong. you are crazy...."" but anyway, aside from disagreeing with this ""forgiveness"" I still give them credit for their good hearts....ok, you can watch the video."
2,"Rent it, don't buy it","Very lame, but what can you expect from a movie made by Dan Patrick? if you have to see it, rent it or get it from a library."
1,Same old same old,"I really, really tried to sit through it, but could not. I guess Rep. Dan Patrick thought he could just slap a movie together to show at local churches and it would bring in a few more votes. It reminds me of the new age movies that are out there: bad quality, in-your-face message but really not a movie -- more a sermon and just the same old stuff rehashed."
5,inspiring,Wonderful story. So wonderful to see forgiveness in action. Only with God's help could this be done.
2,Not what I expected,The story was great - very powerful. But I didn't expect the movie to be a series of accounts from people. I expected it to be a feature film! Instead it was interviews with numerous people.
5,Another Winner of a book by Dr. Brad Young,"As a teacher of Hebraic-Christian studies, I want to applaud Dr. Brad Young on all of his books. However, his new work ""Meet The Rabbis: Rabbinic Thought and the Teachings of Jesus"" is filled with truth that many Christian will never read because in the Church there is no one teaching Rabbinic thought. This book will become required reading for all those who come to Mayim Hayim Ministries House of Study to learn of Jesus' and his Judaica Rabbinic Biblical Roots. Oh how I wish the Church had never thought-out the baby with the bath water. Please keep writing books like this one, we need more books because the Body of Messiah is suffering from severe anorexia in this area. Todah rabbah Dr. Young for your brilliant work!"
5,Great Pans and Great Value,"Well constructed, heavy, durable...these pans provide even heat across the whole cooking area. The non-stick surface is far superior to those found on most other brands of cookware. Foods slide off with ease. Because of the aluminum construction, it is rarely necessary to turn the heat much over halfway on my electric range. I have to admit, my wife and I usually buy AllClad. At this price point, however, these pans were irresistible. When compared to AllClad, I do not believe we have given up any quality by owning these pans. We've only saved money.Note: For what it's worth, these pans are made in China, unlike the Calphalon Commercial from yesteryear. Guess that's why they are priced so low."
5,Great Product,I'm cooking at home more now than before these pans. They are great and easy to clean up.
5,I LOVE these pans,"I didn't think I'd ever see a no-stick surface frying pan that I could love. Well, this is it! Things brown nicely, the cleanup is so simple it's fantastic. My husband has been making omelettes for years on my regular Calphalon Commercial Hard Anodized pans and struggling with scrubbing the stuck residue. No more!It's important not to place these pans in the dishwasher. My son did, and the exterior of the pans reacted and turned almost white. It's a bit of a pain to wash these pans by hand, but a small price to pay for the way they perform."
1,don't buy,"what a waste of time and money. Ms. Day must live in her own little world. You can not make dreams come true. Hard work, education will get you all you are looking for out of life. Dreams.... ridiculous"
2,The Circle,The is basically a rehash of The Secret. The information may be helpful for those who havent read anything else on the subject.
5,A reminder of how our souls are connected to deep wish!,"I found The Circle to be simple, clear, and very meaningful as far as being a review of how deep wish reflects our hearts desire. I liked the manner in which she broke down the steps by which one can manifest their wishes."
2,A bit disappointing,"I am sorry but I found this book repetitive and not terribly well written. I had a difficult time finishing it. I found myself thinking if I read the words ""the circle"" one more time! Ugh!"
3,The Circle,I found The Circle by Laura Day to align with my beliefs regarding electo magnetic collective energy and positivethinking. It reminded me a bit of Creative Visualization. I followed the exercises in the book.
5,thought-provoking.... a catalyst for change,"When I knew it was time for change in my life, I began searching for ways to make those changes manifest. I needed to reconnect with my true self and find answers. This book assisted me in my process. It served as further enhancement to another book (Islands of the Soul: A Guide to Personal Truth and Happiness) that I read at about the same time. Sometimes we all need some gentle reminders as to the desires of the deepest part of ourselves."
4,"The ""AIN'T Book""?","This book is out of print, and no images exist on Amazon, but just in case someone is looking for it: I believe this is the book with A I N T in blocks on the cover. (Reference to Robert Indiana's L O V E sculpture?) This particular grammar/spelling/usage book is convenient because one can look up actual examples, e.g. looking in the W's for ""was/were"" instead of having to know that you ought to look up ""subjunctive"". Wikipedia and the Internet are great, but sooo malleable. When looking for rules, about what is really nothing more than convention, there's nothing so conventional as a 30-year-old reference book! This one isn't comprehensive, but it's easy-to-use: I turn to it first."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"If you were expecting to get the hoyles book of card games rules, you will be very disappointed with this. It is very out of date, many games are not listed at all, and the rules are insufficient or incorrect even for a simple game like Hearts.This book is published with very poor quality type, it is very difficult to read."
3,take it with a grain of salt,"i found this book entertaining, as all of these type of books would be. this is my very first dream book. i found that by itself, it is not enough to actually decipher you dreams. it is mearly symbols. i might pick up another book that will acompany this, that would explain senarios and not just icons. overall, a decent book IF another would explain the rest of the dreams. definatly just a fun book to look at and this is small....4""x4"" so perfect for you night table."
3,definitely 1001 elements described,A very full book - Each item (e.g. wheel) has a short paragraph as to what it may mean (e.g for Wheel - The prominence of a wheel may be a dynamic call to action...) Freudian and Jungian interpretations are included. After looking through the book though I pretty much decided that my dreams are my dreams and I need to just listen to myself and figure out the meaning. Some of the ideas in the books seem contrived and ultimately aren't for me. Good try on a very complex topic though.
2,Too superficial,I was expecting a more definitive book on dreams that would explain in greater detail their meanings. This book is geared more to those dreamers who are not looking for more factual explanations based on deeper understandings of the subject. It seems to be written for the younger generation looking for entertainment rather than understanding. Very disappointed in this book.(...)
5,"No grassy aftertaste, great green tea. Love, Love, Love","I really enjoy this green tea, this is my favorite green tea out of dozens that I've tried. No bitterness or grassy aftertaste. I don't have to watch the water temp and babsit how long it steeps. Perfect green tea."
2,memory issue,"I had 2 batteries before I purchased these. I know they have a memory chip, but I charged one and it didn't take a charge after the first time using it!!!! The other one is fine."
5,GREAT VALUE!,"I have a shelf full of books on Visual Basic. Many of them are over-priced thousand page monsters that simply collect dust because the information I need is too hard to find. This book is not only a great value at a reasonable price, it is also a useful reference for a beginning to intermediate level programmer. I can easily find the information I am looking for. The steps are spelled out clearly and code examples are provided as well. This book would be a worthy addition to anyones Visual Basic library. I highly recommend it."
1,Too many cooks spoiled this broth,"There is nothing ""practical"" about this VB book. It is a confusing mess. Chapter 1 starts out simple enough but suddenly chapter 2 starts dealing with extremely advanced activex controls and goes into VB jargon. Code samples are not explained well and some don't even work right. Those who already know VB will not have a problem following it but beginners will probably just close it after chapter 4 and give up on VB thinking they're just stupid or something.The book makes the mistake of throwing the entire VB kitchen sink at a beginner when all they need to know is getting acquainted with syntax, gui, and a smattering of useful common controls. There are much better books out there for the rank beginner, pass by this one even if it is in the bargain bin at your bookstore."
3,Average book,"There is no easy way in evaluating this book. One can always say the classic response, &#65533;It was all right&#65533; and just walk away.The book had much more examples to look at than in had tutorial type examples. It was fast reading. In the sample code the book teaches you the code by mixing it with other new concepts that will be explained later on. This somewhat leaves one with a funny feeling that the whole is not yet fully understood. Most of the sample applications, though sometimes very long in code, are not exactly real world applications. The book seems much easier than what it appears to be. A number of chapters, such as Activex components and data forms, cannot be done with the Learners Edition of Visual Basic thats provided in the book cd."
1,Very Disappointing,With all the publicity this book got I thought I would learn something I didn't know. Very little new in this publication and not worth reading or owning. Very disappointed.
5,"So you're sick; do you need a doctor, a lawyer or this book?","Yeah, welcome to the world of modern medical care. Depending on how good your medical plan is, or even how good your doctor is at listening to you, you may or may NOT get the care you need and are, I might add, paying for.This book helps you see to it that your health care provider (ie, HMO or medical plan) and doctor are giving you the best care possible, the care that is right for you.The idea of patients as advocates for their health is not new, but this book lists common ailments such as gall bladder, Parkinson's and gives the spin on how to get your doctor to give you the best treatment.What's really a crying shame is that when people are ill, they are not equipped to do battle with their health care provider and doctor. So make sure you have a family member read this book, in case one day you are too ill to fight for your own health care needs."
2,Supplement it with a medical handbook,"I found this book disappointing. I started by looking up breast cancer, a most common female problem. It did not appear in the list of chapters or in the index. I then checked all 27 general references under cancer. In many of the pages just the word 'cancer' appeared with no more information. I could not find any information on breast cancer.Next I tried prostate cancer but all I found was a mention of this problem at the end of the book under checkups in adult life.There is, however, a complete chapter of ten pages devoted to Lyme disease, surely not one of the major scourges of mankind.Much of this book is useful but it certainly needs to be supplemented by a good medical handbook."
3,For those who like to watch car wrecks...,"This is a summer beach read at best. The writer definitely crafts an interesting story ... if you like watching train wrecks and car chases. But as with real life voyeurism, I was sickened by the end, asking why this poor woman would let things go this far, and why did I kill a saturday night reading about it?"
2,Another part of DC Life,"I had heard about this book for months and finally decided to read it. It was gossipy, and funny but in the end it was another book. I was not impressed with it and it did not move me as I had expected it would. I find the Washington Post gossip section a better read than this."
4,Such a good book!,This book is a must read! I had a hard time putting this one down. If you like smut with a good story line this one is for u.
1,Shallow,"I suppose if I was going to muster up something positive to say about this novel it would be that it was short, and easy to read. That is where my positive feedback ends. The main character in this story is incredibly shallow and the reader spends the whole book following one bad decision after another. Her focus is always on how to something for nothing. Well, not ""nothing"" she will have sex with anyone who will throw her a bone. As one chapter ended and the next one began, I kept wishing that she would find her own self worth, but she never does. Then she is surprised when once again her world falls apart because she can't keep her legs closed.Overall, it was shallow, meaningless, and I think it is quite possible that this book killed brain cells."
1,Skip It..,"Not only is this book horribly written, but it's just plain boring. Don't waste your time or your money. There is more hype surrounding the author than there is any worthwhile substance in the book. Must miss."
1,NOT,"It's not funny, irreverent, sexy, insightful, well-written, ironic, satirical, thoughtful, captivating, interesting, suprising, rewarding, provocative, intriguing or even set in type that has an interesting story at the end."
1,What a TERRIBLE book,I feel bad I read to chapter 15. I kept thinking it would become worthwhile. Lame. Lame. Lame. Not one redeeming quality.
4,Good experience,Product came in the condition that the buyer specificed and it was 100% on time. Would definitely purchase from this buyer again.
5,A Perfect 10,"Entertaining from beginning to end. Very funny, candid and sexual. A fast paced story that holds your attention. An enjoyable read!"
3,Entertaining crap,"Although throughly entertaining, this novel (if it can be called that) was crap. I continued reading solely to find out if the main character ever learned from her mistakes and matured (she didn't). This novel came to fruition solely because someone said to this woman ""hey that would make a good story"" and rather than do the smart thing and sell the rights to her pitiful tale she attempted writing it herself. She failed miserably and I'm sorry to say that even the tale wasn't as gripping as I had hoped. If you are looking for something immature and quickly written to read while lying on the beach or sitting in traffic it's not a bad option. If you are looking for anything more then keep looking."
2,Ugh,Usually i love chick lit but this book was awful. The main character is so unlikeable. She is very slutty and does drugs. I am not a prudish person whatsoever but this book really bothered me for some reason. I do not recommend this book to anyone.
5,Loved it!,"If you think that it's supposed to be about ""nuance"" and ""subtlety"", you are totally missing the point. It's raw and real, and I wish more authors could write from this point of view, from actual experience. In that respect, this book has an exceptional sensibility."
1,"If I could give this book a -0 star rating, I would!","This is a terrible, terrible, book, about a terrible, terrible person. I read all sorts of books and don't expect everyone to have my same morals, but I don't think this author has any concept of what morals even are. I kept on thinking that in the end she would learn a lesson and become a better person, but no, didn't happen. I only continued to listen (I had the audiobook) with that hope.Run the other way, don't bother with this book!"
2,Disappointment,"Hoped this might be West Wing meets Sex & the City for some fresh fun. But there's little fun or insight on intern life in the capital. Just a 2nd rate ""romance"" spiced up with some pretty tepid sex junk. How this rated an embossed cover is beyond me when it never have should have seen printer's ink. Author/interns -- DC is wide open for the ""bridget jones"" or ""nanny diaries"" entry to political chick lit."
2,Trashy,It's about what I expected after reading the article in the Washington Post several years ago. I wouldn't waste your money on this book. I can forgive anything if it's well written - this isn't.
4,Not a Trashy Novel,"I resisted the urge to buy this book for a while. The Washingtonienne is not the kind of book I usually read. I am not the kind of woman who reads ""smut."" But I broke down and purchased the book. The fact that it is based on real-life experience proved irresistible.I was surprised how witty and intelligent the book is. Jessica Cutler's observations are not only astute but quotable. Example: ""Washington is Hollywood for the ugly."" There are graphic descriptions of sex and drug use, but the story is engaging even though we know what happens in the end.Reading the Washingtonienne is like catching politicians with their pants down. And there is nothing they can do about it."
1,boring and useless,This book is a boring and useless effort in self-promotion and basic prostitution. Wish I could get a refund.
1,Monkey laugh girl writes a book!,"Well, if you have to advertise your book on AAR on a show like Morning Sedition you know it is not a good book!This writer spent more time with her child like giggle laugh than actually talking about her ""book"".It is a shame she thinks that computers at work are principally for personal use. The book? Just free read the first 20 pages at the book store and then put it back and shop for a REAL book."
5,Better than most,"Much to my surprise, I enjoyed reading this book. The author tells her story in a very direct and humorous way, and the plot moves along fairly quickly. You really do not want to stop reading it, especially if you know about the impending disaster that awaits the anti-heroinne of the novel.Really, the most interesting aspect of the book was that it read like a ""how to"" on getting caught in a scandal. I found this side of the story fascinating, and so would anyone who has ever wondered what it might be like to get famous. It is actually scary how fast it happens in this book, and the author writes about it in a candid and telling way."
2,Pass the political mayo,"Predictable self-indulgent blather that is as unsexy as it is unimaginatively written. No subtlety. No nuance. No intrigue. Just the mindlessly dull meanderings of an arrested post-pubescent. Occasionally funny, though never when intended."
1,Wow.,"This is awful. I mean really terrible. Sure, it's poorly written and in desperate need of a copy editor, but what really stymies me is how a novel with this much sex could be so unutterably dull. The main character is vapid and shallow, and the plot is nonexistent. In any case, I'd agree with a previous reviewer - Washington chick lit is still up for the taking, because this has made no impact on the genre."
1,man oh man this is awful.............,"ok, whoever told this woman to turn her blog into a book is nuts!! i closed the book before finishing it 'cause i couldn't keep on reading this book was so badly written and tacky... and i read literary porn, and that's better written than this!! who wants to read about a trashy prostitute? not me!!"
3,Worth the read ...,"Thought this book was pretty funny but in the end it left me with a bad feeling in my stomach. Jackie may not have learned too much from her mistakes but I learned that people are capable of anything. I have friends who live a similar (but not as dishonorable)life as this chick and I can only imagine the stories I am not hearing about!!I finished the book in a few hours and it was trashy, funny, and all around entertaining. If you can take trash talk or hearing about some horific sexual acts then stay away from this book but if you have an open mind and can laugh at other peoples insane stories ... get it ... it's entertaining!!"
1,DO Not Buy This Book!,This book is so bad that I threw it in the garbage half way through reading it...din't even give it to anyone else...threw it in the garbage where it belonged. Wondering why Vanity Fair would say this book is worth the read.
1,Blah Blah Blah,"I am a huge fan of the I-got-fired-and-now-I-am-going-to-tell-it-all fiction, but this novel was just horrible. The writing...oh the writing. It was dreadful. The characters were whiny and irritating. Personally, I started to root against them because I disliked them so. If you are looking for something like ""The Nanny Diaries"" or ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" this is definitely not the book for you."
2,Guilty pleasure that doesn't deliver,"Sure, it's fun to get a peek into someone else's life--especially when that person does and says things that you would never do.But I never once found myself liking any ""character"" (let's face it, if you know anything about the story behind it, you realize that this is not really a novel) in this book.I was sad to realize that I just didn't care what happened to the main character or the people she scandalized. They all deserved what they got.It was a quick, interesting read, but it left me feeling empty."
1,Unbelievably dumb,"I live and work in Washington, DC and thought this book would be interesting, since I live here. I was so wrong - I only got two chapters in it before I stopped reading. Instead of viewing the main character as a strong woman, I viewed her as a female, who lacks self confidence and has no sense of self. The main character reminded me of a female that wouldn't divorce her husband, even if he had affairs, beat her, stole all her money and leave her for broke. I really was offended for all females who are hard working in this city. These are the women that should be writing fictional autobiographies of their lives. Much more interesting, then who you slept with and how much they paid you for the act."
5,A must for anyone who wants to learn cake decorating,"This book contains a comprehensive look at what each cake tip will do with a picture of what the tip looks like and what the icing will look like. It is organized by tip number. I'll be honest, I'm not sure if these numbers are universal between the different tip manufacturers, but it's easy to figure out by looking at the tips. The back even gives some design ideas based upon using multiple tips. Someone with a set of tips and enough icing could easily teach themselves to decorate with buttercream by using this book. Plus, it's a nice size for laying out on a table and looking at it while working. It doesn't take up too much space."
5,Another great Magee book,I was very happy to read this with my four-year old son. It's funny enough to read on a daily basis without losing your mind.
5,A Camping Spree with Mr. Magee By Chris Van Dusen,"My two boys love all of Chris Van Dusen's books and when I saw ""A Camping Spree with Mr. Magee"" I had to get it in time to take with us on our trip to The Grand Canyon and a few other national parks out west. The boys were thrilled to hear the new tale and the price for the book was unbeatable."
4,Nice book,"This is a good book and well written. It has a nice story and good rhyming. The pictures are also colorful and add to the story line. I'm not sure we'll be buying more of Mr. Magee though (we like the book, but don't love it)."
3,great stories but,Fun stories but the print is too small for use on the Kindle Fire. My Daughter has a difficult time reading it too. One page is almost impossible to read because the small print does not contrast enough overlay on graphics.
5,My son loved it!,My seven year old loved reading this book with his dad! Easy to read with rhyming words. I would buy another book from this author.
3,Jet 350090 6-Inch Riser Block,"There were no washers shipped with this item: the spider (the ""X"" bracket) would not fit in the riser, you have to grind it to fit-the manufacturer was aware of the problem; and there were no instructions."
5,Must reading for those who thought we could relax,"The Cold War is over, the Soviet Union, history. But a new power is rising, one that has 5 times the population of the old Soviet Union -- and a growing economy -- and territorial designs on its neighbors.China has a long and proud history. Dr. Mosher properly puts this into perspective, showing readers that, except for very recent history, China has been bigger and stronger by far than any of its Western counterparts, such as the Roman Empire. The Chinese have a keen sense of this history, as well as their recent (past 150 years) humiliations at the hands of the West and Japan.This book is a must read for all those who think that trade with China can somehow buy off the ambitions of the Chinese leadership to rebuild their empire; their hegemony over Asia and the rest of the world.China has all the potential to make the Cold War with the Soviet Empire look like a walk in the park."
2,A reference book for Studying China Threat.,It is one of the books focusing on China's threat while rising.You can find all the elements of China's existing and potential threat ot challenges.But the author's analysis based more on his assumptions.
1,The Pearl Harbor Syndrome,"After 50 years, even Israel has very friendly relations with Germany. It's also time for Americans to get over with the ""Pearl Harbor Syndrome"". In the '80s it was the Russians, then in the early '90s it was the Japanese, and now in the new millenium it is the Chinese. Who are Americans going to bash next, the Martians!? Here's a reality check. This latest China bashing book reeks of paranoia. The defense-military establishment needs a new enemy to justify bloated budgets for new toys. It should be made perfectly clear which nation threatens which nation. American nuclear aircraft carrier battle groups continually patrol the coastlines of China; not the other way around. Americans should emphasize the word ""Defense"" in Dept of Defense, and make the mission fit its name."
4,Perfect for the Nightmare Fan,"I bought this lunchbox as a gift for a fellow Nightmare fan and she loves it. The lunchbox itself is the basic aluminium style, covered with stills from the movie. I felt like one of the photos was poorly reproduced, but my friend pointed out that that particular scene from the movie is foggy, so perhaps it's intentional.The best part, by far, is the thermos. It's nothing fancy, but well made and I love the picture on the outside. My friend doesn't carry the lunchbox to work, but does carry the thermos."
3,"really cute, but...","This costume is soooo cute, but the little balls on the antenae aren't on very well. My daughter pulled one of them right off within a minute of wearing it. Any kid this age can and will do it too because they're curious about what is hanging over their head. They should've made the product more durable, especially for the price I paid. Overall, it's still worth getting though just because it's so cute. I was able to temporarily re-attatch it for some pictures of her and could probably use some glue for a more permanent fix."
2,OUT OF STOCK - PERMANENTLY,"I don't know why this item is still being displayed, but DO NOT bother trying to order this item through Amazon. I ordered 5 (five) of these at once -- and It took Amazon 20 DAYS to simply inform me that this item is ""no longer in stock"" and to check elsewhere... (ridiculous that it would take ANY company THAT LONG to inform a customer if something is in/out of stock)... SO, therefore Amazon ""Cancelled"" & ""CLOSED"" the order - without even automatically removing the item from my open orders list. (I had to cancel the item MANUALLY).SPI, the manufacturers of this item, have DISCONTINUED this particular product from their line... And the only way I found this out is because I called another company (yes, CALLED on the phone - HardwareHut-dotcom), which also offered this same product - and as I had them check the availability, they confirmed with SPI of this discontinuation."
4,Hurray for 25 years of Sonic Youth<3,"""I stole my sisters boyfriend,it was all whirlwind, heat, and flashwith in a week we killed my parentsand hit the road.""*Don't think just buy."
5,Excellent variations,"Bought this CD to replace the one that was taken from me. 007 theme at begin and end is execellent, Thunderball, like some of the others is subdued but catchy, good to relax to. Mostly good listening."
4,Noir,"The protaganist con artist/thief known as Parker gets double crossed by three of his partners. In the ensuing story he seeks revenge. As he goes across the country acquiring money for his vengence, he crosses pathes with an unknown enemy that wants him dead. A very powerful enemy. The story moves at a rapid pace with a moderate amount of suspense. Somehow, you get a certain liking for this Parker character even though he is a thief and murderer. If you can feel any compassion for Parker, then I think you'll really enjoy this novel. If not, you'll come away unsatisfied. For me it was an entertaining read.Recommend"
4,An enjoyable anti-hero.,"You have to admire Parker, the central character of Richard Stark's eponymous series. Parker is an ""honest"" robber. This time around, his colleagues on a job do him a bad turn. Left alone in the middle of nowhere, Parker plans his revenge - and proceeds to execute it brilliantly with the aid of slightly dimwitted realtor with a taste for adventure.This is a character driven story. Just a plain fun read.Jerry"
3,Everything you wanted to know about DH ( but were afraid to ask),"This book is filled with gems for fans of the show and trivia collectors, alike. MAD magazine's satire of the show is included along with key pages from the pilot script, even Susan's recipe for her ""lousy macaroni caserole"" she often burns. It is written in a production prospectus for investors format where positive mini bios are given about every member of the cast and crew. One nit pick: The actress who played Diedre in the season finale episode is left out. She was the key in solving the mystery of Mary Alice's death! Yet another actress who had only two lines in the whole show is profiled, instead."
4,A Diverse Collection,"Short stories, by their very nature, do not often lend themselves to detailed character development or complex plot. This book of short stories by David Benioff is no exception. Most of the stories provide brief glimpses into fractured pieces of lives: ""Zoanthropy"" is the story of a young man whose father, a fabled big game hunter, has come to Manhattan to dispatch one of the lions that periodically roams the city; ""De Composition"" has as its main character a man who has built a bomb shelter in his backyard and is now in residence, pending the destruction of civilization; ""When the Nines Roll Over"" concerns a rock band, its drummer, and a female singer.One story in the collection, however, ""The Devil Comes to Orekhovo"", is a stand-out. Set in Chechnya, it centers around three Russian soldiers, sent to secure a mansion thought to be an outpost for Chechen rebels. At thirty-six pages, it is the longest, and most developed, story in the collection."
5,"Funny, moving, unforgettable","Humor, empathy and a clear-eyed detachment combine with grace in Benioff's collection of remarkable stories, which carry the impact of Joyce's Dubliners and the best Chekhov pieces. To my mind, the only comparably satisfying story collection in recent years was Jhumpa Lahiri's Interpreter of Maladies. Benioff's range, as mentioned by other reviewers, truly distinguishes him from talented contemporaries. A must for any serious reader of fiction."
5,Each story is a new suprise!,"I generally do not enjoy short stories and abhor authors who write a collection of short stories after sucess with a novel. However, David Benioff's When The Nines Roll Over is an excellent collection of short stories. I couldn't put the book down and it is the only book of short stories that I own! Benioff is a master story teller who tantalizes the reader and intrigues you so that you have to finish the story in one sitting. Each story provokes some thought as well as discussion. Many authors short stories are a collection of the same themes and at times seem as though they are the run-on thoughts of the author. This is not true in When the Nines Roll Over, as all the stories vary in theme, setting and have a great diversity of characters to keep one entertained for hours. My personal favorite is The Devil Comes to Orekhovo and I still mull over it now and then! Each story is diversely entertaining and I give this work two thumbs up!!"
4,"Good, but not up to his novels","I was perhaps at a disadvantage coming to these stories after reading ""City of Thieves"" and ""The 25th Hour"", which I felt were both 5 star material. The short stories were too variable in quality. Some extraordinary, but others mediocre. I liked and would recommend the book, but felt it didn't merit five stars."
1,Out of date batteries - don't buy!,"Stay away from this seller, as the batteries I bought lasted anywhere from 0 to 2 hours! So of 60 batteries, most were dying at the most inopportune times. What a waste."
4,Batteries don't last as long as competition,"For the price $0.24 per battery you can't go wrong. They last about 3/4 the time as the high dollar name brand batteries (En****zer and Dur**ll). You can't for wrond for the price, you save a ton."
2,not long lasting,I purchased these for my husbands hearing aids. The ones he got from the hearing aid store lasted a week to 9 days. These last from 3-5 days. Not a good bargain in the long run. Will not purchase these again.
4,Good Battery,"I have used several different brands of hearing aid batteries over the last 5 years. I have been looking for the best price for comparable quality and I am sure that I have found it now. These are lasting as long as the ""top shelf"" brands and deliver approriate power at all times. I used to think that finding a battery that worked well for approximately 60 cents a piece was a great deal. That notion has been shattered with the iCellTech batteries. They work as well, for only about 25 cents a piece. I also received batteries that had an expiration of over 2 years out. If this price point remains, these will be my new batteries."
5,Batteries,"I was dubious about the life of the batteries, but tried them anyway. To my surprise they last as long as as the ones from the Audiologist at less cost."
4,hearing aid batteries,the batteries arrived in 3-5 days after the order was placed and they last as long as the store bought ones for half the price.
2,312 hearing aid batteries,We've been using these hearing aid batteries for about 2 months now and I don't think they are as good as the Walgreen 312 batteries. Some of these iCellTech barely lasted a day so I would say these batteries are not too good.Kodo
2,Not the best choice.,"Iffy quality.I have a Siemens Life HA. Some batteries last 8 days, some 3 or 4.I would not recommend them because of the inconsistent battery life. There are better choices."
2,About half were dead,About half of these batteries were dead- probably left in some warehouse for years- so a good bargain? Next time I'll spend a little more get a more reliable brand.
2,icellltech 312 hearing aid battery's,"don't waste your money! Spend an extra few $ and get a name brand, i have found these battery's last about half as long as EverReady"
4,Icelltech hearing aid batteries from Amazon,This was my second purchase of this item. I have been very well pleased both with the quality and price. I have found them to last as long as other brand name batteries. The only objection I had was the shipping price. I ordered three sets and though they were shipped in one package I was charged shipping for each set. But even with that they were cheaper than others.
4,Amazing price on the batteries,"My husband recently got hearing aids and we were surprised at the price of batteries and how often they needed to be changed. These batteries were an incredible buy. I am not sure they last as long as some other batteries, but for the price, they are definitely worth it."
4,Hearing aid batteries,I found that the batteries last as long as other brands that were over twice the price.Battery life is very important in hearing aids.
5,Great product and great price.,I have been using these batteries on my hearing aid for several months now. I find that they last just as long as the expensive ones that I used to buy. I am extremely happy that I found them on Amazon. What a wonderful deal.
5,"Fresh batteries, shipped fast!","These batteries have lasted as long as 2 other big brand batteries, but they are alot less expensive. I will be buying them again for sure.They come in a dispenser that conveniently allows you to dump them in your hand one at a time.Very nice, however, the tab on the battery that must be removed before use is smaller than the other brands I've tried. Not a problem for me, but if I was 70 or 80 years old and my fingers didn't work quite as well as they used to, this may be a problem.All in all, they are a very good battery with long life."
5,Now hear this,This product was very cost affordable and they are quite satisfactory. The product lasted approximately 6 days which seems very reasonable.
4,batteries are average,These batteries last about as long as all hearing aid batteries this size that I have bought. The price makes them 4 stars.
4,Best price,"I was a little skeptical about buying hearing aid batteries on line in an unknown-to-me brand. So far they are fine, though I think the life of this battery is slightly less than the previous brand purchased (30 vs 48 hours). However, they are far less than half the price, so they are economical. Expiration date is mid 2014, so that was good. Try them!"
5,As good as those expensive brands!,I purchased for my dad. He told me these batteries are as good as (if not better than) those big but expensive brands. Just make sure leaving the battery in the air for 3 minutes before putting in the hearing aid. My dad told me without those 3 minutes even the big brand batteries will drain out within 8 hours.In my dad's Nikon hearing aid one iCellTech cell lasts 11 days for average 10 hours use per day. Sure I will buy again.
5,Cheap Batteries,"Cheapest hearing aid batteries that I could find. They last 7 days, I turn off the aids before going to bed. When I finish them I will go back to my rechargeable batteries although they cost a little more."
1,Poor Customer satisfaction,I have always in the past used this company for my hearing aid batteries. This last shipment I received was inferior! The batteries usually last 5 to 8 days. I am luckey to get 3 or 4 days use out of these.I have tried to contact the manufacturer several time to no avail.I will not reorder from iCellTech again.
5,Pay less without sacrificing quality,"A complimentary pack of six iCellTech batteries was included with the recent purchase of my hearing aids. I bought Energizer batteries when I need replacements. When I again needed batteries, I searched the Internet for better prices. It was then that I found these iCellTech on Amazon. These batteries seem to perform as well or better than the other batteries I was using, and the 60-pack of iCellTech batteries cost me a third as much. An audible alert did report one or two batteries as dead immediately upon en-placing them. These alerts proved to be false alarms, a phenomenon that is described on the website of a different battery vendor. Simply re-inserting the same battery eliminated these false-alarms."
2,iCellTech 312 have many bad batteries,iCellTech 312 60 pack has many bad batteries. More than 20% of the batteries in the 60 cell package were DOA. Another 10% were very short lived. The balance were good enough. So I figure the price needs to be reduced by 40-50% or more to account for the bad cells and inconvenience.
1,Short life span,"I only use my hearing aids about 2 hours in the evening with the TV. I take them to church (about one hour), the occasional meeting or luncheon which would be another 2 hours probably less than once a week. These batteries are changed every few days. And half of that time they are beeping in my ear. Don't buy these."
1,Not Good,They do not last very long. I was lucky when they lasted 12 hours. Some do not work when first installed. Do not waste your money.
4,good batteries,I have been using these batteries for several months now and find that they last as long as the much more expensive batteries I was using before. Highly recommended
4,/HEARING AID BATTERIES,I RECEIVED THESE BATTERIES PROMPTLY AND THEY PERFORM AS WELL AS MORE EXPENSIVE BATTERIES . YOU CERTAINLY CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE .
2,Good Cells but Rust,Cell performs OK except if you sweat they will rust and mess up your $$$$$ hearing aids.Don't use in hot situations!
2,Watch out if you sweat,"great price, they last as long as any other brand....BUT---------They rust and messed up my hearing aid. Stick with name brandbatteries and you will be better off. Plus you will eliminatecostly hearing aid repairs."
4,Good but...,Price is just right but have noticed only lasts for 5 maybe 6 days unlike namebrand batt. But can't beat the price and you will get use to the 5 days.
2,Complete Disappointment,"I have purchased these batteries in the past and was completely satisfied. However, the batteries I received in my most recent order were ""dead upon arrival"". I would attempt to put a new battery in and it would already be dead. I am completely disappointed in the batteries. I am not sure I will purchase them in the future."
1,Almost Useless,The hearing aids I currently use are heavy on batteries. The ICell Tech batteries last from 15 minuets to a day and a half. Most of them have lasted about 10 hours. Will never buy these batteries again. Costco batteries last me about 2 days. I sent my aids in for recalibration and was informed this is the nature of my current aids.The company I bought the batteries from were OK . Prompt with the shipping and well packed
2,1/2 don't work,Sorry to say that 1/2 the batteries work and last about 6 days awhile the other half didn't. Suggestion: spend a bit more money for greater reliability.
3,Excellent for the money,"Not sure if these are older batteries than what local batteries sells on their site directly, but they are about half price vs. their site. Problem is that the life of the batterries is less than the apparently exact same batterries from their site. Not so disturbing as they are half the price and not all batterries exhibit short life cycles. I am a fan of the supplier and the batterries, and have used them for years ... just wondering what is really going on."
5,iCellTech 312 hearing aid batteries,I had been paying considerably more for considerably fewer batteries. I was skeptical about the length of time that these batteries would last or that the quality would be as good as the higher priced name brands. What I found was that the iCellTech batteries are as long lasting as the RayOVac that I had been buying and they cost about 25% as much.
4,Pretty good batteries,"I got a really good price on these batteries, so I don't mind that they only last six days instead of the seven days I was getting with another brand."
1,bad batteries,Though it apears to be a good deal only about half of them actually work. I think they were just old batteries.
1,Can't believe the positive reviews,"After reading the mostly positive reviews for this product I purchased a box of 60. Awful! Some only lasted minutes and others didn't work at all. I thought the problem could be with my aids, but after trying name brand batteries the aids worked fine. You can purchase Power One HA batteries on this site for a similar price and get a much better product."
2,Short Battery Life,I have crossover hearing aids which use up batteries quickly. A good battery will lst for about 3 days. The iCellTech batteries lasted 1 day or less. The range was from 10 minutes to about 8 hours. It was quite frustrating.
2,Many failures,"I think I gave a good review about this purchase in the past. But lately, I found many batteries about 30% of the new batteries failed immediately, or very soon after being placed in the hearing aid. It is no where near the expiration date of 2014, stated on the package. You get what you paid for."
1,Evaluation of Belkin Easy Transfer Cable.,The product does not work as easily or as well as advertised. I would not purchase it had I tried it first.
2,Weak and tasteless,"After having steeped a bag of this tea in fresh boiling water for 5 minutes or longer (I get busy and forget), and dunking it up and down several times, I started to wonder if there wasn't something wrong with the tea. The bags didn't really even have much of a smell to begin with; what scent there was didn't have much tea in it. It brewed an anemic, lazy cup that didn't stand up to the slightest amount of sugar and milk. I'm giving this 2 stars because what taste there was wasn't actually unpleasant. Colossal waste of money."
1,This book is only useful for developers but has bad explanation and wrong File numbers,This book is only useful for developers.Drawbacks:1. Code is not explained properly (Directly read the source).2. Wrong file names in many places and many errors in between (again directly read the Kame source).The IPv6 covered here is only superficial and will not subsume the requirement for indepth understanding of IPv6.
2,Sleepy and Unimaginative,"This book has a promising premise... a certain saccharine-sweet appeal to it when you look at the cover and read the first few pages.The problem, though, is that there are too many characters which are easy to confuse with one another, and too little of an attraction by the reader to the characters' story. I'm halfway into this book, and so far, it's just a blur of old people and their families, and random thoughts and odd comments made by a protagonist who's not very appealing.I just have no connection to these characters. If you have a Minnesota connection, however, and/or are not bothered by a slow pace, you might like this book."
5,Endearing Recapitulation,"This book contains spoilers to half a dozen previous Hassler novels and hence is definitely not the first Staggerford novel you will want to read. (Begin with ""Staggerford"" itself.) It unites and reunites many of the principal characters from its predecessors, most notably Agatha McGee, first seen in ""Staggerford"", and Father Healy from ""North of Hope"". Relatively little new ground is broken in this short work, but I think readers will enjoy this recapitulation and summary of perhaps the most endearing set of novels in current fiction."
5,I'll watch it every year,"I caught an episode of The Easter Experience on cable tv and I was ""hooked"". The whole thing is presented in a way I've never seen before. For example in one episode the disciples are sitting around a table after Jesus' death. Each is lost in his/her own pain. One by one they speak of their experience with Him etc. I recommend it."
3,Was somewhat liberal in altering details of biblical account,"Examples would be when Peter jumped up from table & confronted Lord about washing his feet. Scripture tells us that ""...when Jesus came to Peter, not that Peter got up from the table and came to Jesus. Other similar theatrics give occasion to wonder why different from original details given to us in the 4 gospels account of events. Most is good, but why make exceptions to the account to tell a theatrical story?"
5,Worth the money!,I was sceptical of spending so much money on a case when in the past I have had great success with cheap no name cases and PSU's. After hearing the horror stories of bad PSU's gone wild I decided to invest in Antec. This case rocks. Slick color and just the right size for my MB. The door at times of annoyance hides the ugliness of my unmatchable drive colors. After looking into studies on aluminum vs steel decided to go aluminum. For an aluminum case with pre installed window and psu on top of that you really can't ask for a better deal. All in all. Always had good service with Amazon and and have heard nothing but good things about Antec. Now I am not only sold on amazon but also ANTEC.
1,Very bad service,"I bought a Hamilton touch screen Watch last Febraury,6 months later it stopped working.The warranty service takes at least six month and nobody gave any information.I do not recommended this brand neither this watch"
5,extraordinary pigeons book,"I wanted a book so my grandson could identify his pigeons it is a great book for this ,wonderful pictures I bought extraordinary chickens for my other grandson they are wonderful books the. author is good. I would recomend these books to everybody for indenity and good reading thanks."
5,Milton - that frisky feline!,"Milton is a truly fun book for cat lovers of any age! Milton has the wonderful ability to make everyone smile, if not outright giggle. The drawings in the book are delightful and show the happy life of one special cat.I love to share Milton with friends and watch their smiles get bigger with every page!"
5,Great for any age,"I gave this book to my daughter, who happens to be 20. She has a cat named Milton,who looks exactly like Milton in the book. I mailed it to her and she was thrilled. She loved the story - it was so truthful. She has the book in a protected place because her other cat, Winnie, is very jeolous."
4,Powerful advice with real examples,This book is great because it gives concrete examples of how to succeed. A great read. Advance Mentoring www.AdvanceMentoring.com also has a Mentoring operation that allows people to find Mentors or be Mentors. Find a mentor to help plan your career. This book joined with that site will definitely help peple meet their career goals. Good luck.
5,From the Infinite to the Intimate,"Laurie Anderson's new release is a wonderful, strange, and, for her, unusually warm record. It is clear that, though she has apparently abandoned the idea of an album version of her Moby Dick show, the songs related to that show that open the album set the tone for the more personal seeming songs on the remainder of the disk. I love the way she moves the listener from the cosmic whale that shows itself only ""in parts"" to a consideration of the uncontrollable aspects of life (even when it seems like we are in control). The notion that these lyrics are ""laughable"" as compared with her early material seems quite misguided to me, as the ""ironic detatchment"" characteristic of much earlier Anderson material would not fit the overall mood of the album very well. And what's wrong with juxtaposing nursury rhymes with observations about ancient Egypt? Maybe that's just how life seems sometimes."
3,For Anderson Fans,"This is a good album, but not great! I f you like Laurie Anderson, you'll like this album...but not love it. The innovative sounds of United States (Big Science and Mr. Heartbreak) have been recycled into these new songs, good...but not memorable."
4,Solid work from Laurie,"A nice balance of her violin and singing and her usual narratives without too much of her tendency towards cutesiness/cloying storytelling or ticks. I've seen her a few times in performance and she can be both irksome and sublime. I wish she would release a version of ""End of the Moon"", which had a lot of her violin playing, which is often beautiful and mournful (as it is in ""Born, Never Asked"", off I believe ""Big Science""). There are a couple of really nice tracks here; nothing that reaches any great heights but it's a solid work overall. Underrated."
4,Narrative Prose,"Laurie Anderson's first proper cd since 1994's ""Bright Red"" continues the same half-spoken, half-sung stories she's been making since 1982's ""Big Science"". This time out the stories aren't as interesting, and the music doesn't grab you like her other efforts do. My bias in Anderson's catalogue is towards ""Strange Angels"" and ""Bright Red"". ""Life On A String"" seems somewhere between those other discs. This is not to say that this cd doesn't have its share of interesting tracks like ""Slip Away"", ""Pieces And Parts"", ""The Island Where I Come From"" and ""One White Whale"". Overall, it just felt like Laurie is sitting on the sidelines instead of being the innovator she usually is. However, any Laurie Anderson cd, including this one, is far more interesting than what's on the radio!"
4,Artists evolve,"I bought this C.D. with a little trepidation, because I was not sure what to expect. On my first listen, ""Pieces and Parts,""""One Beautiful Evening"" and ""Life on a string"" became the anchors I would play over and over again. Over the course of 3 weeks I felt I had a comfortable retention of the entire album. I wish her writing ability had evolved and improved as much as her A&R;, and choice of musicians. When I hear lines like ""I'm a little tea pot..."" and analogies like being easier to ""sail around the world in a coffee cup"" than seeing a whale ""rise up."" I feel she is bringing down the emotional depth of the songs.But if she sang other writers songs, I would not be a fan, so I give her 4 stars instead of 5 and continue to enjoy the album."
3,Disappointing but redeemed,"I'm a big fan from way back when (saw United States I-IV at BAM) and Laurie Anderson has been such a presence in my life it's a little sad to see her work decline. Her last studio effort ""Bright Red"" was brilliant. This CD seems like Laurie Anderson has nothing left to say. Weak writing, lackluster performances -- some of it seems like self-parody. The CD is redeemed by the beautiful instrumental ""Here With You."" Laurie plays electric violin and Eric Friedlander plays cello. I get the feeling that at this point in her life Laurie Anderson wants to write pretty string music. Let's hope she does more of it . This and the very beautiful package make me glad I bought it."
2,Life On A (Very Thin) String,"The ... review was dead on. As a fan, this album is a massive disappointment. Nothing coherent lyricly, nothing to capture your attention musically. Even her sense of humor seems to have dried up. Nearly a totally wasted effort."
5,Great!!!,"She shows you beauty and ugliness in its own true nest --- of hands, not eyes.And then shows you how to take care of your own hands. Literally."
2,Not satisfied with this item!,"My son loves water bombs and we've purchased them many times..He lost his shark one last yr and has been searching in stores ever since.We purchased this set for him and within hrs of using them in the pool,about 5 of them (almost half the set) were ripped at the seams and had tobe sewn together! I couldn't believe they weren't good for even 24 hrs..i'venever seen that happen before. i spent more on these than the ones you canget in the dollar store and those had never torn at the seams like that.I would not recommend these to anyone..Amazon, however, I am always happy with and enjoy purchasing from..they are my favorite website!"
5,First Rate,"Once again Ms Johnson has gotten it right. Like An Evening Gone is an absorbing story with beleivable characters that inspire an instant emotional connection to the reader. As in her previous books, she manages to make historical accuracy interesting and a real treat to read. This is an author that continues to shine. Considering her ever broadening story telling circle of recent years, the light and agility of her talent has not dimmed or declined, but rather grown with the passage of time. I'm always looking forward to her next effort... and have yet to be anything but more pleased with every new adventure."
2,"""Making Loss Matter"" falls short of expectation.","Compared to Harold Kushner's book ""When Bad Things Happen to Good People"" Or Naomi Levy's more recent book ""To Begin Again"" David Wolpe's book ""Making Loss Matter"" does not quite measure up. While he has a flair for writing, his material adds little more than what has already been said with much more heart and soul."
5,Making Loss matter,"Rabbi Wolpe put into eloquent words the inner truth that we all must inevitable face, making loss matter. The challenge is how to create special tribute and/or a memorial of this loss in our individual lives."
3,not bad,"I bought this in the bargain bin because I love Dionnes voice and wanted to hear some of her best songs. Then I saw that it was a live cd. Was dissapointed but put it on. It has good production qualities for a bargain record. For a live cd, it isn't that bad. However, there isn't any information about the concerts recorded or the date recorded. a kind of a question mark cd. but if you can get it for five or six bucks get it."
4,"Great book, but...","This is a great book about a remarkable first lady. My only complaint is that the author tries to cram almost too much info into the book. The author often will reference things that happened during Mrs Roosevelt's time, but then will not go into detail about those incidences. For instance, the author mentions that during the late 1930's, the Scottsboro incident was going on, but then she doesn't delve further into that incident. The author would've been better off not mentioning it at all.However, overall, the book does a great job of telling you the reader about the first lady."
5,Superlative biography,"I'm a big fan of history, biography, and historical fiction and have greatly enjoyed this summer's fine offerings, including the profoundly moving WWII novel, ""The Triumph and the Glory"", John Keegan's ""The First World War"", and now the great new Eleanor Roosevelt bio from Blanche Cook. Insightful, revealing of the real woman behind the public figure, this is a must-read for anyone interested in American culture and history in the 20th Century."
5,Cook has mastered the art of biography,"This book is entertaining, insightful, well researched, very credible"
3,Missing Volume 1,"Got this book now looking for Volume one, some day I will find the 1st volume and start reading the series"
5,Eleanor Roosevelt Vol. 2,"The book itself is excellent, only problem is that the book is so big it's hard to hold to read."
1,"Magellan TrafficKit does not work in Cleveland, OH","Although Cleveland, Ohio was listed as a city with traffic coverage, this TrafficKit does not provide results in Cleveland, where I live. It constantly reports 'no traffic incidents to report', even when you are stuck in traffic. PS - I took same GPS and TrafficKit to Portland, Oregon to use in a rental car on vacation. It worked there."
1,MAGELLAN TRAFFICKIT FOR ROADMATE & CROSSOVER GPS,"This did not work, I activated the traffic and went on I95 and got stuck in a 5 mile traffic backup. The radio stations all had the accident but the Traffickit was saying NO INCIDENTS ON THE ROUTE!!"
3,Cute bell but...,This is a cute bell and it has a little more color than shown. What I don't like is that there is a big screw in the center. When you zoom in on this picture you can't see it but it comes up from the bell to hold it in place. Look at the horse bell (similar to this one)up close and you can see a bit of the screw. The rooster bell had moreGoing to try to camo it so that it isn't noticeable.
1,Never been more disappointed,This cast iron piece of artistry is junk....it came in broken in 3 different pieces and I had to superglue it all together....terrible quality...wouldn't recommend it to anyone!
2,Nice yard art,"Well, I have a mixed review. It arrived broken. I had to mount it to a board and glue it then stain and varnish the board. It looks very nice mounted now. I didn't want to be troubled by the hassle of a return. Looks great now with some extra effort. Made of cast iron so it's a bit brittle."
5,culturally correct,"a book which introduces different culture and custom to children must be accurate. children's books about Japan by non-Japanese writers are not always correct as they tend to write only what they see/hear/feel and lack a broader view or facts. in that sense this book written by a Japanese author has of course no problem. the contents are well organized covering ""a year in a life"" of children in Japan. illustrations are light and cheerful. our 4 year old grandson in America who recently visited Japan enjoys this book as he can relate it to what he had seen while in Japan."
1,never delivered to now dissapointed 11 yr old.,"I ordered the ""in stock"" item 13 days ago and learned they shipped it 2 days ago. My son saved his money for 12 weeks...ALL summer and thought Niagra could deliver a quality product (we may never know) within the ""promised"" window of delivery. I try to shop locally and think this is a good lesson for my son too. Spend a few more dollars but keeps my neighbors employed and taxes to my firehouse."
3,Needs more diagrams,"I would have preferred more diagrams or illustrations of the stitches. It is hard (for me, at least) to figure out how to do some of the stitches just from text at times. I have found other books more useful.Also, the bookseller from whom I purchased the book (not Amazon) took a long time to deliver it."
3,Engaging and mildly interesting,"""Flat Lake In Winter"", a legal 'thriller' set in the Adirondack Mountains, is told through the eyes of its protagonist, Matt Fielder. Fielder is a New York defense attorney hiding out from the world in a self-constructed log cabin in the woods, when he is called to a case regarding a double homicide allegedly committed by the grandson, Jonathon Hamilton, a mentally-challenged man of 30. The narrative of this novel is aptly described by the title of the book, flat and unemotional, like a lake in winter. The details are related in an almost monotonous voice, dry and unfeeling. The storyline itself, though mildly engaging, was mostly unbelievable, right down to its anticlimactic ending."
3,Continuing Classics,"The book is beautiful as far as the actual binding and pictures. The stories are not the ones that the movies are based on, although some of the stories are based on the movie sequels. Some of the stories are too short, while a few are a little on the long side. Some of the stories are not on the main six princesses but includes other heroines. Each of the six have at least one story, some two. Buy the Princess Collection storybook first."
1,Happily Ever After,We wanted a new book - thats why we choose NEW and when my son opened this book on Christmas morning we found scribbing on the Aladin page. If I wanted a used scribbled book I would have choosen USED but I didnt- I wanted NEW and I paid the price for a NEW book. My son is autistic and that is a problem for him - he is very visual and takes excellent care of his book and he was very disappointed - not exactly what I was hoping for on Christmas morning. Very Dissappointed - not sure if I will use Amazon again!!!
2,"Great Man, Poor writing","Licklider was an incredibly influential man of the 20th century and he deserves a better written biography. Waldrop's talents are limited, and they have diminished since his earlier books (e.g., Complexity). If you are willing to put up with poor writing, check this book out to learn about a great man. Hopefully someone with better skills will take on this subject matter."
2,Who to blame?,"The author assembles many interesting (if somewhat repetitious) details about the events leading up to Bishop Von Galen's three famous sermons against the Gestapo. Curiously, she gives him very little credit for his bravery and seems to paint him close to a villain for not having done more to stem the anti-semitism of the Nazis and build a resistance movement that would bring down the Nazi government. I waited in vain to hear some mention of the courage of Jewish leaders to stand up to the Nazis on behalf of the Jews the way Von Galen did for the Catholics. Were there none to whom she could compare Von Galen? At some points in the book the author almost seems to imply that the Catholic Church was complicit with Hitler in the destruction of so many Jews. This definitely goes against historical facts. Bishop Von Galen was in no position to lift a pistol and aim it at Hitler. Nor was anybody else!"
5,middle eastern cooking,"Received my Sumac on time,in good condition. Price is reasonable,taste is wonderful!Sumac is indispensible for making Fatoush,and not always readily available at the market. Thank you! Linda"
3,ring around rosie,"Someone with an obvious love for safe and static harmonies called the participation of the Hi-Lo's on this recording ""sickening"". What rubbish!! The Hi-Lo's have been the most influential vocal group since the mid-1950's. Ask the Manhattan Transfer,Take 6,or, read Rosie's take on the group in her biography. Their performance on half of this offering adds some needed technicolor to what is ultimately a nice middle of the road recording."
4,VERY FINE ROSEMARY CLOONEY...!,"I thought this was a good album to own. I'm not a great fan of the Hi Lo's on this album and my favorite songs for the most part were not on these tracks. But other then that,it was very good and I think worth buying. I did."
1,Don't Waste Your Hard Earned Dollars on the Robo Pet,"My 7 y o son learned first hand this year that marketing a product (TV) is what sells this item. He said, ""I thought the Robo Pet would do more cool things on its own like a real dog....but it is really dumb"". If anything, he learned a good lesson about what you see on TV is not what the true reality of the product when you get it home."
5,"Wowwee, youve done it agian!","This is the ultimate pet. No messes, trainible, and fun! I dont have it, i just saw others playing with it at a store. In that store is the new Robosapien V2. V2 acually made this guy do tricks! And even better, my little brother told it to sit. It sat! I can asure endless hours of playing when he gets it for christmas. Again, GET THIS TOY! IT IS BETTER THAN A TOY!"
2,can't see,you robodog will not be you pet he will you do what you tell him to do only and will not be tot tricks you have to tell him to do it.
4,"Cool toy, But has some durability problems.","It is a really cool toy if the price is at this level, not the original WOWEE retail. It can act like a real dog although it can only show routined action. It walks well on a typical carpet floor - It is 4-legged toy!!! - So its walking ability is best among all WOWWEE robots. Only Robosapien can be equal to this toy for walking ability. Neither RR, nor RS V2(RRep) can walk better than robopet.In addition, its articulated leg structure is a fun itself! Maybe Zoids can only match with it in that viewpoint. Of course its walking motion is more realistic than zoids.Durability problem lies in the fatigue failure of the plastic grip of a spring in rear legs. This spring is needed to recover rear leg to its original position when the robopet shakes his leg for the trick #9. The problem is that its grip made of plastic is too weak. When you have played robopet for a long time, check this problem and remove the spring when its grip is broken."
4,Tons Of Fun,"I tryed this with friends and in stores it is soooooo much fun! I may have pets already but this is east to take care of no messes,no taking it out on walks,or watching after it every mintue! I love my pets so much but I really like this and I would say to any child who doesn't have a pet ""This is the one for you,it is easy and fun!""."
4,An interesting historical investigation of extinct birds,""". . . the Thing With Feathers"" is an interesting account of the events that lead up to the deaths of the remaining birds of some now-extinct species. (The author does not continually ""wax rhapsodic""--which makes many nature books so very tiresome.) Reads like a good travel essay."
5,Hope is a thing with Feathers,"Finally the whole story has been told! Cokinos' writing is superb, you will feel as though you are standing right there along side him in his quest for the complete story. I was unable to put the book down once I began. This book is a must for all bird lovers and historians alike. A heartfelt thank you for writing it."
5,Wars Within,"This is a real page-turner, not just for its great narrative drive but also as a real education in all sorts of things, from morality to institutional politics to the poetics of journalisticwriting--smart, insightful and well written."
2,"Well meaning, but ....","I've read the Lahaye-Jenkins book and I'm sure the authors are well meaning. But since then I read another book that presents a lot of good evidence that the Christ will not come again, but has instead sent a messenger. After reading the message, I am convinced that Lahaye merely repeats and perpetuates false doctrine and dogma, while the real messenger gives us the truth about real prophecy. I encourage you to seek the real truth, because if you seek it you will find it."
4,I Love this Book.,"I bought this book two years ago, after I made my first batch of homemade caramels and wanted to learn more about candy making. What I like about the book is how good the recipes are, how well they are labeled for skill levels for each recipe(super easy, easy, average, advanced and expert), and the way the book is formatted. I'd give it 5 stars except it could use more photos and a better index. The chapter on mints is my current favorite. LOVE the Cream Cheese Mints. Using quality ingredients is always important in cooking but even more so when the recipe uses only a few ingredients at all. So use good butter, good vanilla and good extracts when making these candies. The results are so worth it."
5,Very cool,"Although I haven't made anything as of yet from the cookbook, it host a very large variety of wonderful sounding recipes, I can't wait to have the extra time and a few extra bucks to try out some of these recipes (should be this payday =D ) in the mean time, I'll browse through it often."
5,Who Wants Candy?,Great book with several receipes from easy to advanced for the same candy. Gives you a choice on what recipe to follow. Interesting stories about the candy and how the author came across the recipe.
3,"Wonderful, clearly-written tried-and-true candy recipes","This book is wonderful! It is filled with tried-and-true, well-tested candy recipes clearly written to ensure success, and prefaced by complete descriptions of why they're so special. My only quibble (and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars) is that it has the worst index on the planet (e.g., Luscious Raspberry Fudge Truffles aren't under R for Raspberry, F for fudge, C for chocolate, or T for Truffles, but L for Luscious --which you may not remember is in the name when looking for the recipe), and includes every possible version of every candy, rather than those that taste the best. Nevertheless, it is a wonderful book, and very highly recommended"
1,Totally different songs...,"When I was a child my family did a lot of traveling across the country. We listened to the cassette tape of Paper Lace, The Night Chicago Died, many many a time. Very fond memories. The cover had the four musicians in gangster outfits, holding ?tommy? guns standing in front of a red brick wall. When I saw this C.D. on sale (without any pictues or song listing...) I wanted to get a copy of it for my parents. When I got it I could tell right off that it was not the same album. There are only three songs on it that I remember. And those three songs do not sound the same as I remember it either.Here is the song list for anybody who wants to know.1) Billy Don't be A Hero2) The Night Chicago Died3) The Black Eyed Boys4) Like A Rolling Stone5) The Games People Play6) California7) Sally Brown8) Trinidad Boy9) Guessing Games10) What Do I See In Him11) Turn It Up12) We've Got The Whole World In Our Hands13) Pa' Bradley14) Teach The Teacher"
2,paints an unrealistic picture of life for women pre-taliban,"I lived in Kabul in the late 1970's. Although there were women who went about unveiled, attended university,and appeared to be living a life of equality to men, they were just a tiny fraction of the Kabul elite and in no way represented the lives of the vast majority of Afghan women. Afghanistan is a wonderful country that I dearly love, but it serves no purpose to pretend that they were once had a highly westernized society, where women had unlimited opportunities. Let Afghan women in Afghanistan define what their future is to be, not Western feminists who think that they know what it should be."
5,A bold book....,"""This is a bold book with a clear wake-up call to businesspeople and the result is a heartening and indispensable guide for anyone making critical decisions in business today.""--Jeffrey L. Seglin, author of The Good, the Bad, and Your Business: Choosing Right When Ethical Dilemmas Pull You Apart (Wiley)"
3,Somewhat helpful,"When I bought this for my first grader, I was under the impression that this was a pack of 2 charts. It's not. It's a single, 2-sided slidechart, about the size of a large index card. To me, this was a bit overpriced.But, the real question is; Does it teach kids their math facts? Well, we're still working on it. I keep this in the backseat pocket of the car so that my child can go over a number family on the way to school. He seems to enjoy reading aloud the equations. It works better as something they can do themselves, not something you can quiz them with, as you would with flashcards.I would not recommend this singly to help children with their math facts. A combination of things will help them learn. This slidechart could work well as part of that learning process.But again, I feel this was overpriced. I am still looking for that ""Dream Device"" to help my child master his math facts! Hope this helps you in your search."
1,don't waste your time and money on it!,This is definitelly not the best book on Espiritismo! The author copied most of his material from Alan Kardec's works which can be found free of charge on the internet and which are much more useful then Chris Ochun's work. $20 for 120 barely filled pages - written DOUBLE SPACED TO FILL THE PAGES - is also not a good deal! All in all a waste of money and time!
3,Tub Tunes ring flat,"The flutes do achieve the goal of teaching about notes and effect of the water in the tubes. They DO NOT easily stay in the blue foam holder. There are only 5 'songs' and they only have a portion of each song. This is the biggest disappointment. Nor are there other song cards that can be purchased.Good idea, relatively well-made, kids get bored fast."
2,Flutes Fell Flat,"We had high hopes when we ordered the water flutes. However, we had one that would not hold the seal and water level at all, making it impossible to keep the set tuned. The other problem that my girls ages 7 and 4 had with them was keeping them from spilling after they had the proper water level in them. It took A LOT of parent help to make it work without frustration and it was way to complex for my 4 yr old."
5,VERY GOOD,"This thing is just what I expected. Educational, durable, kids of all ages enjoy. It is one of the best toys I have bought to my daughter (6)."
4,kindove kool,Everyone thought this was so cool when I first got it. My 2 1/2 now 3 yr old son was a little too young to understand how to use it. (tried to drink the water) after some coaching he plays the flute but not measuring the water. I figured he'd grow into it but the product does mold if you do not properly store it. One of the flutes was in a bucket with some other toys and it had faded and started to mold(not a lot /nothing gross). I DO recommend this product if you make sure to hang dry it. I also got the water drums great for rinsing soap off body and hair. I put my flutes in it but the sides mold on that too.
1,Defective Nozzle,I was excited to see this perfume available at a lower cost but unforturnately it was too good to be true. Received the perfume and the nozzle will not work. Even worse Amazon does not allow returns of fragrances because they are considered flamable. Dont order this product!
1,Attention----This is a fake one!!!!,I've been using this perfume since 2006 and I love it. I know the small and I can tell this one is fake immediately. And I can't even return this product. How horrible it is!!!
1,Not the same as the sample.,"Doesn't have the same smell as the sample my wife got at the department store. Even I could tell the difference, and my wife knows her perfume. If I hadn't ordered it directly from Amazon I would think it was fake."
4,"Performs as advertsed, but it is HEAVY!!!","I bought the full sized buckwheat pillow. It is my first pillow of this type, and now I know that the smaller size would have been a wiser choice. Oh, and do NOT unzip this pillow to see what is inside without caution because the buckwheat will come spilling out if you are not holding the pillow so the zipper is exactly on top. There is NO inside container! I plan to turn my large pillow into two smaller ones, which will be more comfortable for sleeing and much easier to handle with my arthritic hands. If I had understood all of this BEFORE buying, I'd be giving this product the full five stars. It really does cradle you comfortabbly without fighting back or packing down."
2,Not worth the money,"I purchased this book after some deliberation as to the expensive price. On receipt of the book I was looking at a book that was similar in appearance to a medium sized novel. The illustrations in the book are of a poor standard as are the maps. Whilst the book does cover the issues it claims to I must say that I was extremely disappointed with it as a whole. My advice is that ""warfare in the classical world"" by Warry would be a much better reference source for those with an interest in ancient warfare and armies."
2,Sketchy overview of ancient warfare,"Bradford provides a sketchy overview of ancient warfare from Egypt through the fall of Rome. This might be useful as a handbook, but in these days of the internet, even this is questionable. The writing is not distinguished, just a simple telling of facts, leaving many, many questions in its wake. Barnes & Noble published a paperback version at a low price, but even this is not worth buying in my opinion. I'll sell my copy at the earliest opportunity."
2,Profoundly disappointing,"From the title one would presume that this book is about ancient weaponry and conversely ancient warfare. However, after reading the first few chapters one can easily see that the book is devoid of any in depth discussion of weaponry or military tactics. In fact much of what is discussed can easily be found on wikipedia, in much more detail.I am glad at least that I found a cheap paperback version and did not expense more than ten dollars on the book."
4,"Chivalry isn't dead, it's taking a vacation","As you can surmise from the title, Reckless is a novel about reckless behaviour; specifically that of one Phoebe Layton. She's forever courting disaster, daring and adventuresome as she is. When she requires the services of a knight to aid her in a quest, figuratively speaking, it just might be that this time she's entered territory where she'll pay the price for her reckless ways.You'll find no surprises here-- the plotlines are all familiar, the relationships progress as expected. It's a fun book, though. Quick does this sort of thing well, seeing as she's an old hand at it, with prolific output. I'm sure if you're reading an Amanda Quick novel you came for the love, not a treatise on the human condition or some such thing. It's love you want and it's love you'll get. Good times!"
1,"Reckless - as in ""All the typos in this book are reckless!""","First, I love this book. I love all Amanda Quick books. However, be warned, the kindle edition has a ton of typos. Literally 1/page on average. Multiples in a sentence are not uncommon. It must be the scanning software they used to convert this older paperback to electronic version? (Though I don't know why they didn't have it on a computer file somewhere... it's not that old.)Eg.""And that wealth was now coupled to a tide that was the equal of Clarington's. With chat kind of fortune and status came power. Great power.""tide= titlechat= thatMy advice? Don't order the kindle version if typos are going to bother you. Other Amanda Quick books for the kindle have a lot of typos too, but this one is by far the worst one that I've read.If I'm going to pay $7.99 for a kindle version of Amanda Quick, I expect it not to have typos!! I won't be purchasing Amanda Quick books for my kindle in the future unless I hear this problem has been fixed!"
4,Reckless,Reckless is a great read with strong main characters. Gabriel and Phoebe are both likeable (though they both have their frustrating moments). They were well suited to one another. It was a very believable and amusing romance. I loved the ending.I'd recommend it to a friend.
1,Quite dissappointing,"I enjoy most of Amanda Quick's book but i have to say, this is not one of them. It was a bad read. I couldn't seem to get into the book because the charcters seemed to unreal. It is definately NOT Amanda's Quick's best. Save your money and time."
1,The Kindle version is awful,"I have been diligently buying my favorite books for Kindle and this is the worst Kindle edition I have ever seen! There are numerous, numerous typos (yes I said numerous twice - because there are so many) and it has really affected my enjoyment of this book - having to stop and figure out what it is supposed to say instead of what it does say. I would guess that this was created using and optical scanner because the words are not misspellings but more like it should be darn and instead it says dam. A HUGE dissapointment!!!"
2,"Intellectual, Wordy, and Boring","You really have to pinch yourself to keep awake for this book. It reminds me of something they made you read in school - you know that there is a lot of stuff going on under the surface, but you don't really care, and you are left waiting for some action. I skipped over entire paragraphs with wordy descriptions of nothing. If you must read this, get it out of the library and save your money."
2,Impossible to stay awake,"I had such high hopes for this book after reading several reviews, but find myself terribly disappointed. The plot is shallow (what there is of it) and the main characters are so boring, I didn't care what happened to either of them. For such a short book, there seems to be endless prose that goes nowhere. The characters dwell on every mundane aspect of their lives and you are left with the feeling that they take themselves far too seriously. The NY portrayed in this book is not the city that I know and love, although the rare glimpses that shine through are what makes it readable. Any comparison to ""Sex and the City"" is mere fantasy--these characters should be that interesting!"
2,Underwhelming...,"Yes, it is a ""quiet"" book --- and, I suppose, the reader is supposed to search beneath the surface to explore the author's subtle inferences, but - why bother??? There is little by way of character development to even care about the people, the plot line was boring, and nothing was said or done that was beyond cursory. A grocery list might have been more entertaining reading. Of course, life is usually mundane, but the author fails to intrigue or even to write in a way that gives the reader new insight or allows us to draw upon our own thoughts or feelings. When I finished the book - a feeling of ""so what"" crossed my mind and of ""ho hum."" (Then I usually marvel at some publisher who actually PRINTED such a bunch of nothing fluff.) Usually I pass books along to fellow readers but this one goes directly into the Goodwill bag. Really, don't bother."
2,could live without meeting them.,"i really didn't care for the characterizations in this book, they seemed lackluster, and shallow. the plot, what little there was of it seemed juvenile. the only things i liked were the ny references."
1,"Irritating Iris, Loser Lana","Women About Town is overhyped. The two main characters are Iris and Lana. Initially, every other chapter is devoted to one of them. I could barely continue reading the chapters on Iris. She is self-absorbed and elitist - not in a tragically funny way. Reading about Lana was more interesting, but she lacks real courage when it comes to her relationship with Sam, and is a passive player in the end. The climax of the book, I guess, is when Lana actually interviews Iris in, gasp, Vanity Fair - which is apparently the BEST magazine for all people in the know. When these two pretentious women meet is the climax??? Their conversation lacks integrity, tension, wit. The book is YAWN boring, the entire plotline a complete disappointment. DO NOT READ if your hopes are to laugh, or see some city women really be successful in their lives. Iris and Lana are very small, and now that I have finished the book, I realize they are inconsequential, as well."
3,Works with compact fluorescent bulbs,"I bought this timer to replace an Intermatic timer that could not handle compact fluorescent bulbs. This one handles them, no problem. The automatic sunset tracking feature is very nice, as is the prominent ""On/Off"" button on the top to use as an override.One thing bugs me, though... Why does it not let you specify the turn-off time? Instead you have to program how many hours you want the lights to stay on. Where we live in the Pac NW, sunset varies from 9PM local time to 4PM. We'd like the lights to go off at 11PM, every night. Nice that it keeps track of the turn on time, but I need to manually adjust the turnoff time every few months to make that happen. What were they thinking?It also would have been nice if you could have it turn on at, say 5:30AM, and turnoff at sunrise. But there's only one cycle per day, so no go."
2,Wall timer can run only one program!,"Watch out--if you want to cycle your lights more than once a day, this timer is not for you."
3,Wish there were more options.,"It works just as it should, I just wish it had more features.If I set the lights to come on at sunset, I have to choose how long they should stay on rather then having the option to turn them off at a specified time. I'd like to be able to have my lights come on at sunset and turn off at 11:00, but instead I have to have it turn off in 2, 4, 6, or 8hrs after it turns on. Which means I still have to reprogram the timer in the winter to stay on longer."
1,Sylvania SA170,"Worked great for 10 months and then started blinking intermittently occassionally. Got worse and when I got around to calling on it. It was 13 months-WARRANTY EXPIRED. Things like this should last for years, not months. Do not waste your money."
2,Good for 12 - 18 months,"I have ~5 of these throughout my house. One by one they are failing. The two in my garage both started rapidly cycling on-off-on-off at random times. One was connected to a normal incandescent the other a CFL - both were on different circuits. The one stopped displaying anything - I replaced it with an identical model and it is now working (for a while, anyways). The other had some sort of internal electrical failure that cause it to dump line voltage to the neutral. I can't say this is any different than my experience with other models including Intermatic, Leviton, etc. - they all seem to fail within 18 months. I don't know what it is about these devices that makes them fail so frequently. Reading around the interweb - 12 - 18 month failure seems very common for these devices."
1,Failed to turn on,"The instructions were difficult to follow. I called the technical support of the manufacturer for assistance. They sent me a simplified version of the instructions. After calling the manufacturer again several times and programmed the switch in all modes, the switch still failed to turn on. So, I am returning the switch."
1,looks nice-BUT,Switch looks good BUT it doesn't do what they say it will. I pulled my old single pole switch -wired as directed and I couldn't turn the lamp off or on with the switch. I then contacted tech support-what a joke ! They told me I must have a three-way switch set up( I do not). At that point I said lets send this back- Amazon was wonderful in that regard.
2,Disappointing,"I found this book to be a big disappointment. I read the reviews and was looking forward to a suspenseful page-turner. However, I had a hard time getting through this book and was bored with the story and the characters. Miss Laracy is the one exception and I would agree with a previous reviewer that she is a character that will remain with you long after you put the book down. I disagree that the author can be favorably compared to Stephen King. King's writing has a richness and his characters a complexity that I found lacking in The Town that Forgot How to Breath."
2,The review that forgot to lie,"This book took me a long time to finish, almost a month, I think. It is slow paced and tends to spin off as if they took a lot of filler from other books that was edited out and crammed them in here.Spinning towards a vapid, hippie ending, it does nothing to save itself from being God awful. Tragically, I think this was a best seller.D."
4,AWESOME TO READ,I LIKE THIS STORY LINE BECAUSE IT WAS DIFFERENT. CHARACTERS IN THE THE BOOK WERE UNIQUE.IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY THAT REALLY GRABS YOU.HARD TO PUT DOWN. WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY ONE THAT LIKES SUSPENSE THRILLER!HAPPY READING!!
2,Disappointed....,"The jacket of this book made it out to be a promising read, but I had to force myself to read this book, as if I was assigned it for school. I wasn't hooked in to an gripping or even mundane plot. It was awful and the thrill/horror never came. The entire premise was interesting, the execution, writing style and flow of book was a failure."
3,Get What You Pay For,Well the object does its job and it keeps the door propped open. But my main concern from the start was how wobbly the thing was when not holding the door open.My most recent problem after a few months of use is that the rubber stopped on the bottom just broke into two pieces. So I am in the market for a second one. Thank goodness they are cheap!Don't let this point you away from buying one. They are a good deal. Just understand you aren't pay a high price so don't expect a super high quality result.
5,"Fair quality, great price","I give these kick stands 5 stars because they are acceptable quality, but a much better pricethan the local Lowes.I ordered 6 and one of them had some very minor imperfections, not visible while standing up.Functionally, works great"
3,Atmosphere: Peterson Field Guide,"Whew. A textbook, heavy on teaching, but short on the field guide part. Yes, there are lots of examples of clouds, but it is really hard to correlate the pics with useful information. I am a complete novice. After the book, I am a confused novice. Lots of words and lots of pics. Heavy on info. Not a field guide in my eye. --great service, great condition, well worth the price I paid."
3,Great Concept Poorly Executed,"The Jump the Shark idea is great--how one of the co-creators communicates it in book form is disappointing. This book focuses mostly on the TV comedies--and it's too brief. Some of the analysis doesn't even make much sense. It seems like he was asked to write a book and put together a few paragraphs for each show as quickly as possible. Little research, some incorrect info, some really poor logic about when a show jumped the shark, and lots of white space when he couldn't think of anything else.And there are some obvious missing shows. For instance, no ""Growing Pains"" or ""Leave It to Beaver""???This is a quick read and nice to pass time with waiting for a plane, but really should have been written by someone who knew what he was talking about."
5,Laughed on every page,"I've been a fan of the site for years. I was thrilled to learn that the book was coming out. What a great read! Jump the Shark applies perfectly to so many things beyond TV. The entries on Celebs, Sports, Music and Politics were all great. I've heard that a game show is in the works. I can't wait."
4,Will your favourite show survive a shark attack?,"This is a good book to get conversations going. ""Jump the Shark"" is a phrase used to indicate the moment when fans knew a great show was on the decline and the magic is or would be over soon. Undoubtedly you won't agree with all the author's shark jumpings but I think that's the point. They're there to make us remember and say, yeah definitely or I don't think so. Best to read this amongst friends to really get the debate going.Most of the American TV shows (there's none from the UK , Aus etc) are in here but some aren't. There's also rock stars although they're mostly from a few decades ago. Sports stars and politicians are here as well although all are American so I've never heard of most. There's a few countries too like Iran and Iraq which the info is a bit dated now but not the shark, it isn't affected.Buy this for the TV shows though. That's where the shark was born and the brilliance of this book exists."
2,Incredibly Sloppy,"The author gives every sign of having done no research or fact-checking at all. I found glaring errors in almost every section where I knew anything ahead of time about the subject. He says that since hosting the Academy Awards in 1996, Whoopi Goldberg has been on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" (which she was actually on from 1988 through 1994). He dates the Beatles ""1964-72,"" two years late on both ends. He says George Harrison ""basically disappeared for the nineties until... 'Cloud Nine,'"" which came out in 1987. The section on politics is a feast of the hugely obvious (is Custer known for anything *besides* Little Big Horn?) where it isn't highly dubious (Waterloo may be the more famous event, but surely the ""shark-jumping"" turning point for Napoleon was the invasion of Russia). The author may have created the site, but he proves himself less competent than many of the site's users to knowledgeably assess pop culture."
5,GREAT FUN!,"What a great book! Just like the website, I can sit and read it for hours! If you love TV, you'll love this book! It also makes a great gift, coffee table book, bathroom read, etc."
2,This book 'jumped the shark',"...This was a very disappointing book. Unlike the truly funny and insightful website, this book is spotty, thematically inconsistent and generally unfunny. The TV shows selected for analysis include some of the worst fare that medium has ever offered. Then the author bounces around to sports, movie actors and politics, subjects that don't fit the whole idea of 'jumping the shark'. What should have been published were the best quotes from those on the website. There were instances where the author seemed to be defensive or unsure of his opinions, diluting the whole concept. This was a good idea that didn't work in the framework the author chose to present it. A slapdash, all over the place jumble of a book, it jumped the shark on page 3."
2,not what I expected,"The website is always cool and fun to look at, but the book got me all excited. I kind of knew what was coming, on all the sports, music and television stuff. I did not think the author was just going to take his mind and opinions and just make money off of them by jotting down his own commentary. I was hoping he would write it based on public opinion, just like the website. ANYONE can post their opinion but I think this book is a piece of junk. He is basically telling people what to like, just like a critic, except in a sneaky harsh way. I also disagree with some of the author's opinions on what jumped the shark, and I wish he would show more proof. I will continue with the website, but like I said this book does not deserve to be on anyone's shelf, not even critics' shelves! I would give points for giving factful information, that's all."
2,About what it says about Three's Company,He claims John Ritter is seen pouring water on Suzanne Somers. Actually it was Joyce DeWitt in the show's opening who pours water on Somers.
4,I have to disagree,"I don't agree with those who say this book in itself has ""jumped the shark"". I like that it doesn't just stick to TV shows like the website. If it were just like the site, what would the be the point in buying the book? I thought the music section was great. I didn't much care for the sports section since I am not really a sports fan, but that didn't diminish the book in my eyes. Fortunately, the book lacks something the website had too much of: arrogant posts that basically said, ""If you don't like what I like, then you must be a ....."" The book maintains a sense of fun without being mean-spirited, and it's an interesting read."
4,Cracked me up...,"This is great as a light, humorous read! As a kind of ""amateur pop culture critic"" myself, I love to read critiques in general, esp. when a good dose of humor is thrown in. So naturally, this appealed...having not been to the related website, I can't compare it to that, but let's just say sudden giggling fits would emanate from my room as I sat and read the description of Styx's Kilroy Was Here concept and tour, the opening sentence of the Jethro Tull section: ""That flute. That damn flute."", etc, etc....lotsa catty fun, I recommend it!"
3,"Fonzie, Michael Jordan, and Adolf Hitler","Some reviewers have noted that this book is all over the map, trying to cover too many topics, but that doesn't begin to cover the problem. How can you compare the beginning of the decline of Germany (and the ascension of the Third Reich) to Fonzie jumping the shark? Um, one was a cheesy TV show and the other involved systematic genocide and the ruination of much of Europe?It's a bit flippant. The politics section in generally cannot be taken seriously; the opinions are facile at best.I didn't bother with the sports section. Even rabid sports fans are often only mildly interested in the history of sports; sports is about winning and losing in the here and now. When did Dennis Rodman jump the shark? I'm not even going to bother to look that up right now as I write this review."
5,"I bought it for the title, but thoroughly enjoyed the book","I saw this book discussed on the Yarn Harlot's web site, and because I am a fan of southern writers, I thought it would be a good read. I was right.I think I am going to add Martini's line, ""Like cellulite, dreams come easily,"" as a signature on my emails. ;)"
2,Depressing book about post partum depression,If you have or had post partum depression do not read this book. On a good note it will make you feel more sane but overall it is very depressing and dark.
2,Not exactly what I was hoping for when I bought this,"""...I finished this book last night, and I have to say, I was kind of glad to be done with it. Not that it was a terrible book, because it wasn't. Not exactly. It was extremely informative, but it wasn't quite what I was expecting. Oxbrow really does take us WAY back, and one goal of his in writing this book was to help dispel some of the myths surrounding the origin of Halloween. I think he presents enough information to convince someone that they've been misinformed of the beginnings of this holiday, but the bulk of the text is mainly quotes and excerpts from the sources he used; there is comparatively little of the author's own narrative. I would have liked to read more about what he had to say, rather than reading his sources and then his opinion on the passage quoted. ...""For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"
1,Not Macrobiotic enough,"If your a vegetarain this book is good, But as far as macrobiotic?..........no way!!! Recipes nearly all contain GARLIC, & other ingredients such as coconut milk........I was pushed hard to find a macrobiotic recipe that was not too YIN...... I actually had an old edition of this book. Back then, the recipes were filled with spices too."
2,Not quite the disaster story I expected.,"After languishing through 932 pages of this book, expecting a ""Lucifers Hammer"" type scenario, I was let down. Williams has taken a potentially wonderful story and turned it into yet another tired racial drama. If you are looking for apocalyptic fiction, do not waste your time."
2,"Interesting idea, predictable conflicts","It's hard to argue with all the rave reviews, but I'm going to. While I found the research that went into _The Rift_ to be impressive, there was nothing about the situations or the characters Williams drew that struck me as interesting or new. Civil disaster causes racial tension to explode in an already divided south. Religious weirdos become weirder when cut off from the civilized world by disaster. Businessmen see it as financial oopportunity and struggle to get to a phone and make money. Youth hold the hope of the future. Etc. The book is positioned as being similar to _The Stand_ but carries none of the freshness that made King's epic of disaster so very good."
3,Interesting read,"I decided to read this bood since I live in the region depicted in the book. I thought the book was quite interesting but was a little dissapointed with the author getting some, though minor, details wrong about the geography (ex. misnammed Smithland KY as ""Smithfield""). Some parts of the story were a little outside the realm of belief but,overall, exciting.Some criticize the near 200 pages of character development at the first but, I thought, the author made good use of it later in the book.Although I gave it three stars, I do recommend it as a good read."
3,Good but not great,"I enjoyed this book, but it wasn't the ""end of the world"" tale I was expecting. A series of earthquakes strike the Missippi valley of the US, and some well-defined and extremely interesting characters find themselves faced with this calamity.Mr. William's story is most interesting when he is showing how people react and take advantage of the chaos and peril that now surrounds them. Some milk the situation, some are responsible for trying to clean up the mess, and others simply try to survive and find lost loved ones. Mr. Williams covers each of these extremely well, and while the story is a tad slow in parts, I found myself flying through it.I gave it 3 stars because even though it was enjoyable story with excellent characters, there was something missing throughout. I think part of it was that even though a significant portion of the US was chaotic and nearly destroyed, you still got the sense that eventually everything would be back to normal."
5,"Shake, Rattle and a Race Battle","I can't remember how I came across this book. For some reason it was in the Fantasy section at my local B&N. After reading it, I realized sticking this next to trolls and dragons is like putting Megadeth in the Easy Listening section. The book is a disaster tale that takes place in the here and now. Unlike modern disaster tales like The Stand and Swan Song there is no supernatural element. But like those books the characters are well developed and entirely believable. Throw in a Tom Sawyer like travel down a bloated Missisippi, an ardent religous end times obsessed pastor and a KKK sheriff and the story flows as quick as said river."
2,Too many characters for the plot.,"This book could have used a good editor. As it stands, the idea is good but the delivery is lacking. Too many characters are introduced to possibly flesh out all of their storylines. The result is a book of mainly cardboard cutouts. The bad characters are evil, and the good characters can do no wrong. Jason has to be the most unbelievable teenager I have ever read. I can't remember exactly how old he was supposed to be, but he sounded forty through most of the book. Trimming some of the barely rendered characters and telling the story through only a few viewpoints would have made the tale much more powerful, as well as leaving more room for the main characters to develop. As it is, ""The Stand"" and ""Swan Song"" are far superior books with similar themes."
2,Too big of a Rift,"I liked this book, but it needed to be about 300 pages less, it got really boring and monotonous at times. Also as far as ""end of the world"" or ""disaster"" novels go, this one just doesnt cut it as exciting and character driven."
2,Couldn't finish it....,"I did my best.. hit 400 pages before deciding I had better books waiting to be read. While the premise of the novel was very interesting, I was unable to find a single character that I actually cared about. One of the things I loved about ""The Stand"" (a book I had heard this one compared too.. good Vs evil following disaster).. was that I actually cared for some of the protagonists. That was not the case with this book. During some of the perilous chapters... I was never on the edge of my seat because I didn't really care if the characters survived or not.I gave it 2 stars in fairness since I didn't finish it.. Maybe it redeemed itself in the second half... however I didn't see an indication it would."
2,Careful on this one!,"I have read many disaster novels over 40+ years of reading SF and alternative history, as it were. ""When Worlds Collide"" and its sequel are still the standard, though I can enjoy Harry Turtledove, among others. This one, however, left me limp. With this ""disaster"" (and I live in Memphis, these days), why focus on a racist deep south Parish and the like when there are hundreds of large cities all with real stories to tell? The urban stories should NOT be side bars to the main action... All I can say is I was extrememly disappointed in this novel - well written though it is. And, my local Goodwill shop got a bargain..."
3,The next Katrina?,"A massive earthquake along the New Madrid Fault shook the Mississippi Valley in 1811, and we're due for another one. This book is about the next major New Madrid earthquake and the violently changed landscape and societal devastation that result. Williams seems to have done his research, and this book makes it seem crazy that anyone lives in the Mississippi Valley.The book follows numerous characters, including an out-of-work aerospace engineer, an adolescent skateboarder from L.A. who just moved to the Midwest with his New Agey mom, a fundamentalist preacher, a KKK sheriff, the general in charge of the Mississippi Valley Division of the Army Corps of Engineers, the manager of a nuclear power plant, and the U.S. President.For my taste, this book was too long with too many subplots and too many bad guys, but it provided many hours of diversion, and it definitely made an impression on me. I will never live in a brick house in St. Louis!"
5,Near future geophysical thriller,"I found The Rift absolutely enthralling -- this is a science fiction novel written like a bestseller, with a near-future setting that's all too believable. Living not far from the events described (I recognized a number of the smaller towns, such as Cape Girardeau and Golconda), I know all too well how poor the state of preparedness in this area is. In fact, many people live in denial and become angry if you try to point out that Southern Illinois is earthquake country."
3,Welcome to the (very) deep South,"This one took a good month or more to read, but it's not really the book's fault. It's a bit slow for much of its length, but in the end it's a pretty decent read. This is Walter Jon Williams , S.F. writer, impersonating someone named Walter J. Williams, mainstream novelist. If he was serious about his masquerade, maybe he should have used a different picture on the jacket. Anyway, the novel revolves around a series of massive earthquakes in the midwest and follows a small group of reasonably well-drawn characters thru the aftermath. The eponymous rift is both a literal reference to the tortured fault lines and a metaphor for the racial chasm that still lies beneath the surface of the south. It's too slow to be an action adventure, but then it runs a bit deeper than that. Not bad, but I do hope Walter gets his ""Jon"" back and keeps writing S.F."
4,Good but the preacher clan and KKK sheriff is a little over the top,"At the advice of some here, I bought this (used since out of print) and finally read it. I thought it was a apocalypse story but it is a disaster story (not my favorite). I like the book as it spent a LOT of time on building the characters but I did not like the Armageddon preacher clan nor the KKK sheriff. Just seemed a little over the top to me."
2,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. Some 200 plus pages in I realized I was going to be disappointed. Why? It dawned on me that after all of the author's pages of character development, there was not one character I was actually interested in or cared about. The beginning was slow and frankly boring. I may or may not finish this book, given its length.Of course, I had just finished ""Earth abides"" and ""Alas Babylon"" so maybe it seemed even worse than it actually was in comparison to those two entertaining works."
2,Ok...but you can find better.,"The Rift starts out with a great idea...and by starts out I mean you are 150 pages in before anything 'catastrophic' happens. BUT, the idea is good: earthquake shatters life as we know it.Unfortunately, as I just mentioned, he spends a good portion of the book giving us useless info. Just like I did with the long version of The Stand, I found my scanning PAGES of this book trying to pick the actual storyline back up. And the story lines are just not that compelling. Of course we have the religious fanatic camp. And the racist camp. And then the 'nuclear accident waiting to happen' camp. And that's it.This book turns into 'what would happen on a small stretch of the Mississippi River if a once-in-a-lifetime earthquake hit.' If you're looking for a good take on a post-apocalyptic America after the ""big one,"" this is not your book. If you're looking for a book in search of a good editor, you are in luck."
2,lots of water,I was somewhat disappointed with the story. I think people have evolved much more than depicted in this book.
1,Stolen idea,"This novel is basically an expanded rip-off of Allan Danzig's short story ""The Great Nebraska Sea,"" which was written in 1963. Williams could have done a lot more with a lot less. If length hath merit, Williams' novel hath no other."
1,A Disaster of a Novel,"I've never written a novel, but I have read enough of them to know that having some sympathetic characters is a necessity especially in a ""disaster"" novel. If I had to live with the people in this book I'd be praying for the disaster to happen that would wipe them all out. The ""bad"" characters are so over-the-top they're laughable cliches; and the ""good"" characters are just pathetic. I wasted my time reading almost 200 pages in this book before I decided it just wasn't worth it. I didn't care what was going to happen. Do yourself a favor and pass on this one. Find a copy of ""Lucifer's Hammer"" it's a much better and more believable disaster story set in the USA."
3,"Starts slow, then speeds, then S-L-O-W-S!!!!","The book is based on an earthquake of a huge magnitude, and what life would be like afterwards. I thought the sex was very gratuitous and unneeded, and actually distracting.The last few chapters really dragged, it was chore to force myself to finish reading. All and all, not a bad book, but it think it could have used a bit more editing."
1,Very Disappointing,"I saw this book at Barnes & Noble and thought it looked awesome. Every time I read a few pages, I'd fall asleep. I looked at other reviews for this book and saw it showed promise. I got past the first 200 pages and kept hoping it would get better. There are a few passages in this book that were great, but I had to quit reading once I got to Chapter 18. I kept pushing myself to continue reading, but I couldn't go on. I'm glad others have enjoyed this book and I think the plot itself was great to write about with vivid characters and the goal of survival. There was just too much information added to this book that had nothing to do with the story itself. This is probably the only book I decided to quit before reaching the end, but there are too many other good books out there waiting to be read."
3,"Close, But No Cigar","I started this book with high expectations - maybe because the beginning reminded me of two of my favorites - Lucifer's Hammer and Footfall - in that there were numerous story lines with ""tidbits"" of pure scientific data thrown in. There was ample opportunity here for the author to hit a home run, but somehow, things just never came together. The main storylines just seemed to fizzle out and become more ridiculous chapter by chapter, and somehow the book tailed off and ended with a wimper..... HONEST! I wanted to love this book, but it didn't happen."
2,Hate these sunglasses in the heat,"Last pair I will own, Bolle sunglasses tend to fit strange, but that's fine. What I don't like is they really have no airflow so you sweat around the eyes and temples, I got a bunch of zits where the glasses touch the skin when I tried to ride my mountain bike with them. I was very disappointed as their really isn't much special about the lens. Don't use for active wear, these are more for sitting on top of your head to look cool"
1,Really break easy,Really break easy. I normally buy pridegreen but they were out of stock so I tried these. The quality just doesnt compare. I like the thought behind the bag however.
1,Worthless,These bags are completely worthless. They break before you can even get them into your garbage can let alone fill them up. The seam on one side of the bag just completely comes apart under no pressure. DO NOT BUY THESE!! If you do you are wasting your money. There are other recycled garbage bags that can actually hold garbage.
3,"I want to like them, but ...","These are just ok. If using recycled materials is important to you, maybe these are worth it; I'm still undecided. I'm not under the illusion that these are earth-FRIENDLY (how could any plastic bag be that?), but I am glad that Seventh Generation makes an effort to use post-consumer and recycled content; small bits count. However, the bags themselves aren't great. Not terrible, but they leave something to be desired. Specifically, they seem to break under less strain than most kitchen bags, and they lack a drawstring. These two things combine to mean that they can't hold very much without breaking. We try to limit our household waste anyway, but still--nobody wants garbage leaking all over the place when it comes time to take it out, and taking it out more often means we're using more bags, which is kind of counterproductive from a waste standpoint. So, like I said, these are ok. At least the price was decent."
2,sometimes it's fun to act suicidal,"Most of this album makes me want to bash my head on the wall. Repeatedly. However, there are 4 or 5 songs I actually like. I have fun wailing along with Oberst's ridiculously melodramatic, warbling vocals, thinking all the while, ""Oh, woe is me! Oh, alas, I'm SO depressed... NO one understands me, NO ONE!"" To the people who hate this album, try to see it in a new light... it's FUNNY! If you still hate it, no problem. I understand. (I'm also surprised more people don't find the ""interview"" humorous. It makes me laugh every time I hear it.)"
1,"IT'S BLACK AND WHITE, HATE OR LOVE BRIGHT EYES...","Bright Eyes? Oh please they're the next ""emo."" Actually they sound like an acoustic emo band. Throw in a few minor chords on acoustical guitar, some horned-rimmed glasses, i bet connor plays his live set as with a back-pack, then cries in between each song; maybe even recites some Nietzsche or diary entries. I have to give them credit, i honestly thought the name bright eyes would have already been chosen by some other emo kids, i guess he beat them to it.Oh, and i must mention the pretentious stagged interview at the end, blah--- we all feel your pain connor"
1,The Interview Is Hilarious,"The interview tacked onto the end of ""An Attempt To Tip The Scales"" is horrible. This guy wants to be deep, but he can't get over his intellectual limitations. Here is one of the many faux-profound exchanges:Interviewer: 'How about this Ariennette (sp)? How does she fit into all this?'Oberst: 'I'd prefer not to talk about it... in case she's listening.'Interviewer: 'Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize she was a real person.'Oberst: 'She's not. But... I made her up.'Interviewer: 'Oh, so she's not real.'Oberst: 'Just as real as you or I.'Interviewer: 'I don't think I understand.'Oberst: 'Neither do I, but after I grow up I will. I mean, a lot of things are really unclear for me right now.'""The interview just kills the album. Not that it was ever living to begin with."
1,sickening,"whatever you do, do not listen to Bright Eyes. his voice will induce nausea, dizziness, and everything other than emotion. i can't believe the band is actually playing MUSICAL instruments in the background. sounds more like industrial, atonal noise backing up his sick warble of a voice."
1,"When I finished this album, I had a fever.","If Oberst's dream was to write some extremely heartfelt and beautiful songs for this album, he has failed. I almost grabbed my remote and hit the eject button but I was stunned by the only good song on the album ""Calender Hung Itself"". If you're an emo twelve-year-old that loves My Chemical Romance, I highly reccomend it."
1,Wow this is amazingly.....,"..... bad. Don't bother. Immature, shallow, BS teen angst lyrics. Predictable, tired, same-old-formula music. It's produced and mixed well. That's about the only positive thing I can say about this dreck. Use the money and go buy some toilet paper."
2,Jesus Christ! What has Omaha become!,"I am from Omaha, and oh my god, Conor is so hot, and I want to have his babies, and this one time he looked at me and he was totaly like, oh my god, I can't believe it! He is so hot, and I like totally want to do him, and I am so stoked for his concert, oh my god!I liked his earlier stuff, until he started ""taking himself seriously as an artist"". That was the downfall. If you like this indie rock, you should try someone who's not a complete and total rip off of other Omaha figures like Simon Joyner (EARLY Simon, now he's just a Leonard Cohen ripper-offer). Try to find Solid Jackson, try to find it on Vinyl. Be indie rock. Emo is stupid.Get some cassettes. Quit being stupid. Hate everyone. Grow a soul! Us Omahans just make fun of all the emo posers anyways.Or you could just go dye your hair black, you fasion-core chump."
3,Pretentious,Conor Oberst is nothing more than pretentious fake. Though I was a fan at one time his continuing emo act got old fast. Here is a guy with millions of dollars and a whole lot of hanger-ons trying to play a lonely normal kid. It's an act.Some of the writing on this cd is quite good though. Just don't think of Conor as anything special. He's a musical hack.
2,BRIGHT EYES MAKE BABY JESUS CRY.,"COngratuglaions Oberst and Co. you've managed to fool just about everyone into hailing this heap of steaming excrement in cd form as the most promising release from the most promising indie band known to mankind. If this is the case, please, promise me a quick painless death. This cd makes little children cry, dogs howl in pain and if my theory is correct, causes a dangerous rift in the space-time continuum. Seriously now, why Connor Oberst is hyped as our lord and saviour to be is completely beyond me. See my review for Lifted... if you want to read the rest of my anti-Bright Eyes, anti-scensters diatribe. Anyways, thank god for hip-hop."
1,This album creates soul wounds,This album wounds the soul and worsens depression. Please do not listen to it.
1,THE IRRITATING NOISES,"this IS ""Contrived caterwauling!"" This music is horrible. Some whiny guy pandering to an incestuous indie rock culture full of hate and fashion fascism. GO LISTEN TO THE CURE INSTEAD!!! (he's just a terrible, off-key version of Robert Smith anyway... why not just get the real deal and be done with it?)"
4,heart on sleeve,"A very emotional, personal work as is the trademark with Bright Eyes records. Conor is quite the talented songwriter and that, plus his willingness to hold nothing back, is what carries the album.My gripes aboout the record: The first three tracks fall flat after repeated listenings. And the mock interview recording near the end; amusing once or twice... should have been at the very end of the record or at least a seperate track so you could program it out.If you get the chance, see him play live."
5,brilliant.,"i saw bright eyes perform two nights ago in Phoenix. let me just take this opportunity to say that it was one of the best shows ive ever seen- Conor Oberst is absolutely brilliant. he played with such intensity and brutal honesty... at one point, he actually knocked over the chair he was sitting in and fell on the floor, toppling a mic stand and hitting his head on the drum set.after a magical performance, i rushed over to purchase a cd. i actually picked up the '95-'97 collection, while my bf grabbed 'fevers and mirrors'. his was the one that occupied the cd player for the next two days.in lieu of being a lot more polished than the '95-'97 collection, i think 'fevers and mirrors' better represents the mindblowing musical experience that is bright eyes.buy this album- you wont be disappointed."
4,Gotta listen to it quite a few times...,"...before it starts to sink in. I saw them live just about 2 months ago and they were incredibley exciting. Conor packs as much excitment on stage as he does in his albums. While he didn't play the songs I was hoping for (""Sunrise, Sunset"", ""a Perfect Sonnet"", ""A Poetic Retelling of an Unfortunate Seduction"") he did play a few from this CD. ""Center of the World"", ""Something Vague"", and ""Arinette"" were all played. Those are also probably 3 of the most emotionally intense songs on this CD. ""Center of the World"" is filled with incredible lyrics. The more I listen I like. If you can find this CD in a store, buy it. If not order it on-line. It's well worth it to check out."
2,Not that hot,"This cd reminds me of ""The Magnetic Fields"" last opus, not so much for the music, although there are elements here of an over-theatrical nature, but because this also failed to live up to my expectations. I don't object to the personal nature of the lyrics, though some others might accuse Oburst of whiney angst, but he needs heart-rendering tunes to back them up. For the most part the songs lack a strong enough sense of melody to convince me.On a pedantic note, claiming that they were recorded at the end of the 20th Century might be meant to add extra importance to them, but factually it's wrong."
5,amazing,"just bought this cd after buying Lifted. surprisingly, i found this one to be more easily listenably and accessible than Lifted (still can't stand the first track on that cd). for people claiming he's off key, i didn't find that problem in this cd.the whole cd just works so amazingly well. all the songs go together with many reoccuring themes and almost a storyline going through it, which is very interesting. also, the lyrics are amazing and don't seem to jump all over teh place like what sometimes happened in lifted. soo...yeah just buy it!"
5,Great CD... if you look past the whining.,"I really like this CD, especially tracks 3, 5, and 11. But it is just way too much of a downer (and often to slow and drawn out) to listen to regularly in its entirety. I like ""Lifted"" and a bunch of Bright Eyes' earlier work a little better. For me, Bright Eyes' albums are each an experience, and a few tracks can always be extracted and played repeatedly. That's about as much as you hope for in an album, right?"
2,i guess he's just a little too sensitive,"this would probably be a good record were someone else to take on the lyrics, and if oburst had decided not to do that tortured artist screamish thing that he does so well on at least one song. but those are just the most empty lyrics. in ten years time he'll have john lennon glasses and a ponytail..."
2,boo-hoo! hoo!,"snot-nosed sixteen-yr-old psuedo-anxiety... whining over and over about the ultimately unimportant, but doing so with such a torrent of self-pitying, and melodrama that all those who enjoy neat little phrases of bitterness to repeat to themselves as they mournfully sob through the day will love it desperately. A band for insecurity and trivially geared weep-fests. ...Musicianship is good, finding certain redemptions among the stretches of nice-but-not-so-special parts."
2,yummy,"Unlike the other people who have posted their opinions about Fevers and Mirrors, I was sorely disappointed by this Bright Eyes album. It does not compare to Letting Off the Happiness in any way, shape, or form, and although I'm usually all about growth and evolving sound from musicians, it seems to me that Bright Eyes took a step backward with this recording."
4,Painful and Ecstatic,"Someone gave me a Bright Eyes Cd, as I'd mentioned liking the odd bit of emo. From what I'd heard about them, they were not what I was looking for, but I gavi it a listen anyway.I can best describe this album as ""songs for intense people"". In the same vein as Dashboard Confessional, Conner Oberst cannot sing. This will be plain to anyone who listens to the album just once, but you need patience with this CD. Listen to it three or four times, and you'll find something in the lyrics that you like, maybe it's the imagery or the intensity when he shouts and his voice cracks. Definitely give it a few plays, don't judge it on one listen, and look at the lyrics. Conner Oberst is a poet and a fantastic songwriter, but a truly awful singer. Don't let the latter put you off the former.Pay special attention to Track Nine: Center of the World.If you like this, try also Dashboard Confessional: The Places You Have Come To Fear The Most"
4,More of Frank and Sara,"I've enjoyed reading the gaslight mystery series mainly because of the relationship between Detective Sargent Frank Malloy and midwife Sara Brandt, and the depiction of turn-of-the-century life in New York. For readers who like a challenging mystery, this is not the series for you, as the crimes are easily figured out. The relationship between Frank and Sara is slowly developing as they work together to solve crimes, and I am looking forward to the next book to see how it progresses."
5,English Mystery,"Murder on Marble Row ... a keeper and I read this in just 2 days! One of a series of Gaslight novels. This was a third party purchase, fast delivery super easy price on the pocket. Now, I have to be sure and order two more in the series. You do not have to begin with the first book, easy explanation of past events."
1,Never received item ordered!!!,I waited on the book to come and it never came. I was very disappointed that I never received the order! However I did get a full refund for the product.
3,the album that could have been better,"I'm a big mortal fan, and I love Lusis, Fathom, Pura and I'm starting to get used to Nu-En-Jin, but this album wasn't the best thing I've heard by this dynamic duo. I'd have to say my favorite song on here is Fray Lagoon. The rest of the songs just kinda lack something. It's not horrible, but it's not the greatest thing I've ever heard. But, if you're a big mortal fan like me, it's still worth getting. You never know which song might grab your interest."
3,"Daffy: ""Messerschmitts! A whole mess of Messerschmitts!""","Highlight of this meager program (4 animations) is a war-related short now considered politically incorrect.Also here is a Daffy boxing toon featuring the only appearance of ""Larramore,"" an unfamiliar rabbit that soon transitioned into a major star and an animation influenced by Warner's success withTHE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD(1938).PROGRAM--DAFFY - THE COMMANDO (1943) - Hilarious WWII propaganda piece has Daffy Duck taking on the entire Third Reich.ROBIN HOOD MAKES GOOD (1939) - Smallest squirrel rescues his friends from a hungry fox.TO DUCK...

4,The versions in this edition,"The Library of America goes to great lengths to offer the most authoritative editions of the literature they publish. If you browse its website, you'll find much historical information about the texts that are chosen. In the case of Sister Carrie, the first (and unexpurgated) version is used for this volume."
2,very disappointing,"I have read of all Minette Walters' books and having read the blurb of this one, was really looking forward to it. I think the theme is a terrific one. However, this was not like her usual style at all. The writing was heavy and ponderous and I particularly did not like how much time and energy she wasted on the thoughts of the paedophile and his father when they had the young doctor as a hostage and prisoner. The book was so ""busy""with all the runnings around of the crowd during the fire that it generated an uneasy feeling in me. The action snapped back and forth at an alarming rate. Not at all a pleasure to read. Hope she goes back to her previous style in her next book. She used to be able to create very good psychological thrillers."
3,"Gritty, Violent and Disappointing","If your looking for a book with lots of coarse language, disturbing violence, and a unresolved, unsatisfying ending, this book is for you. I've read all of Minette Walters previous books and enjoyed them all. This one is so dark and depressing and different from all previous that I wish I would have left it on the shelf. If I want to feel that way, all I have to do is turn on the news. There were parts that held my attention, therefore the 3 stars, if not for that, it would have been 0."
2,big let down...,read her two books shape of snakes and tinder box..loved them..this one is so annoying..honestly..i was bored from the first chapter. her writing style is becoming predictable and not only that how can anyone explain the NOT coming of police in a riot just coz the road is barracaded?????? I MEAN GET A CRANE and remove the cars and stop the mob let them spread????all characters are total idiots including the main sophie who is just as bad as that old man...left it half way.want my money back huff!!
2,Nothing worth reading,"This was my first book by Minette Walters, and one of the most annoying books Ive ever read. Maybe the basic plot is decent, but beyond that it amazes me that Walters has ever been published. This book stands as nothing more than a symbol of the ease at which most people are entertained, picking this book up thinking its doing them more good than watching tv, when its actually got worse writing than a bad tv movie. The picture of Walters on the back cover provided a few laughs though.Oh, and my apologies for my own poor writing in this review, but I've only done this in the hopes that would be buyers spend their money elsewhere, spending much time and effort on this would have been a complete waste, and I've already wasted enough time on this garbage."
2,Disappointed,"This was not my first Brooks saddle. I have a B17 I've been riding for years. I bought the B67 for my touring bike. After my first ride I had to turn the adjustment nut five times. After my second, the saddle was very loose and I needed to turn the nut 7 or 8 times. Bottom line, the leather stretches way too fast. I punched and laced it, but still sagging. I would not recommend this saddle."
2,My butt hates it!!,"There does indeed seem to be a lot of great reviews for this saddle, and that's the basis upon which I bought it. But boy did my bony butt hate it! There's a lot of talk about how it eventually molds to shape your butt better and consequently improves comfort, but I'm not going to sit on what feels like a piece of steel and suffer for weeks to see if that actually happens. It immediately causes pain in my butt and the area right behind my scrotum (whatever that's called! ha) When I put the Bontrager seat back on that came with the Trek bike, it was immediate and heavenly relief! I'll be selling the Brooks saddle or trashing it. I can't refute those who love this saddle. We're all slightly physiologically different. All I can say is to try before you but if possible."
4,An excellent resource,"This is an excellent resource for those interested in the way Ecuador and its people live and work, the Ecuadorian institutions, customes, and idiosyncrasies. However, some material is oudated since the book covers events up to 1999, and quite a lot has happened in this country in the decade since."
4,Junie B. Jones Has a Monster Under Her Bed,My 7 year old daughter loves these books. She can't get enough of them. They really are good serial books for children who have just started to read on their own.
2,"Can't stand the ""kindergarten grammar""","This is the first and last Junie B. book I will read to my 5-year-old. I can't read straight from the book with a good conscience because the grammar is so poor. I don't want to introduce my articulate kindergartener to such a horrible use of language, so I've had to translate to proper grammar while reading. That's just not much fun.If you want to reinforce bad grammar habits while reading to your child, this is the book for you."
1,Bad Grammar,"My daughter picked out this book at her school book fair. The story line was OK. Both my 6 and 3 year old liked the story. What I didn't like was the BAD grammar used in the book. I suppose that the author was trying to write like a kindergartener speaks, but I was not amused. I think this book reinforces bad speaking and spelling habits. We will not read another book in this series again."
3,Monster! Monster!! Monster!!! NOT,"I am 8 years old and Iiked the parts where Junie B Jones kept going into her mom and dads room. This was a fun and easy book for me to read but I think it is for littler kids, not third grade. I also have read Junie B Jones and the Stupid Smelly Bus and I liked it more. Katie, Wade Elementary School"
2,Probably our first and last Junie B.,"This was our first experience with Junie B. Jones. The story itself was pretty cute and somewhat humorous. I definitely won't go out of my way to read another book in this series. The grammar through out the book was completely annoying. I do realize that it is suppose to be out of the mouth of a five year old. However, that doesn't change the fact that it drove me nuts to read it! Yes it is an easy read for a child new to chapter books. But there are better books out there."
5,Monstery!!!!!,"This book was hilarious, mysterious, and a little bit scary. I almost couldn't stop laughing. This book was about Junie B. thinking she had a monster under her bed and her friends were trying to help her figure out if she really did. She thought she had a monster under her bed because her classmate told her that everyone has a monster under their bed. Junie B. really got scared when she realized that there was a wet spot on her pillow every morning and started thinking that the monster under her bed was drooling on her, but her mom told her that everyone drools, not just babies.This book was truly amazing and I think you should definitely try reading it. Junie B. has a great sense of humor and is always making me laugh. This book was one of the funniest books I've read."
1,Terrible grammar,"My 6 year old daughter brought this book home from school to read. It was her first Junie B. Jones book. The grammar throughout the book is terrible. I don't know if the book was written so the main character would come across as being cute, but she doesn't come across this way at all. She's really pretty obnoxious, and the grammatical errors are offensive. This is one of my daughter's first chapter books she was able to read herself - thankfully, she was savvy enough to be able to point out all the grammatical mistakes as she was reading. I hope she doesn't bring home anymore Junie B. Jones books. I actually think they should be removed from the school."
1,It scared my cousin! Not so good!!!!!,"This book makes kids think monsters are under their beds, waiting to eat their toes after they're asleep and put the kid's head in its mouth. This story isn't the best for little kids. My little 6-year-old cousin, Ginny, got this book and I read it to her. She got scared. I do not like this book. It can scare kids, it scared me a bit. I like reading Junie B., but I don't like Monster Under the Bed. It isn't as good as the others. From, Indy J., Third Grader"
4,Cool book!,This book was great! I love it! :) author is great! :) :) it's so funny!!! Really cool book! :)
5,Great & Wonderful,It is very intereresting to listen too many times the songs. All of them have much to say. The special voice of Bob Via mixes perfectly with the very original sound of the band. Without doubts it is a group that is going to have an excellent future. Wan Santo Condo came to stay with us a lot time. I wish hear them in concert as soon as posible.
4,Good Book for VB Migrators,"C# For Dummies claims to take novice programmers into the world of C#. That's probably a stretch--if you haven't programmed before, I suspect you would have a tough time keeping up. But as an experienced VB programmer moving to C#, I have found it quite helpful. Easy, breezy read, with a focus on the language itself (rather than .Net framework classes or Visual Studio). Most programs are console apps, although the book walks the reader through creation of a Windows app. Only negatives: Code on CD doesn't always match up with cook listings (as at p. 261). Also, like most Dummies books, it's a bit light on learning exercises for the reader. I'm using the book as a general introduction to the language, before I dig into more detailed texts."
1,No useful device,"I bought the ear piece. The device never work at all due to the lack of drives. I do NOT recommend to purchase this item. If you bought it and it is not working, we should ask for you money back."
1,Do Not Buy!,"I was so excited to receive this new gadget, but I should have listened to the previous reviews. The sound quality is terrible! I've purchased cheaper products that performed way better. My computer does not pick it up as a headset and on my cell phone, it sounds like a jarbled mess. Save yourself the money and don't buy, you will regret it!"
1,Do Not Buy this product,"Logitech should have postponed they're release on this product. I've had it for a week now and it only worked on the first day. After you recharge the headset (which only lasts for 7 hours when used with ventrillo or teamspeak) it auto disconnects from the receiver and will NOT reconnect. I visited Logitech's forums and have encountered several other customers complaining of the same problem. The product is flawed right now, so I would not recommend buying it at this time. If/when it gets fixed, i'll update my review."
3,Hmmmmmm,"I bought this product for skype applications and on first attempt after installation software was not able to make it work. I called Logitech and they were unable to as well. They suggested I had a defective unit. The company I purchased from graciously sent another device and I was able to reinstall the software and utilize with ease using the Skype application. I was very pleased. Additionally, the device could be used as a bluetooth headset for my cell (which was much easier to hook up and worked fine). The problem came when I tried to use for my skype application last nite. I shut off the phone, as directed, intiated skype and made a call that did not work (yes I checked all the audio settings). I am perplexed. I will explore whether my laptop's bluetooth fuction is the culprit. At this point, I wish I would've paid 20 bucks more for the other headset I was considering. The verdict is still out but feeling a bit frustrated, B"
2,First 2 seasons only,"I bought this book for my son who didn't watch the series the first time around. He is now obsessively watching them on NetFlix. I only gave the book two stars because it only recaps the first 2 seasons. I was very disappointed when the book arrived. I looked closely at the description and it doesn't say anything about that fact.If you are looking for a comprehensive book about Lost, then this is not the book you are looking for."
5,Great guide to an engrossing show!!,This guide will help those of you that haven't been following the show since the first season.
5,Very informative companion guide!,"I highly enjoyed this Companion Book to the hit tv series LOST. It was very informative, and appeared to have alot of input from the show's creators, JJ Abrams and Damon Lindelof."
4,Must have for LOST fans.,"Great item for diehard fans. Even if you are new to the show, it has plenty of information to keep you updated on what's going on. The DVD is a big disappoitnment. So don't buy it because of that. Other than that, I loved the book."
2,I could have wrote this book....,"My husband and I are potentially going to relocate on a expat basis to China. We have never been to China and know very little about the country. I purchased this book in anticipation that it would be ""an indipensable cross cultural guide to working and living in china"". It was a complete and total joke. The book was full of fluff and completely vague. It totally lacked any specific examples pertaining to not only China but being an expat in general. Seriously, I could have wrote this book it contained such little information. I guess you get what you pay for, and this book was cheap. I did not watch the dvd, so my comments are limited to the book only."
5,This book changed our lives,"Yes, this book is well-researched and smartly-written and engaging to boot, but most importantly, it literally changed our childbirth plans. I'd been hoping to have a natural childbirth in a freestanding birth center, but since there are none in my state (!!), I thought I'd go with a natural birth in the hospital, or better yet, in a hospital with birthing rooms. Reading this book made me see that this kind of birth puts you at risk for the exact kinds of things you seek to avoid in a hospital birth. We ended up choosing a homebirth and it was the best decision I've ever made. My birth was beautiful, empowering, and completely safe, though because it was very long, if I had been in a hospital, I would have ended up with a C-section.I wouldn't trade my homebirth, one of the best experiences of my life, for anything, and I credit this book with helping me come to that choice."
2,Not very impressed. with midwives.,"This book reveals that what midwives do and what OB-GYN's do is basically the same. As near as I can tell, the only difference between the two is that the midwives has slightly longer prenatal visits and get paid less per delivery. They see almost the same number of patients in a day, juggle the same number of laboring patients, rotate delivery call (17 midwives in the group- more than most OB groups), change shifts, and intervene just as often as the Doc's. Almost all the midwife patients had epidurals and pit, and delivered on thier backs in a hospital bed. I believe I'll just skip the midwife and go to the OB-GYN so I won't risk getting handed off to a stranger on delivery day."
1,I STILL DON'T HAVE MY BOOK!!!!!,I STILL DON'T HAVE MY BOOK!!! I'm going to need it in a week and a half but have not received it yet. I've never had this problem before!
4,Very Helpful,This book was very helpful for it's intended purpose; very easy to read. However it was a little outdated and I did not like the group therapy approach.
4,Great Fun!,This turned out to be a great read. The characters were all well written and the plot was unique. I will definitely try her other book!
3,"Good ideas, but lacks substance","I found the commentary from each designer interesting and occassionally insightful, but this was not the interior designer's resource book its description touts it to be."
3,Smaller....,"This was for my mum, she normally wears 5.5, but somehow she couldn't even fit her feet in this. I guess Naturalizer size runs smaller than others."
2,Like the look but not the noise.,"This shoe looks great and is comfortable but so noisy when walking that I didn't take it on vacation, which was the purpose of the purchase. The clacking noise when walking is loud and annoying. These will end up in the donation bag. Too bad."
3,Not a fan,"First let me say that I think Jonathan Maberry is a skilled writer. He has talent. But in reading 'Ghost Road Blues' which is my introduction to his books I found it to have a distinctive, unpleasant and undeniable Stephen King flavor. I kept thinking about all the Stephen King books I wish I'd never read while wading through this book.I recently heard an interview with Mr. Maberry and found him very talented and interesting. However I won't be investing in any more of his books as long as he is emulating this model of writing that leans so heavily upon very graphic descriptions of violence, sex and alleged misery and hopelessness of the human condition. Sorry.Kate Fisher"
1,The most dreadful book I ever read,I somehow managed to finish Ghost Road Blues. And I just want to say that it is easily among the most [...] written and dreadful books I have read. Just makes me mighty disillusioned to see [...] like this getting such [...] reviews. [...]
5,Sinister and Satisfying,"The new book by Jonathan Maberry, GHOST ROAD BLUES, is a sinister story of some very nasty goings-on in small town America --some of which are overt (a hunt for a serial killer) and some of which are cleverly below the radar. The result is that this, the first of a trilogy, builds to a satisfying conclusion that will leave readers (like me) wanting more."
5,American gothic?,"Ghot Road Blues is a good old fashioned ghost story that takes place in rural Pennsylvania. Creepy old farms, strange goings-on, and a hidden evil....all of the things I like to see in a modern gothic novel."
5,Really good,This was a really good story. It was really suspenseful and I couldn't wait to see if Crow would finally beat Ruger (and I won't tell you if he does or not). This book is highly recommended. This is Maberry's first book and it had me never stopping. I put it down and 2 minutes later i pick it back up. One of the greats.
5,Fantastic,"This book is absolutely fantastic.It has all things I look for in a book - suspense, action, and a great plot.I was hooked quickly in and look forward to reading the next books in the series. Jonathan Mayberry has a way with writing great horror and action and he is truly a voice of the next generation.This is a great book for people who like grisly horror, well-paced action, and a deep, intriguing plot."
5,Awesome surprise!,"I saw this book in the bookstore and I contemplated buying it for about ten minutes since I had never read Jonathan Maberry before. I really loved it, even though it had some ghost stuff and I'm more of a real-world sort of gal. Even so, he keeps you guessing and turning the pages; plus there was a promising excerpt from the next book at the end."
5,"Profound, Startling and Exquisite!","I have to say this is the first book I have ever read that made my heart beat helplessly, in broad daylight! Maberry not only overlaps and collides a number of fascinating plots, but he brings together such real characters and personifies the true power of darkness, and the desperate power of hope. I was entranced by this novel and cannot wait for the next!"
2,Second fiddle,"It's a broad big picture horror novel along the lines of King's ""The Stand"". What I didn't like was that the supernatural element of the book plays second fiddle to the natural element, a serial/spree killer. Much of the plotting involves police procedural goings-on, that don't seem real, in that the huge threat sparked by this crazy spree killer that has killed dozens is left to a few city cops assisting some country bumpkins. I didn't buy it. I found this book to be pretty disappointing. If you're looking for an excellent horror read try Chasing the Dead: A Novel by Joe Schreiber; or The Harrowing by Alexandra Sokoloff."
3,Held my attention,"I heard a lot of good things about this book leading up to my purchase of it and I did enjoy it.It held my attention for the span of a few days so I was able to finish it but there were a few things about it that just didn't gel. The writing was good for the most part, although it had a tendency to delve into cliche at times.Interesting idea to start the novel but by the end I wasn't sure I liked the direction it was heading. Worth a read if you can get it for cheap."
5,A great creepshow,"The Stephen King reference there is deliberate. Jonathan is as close to King as you can get without being King. I don't mean that he is copying King; not all. He's far too good a writer to need to copy anyone! GHOST ROAD BLUES has some inspired nastiness and some good chuckles along the way. Best of all, it's genuinely scary. This is no dead end road."
5,From Folklore to Fearsome Fiction,"I heard the author of Ghost Road Blues, Mr. Maberry, give a talk on Saturday at a Borders Books in Paramus and was fascinated by the backstory he gave, how his research into folklore led to his writing a horror thriller. That store sold out of the book and I had to get it from a Barnes and Noble, and spent all day Sunday reading it. What a remarkable story! Strong characters and a convoluted plot that make reading it a real pleasure."
3,Gotta agree with Scott Brooks' review,"It's interesting, but I never thought about it until I read the review from Scott Brooks below. If you check on each reviewer's list of reviews, most of them are from first-timers who never reviewed a book before and/or just happen to live in the same area as the author.As for the book itself, it's an OK read. I picked it up because it was compared to Stephen King and Peter Straub. It does have a lot of their elements, perhaps too many, like its a melange of elements from their works. But it's a good read for a first-time writer. Some of the dialogue was cliched, check out the Tow-Truck serial killer's monologues, and too many coincidences,like he was throwing too much into the book. Hopefully his next book will have more originality and better dialogue. I would give it a 2.5, but since there are no fractions I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and vote him the full 3."
5,Excellent story,"This is a first in the Pine Deep trilogy written by Jonathan Maberry. He's right up there with Stephen King, Dean Koontz, Richard Laymon, Jack Ketchum and all the other greats in the horror gendre. Ghost Road Blues will keep you turning pages way into the night, after which you will want to sleep with a light on!"
2,1 Star for Each Book You Still Have To Read Till The End,Johnathan Mayberry isn't a bad writer and the only reason I read it was because I loved the summary. But it's really an introduction. If you can get through all the pages of this book... There's still 2 to go.
4,ghost road,"This was a good book... Maberry has two books about this town, and they are both written about basically the same incident, just a few days different time frame. I made the mistake of reading #2 first so I was confused when I read #1 because it kept referring to stuff that I'd read in #2!! but they are both great books, just read them in order!this one first!!!"
4,Groovin' on Pine Deep,"This book is well-written and emotionally moving. The plot sags a bit towards the middle, but that can be attributed to this novel's status as the first in a trilogy. My only complaint: Maberry introduces too many of his characters too quickly, so that the book jumps around a lot rather than following just a couple of solid plots through from beginning to end. I look forward to the next installment."
3,"WELL WRITTEN & SCARY!! CHARACTERS SHOULD'VE BEEN WRITTEN WITH MORE ""SUBSTANCE"".","Ghost Road Blues had the potential to be much better reading than what it was. Don't get me wrong...I liked the book. But it's one of those I wouldn't really recommend to friends/family. One of the things I liked about the book was the fact that it took me down a road of horror I hadn't expected. The villains turned out to have a supernatural link. I was disappointed in the lack of character definition. You never really got to know these people you were rooting for...It was too lightweight in my opinion. I noticed there was some repetition in the book too, as if the writer either forgot he'd already written that part or he was trying to use up some more space. Anyway, this book is kind of like one of those one or two star horror movies that you watch once just for the heck of it, then forget it. Not real bad, but not real good either."
5,Great first horror novel,I started out reading the Joe Ledger novels which got me interested in Maberry'sother books. I found the first two books in the Ledger series to be fantastic. Ithink GHOST ROAD BLUES is a great first novel leaving me wanting to jump into thenext book in this series. I think the Ledger novels show how Maberry has grown asa writer from this first book. I plan on reading all of Maberry's work as soon asthey arrive in the mail.
4,very good book,I really enjoyed this book but it did have some flaws. For example it showed some physical child abuse and although that bothered me I couldn't help but feel angry at the way the cops simply shook their heads and did nothing. They would be legally obligated to report such abuse to the feds and the feds would probably take him to an orphanage and Vic no matter how well connected he is in a small town would go to prison. The mother would also get any parental rights she had removed.Other than all this I really enjoyed the book I didn't agree with the reviewer who complained that the evil spirit wasn't as evil as some of the humans. I think such complaints are silly and really who cares? What matters is I found it distinctly enjoyable and thought it had a lot of characters that I really enjoyed. It did go a little slow but the slow pacing seemed appropriate.
4,How Do You Walk the Walk You Talk?,The author reviews Ephesians in a systematic way that compares and contrasts words and in doing so portrays some significant Biblical Truths.
5,spirtitual growth,"I have read Ephesians many times. This time has been different. Ms. Arthur does a very nice job in this bible study. I am doing this study by myself and still have gotten so much out of it. When we call on the name of Jesus, we are to be different, set apart. I want my life to be different, and this study has helped me to grow."
3,Good Book Poor Kindle Version,"Good book for small groups, BUT Many typo's in the Kindle version. makes it very difficult to read and fallow along."
4,Extremely helpful,"This book was extremely helpful in my search for information in tying cast nets. It offers charts to keep things easy and smooth and the diagrams were great. It is a dying trade, and cast net making is something that should be kept around, because nothing makes a fella happier then when you have a massive cast net, made by your own hands, to show off, use and brag about."
5,Rock tahn projects musicina inner reality,"Kazuya Yoshii is now 40. He himself defines this album as the completion of his 30's. He is known for his versatility and always changing style. This album is a show case of his styles; glam-rock, melancholic Japanese pop, heavy-rock, party-tuen rock,etc.The album as all recorded in LA. You can find familiar names such as Julian Coryell on guitar , Josh Freeze on drum. As for sound you may find a happy marriage of dry US air in instrument and humid Japanese mood in vocal.Contrary to the lucidity of sound lyrics are symbolic enough to portrait a selfimage of a man going to be 40. Look at these expressions; peeling off anti-electricshock vinyl/ I want to get on the Ferris Wheal painted by Chagall/ to make my brain gel. A liitle knowlege of Japanese may add a differnt flavour to your impression on this album."
1,Not worth it...,Don't buy it. It's not worth your money. It only worked for 5 days then the top stop working....
1,do not buy this,I paid almost $300 for the max pool buster CG and it broke right after the warranty (after 1 year). It is poorly constructed and the seals leak and water got inside the electrical parts. I used it properly and used it exactly as instructed in the manual. At most I used it once a week during pool season so if I used it 25 times that would be the max. I would not buy this again.
1,NOT worth the money!,"I have the Pool Buster CG 'Gold' package. This is their best? DO NOT waste your money. No suction enough to pick up algae. Just brushes it around. Battery will not last an entire cleaning session. Charger goes off every two hours. Must reset to continue a charge. For the money, should be a 'trickle' charger. WAY TOO MUCH MONEY for this non-performer. You WILL regret it."
5,I love organic chemistry because of Ege's book.,"Of the several introductory organic texts available, Ege's is the best. The book stresses understanding mechanisms and learning how to break a ""scary-looking"" molecule into simple parts. Retrosynthesis is emphasized. The problems and examples chosen range from simple to practical. In particular, students of all disciplines can appreciate why chemistry is important -- whether it's biochemistry, materials, or environmental. Organic chemistry is taught like a puzzle rather than memorization of reactions. The book will teach you the thought process to solve these puzzles. Have fun!"
5,"Good book. Readable and complete, for first organic classes","I have read several texts in chemistry and engineering, and organic is not my favorite subject, but this is in my top three texts of all time. I recomend it esspecialy for those without P chem. This is a great first organic book and its contents are applicable for useages with more advanced classes. Any chemist or biologist could use a copy and the study problem guide is an assest worth the 40 dollors if this is a text for your class."
1,A waster of money,"This book is a total waste of money. Prices are way out of date.Buy Gary Kirsner's book ""The Mettlach Book"" if you want accurate descriptions, pictures, and prices."
1,BEWARE! amateur hour CDR/color xerox rip-off,"I have hundreds of Beatles tribute albums. THIS MAY BE THE WORST. The music is pretty much pointless...maybe ok for a bar band. It is a lot like those $3.99 Beatles tribute Cd's, only it costs four times that much. And, it's not a CD...it's a CDR. There is no art, no liner notes, only very shoddy color xeroxing for a cover and tray liner."
1,Self-involved tripe,"Ms. Gottlieb has suceeded only in writing a book that reveals more about the self-centered, whiny author than about the downfall of the company itself. If she was indeed a ""typical"" employee, then it's quite clear what ONE of the major problems was with the company.It's a shame too, because the story of the ""dot com bust"" is actually worthy of a well-researched dispassionate analysis. This is not it. It reads more like the rantings of a self-involved drama queen than the writings of an author with anything meaningful to say."
1,Uninformative and Unimaginative,"The Cult of Kibu is a slow painful read about the bygone times of the internet craze. The authors go through a pianfully boring and unfunny recollection of a world that is clearly something they are not familiar with. Having experienced the rush and been part of an internet company I would recommend ""Starving to Death on 200 million"" - it is a much more accurate and entertaining account of this time period...."
3,not as good as Williams version,"I love pinball. The Gottlieb collection includes a couple of machines I played when they were originally available. The tables and sounds are expertly recreated. The problem is the gamecube controller doesn't have the right feel. The physics are pretty good, but the original tables didn't have the best flipper action. The Williams collection from the same company is truly outstanding. This is only for the most diehard enthusiast and even then is unlikely to get put in your wii very often."
3,Not what I hoped,"Gottliebs Pinball Hall of Fame for GameCube leaves much to be desired. The picture clarity is average at best and the play of some of the pinball tables is lacking. For instance, Teed Off acts like the real game in that the ball can get stuck on the ramp or in one of the pop up holes and you need to tilt the game to get the ball unstuck. I didn't expect that and it ruins the enjoyment and play of the game. The older tables, Central Park and Ace High are rather lame. I do enjoy playing Big Shot, Victory, Genie, and Black Hole."
3,It's okay,"This game is fun to play pinball, but since it is the Hall of Fame edition, they are all old tables. Nothing new and flashy or extreme. Not what I was really looking for. I think the free one that used to come with windows was more fun. Don't get me wrong, I've spent plenty of hours playing it though."
2,Some recipes lack important ingredients,"Before making any one of these dishes, one should read through the recipe to make sure it makes sense. For example, the recipe for ""Chicken Stewed with Fennel, Tomatoes, and Saffron"" calls for major amounts of vegetables, plus 4 chicken legs with thighs. One is supposed to put all the ingredients in a glass bowl to marinade overnight. Please note, only one cup of liquid is used. How can one marinate all these ingredients in one cup of liquid? That's what I asked myself when I ended up with a huge bowl of ingredients and miniscule amount of liquid. Another questionable recipe is found on page 197, ""Couscous with Vegetables."" Here again, the recipe calls for sauteing a large amount of vegetables and seasonings with just one tbl. of oil and 2 tbls. of liquid. I would not recommend this book nor would I buy another book by this author."
3,Veggies Good!,"This book has excellent, and very creative recipies for the ""Almost Vegetarian"". It is a celebration of food as well as living healthy.If your goal is to be a vegetarian, you should have this book. It is very difficult to jump right into being meatless... especially in the fast food burger joint world we live in. This book can help you make the transfer, without going ""cold turkey"". It will retain usefulness even after you have stopped eating meat because most of the recipies are completely vegetarian, and all are very tasty."
2,The name of this book is the best part,"I was soooo hopeful when I got this book... seemed too good to be true, exactly what I was looking for... however...1) Many of the recipes take too long to make, are too involved for every day cooking, or are incomplete/not well thought out;2) The book is artistic looking but difficult to read - two columns on most pages and one recipe can be spread over multiple pages. The artist fonts and styles just make the book so busy to look at... I just kept getting discouraged.Man, it was a great idea, just not executed very well. I suggest looking at Vegetarian Express Lane Cookbook instead."
4,A GUIDE FOR LEGUME LOVERS,"Here's a guide for the increasing numbers who are opting to be vegetarians - most of the time.Many of the recipes that call for fish or poultry can be prepared with legumes instead. And, these dishes are not bland but tasty as well as nourishing.Included is a Fresh Vegetable Directory, containing descriptions of vegetables and how to select them in the market. You'll never confuse scallions and shallots again!"
2,"Too much time, too little flavor","I got this book because I wanted to be vegetarian for ethical reasons, not necessarily for health reasons. I have found that the recipes in this book skimp on fat in every ingredient which is great for those of you trying to lower your cholesterol, eat healthier, etc. But I found that these recipes take a good amount of preparation and end up tasting rather bland. I want my whole-milk cheese and butter back!"
4,Perfect information,I really loved this because the beginning introduction was about shopping for produce and how to do it right. The introduction also included the important of each fruit and vegetable.
4,Almost Vegetarian,What I like about this book is the information on how to purchase veggies. I don't buy new kinds of veggies because I'm a bit intimidated by it and I worry that I'm spending money on something that isn't fresh enough. It describes a fresh or a nonfresh veggie to help me at the produce section. I also like the explanation on how to use and prepare beans. I've only used canned beans and would like to use fresh ones and this has helped me start that.
2,Too much time!,The recipes in this book take entirely too much time tend to be bland. Other cookbooks that I own have similar recipes that take half the time. The results were very dissapointing.
4,More than a travelogue,An interesting and absorbing story about a life style centuries old that is on the verge of disappearing. Theresa Maggio writes beautifully and her affection for the setting she describes is obvious and contagious.The fishing details are fascinating but what resonates here is her love of the place and its people.
4,Love Sicily,"This is an interesting book about Sicilian Life and culture, and should be read by anyone who wants to learn more about Sicily."
3,interesting but overrated,This book has a special intrest for me as I am a commercial fisherman who lives on an island. This book unfortunately focused too much on Theresa Maggio and not enough on either the history or practice of fishing. Her writting style is excellent. Unfortunately the content is more sutitable for a magazine article than a book.
3,poor shipping,"I bought this as a gift for someone, but when I checked it out, it was broken from shipping...it was poorly packaged and loose in box. Otherwise, it's nice for the money..."
3,"Product good, but came Broken :(","The product was for my parents for christmas, so when I received it I didnt take the best look at it because I didnt want to take it out of the original packaging. When they opened it, it had broke on the bottom half of the long section that you attach to the wall. It wasnt a very noticeable break, but still made the product seem cheap. They didnt want to send it back, but if I purchase a product I dont want it to be broken when I get it. The rope wasnt connected to the bell portion either, but that information wasnt give either. My overall opinion of the product isnt bad, just mediocre, and I probably won't purchase this actual item for anyone else. But, the recipient of it did think it was nice even though it was broken."
3,San Francisco Indeed...,"This audio recording is actually taken from the Blue Line's performanceon the Ohne Filter TV show, Germany. It would be a shame for someone to spend a lot of money on this disc when they can simply listen to the DVD, which is currently available."
3,Wicked Widow,"Like some of the other reviews, I am saddened that the Amanda Quick books are beginning to become boring, with Wicked Widow barely making the mark. Yes, the Vanza reference is getting old very quickly. Also, the characters seem to argue most of the way through the book - that is tiring. Hopefully Amanda Quick books will get back on track to some of the more interesting ones of the early 90's, such as Ravaged and Mystique."
2,I would have liked it if I had never read Amanda Quick,"I happen to like Ms. Quick's writing, but it becomes monotonous after a while because she recycles the same exact plot with the same exact characters EVERY TIME. The man is always tall, controlled (too controlled), controlling, Vanza, and on the edge of society. The woman is alway seccentric in her own way, wayward, foolishly wayward, and a ""bluestocking."" The WICKED WIDOW concentrated on the heroine's distrust of Vanza too much. After ht efirst few pages, I was like, oh, no, not another, ""Vanza this, and it was because it was Vanza."" I'm sick of the heroines being virgins!!!!!!! The excerpt read so nicely, I tried to read it, but it was too drattedly rehashed that I coulnd't tak eit anymore and i threw it across the room."
4,Was a fun read!,"Classic Amanda Quick! If you enjoy her books, I highly recommend this one! It was fun to watch the wicked widow stalk about, I do wish she had been just a little bit more Wicked, but all in all, this is a classic romance novel and Amanda Quick is very good at putting them out in the universe."
1,Haven't I read this before?,"I have never knocked a Krentz/Quick book, despite the fact that some are far better than others. In this latest work (?) I couldn't help but feel I'd read this all before... several times. I wish the author would get off the one-dimensional Vanza characters and turn out the kind of page turning sizzle that I know she's capable of producing! Next time I'll wait for the paperback ... or borrow a copy."
2,"She's such a good writer, why is she recycling?","Amanda Quick can write such wonderful books, but sheesh! I am DONE reading about ancient civilizations and spunky Regency misses. I liked about ten of her books, loved three but lately it's the same old thing with different names. If this is your first Quick book, hurrah! you'll like it, just be warned that the last three or four are exactly the same story."
4,Typical Amada Quick,This is a typical Amanda Quick book. Good easy read. Would be a good summer vacation book for the beach.
1,Nothing to see here folks,"What has happened to Amanda Quick?! Her early work was just splended (worthy of keeper status) and now... I just can believe it's the same person.This was just awful. Vanza this, Vanza that. A wicked widow that wasn't, who also didn't seem to know how to keep the Vanza secrets, blurting information to our Vanza hero with her TSTL babbling. It's a pairing of two people who never seemed to mesh as a couple. Pepper in a little more Vanza. Have stupid dialog and even more ridiculous sex scenes add more Vanza and you come up with a tale that shouldn't have been told. Please don't waste your time or money on this lemon."
4,AQ--Very dependable!,"I've read all and re-read many of AQ's books and WW is firmly in the middle of the pack. Not as good as the first 5-6 (loved Scandal and Rendezvous) but much better than the subpar With this Ring and I Thee Wed. Still, with all of the derivative and half-hearted Regency out there, I will always buy AQ and know I'll get a quality story and wonderful entertainment. Only problem is . . . why can't she write as fast as Nora?!"
4,A hit for Quick,"I found this to be as well written as the other Amanda Quick novels that I read. She has a smooth style and does a great job developing her characters. This book had a very interesting story line. The extremely smart recluse and the Wicked Widow get together to solve a mystery and during their adventure, a romance blossoms. The romance is sweet not sappy and the mystery was entertaining. The only downfall was that near the end, the continuous reference to the Vanza society was getting overdone and therefore kept me from giving this book 5 stars."
4,Great Narration,I usually listen to audiobooks while I drive to and from work everyday. I was enjoying this one so much that I brought it in the house and found reasons to stay at the computer to listen to it. It was wonderful narration and the story was thrilling.
4,Loved it!,"This was my first Quick book, and I haven't been able to put down her books ever since. Imagine my surprise when I read her earlier work! This is no doubt a lesser book than her early efforts, but I still found it to be funny and intriguing. I do agree with another reviewer who said that the author used Vanza as an excuse for any inexplicable behavior the hero displayed. Vanza became more of a nuisance after a while, but the characters really kept me turning the pages."
3,"Wicked, not Wild","Ms. Quick's lastest is an interesting re-work of some of her favorite themes. Enjoyable, but nothing new for a die-hard fan. Enjoy the good read, but don't expect to find any new quirks to grab a hold of your interest."
2,Not interesting,"I think Amanda Quick has run out of story. By reading few pages of this book, I can guess the rest of the story. I think this book has all the combination of the last few books she wrote, you can find the similarity."
2,Disappointing,"The hero and heroine of Wicked Widow are clones of the same characters in her last book. Only the names have been changed. Amanda Quick's former witty style is missing. So is the romantic element, almost entirely. While I liked her last book more, despite the invention of an imaginary secret society called Vanza, in this book the Vanza element is so silly and annoying it spoiled the book for me. Can't her heros be competent without help and goofy secret arts? Quick can write good books when she wants to--this just isn't one of them. Maybe she's tired of being Amanda Quick.And why does the misleading author picture continue to appear on her covers? I've seen her and heard her speak, and that picture is either 30 years old or of someone else. There is nothing wrong with the way she looks now, and her publisher should call for an update."
1,Vanza Again!,"This book suffers from too much Vanza, and not enough character development of the herione. I've read every Amanda Quick and this one seems like a re-hash of one of her prior books."
3,No match to I thee wed,"This book was very clever in some of her plot twists, yet I 2 though it was a little over done in some parts. It a so so read, and yet again a classical Amanda Quick book and I believe that these characters are richer than some of her other ones. I think that both are deserving of each other."
2,I agree- it's just OK reading. There is better out there.,"This was my first Amanda Quick- and I wasn't impressed. It was dry and slow in places. I, too, got tired of Vanza this and Vanza that. It was overdone. As for the characters- I did like Artemis Hunt, owner of the Dreams Pavilion but there was something missing with Madeline ""The Wicked Widow"" Deveridge. And their romance was definitely flat and missing something (not that I want more description, but I did not feel the love there). I did finish the book but I won't suggest this one to friends."
2,Could the old Amanda Quick please come back?,"Having been an Amanda Quick fan from the beginning(Seduction is a wonderful book) I am saddened by the deterioration reflected in her last 4-5 books. Her earlier books were characterized by intricate plots and layers of character development. Her heroes and heroines had depth and in fact were people you wanted to invite for dinner. I stopped buying them( I get them from the library) several books ago. Having just read the Wicked Widow, I am now going to stop reading them.PS, is it my imagination or have all successful paperback authors undergone similar transformations as they move to hardback? Elizabeth Lowell is also quickly degenerating as well,"
3,It was OK,"It was OK. Not like her other books and it did not quite hold my attention. I could put it down and get back to it. It seemed that Madeline and Artemis met each other, searched for the bad guy, had sex, fell in love, thwarted the bad guy, and wanted to get married all in one day. Since I usually enjoy ready her books I will continue to buy her hard covers although the price seems awfully steep for this book."
1,Not Up to Snuff,"Having just finished re-reading Scandal, Desire, and Deception, I settled down with Wicked Widow with anticipation. Before the end of the first 100 pages, I was wondering if Amanda Quick was on sabbatical and a high school creative writing student had taken her place. Where, I wondered, is the richness and fun of her previous books? Reading Wicked Widow was like a eating a TV dinner when I expected at least a respectable repast. Compared to Quick's previous works, Widow is flaccid, catchpenny and slipshod. Where are her usually wonderfully developed characters? The satisfyingly thick plots with lots to chew on? By the time I finished it, I wanted to call up Jayne Krentz (the real Amanda Quick) and ask her ""WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?""As for the Wicked Widow, the Quick fan is better served going back to her previous novels, which are funny, romantic and fulfulling. Wicked Widow is not up to the Quick standard."
2,Don't waste your money,"Boring and weak is the best way to descibe this book. A rip off because this book could have very easily been sold in the paperbook mode and not the very expensive hardback. No need to review the book because if you have read her last two you will know the plot and the characters and of course the bad guy. Oh well, now I know that I will wait to purchase her next one after it becomes available in the paperback release. Better yet hit the library and save myself my hard earned cash."
2,Not worth the wait,Every year I eagerly await the latest addition to my Amanda Quick collection. This one was a disappointment. The whole Vanza angle has been exhausted. Character development was not as extensive as previous Quick works.Had a hard time finishing this one.
1,Do not waste your time,"I am a fan of Amanda Quick's . My favorite book is "" Rendezvous'. In "" Wicked Widow"" , there is nothing close to a relationship between the charactors.They are one dimensional. Perhaps Ms.Quick had a deadline to meet and had no choice, but, her fans deserve more than this offering."
3,NOT MS. QUICK'S WORST---,"This was certainly not Amanda Quick's worst book, so I personally don't get all the ""hate it"" reviews, but it was just an okay read. When the story started, it was a bit confusing, like I happened in on the middle of it--a bit of the ""Huh?"" factor. There was definitely an overkill on the Vanza theme (taught by the monks of Vanzagara)--sort of had shades of the old ""Kung Fu"" show, ""Choose wisely, grasshopper..."" Ms. Quick's books, RAVISHED and DECEPTION were so much better."
2,Other Amanda Quick books are SO much better,"So glad this wasn't the first AQ book I've read, or I would never have picked up another."
2,Check it out in the library!,"I was very diappointed with this book. Usually I can't put an Amanda Quick book down, and I read them over and over. Not so with this one. The characters are not as sharp and witty as in other Quick books. Vanza is WAY overdone here. There is very little sexual chemistry between the main characters.. and the ""scenes"" are not worth the pages they're written on."
3,"""Quick"" Read?","For the first time ever, I scanned a Quick book. I usually like her writing but this book never developed. She just hammered on Artemis being ""Vanza""...and never let the characters develop. She flirted with the possibilities, toyed with the reader, but in the end...I find that I just can't recommend this one."
2,Why can't she write like she use too?,"""Wicked Widow"" is the lastest book by Amanda Quick that I have read and she keeps getting it wrong. Madeline Deveridge is the ""Wicked Widow,"" a woman may have killed her husband. Artemis Hunt is a man who wants revenge. That join forcus that lead them down a very interesting path.Ms. Quick is just losing her touch on these book she just want to make these book mysteries and nothing else. I use to be a big fan of her books, but not anymore."
3,What happened to AQ?,"This book is a way to pass a few hours, but on the whole, not up to this author's potential. A one word description of the plot, characters, love scenes, and dialogue: competent. They get the job done, but lack the sizzle and interest that I used to expect in Quick novels. Unfortunately, this trend of blandness seems to be bleeding into AQ's other pseudonym writings as well. To find better examples of this author's work, look to the books that are titled using the same first letter (Mistress, Mystique, Mischief; Ravished, Reckless, Rendevous; etc). That's Quick at her best! I don't think she's finished out the alphabet yet. Maybe she'd consider going back to that project??"
2,Afraid I have to agree - this isn't her best,"Normally, I love the witty, funny style of this author - but this book just fell flat. The two main characters really didn't interest me and this Vanza stuff has got to go. I'm serious. To be frank - I won't buy another Amanda Quick until it's been out long enough for me to read the reviews on Amazon.Pass on this one"
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT...,I REALLY LOVE AMANDA QUICK'S EARLY BOOKS BUT HER NEWER BOOKS ARE JUST AWFUL AND I WANT TO LIKE THEM! WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THIS VANZA? THIS BOOK HAS AWFUL WRITING AND PLOT! I AM SO SORRY TO LOSE A FAVORITE AUTHOR! I GUESS I WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO HER OLDER TITLES TO ENJOY! SHE WROTE MASTERPIECES THEN!!:0)
3,"Not up to par, but still a good read.","I've read every book Amanda Quick has written and this one just isn't up to her usual standards. It's still an enjoyable read, but you might want to wait till it goes to paperback. There were one to many similararities to previous books of hers."
4,My first Amanda Quick,"This was my first Amanda Quick novel but, it will not be my last. I really enjoyed this novel. It had a unique plot that I found refreshing. It was a little heavy on the Vanza stuff. And I did not quite feel the attraction between the hero and heroine that I would have liked, hence the four stars instead of five."
3,INTERESTING TITLE,"Madeline Deveridge, believed by townspeople to have outstanding sexual prowess, has been given the nickname, WICKED WIDOW. In truth, Madeline lives a very quiet and almost spinster life with her beloved aunt.Due to recent events, Madeline believes that the ghost of her dead husband is haunting her, trying to steal a secret book, and planning her death. Her life is becoming unbearable because she's having nightmares and encountering unexplainable situations.She hires, by blackmail, the services of Artemis Hunt, a master of the Vanza secret society and owner of an illicit sex house. Madeline needs to find out what is going on with her dreams and the ghostly apparitions.Together Artemis and Madeline investigate the happenings, but their closeness creates romantic sparks where, along with discovering the truth, Artemis also finds Madeline is anything but the WICKED WIDOW.This book is OK, but somewhat dark, and at times unbelievable. It's not one of Ms. Quick's best."
3,Not up to her usual,"I am a fan of Amanda Quick's work and I couldn't wait for her next book. When this one came out I even bought it in hardcover, not wanting to wait for a paperback. But, I must say, it was nowhere near as good as her others. I was disappointed. Usually her female characters are witty, interesting, more innocent and charming. Her male characters are usually more self-assured, strong, and in command of their lives. I didn't like the obsessed nature of these characters. They were both rather whiney. Usually I laugh at the antics between the two lead characters, but not in this one. And I must agree that the constant mention of Vanza was really irritating. There was not the pleasant sense of suspense about the romance development. I hope her next is better. I will buy more of Amanda Quick's work, because she does have talant and I'm the hopefull type."
2,Didn't like it at all,"I had hopes for this book. I'm not usually an Amanda Quick fan, but I thought the concept for this book was interesting. Wrong. I thought it dragged on. It wasn't as suspenseful as I thought it would be, either. I know I won't be purchasing anymore by this author."
2,It Not Her Best,I wasn't very fond of this book. The plot was very thin. I look forward to the next Amanda Quick book.
4,A Classic Work Which Deserves Its Status,"This book is a true guide for a wide range of collectors, and would be collectors. I am impressed with its layout, which facilitates the very dense amount of knowledge being offered by Mr. Levine. Seldom have I seen a book of over 500 pages that actually seems to convey more information than its page count would suggest.In other words, if you are really interested in knives at all you ought to own this well crafted book. Why not all 5 stars? My only real criticisms are that some of the graphics should be better and the paper used is poor, (perhaps these two items are related).Anyway, great book, buy it, you will never regret it."
2,Wheres the Beef?,"Maybe calling this the ""stripped down for racing version"" would have been more appropriate. It certainly isn't the family station wagon, full of Knife Information, that it was before Krause slashed all the pertinent data out of it. The 5th Edition is a classic case of creating a new version just for the sake of sales. That may not have been so bad, except they removed much important data which knife collectors use to identify and collect knives. Then, to make it appear they had changed it, they added superflous ""bloatware,"" in an effort to make it look different. If Levine's 4th Edition didn't exist, it would be better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick, but you can still get the 4th Edition so that option can be avoided. One of the major facinations of old knives is their level of handmade quality. The historical record tells us that newer is not always better."
1,Hack Job,"Publishing has sunk to a new low with this edition. Levine had nothing to do with it, and the publisher hired some dealer to give prices made from thin air. Save your money and buy the 4th edition again. The 4th edition remains the standard in the hobby."
4,the bible of knife collecting !,"Well worth the investment for a serious collector, or even someone who is considering starting a collection, it is jam packed with everything you need to knowabout different makers, their history, tang stamps and popular patterns, collecting trends and how to display your collection and more !! Don't Bother with the NEW5th Edition, the format changed and is not as good as the earlier 3rd and 4theditions. (I couldn't find a used 4th edition, so I got a 3rd) (The only differenceis in price valuations which have gone up and down as of lately.)If you only have enough money to get one good knife book, this one will do nicely."
2,A disappointing Doc Ford,"This book is a ""Formula Ford"" - same old plot, and I'm beginning to think that Ford is really promiscuous. If you like loads of detail about GPS, ocean tidal movement, and other minutiae, this is for you. The plot gets too bogged down and hard to follow, but Mr. White's vocabulary continues to impress. I will probably pass on the next one."
2,His worst by far,"... I used to love this series, but in the past few books, it's grown more outlandish, improbable and repetitive. The plot is absolutely predictable, and the author has seemingly decided that he has to keep good old Doc Ford the same from book to book. A lot of writers have made the same mistake (Jeremiah Healy, Sue Grafton...). Contrast this with the way John Sandford or Robert Crais keep their characters fresh--by having them grow, change and develop. What this means for Doc Ford is that anybody who might represent a love interest has to either leave him, be revealed as a lesbian, or die. In addition, the dialogue in this one is so sappy and overly sentimental that I winced when reading it. I hope that Randy Wayne White gets back to the tight plotting of the first few books of the series."
3,"Same old, same old","I love Doc Ford books, but this one was a disappointment. Same visit to South America, same romance with girl who he does not get, same, same, same."
2,Too much macho details,"I was interested in his work as a biologist on Sanibel Island, but the narrative was more about international intrigue and the alphabet soup of agencies."
1,no john mcdonald,"This is my first look at this author, and the last, I'd read in several places that his work fell into the John D. McDonald category. Not even close. I've read all McDonald's work and this author has a long way to go. Perhaps more like Tom Clancy, where I've always gotten bogged down in endless technological detail and cannot finish the book. The characters seem caricatures and not interesting humans, even the inhuman humans."
5,DOC FORD # 9,"TWELVE MILE LIMIT is #9 in the Marion Doc Ford series and for fans it is another good one. If you are new to Doc Ford, go back and star at the beginning. The characters are richer if you read this wonderful series through. All of Randy Wayne White's book are great reads, easy and fun with great dialogue and always plenty about Florida. This story opens up more of Doc's past and sends us to South America, Columbia to rescue a female friend and to confront the bad guys. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
3,The Good and the Bad,"This my first RWW. The good: pretty good story. Some nifty techno-info about GPSes, ocean currents, stuff like that. Okay characters; one cares about them.The bad: the narrator, Doc Ford, is a brazen knock-off of Doc in Steinbeck's Cannery Row. And the book is badly overwritten, circuitous, filled with extraneous stuff, lots of useless political material. It gets sloooooow. 100 pages could be taken out to good effect.I might pick up another one."
5,The master of mystery with a little history,"I have read all of Randy Wayne Whites books and Twelve Mile Limit is no exception to the rule. West coast Florida adventure bleneded in with the biting edge of crime . Believable and keeps you on the edge of your seat.With the dark side of Columbia this book, like his others, draws you into the adventure and every step the writer takes, you take with him. Excellent read."
5,always great - 6 stars!,"I have reviewed 1 other RWW book and as before I think he is one of the best writers today! If I could give this book 6 stars I would.I can hardly say enough good things about him (no I'm not related, workfor his publisher or know him)This book has action, emotion, philosophy, frienship, tragedy,and anopportunity to learn a few things.His characters seem real & truly diverse. At this point they seem like oldfriends to me.(I am reading them in order - this is book #9)His writing is easy to read yet often covers challenging topics to write about or normally difficult to describe. I never feel like I am readingjust enjoying a good story.His plot is never predictable and always has a twist or turn you just don't see coming.He is one of only a few 6-star writers I have ever read."
4,"A good read, but not White's best","Fans of Randy Wayne White will not be disappointed by Twelve Mile Limit, another of his ""Doc Ford"" series, although it is not his best work.The plot revolves around the real-life mystery of a sinking of vessel over the Baja California, a 1940's wreck off the gulf coast of Florida and the disappearance of several of the tourists on board. White then weaves his familiar brand of mystery, political commentary and action in a thrilling story.However Twelve Mile Limit is not White's best work. I was disappointed by his inclusion of a manage a tois and the somewhat familiar ""drug-dealers and white slavers"" in South America theme. The book would have been good - maybe better - without them. Nonetheless, it is an enjoyable and fast-paced read, made all the more riveting by the true-mystery flavor to it."
4,Entertaining Though Familiar,"For Doc Ford fans, this is a familiar and entertaining tale. My only frustration was at the point that the plot jumped to South America and I had a flash of ""same plot, different day."" Evil drug-running bad guys snatch someone near and dear, Doc decides to singlehandedly make the rescue, reluctantly brings a tagalong, tragedy strikes but the bad guys ultimately pay.I enjoy Doc Ford's adventures more when they stay close to home. Maybe a good anti-developer story is due..."
2,Not for me,"Well, I d/l'd the free sample, that was enough for me. Not saying he isn't good, only that it's not for me. Too much discussion about things I have no interest in knowing about...but if you like it, well, press on. The writing style is good, best I can tell."
2,good plot - too much rambling,"Read this book, decent plot decent facts, but man is there some filler in this book that makes it almost painful to read...I skipped some pages entirely and kept right along with the book...the kicker for me was the line where the lost male diver harkens back to his days as an assistant junior varsity football coach to summons up his motivational skills...assisstant JV coach, come ondecent plot, way too easy help from the Spooks, but I am going to try some more of his earlier novels, hopefully they are more plot and less sap...if you are into reading flowing descriptions of everything including buddhist ways, then grab this book...if you are looking for heartier book...search his earlier pieces"
2,Is not ergo!,"I just bought this mouse yesterday and already my hand is feeling the pain. The way its set up it forces your hand to sit with your palm not resting on it. Basically your finger tips are holding your hand. In its defense, I can see that maybe a smaller hand would fit it better, but at the same time, I don't have very large hands.I'm returning it today and going to try to find one closer to the fit of my old MX-700 which has a great fit anf feel."
2,Not for the Mac,"If Logitech has customer service I couldn't find it. I had to return this mouse because it would not hold its settings. Having a lot of buttons would be great if they worked. I would set them, they would work, until the next time I turned the computer on."
1,Nice feel but freezes each time after a short interval,"I really like the feel of this mouse and it worked well for a couple of months. Now, when I turn the computer on it will work for a short interval and then freeze up until I turn the computer on again. I've tried plugging the USB micro-receiver into different high speed USB ports and even replaced internal USB ports thinking that might be the problem. To no avail. Unfortunate as I really like using the mouse when it works."
3,"Great mouse, shame about the OS X Driver","Can't really add much to the reviews posted here. The mouse does what it says on the box: it's extremely comfortable, the additional buttons aid in productivity and the wheel's free-flowing option makes scrolling through docs and websites much easier.HOWEVER, for Mac users the Logitech LCC software is an abomination. It's been written in an archaic manner that will often find your Mac's built-in fans kicking-in to maximum after a short time. But all is not lost: around twenty bucks gets you a third-party mouse driver (choose from SteerMouse, USB Overdrive or ControllerMate). After getting rid of the Logitech software and installing (in my case) Steermouse, the MX Revolution works perfectly.(Mac)Buyer be warned: factor in another twenty bucks for software that should have been included in the first place."
2,I've built up a solid hatred for Logitech products,"This mouse was one of the main reasons. At the time of purchase, it was $80 retail and I figured 'you get what you pay for'. It has a very nice feel to it, the buttons are useful, no wires... but accuracy? UGH! I had this thing for maybe a month or 2 before it would skip like crazy. I checked to see if there were hairs or fuzz in front of the laser, dirt on the mousepad, anything... but no luck. This thing would randomly make the cursor leap across the screen. It would also randomly disconnect from my computer and I'd have to reset it to link back (I have a Mac). I would not recommend it, nor any other Logitech product unless you are a lucky person."
1,Great Mouse...Horrible Product Support,"Buyer beware. This mouse is great and well worth the price...as long as you keep your receiver out of harms ways. Should anything happen to it you should be aware that Logitech just simply can't replace it. No way. No how. Eventhough they manufacture, market and sell this product somehow the receiver component is not within their power to replace. According to the Logitech rep it's ""impossible to replace"". They will, however, sell you a refurbished mouse & receiver for 50% off the MSRP(not the purchase price) plus tax and shipping & handling. Even if you purchase this product for only $79.99 you'd still have to pay 50% of $99.99 to get a refurbished replacement. Once you add on tax and shipping and handling you might as well go buy a brand new mouse. I really like this mouse but it's not worth $160."
5,"precise, just the right kind of buttons/wheels",This is hands down the best mouse I've ever used. I've been using mice since using a Mac+ and Amiga in the mid 80s. The scroll wheel alone is worth the price.
5,as good as it gets -- oh yeah!,"I did a bit of research and decided to go for the MX.Installation from a previous Logitech cordless from 2005 was a breeze. I actually let the MX charge fully before I installed the drivers. This is how you should treat any gadget with a battery.I love how this device feels in my hand... just right, not too big, not too small and I have average sized hands. I absolutely LOVED the scroll wheel. I handle documents and webpages that are hundreds of pages long - 300 pages on average -- and now I just fly with this baby!!! whoo hoo. Highly recommended. Life is good, short, and there is no reason not to have the best mouse in your hands, this is the full monty, the real mccoy, the royal flush of mice!"
4,Satisfied,"Nice features. Works as described. Scrolling using the free spin setting is not as smooth as it should be. Unlike some other laser mice, this mouse does not reset its position or behave irratically when moving quickly across the screen. The mouse is quite accurate, though it occasionally jumps/skips. With moderate use--nights and weekends--the recharable battery lasts me ~15 days."
3,"Good mouse, bad software","I owned this mouse for more than a year now, i bought it from Amazon. The mouse has great potential. However, the logitech software is crappy and bloated like all their other software. While all the features work as described, it has a large penalty on the system performace. Since I installed the mouse and logitech webcam, my laptop got slower considerably. The software wants to run 5 other supporting pieces which have no business being there.This mouse is definitely not worth it because of the bulky software logitech gives us. I would recommend a simple bluetooth mouse, if you have bluetooth on your computer/laptop."
5,Logitec MX Revolution Cordless Mouse,I bought this mouse to replace the cordless mouse I got with my computer. This one is much more comfortable and fits my hand better. It is smooth and so far the battery life has been excellent. It has a stand to put it in and recharge it---no issues so far. It came with software to allow you to customize settings but I have not had time to do anything but charge the unit and use it. It was just that easy. I did a bit of research and I'm pleased with my purchase.
4,"MX Revolution, better than i imagined.","The MX Revolution by Logitec, fulfills all of my requirements when it comes to a mouse. easy to become familar with and use right from the start, which is probably due to how comfortable it fits in your hand. the various buttons for page scrolling, document flipping, as well as the back and forward buttons for web pages, are at your finger tips.the rechargable mouse slips easily in to it's recharging stand, and within an hour or so the mouse is fully recharged. much better than the two batteries my old wireless would burn through about every 45 days, and always at the wrong time.great product, highly recommend the MX Revolution to anyone. i can't imagine why you would need anything else, this does it all, with ease."
3,A Nice Mouse but Over-Priced,"The mouse is very comfortable in the hand. The rechargeable feature is really why I bought it, but it runs down very fast, so you have to remember to keep it in the charging cradle when not in use.The only thing I don't like about it is the page-scrolling button. It is cumbersome to have to push down on the wheel before it will scroll the way I want it to. I do think the mouse is way overpriced."
5,Mx Revolution Cordless Mouse Rocks,"The mouse works accurately on many different surfaces. It is also very comfortable. Being able to switch the speed and resistance on the scroll wheel is probably the best feature, although there are lots of other programmable buttons (search, PageUp/Down...). Scrolling through web pages and long documents with this freewheeling mouse is a breeze!"
5,"The best mouse on the market, hands down!","Have been using the MX 1000 laser mouse for 2 years and have had nothing but great experienses with it. However, it came time to upgrade my OEM mouse at work (uses batteries..ugh!) so...I'm using the 1000 at work and this new MX Revolution at home. Great tool. Some useful added features ie. HyperScroll, Bluetooth! However I also bought the diNovo Edge keyboard and have little use for this outstanding mouse. Still my wife uses it and says the response is better than the IR connectivity of the 1000. TGF Bluetooth! Laser point accuracy is a must for photo enthusiasts. Logitech Set Point software is a great plus in keeping your equipment up to date and you informed as to the status (charging level) of your devices. Get one you won't be dissapointed!"
4,Needs to be more customizable,"The ONLY button that can be set as Middle is the scroll wheel, which doesn't click as well as other wheels.The second wheel doesn't scroll, it rocks, and can only be set as document flip or zoom. It can be depressed as a button, but isn't customizable.Back and forward don't work like normal, some programs behave differently (or not at all) with the buttons used for it.The search button can't be assigned to all the functions available to back, forward, and wheel tilt.The older mice were much better when it comes to customization."
3,Watch out with laptops,"I have used this mouse at work with Apples and it is great. I decided to buy one for my laptop at home and it didn't work. The mouse does not work with many laptops, according to their tech support team. In fact, I have had similar problems with other Logitech mice and will no longer buy them. I'm told the simplest ones should be OK. I have a Dell Inspiron 6000, about two years old and not exactly an odd duck. When they work, they are great. Maybe yours will work?"
5,Best mouse till date from Logitech,"I am software professional who use mouse for 8-9 hours a day for work. So you can imagine how much work we have to take from little puppy. I had 510, Media, V450, wired mini notebook mouse, MX 1000 laser mouse (died on me after 1 year of heavy use) and now MX rev, which is above all in feature set and performance. You have to download new version of setpoint to take advantage of new features. Scrolling button can be silent or click type, search button on top, left and right scroll, side wheel and many other config button makes it top choice."
1,Ridiculously Expensive.. and now its broken..,8 months ago time it was $100 + tax. OK.. should be cool enought.. its 100 bucks!!!.. I bought it. Liked it a lot.. very comfortable.. but now its in the trash.. doesnt work.. I dont know what broke it.. the receiver doesnt catch the mouse signals.. dunno whats wrong.. will buy a simple $15 mouse now..
1,Not Mac Compatible.,Do not get this mouse if you want to use it with a Mac.The software for the mouse is nothing but headaches.
1,the laser is dead,"I got this mouse one month ago, was working great. However, just about a month later, the laser stops working. I was so disappointed. I sent it back to repair. hopefully this time will give me a ""working"" one.this is a very bad experience with Logitech."
1,Nice mouse but don't lose your USB receiver!,I won't repeat all the glowing praise for the mouse. It really does a nice job but BE WARNED! - if you lose your tiny little USB receiver - you have to buy a new mouse. Logitech does not sell the USB receivers as replacement parts. They did offer to sell a refurbished mouse and receiver for 1/2 price with no warranty. Hang on to the USB Receiver or buy a cheaper mouse!
1,No middle click. Avoid this product.,"Does not have middle click, indispensable function for tabbed browsing. You can assign it to pressing the wheel in setpoint, but it is absolutely unreliable. You cannot assign (and will not be capable in the future also, logitech support assures me) middle click to left-wheel, right-wheel or ""one-touch search"" in setpoint (an ABSURD limitation, what where they thinking?????). How can they pretend to sell a mouse that fails in a so basic function? moving the mouse, right, middle and left click are the absolute basic functions that any mouse MUST support today in windows or linux."
5,Better than expected,"Precise movement, excellent ergonomics, fully costumizable buttons, and in my case that uses one mouse in the desk and a bluetooth mouse on the go. The Logitech software allows me to have diferente configuration for each one"
1,Revolution has poor performance,"This Logitech Revolution mouse is a high tech device that is the worst mouse I have ever used. All the functions work as advertised. What is bad is the Logitech driver software. My computer has an Intel Dual core CPU at 2.33GHz performance. I am using WinXP. The performance is so bad that the computer is often 3 or 4 clicks behind. Often, the computer does not respond to 3 or 4 clicks at all. This Revolution mouse replaced a Logitech MX Laser mouse that had similar problems but not as bad. I assumed (my bad) that a newer mouse would have superior performance. When installing the new mouse, I discovered that both mice used the same software. The mouse may be great but the Logitech software is totally poor. I would not recommend this trash or any other cordless Logitech device to my worst enemy."
4,great mouse,"This is a great mouse, great sensitivity, ergonomics are amazing, and decent battery life. However, I must admit that on a home theater setup and using a di novo edge keyboard, I rarely use a mouse anymore. However, if I do any serious work, the mouse is essential. Battery life is amazing, I think I recharged once in a month with minimal usage. I am not one to use extra buttons, but people may find them useful."
5,Great input device,"The name is apt: this is a revolution in mousing.Generally, I divide the world into keyboard types (like myself - for example, I remember all of the arcane keyboard shortcuts necessary to move around in MS Excel spreadsheets without ever touching the mouse) and mouse types (sticking with the Excel example, it _pains_ me to watch people use the mouse to manipulate a spreadsheet).With this mouse, however, I find myself becoming a much more prolific mouse user, because of all of the shortcuts that it gives me while I am reading or shopping online. The gains in productivity and efficiency that it provides are surprisingly high - and reason enough to buy it!"
3,"Expensive, Flawed, But Best?","I've had this for quite a while and it's worked really well generally-speaking. The cursor would occasionally jump, but nothing serious. Overall, I love the design and ability to customize - altho not as good when I run Mac OS.Lately, however, the mouse has been getting quite flaky. The cursor jumps a lot and worse, a single left-click is often taken as a double. It's become too frustrating to use.After surveying the landscape, I think I'll end up biting my tongue, digging deep and buying another one of these expensive babies (maybe refurbished). It still seems to be the best wireless mouse - for me anyway - but the quality control really should be much better for the price."
5,Best mouse.... Ever,"Simply put, this is the best mouse on the market.The cursor never gets lost.Very easy to use with a lot of extra functions not found on typical mice.For example:You can go back & forth on web pages using the buttons on the mouseAccess your favorite search engine through the mouseZoom in & out of web pages ( font size ) with the mouseAdditionally, and best of all, the mouse gives me no trouble ... no cleaning, no lost cursors, no getting angry at the mouse : )The only negative I can find is that it takes about an 90 minutes or so to charge the mouse... One charge lasts me about 3,4 days.The mouse's sensitivity and functionality is so great I can even surf the web and run the mouse over my little toy poodle dog... Now that speaks volumes about how great this mouse is , don't you think so?So move along, get one so you can be happy, too , and finally get a mouse that works great without problems : )"
5,Great Mouse,"I was looking for a good ergonomic mouse for some time because I often experienced hand pain from mouse usage. I was excited when I found out about this mouse on BF because it was an ergonomic mouse for a great price. I tried to buy this mouse on BF and my order was cancelled due to the BF fiasco. Eventually, Amazon was kind enough to honor their BF price.I haven't had any problems since I started using this mouse. The mouse is very comfortable to use and my hand hasn't hurt at all. I haven't had problems with skipping and the battery life has been pretty satisfactory.If there were to be a con, I would have to say that I wish there was a better way to set the orientation of the mouse. However, it could just be that I haven't looked in the right place to set the orientation. Overall, I am very happy."
4,Cordless mouse,Good cordless mouse.Suits the hand good.Not the best for gaming but it works fine.The battery time i wish was higher but its not bad either.If you want a good cordless mouse this is it!
2,Fast scroll and task flip both have problems,"Things i don't like about this mouse:1. the automatic fast scroll works beautifully in Internet Explorer, but only ""OK"" in Firefox.2. The automatic fast scroll works sporadically in other apps such as Word. In fact the only place the fast scroll works reliably well is in Internet Explorer, which i don't use.3. The thumb ""wheel"" is positioned too far forward. I have average size hands.4. The thumb ""wheel"" is ergonomically uncomfortable. I think a flatter button would be more comfortable.5. The thumb ""wheel"" is too hard to push / rotate.6. The thumb ""wheel"" just has a mushy feel to it.I am disappointed overall with the mouse because i was hoping the task flip wheel / button whatever would speed up my production."
5,This is the best,"This is the most comfortable, feature full and high quality mouse I ever used, and I've been using them a very long time! It feels like high quality, which it certainly is. It fits the hand perfectly and in the correct position and can be programmed to do all kinds of tricks very easily. This is the end of mouse searches for me.April 22, 2009: Now that some time has gone by I find the battery is not as long lasted after a charge, but it's still plenty satisfactory, and this mouse is just as good as I thought earlier. However, that prompted an inquiry by me investigating changing the battery should it become necessary, only to learn it can not be changed. Further, the factory won't either it seems. So if and when the battery does wear out from use, which it will most likely in time, I'm told purchase of a new mouse will be required. This, I do not like at all about this unit."
1,Amazon cancel my ordered,"Amazon cancel my order for this one and still as me to review it. Never a have a chance to use it. I am a believer in second chance; so Amazon, this is strike ONE for you."
1,Costs a 100 $ yet requires USB port plug in,"I am giving it 1 star only. That may be too harsh, but I was specifically looking for a mouse that connects directly to my pc without the need of a USB port plug in. There is nothing on the package that suggests that you would need to use a USB receiver, which is typically the case for the lower end mouses.I fail to understand the logic of this. It's probably an old design, that's why...."
4,Very good mouse,"I tried out several mice and ended up purchasing this one, and I'm pretty happy with it. It beats other PC mice hands-down, and Apple mice aren't worth it because they refuse to offer more than one button. The free-spinning scroll wheel alone makes it a very useful tool.Cons: a bit of difficulty sometimes trying to make slight moves, recharge required now and then, no Bluetooth."
1,STAY AWAY from this mouse,"I WAS a Logitech fan. After many years of using one of its firts cordless optical mouse with no problem at all, I decided to buy the ""best"" Logitech mouse available and bought this one. The LAG/FREEZE problem many people have spoken of is TRUE. I am running my mouse in a Dell Dual Core PC with Vista Windows Ultimate and the PC is right next to me so it is not that the PC is away from the mouse. The lag/freeze issue is unbearable and I can not accept it in a product this expensive and made by such a great (?) company as Logitech. So after one year using it with the same problem I just throw it to the garbage and bought a Microsoft Wireless Laser Mouse 6000 that has been working flawlessly. Oh, one more thing, the issue about the POOR DURATION of the battery is also true."
2,Not good for CAD/Too big,"Mouse looks promising by the description, but if you're using CAD, it's not for you...too many buttons. Also, if you do not have large hands, it becomes very uncomfortable after a couple minutes. I returned it 15 minutes after receiving it."
3,Battery Issues,"I bought this in January 2007, it worked great as advertised! I've always trusted Logitech products and they have great customer service. The mouse was worth the price I paid for, however, since early this year, it's been disconnecting at random times and the battery is no longer accurate. Now I can't even charge the battery. It has a three year warranty, so I'm covered and I should be getting it fixed or replaced."
5,FAST SCROLL,"This mouse responds fast to everything! Really fast scroll to go through a long page or document. Very comfortable in the hand. Don't even feel yourself holding it. I love the one button google search feature, as I am ALWAYS looking up something on google. You can also change that default to a different search engine if you choose. You won't be disappointed in this mouse. Seems to me, it is hard to find ones with the recharging station. I have to have this feature as I hate changing the battery all the time. This is a must have feature and this mouse has it!"
5,Best Mouse,"I purchased this mouse w/ the specific need of doing analytical reporting for work. This mouse has proven to be the best mouse I have ever used. The Hyperscrolling is amazing, I can fly down thousands of rows in a spreadsheet literally in seconds. I like the functionality of free scrolling or click by click scrolling as well since both are better to use during use of certain applications. It is incredibly comfortable. The one touch searching is awesome as well. Overall Logitech has made the best mouse around, I would not have purchased it if there was a better one out there. So if you cruise through web pages or documents or spreadsheets a lot this would be the best choice for you. The price may seem a bit high but trust me, for everything this mouse does so easily, it's worth it!!! Great job Logitech and thank you Amazon for selling it."
4,"I like it, even if not perfect.","Very comfortable to use all day. I always thought that my old Logitech mouse was good, but this one improves on it.Compared to my old mouse, there is one odd layout issue. My hand is large, but I never thought it was unusual. With this mouse, I can barely touch the thumbwheel when my fingertips are on the buttons. Fortunately I don't really have a use for the thumb wheel. The default document flip doesn't work as well as the Alt-tab does when you have 30-40 windows open.Even after a couple weeks, I'd have a hard time going back to a mouse without the dual-mode scrolling. That is beautiful.My only real problem with this is that Logitech seems to consider it a disposable item. The lifespan of lithium-ion batteries is well documented to be 2-3 years. Logitech states that once the batteries fail, they can not be replaced, and the mouse must be disposed of. What's wrong with using replaceable batteries?"
1,Horrible Ergonomics of Logitech MX Revolution,"After using this mouse for three weeks at work, my conclusion is that this mouse's ergonomics are horrible. I have average size hands and my pinky and ring finger ache from use of this mouse because the surface area on top is not wide enough and the curve off the right side is so abrupt and at a funny angle. Very disappointed in this mouse and will be purchasing another more traditionally shapped mouse."
4,Too hight tech for me,"Over the last five years I've bought scores of woodworking and computer gear from Amazon. They're the best. I love this mouse. Only problem is it made my computer very unstable. I'm using it with my laptop, which, so far, is o.k. The mouse itself is ingenious. The problem is that the software conflicts with my Windows XP."
3,Great features - Poor Ergonomics,"I like the features on this mouse and am keeping it. Yet, I find it hard to believe that a company that has been making computer peripherals for so long, can't do a better job on ergonomics, regardless of hand size.Positioning the mouse for optimum use of the top buttons and scroll wheel moves your thumb away from the application switching wheel.The application switching wheel is located too far way from the ""front"" and ""back"" buttons, and moving your thumb from the buttons to the wheel forces the mouse to move because of where the back of the mouse sits relative to the base of your thumb.I wear a men's large size glove. I would guess that that if your hand is smaller than this, you might find the positioning of the controls more awkward.I'd love to be able to talk to the mouse's design team to try to figure out why they did not make what would appear to be some simple adjustments that would have enhanced the mouse's usability."
4,A great mouse.,"Plenty of the reviews here provide the good information. The bad, at least for me, include plastic wearing/peeling and the lack of a removable battery.This is still a great mouse nonetheless."
1,Be aware of battery issues,"I've never written a review here at Amazon, but I felt compelled to let other potential buyers know what they *might* experience if they buy this mouse.Before buying, please be aware of the (reasonably common) issues with the built-in rechargeable batteries in this mouse. Go to the Logitech forums (forums dot logitech dot com) and read what issues people have been having with the batteries (inability to recharge, frequent loss of mouse precision due to battery issues, etc).Don't get me wrong: this is a lovely mouse, truly well designed and a joy to use when it's working. Unfortunately, there's an apparent flaw in the battery charging system that makes some mice unusable.Until Logitech either issues a recall or openly admits that there's a quality control issue with the MX Revolution, I'd suggest anyone seriously reconsider purchasing this mouse."
1,"Unless your computer is right next to it, forget it.","I have my tower on the floor to my left. I mouse right-handed. The mouse signal has to cross only a monitor and a couple of small speakers to reach the teeny tiny USB key that is the receiver. This receiver must be plugged into a motherboard-based port, and I couldn't put it on a USB extention cable, or a hub. The mouse would hang, jump, and jitter across the screen.The ""solution"" offered by tech support? Uninstall SetPoint 3.01. I returned the mouse and went back to my MX1000.Unless you're using it with your computer right on the desk, or on a laptop, it's not worth your time."
4,Somewhat Decent Mouse,"First off the software that come with this mouse enhance the convenience of this mouse by letting you set the function of the buttons to do different jobs base on the program you current have open, for example, a single button my have different function in microsoft word than it does in media player. the next good thing about it is the range of the connectivity with a tested distance of 15ft away from the receiver. also it is not necessary to use the receiver as the mouse can connect directly to your computer bluetooth.Now this is not a half bad mouse, i did have a some issue with the first one that i purchase but send it back and got a new one. so far im not having the same connective problem i did with the first one. another noted problem is the battery life which started at 14 days to 1 day fully chargedBut still i would recommend this mouse to anyone"
2,Not So Good In the Long Run,"I bought two of these units about two years ago... I liked their design and performance. Unfortunately, one of them will no longer take a charge in its charger and now I notice the second one is not holding a charge either. I leave them in their chargers all night and most of the day when I'm not actually using the mouse... so, since I can't replace the batteries, I guess I'll have to toss about $120.00+ dollars worth of mice away and buy something else. Like I said, I liked the design and performance but they have not stood the test of time... and it seems quite odd to me that they would both fail at about the same time.Doug Brown."
4,Can it hold a charge?,"This mouse is great. The responce time and accuracy are simply amazing. I enjoy the frictionless scroll feature, and the side scroll, and the automatic explorer button is one of the best features ive ever had in a mouse. If you normally have more than 4 windows open like i do, then it makes switching between them a sinch.Lots of mice this complex cause you to make many annoying mistakes that kill the overall value of the mouse. Not this baby, its fast and sure.My only problem seems to be with the charge. although it hasn't died on e, ive gone from 4 to 2 bars in about 4 days, although i constantly leave it on. so i do put it on the charger before i go to work or sleep every 5 days or so. But im just happy i don't have to buy batteries."
4,Caused wrist problems - otherwise awesome,"Make no mistake, this is a very nice mouse. I don't even have Windows XP, so I can't install the driver to use most of the features. The thing I love about it is the free-spinning scroll wheel. It is so nice to quickly scroll through a long spreadsheet, document, or web page - you just give it a spin and sit back and watch.However, I am going to have to get rid of it because it is causing sharp pains in my wrist. I even went to the doctor, fearing it was carpal tunnel. He diagnosed it as tendinitis. I suspect the problem lies in the area of the mouse where you place your thumb. It is curved into the side, which results in your thumb being in a very unnatural position. I have large hands, which may contribute to the problem... I plan to replace it with either an ergonomic mouse or a trackball, but I am definitely going to find something with a free-spinning scroll wheel."
4,Excellent Mouse,"Im not sure what all to say. I like the scrolling, i like the smoothness of the movement when using this mouse. The ergonomics are good. I highly recommend. The only recommendation i have is the ability to use the same nano USB with this mouse, my nano and keypad."
3,Not compatible with Windows 8,"Excellent mouse with Windows 7. Just upgraded to Win 8 and much to my chagrin, all the mouse's features are useless. Only left and right click work. I spent over an hour on the phone with Logitech customer support to no avail. I hope that Logitech is able to update their drivers to make their hardware fully compatible with the new OS."
5,Best Mouse Ever Made by Logitech,"I am sad to see this mouse reach such an expensive price. And sadder that Logitech has stop manufacturing it. This is THE BEST mouse I've ever had. It's been with me for over 5 years and just now it's starting to die on me, slowly but surely. I will recommend this mouse to anyone."
2,Excellent mouse with one major flaw,"When I first received this mouse, I was extremely excited to try it out. I installed the SetPoint software, plugged the USB stick in, turned the mouse on, and out of the bottom of the screen pops a message that the batteries are critical. I set it into the charger only to find that it won't charge. At all. It looks as if it is charging (Green bars light up) but then, a red light flashes indicating it isn't charging. I got on the phone with Logitech's customer service (Terrible experience, was extremely disappointed with Logitech) and they (poorly) guided me through what to do to receive a new mouse. As the package says to return to Logitech and not the store upon which you bought the product, this was the only way to do things. I go through the process which involves faxing them a copy of the receipt (Faxing?? really??) To my dismay, 6 MONTHS LATER there is still NOTHING. Complete waste of 100 dollars. Way to go, Logitech."
2,Looks great but NOT so functional,"The mouse looks amazing however there are a lot of problems with it. For one, the battery doesn't last very long so you need to recharge it constantly. Also, the mouse needs to be within 2 feet of the receiver for it to operate so you may need a usb cord extender. Then all the extra buttons are pretty much useless. Document Flip and the Search buttons are completely worthless. And the whole advanced scroll wheel thing is really stupid unless you are scrolling a huge document. The mouse still works great if you just use it like a normal mouse; HOWEVER, if you use the middle button (pressing down on the scroll wheel) a lot for games/opening in tabs, DO NOT get this mouse because you really have to push on the scroll wheel for it to click."
5,Refurb note,"I've got a refurbished one (not from Amazon), and had trouble getting it working. There is no reset button on it, just a connect utility with the software that wasn't working either. I was about to toss it until I finally found that I needed to download & install the latest software, use its connect utility, then turn it off and back on. Now it works great and I'm loving it!"
4,"""World's most advanced"" but not World's most comfort","This is supposed to be the top of line mouse from logitech as it is advertised as ""World's most advanced mouse"". It does have the features to be the most advanced. The rocking feature, MicroGear Scroll Wheel, is out of my expectation as it is the mouse driver which decide whether the wheel to go smoothly or click-to-click instead of you. Also, this mouse is not clumsy despite its mordern functions.However, it is not the world's most comfortable mouse. Again the MicroGear Scroll Wheel will make you feel that you are not in control with this mouse. The second wheel which is besides your thumb in fact take up the space of your thumb. The forward and backward buttons are too slim that you have to click them carefully being afraid of breaking them.Maybe this feeling will go away after some more time, if the durability of this mouse is indeed good."
2,Very nice mouse but........,"This is a great mouse but.....The right side of the mouse is coated with some kind of rubbery substance. Not sure why - traction????Anyway this side of the otherwise elegant product gets very ""gummy"" as it begins to wear.Trying to peal the substance off is a real night mare. The mostly cool looking mouse now looks (and feels) pretty junky on that side. Doesn't look at all like you'd expect from a $100+ device."
2,Avoid this mouse if you use Vista,"I've owned this mouse for about a year now, and for the majority of that time I loved it. Unfortunately I recently put together a new system, and decided to upgrade to Vista x64, in order to take advantage of 4GBs or more of RAM. While this mouse worked perfectly in XP, it freezes up quite often in Vista, becoming totally unresponsive for several seconds before beginning to work again. This can happen once in two hours, or five times inside of ten minutes, it doesn't really seem to have any predictability.After dealing with it for a few days I began to research the problem and discovered that others were having similar issues in Vista. I also discovered that Logitech doesn't seem to be acknowledging the problem, so whether or not there will be a fix, and if so, when, is anybody's guess. I find it inconveniencing enough that I will be replacing the mouse with one that doesn't randomly glitch out on me."
5,Great product. Worth every penny.,Great product. Worth every penny. I only use logitech and the MX Rev is the best one yet. This is actually my second one.
2,Jumpy,"I find the cursor extremely jumpy. I'm on a MacBook Pro, and compared to the built in trackpad and the magic mouse the mx revolution is just not smooth. I've cleaned the lens with q-tips and compressed air hoping it was just dirty, but the problem persists.The scroll wheel also seems a little finicky. Whenever you finish scrolling in one direction, it often ""bounces"" back a few lines in the other direction. Not so annoying when browsing the web; EXTREMELY annoying when trying to cycle through weapons in Borderlands 2 though!It fits the hand nicely, but overall it's definitely not a product I would recommend."
2,"Stutters, hangs, and clicks don't work","Ownership: 1.5 yearsWhile moving the mouse around, the pointer on the screen occasionally doesn't move at all. Sometimes button clicks don't work either.I read that this might be a problem with the distance between the mouse and receiver, so I moved my receiver to ~1' from the mouse. Still a problem.The issue is so bad I keep another mouse on my desk and use it when this mouse is acting up.Also bad: the battery is non-removable. If the battery dies, you need to find another mouse while this one charges."
3,It's a decent mouse,"Battery life leaves much to be desired. I'm also used to a MX3100 mouse, because of the placement of the laser, I reduce hand/wrist movement a lot when I use the MX3100. The revolution is comfortable, sensitive and feature-rich, but the laser placement and battery life leave much to be desired."
4,"Superb mouse, minor defects, where's the carrying case?","Superb mouse all around.Sometimes the scroll wheel slips out of its gear system, and that can be annoying. But otherwise it's excellent.Too bad Logitech doesn't include a carrying case for it like they do their PC-cameras!!"
1,carpal tunnel revisited,I bought this because of the improved features over the 'old' MX mouse. The unit is taller and the scroll wheel is further from the back of the mouse than the old MX. My hand began to hurt almost instantly. I'm going back to the 'old' MX...
1,This is an expensive lemon,"I have tried for 3 months to love my new mouse. It has always been erratic, and at first, I thought it was me. I thought, I just don't know enough about technology, and that's why it misbehaves. Now, after reading all the poor reviews, I see it is not me. It is a lemon. I have all the same problems as the other reviewers. I have tried to change the settings, I've unistalled the software, alas...it's the pits. Now, I don't have the heart to tell my boss the bad news. They shelled out big bucks for this, and I'm switching back to my old Dell mouse that came with my computer. DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU RELY ON YOUR MOUSE!!!!! DON'T DO IT!!!"
3,A little too fancy,"I've had this mouse for about an hour now and I've come to these conclusions:- The scroll wheel is nice and smooth but will take some getting used to- Movement is generally precise but has been occasionally jerky and unresponsive- Mouse feels good in the hand though is a bit heavy (I realized I pick up the mouse to go across two monitors sometimes)- The buttons near the thumb (left and right arrows) seem pretty useless and really, really irritating to my thumb, if they weren't there this mouse would feel 100% betterMaybe I still have to get used to it but I just might be shipping this thing back... If it was 1/3 the price I would just cope but at this price point I want utter perfection."
1,Stopped working after 3 years,"Worked great for awhile, then slowly became less and less responsive when I'd put it in its charger. I've tried the old-school eraser method on the contacts, no dice. I've googled the issue and tried the simple fixes, nothing works. Someone suggested soldering resistors to . . . yeah right, not gonna happen. I expect a LOT better from Logitech."
2,Wireless function suck big time.,"I used this mouse for about 4 years and had to deal on a regular basis with the mouse becoming choppy and not responding. I just got so frustrated that I ended up smashing the mouse. (after 4 years) It look like it might have to do with wireless network. Also, I tried to install the latest Logitech software on many occasions. Each time I had to uninstall it b/c the mouse stopped working. In short, great hardware. Software and wireless are horrible."
2,Be warned - no middle mouse button,"I like Logitech mice in general and as this one is the new ""top of the line"" I gave it a go. It's well built & designed, and feels pretty comfortable, but there is one major drawback which caused me to return it. The new fancy scrollwheel cannot be used as a regular button - wheel click is hardwired to change the scroll mode. If, like many people, you're a user of software which makes use of the middle button (like Firefox) then forget it. I can't believe Logitech made such a nice mouse and messed up on such a basic feature."
5,As good as a mouse gets,"Exceptional, as computer mice go. MUCH better feel than the Microsoft models. Driver works almost flawlessly with XP. It occassionally doesn't load immediately, so I just wait a few seconds for my custom settings to work. That's only when switching between profiles though. Battery life is fantastic and recharging is reasonably fast. Comfort is top notch. Quite perfect really. I don't use the extras much, but I reassigned the ZOOM button to close apps fast. I only wish I could reassign the side wheel to operate audio volume instead."
2,Great for 3 month,"The mouse worked great for 3 month (5 Stars for those 3 month), then the left click stopped working properly, it would register 1 out of 10 clicks which makes it extremely frustrating to use. I've tried to use a different USB port for the receiver, reinstall driver, move all wireless devices away from the mouse, tried it on a different PC, but still no worky. For a premium mouse this is unacceptable and not being able to left click renders the mouse useless (1 Star). The Mouse is cover by warranty, and Logitech is suppose to send me a new one (+1 star) but if that one breaks in 3 month then this will be the last time I buy a Logitech mouse."
3,Great mouse with design flaw,"I have this mouse for more than a year now.Pro:Excellent response and rangeErgonomic design (Atleast fits very well for my hands)With the charging station, no more battery issues.Now the problem seems to be that this model develops a problem after some use where it startsto send double click signal when you click it once! Researching more in logitech forum shows thatothers are experiencing the same and has to do with microswitch wearing out.If this problem was fixed, I will buy this mouse again as I really have no other complaints.. butfor now, time to hunt for another mouse."
3,"Good, not perfect","was looking for a better mouse for my engineering software. I have the Logitech MX-LASER mouse and got real used to it. The splined scroll wheel was starting to drive me nuts while zooming in and out on a particular drawing. The scroll rocker was very nice but not as accurate as I like and after reading the description on the Revolution it seemed to be a solid answer. After receiving it, my first complaint was the ergonomics, it just seems a bit awkward but I have gotten used to it. It is configurable so the first thing that went away was the odd ""search"" button just south of the scroll wheel. I can use it as a menu key to bring up functions in my software and scroll through them pretty quick. I find myself not using the side rocker all that much as it's a bit far forward on the mouse for my thumb but in some situations it works well.All said, the only really nice feature is the scroll wheel. If I could yank it out and stick it in my MX-Laser, then I would truly be happy."
3,a bit laggy and too big for my hands to feel comfortable.,"i used it with macbook pro... it felt a bit laggy... but it's a sexy mouse none the less.i would give it more stars if it was smaller... it was just a little too big for my hands.the quality of the mouse is amazing i must say. i used logitech software with mac os x 10.5.6.... no crashes or freezes.in the end i returned it because i felt it was a little bit laggy for my (sometimes) gaming needs... and it was a bit too big for my hands.try this out @ staples or best buy before buying it.edit:i bought the VX NANO instead... the best decision ever. it's smaller than the MX and it feels great in my hands. also feels like there's less lag compared to the MX. the only thing i miss is the thumb wheel that came with the MX, but no big deal."
1,How about a lefty version?,"Great ergonomics... my foot. I guess I'll keep using my mx-610.I understand that almost all mice are going to favor the right hand to some degree, but this getting ridiculous. Can logitech at least let me pay extra for a special order?"
1,Stuttering issues make mouse unusable.,"This is my favorite mouse by design/weight/ergonomics standards. Unfortunately the mouse stutters HEAVILY when used anywhere near a wireless router. This makes the mouse unusable for most people. If you plan to do any kind of gaming (I'm not talking about hardcore here... any games involving a mouse), DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT."
3,Would be a great mouse if the battery would hold charges for more than 5 months,"I bought this mouse in Feb of '09 and was more pleased with it but in July I started getting a red blinking light when recharging. I contacted logitech support and they were more tahn happy to send out a replacement (fast shipping too). I was once again thrilled with this mouse.Unfortunately, yesterday (6 months after the replacement arrived) the dreaded red light returned. I've contacted Logitech for another replacement but I'm not thrilled with the fact that 2 separate units have serious battery issues."
5,Great Mouse!,"This is my first specialty mouse and, to be honest, I never really thought it would make a difference. A mouse is just a mouse after all. But - WOW!!! I never realized how much easier work is with a good moue. So many more tasks can be done with one click - moving fwd and back on web pages, zooming in and out, etc. It really makes things go faster. And the shape is much more comfortable to work with.If you're not sure about spending the money - it's definitely worth it!"
2,Sticking/Lag/Stuttering Problem!,"All I know is that I wish I had seen this message board:[...]BEFORE I purchased this mouse! Yes, it is very comfortable and yes it is a relatively good mouse if you can stand the pointer stuttering and lagging for a brief second everytime anything loads. I took it for a while but finally got fed up! I am returning this tomorrow for another type since I read that this same problem is apparently happening to many people. I'm confused at why the reviews on amazon where all pretty good and not many people talked about this terrible problem since there are so many people talking about it on the logitech forum! arrgggh is all I have to say!"
2,"not durable, battery life sucks.","Loved the heavy scroll wheel while it lasted. The battery life started out good, but as of this week, a short 6 months after I bought it, the battery life is a joke. After being on the charger all night it was telling me that ""battery life is critical"" by early afternoon. My scroll wheel is jammed. I always knew that I would hate having a cordless mouse because I cannot tolerate the idea that I can't use my computer because I forgot to charge the mouse. They should make a non-cordless version of this mouse. Even then I would hesitate to buy it because the thing that sets it apart is the scroll wheel, and it is too delicate. I also never got used to the slight lag that occurs when you first move the mouse after it has gone to sleep."
1,Lag/Freeze problems are endemic to this mouse,"You can google ""MX revolution problems"" and find out, ad nauseum, about the endemic lag/freeze problems with this mouse. I'm sorry I didn't do my homework and burnt $100."
2,Unacceptable,"This mouse is very comfortable, it glides smoothly and the flywheel mousewheel is amazing. It has, however, one insurmountable flaw:It has freezes or stutters frequently, to the point of being completely unusable. If you browse the Logitech forums you'll find thread after thread full of complaints about this problem for the MX Revolution, and no solutions. I'm disappointed in this mouse, and in Logitech for making such an inferior product and not trying to rectify their error."
3,Logitech MX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse,I got this to replace a MX Laser 1000. I returned it because I could not get used to the thumb wheel. My thumb kept rubbing it. Otherwise it seemed a small step up from the MX Laser 1000.Amazon gets a big thumbs up for their first class return policy. I got a full refund and didn't even have to pay return shipping. Amazon provided a prepaid label.
5,The Best Mouse Ever.,"The best mouse I have ever owned. Comfortable, easy to use and charge. Has off button, amount of charge left indicator, built in search button and built in open documents navigation button."
1,wasted my money,"I got this thing used and now I regret it. It worked for a few weeks and then it started pausing and laging. When I checked on the Logitech web sight I found an army of people having the same problems. Now I'm trying to figure out what mouse I'm going to replace thing thing with. Oh, and ""shame on you"" to the seller for sending me this crap. Now i know why you sold it..."
3,Disappointed,"I was very pleased to begin with. After using it for a while, I'm finding that the wheel turns freely, on it's own. This disrupt my game and gets me killed all too often. The left button has also stopped working consistently. This mouse was very expensive and I expected it to hold up to playing games, since that it what it was advertised for. I have used Logitech for for close to 20 years and I'm very disappointed that the quality seems to be a thing of the past."
2,Nice Mouse but Bad w/OS X 10.4.10 and Laptops,"I just got off the phone with Logitech support about this. I tried using the MX Revolution with my MacBook Pro. Every time I tried to sleep the MBP with the Logitech Control Center 2.2.2 software, the machine would lock up, forcing a hard power cycle. It would also randomly crash. Logitech said this is a known issue with their 2.2.2 software and OS X 10.4.10 and that a new driver _should_ be out in a month or so. (That's also Leopard compatible.)The mouse itself felt nice in the hand and with a little more tweaking, I think it could have been my favorite, but for now, I'll go back to my only slightly buggy LCC 2.0 software and the MX600 mouse."
4,My wireless mouse,"This is an excellent product, I love how it feels,the response time is amazing, you can't tell your working with a wireless mouse. It looks good and has great features."
2,Over-priced & hard to use,"I purchased this mouse because I previously owned an MX 1000 and I liked it. However, it failed to recharge just past the warranty expired. The MX Revolution was the closest in terms of featurs to my old mouse. There are three things I don't like about it. (1) The scroll wheel they hype so much is very hard to get used to, and it does respond to changes in the preferences. (2) The side wheel, which allows you to quickly change applications, is physically hard to use because the mouse want to slip when you use it. It is really much easier to use the keyboard. (3) It loses is charge too quickly. I tried to contact Logitech about the problems I was having, especially with the scroll wheel and the preferences, but they did not respond. I am currently looking for another mouse."
2,Mickey Mouse,"I have had Logitech Mice for years. I've always been pleased with them until now. As I type this I've gone back to using my old Mouseman Optical mouse. It's so old that the sliders are mostly worn away. I purchased the Logitech MX Revolution Cordless Laser Mouse, installed it and started having problems. My best guess is that the range is very limited. The USB port is only on the left and I'm right handed. It doesn't have a smooth horizontal movement(jerky) and the vertical seemssimilar. The software installs multiple programs, services, whatever and my poor old computer (AMD Athlon 64 3400+ 2Gig memory) has slowed down noticeably. The last thing I try before I give up on the new mouse is to buy a USB port extender. I'm not hopeful. Not Again"
4,New Experience,"Cons, first. At first I was really excited to get this in the mail then a few things really started to bug me. YOU CANT MIDDLE MOUSE CLICK which I had set for multiple programs which I had to reconfigure. Affected my games and Firefox. Another thing the battery life seems to quickly be getting shorter but I still only have to charge it shortly every other day so no issue. Idles by itself so I don't find myself really using the off button.Pros are it's comfortable and easy to use I guess. It's black, cool with my other stuff, wireless is reliable.I guess that the fact that your hand rests in the natural groping position might make up for the NO MIDDLE CLICK."
4,about this mice,"this is a great mice, easy to use, and the laser pointing make it more accurate. nice design, and holding comfort. only thing I don't like this mice, is it's price is too high."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!,This mouse doesn't work when the receiver is located under the mouse itself (like from a PC under your desk). The battery that recharges inside the mouse didn't even last 6 months before it stopped working completely. The mouse stutters constantly if it's not in DIRECT LINE OF SIGHT with the receiver. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!!!
2,Makes for a nice paperweight....,If you have Vista - forget this mouse. I couldn't even install it. Logitech will tell you to revert to an older Windows XP installer but why bother? That would just cause problem installations with new Vista programs going forward.I'm not sure why they advertise on the box that it is optimized for Vista if Vista can not even recognize the driver.I gave it 2 stars because it does make an attractive paperweight albeit an expensive one.Thank you Logitech and Microsoft for wasting hours of my day and money.
3,They do not ship me the decent product,"The product I get is not decent, it has some malfunctionalities right after several days usage. The battery is great, lasting a real long time. But I won't choose logitech revolution any more."
2,nice mouse BUT....,"It's a nice mouse that's very ergonomic and feels good in the hand. Unfortunately the drivers for Mac suck. I've adjusted my settings numerous times but the mouse controls are either too sensitive or not sensitive enough. Using the scroll wheel pages scroll by at blindingly fast speeds or painfully slow. It's very, very frustrating."
1,Arrived D.O.A. ! ! !,I purchased this mouse as a refurbished item; it arrived as promised but would not sync up with the receiver. I wanted to return it for replacement but the vendor did not have any more in stock. I contacted logitech by e-mail and they were helpful and said that i could return the mouse of course the shipping charges would be my responsibilty. I decided to go with a different mfg. All in all not a satisifying experience. Would not recommend a refurbished MX Revolution Mouse.
5,I Love this Mouse!,"This is my 2nd MX Revolution and I was very happy that I was still able to buy a new one, as this model has been discontinued, and the latest replacement model has not had very good reviews. My hand never cramps due to it's comfortable ergonomic design and all the features perform well and are user friendly. I, and many others, wish Logitech would bring it back. I love this mouse and hope it lasts as many years as my last one did."
1,Beware of Issues,This is my first Amazon review just to warn you about this mouse. There are very large numbers of people who buy this mouse and have stuttering issues. If you don't believe me check the logitech forums. Logitech will not admit to a faulty mouse and will only replace your mouse with more faulty mice. Just a heads up.
2,"looks great, has great features, but VERY poor performance","Pros:~ this mouse looks great, which is why it caught my attention.~ the buttons and design are very helpfulCons:~ the most important part of the mouse, its performance is extremely poor. I have a new, state-of-the-art Alienware computer, and no matter what adjustments i try to make, the mouse has major lag. It makes my advanced computer seem like an old Pentium I machine.And if you are a gamer, definitely, DO NOT buy this mouse no matter what you hear. You've been warned!"
4,"Works great with Vista, minor issues","The mouse works great with even greater features. Side scroll works beautifully with Vista's Areo feature. Quick response time works great with gaming. The pros go on and on. One big issue is that my scroll wheel often gets stuck in the free spinning mode and then will randomly switch back into normal scrolling after a few minutes. Also its right handed only, and I live in a house full of lefties. Oh and the SENSOR SUCKS. I had to move it to the front USB jack so it is facing almost right at the mouse and right near it. Battery life is great."
4,Logitech MX Revolution,"This mouse is a step up from an MX1000 IMHO. The side flip and free rotate center wheels are major improvements. I would have given the MXR 5 stars, however the rechargable battery lasts 3 days at 18 hours a day use."
2,Poor quality,"Good features including scroll wheel, charging, and support of Mac OS X. However, poor quality given the price of this product. The scroll wheel broke about 8 months after purchase. See review by Thistle below. I subsequently purchased a Kensington Expert Mouse (trackball) which has held up quite well."
4,"Great Mouse, but.... :-\",Great Mouse - and on Nov 23rd '07 it was a price that can't be beat!I especially like the thumb-rest.Only 1 thing I wish Logitech would figure out: I have BIG hands and I travel for my job. Even the portable revolution mouse is too small for my hands. Why can't they make a Normal-sized mouse that can still store it's transmitter? Because of this the Revolution will probably not be my primary mouse.
1,Not for Win2k,"Amazon indicates this product is backward compatible but Logitech has drivers only for XP, Vista and Mac via download. Wish I had known that before I spent a hundred bucks for it."
3,I didn't realize it was a rechargable mouse,It is probably my fault but I did not realize it was a rechargeable mounse... I have had one of these several years ago and because I frequently forget to put it on the charger at the end of the day - it loses its power and ...........other wise it works ok
1,Logitech will not repair their equipment-throw it away,"Logitech will not repair their equipment. I told him I had a minor damage. Their phone tech said they sell throw-away products, buy a new one.UNACCEPTABLE. I will never buy another Logitech product as long as they maintain such an anti-customer strategy."
1,ComputerGeeks mislead,"Logitech MX Revolution Cordless Laser MouseComputerGeeks sent me only the refurbished (and quite dusty and dirty) mouse and USB receiver. Great. But, how am I supposed to use it without the charging dock? It is a completely useless piece of plastic. No where did it say that it would not be included. And on top of that the package did not include a Logitech CD or owners manual (which isn't that bad but they are still listed in the product description). I am extremely irritated and now I will have to spend the next two weeks I have before I go off to college messing around with extra shipping costs, returns/exchanges, my own personal time and customer service. At this point I do not plan on returning to ComputerGeeks as a customer."
1,What a piece of crap,"Man I have seen crap before but this was the worst mouse I ever bought. No use, nada, zip. Oh thats right I bought this for my friend's birthday, so I didnt get to even use it. So I would have to say its ok. But its no gaming mouse."
3,Good mouse with penis,"This is the best mouse, but it has to be updated with new technologies such as Darkfield Laser and small wireless adapter. Unfortunately, Logitech team are engineering, not the customer oriented company. it is why you still have to plug the looks like penis adapter and always care the mouse pad with you. Hopefully, their CEO finally resign and they will make some updates."
2,A nightmare - go online and read up on the charging problem,"I actually like the mouse. But the charger is so poorly constructed that there is a whole Knowledge Base article about it.[...]It is a total nightmare and when the thing goes dead, well you have to slam it into the cradle, or maybe clean the heads, or maybe do a pink fairy dust thing, who knows. I only know that Logitech is fully aware of the problem, but suggested to me it could be one of three things which I translated as, 'they don't want to send me a new charger'. Oh well, there are other really good mice out there. Just look around."
2,Too erratic,Its ok for surfing the net. Has a lot of programmable buttons.But i went back to my logitech M310 which has a cord and only three programmable buttons but works great. When working with photoshop or audio and video programs you can't have a squirrely mouse.
3,It's nothing to write home about,"Mouse has a funny feel to the surface, other wise it is ok. It gets the job done, i have seen better from this company."
5,Buy this Book,"Stop reading reviews--just buy this book and read it. It's a small price to pay for freedom. No other book identifies the enemy like Holy War. It summarizes a mass of information, often impossible to understand,in way that anyone can understand--no academic BS or PC. If you like Kushner's work on FOX then you will love this read."
1,Freak Out Over Old News,"This book was a great disappointment. Maybe if it had been printed BEFORE 9/11 it might have been worth talking about, but it is all old news. Not only that, but Kushner writes like a raving, paranoid lunatic on a caffeine binge. Obviously he loves to freak out and thinks you should be hysterical, too.For instance, he believes that every neighborhood mosque is preaching bloody jihad against America, and every Muslim is a wannabe suicide bomber. Not.If you haven't already picked up 99% of this material from listening to Fox News you have must have willfully turned down your hearing aid."
3,Required some effort to get up-and-running,"After some trial-and-error attempts to get this item working on an old Mitsubishi Amity CN 1 with a 16bit PC Card slot, my final solution required the use of a Dazzle Compact Flash PC Card adapter rather than the one included with this product. Additionally, I downloaded newer CF-300 drivers from Anycom. Using the Dazzle CF adapter, the Anycom CF-300 works fine. Interestingly, the CF-300 product and its accompanying CF adapter worked fine in a Dell laptop with a 32bit Cardbus slot, but not it the Amity CN 1."
2,Slighty disappointing,I had hoped this would be a great one as we are big fans of the rat pack and Bing Crosby....but the quality was sub-par. I know the label says it is done that way on purpose...but I cannot even imagine it looking that bad on tv back when it was originally aired...it looks more like someone backed a tank over it again and again. Really too bad considering the show was a good one. The sound quality is much better than the picture and the 3 stars are quite humorous and entertaining. Hopefully any future episodes would be remastered in much better fashion!!
3,The Chairman speaks,"(channels Franks:) What? T'irteen and a half clams for ONE Sinatra show? Gedouddahere! For dat price youse should get at least a coupla hours, not 30 stinkin' minutes!Here's t'ree dollahs baybee, cuz dat's all your wort'!"
4,High Hopes is appropriate,"Before I purchased this DVD, I read reviews from others who noted the poor recording quality. I do agree. If you must have top quality tech to enjoy a show, be warned about this disk.However, if you are the type who loves old family movies made before the advent of camcorders, etc., and Sinatra, Martin and Crosby are among your favorites, this DVD is a lot of fun. It is much like watching an old 8mm home movie but what's being shown more than makes up for the way it looks. I enjoyed every minute of it, though I'll probably play it for audio more than vidoe in my repeat viewings. The film quality is the only thing that keeps this product from a five-PLUS star rating."
4,Made Mom Happy,"I love these old singers and that's all that mattered to me and to my mom. Mom is 91 and has middle stage Alzheimer's. My only desire is to see her happy. Watching this DVD (and 3 others I purchased similar to it) made her happy. No, the quality is not perfect--it's captured from old time TV when the quality of the shows was NOT as crisp and clear as we get today. WHO CARES? Not me...or mom. The ""feeling"" is there; the old time songs are there; it makes us happy!!"
1,frank sinatra show (high hopes),VERY POOR QUALITY DVD VERY GRAINY AND AFTER I RETURN MY POOR QUALITY TO SELLEER. I CAN'T GET MY SELLER TO RETURN MY E=MAIL OR GET CREDIT BACK TO MY ACCOUNT. (BEEN TWO WEEKS)
5,Great book.,"I already have these as individual books in the English version, but bought this because it has US measurements as well as metric, which saves me time and effort, as a Senior Citizen. Delia Smith is my favorite cook book author and I have never been disappointed with any of her recipes that I have tried. Her Christmas cake recipe is excellent. This was a used book in excellent condition."
3,Only if you like this kind of music is it good,I made the mistake of buying this cd just because I like the Real World. The music on the cd isnt really very diverse in the sense of the different types of music it could have on it. You really have to be sure you want it for the music and not the novelty of it having to do with the Real World. I think I'd like it alot more if I was more into the type of music they have on the cd.
3,where are the real artists from the show??,"not really knowing much of the music on here (i do like collective soul and toad the wet sproket though), i'm gonna give it a neutral rating. i have to say they could have done a much better job at going about this. instead of just letting the cast members mix and match music that does NOT go together, they should have maybe included some songs by Galactic, a new orleans based jazz-funk-acid-jam band that they kept playing throughout the entire season without much recognition. Galactic is an awesome band!!"
1,Instrumental,"This album is instumental. If you want to listen to Muzak, this is your CD. Otherwise, forget it. Classic country songs aren't the same without the sappy story or cheesy lyrics."
4,Students Love,My students love these songs. They will sing them all day long as they work. During individual seat work time I'll put this cd on and the students will sing as the work. It helps keep other talking to a minimal.
3,Sounds similar,It all sounds the same. Would be good for massages or sleep. I was more interested in finding something peaceful while driving. This would put you to sleep.
4,A really good book,"No longer in print but a definite addition to anyone who is looking to work through old family issues. The workbook definitely started me on the road to recovery 22 years ago. My own works (see my Getting Past Your Breakup book here on Amazon) are partially based on Ms. McConnell's exercises. It's a good book. If you grew up in a dysfunctional family, try to get your hands on it."
2,"Love the pendant, not happy with the clasp for it","I really like the pendant and am very happy with it. Unfortunately, the clasp for the pendant broke the very first time I wore it."
2,Does Not Fit,"This is supposed to be a custom fit for my 2007 Honda Shadow Spirit 750DC, but it did not fit at all. There was no room for my brake assembly. It pulled it tight next to my exhaust pipe and did not work anymore. I don't see how there was any other way to install it. I followed the directions and it just did not fit. I read how other people with the same bike did manage to get it installed without any problems, so I'm just not sure what happened. Now I have to pay for the return shipping and will probably be charged an expensive restocking fee."
3,A Student's perspective,"I took a math class using this book and it was frustrating. The problems were challenging which was good, but the support offered by the book was poor. If you needed to understand something you couldn't use the book to help you out. All it did was spit out a few equations and inconsistent derivations of them. I found the book very frustrating and if you're looking to learn math skills I'd recommend something else."
2,Not good,"It is a safe to assume that a book isn't good if the author's(') name(s) is/are larger than the title. Many textbooks suffer from this egomania which can be easily cured with an exacto knife: Just cut around the name(s) and peel.The book suffers from a poor use of the english language with ideas being presented with too many unnecessary words. Images are labelled with three numbers making the layout confusing i.e. ""Fig. 14.9.5"" This book has a sloppy finish to it and will only waste your time. Integrated Physics and Calculus is a much better buy."
3,It's nice to have a designated doggy towel...,"...but it doesn't have to be this one. My Golden Retriever goes through four or five towels a week when it's muddy and it's nice to be able to tell his from mine. That said, this one works just as well as any other towel, though not necessarily better. There's nothing wrong with the item, but nothing spectacular about it either."
4,Good Product,These step bars were a good replacement for the old rusty ones that were on my Jeep. Only thing I have to complain about is that the directions sent with this product were for a Toyota Pickup. I had to go to the manufacturer's website to get the proper set of instructions.
2,Interesting subject. Poor writing,"While the subject matter itself is fascinating, the author somehow manages to stifle the enthusiasm, perhaps due to his inadequate writing skills. The book lacks an overall coherence and the author's gluey expressions and cumbersome syntax make it a slog to read. Where was the copy-editor?"
3,Different Yoga,This DVD is very different from the usual yoga video. The two 30 minute segments offer some traditional poses along with some unusual moves that are very flowing. I didn't really feel the relaxed bliss that I do after a power yoga workout but this is great for a change of pace.
1,Unfunny...,"The strips are just not funny. Not only that, but all these glowing reviews here? The reviewers have only ever reviewed *this* book. I think these are fake reviews submitted by the authors or their friends under other names. If it's so bad you have to shill your own work, it's really bad."
2,Good while it works,"The case started off well enough - installing the system parts was neither easier nor more difficult than average. At first, despite having more fans than my previous system it genuinely was more silent. But things went downhill fast - the construction of the case is flimsy at best, meaning that it starts to come apart as the screws loosen and everything shakes and rattles - it is like having a jet engine next to my head. It is now far louder than my older system! I tighten the screws regularly, but this only provides temporary relief as they unloosen quickly. Poorly made.In the end a very disappointing purchase - a waste of money, since the only thing to justify the extra expense was its alleged 'silent' operation. I would have been better served by any bargain basement case at a fraction of the price."
5,Antec Sonata,"The Antec Sonata is an extreamly well builted case. Even without a removeable mobo tray this was by far the easiest case I have ever used to assemble a computer. I was very pleased to see that the power supply was sata ready, a feature I didnot see on any of the on-line reviews. I read.As of now I only have two complaints about the case. First I was disappointed about the paint job. I read about this supposed automotive finish but noticed the excessive amount of orange peel. Not quite automotive quality. Maby I will hit it with some 2,000 grit to finish it off. Second was the holes in the side of the case (which will be easilly fixed with some 1/16 aluminum, black paint and silicon). These holes allowed me to hear the cpu fan clear as day from two feet away.In conclusion, great case easy to assemble and wow look at those two blue spotlights in the front."
4,Excellent case - everything 5 stars except the manual,"This is an excellent case which is super quiet as promised. But the instruction manual is pathetic with no readability or pictures. You need to play around the case to figure out how to assemble things. There are no numberings or naming conventions for the screws, insertion mechanisms etc...But once you get to assemble the case, you would love it. The front flip-cover for the USB ports appears cheap, but works.If the manual was good, I would have given 5stars for this product."
2,Noisy fans. Terrible customer support.,"The big selling point for the Sonata is that it is quiet. Unfortunately, the quality of the fans is such that the bearings start making noise after a few weeks. I had the case fan replaced a month ago. Soon after that, the power supply fan started making noise. I can not get Antec to return my calls to cross-ship a replacement power supply. I could get an RMA number online and send in the power supply for a replacement, but I use the computer for work and can't take a two week vacation."
1,Power supply caught on fire.,"I want to alert potential buyers to a serious problem I had with this case's power supply. It caught on fire 2 days after I completed building my system. Luckily I was present at the time and put the fire out and rescued my system. Another problem has been the front USB ports. One will accept a USB connector but it does not work. The other is damaged and will not even accept the connector. I have emailed Antec twice so far about this and no action yet. Otherwise, the color is nice. The case is quiet but not substantially different from similar cases by different manufactures."
5,See Volume 1,"This sequal is just as good as the first , same visual homur and style . Most recommended especialy if you enjoyed the previous book ."
3,Printing is only okay.,"If you compare this book (both Dark House editions) to the printed books of 1972, 1968, and 1964...you notice clearly HOW dark and dingy the reproduction is in these volumes. Are they worth $18.00? Of course! But compared to the old school print process (of 30 to 45 years ago) the reproduction sucks.I guess these are scans of prints and NOT photos or plates made from the original art. I would bet $1000 on it.These looks like scanned art to a degree.It's a shame they did not go all out and reprint these wonderful strips as they were presented.Only old school book collectors like me, will ever see the TRUE beauty of these strips.Only 3 stars."
4,Have a Laugh,"It's a Series of none PC (Un Politicaly Correct) Cartoon strips from Playboy etc, good laugh from 70's to 90's, nice change from today's be correct, fall into line. It's a laugh not a statment, and in that it's GREAT LAUGHT Out Load, Buy it now??."
1,"Little Annie Fanny, Volume 2: 1970-1988","This was very, very disappointing for me. The political satires do not stand up in time, antiquated. There is zil sexual intimation. But the worse part is that about HALF of the contents are REPEATS from Volume 1, which you should buy instead---better quality, too. DO NOT BUY VOL 2! Rated less than one star."
3,It takes long to get into the story.,"The book was fine, i guess. Not as scary as Baby Sitter, for exemple. It takes long to get into the story. Half the book, (the first half) was B O R I N G. Then there's a bit more exitement, and you star to turn pages a little faster. conclusion: read it, id you don't have anything better to do."
4,Must read for concerned men and women,"I throughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. Boteach's critique of the media/Hollywood portrayal of women is a vital read. He shows how our society has devalued and degraded women. Anyone with daughters should especially read this, as Boteach shows how even fourteen year olds are being pressured to conform to a perverse cultural view of women as sex objects. In a time of cultural sleaze, Boteach's moralistic concerns are right on the mark.The only thing that annoyed me was his constant reference to the Book of Genesis, which is a bogus account of our creation. I recommend just skipping those parts and getting to the heart of Boteach's argument, which is very persuasive."
1,Personal Opinions Masqueerading as Cultural Criticism,"Mr. Boteach continually presents himself as a spokesman for Judaism. He is not. His knowledge is sorely lacking. His books are superficial and his impact is a joke. He presents himself as a cultural critic. He is not. He confuses entertainment with culture. Every teenager knows that MTV is not real life. Overstatement and straw men serve Mr. Boteach's purpose. He gives himself a soapbox, jumps up on it and preaches. Boteach runs after celebrities in order to promote his agenda, namely himself. He glorified Michael Jackson and escorted him like a pal all around town until Jackson tired of him. Well finally, no culture has treated women better than America in our times. Any suggestion to the contrary is just plain false. Boteach's opinions are just wrong, wrong, wrong."
5,Very Insightful,"I've been coaching girls soccer for 7 years now, and I was lookng for something to help me better work with my team as they became teenagers. This book really helped me understand how the girl athlete thinks and what motivates her. Great soccer drills and the team building exercises by Colleen Hacker were even better."
1,"cheap mail boxes, not well built","These are cheap mailboxes and I dont recomment them. Maybe for short-term use, but not for long term. The back is hard to mount to any wall, and break easily. Buy a more sturdy mail box holder."
2,Construction off,Organizer was poorly constructed with holes to build set in the wrong place. Had to re-drill some holes to make it all fit together and it is still cock-eyed.
1,Please don't waste your time with this.,"Item was received damaged and defective. I called the company, guy on phone was nice; however, the person he talked to about my problem said that I was not assembling correctly. They wanted to ship another one, but I was able to assemble where we could use anyway. We needed shelving immediately. The item is shoddy and I do not understand why any company would want to send this product out with their name on it. It says it holds up to 200 pounds and it is already buckling under the little weight we have on it. Little value for money spent. It is cardboard for the shelves."
1,Buy Something Else,Big waste of money. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Particle board sides/top/bottom...supposed to be held together with a little tube of glue and small wooden pegs...yeah right! Trays are cardboard. Do yourself a favor and stay away from it.
3,"Quality going down, but not the price","I've bought several of these over the years from the same manufacturer. They get flimsier all the time, but the price keeps going up.It will do the job, though I'm not sure for how long."
4,"It's a little work, but worth it in the end!","This is a great organizer bin! It is a hassle to put together but worth the work! I love how it has made our life at work easier. It probably isn't made for a ton of paper in each slot, as the shelves are made of cardboard stuff. It works for us, and I'd recommend."
3,ORDER THE NEXT SIZE UP!,"Outstanding quality and well worth the price, but the sizing is about one size too small. I normally wear a solid 8 in ladies suits (I'm 5 feet 10 inches tall and 140 pounds). I have owned other Harve Bernard clothing and this is definitely one size too small. My recommendation is to order up a size, ladies!"
5,Super recommendation!,"This jacket was an Amazon recommendation that really was perfect for me. It fits with plenty of room to button, the shade is the purple that goes with everything, and the style is up-to-the minute fashion-wise. Can you tell? - I love it! Amazon also recommended a similar orange jacket which is equally as wonderful in every way. Great shopping, Amazon. Thanks!"
4,Autumn in Minnesota Lake Country,Very good relaxation video. Beautiful mixture of Autumn scenery and calming music. Good buy!
2,General Overveiw,"The book is a general overveiw that caught my eye to purchase because the author works and designs for Disney. I was expecting to see some great example on the CD;However, I was extremely dismayed. The examples on the CD shows how to make a basic portfolio. The book covers too much planning on a grand scale and doesn't show you quickly the steps to do something. read 5 pages and receive one answer. I wouldn't recommend the book"
4,Pleased with my purchase,"This was a great book for me, I am just getting started with Director and found the author easy to follow with just the right amount of detail. The information on using Director, coupled with a tutorial that you can follow throughout the book are great. I realize that Director can do much more than is laid out in this book, however, it is a great starting place."
1,don't let the price fool you....,"If you are looking for a book to tell you about what director is capable of, then I guess this your book. This was one of the worst technical books I have ever read. The examples really don't teach you much of anything and the book doesn't show you how to do what it is talking about."
4,"No Escape: Just Accept It, They're A Great Band","So how does No Escape's album ""Just Accept It"" stack up? Let's just say, there's no escaping the fact that No Escape is a great band. The CD has track after track of drum-pounding, lyric-spewing, heart-jumping music. Each track is filled with great lyrics, great music, and great singing. No Escape mixes Metallica's musical styles and smooth lyrics, with the singing of Soulfly, to make them a grand heavy metal band. Just Accept shoudl definately be on your Wish List, if you really want some good music."
2,Did a High Schooler make this DVD??,"I love Voivod, what they did and what is here is great. But the presentation is awful. For one the main dvd menu could have been better, but what's worse is the content like the videos there is not a 'Play All' button. Instead you have to choose a video to play, then when it's over it goes back the menu to choose another video. LAME! Then the absolute most aggravating thing is the overall volume of the music is very low, I had to absolutely crank my stereo to hear anything. Sorry but I want the sound full and there is no excuse why it is not. The DVD says there are more Dvd comps from Voivod in the making. Lets hope the high school kid making it reads this and does a better job, Voivod deserves much better."
5,THIS SELLER IS AWSOME,TO MY FAVORITE SELLER BOOKMANS I AM GETTING MY DARK SHADOWS COLLECTION THANKS TO YOU. AS YOU KNOW BY NOW I AM A TRUE FAN OF THIS CLASSIC SOAP OPERA. I WAS AGE 9 WHEN THIS SHOW WAS ON TV IN BLACK AND WHITE. I WOULD RUSH HOME FROM SCHOOL TO MAKE SURE I DO NOT MISS A EPISODE. NOW THANKS TO THIS GREAT SELLER I AM RELIVING THOSE DAYS AND SHARING THIS WITH MY GROWN CHILDREN. THANKS FOR ALL YOU DO. DONNA
3,Not the best source material of Glenn Miller,"THE BEST OF GLENN MILLER contains radio transcriptions and LP tracks, both complete with a touch of surface crackle. The extraneous noise and inherent limitations in dynamics do little to detract from what is top notch material by one of the very best orchestras of the Big Band Era. Liner notes for the songs include year of release and running times. There's also a one-page synopsis of Glenn Miller's career.I have some reservations about this album's genesis--The label says FIRST CHOICE. The manufacturer (INTERSOUND) is American, yet the disc was distributed by them in Canada. That's probably how they skirted around RCA's copyright restrictions. Nowhere on this CD does it say: ""Licensed by,"" etc. Its amusing and perhaps hypocritical that this INTERSOUND Inc. knockoff comes with a warning to the user not to reproduce the CD in any form! (Their catalog, by the way, includes artists from every major label.)RUNNING TIME-- 40:50"
1,Where is the keyword of this program ?,Excuse my english language but y am french dsly have just open ce box of Flooplan and y don't find ce keyword ??Where his he ?
4,There is a trick to using this controller,"My furnace was turning the main burners of and on continuously. In my effort to debug the problem I suspected the controller. This new one is an upgrade to my old controller because it has diagnostic lights to let you know if there is a problem. Here is the trick. If I followed the wiring diagram as suggested in the manual, the controller did not work at all. I went on line and found someone who had the same problem. Instead of connecting the 24 volt line to the 24volt tab, it needed to be connected to the TH-W tab. The manual does not specify this, so only try this trick if it doesn't work for you right out of the box. It has now been operating for the last two months without issues. I expect it to work for the next several years."
5,"Perfect, but picture is wrong","The controller is great. Fortunately I knew the replacement model I was looking for because the picture is not correct for this item.Anyway, super fast shipping, easy to install, good directions, my unit is back up and running again."
3,"Beautiful, but lacking","I received this much-anticipated book today. True to description, it contains beautiful photos (one page was misprinted with a wide pink streak across the photo) and text from architects, owners, etc. What it doesn't have much of is anything more than brief or shallow explanations of HOW sustainable living takes place -- minimal floor plans (meaning only for a few of the homes reviewed.For one clear example, Lake/Flato architects built a truly innovative vacation house, with the living area surrounded - wrapped really - in the bedrooms and bathrooms of the house. Only a floor plan can reveal their creative arrangement of the rooms. The house is featured in this book, but no indication of the remarkable new layout - maximum living in minimal space. (Look for the Contemporary Architecture series for Lake/Flato architects for more information.)Broad but shallow is a good summary for this pretty, but not nearly as informative as I had hoped, book."
4,A good intro.,"This book offers a good introduction into building with earth, straw and recycled materials. There are lots of nice photos with a brief story telling how and why the builders used the chosen materials.This book does not go into depth on how to make a home out of straw bale, adobe, rammed earth or any other techniques. There are lots of other good books that do though.I am kind of disappointed in a couple of the things the author says that are a bit misleading or untrue, probably unintentionally, but non the less they are there and you will not pick them out unless you are well read on alternative building techniques."
3,A fascinating history lacking vibrancy,"Allen Bodner's sincerity and feeling for his subject is undeniable. ""When Boxing was a Jewish Sport"" contains historical information and vignettes about an era when, as the title implies, Jews were a major force in boxing. For that reason alone, the book is worth reading by any boxing history fan. The problem is with the writing. Despite ample oral histories and interviews, the book reads like a sociological text, dense and often tedious. Nonetheless, as a reference, for those who know that Benny Leonard, a Jew, was one of the five greatest pound for pound fighters ever, or for those boxing fans who don't know, the book is a wealth of boxing history not to be found elsewhere."
4,Great from Amazon,Was exactly what it said it was an a great product! I recommend to every one with a child learning.
3,A helpful children's thesaurus,"This is a good beginner's thesaurus and it works for my 8-year old daughter. She seems to know all the vocabulary words in it already, so I would say 8 is the max age for this. My issue with the thesaurus is that it doesn not list the alphabet on every page spread on the right hand side in the margin. We have the American Heritage Children's Dictionary which is very good and DOES have the alphabet on every page spread. That's why I am puzzled that the thesaurus doesn't have it. This is immeasurably helpful for early dictionary/thesaurus users. Having that visual available would reinforce in young children learning the order of the alphabet and encourage them to use a thesaurus or dictionary. Not having that makes it harder."
5,Great book!,I purchased this book for my 9 year old granddaughter. It is beautifully illustrated and she loves it. I believe it will help her with her reading. Thank you.
1,All the crap unfit to print,"This is more of a plea to delete the idiotic , poorly written piece by that Neil bozo which serves as an intro "" review "" (God help us ) . The man can't write and seems blissfully unaware of the rules of punctuation. This , no doubt , is why he's employed by the NYT . Worst of all , he ( as does the writer of this film ) ignores the first rule of studying history ; historical persons must be judged in the context of their time and place .This is trash of the lowest order . "" Dancing with the Stars "" , forsooth ! Away with you , ye daft nyaff !"
3,"Not nearly as good as ""Fourth Angel"" but worth reading","I thought ""Fourth Angel"" was terrific and started this sequel with great anticipation. I'm glad I read it, but it was not nearly as good as the first book in the series. I hate it when reviews give away too much of the plot, so I'll just say that not one but TWO people in this book turn out to be unexpected psychos. I like my mysteries more plausible than that, and the believability of the villain was a big plus in ""Fourth Angel."" I also agree with the reviewer who found much of the writing cliched. So then, why am I glad I read this book? Because the two main characters, Georgia and Mac, are interesting and believable, and I also enjoyed a number of the secondary characters. Additionally, the information about the NYFD (including its treatment of female firefighters) was both credible and interesting."
5,A First-rate Mystery,"I was looking for a good summer read when a review oh Flashover, by Suzanne Chazin, caught my eye in my local newspaper, the Philadelphia Inquirer. The book sounded so unique and interesting I went out and bought a copy. I loved it! This is a first-rate mystery with all the elements--an intriguing plot, an authentic sense of place--New York City--and most of all, realistic and sympathetic characters. Georgia Sheehan is a fantastic heroine. She's smart, tough, and yet full of human failings that make her come right off the page! I love the relationship between Georgia and Mac Marenko. The story was so exciting, I ended up reading the book in one sitting! Now, I'm going out to buy the first book in the series--The Fourth Angel."
1,Cheaply made - not a quality product at all,"Very disappointed in the quality of this product. It is very cheaply made and likely will not last even a year. The inner partitions are made of lightweight cardboard, and the outer case is an inferior form of particle board. Do not waste your money on this poorly made product."
3,Fellowes 25043 Lit. Organizer review,"The organizer is not perfect. I am annoyed with the plastic pieces thatare supposed to cover each shelf. They are hard to get on. Also, it is not all that sturdy. It was fairly easy to assemble."
1,Garbage,"This is absolute garbage. I chose this product for it's reasonable seeming price and function. The inserts are made form cardboard and the frame is made from the cheapest particle board imaginable, it's possible that it is constructed from pencil shavings and Elmer's glue. After assembly, I noticed that one of the corners was not square so I applied a bit of force to the top only to find that the dowel in the upper right hand corner had broken through the particle board; the hole had been improperly drilled, it was too short for the dowel which having no other place to go chose to liberate itself from the confines of cheep particle board and veneer. Now our letter organizer is not only ugly, cheap, poorly engineered + constructed, it's broken. I work at a start-up and didn't want to pay a lot for this type of utility but looking back I probably should have. This is a completely worthless piece of garbage."
1,poor quality,"I had one before , but this one was designed very poorly and I had to garbage it in about 2 weeks of use"
2,Piece of junk,You get what you pay for. Had to reinforce the whole thing and was able to hang it up on the wall in a medical office. Fellowes - shame on you for making and selling such a cheaply made product.
5,counting the stars and everything else through history and beyond,"This is our favorite book about numbers and counting systems. It covers counting systems from Egyptians, Babylonians, Mayans, Hindus, Greeks, computors (binary), etc. It presents a fun story for taking an historical look at counting systems and then brings us to solving a code of Beeps and Beep-Beeps that the Martains may have used - they are using base four but what is that like? What are other number sytems? We love it for numbers, counting, tallying, codes, place value and a all in story form.You may also like the Video, The Story of One, along these same lines"
5,Mathematics,This is the best book to understand math and number systems. It will help with logical thinking. Math is a universal language around the world (and maybe in the milky way too).
4,"Excellent overview, though muddled in its analysis","This book does an admirable job of documenting gay Hollywood. Not just the stars, but the directors, clothing designers, set decorators, etc. The shifting climate for gays in Hollywood is documented along with its apparent impact on gay people working in the industry. The one drawback is the muddled summation of what it all means---the author takes a romanticized, separatist view, in which the more closted eras in Hollywood are seen as building community and doing more for gay identity. I rather doubt that people who lived through that would feel the same way and his own research seems to contradict this analysis. Not a book for those looking for fresh gossip or innuendo, but entertaining, as well informative and well-documented, nonetheless."
4,Fantastic!,"This look at pre-Stonewall Hollywood was well written, and refreshing because it was not merely the ""who slept with whom"" snapshot that we have seen before. I was surprised at how many costume designers and decorators were as closeted and ashamed as they were, and the almost total absence of gay cameramen...Hmm?! I also think that Hollywood has not changed much, post-Stonewall, as we would have hoped. Easy to read, fantastic and rich with detail!"
1,Could have been better...,"Much of this book is of the ""he said/she said"" mentality. Despite what the author claims, there isn't much to back up alot of what he claims are ""facts."" I was disappointed."
2,Disappointed,"Unlike his great biography on William Haines, I did not care for this book, and did not even finish it!! It is not terribly factual and many statements and articles are taken through assumptions, theories, heresay, whatever. I like substantial biographies that can be proved. Like the biography of Peggy Hopkins Joyce, this book was a lot of ""he said"", ""they said"", and ""this book said"". I want unequivocable knowledge. This time period and the people were not from the era when much could have been compiled, but I suppose this was an admirable attempt. I was very disappointed. I thought I would have a great, fun book to read."
4,A truly amazing realization of heroin and running away,"Smack is book that many teen agers can relate to. The realization of what somebody will do to escape their problems. Wheather it be hash, heroin, running away, alochoal, or all of the above, and what people are driven to do as an addict."
4,Great book so far,"Although I haven't finished the book yet, i am definetly impressed. This book is excellent because it has so many characters with so many differnet points of veiw on whats going on in the 2 main characters Gemma and Tar's lives. This book is so good in fact that I am finding myself getting mad at certain characters like Gemma, who ditches tar (who obvioulsy needs her) to live with some random girl she met at a party and her boyfriend. I can't wait to finish ""Smack"" because I haven't even got into any part of their addiction."
3,could have been better,the book starts off slow and then gets all jumbled in the mind of this teenage girl that had NO idea of what she wants. She cares about herself and not too many others. She has a messed up home life and runs away to make everything easier for herself and ends up only making things worse.
3,a lil reminder,"This was just a book whose, to tell the truth, coverart caught my eye after reading a few other reviews. I lived in the SouthEast of England for the ""good part"" of my adolescence and though heroin was never so easy to see i suppose i never really took a close look. Of course in the late 80s/early90's the street drug and choice of kids my age was Ectasy. A positive, the real life language was great (and the lil glossary of terms in the back really made me giggle), a negative: I never quite made it so far as to touch me, or even care all too much at all."
4,Enjoyable and Captivating,"The book has quite a unique format as each chapter is from the perspective of a different character. Their slow transformation is captivating and the book was hard to put down at times. Be careful though...if you start reading it, you'd better FINISH it, or else you could turn to the big H..yup, the author makes it sound that good in the beginning....mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, SMACK!"
4,Scary because it's real,"This is such a sad story. Set in the last quarter of the 20th century in the United Kingdom, Tar runs away from home because his father is physically abusive and his mother is emotionally abusive. His girlfriend, Gemma, follows him, mainly because she is bored at home.The kids, as they say, get caught up in the wrong crowd. As the title suggests, the wrong crowd includes heroin.""Smack"" is well-written. There is no ONE protagonist; just about everyone involved in the story tells a chapter or two. It carries the book to the end.Reading the book, I was torn between an intrigue for smack; and a total horror, wondering which character would die.This book should be strongly recommended to young adults -- not necessarily for its message, but because it is incredibly well-written without explicit sex, drugs, or language, and it will STILL appeal to the audience."
3,"great subject matter, but written to appeal to young teens","A good book, dealing mainly around two teenage runaways and their decent into drugs and homelesness. A good plot line, but dissapointlingly too similar to the movie/book Trainspotting. Smack is a definate good read for younger teens, but myself, a sixteen year old, felt it reads like something a 13 year old would write. The over simplifying of word use really took away from the story. If possible, you might want to read Trainspotting, for a very similar story but with a bit moe advanced writing technique."
5,Amazing,I think this is one of the greatest books ever written. I picked this book up because of the name i never put it down. It has definiely had a great impact on my life and i symphathize with anyone who is addicted to heroin.
3,Harsh Reality,"Not usually the type of book I enjoy or would ever write a review on a novel about the reality of drug use. Two typical teenagers who believe life is bad with their parents restrictions, run away and become squatters in abandoned houses. The heroin rush overwhelms their life and they become the protypical junkies, living hit to hit, day by day. With friends dying constantly from overdose the reality finally sets in when they take heroin of the body a dead friend.The first person style of wiriting was enjoyable for awhile but hampered me down as the book progressed. Also, the graphic nature of the writing left little to the imagination, which on some occasions, I would rather have been a little naive.All in all it was a very well written story that shows the horrific effects of heroin addiction."
5,awesome book,i just finished reading this book and it was absolutely awesome. very cheap came very fast!-hollywood
4,Hooking as the drug itself.,An honest look into the life of a few addicts with the young love that made even my heart break when all went pear-shaped. This book is a perfect look into a world different from my own. And even a little glossary at the end of the book for little ol' American me. a wonder.
5,Wonderfully written and compelling to all who read it!!,Smack is a smack in the face!! I couldn't put the book down. Lily is one of the best characters!! She lets you know your beautifull in everything you do! Gemma and Tar's realationship is so compelling you want to keep reading to know if they'll stay together! Get the book it is wonderfull!!
3,More than a heroin story,"Being a forensics nurse, working in correctionals, I am always searching for information about heroin and other drugs. I was intitially intrigued with this story line as it seemed to represent the beginning of the disease itself. Heroin is huge now in America, with most of my female inmates intimately familiar with the drug. This novel was targeted for Young Adults, which I have some reservations about. It romanticized the process more than I feel is appropriate. The issue of runaways is important, however I rarely see them so well taken care of. Usually they are brutally exploited, where the characters in this novel were fortunate to fall into the hands of indivduals that tried to protect them. There is alot of content to consider. This is not a book that relates a huge source of information about heroin abuse, it is more of a peripheral story of many social situations affecting youngsters and those that never stop living on the fringes of danger and decadence."
1,Smack is Whack,"This is undeniably the worst book I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Even more offensive then the monotonous writing technique, the story line is excruciatingly predictable, with muddled unidentifiable characters, all of which have vague personal motives devoid of genuine emotional profundity or complexities. For the most part, the characters behave like complete idiots. They do not translate to real life. The writer's lack of bias comes across as feeble narrative. I don't recommend this book. I especially do not recommend it for adolescent readers because it falls perilously short of realistically articulating the horrors of actual drug addiction."
3,Smack,"The book smack was a good but, it has its good and bad parts and confusing.Its about a girl who runs away from home with this boy to live in abandoned places with other runaway teens."
2,Boring!,"I skipped a lot of pages in this book looking for something interesting.After this, I'm not even going to read Junk."
4,Smacking your lips for a good read?,"Smack was an interesting book. Gemma and Tar are two teenagers that any teen could relate to. Gemma's father doesn't approve of Tar or the crowd he hangs out with. She just wants independence. Tar parents are both alcoholics, his father beats him and his mom uses him. Finally he can't take it anymore and he just wants out. He runs away and Gemma soon follows. While staying in a squat they meet a punk couple named Lily and Rob. From then on their life changes forever. While living with them they begin using drugs. Denial and attempts to be clean ensue.This book gives insight to what it might be like to fall under the power of drugs, the way it can run your life. Its a little scary that to see just how easy it all begins.I recommend this book to all you who looking for a good read."
5,THE LOW DOWN ON SMACK,All I can say is...WOW! This book was to the point and descriptive. It kept me wanting to read more! It is the lecture that my parents have been trying to give me only better. It made me understand how strong an addiction is. With every chapter switching between characters Burgess really gives you a clue of how the addiction affected each person. I liked how the reader got to have everyone's point of view on everything. I enjoyed getting everyone's perception of life. I think this is actually the first book I have ever liked and or wanted to read. Overall very well developed and written! It definitely gets my approval!
5,heartbreaking,"this book was so good i read it in a few days, i couldnt put it down and neither will you. if you like drama and realistic looks into our often ugly world, you will love this book. wonderful writing. this story is painful.. it is not sugar-coated, so be prepared. i would recommend it to teens as well as college-age on up."
4,A Literary Smack in the Face,"I was in line at Barnes and Noble when I first discovered 'Smack.' It was on sale and, intrigued by the title, I bought it. I was reading other books at that time but I soon was so hooked on 'Smack' that I decided to take a break on the other ones and devote my full attention to 'Smack.' I enjoyed it because it was a story, not a sermon. It was also a fast, easy read that didn't talk down to its readers even though the majority of its readers are probably 13. Anyway, this book was fascinating and horrifying. It gives a inside view of a life of addiction."
3,Another boring book...,"Much like Pure Sunshine (Brian James, PUSH), this book focuses on druggie teenagers. However, this shows life after and somewhat before the addiction. It also demonstrates the dangers of heroin and other highly-addicting drugs.I had the impression that Melvin Burgess was trying a little bit too hard to make his writing sound up-to-date. While the subculture references were somewhat dated and stale, he did manage to infuse the typical Punk anarchist mindset quite well.The book started to become quite lacking during the middle, and because of this it only gets a 3."
2,"""Kids, just say NO to 'Smack'""","Wow... what a fresh, original concept... two babes-in-the-woods runaways shack up with two caring people named Vonny and Richard, but the babes are lulled by two pathetic junkies named Lily and Rob, so begins a predictable descent into criminal activity, stealing, prostitution, etc. for ""just one fix."" until one of the kids has a revelation and goes straight. If you haven't heard this story (a million times before), then ""Smack"" is the book for you. As far as I'm concerned, the only entertainment I could get out of this MTV-generation book was watching the snotty characters' own self-inflicted downward spiral."
1,Oh My God ! ! ! ! !,"This is such a terrible book! I stopped in the middle of the book and I probably won't finish it because it is soooooooooo boring. I really don't like it. The story is too slow. I read the other reviews and it said it is about a girl and her boyfriend who have heroin addictions that live out on the streets but so far she has just been out on the street with her boyfriend. If I ever do get through this book and my opinion changes, I will apologize for this review and write a new one but I really don't think that's going to happen. I have reviewed about 7 books and this is the first one I am not giving 5 stars to. Don't read this book."
2,hmmmm....,"the way its written, i cant get into it. im only like on page 20 something and i just gave up on it because i have no clue why lol I just cannot make myself get into this book!"
5,read this when i was 15 loved it!,this is a real eye opener for teens I read this when I was 15 an I had many friends who where into drugs and running away I WAS NOT ONE OF THEM.. after reading this I understood how my friends thought an why they did what they did it made me sad for them an also inspired my anti-drug and runaway goup I am proud to say I handed this book out in our first meeting an 95% of my group quit drugs an made up with there parents an have since moved on to better lives with great jobs an some are married with children now I recremend this to troubled teens and or parents with troubled teens to help better understand what they are going through an the teens learn the fast life isnt always glitz and glamor!
5,wicked,"This book is my favorite book ever. I know that there are many people who thought this book was just barly touching the subject; this book has gone further into the situation that many think. I was addicted to Crystal meth...never tryed heroine, but had friends that were addicted to it! This book made me realize that i can quit Meth, if there are people that have quit heroin that i can quit meth... Meth and Herioine are equaly as difficult to quit! Anybody who doesnt agree, is wrong. It is a proved fact! This book was great, i love how they had different peoples point of views. I have read some peoples comments, that said all the people were the same. That is true to a certain extent. Trust me i saw the difference between the characters, but because of the drug people do tent to think the same things. I know from experience! This book is writen amazingly. Melvin Burgees is a great writer. I would buy any book by him!"
4,Power Shift,"Power Shift:Energy+Sustainability A video concerning the energy we choose to use even though we as a nation realizes that there is a much better, safer and cleaner energy to keep us alive and to support our increasing population. I realize that this video was directed to the present generation and in my view this video gives this generation the opporunity to use the information discussed to move away from fossil fuels to following natures law. Action is neccessary to achieve change. I really enjoyed the film and the way the various actors gave their information concerning green power. I felt enlighed and hopefull that change is neccesary and possiable that are planet will have the opportunity to contine to exist."
5,You'll Feel Like You're There!,"Once you've perused the pages of this book, you'll feel like you walked with the moonwalkers. It is absolutely beautiful. If you want to experience it for yourself, this is the book. They say one picture is worth a thousand words...this book proves it."
1,32000 Pictures?,"The Apollo missions yielded over 32,000 extraordinarily beautiful photographs of man's journey to the moon and back. Where are they? I can't believe these pictures are the best NASA has to offer. For those of you with high expectations, save your money. This book is a serious letdown."
4,Nice But Not Amazing,"From the description and other reviews I was expecting to be dazzled by these original photos which were beautifully/chronologically arranged. Aside from a few shots taken from the ground on Earth or from on board cameras of the rockets and astronauts, it was focused mainly on just the areas where the astronauts walked and is mediocre resolution at best. I was expecting/hoping for overhead/angled pictures of many other areas and there weren't that many. A lot of close up shots of things like moonrocks which look just like earth rocks and moon grit and equipment. Those Hasselblad cameras were terrible and I was hoping for more satellite and orbit pics. Still, if youre really into the Apollo moon missions and others like that you will enjoy this book. Big book."
5,Wow,"The picture number 78 is worth the price of the book. I worked on the Apollo program, however, NASA never shared these images with any of us."
5,The greatest picture book ever created!,Michael Light is nothing short of a master!And he left _all_ the captions off. Yes!
4,"Wonderful, but poorly linked","This fine book, while quite wonderful,has been done a dis-service by it's presenters by failing to provide a link to the very best of all moon information books: THE MOON BOOK by Kim Long (ISBN 1-55566-230-7)"
2,Disappointing,"32 000 photos to choose from, and this is what he comes up with?? Many of the pictures are black and white, out of focus and grainy. The panorama shots are very poorly composited from smaller pictures. I’ve seen much better seamless versions of the same photo series in other books. Numerous pages are simply empty. Just black. There are many great photos in this book, but they are too few to make it a good buy. A few google searches will turn up many more great photos than you will find in this book."
4,The best space picture book ever,"This is a fantastic book! Who would have thought to use actual NASA negatives, a little photo technology, and presto, create a stunning book of Apollo photos? This is a great addition to anyone's personal library. However, I was slightly dissappointed. It says that the author wanted to avoid the more famous pictures, like the one of Buzz Aldrin on the moon. But why? I think the famous ones need to be seen like you are actually there instead of yellowed fourth and fifth generation duplicates more than the ""never-before-published"" photos. Other than that small dissapotinment, you ought to get it."
5,You'll want to frame it and hang it on your wall,"As a graphic artist I know great printing when I see it. This book represents some of the best black and white photo printing I have ever seen in a book. It is great as a coffee table book (your guests wont be able to put it down without seeing every page), and it is even better as a centerpiece to your bookshelf. Michael Light has true talent as a digital artist by beautifully restoring and sharpening these historical photos of the NASA Apollo missions. I look forward to picking up a copy of his other book '100 Suns' in which he restores what were once classified military images of above-ground nuclear weapons tests. I am confident I will be as satisfied with it as I am with 'Full Moon.'"
4,"Interesting Read, but a little one sided for a PHD project","I wanted to understand the ""emerging church movement"" from a friendly or inside perspective and this book is great for that purpose. I think it is too fond of the movement from the outset to be considered completely objective, but it does provide a lot of background explanations and uses a lot of actual quotes and examples from the movement.As a side note, I find a lot of things that I agree with in these writings in terms of shortcomings with today's church and even today's believers; however I do not think that redefining Jesus, the kingdom of God, or scripture to better fit our needs is a good way to do anything but fall even farther away from Jesus."
2,Look elsewhere...,"A highly tendencious piece that promotes the myth that the USA ""Won"" the war and ignores critical pieces of evidence. A prime example of the US media's inability to be objective about US history.Buy a book such as Donald Hickey's, and some hot chocolate, and have an early night instead."
5,Great book,I love the author of these books. So well written and there is always a surprise towards the end that you don't see coming. I would highly recommend his writting.
3,Conjures Up A B-rated Movie,"A friend suggested reading Sandford and so I did with this particular story. It develops suspense and I did want to know who the terrible villain was, but as it turned out the perp seemed almost incidental to all that happened. I was reminded of B-rated movies and how their characters always fall short of the mark. In this case, the investigating detective did not, but the killer had no such luck."
5,Best Lucas Davenport novel,"I had trouble putting this book down. It was a wild ride of thrills, chills and suspense. One of John Sanfords best.."
2,WINTER PREY,"Of all the Sandford books,these were his early ones and Cassettonly, Winter Prey and Shadow prey just didn't do it for me,and I love Sandford."
4,Best Of The Prey Series,"Lucas Davenport ain't never going to be Harry Bosch, but he's a good enough morally ambivalent character that you care about what he does and why he does it. Of the Prey series, this is a standout for its plot about ugly sexual behavior in the sticks and for its detailed evocation of Minnesota in the dead (no pun intended) of winter. Mystery aficionados already know this book, and they'll tell you that another great thing about it is that Sandford plays fair with the plot. Things get strange, but there's a logical thread throughout. Superior reading for long-distance air travel."
4,Good Edition in the Sandford Series,"This was engaging and kept me guessing till the end. Well written, even though the attaction between Lucas and Weather seemed kind of forced."
3,Not the best BUT NECESSARY,"I did not really care too much for the story line of this book. It really seemed to drag on. But if you are like me and once you find a writer you like, you need to read them all in order so that you can keep up with the progress of the character. This book adds several life changing additions to the character which may not make sense if you read other books and skip this one."
3,Iced,"Once again John Sanford brings you in to his world with Lucas Davenport and the always colorful murderer. In this novel, we are faced with a small town and a big secret. No one will be uneffected. With the twists and turns of a rollercoaster, you feel the emotions of the killer and his prey. Even though you are safe in you warm home, you still feel the ice cold while reading this twisted novel."
1,Too gruesome,"I will not be reading any more of his books. Certain Prey was not too bad, but Winter Prey was way too gruesome and sick for me. I don't mind a little violence,but this book did not leave me feeling glad I read it!"
4,Quick Moving Action Book,I could not put this book down. It was quick paced and very intriguing. Many twists and turns. Had you guessing from page one.
4,John Sandford Winter Prey,"My sister lives in MN so of course, she had to get me hooked on the prey series of books by John Sandford. Somehow, I was always chilly when reading this one."
1,Winter Prey,"I'm sorry to say I stopped reading this book at chapter 2 because I didn't like the start of the book & it didn't hold my interest. The only book in this series I enjoyed was Rules of Prey. Books 2,3,4,&5 wasn't interesting to me I hope book 6 is better."
2,"Davenport Does ""Winter in Peyton Place""","I found this book EXTREMELY TEDIOUS.The characters are FLAT, including his love interest, and uninteresting compared to the other Davenport books I have read. No wonder the murders/kiddie porn are such fodder for discussion in this podunk town, the citizens have nothing to do and nothing to keep themselves entertained. They need to get a life. Wish Davenport would just go back to Minneapolis and get on with it. Surely the twin cities could keep him busy? I am disappointed and SO GLAD that I checked this turkey out from the local library."
1,PLEASE!!,"A sad mess. Stilted dialogue. Awkward sentence structure. Predictable piece of junk.Not a nuance from beginning to end. Not a suggestion of humor. No insights into motivation,or character development.How can this be published when there are great books out there by Ruth Rendel, PD James, and even Robert Parker who can make you laugh and think?I am amazed that other reviews on this page say that this is Sandford's best. Maybe it is; but I will never know."
4,An avid reader,"As someone who reads a lot (out side of school) I love Shakespeare. So I was quite glad to see this on my reading list for school! I already have this in a set of other shakepeare books, but if you have to read any of his work for school, go with the no fear. I have a few no fear varieties, and love how you can read the old English, with normal English."
1,Translation is Raunchy,"I love Taming of the Shrew, don't get me wrong. However, I hated this modern English translation. Shakespeare is rich and full of innuendo, but this version takes it directly to the gutter. I had to return all nine copies that I bought for my high school English students, since the translation rendered it unreadable for teenagers. Amazon's return policy took away the sting of having to send everything back. The process was easy and I received my refund quickly."
5,A Sonic Masterpiece,"Just as Sgt Pepper was to the Beatles, the album Collage was the artistic peak for PR&R. It was lead singer Mark Lindsay's masterpiece, as it was he who was the mastermind behind this ""tour de force"". Even the bastion of hipdom & counter-culture at the time, Rolling Stone Magazine, gave this album a glowing review upon it's release in 1970, and praised Lindsay for his efforts. Forget the pop sounding singles that immediately preceded this album : Led Zeppelin & Uriah Heep come to mind, when one spins this CD. Each track has been so exquisitely arranged & executed. Nothing seems out of place. Nothing seems lacking. Brilliant. Simply Brilliant. Definitely number 1 on my ""desert isle"" classic list."
1,Poorly arranged synthesizer music,"Avoid this CD unless you enjoy poorly arranged synthesizer music. This is one of those releases that appears to be a ""greatest hits"" of sorts, until you notice that it is not performed by the original artist. Some of those types of releases are at least tolerable; this one is terrible. First, it is all synthesized. Second, the arrangements aren't even accurate. I know the Star Wars theme like the back of my hand, and this ""artist"" manages to mangle it worse than a sixth-grade school band. I actually have a copy that I was going to sell, until I listened to it. No one should be subjected to this kind of torture."
4,Perfect for mothers day,I buy a group of these every year for my mom for mothers day. She loves them and enjoys seeing them bloom year after year.
1,"Does not fit if your all Fiscars 12"" cutters",My cutter has a mat refill that is MUCH thicker than this one. It did not fit.Check the thickness of your mat before you order. if it's more than a 1/4 inch this one will not work.
5,SCI FI CLASSICS VI,"THIS SET OF DVDS WAS GREAT. I LOVE THE OLD, SORT OF CHEESY, MOVIES AND THEY PROVIDED LOTS OF LAUGHS AND REMEMBERANCES FROM MY CHILDHOOD MOVIE VIEWING. IF YOU LIKE OLD SCI-FI MOVIES, YOU'LL LOVE THESE."
5,exercise + diet = controlled arthritis...,"...Extremely informative for all, regardless of your health. Miriam Nelson has done it again not only with her easy reading style, but with very educational and informative text. I'm going to send as a gift to a friend."
1,Old and Dangerous,"I will not purchase these blades ever again. Upon receiving, I noticed that the packaging was slightly faded and when you open up the actual blades, the gel coating (the strip of green/blue) had actually MELTED on some parts of the blades. This concludes that the storage facility of these products are not the best of conditions, which will harm the performance of the actual blades against your hair.It gave me cuts and provided a more intense sting on the facial skin than blades usually do.Avoid."
1,Dull blades,"A friend told me that he buys his shaving blades from Amazon so I gave it a try. It was cheaper. But not by much once shipping was included. These Mach 3 were the worst blades I ever used. I have been shaving with the Mach 3 for many years and although these blades were new in the box, every one of them hurt my face. All 16 of them. It seemed like they were defective or something and I had to throw them all away. Will not buy blades from here again. I never had a problem with the same blades bought from a retail store."
1,Warning: fake blades!,"The blades sold by this seller are fake! You should never buy any blades from this seller, he/she is not honest at all.Trying to use these blades would be impossible, they are as good as a scraper. An old kitchen knife would do a better job. For more information, see this website: http://fakeblades.wordpress.com/"
2,mach3 blades,"I have used Mach3 shaving blades for many years. This is the first time I bought blades online thru Amazon. I can clearly see the difference between store bought Mach3 and the ones from Amzon. I DONT THINK THESE ARE ORIGINAL MACH3 BLADES. THEY ARE INFERIOR QUALITY BLADES. I AM DISAPPOINTED, NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM AMAZON."
5,Great Deal/Sharp S(h)avings,"Now a days the price of Mach 3 replacement blades are through the roof. I purchased the 16 pack through Amazon and saved at least 30% off from big box or super drugstore chains. They are so expensive these days that the retail stores keep them under lock and key. These are the origional, no knock offs and they are the best deal I have found. When I run low on the blades I will reorder from Amazon."
3,"Nice shave, but razors don't last","These razors give a nice shave, but my husband only gets one or two shaves from each blade. He has a very rough beard and loves these razors, but these blades are way too expensive to wear out so quickly."
1,Fake product,"I thought I had hit upon a bargain with the price listed. But then when I took the first swipe, it was clear that I was stupid to buy this. With the original Mach 3 blade, the shave is always smooth, the blade seems sharp. At the end of the shave I can feel the skin being clean of stubble. Not with this. Something is not right with the blade. I am scared to glide the blade along my chin as the movement is very rough and stubborn. The package and the blade all seem normal but definitely the blade is not even passable quality. Avoid this like a bad shave."
2,Faux pac,"If you bought these from Shaverman, you got shaved. These are not the original American Mach3 blades, but some substandard or foreign knock-off. Guys, you get what you pay for. These are cheap because they are not as good as the real thing. Cough up for the real thing, for the sake of your face."
5,Best Book,I had over three years experience in Solaris platform. Then I planned to give certification and I choose this book and completed my certfication Part I and Part II with 73%. I learned lot of things from this book which I wasn't know in my practical experience. It covers all the topics and will definitely help you to pass the exams. I like the way Exam Cram follow to explain the things.
3,Useful book,"This book is certainly useful in passing Suns certification tests. I used this book in my preperation for the Part I and Part II tests, which I passed. However in my opinion additional reading and real experience is required to pass these examinations."
3,"Cute shoes, narrow, and a bit big though",These shoes are adorable and I wish I couldve kept them! They were just a bit too big for a usual size 7 and they were also very narrow!
2,Not the best choice,"I wasn't too impressed with this book. This may sound silly but I like cookbooks with pictures, especially ones for kids so they can pick out what they like. On top of that I found a lot of the receipes complicated or just something so different my toddler would turn his nose up at it. I wouldnt recommend this book, there are betters out there."
1,Disappointing,"I was definitely disappointed in this book - my picky toddler won't even try things that he doesn't recognize, and is far more likely to eat things that have a lot of flavor than these bland recipes. Most of the things didn't even sound great to ME, so I am still on the hunt for a good for you, tastes good book that will satisfy my picky eater."
1,Tasteless,"I am raising my child (18 months) as a vegan and was looking forward to tasty recipes without refined flour, sugar, salt, etc. This is not the book for anything ""tasty."" I was disappointed that most of the vegetarian recipes had milk and cheese. I made the Sunny Squares recipe. It was so bland, I had to throw it all away. And who in their right mind would suggest a recipe with turmeric in it for a toddler? Do you know how much that yellow spice stains clothing, carpets, etc? I do not recommend this book."
4,"Looks great, but not until my daughter turns 1","I bought this book because at 8 months, my daughter rejected all baby food and only wants to feed herself, and I was having a very difficult time getting her to eat any protein at all.The recipes look amazing, but almost all of them include milk and/or eggs to hold the ingredients together. You can substitute formula or breast milk for the milk (which she does point out in the book), but I was told by my doctor to wait to give her egg yolks at 10 months, and absolutely no egg whites until 1 year.I did cook the tuna & spinach patty cakes (using formula), which she loved! It was amazing to see her happily eat protein and vegetable in one meal. But fish is supposed to be given only once a week at this age... I can see this book will probably get lots of use when she turns 1."
4,A Steiner classic,"This book is easy to read and understand. Of course enlightenment will not come from books but knowledge can. Wisdom is seeing through things while knowledge is seeing things as they are. I highly recommend this book to all who want to learn the mysteries of the universe, it is factual and precise as a Mercedes Benz (Steiner is of germanic stock)."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I purchased this for our business and once I received it I immediatly sent it back. Outside the fact that it was very cheap materials (should have know since it was cheaply priced), it was also poorly manufactured. The sides were bowed and we couldn't even put it together with it leaning. It would have been worth it to spend a little bit more and get a quality product."
3,Pretty Pricey for Cardboard,"This piece does exactly what it's supposed to do... serving as a good storage unit for papers, mail, etc.It's just a little cheaply built for the price they charge.-- Sides are melamine coated pressboard (the cheap stuff)-- Internal dividers are corrugated cardboard. Thinner than a shipping box.-- Back is 1/8 inch cardboard, held on by nails.-- I was able to drive the nails through the back and into the sides of the unit using only my fingers--that's how weak it is.Includes labels, glue for the dowel pins, and clear instructions too. This is the highest quality part of the operation.Went together in about 15 minutes and I didn't have any tools. Have a hammer? 10 minutes tops....BUT its one of the least expensive ones out there, so, what are you gonna do, ya know?"
3,Mail Slots,"I tried this purchase three times. The first time it was a cardboard type material and was not satisfactory for out need. Called a rep and got a replacement item which was the same material. Called again and got a much better product although the shelved are not secure when removing mail from another mail box.Despite the situation, the customer service as A+. Exceptional service so thank you!!!"
4,Everything I wanted to know about the new TIFF-JPEG.,"Some developers have migrated from the lossless, and excellent compression subtype, LZW, within TIFF (for litigious/royalty reasons) to the TIFF with subtype JPEG lossless compression for their imaging needs. This reference does the MOST excellent job of steering a developer and product management AWAY from that decision (Spec 6 prior to Note 2). Several other areas of the reference were invaluable also, but this particular one was a life-saver."
3,Great Reference for Formats of Yesterday,"This is what you expect, a comprehensive reference of graphic file formats. Some of the formats were great standards in their glory days, like FLI files of the DOS days, or other Atari, Amiga, OS/2 oriented standards. Missing are obviously the new formats like PNG and anything after early 90s are just absent. The book despereately calls for a new version, and I pray it be in a PDF format, as paper-based references clutter the household...The included CD includes Spyglass Mosaic 2.x (pre-Netscape and pre-IE browser), source code, and references in postscript format."
5,great tea!,I love this tea...just enough mint for a delicious but not overpowering taste and green tea for health. So glad it's here as it's almost impossible to find in the local stores.
5,Good tea,I bought this tea for my mother and she says it is the best green tea. She likes to drink it especially in the summer.
2,Used to be my favorite tea.,"This used to be my favorite tea. I have had it on subscribe and save for years. However, Celestial Seasonings has changed the recipe and it isn't nearly as good. It isn't as minty and has a weaker green tea flavor. There is new box art which says now with white tea. If I want white tea, I will buy that! Why change a perfect product??"
4,A Little Heavy on the Spearmint,"I bought this tea because I love Celestial Seasonings Green Tea, Decaf Candy Cane tea, which is only available at the holidays and I thought it would be a close match. It is close, but it has more spearmint and less peppermint than I would have preferred."
3,A little disappointed,"My hopes were very high for receiving this book based on the title, however it did not live up to my expectations. This book says it gives strategies but in actuality I did not find it to give real concrete ideas and plans for dealing with specific problems. The real life scenerious were helpful if you were also dealing with that specific scenerio in your own teens life. I have read a couple books on teens and this was the least helpful."
3,I didnt get to read it,"I lent it to a friend of mine who thought it was fabulous, she never gave it back!I think she found it beneficial."
1,Total garbage,"The category of book is greatly misleading. It should be ""alternative reality fantasy"" or something. Any page of the book has something really strange. Plastic bags did not exist in Russia in 1941. Any two-years old child will die after 250 grams of vodka, even Russian. And so on, any part of this story sounds equally unrealistic. Probably the writer been born in Russia but knows less then nothing about it. Characters and their behavior are so strange too, it looks like you read a badly written transcript of bad dream.Do not waste your time."
2,Came highly recommended and was highly disappointing,I have had quite a few friends beg me to read this novel. So when I was given a copy for my birthday I was looking forward to it. However I had to wade through the truly terrible first 250 pages before the editing and the writing improved. I adore historical books - though I tend to read far more non-fiction - and some scenes were well researched and beautifully crafted. It was almost like there was a change in editor at this point too!The story is good. The writing is excellent in parts and laughable in its weaker parts. It gets truly terrible and I felt like picking up my pen and editing it myself!I am so surprised at the number of rave reviews. This novel could not decide what genre it truly was. I was looking for a lot more than this book offered. Do yourself a favour and pick one of the greats instead of this. If I could found out who edited it I would avoid them too!
5,Dominated my life for 3 days!!!,"I am a fan of Diana Galbadon and truly enjoy historical fiction. This author did not go into as much detail as Diana Galbadon, but that was fine with me. The detail she included gave me a very accurate vision of life in Leningrad at the time. I LIVED this book for 3 days while reading it and got far too little sleep. I was also very emotional during that time, thinking about the book even when I wasn't reading. I did have some questions about why Tatiana does what she does, but felt they were explained enough as I moved through the story. The best part? The love story...I have a lump in my throat just thinking about it...On to book 2 (after I get a few chores done around here!):)"
5,Fabulous,Couldn't put this book down. Fascinating story hi-lighting the terrors of war. Beautiful love story only 2/3rds of the way through.
3,Long,The novel seemed to drag on and on with little happening. I personally like a little more action. The book was true to history.
5,Unforgettable love story that leaves you yearning for the next book,"I love historical romances and this one is perhaps the best I have read. I literally could not put it down and stayed up until dawn to devour every page, because I was dying to know what happened next.The reviewers who complained that the book is not well-written are not wrong. It's not exactly poetic prose but the book is still unbelievably enthralling because you develop such a strong connection to the characters in the book.The second book, Alex and Tatiana, is even MORE addictive. If you like romance stories, this series is definitely not to be missed."
2,Hard going,"This story did not ring true for me too many impossible scenarios for me to take it seriously, hope it's not going to be a film"
5,Stayed up all night!,"The Bronze Horseman is the first book in a long time that has kept me up until the wee hours of the morning. I flew through the book. Generally I don't read romance but this book is a riveting mix of outstanding, ""real"" characters and beautifully written language. It has tons, and tons of depth. In addition to the heart rendering love story and the well crafted personalities that dominate the story, it paints a meaningful and truthful picture of life under the communist ""ideal"". The ending has me not wanting to leave the characters and hoping that there is a Part II coming soon!"
5,Excellent and overwhelming,"Just thought I quickly write my first ever review of the book. This book has motioned my feeling in so many ways and times, that even now, that I have long started reading another book I still keep thinking about Bronze Horseman and will be re-reading it some time soon. When I first bought this book, I thought that it may not be my ""thing"", that maybe it will involve too many war details etc. But to my surprise, it didn't. It was an excellent read, all the way through, that made my trips to work every morning and evening (which usually take 40 mins) seem like a second long."
1,I didn't like anyone is this book and didn't care what happened to them,This book is frequently recommended to people who like the Outlander Series by Diana Gabaldon. This was NOTHING like that series.
4,great read,Very entertaining.Looking forward to reading the next adventures of Tania & Alexander.Enjoyed reading about life in Russia during war time.
3,"a triolggy wasn't necessary, should have stopped while ahead..;ist book very good excellent desriptions....got bored with 2nd bo",if you just read 1st book that should satisfy you...after that it gets boring did like descriptions of Leningrad during war.
5,"An amazing, epic story","Friends of mine raved about this book for the last year, but I always hesitated because somewhere along the way I had heard it was depressing--it is set in WWII Russia, how much more depressing can it be? Thankfully, my friends prevailed upon me and I finally read it. I was utterly blown away...consumed! The story is about first love, sacrifice, loyalty, betrayal, and perseverence. From the first chapter, I couldn't put it down. I've read Tatiana and Alexander as well, and recommend that anyone considering reading The Bronze Horseman have Tatiana & Alexander nearby because you will put one down when finished and immediately NEED to read the other. It's a masterpiece!"
5,GREAT!!!!,"I loved this book. I had a friend recommend it to me. I could not put it down. I was dissappointed at the ending until I read the reviews saying there is a sequel, now I can't wait to get that book."
5,epic,"Love this novel set in Russia during WW11. I owned this book for some time before deciding to tackle it. Can't image why-now that I read it. It is a hard to put down novel about the love between Tatiana and Alexander during the war. The hardships they face along the way are unbearable. It makes me think twice when I throw food away now. The first time the two lovers are finally physically together had me panting and remembering that ""first"" time a long time ago. I highly recommend this novel."
5,Destined to become a classic!,"The Bronze Horseman is an emotional tour de force. I could not put it down. The characters and setting leapt off the page and transported me back to war-torn Russia. The relationship between the two main charcters, Tatiana and Alexander, is tender and passionate, heart-breaking, and yet, triumphant. Add to this the amazing histoical detail and you have a novel of epic proportions that you will always remember."
2,Sucks,"While the writing is fine, 500 pages of an 800+ page book spent on 'this love is wrong' while people are starving to death and a war is going on is an idiot book. Save yourself real grief and skip this stupid book."
2,Just sad,"It's not that this book isn't well written, it is just so depressing. And by that I mean the whole book, not just certain parts. Do not read if you are looking for something uplifting - this isn't it. I actually wish I had not read it because it makes me sad just to think about it. I won't read the sequels - I would need Prozac!"
3,"Great love story, but far-fetched","I absolutely could not put this book down. The love story in the setting of World War II Leningrad really captured me. The only problem with it was how I felt after I had finished it. The ending was one of those that looked to me like the author said to herself, ""I've written 600 pages, so now it's time to end this book."" So she tidied it up in the most unlikely scenario. This is the most unbelievable heroine ever. This book should be listed as ""Fantasy."""
2,A Romance Novel in disguise.,"The characters were much too idealized for what at first seemed like it was going to be a classic Russian novel of romance in war. The ""perfect"" Alexander and the ever-naive, always giving Tatia became annoying though - particularly Tatia whose devotion to her sister and family eventually appears incredibly dysfunctional.Others have said it well: these two over shadow the rest of the story, including the historical content -- but take WAY too long to get together, while the reader suffers through a dance of emotional foreplay that becomes simply irritating. It's Cinderella rescued by a prince all over again. Alexandria may not be a prince but the author has made him as close to one as possible in the oppressive atmosphere of war. A prince with creme brulee eyes and a six pack, no less."
5,Good book,"This is a really good book. Someone who loved the Twilight series loved this book as well, so I gave it a try and I loved it too. Make sure to read the rest of the series: 2nd book - ""Tatiana and Alexander"". 3rd book - ""The Summer Garden"""
5,WOAH!,"This is one of the best books I'v read in my life to date! I ran across a recomendation for it on a Diana Gabaldon site. The Outlander series is beloved to me and I can't help but compare everything to it. Although this is a very different sort of yarn ,this story is heartbreaking, gut wrenching,romantic,It has it all!It's the first of a trilogy. I ordered them all and was not disappointed. These will stay on my bookshelf forever and I will read them again and again.A modern day classic."
5,Review of 'The Bronze Horseman',I have been waiting for a book I could not put down and this book was everything I needed and more. I was utterly captivated from the first page to the last.
5,"A ""can't put down"" book!",Second time reading this book & I still can't put it down! Luv luv luv Alexander & Tatiana!!! would luv to see this turned into a movie.
2,A sad end,This book started off so well. Telling a story of Leningrad. What a shame the author could not maintain it. About half way it drops into drivel!
5,The real Soviet Communism,"This is a powerful love story set in the WW2 era of Stalinism, with no holds held on what the failures of Marxist Communism enspoused. Life was extremely hard and the Stalinists were exceedingly cruel. Actually Communism as Marx saw it was not what Stalin did; he applied the dictatorship of the proletariet and because of human nature, never got past that stage. Marxist Communism never happened there.Nevertheless, the characters Tania and Alexander were developed into real and interesting persons. Tania was an angel; Alexander was a hero. I liked this book and went on to read the two succeeding books about Tania and Alexander as a result. I recommend this book as a glance into waht the Soviets endured during the bloody and cruel Stalin era."
3,Review of The Bronze Horseman and Tatiana and Alexander by Paullina Simons,I read this book and listened to the book tape some while ago. I liked this book so much I wanted to add it to my kindle library so I could read it again. I also read Tatiana & Alexander by this same author and loved it too. I was sorry to have these books end they were that good. I hope you will offer other books by this author. I want to give this a 5 star rating.
5,I loved this book,"This is one of my all time favourite books, I've read it many times and have passed it on to a lot of friends who have also loved it.If you love this book, you must read The Bridge to Holy Cross, the sequel, which actually runs concurrently with the Bronze Horseman and also completes the story of Tania & Alexander."
3,Great first 1/3rd or so....,"... the 2nd 1/3rd began to drag. I may or not make it though the last 1/3rd. Between some seriously repetitive dialog, an overly (and obnoxiously) dominant male romantic lead, and so much filler I'm clicking quickly through several pages at a time, this one hasn't lived up to expectations (or the reviews.) Your mileage may vary."
5,Best Historical Fiction!!,"Hands down the best historical fiction I've ever read. The characters in this book will forever stay with you. I've gotten everyone I can to read it. So far everyone's reaction has been the same. I'm reading it a 3rd time. Love, love, love it."
4,Good Read!,I enjoyed this book. Most of the book was page turning but there were parts that were long and drawn out. The seige of Leningrad was well written and you felt so bad for the residents and how they suffered. I thought the ending was a bit hurried and was disappointed with it until I realized there was a sequel. All in all in was an enjoyable read.
2,Boring,"I'm sorry, but this was the most boring book I've ever read. It's so repetitive, the author writes about the same thing over and over and over, again and again and again. It was a total waste of time reading this book, I only read half of it and that was enough."
2,The Bronze Horseman Trilogy,"When I began reading the book, I could not put it down. However, as it went on, I found it tedious and difficult to finish and only ploughed on as I have a pet hate NOT to finish reading a book, no matter how boring it is. The book became truly unbelievable (and not in a good way).Imaginary heroines can perform unbelievable achievements but this girl was off the charts.Besides managing to survive starvation, she performed such brave deeds and physically strong activities (and as the fantasy progressed, she was also pregnant while performing with super human strength some of these activities) plus all while suffering with TB.If the physical hardships were not enough, our heroine was so good on an emotional level, she even denied the man she loved and gave him to her sister.She also was quite the sexual athlete.Let's not forget her intellectual capabilities as she became fluent in speaking another language in less than a year.UNBELIEVABLE!"
5,Loved it!,I am always looking for a book to whisk me away and make me want to come back to it all day! This book did that. Loved it!
3,Recommended,"""The Bronze Horseman"" was as educational as it was entertaining. With Hitler's WW II invasion of Leningrad as the backdrop to Tatiana and Alexander's burgeoning relationship, this made for a completely gripping and heart-wrenching story. I recommend this book; however, because the author rambled on ad nauseum about insignificant details in several parts of the book, I rate it 3.5 stars. I guess the editor was MIA. All in all, when this book was good, it was really really good, and when it was bad it was horrid. Still worth the read though."
5,The Bronze Horseman,This is THE BEST SERIES OF ALL TIME. If you have not read these books than you are doing yourself a huge diservice. Words cannot express how wonderful and amazing these books are. These are a definite must read for anyone and everyone. If I could I would give them a million stars. Five just isn't enough
2,Very hard to get into,"I have been trying to hand in there. I have read one of the Author's books before and couldn't put it down. I am awaiting for this to turn to interested. I am not. Also, it was highly recommended. I am giving it to 200 pages and i am at 165!"
1,Tedious and disappointing,"I was excited to find this historical book about the Nazi invasion of Russia, siege of Leningrad, and the resistance and suffering of the Russian people.Sadly it turned out to be long and repetitive, and with the exception of the middle part about the siege itself and how the people of Leningrad fought for survival, this turns out to be little short of a Harlequin romance, with cardboard characters particularly a larger than life perfect hero in Alexander Barrington.It adds nothing to our real understanding of Russia during the war.The endless lovers quarrels between Alexander and Tania, and the endless love scenes of the period before and after their marriage, takes up over 200 pages.Frankly I resent the money and time I spent on it, and would recommend some fine Russian literature about this period instead, such as the Arbat Trilogy by Anatoly Rybakov and Forever Flowing by Vassily Grossman."
1,Shockingly bad,"This is by far the worst book I have ever read. I can't believe how many stars people are giving it! It is such a poorly written piece of work - there were several moments where I read the sentence over and over thinking ""That doesn't seem right""? At one point I even read a paragraph aloud to my husband and we were both shocked that the mistakes weren't picked up during the editing process.The book is long, slow and repetitive. Very, very repetitive. The characters are painfully annoying, particularly the protagonist, and they are all poorly developed. I had to laugh at other reviewers comments about the number of love making scenes - it's completely ridiculous how such a large portion of the book is just riddled with the same scene over and over. Where was the editor on this one?"
1,"Too Dull for the Beach, Too Dumb for Anywhere Else","The Bronze Horseman is one of those big, dumb historical ""epics"" with cardboard characters and lines like ""Breathe on me. Let me smell your blueberry breath.""Obviously, this book is not intended to be great literature, but its historical setting (World War II in Stalin's Russia) is just too grim for silly melodrama.There are far better novels about Russia in the 1930's and World War II such as Generations of Winter by Vassily Aksyonov and The Arbat Trilogy by Anatoli Rybakov."
1,This book is painfully stupid and sappy!,"This is hands down the worst book I have ever read. There is abostuletly no character development, the characters are ..., and as a reader you don't really like or sympathize with any of the characters.... Due to the lack of character development, the story line is implausible and laughable. This book is a poorly written harlequin romance novel set in Russia. Don't waste your time reading it."
5,The best,"This is my favorite book of all time, along with the other 2 in the trilogy. It has been re-read many times and a lot of tears have been shed. I love Paulina's writing style, it completely draws you into the story. A must!"
3,It's ok.,"I have very mixed feelings about this piece of work. I thought it was very well written and enjoyed the story line. It just seemed to long. I felt like I was living the book as long as it took for things to move along. Some of it felt repetative (get up, go to work, fight with parents, long after sisters fiance, repeat) and after a couple of times you start skimming pages to get to the next part."
4,Beautiful Historical novel... but...,"Like another reviewer said, I really wanted to give this novel 5 stars; however, like the other reviewer said, the hundred page sex scene got to be a little much. To me, the word ""nipples"" is funny and not sexy at all! And when it is written forty plus times, session after session, the sex becomes funny, overdone, and far too overwritten.I will say, though, that I am more than happy I read this book and will continue on to the sequel, along with the author's other novels."
5,Breathtaking!,"I couldn't put The Bronze Horseman down. And as soon as I finished it, I read it again, more slowly, to savor it. The book, a story of love and sacrifice in the middle of war, is beautifully written. To the author: PLEASE write a sequel!"
5,Awake All Night,"I loved this book. I picked it up from a supermarket shelf on the basis of a quick read of another Paullina Simons novel. What a treat. The very gradual build up of attraction and passion between the two main characters is gripping. The contrast between the warm human elements and the devastation wreaked upon Leningrad during WW2 serves to heighten the tension. This book evokes feelings of love, pain, tragedy and passion. It made me smile, cry, gasp - and it kept me awake until the small hours and made me wake early to continue reading. I would thoroughly recommend this book for a long, quiet weekend, or for a great holiday read - as long as your companions don't mind being ignored until you've finished!"
4,Emotionally Time Consuming Investment,"I don't even know where to start. This is a very long, descriptive, and wordy book. I stopped and started reading it a few times before I committed to reading the whole thing. The beginning didn't really hook me, but I heard so many good things from a bunch of different blogs about this book so I really wanted to finish it. I am glad that I did. The love between Alexander and Tatiana was a drawn out affair. I got very frustrated waiting to see what would happen to Dasha to make it okay for Alexander and Tatiana to be together. And I was not expecting THAT. I finally really got into about half way through and I cried a ton. Now that I have finished it I am grateful for the author's wordiness. It makes you all the more emotionally invested in the characters and story. I finished it about a week ago and am still mentally pysching myself up to read the second one."
4,This CD ROCKS! IT ROCKS!,My life is now complete! I finally have all the best college football fight songs on one CD!ROLL TIDE!
3,Where's On Wisconsin?,"The cd is great but where is On Wisconsin? On Wisconsin was rated as the 3rd best fight song behind Michigan and Notre Dame. Where is it? FSU included their rival Florida, so why not kick them off the cd and put Wisconsin on it?"
4,This could have been a 5-star CD,"This CD is missing a song!! The University of Washington's ""Bow Down To Washington"" WHERE IS IT? Leaving this song off this CD is like leaving a wheel off your car. It leaves you with a feeling that they ran out of room on the CD. I can't imagine how you the producers of this CD could have left off the U. of Washington's fight song and, in its place chosen schools like Brigham Young, Duke, Iowa and West Virginia. Nothing wrong with those schools...just that when compared to the University of WA, it is like leaving off USC, Michigan, UCLA, Florida, Florida State, Nebraska. I think they should have planned their selection of songs much smarter. Too bad...I would love this CD, but won't buy it without the University of WA fight song. NEXT TIME, PUT ALL FOUR WHEELS ON THE CAR...IT WORKS BETTER THAT WAY."
3,Good for students,I bought this for my armchair science hobby and it's ok for that purpose I suppose. It's more suited for students that are still in school with a fresh understanding of math as that is what physics is mostly. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone just interested in broad scientific knowledge as it's mainly just learning equations and such.
1,Written with errors and poor explanations,"After taking AP Physics and college Physics years ago, I wanted to brush up on my physics. After the first few chapters of this book it was clear the author didn't carefully check the editing stage. There are errors made every so often in key areas that really affect explanations. Not that the explanations are that clear or thorough to begin with. Some drawings are wildly incorrect and not what the author intended. This is a very disappointing book that will not be very helpful to a person trying to learn Physics for the first time. Better to use the book for testing the friction on the sides of your trash can."
3,Pretty good,"It's pretty good, although it could be better. It would have helped to be a little more concise, or to have more examples; really just MORE. It does help, though."
