3,Ease of matching the colors and figures,I played this once with my Granddaughter and I found it difficult to tell the colors and the figures to make a match.
3,Colors are too close together,"This is a great domino set, except the colors are really close together. There is blue and a sort of aqua or teal color that are hard to tell apart unless you are in good light. Also, the peach and orange are also hard to tell apart. My son's grandma got very frustrated playing with him because she couldn't tell the colors apart."
4,Works fine for me.,"First off, if you are using this cable to put things INTO your PSP, don't bother buying this cable until you get a bigger memory card than the 32mb.Mp3's tranferred into my PSP fine with no alterations, I just copied an mp3 from my computer and pasted it into one of the PSP's folders displayed in my computer. Everything you do with this cable will be done through your computer, all the PSP does is stay on and hooked up during the process. You have to put it on ""USB connection"" for your computer to recognize the PSP. After that, go into ""My Computer"" and look for the PSP, it will show as an external drive or similar.This was the first thing I bought for my PSP, it was easy for me to use, and I can see myself using it a lot."
3,Here is how to use the cable,"A lot of people seem to be complaing that the cable doesn't work. In order for your computer to recognize it, you must first put the PSP in USB Connection mode. This option is selectable from the Home desktop (just search for it). Have that selected and running with the cable connected to your computer and the PSP should pop up as a new drive on your computer.You can go here (http://hardware.gamespot.com/Story-ST-11721-172 5-x-x-x) to learn how to transfer videos. For pics you make a folder in the root called DCIM then another inside that called 101MSDCF then put your pics in, but the have to be named like this :DSC00162.JPG The last 4 numbers can be any numbers you want. Not sure about music since I haven't done that yet, but I'm sure you can find info for that somewhere online."
1,TERRIBLE CHEAP TOY-,"I bought this for my son- thought it would be fun for the car-but WRONG! Cheaply manufactured toy, it came and it looked like something that had been on the clearance shelf for years. Vibrating barely moved, and the sound was warped sounding. It never worked. LUCKILY I opened it BEFORE his birthday to put batteries in and I realized how BAD this game was so I was able to dump it before I was embarrassed in front of him by giving him such a LOSER of a toy for his birthday. ..."
1,Incoherent mish-mash,"This is not a performance of Donizetti's opera. Scenes from the opera (sung in Italian) are interspersed with scenes from Schiller's play (spoken in German). The result is ... well, I don't know what name to give to the result. Petr Weigl has made some pretty good opera films, and some pretty awful ones, but this one takes the cake as the worst trashing of an opera ever committed to film. It doesn't do much for Schiller's play, either. The singing (what there is of it) by Joan Sutherland, Huguette Tourangeau, and Luciano Pavarotti is very good (Weigl obtained a pre-existing sound recording of the complete opera and sliced out the little bits that he needed for his film), but there's not enough of the opera or of the play for any music drama or any other sort of drama to happen. Avoid this DVD and buy the CD set of the opera instead. If you're interested in Schiller's play, just read it."
3,An Infertile Hybrid,"Petr Weigl deserves praise for his bold experiment, a combining of the rhetoric of Schiller with the lyricism of Donizetti to achieve something higher, a Shakespearian heft in the telling of the sad tale of the Scottish queen, Mary Stuart. Unfortunately, the tale as related does not transcend the soap operatic, and this despite the beautiful voices of Sutherland, Tourangeau and Pavarotti. The end result is essentially no more than vintage melodrama. The characters parade past the viewer as if on stilts. The combination of the rhetorical and the lyrical emerges simply as doubly pretentious in the unfriendly (because realistic) medium of film. The director's intention was fascinating. It is too bad that the resultant film is no more than mediocre."
1,And now for something completely different,"The film attempts to combine Schiller's play with Donizetti's opera. The target audience may be opera lovers who grew up in countries where Shiller is taught and revered in highschool. The Czech actors are dubbed in German for the dialogues and in Italian by the Decca recording of the opera, for the sung scenes. The film starts with 15 minutes of an exceedingly tedious dialogue in German. Watching the Czech actors proceed from dubbed spoken German to the dubbed voices of famous singers in Italian is absurd beyond belief. The whole thing has the logic of a Monty Python sketch, and casts some doubt on director Petr Weigl's artistic judgment. The audio and video quality are excellent."
1,Disappointing for Sutherland Fans,"This DVD is of Maria Stuarda is in fact a film, which is a... of Donizetti's opera. Dramatic scenes and arias arechopped and changed around at will, with huge chunks of music missing,suddenly interspersed with German dialogue. This is bad enough; whatis worse is watching ... eastern european actors and actressestrying ... to lip synch to Joan Sutherland's magnificentvoice. The makers of the film didn't even specially record thesoundtrack, they just lifted directly from Sutherland's full recordingof the opera. I would recommend anyone to steer clear of this...."
4,Very nice kit,"Absolutely pleased with this product. I purchased a second one. I use them with SB-800s for hair/key lights on stands for portraiture. I have not tried them on camera yet or at the end of a flash cord in hand but I plan to.It's a very nice kit, the images on this page do not do the product justice. There are colored gels, additional diffuser panels to control output, a large black sided enclosure for directional flash and more.Needs better instructions though, I would have given it 5 stars except for this."
4,Decent book,"Read this every morning with the crew for a season and turned out to have great topics of discussion and helpful information every man could use, some bits may seem contridictory however in the end it is a very useful read."
1,Stoneybrook Diaries?,"The special beginning for this series was ""Everything Changes"", pretty much the same idea as California Diaries' #1, Dawn. This book is a lot about stepfamilies and stuff that Dawn deals with in the CDs. What's up with the next book, Stacey vs. Claudia? Is that like the Dawn/Sunny fight in the CDs? This is so pathetic. The new BSC series is nothing but a lousy second-rate version of California Diaries."
2,Bring back the others!,"Although the new BSC series is good in some ways, and it is good each character isn't outlined in the second chapter I miss the other characters, and the babysitting. Although the other books were a little surreal, I don't like the fact it is only about Kristy and her family."
3,A Surprisingly good new beginning,"I thought that this book was qutie good. I liked the fact that it was just about Kristy and not any of the others, I got so tired of having the whole BSC explained everytime you read a book. I thought that the story was fairly improbable, why would her father call out of the blue. I also thought that there should have been more focus on David Michael, no-one seemed to care about him not being there and his father didn't mention it. The tension in the family was realistic. I like the series and an definately going to buy the next one when it comes out but mostly to see whether or not Ann M Martin can keep it up. My only question is when will they ever be in high school?"
5,A great start off in a new series!,"To begin with, I love this series better than ""The Baby-sitters' Club"". ""Friends Forever"" has a good focus on what teens have to incounter day by day. (As does ""California Diaries"") The BSC series had to big a focus on baby-sitting, as if that was all they ever did. The plots were becoming unrealistic. I got a surprise when I picked up Friends Forever #1 and read it. For one thing, baby-sitting was not mentioned at all. For another you had to interprate what the chariters were like instead of getting a full profile on them like you did in the beginning of every BSC book. ""Friends Forever"" seems better for teens. You see a side of Kristy you've never seen before such as taken a care to her apperence. I'm sure you'll see shocking sides to the other chariters as well. All in all, this series looks promesing, and I'll certainly buy more of the books."
3,Good but Bad,This book is very Realistic and starts off to a great collection of books.These Baby Sitters club books are very good but this one was good at first and got boring after awhile. In the last three chapters it got very boring. I a reader found this book to be amusing for some parts and not for other ones. So I liked this book and i didn't. I would reccomend this book for people who like to be amused at sometimes and bored at others.
4,An honest look at grief,"There is no template for grief, no road map for mourning. Joan Didion puts her wonderful descriptive powers to full use in permitting us to enter her heart and soul following the death of her husband. Her descriptions of emotional events carry all the more impact for the matter of fact statements. I respect her ability to write about her grief, and I would absolutely add this book to any bereavement resource list."
5,Brilliant- The Best American Writer of Our Time,"This is an amazing book. I've always loved Didion, but this may be her best because it is so intensely personal. She manages to take you through her severe grief without asking for pity. Although she describes her magical thinking, her waiting for him to come back, she does it with her usual clarity. I can't imagine that many of us could step back and write about such an experience in this way.This is a writer who will be studied and taught, discovered and rediscovered, for many generations. I'm impressed that she continues to outdo herself."
3,Another Widow,"As a widow myself, I look for books to guide me on this unwanted journey. The Year of Magical Thinking was recommended to me. Joan Didion wrote from the heart. She and her husband were both published authors, well traveled and well connected. Much of her book was about just that so it was hard for me, a commoner, to relate. But I still found some nuggets in there; some pieces of her experience that help me understand mine. I would recommdend it to other widows who are trying to make their way."
4,self help with insight and wisdom,"The book arrived when promised and in good condition. I have only read about 5 chapters so far but it is well written and I look forward to finishing it and feel even though the writer is a wealthy author, she has gone through tragedy as we all have and those who have not I wish that for them as long as possible. I hope to gain some solace in my dilemas and coping and would like to read more from this author and her late husband."
5,The year of Magical Thinking,"I found this book very interesting and inciteful about the thought processes of a newly widowed person. I think it would be wonderful for anyone in this situation (man or woman) to read. I know it helped me understand those friends of mine who have lost partners, and what they are experiencing."
1,Didn't live up to the hype,"This book got so many rave reviews that I expected it to be great. Boy, was I wrong. I actively disliked this book. Didionherself is not an engaging character, and the portrait she paints of her husband isn't particularly endearing. As a couple, and as a family, they just seemed cold. Didion spends too much time talking about the luxury hotels in which they stayed and the trendy restaurants where they ate; she quotes extensively from previous books she and her late husband had written. For what purpose -- to drum up sales? Oh, and she name-drops relentlessly. Yuck, yuck, yuck. Don't waste your time on this one."
3,cool and slightly aloof,I read this book trying to fathom the loss of your closest loved ones. She takes such an aloof and intelluctualized slant that I almost felt sorry for her. She hasn't quite come to grips with her losses and tries to write in an objective way how it is to lose the ones closest to you. I couldn't really understand her point of view and felt at times that she was already detached from those she appeared to love the most. It really doesn't feel real and I didn't understand or feel her sense of loss. Good luck reading this one.
2,An Unmagical Book,"Just because Joan Didion is somewhat famous, doesn't mean she should write or we should read a book about the death of her 71 year old husband with a history of heart disease. The accompanying tragic story of her daughter's illness, made the story more intresting, but not really. The slim volume should have been a magazine article. The author gathered up and reviewed all information available on death and her daughter's illness; pronouncd the death information inadequate and wrote a book. The book is not insightful. Rather, I found it to be self indulgent. It crossed my mind that maybe she had to write the book to pay her daughters medical bills or her own. I rejected that idea and came to the conclusion that she did it to help herself. I think the book is successful because no main stream critic is willing to honestly review the book for fear of being labled insensitive."
3,"""A Certain Look""","I can best express my opinion of this book by referring to the following words found on pages 74-75: ""People who have recently lost someone have a certain look, recognizable maybe only to those who have seen that look on their own faces. I have noticed it on my face and I notice it now on others. The look is one of extreme vulnerability, nakedness, openness. It is the look of someone who walks from the ophthalmologist's office into the bright daylight with dilated eyes, or of someone who wears glasses and is suddenly made to take them off."" On December 30, 2003, Ms. Didion was made to take off her glasses. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending upon one's perspective), this book was written before she was able to once again put on her glasses. If Joan Didion, in all of her brokenness, is what you're looking for you will certainly find that here. However, if you're looking for the fruits of mourning I would look elsewhere as Ms. Didion cannot share what she has yet to possess."
5,Identifiable,"I wanted to read this book because I too, had been psychotic after the death of my spouse. Although our lifestyle was somewhat different than her family life, I was able to identify with her in many ways. I feel that everyone who has lost a spouse should read this book whether or not they think they handled the death well."
1,A less than magical haze,"This was disappointing for me. Maybe it was the style in which it was written; my mind wandered as I read this book and I had to re-read paragraphs and still wasn't able to get into the flow of the book. The perspective is sometimes dreamy, detached, and directionless; sometimes it makes more solid connections. Then back into sentiment, detached wandering thoughts... I wasn't sure where any of it was going. Perhaps a bereaved individual may identify with some events or expressed feelings, but besides validation of common feelings associated with bereavement and grief, it wasn't as sound a ""guide"" as others of this topic. Other reviewers report reading it in one sitting with a box of tissues; the style just didn't have that effect on me whatsoever."
4,"Hits home for me, too","I'm reading this book now. My son died suddenly in January, at the age of 28, so it's still fresh. I thank Ms. Didion for writing this book. I know not everyone can relate to her or this book, but I can, and I appreciate that. You think you know what hell is, but you don't until you've lost a child or a spouse."
4,The Year of Magical Thinking,This was really a great book especially for the person who has lost a loved one or who knows someone who has. I found it easy to read and very inspirational.
4,Obsessive,"Joan Didion's book is quite a statement of the grieving and mourning process from losing her husband, and even more so of what seems to be her near consuming relationship with him during their marriage. Early in the book she states that the loss of a loved one is most difficult for those who depended deeply on that person. So, this book, I think, is best understood when remembering that it is the account of such a relationship. That she would remember or write down such extensive detail, often on a day by day - even hour by hour basis, of all of the events leading up to his death, gives us the clue into what makes her tick, and why she found his loss so particularly stressful. Given that, this book is a tour de force, and definitely worth reading."
4,Especially good for the grieving,"Anyone who is planning on dying some day should read this book.More importantly, anyone who will grieve the loss of a dear one should read this book.Yes, you will have to forgive Didion for being a member of the wealthy, intellectual elite,but her clear and honest voice will allow you to see past her tendancy to name-drop and pine for Paris in the fall.Look, even rich poets grieve.This story is much needed in a culture that tries to rob grief and death of their tender graces and virtues.The Year of Magical Thinking gives this wisdom back to us."
1,I feel sorry for Joan Didion,"Losing your husband and struggling with your daughter's illness at the same time, I am sure, is horrible. I feel for Ms. Didion and I feel bad for criticizing her book. But I must. I did not like it at all. It did absolutely nothing for me. I didn't find it at all Magical. There was way too much name-dropping and place-dropping. For a book about such an emotion-laden experience, I found her voice completely devoid of emotion. Was that the point, I wonder? That you are a zombie after such an experience? Was the book SUPPOSED to be zombie-like? I am still scratching my head wondering what others see in this book."
1,Would not recommend,"I absolutely could not stand this book.A wealthy American women's clinical account about death makes my own loss even more difficult than it has been up to reading this. After a death one needs to find hope (in my case, not a saccharine or cliche hope, but a genuine one) and despite Didion's own losses, there are not enough glimmers of light here.Signed,Journalism-educated hyphenated-American"
2,Don't believe the hype!,"I read this book because it was one of the New York Times ""best ten"" of the year. Didion's elitism put me off. Also I could not feel that her loss was more important than any other writer's, or her grieving more interesting, and certainly not worth the accolades that this book has received. I am intrigued by those reviewers who stridently defend the literary value of this text."
2,You Ain't Dumb,"I loved the review below, it described my thoughts on this book entirely. Amy sweetie, you ain't dumb. You just didn't have the luck and circumstance to get on the generic track that almost guarantees success in this country. Think about it, Joan had the great Berkeley education, the internship at Vogue, all those connections in NY and California. I think for people like Didion, New York and California are the only states of any real consequence in this country. She certainly wouldn't be travelling to any of the other 48 for a vacation. Except, of course if it was to report a story, right Joan."
2,Not destined to be a classic...,"Writing this book may have been cathartic for Joan Didion, but it doesn't offer much to help others who are experiencing grief and loss. This book seemed to come more from her head than her heart. The real pain just didn't make it onto the page. She seemed removed from herself as if she were experiencing the grief at arm's length. I'd like to know the real stuff -- not what she thought but what she felt. That's what really matters when you are grieving."
3,"Thoughtful, but too much personal detail","I just finished reading this book after putting it down for a couple of weeks; unlike another reviewer, I could. Although there were a few poignant moments that reached a deeper place and spoke to the experience of grief and loss, I found most of the book to be too much detail about her over-privileged personal life, both current and historic, which I found largely irrelvant. A book I found much more helpful was A Grace Disguised by Jerry Sittser, despite the underlying message about God. Others have found Final Gifts by Maggie Callanan and Patricia Kelley helpful, but only if you have time to anticipate the death of the ones you've lost."
3,"For some it's cold, for some it's just right","This book is definitely worth reading for several stirring passages about what grief does to Didion. Her style is definitely not for everyone. There are moments of boomeresque naval-gazing which I think is what puts off some of the other reviewers, as well as a layering of sometimes unnecessary detail. (I'm surprised at how many people are offended that other people travel, hobnob and enjoy knowing interesting people.) Perhaps the thing that I most come away with is the humiliation of grief, how it renders us impotent, cold, alone, humbled, unreachable. It affects us least when we feel we are not hearing her voice as much as her assembling grief studies and poetry into artifice. It affects us most when we feel we are hearing her."
3,This is Magical??,"Strange things have happened in my life since my husband died almost two years ago. Several incidents appear to have been manipulated by him for my benefit. And no, I'm not nuts. To my surprise, many of the (perfectly normal) women that I know believe that many dead persons try to contact their loved ones. Living spouses play their part by keeping enough of an open mind to recognize the possibilities.I bought Ms Didion's book hoping that she had experiences similar to mine. I guess the ""magical thinking"" was her hope and expectation that he might return. If you substitute the word ""wishful"" for ""magical"", you've got it."
2,Meh,"I had heard so much about this book and, with the loss of my father, was hoping to understand what my mom was going through, and even my own thoughts. While there were a few tidbits, I came away thinking, ""meh""."
1,Bunch of babble,"I just could not get through this book. It kept jumping all over. I couldn't keep the events and timeline straight. It just felt like it was going nowhere, nothing was really happening. She just kept babbling over and over about the same things. I kept trying to get into it and finally told myself to just let it go and stop forcing myself to read it. I feel a bit harsh saying this, as people all have their ways of dealing with death. But if I am mourning over a death and feel the need to write about it, it will be in my own private journal and I won't claim it to be interesting and charge people to buy and read it."
1,I agree with Book Club Hated it.,This book was just boring. I could barely get through it but made myself so I could try to understand why people liked it. I felt that the author did an awful lot of name dropping. It's really not all it's cracked up to be.
5,Heart Rendering And Inspiring,"This latest tome from one of America's greatest writers is arguably the best of her storied career. Joan Didion bares her soul in this heart wrenching book which delves into the year she lost her husband and dealt with the critical illness of her only child.In reading Didion's book you feel you are in her soul as she experiences every moment of despair, every wistful memory and every particle of hope she clings onto.Though this is a book about dealing with death and illness it is a book about life and hope.Though the book deals with a specific year it offers detailed insight into the past that makes it one of the most compelling autobiographies of all time."
4,I liked this book a lot!,I read this book in about 2 days--that is really quite fast for me. Once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. I wonder if the author is going to write a memoir about the end of her daughter's life--and death?
1,Difficult to read and I stopped reading after 40 pages,"I'm sure that this book has provided comfort to many readers, but I found it to be extremely gloomy and depressing. I started reading this book at a bookstore, not knowing what it was about, only having heard many rave reviews about it. A contemplative memoir about death and loss, it is about the year after the author lost her significant half and how she coped with it.It was so difficult and depressing to read that I stopped after 40 pages. I might pick it up again in the future. This is definitely not a light read and not suitable for people who read books to escape the drudge of daily life."
3,Technically accomplished but lacking,"Didion is a wonderful writer and is able to capture a moment's feeling and a moment's grieving. However, I found that this book did not live up to the stellar reviews. It's clear that she and Dunne had a very good marriage and that she misses him terribly, but beyond that obvious and important point, I found the book too self-indulgent to be memorable.It's almost as if Didion is saying that grief and loss are terrible, but that they're even worse when the one who dies and the one who remains alive are both literary figures who are able to capture their grief in words. Didion also falls occasionally into the trap of name-dropping."
4,A Grief Notebook,"Ms. Didion's writing is powerful. My daughter recently lost her husband in an accident, and she is finding the book helpful and true. I look forward to seeing the play."
2,I'm the 578th review--woo hoo!,"This was a let down for me. Too much name-dropping, too much place-dropping, too much metaphysics and psycho-babble. Plus, she didn't address what I would consider to be one of the most obvious challenges a widow must face: her own mortality. Not one word about her own mortality. Strange. (Also strange: the word 'cry' or 'crying' never appears in the book. Strange)."
2,Repetitive and Pedantic,"Didion repeats unnecessary details. That might be fine when reading the book, but I listened to it on CD, so it was maddening.I thought the book was overrated and the insights were minimal."
2,Not the Best on the Subject,"For more than 40 years I have read books on all aspects of grief, many written through the tears of the writer. Those books moved me, inspired me, and taught me about grief and about love. I wish I could say the same for Ms. Didion's book. Unfortunately, Ms. Didion writes as though reporting on grief from a distance, not as someone conveying the true devastation of this experience. As one currently grieving myself, I am easily moved and touched, and this book failed to do either.Please, look further and buy other books on this subject."
2,Disappointed...,"Like other readers, I couldn't wait to read this book. Well, I'm learning to not always listen to the reviews. Again, I don't want to discredit anyone's feelings or experiences in writing this book, but I struggled with it greatly... I kept thinking, ""when are we going to get to the good stuff."" I was still thinking that at the end. I tried to be brought in by the words, but they kept feeling like I was just reading the entire time."
2,Difficult Read,"Okay... I read a lot of books and I believe myself to be fairly intelligent. This book was so arduous for me to read! I am very much in touch with my emotions, have lost 3 immediate family members already in my 30 years of life on this Earth and I am very open-minded... but I could NOT connect to her writing style so I had a hard time finding the emotion in the story. I actually forced myself to finish approximately 2/3's of this book.. and then I completely stopped reading it and put it back on the shelf. At times I felt like I should be using my dictionary along with the book, too...and that is not a good feeling. I'm not saying it is a horrible read but, in my opinion, many people may be disappointed like I have been with this book."
2,A disappointing read.,"I do not want to sound insensitive to Ms. Didion's grief, but I found this memoir to be a disjointed, hyper-intellectual, rambling. I have had my own personal share of grief, as we ALL will at some point in our journey. And, working as a Hospice nurse, I have been privy to the intimacies of loss and mourning of many others. So, I can emphasize with the author, and yet, I cannot recommend this book. I learned nothing from it, and in fact, cannot even bring myself to finish it. The many references cited show that Ms. Didion did her homework, but the book didn't work for me."
1,What Were the Critics Thinking?,"I don't get it. All the hype over this book, that is. I waited for months to read it and was totally disappointed. To me, this was a disjointed first draft not worthy of final publication, not worth killing so many trees. I've read many books on grief and loss and this was by far the most unmoving of all. I agree with the other critics here who said there was nothing new, that the author seemed too detached, too analytical, scientific, without a sufficient emotional balance to all the dry factual ramblings.This book was a wasted opportunity. I saw no genius at work here. Maybe that's because I could only get half way through the book. I couldn't make it to the end. And I'm a reader. Death, dying, and grief are my favorite subjects. I'm a published author of fiction, too. But I just didn't get it.I wish I did. I really wanted to like it. To love it, even. But that was not possible. Go figure."
3,Hard to read,"Last year was a year in review for me - of grief - and this book was a gift, a recommended read. I would say that this was the hardest book to read, a book on someoneelse's grief.Joan Didion, I was told, is a wonderful writer and this added to the anticipation. But this book is raw, repetative, like a personal journal where one would write just to get the emotions out, but not necessarily a good read for the general public.If one were curious as to what Joan Didion was feeling as she lived her life, grieved, what went through her head in those months before and after the deaths of her loved ones, then this would be relevent.But as a bedtime book to fall asleep with, I would not recommend this.After reading this book, I swore that I would never read another book on grief again."
2,Overrated,"So much has been said and written about this book and Didion's investment in limning the minutiae of ""the painful everyday"" around her husband's death and her daughter's illness that I came to this with high hopes. That said, it's curiously aloof and off-putting. Didion is an arrogant narrator -- name-dropping famous friends, assuming great reader familiarity with the little details of her life and the B-list socialite circles she runs in. She seems highly invested in outlining her copious research on her husband's heart condition and daughter's illness -- which she frames as a coping mechanism, but it comes across as a need to prove something to the audience. It's an awkward read as a result -- coolly clinical even as its imperious and presumptuous. There's no denying she's a good writer, but Didiont treads ground that has been more carefully and more involvingly written about by other people in other places........."
2,A few days of wondering.........,"Yes, a few days of wondering how this book merited The National Book Award. This is the most emotionless, clinical, cold book I have ever read about losing a loved one. While I didn't expect or want, gushing, maudlin sentiment, I expected some sort of revelation from Joan. Alas, there was none. At times, I felt as if I were reading a medical test book.The constant name-dropping was obnoxious and unnecessary.I vow to be more discriminating in my future reading selections and not believe all the hype."
4,the meaning of loss,"I didn't understand the process of grieving and the impact of death until I read The year of Magical Thinking. In this lovely book, Ms. Didion has helped me to understand previously could not be explained to me. How a person can be so integral to you, that to lose them is to lose a part of yourself, and become closer to your own mortality. ""We are imperfect mortal beings, aware of that mortality even as we push it away, failed by our very complication, so wired that when we mourn our losses, we also mourn, for better or for worse, ourselfs. As we were. As we are no longer. As we will one day not be at all.""Like a strong earthquake can change our planet's orbit, grief knocks you off your axis completely. If you have lost someone - or perhaps more especially - if you want to understand what loss means to someone you love, read this book."
2,Oddly devoid of emotion... endless name dropping!,"Perhaps because of her wide respect in the literary world (her talent is undeniable), this Didion work amassed glowing reviews -- (and in this instance) undeservedly. Her trials during ""the year of magical thinking"" were staggering in frequency and severity -- and certainly worthy of a deep, insightful examination of the grieving process. Instead, the reader is subjected to detail upon meaningless detail of fabulous friends, decadent trips, and prototypical life in Malibu. I've no doubt that Ms. Didion's grief over the loss of her soulmate (along with her daugther's illness) was as deep an emotional fracture as any of us could imagine, but she just wasn't successful in taking the reader there. I believe the book helped her heal; but frankly it's a boring read that does not engage or compel."
2,If only Joan Didion were half the writer she thinks she is...,"I tried _Slouching Towards Bethlehem_ and _The White Album_ some 30 years ago, back when I was an English major in college, and an aspiring author myself. Maybe I was in a bad mood when I read them, but my opinion at the time was that they were self-important crap. I decided to give this one a shot after seeing the praise heaped upon it and...no dice. Something about her voice just rubs me the wrong way. And I find annoying her indirect compliments to herself of how good a writer she is (this time, she lets her late husband compliment her). Two stars for competent writing, but the whole thing got tedious long before it had the grace to end. Yet another prize-winning let-down. Back to the used book shop.I'm also mildly amused because this book rang the bell on my own ""Overate-o-meter"": have used copies reached $0.01 on Amazon marketplace? Yep, can't give this thing away..."
4,The title is deceiving,"When I heard about this book and it's title I thought it would somehow help me deal with all the losses in my life over the last 5 years. There have been many losses culminating with the loss of a companion that I shared a life with for 17 years. That final loss has at least physically left my life completely empty and bare. I naively thought this book would produce ""a year of magical ( happy ) thinking"". It did not. What it did do was help me to not feel so alone and isolated. To see my grief as shared and normal. A path at which there would be some change or ending. I just don't know what that change will be but I'm willing to be more open to it.I am willing through reading this book to allow whatever is to happen to happen. To see a possibility and a future that will be most likely different from the past and the memories that I no longer can share with those who are not here. And that is okay. I am willing to go with the tide and see where it takes me."
3,a bit weak & shallow... given the enormity of it all,I think Didon needs more time to truly integrate the experiences... In two more years she will write the full story.
5,Lives up to expectation,It filled my expectations 100%. Written from heart and soul and with total honesty. One of the few books I have come across to describe the punishing effects of grief.
1,Trite,"I have never heard of Joan Didion, but reading her memoir makes me think that I must be the last person on earth who doesn't know her. In her writing, she assumes that everyone knows her. She assumes all of her past life is pertinent to the story. She assumes her greatness will explain the story. Sorry. I didn't get it. Everybody grieves. What is so special about hers? What sets her apart? She never gives her personal story in her narrative, giving us an idea of what she was like, and, especially, why we should like her and be on her side (an important aspect of memoir writing). I hated this book. Glad I bought it at the thrift store."
5,5 stars because ......,"Because it comes from the heart, and who is to judge. I think the thing I take away from this book is that the moments you may least expect become the most treasured moments. I think she describes the grieving process as well as I can imagine it described. She makes this book hard to put down because you really get caught up in the instant that everything changes. You can feel her pain and lonliness. I will for sure tell my husband tonight how loved he is, while I still have the chance .... Thank you"
1,Neither Magical Nor Thoughtful,"I detested this book, in which Didion wallows in her glorious self. It isn't about grief, it's about her boring day-to-day life after the death of her husband. If a lesser known, less well connected writer had attempted to publish this disjointed, selfish, unenlightened, unmitigated rubbish, the rejection would have come with the first no-name editorial assistant's assistant's secretary. I didn't care for C.S. Lewis' ""A Grief Observed"" either, but at least Lewis has the grace to acknowledge his own narcissism."
4,Makes you think,I picked this book off of the library shelf. It took a day to read and is one of those books you will forever think about. The author has led a privileged life and despite that you can still sympathize with her for the sudden loss of her husband in the midst of dealing with near death illness of her adult daughter. They seem to have led shallow lives -- not the giving type of family. There is endless talk of expensive restaurants and celebrity places and name dropping. I could have done without that and just heard her feelings about losing her husband. She really suffered a loss and it makes me glad I'm a Christian and am not faithless. The whole book is a cry for dependency on God first.
1,The Year of Magical Thinking,"How can I review this book when it has not yet been delivered to me? Where IS it, by the way?"
2,"Oh, cry me a river...",I was completely turned off by the name-dropping and snotty tone of this book. Could this woman be any more removed from her feelings?! Self-pity party by a self-centered snob. What's the big deal here? Far better books on grief and mourning abound.
1,Tedious and Self Important,"You have to really be interested in the author's self importance to enjoy this book. It grated on me on almost every page. Despite its subject, I found it unflinchingly cold and also, extremely boring. Maybe it was her point, but it's as though she's writing a academic text on grief and death ~ from quite a distance. Frankly, I could not finish it as I decided life is too short to force myself to finish any book this difficult to get through. The name dropping and ""we were such a wonderful, powerful couple"" gets so tedious I rolled my eyes more than a few times. The medical detail and quotes from other sources on grief do not make it any more interesting, though I hoped it would. I am surprised so many people liked this book. I guess it boiled down to the fact that I did not find the author likeable and couldn't swallow the writing style; so had little interest in what she had to say."
1,do not like!,"I just didn't like this book ... for many reasons. It has no real spark. The parts which do tell of events, aren't exactly what I would consider thought through and complex. It's simple. Plainly put, it's not true to the touch. I don't care for it."
2,"Real Grief, But LOTS of Name-Dropping","I read this book because I too have experienced a sudden death that made me want to think that somehow, the person was still alive. While there is real grief in this book, there's also lots of name-dropping, lavish lifestyles and a real feel of, 'Well I'd like to make myself out to be an everyday woman going through tragedy, but really, I'm not.' Sorry if this stings but oh well. I expected a book about what happened and how it was dealt with and I guess it's in there, but there's also lots of jabs that prove that Didion wants you to know she's just a little better than most of us."
1,The play's (NOT) the thing.,"My review is actually based on seeing the play recently here in DC. I thought it might be interesting to note that it seems one can receive either the play or the book with equally mixed feelings. I would say my theater-going experience was quite in line with ""Where's the Love?"" and ""Flat and Boring's"" comments about the book--Sorry, but all I could think after seeing it was that every event in our lives isn't necessarily worthy of being turned into a play. There was no real message and little entertainment value. I'm sorry for her loss, but watching her go on and on about it was painful. There was no breakthrough moment, no ups and downs to her monologue. My mother died in February, and I thought this play might have been in some way meaningful to me. It just wasn't..."
2,ugh,"Sorry...hated it. I've lost both parents and a brother, so I'm not unfamiliar with the territory. I really tried, honestly. It sounded like something I would love, but I gave up after getting half way through and more interesting books sat beckoning on my table. I'm sorry for her loss and excrutiating pain, but....."
1,Death is the universal leveler,"I am amazed at the reaction to death by people of privilege. Like Leona Helmsley's infamous observation that ""taxes are for the little people"", Joan Didion reflects the same fabulistic sentiment about death. How do they arrive at this peculiar notion? Doesn't it speak ironic volumes that her husband's last thought on this earth was to worry that he might have drunk a blended scotch followed by a single malt?"
2,Not substansive enough for a book,"This book is a journey into Joan Didion's emotional state after she lost her husband. Although it was a sad event indeed, I did not feel that she shared enough substance with her audience to constitute a book. I expected to read more about him, their family and their experiences together in a story leading up to the event and her life thereafter. Instead, I found myself reading '100 ways to say that I am devastated'. As someone else here said, this should've been an essay, not a book."
2,Move on Joan!,"While I admire Ms. Didon for undertaking writing a book about her reaction to her husband's death, I was struck by how much she was affected by her inability to move on. I realize I am in the minority here but having lost my husband of 36 years myself and having many friends in similar situations, we all seemed to cope differently than Ms. Didon. I kept hoping that somewhere in her writing, she would give some inkling of how she came to realize that she must deal with the reality of death, but to me she did not. Surely in her background, she met many people yet didn't seem to connect with them when they perhaps could have comforted her and helped her to focus on her life that lay before her."
3,Not Engaging,"This book has been getting great reviews. It's a memoir about a wife who loses her husband to a heart attack while her daughter is in critical condition in the hospital. I don't mean to sound insensitive since it is a true story, but I did not like this book. There was nothing about the story that made me drawn to the characters. I wanted a sad story or a celebration of life story. I got neither."
3,A lyrical but not particularly insightful contemplation on loss,"It is Didion's prose that makes the book attractive, and not the insights she provides. The phrase in the title ""magical thinking"" -- that personal inner voice that creates illogical needs, interdictions, and omens -- in my view attests to this observation. The vividness of Didion's language most certainly possesses the power to compel one forward reading; I personally, like the majority of reviewers here, had been touched by her depiction of loss. However lacking sufficient substance, latter parts of the essay I felt playing out like a musical fugue: variations on a theme that do not differentiate themselves from each other very much."
4,Unique grief,"As one is who is also recently bereaved, I appreciated (cannot say ""enjoyed"") this book immensely. Didion's ""cool customer"" response to her loss, while disconcerting to some reviewers here, shows me how powerless we are to control our emotions - not the opposite. Were her story filled with accounts of sobbing and hair-tearing and wailing, it might have more closely resembled how certain among us have reacted to similar losses, but her aim was to record her own truth during this year of mourning, which she does with enormous clarity. Rather than cold and heartless, her story was profoundly painful to me. I found myself wanting to take her bony bespectacled frame in my arms to console - even knowing that her only consolation could come from turning back the hands of time.The literary references and medical research Didion cites demonstrate the universality of grief, but the ways in which we deal (or do not deal) with death are unique and personal and ultimately impossible to criticize."
1,"Grief, grief, grief ...","Having lost someone myself, this book was the wrong thing to read. I agree with the author that there is a lack of clarity in her perspective on life. All the book did was to make me feel sorry for the author."
2,too much name dropping,"Although I appreciate her honesty and openness about the grief process she went through, irrelevant details about their wonderful life style, fabulous friends, homes, vacations were plain annoying. I felt like all the great reviews this book got was a favor to her and her husband's memory by the industry/critic friends. I felt cheated by these reviews."
2,disappointing,"I am in the middle of reading this book, and I must say I am quite disappointed. I am a fan of memoirs, but not this one.So I came here to read some reviews and see if I am not getting it or something; afterall, this book is a national best seller, right?I agree with most ppl who gave one or two stars.I might just stop reading this book."
2,Far From the Best Book on Grief,"There are so many magnificent books on the grief experience that it is a shame that this mediocre one is getting so much attention. Ms. Didion used extremely old concepts and references about grief to support what she is saying, showing that her research was severely lacking. She reports on her grief from a distance. A very old book called Widow describes the experience of being a widow in a much more moving, touching manner. This book is cold and I believe is only getting the acolades because Ms. Didion is a famous author. Please, there are better books: buy them!"
2,John's ghost,"My own views on this memoir are quite mixed. While I did find it affecting, as literature goes, it is fiercely under-cooked. Perhaps then, ""raw"" is the best adjective so far applied to it by other reviewers. If you don't like literature served up as sashimi, give it a miss.One disturbing property of the book, which seems not to have drawn much notice, is that Didion's husband does not feature as a physical presence. His ghost manifests nearly always as a spiritual soulmate, an intellectual guide or a travelling companion. Didion's recollection of him is in no way sensual. Surely there is something disconcerting (even dishonest?) about a seemingly heart-felt piece being rendered in this way."
5,Excellent book!,"Joan Didion is able to capture for the reader what a terrible ordeal losing any loved one is, let alone two within a very short time. She deals with the fast death of her husband and the longer, slow death of her daughter. The writing is excellent, the sadness you feel is unbelievably real. What's true is that in all of our lives, what is one way one minute can change ever so quickly the next. Ms. Didion captures this feeling to a tee."
3,A story of the craziness after profound loss,"Anyone who's suffered this magnitude of loss deserves some slack in a critique of their writing style. Here, an affluent person struggles to get back into a comfortable rut, but the writing style is so affected to me that I struggled to read it."
4,Dealing with devastating grief,I need to read a book on loss from time to time. This is one of the best. It is not for everybody because it is written without emotion. All the more one learns how to deal with devastating grief. I gave it 4 stars because of the lack of emotions although I just crave that. I know this is paradoxical.
3,Good study of the grieving process,"I don't mean to be derisive, but the title of this book doesn't jive with the book itself. It's more like ""The Year of Bereaved Thinking.""It's a very well-written memoir that would be a good read for those studying psychology or social work. It's obviously a very sad book, and it does not lend itself towards inspiration. There is no silver lining, she just got through it somehow, bless her.I've not read any of Didion's other works, but I found this one concerned with minutiae and almost academic in tone. The emotion is extremely restrained, and made it feel like there was something missing."
4,Very moving,"Joan Didion never becomes completely unhinged by the sudden death of her husband, and we never see her really break down as she honestly and openly describes her actions and thought processes as she copes with his loss and the severe illness of her only child. Rather, she is unmoored by his absence, as if the biggest feature in the map of her life were suddenly erased and she has problems recognizing how to be in the world. The process is slow and difficult and is by no means contained within this book; the year of magical thinking may well turn into a decade."
2,Had high hopes,"The subject of this book intrigued me. I had high hopes that I would learn from the author as she grieved and healed. I did learn, that was a plus. However, I found the style of writing less than adequate. The repetitive words she used did not work for me at all. I also hated the way she seemed to brag of her status in life and her jet setter lifestyle. I found that I continued to read only to find the small bits of lessons I could glean from the boring words. It was worth reading, but I would not recommend it to anyone I had hoped to. I believe it would actually increase the pain that others might be feeling rather than helping."
1,"So many facts, but not some of the most important","Though this book is bursting with data, there are crucial omissions of fact that seem anything but accidental. The most glaring: 1) Dunne's age. 2) The severity of his health problems and number of procedures he had had over the years. Now, Joan is a great writer and I wish she had not suffered so. I realize too that death can seem sudden, even when someone has been on life support. But everyone seems to be taking her word that her husband's death was, from a medical point of view as well as a personal standpoint, shocking. A reviewer in Slate, Peter Kramer, made the case that Joan's magical thinking began before (decades before) his death, not after. He still thought it was a decent book. I wanted to love it as much as he did, but in the end it just seemed too calculated."
1,Not much help,"Having lost both my mother and husband of thirty years within a 6 month period I was desperately seeking solice when this book was recommended to me. I gained no helpful insight, nothing to ease my grief. I found the author to mention far too many times her own lifestyle and jet setting ways to feel any kind of compassion for her. She'll be fine, I'm still searching."
4,Heartbreaking,"Oddly enough, when I read the excerpt in the New York Times I had the same reaction as some other reviewers here -- how self-indulgent of Joan Didion. After all, how many people are as lucky to have a true partnership and to share so many years with a man they love? But the book moves beyond that level of self-indulgence, into a true and heartfelt examination of grief. Didion's writing has always been a little detached; that's her style and it works for her. Knowing what happens after the book ends -- that her daughter too dies -- makes reading this all the more heartrending. Losing a husband of many years is one thing. Watching a child struggle through such an ordeal, and ultimately lose, is another thing entirely."
4,"Honest, raw, hopeful","Having a child in critical medical condition is enough to send any parent into a tailspin. But couple that with watching your spouse die unexpectedly, and you've got a recipe for a breakdown.No one would have blamed acclaimed writer Joan Didion for falling apart during this nightmare. But instead of closing down and recovering in isolation, Didion chose to write about the event, chronicling the pain, the anguish, and the unwelcome memories that throw her into what she calls ""the vortex.""Her experiences are sprinkled lightly with quotes from Freud and other scientists who studied humans' response to profound loss, lending the work an air of universality.Her book, while touching on the darkest of emotions, is not in the least depressing; it is also not written in a ""Pollyanna"" style. Instead, it offers hope in its honesty, in the way Didion reaches for the light at the end of the tunnel, even when she cannot see it."
2,No Magic for me!,"First time Im passionate enough to write a review! Im an avid reader and usually appreciate a book whether I truly enjoy it or not.I was thoroughly disappointed. I didn't connect with the book at all, no smiles, no sadness, no nothing. The reviews and other info I read about this book before reading had me intrigued. They were much more interesting than the book itself.I wonder if this book was so heavily promoted because of the literary background of the writer and her husband."
2,Left me cold,"While other reviewers found the writing dull or devoid of emotion, I thought the writing was just plain odd and frustrating for a book that was allegedly written ""raw"". I constantly found myself having to re-read a single sentence just to make sense of the convoluted grammar. Maybe that's what ""raw"" means. Though the facts of this story are compelling and heart-breaking, the telling of the story left me cold. I don't think I would recommend this book to anyone."
3,"""Magical"" Thinking, NOT.","I was disappointed with this book. It read like a daily journey following a tragedy...going on and on and on...book was full of copious detail full of many facts and figures. With few exceptions, book is cold and clinical and offered few personal insights into how the author dealt with her grief of the tragic personal loss. And shared little insight into her relationship with her daughter. I kept waiting as I waded through this book for some inspiration, some solace, some insights - yet found few. I appreciated the writing of her relationship with her husband however, there were few ""magical"" moments in this book."
1,"""Understated"" is an overstatement","Didion appears to be telling us everything about her year of grief. But in fact she says the same things-mostly technical details about her husband's death and daughter's illness -over and over, and we come out knowing very little. Her daughter was ""medically stable"" at the end of the book. You may not have known that she couldn't walk [I read about Quintana being in a wheelchair in a magazine piece by someone else]. In a book that's obsessed with medical details, you'd think we'd have a clear sense at the end of just how fully Quintana had recovered. [Sadly, as almost everyone knows, Quintana died this past August.] Some disappointed reviewers have asked if Didion's other work is any good. Yes! It's brilliant! But skip this one."
3,Lost,"The Year of Magical ThinkingI know I'm in the minority but this book was boring! There are way too many grief references, theories and quotes. This book made the reader feel less than and unless you need a grief book this book is not for you. How did all these great reviews come about? We all have lost someone and I feel sorry for her loss, but make it heart felt. I did not feel compassion for her, and that in itself is the tragedy of this long winded high brow book. Sorry but this book does not deserve all the acclaim. Read ""For One More Day"" by Mitch Albom a much better choice."
3,magical writing more like it,"Joan Didion elegantly, eloquently expresses the emotional vertigo that accompanies grief and loss. One of my hero-authors, Ms. Didion writes like no one else. It's as if you are reading a book on tape, her voice is so clear... if that makes sense. Anyway get this book as soon as you possibly can. Reading it also inspired me to read work by her late husband, John Gregory Dunne, who figures prominently in Magical Thinking. Thank you Joan Didion."
1,The Year of Bad Writing,"Boy, was I disappointed by this book.Thankfully, it was a quick read.Between reading about her lunches at Mortons, her frequent flights to Hawaii, the fact that in 1978 ""no one thought twice about flying from SF to LA for dinner"", I was incredibly turned off to Miss Didion as a writer and a person.She might want to know that even in 1978 some people not only didn't think twice about flying commercially to catch dinner, plenty of people didn't even think once about it.After finishing the book, I believe that her daughter Quintana was actually adopted, though that is only alluded to in one sentence.Also, she never informs us about Quintana's death. Last we learn, she's in rehab in NY.I happened to read Calvin Trillin's recent piece in the New Yorker about the loss of his wife, and was genuinely moved by his writing--as opposed to this often pompous memoir by Ms. Didion.Her losses were indeed catastrophic. My heart goes out to her.But this book is a failure."
2,Disappointed,I so anticipated reading this book after reading numerous outstanding reviews. I was so disappointed. I felt after reading this book that the author did not tell me anything I did not know about losing someone and the grief that follows. I have not read any other of her works and this book certainly turned me off from doing so. She commented that this was the first book she wrote that her husband did not preview and if this is so I feel her writing on her own is very poor. I would not recommend this book.
2,I'm Embarrassed...,"...that I can't seem to finish a book this short. But every time I pick up Joan Didion's memoir of her husband's death and daughter's illness, I simply lose interest after a few pages. I expected poetic and heart-wrenching insight; instead Didion gives us statistics, facts and decidedly flat, perfunctory prose. And it's not the rawness of the material with which I'm having difficulty; if anything it's the coldness with which Ms. Didion has approached her subject. Perhaps this objectivity is the only way in which the job could have gotten done. But that's what this slim volume feels like: a job, not a piece of literary purging. Perhaps some time and perspective might have helped. Perhaps the full impact of the book can't be felt until the end. Perhaps I'll get around to finishing it some day."
3,The Year of Magical Thinking,"I had never read Joan Didion before. And this was a tough one for me as I have lost a son. A parent is not supposed to outlive a child. So I could relate to some of the emotions Ms Didion so eloquently expressed. I just found that she is all over the place; perhaps that is the way her particular mind works, or perhaps it was due to the subject, her year after the passing of her husband. But there is hope expressed in this memoir along with the despair and the reluctance to accept death as final. And that alone makes this a worthwhile read."
4,Grief: as Holding Pattern,"""There are no ordinary days""I enjoyed this book for what it was not. It was not about learning to forget but trying to remember. Like only one who has been there, Ms Didion searches for a way to hold on to her loved ones amidst a world that encourages us to move on and, in doing such, requires a cetain sort of ""forgetting"".And so she remembers; random snapshots of everything. A life time of moments are inverted, translated and recaptured as she searches for lost words and worlds. Ms Didion's writing confirms my own experience -that we can never remember long and deep enough to erase the nagging ache that all the king's horses and all the kings men can't reconstruct the lost moments back together again. It must be human nature that leads us into thinking that there is a better chance if you can gather and arrange all the missing pieces."
2,Grief Relief,"Joan Didion writes about her ""Job's Year"" of pain with the same type of pinpoint, almost clinical, clarity of description she has always employed. I think it may be helpful for people who have lost loved ones. I have lost loved ones, but . . . the book didn't work for me. I bought this book at the airport. I'm a big fan of Ms. Didion's stories but here I felt like a therapist, and Joan Didion was sitting on a couch in my office free-associating.I then picked up, oddly enough, the Magical Thinking stories by Augusten Burroughs (published 2004) for the plane ride back after vacation, and this was a sharp, funny collection of stories of the caliber Joan Didion wrote around the time of her Slouching Toward Bethlehem.I hope she brings her wry sense of humor and sharp eye back to the world again. She's very good. Just not very good here."
2,"Amazon reviewers, please stop patronizing those of us who don't love Hallmark OR this book.","How odd that some reviewers would suggest that there is nothing wrong with this book and that those who were disappointed in it have some personal shortcoming. That's really presumptuous. I wasn't looking for sentimentality, a blankie, or a warm bath. I wanted a well-written book. I didn't get one. To make a book good, a writer--even a supremely gifted writer--usually has to do a little more than sit down and write whatever comes to mind. It's the poor writers who put anything on paper and think they're finished. Didion is one of my favorites, but she's become a complacent stylist in the last decade, and the proof is in many of her recent books, not just this one."
1,I agree with Wolf Woman,"I am half way through the book and it is torture, but I am determined to read it to the end. I keep searching for what's right about this book. I agree with one of the viewers (Wolf Woman) it is disjointed and rambling. It was something that should have been a personal diary Joan referred to once in awhile on her own. A private stash of words, if you will. Certainly, not for publication. I would be embarrassed to publish such a mumble-jumble of words. It says nothing to me."
4,Year of Magical Thinking,"I could not figure out if her daughter lived or died. Somehow it was left hanging. Other than that piece, I enjoyed the book and could relate to her angst and despair."
3,Sad and Informational,This book is almost a primer on what we each will go through when we loose our spouse or significant other.
3,Coud not finish the book,"I thought this book was going to be great. I work with the elderly and have had a lot of great friends pass away in the last few years. Her grief was swallowing her up, it was making me feel heavy. I know that not many have gone through the loss that she went through. I just could not finish the book."
3,Magical but Depressing.,"The author does a very good job of portraying her thoughts and feelings about what had to be a horrific time of her life. Having gone through the loss of a spouse at a young age, I can easily relate to her experience. However, do not assume that this is a ""feel good"" book about how to cope with such a major loss. It is a very realistic depiction of what it feels like to lose someone close to you. The author does a good job of letting you know that you are not alone in the thoughts and feelings you experience after you lose someone."
1,Not what I expected,I do feel bad for Joan Didion but I think I expected more of her perspective on life and how it is changed. The book mostly talked about the events of her husband dying and her daughter being sick. It lacked the meat of the story and really only gave an overview. There was little magic that came out in the book
2,Far too rambling,"This was my first experience with Joan Didion's writing, and, sorry to say, will probably be my last. While empathetic with the horrendous tragedies that befall her, to me the book was a total snore. She frequently rambles (this drove me crazy) and I found very little in this book that would be of concrete value to someone going through tough times. Two thumbs down."
4,1st Joan Didion book I've read,"I am impressed that the author doesn't use this book to vent. The language stays concise, condensed, and tight, like poetry. It's a successful rumination on grief, mourning, illness, love, and writing. Recommend."
2,The Book is Mistitled,"As a person who is dying of cancer, I am concerned about my husband's grief when I leave. Since this book was so well-reviewed, I bought it. I read it, and gave it away. One of my friends, who lost her son recently, also read it, and felt that it was mistitled. There is no magical thinking. There is a recitation of the author's almost unedited diary of her year subsequent to the death. It neither helped, nor touched, either of us, and my friend is a highly sensitive and spiritual person. I empathize with Ms. Didion's experience, but hopefully we take away from a book some insights. Neither of us did. I recomment you get it from the library."
2,Interesting topic..not a good read.,"Some good points to consider and a good topic, but in my opinion not a good book for reading. Very redundant! I could not recommend this bookThe topic itself, however, will make for good discussion at my book club."
5,Honest,"The rambling of details, medical jargon...some have criticized her for it. I'm willing to bet these are not people who have faced a medical crisis and as a writer are wired to devour information. To say she showed no emotion is mind boggling to me! It's nothing but emotional and unfortunately these readers failed to benefit from her honesty.It's how she grieved in that moment. It's not a self-help book. It reveals no secrets to the grieving process. It's not the book I would recommend to someone grieving at this particular moment. It's her memoir, her reflection upon that year. Her grief is wrapped up in these ""waves"", they are her momories, they are her emotion. And also, the need to go through all of the medical info is her way of coping, trying to control or understand. It makes perfect sense.I loved it, thought it was a beautiful book."
4,A Way with Words,"When the author writes, ""Grief is a place you don't know till you get there,"" she speaks with wisdom. Her eloquent use of phrases to describe feelings with such accuracy is borne of experience. Some of the other reviewers obviously have not been to the depths of grief or they would recognize how Joan Didion captures and gives voice to many emotions. This book does what many don't: touches the depths without being schmaltzy or preachy."
5,the season of grieving,this book helps you understand your thoughts and confusion of the different seasons of loss and death
2,THe Year of Magical Thinking,Probably would have been good if you lost a spouse recently; otherwise not that great
2,This book lacked emotion.,"I have never read Joan Didion before, but was interested in the topic as I had recently lost two close loved ones. I was unmoved by her writing. She seemed less interested in grieving, her husband and her daughter than herself. It seemed a bit self-masturbatory. I would have like a bit more honesty and emotion. It was a disappointment."
1,She Needs to Wait and Try Again,"Shallow. Phoney. Joan Didion is not ""there yet"". When she does face the enormity of the questions of life and death there will be much more to say. We all eventually have to deal with choosing either bitterness or depth from the experience of losing anyone close. I would not recommend this book."
2,Didion and daughter disconnect,"I couldn't finish the book. I am a mother of 2, and I'm sorry, but if my husband of 14 years died while one of our kids was in a coma in the ICU, I would put the grief on HOLD and focus all my energy on saving my child. I could not believe the lack of attachment that the book showed between Joan and Quintana. She never mentions the pain and suffering Q. must have endured, hooked up to machines, monitors, bedridden, having blood clots in her legs and then lungs, etc...all the author can say is that it took ""3 TIMES"" for Quintana to absorb the fact that Joan's beloved John had died. Yikes. The poor girl was near death, had just recovered from multi-organ system failure, and may have suffered neurological damage. Joan doesn't seem to get it. Why can't this thick daughter of her undertstand that her mom is SICK with grief???I just couldn't go on as a mother."
1,BOOK IS MISSING THE FIRST 25 PAGES!!!!!!,"Ordered the book twice, and both times it arrives missing the first 25 pages. Must be a production error, but I can't believe that they would sell this book without some form of quality control. So disappointed in Amazon."
1,sucks!,A very shallow read. A full description of the restaurants she and her husband use to eat at. Not very magical. More like self absorbed
2,Do not read this book for empathy or comfort,"After my mother died this summer, this book was recommended to me. I am not familiar with Joan Didion (and I won't be in my future readings), but this book was horrible. I feel sorry that her daughter suffered, but I didn't care to read about that. I wanted to read about how she felt about the sudden loss of her husband. I was told she was so ""real"" in her writing. Whoever edited this book liked things unfinished. Very disappointed at the waste of time and money spent on this book."
3,not great,"I sense that if you are not a huge Joan Didion fan, this book is hard to get through as it reads much like a personal diary."
2,They should have used Marian Seldes,"Barbara Caruso is a very minor Broadway actress. A book of this caliber deserves the best. The publisher should have stopped pinching pennies and hired Marian Seldes, a true Broadway star."
3,The Year of Magical Thinking,"Dealing with the death of a loved one is never easy, and I would think, it's reasonable to think they'll come back. Acceptance is not easy. Author Joan Didion's story is the one of the death of her husband of 40 years as well as dealing with her daughter's illness. It's her personal take on marriage, children, and life - things most of us experience - and then the suddenness of it all being abruptly ended and taken away from us. Ms. Didion's dignified account of her personal and private grief is a beautiful one, albeit very sad and life-changing. She recalls their lives together, things they saw and did, their travels, ups and downs, and how within days, tragedy had befallen them, and then again with her daughter's ongoing illness just five months after she got married."
2,Over-hyped,"While I have compassion for the losses Joan Didion has suffered with the passing of her husband and, later, her daughter, I don't think this much-awarded and heavily publicized book lives up to all the hype and press it's garnered.My sense is that the primary reason for all the hooplah is that the book was written by JOAN DIDION about the loss of JOHN GREGORY DUNNE, each a high-profile literary celebrity. Without that fact at the core, would the book have received so much press and all the awards? Not to mention be on the way to becomeing a Broadway play starring Vanessa Redgrave..."
3,Not as good as I expected,"I actually thought Lolly Winston's novel ""Good Grief"" was better written and more touching."
5,great solice,"I was reeling with grief from the recent loss of my Mom when I fetched this book down from my ""to-read"" shelf & began to read it promising myself that I would stop should it become too painful. Instead, I found an amazing articulation of the nature of grief & grieving. Ms. Didion framed my exact thoughts & emotions in her memoir & from this I derived great solice.I am greatly saddened to know that her only child, Quitana, has passed away since the writing of this book. I am profoundly grateful for having had the opportunity to read Ms. Didion's thoughts & my deepest condolences go out to her."
5,Brilliant,"This is one of the most insightful, brilliant books i have ever read. Didion's world was shattered literally overnight. What ensued was a long period of profound disorientation and alienation. Nothing seemed quite real. Nothing made emotional sense.Didion does not expect her reader to relate on a gut level. In fact,she keeps us at arms length, observing her painful progress as if through a window, which I imagine is pretty much the way she felt. How is it that we want to watch? Because the book is as much as anything a tribute--- to her marriage, to her husband, to her daughter, to their remarkable collaboration. The portrait she presents us of this remarkably in love, close-knit, intelligent family is astoundingly beautiful and an inspiration. Reading this book did not help me heal from my own recent losses, but it did help me appreciate the beauty in the relationships I lost, and in the ones that remain."
1,Don't bother.,"...P>Forget this book. Jake is the worst hero I have come across in a long time. He is totally unlikable through most of this book. Lexi is a wimp, doormat, idiot, fool-take your pick. The book starts out with Lexi having a miscarriage. No one, not even the doctor, tells her to get counseling. This entire book is absurd. Forget it. ..."
1,Propaganda or simply apology?,"The title says it all - one would have to be completely in the dark concerning even the very basics of Islam to even consider this book as having anything more than the function of a thinly-veiled apologetic on Islam's behalf.I'm afraid it is simply a work of fictional propaganda. In the opinion of this Masters student in the study of Islam - it is worse than worthless, it is harmful. An interested enquirer would be best suited with examining Robert Spencer or Patrick Sookhdeo."
2,disappointing,"I must have been a complete idiot for buying this book. Actually, if you want a very simplistic and sanitized view of Islam, this is a great book. I mean it. The first chapter or two might serve as a good introduction to the history of Islam. However, my feeling is that a book on any religion should look at both the light and dark aspects honestly, instead of assuming a defensive, hand-waving posture. I am much more interested to read the work of people like Irshad Manji, who are dedicated to this beautiful religion but are willing to discuss the good with the bad."
1,whose the idiot?,"This book was the most unbelievable piece of illogical and erroneous material that I have read. It was obviously written by someone that had a western influence and not a purely muslim or an eastern perspective. I thought the idiot referred to those that knew little about the subject, I didn't realize that it was written by an ""Idiot."" I have studied and read much on the subject of Islam as well as reading hadiths and the Koran and speaking with ""real"" Muslims; their message is much different than this book. I have read several other Idiot guides but in fields that I am not as studied, and so now I question how accuate those are?"
1,False and misleading book,"Author is trying to hide violence and killing in Koran and the live of Muhammed. For better accurate representation of Islam read ""Rober Spencer"" books."
1,Inaccurate and misleading. Author tries to hide the violence and terrorism in Islam!,"According to the Koran and Sira, Muhammed killed many innocents, raped many women after killing their husbands, married 6 years old child, had 9 wives at the same time, promised men of 72 virgins if they kill none muslims."
1,almost perfect...,an intersting account about the nice factes of Islamthat forgets to mention the more murderous and violentaspects of this popular religion. Wishful thinking...but unfortunately I still remember 9/11.
5,Good introduction of islam for non muslims,"This book represents a good survey book on islam for non muslims especially in the west when islam has been misrepresented. as i read the other reviews, the ones that gave it poor marks, it just reminds me of the anti islamic attitude and ignorance of the masses on refusing to learn about other cultures and religions through the words and eyes of those who practice it. the people who gave it a poor review should be ashamed of themselves. this is why there is hate crimes and harassment of innocent muslim americans. this book is a way to end religious bigotry."
2,Really tired of incorrect statements about Christianity,"The author should stick to what he knows. Catholic Christians do not ask a priest to forgive you (it is Christ who forgives us in the Sacrament of Reconciliation). The Passion of Christ does not make God a ""glutton for punishment."" His explains the Holy Trinity as God ""dividing himself up into parts."" Christianity does not believe that humanity is inherently sinful, or that everyone is automatically doomed to Hell.I'll let you tell me about Islam, let someone else do the telling about Christianity, because the author obviously have no idea what he's talking about or simply chooses to gloss over details to the point of making factually incorrect statements."
4,Supplement,"On equality of Men and Women, I think Patrik Carkin did not fully understand the author's point.The author explains that the head covering for women is part of the dress code that by cultural norms falls in the decent category of clothing.Different cultures have different norms relating to dress code for women (and indeed for men). While it may be alright for a woman to publicly bare her breasts in some scandinavian countries, it certainly is not here in the US. In fact it is illegal.Because in our American society, women are required to cover their bossoms in public (with the exception of mardi gras) while men can walk around shirtless if they so wish, does it mean women are opressed in our society?Some will argue so."
3,Better than expected.. not as good as I hoped!,"The author did a great job..and then messed it up!What a great, easy to read and simple book. I bought it to use in teaching, and found the organization, language, and detail excellent.... But for the life of me, I can't figure out why the ""Complete Idiot's Guide to"" people let this be produced as is.It is not a un-biased informative look at Islam; It contains a great deal of political grandstanding in general..and specifically I was disturbed to see that it takes on a rather old school conservative view, and doesn't present varying views on topics... The author wanted to paint the picture that in ALL countries from the USA to Tunisia, Moslems were massively oppressed.A great book for information if you discount the obvious bias in view... quite a lot of the book is an excellent resource.. so hats off to the author... and a ""boo"" to the ""Idiot's guide"" publisher for not 'un-biasing' it and getting a neutral mamber to contribute."
5,Great introduction to Islam (Especially for new Converts),"I find this an excellent guidance/introductory book to gift to new converts to the Faith of Islam. They find it very palatable, easy to understand and follow. I also strongly recommend it for teens being raised in the West. Not at all ""biased"" and definitely not fiction."
4,can be used as a reference book,"Like all of the Idiot's Guides I've read it has the cute drawings, humor, and is fairly easy to read. It contains a wealth of information about Islam throughout history, basic Muslim beliefs, sects in the religion, Islam in world affairs today, Islam in the U.S., etc. While I disagree with a few things that he mentioned in the women in Islam section and feel that he writes from a conservative point of view, overall it's a good book that will give you an idea about what Islam is all about."
5,One the best books on Islam,"Unlike many of the viewers I found this book to be one of the best books written about Islam. It was very easy to read and comprehensive. I am a Caribbean American convert to Islam and I can attest to the equal treatment that Islam accords to women. (Now if you want to talk about the behavior, actions, and interpretation of some Muslims that's another story.) Unfortunately, it seems people will not be satisfied with a book about Islam unless it either fits their preexisting stereotypes of Islam/Muslims or completely trashes the religion."
2,Needlessly polemical,"While this book comes with the recommendationof Qasim Najor (Founding member, Islamic Foundation of North America) the items portrayed as belonging to Islamic belief are needlessly and often foolishly presented as a contradiction to Jewish or Christian beliefs. The author, Yahiya Emerick, should have first read an idiot's` guide to Jewish and Christian beliefs before lining up his theological straw men. It was needlessly polemical as if Islamic beliefs could not make religious sense on their own. Islamism need not be presented so ""apologetically"". I rated it with two points for the clarity of its brief definitions."
1,Pro Islamic propaganda,"Unfortunatly this book is really all you would expect from a recent convert to Islam, and just gives the usual set of excuses for the worldwide problem of Islamic Jihad.As an alternative, try The Politically Incorrect Guide To Islam by Robert Spencer. This is a guy who has had numerous death threats from Muslims, so maybe he's on to something."
3,Bernard Lewis in reverse,The older I get the more I wonder where the hell all the objective information is going. In much the same way Bernard Lewis attacks Islam irrationally this book defends it irrationally all of the bad things that have ever happened because of this religion are completely minimized.Barring that the book does do a good job exploring basic Muslim theological concepts. Most importantly today the book clarifies the break between Sunni Islam and Shiite Islam.Overall-It can be a little messy and it is hopelessly biased in some areas but it is worth a look.
2,more opinion than fact in this book,"To give a balanced and equal report on Traditional Islamic beliefs vs. Radical Extremist Islamic beliefs, I read this book as well as 3 others. Each had their own take on history and facts about Islam. This book was the only one I read that I absolutely could not stand. The author whined about so many things and gave nothing but skewed opinions in most of the chapters. It made me distrust the factual writing that I know was buried under the opinionated garbage in here. I enjoy hearing both sides of the story, and although not Muslim myself, I feel bad for the history and problems Islamic people have faced and are facing but this book had the opposite effect on me. I'm sure that there are much better books out there if you are looking for black and white facts and not biased opinion. I gave this book two stars instead of one because the author did cover most of the major questions about Islam."
2,Conservative,"I found the picture of Islam painted in this book to be a very conservative one, and was disappointed that none of the contemporary debates involving figures such as Amina Wadud were mentioned."
1,Incorrect facts - The writer is the idiot here.,"Well, the ""Complete Idiot"" in the title is ... not the reader. How disappointing that such so-called etymology could make it into print. First, the Spanish for mosquito is mosquito. It means ""little fly"", mosca being ""fly"" and -ito being a diminutive suffix.Mosque first came to English in the late 14th or early 15th century from French mosquée, and the French got it from Italian moschea. The Italians got it from Arabic masgid, which derived from sagada ""to worship"".Interestingly, the Arabic form masgid or masjid was occasionally used in English in the 19th and 20th centuries, and one can find masjid in English language sites on the Web today."
1,Blatantly ignores everything that matters,"This book should be called A Muslim's Guide to defending the indefensible. The most important fact about this religion is that it prescribes the death sentence for anyone choosing to give it up. This is very clearly written into the law and enforced in many parts of the world. This is unquestionably the single most important issue to be faced by people claiming that Islam is compatible with peace, freedom and democracy. The book gives this issue no consideration. Other reviewers have pointed out other important omissions. Subjective and apologetic writing is the prerogative of any FREE human being and there are plenty of equally ridiculous Christian histories, but this publisher claims to push an educational agenda, and this is not good education. It is propaganda."
5,Necessary knowledge,"Absolutely another winner by Br. Emerick!The beautiful writing of his book ""The Life and Work of Muhammad"" led me to go ahead and buy this one without reading it at the library first. I have no regrets. Although I am only part way through it, what I have read so far is a ""come on"" to keep reading. Excellent writing, very understandable and a cohesive unit. The pages just flow. It is a keeper....one you ""must have"" on your bookshelf to go back to again and again. Thank you br. Emerick you did it again."
2,Not the best resource,"I bought this book because I wanted a basic guide to give me an accurate idea of the beliefs of Islam. I am also looking at other Dummies or Complete Idiots Guides to other religions as well to be more sensitive to others around me. Compared to the other guides, this one does give you the basics, but you have to wade through tons of comparisons and statements of the Jewish and Christian faiths which have a lot of assumptions more than facts about these other religions. Non-objective comparisons which tend to annoy rather than enlighten. Still looking for a better understanding without all the self-praise and other-bashing. Will let you know when I find a good resource."
5,Book is ok by me,Just got the book the other day. No problem here. It reads nice and is easy to understand. I didn't think the author was defending the Taliban.
2,looked great while it lasted,"was a pain to put on,then at the end of winter the cheap screws started to rust. now it looks horrible so i'm goning to put the original back on."
5,A great 12 volt mug,I spent a lot of time researching heated commuter mugs. I have a 12 volt power supply at my desk for radios so it connected up fine. This unit had one of the highest temperatures I found. The digital display on the front shows the current temperature and was very helpful. I highly recommend this.
1,Very dissappointed,"I bought these speakers on a whim when I ordered my new laptop. I was taken in by the ""virtual surround sound"" the speakers promised. Well, I've received them, [...]. The sound is distorted at all volumes, has no bass whatsoever, and the surround sound is a scam. The speakers' fabrication looks really cheap. They come with a driver cd with two test programs to observe the surround sound, which were NOT made by HP. In fact they look horrible and amateurish. I repeat, these speakers do NOT reproduce a surround sound system in the slightest. More over, I payed $[...] for these at HP's site. I'm returning them for sure. Shame on HP."
1,TOO MUCH FOR ME!,"Maybe I am too old for all this ""hip hop"" slang stuff. Diamond Drought had so much unnecessary slang that I lost focus on the plot. All it talked about was bling bling and expensive cars. I see where Brandon McCalla was trying to take it, but my advice to you Mr. McCalla is that your book will be read by more than just rapping hip hoppers. For anyone interested in this piece, make sure you're not over 30! For the 30+, be careful about reading this one, you won't understand all the language. Speaking of which, it is full of bad language. I didn't like this one at all."
2,Blinded by Diamonds,"I was told I lack the brain capacity to understand this story. I guess he was correct. This story had no point what so ever. Now it did have a plot towards the end. But all through the book I kept saying no keep reading it will get better. Well needless to say it never did. Considering this is the first part of the saga I feel compelled to say Good Luck with the next ones. For this author to be so arrogant, I would have thought he would have pulled off a better story than this."
4,Social Recipe Book,"Another great ""small"" book from the best canadian advice columnist. More focused on the activity of dating than her other books, ""Dating"" delivers down to earth, up-to-date advice on how to survive as a dating bachelor in today's world. Josey's straight forward, concise and always funny writing style makes this book a very relaxing and instructional bedtime reading."
4,Brotherwood,"Upon opening the pages to Brotherwood I found it an instant page-turner. Solomon Woods known as Brotherwood, takes the reader on a journey that they will want to read more about. The reader will be introduced to a man that appears to be a great father, an asset to his local community, God fearing and a dedicated hard worker. Although he appears to be a Leader in every aspect of his life, the reader will see that there is one area that he is not 100% control of, and that is his mind.This is a great read and I like how the Author uses Biblical scriptures and incorporates a spirital aspect within the story.If you know someone going in the wrong direction - Brotherwood can be their catalyst to make that necessary U-Turn in the right direction."
3,"Naughty, Negative & Nice","Brotherwood is a story about a successful young business man that likes to walk on the wild side every now and then. It is the story of a great single-parent that is spiritually grounded, has strong family support, and is concerned about his community. Nevertheless, he dabbles with drug use and drug sales. He envisons turning his vices into victories for himself and his community but, will Brotherwood take one wild walk too many and experience the detrimental side of risking it all? Full of hip, urban slang, this novel shows how drug users can be seduced or conned into becoming drug dealers even when they are already enjoying some of the finer things in life."
4,intrigueing,"The thing that caught my attention was Solomon was struggling with the same demons that most of us have in one form or another, by whatever name society tends to call them. We seem to think they are hidden, but they are evident in the choices that we make. The author was upfront and honest in his depiction of the character, especially since he indicated it was based upon his own life. This was a bold move, because many readers are now going to watch and follow him for the sake of seeing steadfastness and growth. Go forward and be brave, Brotherwood.A Letter to My Sisters: The Way Out"
3,On the First Day of Christmas....,"At the close of the celebration of Christmas comes Twelfth Night - an evening of ischief and merriment. And it will be Kate Fenster's wedding night...for the duke's youngest daughter must marry the handsome Irishman who climbed into her bed on Christmas Eve...Kate Fenster thought nothing of her blithe vow to marry charming Sean McCarthy so long ago - it was made in just, after all. But now that her ""intended"" has returned, promising to sweep her off her feet, Kate is suddenly unsure if the new, and nearly penniless, Earl of Blarney wants her love - or her dowry.Sean is undaunted by the impossible tasks the lovely Kate sets him to prove his affection. He loves her beyond reason, but he is nobody's fool. His stealthy visit to her bedchamber on Christmas Eve means that she must give him her hand in marriage, though all he can give her is himself - and more joy than her heart can ever hold..."
1,Did not Help my PMR,"I was recently diagnosed with PMR. (Polymyalgia Rheumatica)It took a specialist to diagnose PMR, as my GP missed it.I tried Boswellia, Turmeric, and Devils Claw for a couple of months to ease the symptoms.No Luck.I'm now under my doctors care taking more traditional approach with low doses of Prednisone.I hope to be weened of the corticosteriods and resume the herbal therapy.Looking in to acupuncture, Vitamin B complex, Lemon & Baking soda tonic therapies as well.I'm posting this so others can benefit from my long search for relief of PMR symptoms"
2,didn't really do anything,I read about this. It is to help with pain (back pain) I took it for some time because I know that is what you need to do for it to work but did not feel any better.
1,AVOID these pills,"So I bought Devil's claw root to hope I can get the benefits from the herb, but the only effects I felt were aloofness and memory lapse. I will admit that this is my first experience with devil's claw but it was also my last. I recommend staying away from this herb"
3,A Slow Read,"So just what is Annie Oakley's secret?This book starts off very slowly, too slowly for me; page after page alluding to a secret, page after page never telling the secret. I quit reading the book for a long time, I grew so tired of the dangling carrot.I picked the book back up and finished it and liked the last 2/3 of the book much better than the first 1/3.It is a moving story about the sharp shooter, Annie Oakley neé Moses/Mozee."
1,Terrible... just terrible,"This movie is a mess. The whole ""lost footage"" genre has allowed complete amateurs who know nothing about moviemaking or storytelling to get movies released. Part one of this film is watching a bunch of undistinguishable people at a birthday party in the woods. Complete bore. Part two is watching some guy we don’t care about ranting and raving about a missing girl we don’t care about. Part three is watching something (we never know what) killing these people we don’t care about (we never know how). The camerawork is so messy and blurry that we can’t tell what is happening. I have a 55” LED TV and I could not make out anything during the last 20 minutes of the movie. Bad."
5,I use them because they work!,"Oh, yeah, these things are good - I happen to use this model on a Yamaha Royal Star that just got it's 31st oil change (yes, that's 155,000 miles), and have yet to do more to the engine than regular valve adjustments and a spark-plug replacement at 100,000 miles. Most of the time, the oil I drain is nearly indistinguishable from the new oil I'm putting in - these filters do a heck of a cleaning job."
4,Great product but..,Great product that keep receiving good reviews. I also love the sandpaper like grip which helps immensely when hand tightening or removing. I bought a bunch for my 03 CBR 600RR but unfortunately they do not fit because of my aftermarket headers (Akrapovic Evo Titanium). Luckily I have read that these are almost the same (a little shorter but same thread) as the PL14610 and so can be used on my Honda Civic! (need to check)
3,To early to tell,"Haven't had time to evaluate these with the other products on the market, however price and spec's are good so far."
5,Best Oil Filters out in the market,One of the best oil filters out in the market and one of the best price. I REALLY like the rough texture on the body which makes removing the oil filter by hand even if they are dirty and oily a breeze.I use these oil filters for all my cars and motorcycles. Anything that has a motor and spin-on oil filter I will always use these
3,"No description of what the product is made of, odd","I bought the cream. But when I opened up the box, I was surprised that it didn't come with a description of the ingredients that made up the cream. This made me very suspicious of the quality of the cream. Honestly, I read the other customers' comments, I am highly doubtful as to whether they were written by ""real"" customers like me. They sound like promotional language."
4,"good for 4th grade, but missing some info","There's a lot of great informaiton in here and it's got fun games, puzzles, etc. for my 4th graders. My only complaint is that the answers to some of the questions in the puzzles are not on the pages they give you, so I've had to look at the answer key to get them & then give them to the kids. I don't need 4th graders seraching the internet for the answers."
4,Excellent workout,This was my introduction to the yoga booty ballet experience. I absolutely loved it. You get a great workout.The only thing I would have liked better is if after they were done teaching you the cardio bollywood workout instead of just starting the cooldown & strengthening they actually ran you through the complete dance routine 2 or 3 times. You spend all that time learning the moves and putting them together and when you finally learn them all they stop & go straight to strengthening. The only place I'm gonna do these moves is in my living room while the dvd is on so I felt a little ripped off that they didn't go through the entire routine at the end a few times. Despite that you get an awesome workout.THIS DVD IS DEFINATELY WORTH THE CALORIES BURNED!!!! GREAT PURCHASE!
3,Influenced by Bollywood but not Bollywood,"I love Bollywood workouts and own many. When I got this dvd I was dissapointed. I really don't see this being ""bollywood dance"" I can see where it could be inspired by bollywood like the mudra and such but if you are looking to dance like a bollywood movie, this isn't the dvd.You get your heart rate up fast when they start the dancing because you just right into it learning the moves as you go but then once you learn the last move you don't go through the dance all the way it just cuts to the strengthening section. The cardio could have lasted longer, a lot longer.If your looking for a dance dvd where you don't learn any real moves just are told when to raise your hands stomp your feet and spin this is for you.If you don't like cheesy faces and overdramatics avoid it because the blonde girl on the right will annoy you to insanity!"
1,blah,"a bored boring irish gay dude gives an intermediate level swing lesson.the teacher has a lame way of explaining moves so even the most simple step is confusing. he typically does everything in combinations of several moves at once. if youre an ""absoulte beginner"" or even a beginner you will find this cd confusing.the music is attrocious. the teacher is so bored his lack of enthusiasm is infectious. these dancers do not seem like swingers, swing cats or even swing dancers. they come off as professionally trained ballroom dancers that are used to teaching at a senior citizens facility.If you really want to learn East Coast Swing. I recommend videos by Frankie Manning. He's one of the originators of the style. You can peek him performing in the movie Hellzapoppin - considered one of the greatest swing dancing performances ever filmed. Plus his videos are available on VHS for l-10$ right now. CHEAP"
3,Slow mover yet intricate detail,"Not your typical action-packed western. However, reader will be intrigued by Edson's intricate historic detailing. Anyone with an interest in weaponry of that timeperiod will also certainly appreciate Mr. Edson's research and descriptions."
5,Your PDA's best friend!!,I have a Palm m130 and quickly ran out of storage space. I expanded the memory with the Simpletech Multimedia card and now I have room to spare!! I also use Simpletech compactflash cards for my digital camera and they work great with those devices as well.
1,So this thing sucks!,This thing is horrible....not flexible and left my bf in some pain. This is NOT worth the money.....I wouldn't recommend it if they were giving them out free. DO NOT BUY THIS ...you will regret it!
2,Looks Good on Paper,"Well I read some other reviews before I bought this thing, and I think it probably depends on your physical proportions a lot. It was a MAJOR inconvenience to try to put on for me. You have to be completely limp, AND your balls have to be totally relaxed (I.e. your core temp has to be very high.). I wound up sitting in the bath for like 20 minutes trying to get relaxed, then bam! grab the lube and try to get this thing on before getting hard again. Once on it was OK, but it wasn't anything special. I couldn't even notice the tongue thing.Taking it off is even worse, because it tends to keep you erect (at least it does it's job!). Just overall not worth the trouble. If it was really stretchy it would be much better, and probably do a better job, too.On top of all that, it's not exactly cheap. I can't see myself ever using it again, so $30 or so down the drain. So 2 stars - it's as described, but it just doesn't work like it's supposed to, for me anyway."
1,Tantrums,Very disappointing. Too small to be installed. If I had ever gotten it on I am doubtful I could have removed it without something sharp and the thought of that is not particularly exciting. Probably OK if one is very small.
1,Too Small,"The concept of this toy is good, but getting it on is another story. I am thinking of cutting it so I can slip it on but I will probably ruin it if I do. But I can't get it on otherwise. So if you buy this product, get one that has a bigger hole to fit it on."
1,Worthless,I'm MCSD qualified but I found this book totally incomprensible. I went up to chapter 6 before giving up in disgust and sending the book back to the shop. Absolutely NONE of the code works. There are no explanations on how to set anything up. The books makes numerous references to code and material on the web site that isn't there at all. Even the accompanying web site comes up with errors.
1,The Code and the Sample Site do NOT work - A USELESS BOOK,"I bought the book and followed the instructions in the book, unfortunately, like others said that the code does not work. I tried the url listed in the book, but what I got is the error message! The book ""Building e-Commerce Sites with the .NET Framework by Jason Bentrum (Author), James Whatley (Author)"" is useless."
4,Very Beneficial,"Ouch! The previous review was tough. My experience is a little different. As a Technical Lead it's my job to get a jump start on the .Net technologies and this book is a good example of a working browser-based application. Is it terrifically written? Not really. Are some examples hard to understand? Yes. That being said, I now have spent 2 weeks with the book, and after studying hard and working with the examples, I feel comfortable that I could write a complete browser-based application in C#. That is what I expected from this book. Now, this book is not for beginners so be forewarned. Buy some simpler ""Teach Me"" books first and get acquainted with C# and ASP.net and then buy this book to get your hands dirty with a real application."
5,Satisfied,The book shipped on time and was clean and of good quality. I would definitely purchase from this vendor again.
1,Misleading,"Some parts of this book are quite good. The general problem solving strategies laid out in chapters 1 through 4 are effective and simple. However, the authors appear to display a lack of understanding of statistical inference and its limitations which can easily result in mistaken decisions by the unwary. There is a significant difference between the concept of P as the probability of getting particular data given that the null hypothesis is true, and the concept of the probability that the null hypothesis is true given that you have got the data, which these authors confuse. I bought this book and wish I hadn't wasted my money."
4,Not bad!,"Nice guide, grouping by color helpful for identification. Could use more detailed anatomical descriptions and photos are a bit small."
1,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed in this comforter. I have only had it on my bed for a month and already it has feathers poking out all over, and I haven't even had to clean it yet!! Definately NOT worth the investment!!"
3,good,"The feathers get out of it so easily, and it is black, so you can see a lot of white spots everywhere. If you don't mind that, get it, if you do mind that, get another one. Feels really good and comfortable, and it is very warm."
2,Nice At First...,I really liked this when it arrived. Very soft and warm and the color was perfect. But after about 4 months the stitching started coming out. I don't lay on it and I have never washed it so I guess you get what you pay for.
2,A little thin but will do,"It is very pretty, but needs more bulk. Also we see quite a few feathers come out from the comforter. But the price was cheap. You get what you pay for. It's okay for spring or early fall, but don't expect heavy duty warmth from it."
3,"Good for the price, but...","The good stuff:nice color (Olive) and the shams are nice sized (I bought the king size)Somewhat light-weight makes for a nice summer comforterFor the price I think a decent buy definitelyThe not so good stuff:I bought the king for my queen size bed and while it is a little longer on the sides I don't htink it would have fit a king sized bed all that great.It's LOUD! No, really, it 'crinkles' alot when I roll over. Maybe in time it will settle better, but it is annoying at this point.The feathers poke at the fabric alot, but not that big of a deal.Again, for the price ($35) I think it is a good deal but I don't imagine it will have that long of a life in my bedroom. Just a seasonal comforter - it doesn't appear that it will hold up all that well if washed."
1,Molts Worse Than the Birds it is Stuffed With,"When I first unpacked it, I thought it looked like a very nice comforter, especially considering what I paid for it. I soon realized that looks aren't everything. A day hasn't gone by where I haven't had to dispose 8 or more feathers. At this rate, it is going to be nothing more than an empty shell. Even at $35, I feel I paid too much for this. I would avoid buying this unless you are needing some feathers for a Donald Duck costume you are working on, but this would even fail at that as there are about half a dozen different kinds/colors of feathers inside thing. Only 15% of its' content is actual down."
2,Spend a little more on something else,"Blanket is not comfy, very thin and stiff. Ordered a King for a Queen sized bed and it just barely fits."
3,JUST OKAY!,"Purchased the chocolate comforter set, because I had purcahse the camel color last year and loved it but my dog had another idea for it so I had to purchase another. The chocolate one is as warm as the other but it makes a crinkly sound when moved. I'm not sure if there is plastic in it, but the sound is quite annoying. Maybe its water proof."
3,Light and Warm but....,"I love the color, I bought the chocolate brown.It's light and keeps you warm. It's not bulky and heavy at all.My cat got sick on it, and dry cleaning is expensive, so I figured I would try machine washing it, It came out fine, I even put it in the dryer.The feathers didn't move and the color stayed. I just washed it on the gentle cycle. So that saved me money and the comforter still looks brand new, ( no fading ).The only thing I don't like about the comforter is, it has a plastic feel inside, not sure what it is, but when you handle it or move around in it, it makes a ""crunchy sound"" {hard to explain the sound}.Hey the cats like it...LOLIt does get annoying, it's kind like when you crumble up a paper bag.Anyway. overall its a nice comforter if you can deal with the crumbling sound.I don't think I would buy another one.I guess you get what you pay for...."
1,Just like the 19th century,"In case you missed it (as I did) this comforter is stuffed with feathers. Not down. Not batting---FEATHERS. The kind that have sharp quills that poke through the fabric and scratch your skin. The kind that make noise when you turn over. This bedding couldn't be more crackly if they stuffed it with corn chips, and you won't want it anywhere near your skin unless you're wearing Kevlar pajamas.So unless your mattress is stuffed with straw and you drive a covered wagon to work, give this one a pass."
2,Feather nightmare,"At first, this product looks pretty good.After a couple of days, this comforter starter to drop feathers from both sides. It was very uncomfortable because these feathers would stick to the pillows and sheets.Don't buy it."
2,Color,"I thought the color of this blanket would be much brighter than it actually is, and I am disappointed with how it turned out."
1,awful,"awful as others are saying, it's a very nice set but the comforter is too cheap and the feathers poke through. it's a PITA because they are all over the floor and it looks awful with feathers on it, let alone sleeping with bird feathers. right back to amazon it goes...not even worth the 60$ for the set"
1,Worst comforter ever!!!,If you like having 10 thousand feathers everywhere; all the time - then buy this comforter. The feathers leak out of the fabric like water through a sieve. If I thought it would do any good; I'd return it and demand my money back. If I could submit this review w/ no stars... I would.
2,Feathers coming out everywhere!,"I bought a king comforter for only $40, despite all the reviews about the feather issue. Well you get what you paid for - the feathers are EVERYWHERE in my house because of this comforter. Every time I wash it, I spend 30-45 minutes pulling feathers out that are protruding through (meaning a trip outside to pull the feathers out). You cannot sit comfortable on top of it cause of the feather poking issue (this was an issue straight out of the package). I've washed it 11 times now and can't believe how many feathers are still coming out. Otherwise, the microsuede is really nice, it's just the feather issue is too much for me to handle (and I own several down blankets - this is the only one with this bad of an issue)."
1,Beautiful but poor quality,"This comforter is really pretty, but it sheds and while you are trying to sleep the end of the feathers come out and stab you all night! Everyday I had to pick fethers up all over my bedroom and all over the comforter."
1,Thin and Crunchy,"I am very upset about this product it is very thin which you would think it would be thick, and it crunch's like it is full of plastic. But the color is really good. the size is excellent."
4,NIce,"I bought this as a deal of the day special for $39. For that price, it's OK, but I would never pay full price. The pillow shams are too small, and the king size is too small for my king size matress. I can use it as an individual comforter, but then I'll have to dry clean (preferred) or launder it more frequently. The cover does not come off the feather/down insides - it's one piece. That makes it a pain in my posterior.The cover is very soft, and the chocolate color beautiful. It is nice and warm and very comfy. It is quite lovely to look at and touch. For that, plus the cheap price, I'll give it barely 4 stars. For the undersize and launder problem, i should give it no more than 3 stars."
3,Shockingly good comforter for the price.,A nice Comforter for the price. Static electricity is driving me crazy. Tried washing but still lighting up the night. Still very warm and very comfortable the microsuede is very soft I use it to wrap myself up on the sofa.
4,Nice Comforter,"I paid $34.99 for this Microsuede Down Comforter Set. I was thinking I was getting a sheet, comforter, and pillow cases because of the ""set"" but this set does not include the sheet. I've been using this for about 2-3 weeks and it works well. I tend to get a little hot with this comforter but my girl friend loves it! It's really comfortable, soft, and has no weird odor coming from it. Additionally, you can machine wash this comforter but it is recommended that you dry clean it. One really annoying thing about this comforter is how the down stuffing all ends up at the bottom or sides of the comforter. You contently have to shake the comforter to get a nice distribution of the stuffing throughout. The reason this happens is because the squares/pattern on the comforter doesn't completely enclose the down stuffing. So the sides of the squares are open allowing the stuffing to move to the sides and end of the comforter."
3,Light Weight And Comfortable is True But.....,"The comforter is light weight and comfortable. It works better on a bed that you will not use much. THE FEATHERS ALL OVER MY BED AND ALL OVER MY FLOOR ARE DRIVING ME NUTS!! I hAve had down in the past and this one makes me want to give up the soft feel and comfort. Sometimes you get what your pay for. If someone has had the more expensive down comforters, please let me know if the feathers come out like this does. I could give it 4 for comfort but the other ratings fell to tell me the whole truth. Think twice unless this comforter is for looks. If you have a queen bed that is the deep 16"" or more, you best look for King size. The comforter runs shorter."
4,Good stuff,"i got this at an amazing price so i really can't complain. it's light, but provides amazing warmth and comfort. my only discomfort is that the feathers come out from the comforter so getting a duvet cover would be a good idea."
2,Not a great comforter,After a week of use feathers began to poke out of the suede like there is no tomorrow. They pinch you. I would not recommend buying this comforter.
3,did my blanket give birth to a chicken over night?,I love this blanket! Its very warm and very soft except when the feathers stab me. The feathers fall out very easily and they hurt when they poke you. It makes a huge mess in the washermachine and i have to clean it out every time. Other than the mass amount of feathers i do really like the blanket..
4,Love This Comforter!,"I received this comforter about a month ago, and I love it! It's very plush, and easy to wash while looking fantastic in my room. The only thing I dislike is that when It came in the mail and I opened it I realized the pillow cases are HUGE. Looks like they're made for a body pillow as opposed to regular sized head pillows. Oh well though, I just folded the extra fabric inside with the pillow and they're still very comfortable to lay on."
1,"Disappointed, Not as advertised","This Microsuede Feather King Comforter Set did not fit a king bed. It was far too small. In addition, the comforter makes an odd sound as it moves, a rustling noise that sounds like very cheap quality. I was giving this as a gift and now am beyond the return date because it was just given back to me.I was very disappointed in both the quality, as well as the description. This was definitely not as advertised. I would give 0 stars, if possible."
2,you get what you pay for,"product is nice to look at, but that's the only good part. When you move it, it sounds like there's plastic in the inside layers. Also, little feathers are constantly poking through and falling out of it."
2,comforter,The comforter would be all right if the feathers wouldn't be poking through the material. Everyday I pull out 6 to ten feathers that are sticking out of this comforter.
1,"""Comfort"" Does Not Apply","We use this thing for our guest bed and in limiting the stay of guests I suppose it does a good job. However, as a cover for a bed and while asleep it fails spectacularly.The first thing you notice with this product is the sound. It ""crinkles"" and sounds cheap. The sound is akin to cellophane and not at all pleasant. Then you notice the big fault: it won't stay stuffed. From the time we first received it to now this comforter must have lost 50% of the feathers. They are everywhere. It makes the product look dirty when it sits on the bed and it pokes and prods all night when in use.I would not buy this again and would indeed refuse it should someone offer it to me free of charge. Avoid at all costs unless you like a ""loose feather"" decor and the feel of amateur acupuncture."
2,FEATHERS,"I guess I don't have to say too much about this comforter set, everywhere is feather, keep poking my arms, legs, it's so annoying. Sometimes I get up and find feathers that stuck my t-shirt or short."
1,BOOOO!!!!,"This comforter is horrible! All of the feathers fall out and poke you everywhere! DONT buy this! Trust me, spend a little more and get down feathers! These are the regular feathers and they poke out everywhere. Unless you buy a duvet cover that is like 4 inches thick, don't buy this!"
2,feathers everywhere,"This is a nice comforter if its not going to be used,nice for spare room. The feathers have a tendency to poke through the material and poke you if you lay on it just right.I've had mine for about 3 weeks and it has lost hundreds of its feathers,don't be fooled into thinking you are getting a great buy because it was marked down from $110.00 to $40.00,because its not worth the $40.00 I gave for it."
2,"Nice looking, but feathers poke through and poke me","I got a King size, and it looks fantastic. But watch out after you wash it. The feathers are constantly coming out and poking me. It's annoying. I wouldn't recommend. And it's too bad, since it looks so great."
1,Horrible Horrible Horrible,Like I said horrible. Cheap microsuede material and stitching. Down feathers poke through the microsuede and poke you in your sleep. Very painful and uncomfortable. Also the comforter just barely covers a queen sized bed. Wished I had never bought this item to begin with. Had to buy a completely different comforter.
3,Very nice but staticy!!,"I bought this as part of Amazon's deal of the day program so I really wasn't in the market for one. It is a great color and of great finish. However it is full of static. I decieded to wash it and get rid of that static but beware. When it hits the dryer the worst smell I ever smelled came out of the dryer. I actually thought my sewer pipes were clogged, awful, awful smell. I will still use the quilt but never wash it in my machine again."
1,it sucks,The feathers in the blanket are always coming out all over. and at night you cant cuddle up in the blanket because the feathers are always stabbing you.
1,Feather Poke Nightmare,"What a bad product! Is this stuffed with chicken feathers? This is DEFINITELY only a comforter to put on an unused bed in your guest room. After a very short amount of time feathers began to poke out everywhere and it took on a crunchy feel due to the feather spines inside. I am very disappointed with this set because it's really pretty. In case you're wondering if careless laundering led to the problem, the answer is no, since I quit using it even before it needed to be cleaned for the first time. Don't buy this comforter set."
4,feelgood microsuede,"looks as true and nice as pic, no apparent flaws. have not washed it yet, but it does the job and reasonably priced!"
2,Buyer Beware!,"Unfortunately, in this item, you really don't get what you paid for. Just about every single feather that was sewn into the comforter has managed to slip out. My bedroom, at times, looks like a chicken coop! Every time you look at the comforter, all you see is little white feathers sticking out. No matter how long you spend plucking the feathers out of the comforter, there are always more. And they hurt, too! It's not the fluffy side of the feather which sticks through, it's the needle-sharp quill that always does! Manufacturer should have done a better job ensuring that their feather product stayed inside of the comforter."
2,Comforter not really comfortable,It leaves a lot to be wished for. Not the greatest comforter I have ever owned.
1,microsuede feather king comforter set chocolate,"I PURCHASED THIS ITEM AS A WEDDING GIFT ASSURED THAT SINCE I BOUGHT IT FROM AMAZON THE PARTY I GAVE I TO WOULD NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS. NEVERTHELESS AND UNFORTUNATELY,AFTER THEY USED IT FOR ABOUT 5 DAYS, THE FEATHERS STARTED TO SHED, AND THEY HAD TO BUY A DUVET TO COVER IT, THIS EMBARRASSED ME.I SUGGEST THAT AMAZON CHECK THE MERCHANDISE BEFORE SENDING IT TO THEIR CUSTOMERS.THANK YOUYOLANDA ROVIROSA"
1,Not Good,The one i bought about 2 months ago has barely any feathers left in it. Due to them falling out. On top of that it is a constant battle to keep the feathers cleaned up. The ends of the feathers are always poking me. The next comforter i buy will most certainly not come from this company. The price is cheap. But I got what i paid for. Junk!
2,Looked and felt great for about 2 weeks,The feathers are poking out front and back. Not recommended for every day use. Have replaced it with real down.
4,Comfortable comforter set,"Purchased this for my daughter and my mother. As their birthdays are in summer we'veonly begun to use them. These comforters are soft and warm beyond belief. The colorworks well with the sheet sets I purchased at the same time. I am very pleased withthese comforters and would buy more. The price (as always from Amazon) was extremelyaffordable. The only negative is they are supposed to be dry cleaned, but I plan tospot clean if necessary. However, the dogs are not allowed to sleep on them which wasdisappointing to them."
1,All Over The House......... FEATHERS!!!!!,Feathers Are Every Where.... Do Not Buy ....... Worst Purchase I've Made On Amazon ..... I don't know why it's still selling. This thing should be off the market asap!!! Read the rest of the one star reveiws and take heed.
2,Uncomfortable,"This comforter looks nice when you buy it however, the feathers keep coming out and it sounds ""crunchy"" when you lay on it like there is a plastic bag in the middle of it. Weird but true."
3,Bad smell,Good price and good product with the exception of the smell from the down feather. I guess!!!
3,"Good for the price, but not durable or quality!","The bedspread is soft and warm, but low quality and the feathers constantly penetrate and leak from the thin polyester layers."
3,not as good as it seems,"The comforter is very warm but th feathers keep coming out and that is anoying, other than is ok."
5,great purchase,Looked forever for a brown suede feather down comforter. Finally found it at a great price...free shipping...and came fast!!!
3,feathers escape,"It's very soft, but the feathers make it crinkly and they keep escaping and poking me. I wouldn't buy this again."
3,"Nice, comfortable, warm","This down comforter is great, very comfortable and keeps you warm. Just be careful when you have it dry cleaned because if the person doesn't clean it properly it can be prone to damage."
3,Does not come with a bed skirt,It feels wonderful and it has matching pillow cases but no skirt which is very annoying to me. Otherwise it's ok for the price.
3,Very Average,"This comforter was very average in quality and size was a bit small compared to my other king items. Not impressed but not worth returning, does provide another layer i was looking for a decent price."
4,Microsuede Down/Feather comforter set,Light weight. It feels soft. It would have been helpful for me to know before I purchased it that it required dry cleaning.
4,Plush Comforter Set,"This comforter set is as plush as advertised, and looks wonderful on a bed, complete with pillow cases that nestle the head into dreamland."
1,Pinchy,"I purchased this and was happy the way it looked and the color. But the first time I used it I hated it. It was scratchy, itchy and downright pokey and pinchy. Plus the feathers came out all over where I slept. I returned it."
2,nice when new,"it luck nice at first but after one week the my room is luking like nest wiht feders .I do not like this, is weary cheep . do not buy this !!! your room gona luck like you have a chickien's in it"
1,CHOCOLATE COMFORTER,"THIS COMFORTER WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT I EXPECTED, I HAVE NOW RETURNED IT AWAITING MY CREDIT BACK. THIS ISN'T ANYTHING LIKE I WOULD EVER PURCHASE AGAIN.THANK YOU"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"This is the BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY!! I purchased it for my sons bed after having redone his bedroom. Well, I found it stuffed in his closet the other day and didnt know why? Well he showed me why. It looks fine on the outter side, but when you turn it over, it has feathers poking out EVERYWHERE!! He said ""they poked me all night long!"" Now this is coming fr a 17 yo, who has never cared one way or the other about what his bedding consists of. I went to send it back but it was to late. DO NOT WASTE UR MONEY!!"
5,Red comforter,The comforter is beautiful! It is just what I thought it would be. The delivery was prompt and it was a great bargain. Im very satisfied with my product.
2,"NOT a Comfortable ""Comforter""","This comforter looks nice, but feels cheap. It ""crackles"" when you move and is already losing feathers after just a few short weeks. We used to have a great microsuede down comforter from JC Penney, but they no longer carry it. No one seems to have one that matches the quality. I think I am going to get a regular white down comforter and a pretty duvet for it. This one is just irritating."
4,Microsuede down comforter,There are two reasons I didn't give this product 5/5...it sheds feathers like CRAZY and is dry clean only. Otherwise a nice comfortable lightweight feather comforter.
4,Not a fluffy down comforter - but a nice bedspread.,"This is not a fluffy down comforter, it more like a down bedspread. I purchased the king for a queen size as I want that look. It does have a nice feel to it however, you do get a few feathers which are noticable on the black colored microsuede. I love the feel of the microsuede and will also get some sheets in it. People have commented that it does look very nice I paired it will so high quality white sheets and some black satin pillow shams, yet to use the pillows sham that came with it as I did get King size pillow shams with my set."
3,needs to be bigger,"Wasn't as big as expected but it fit very well on my sons fullsize bed. Other than it not fitting a king size bed, it's absolutely beautiful and very comfortable."
2,Looked nice but puked feathers.,"It's a very nice looking comforter, but the thing can't hold feathers at all. I would wake up at night covered in feathers with a bunch more poking into me from inside the comforter."
2,Feathers EVERY WHERE!,"OMG. We got this for our new king bed and the feathers have not stopped coming out yet - it's been over a month :(When we first got it, it was all ""crinkly"" and made a plastic like crinkling when it moved; then the feathers started breaking up i guess and they are sticking out every where -- we have it in BLACK so this looks pretty bad...Not very snugly or comfy for a comforter either -- more like a sleeping bag feeling."
2,look but dont touch,"What is this thing filled with? Garbage bags? It crinkles like plastic. It's as flat as a pancake. It's uncomfortable. It's not warm. It's got a serious static problem. The feathers poke through the back lining. But it looks good on the bed. So, I fold it down at night and use my old duvet to sleep under."
1,Feathers coming out,At first it was nice... but after a few weeks of use the feather starts poking out like crazy. so disappointed with it..and i had to trash it.
3,mine is BLACK!,"i have had mine for a couple of years. it still looks nice on the bed as long as i vacuum the feathers every morning. not a good thing, Martha!"
1,Terrible product,"BE AWARE: this is not a DOWN comforter, and it is not described as one either. We are talking FULL feathers (with calamus). If they aren't stabbing you on one side, are poking through on the other. Terrible product. Not worth half the price. Buy one and you will regret it."
2,Looks good as long as you don't use it,"Good price. Bad blanket. The blanket has a good look to it. But the actual usability isn't good. The feathers poke out and, when under the covers and moving around, the blanket sounds like sand paper or plastic bags rustling around. It's warm enough but I wonder how long the warm will last with all the feathers coming out.I would suggest this blanket for a guest room that's for show and doesn't get much use."
1,Worst investment EVER,"I was so happy with the initial appearance of this comforter. However, I awoke in the first night to an eruption of feathers. I felt like I was on the set of a horror movie, REVENGE OF THE CHICKEN FEATHERS! It felt like a million needles were sticking me, and it was impossible to clean up. I had to move to a new apartment, and recommend my old apartment to bird lovers only. There is no way that bedroom will ever be feather-free again, there are just too many feathers everywhere. My maid, Rosario, cursed and ran out of the apartment when she saw what had happened. This comforter will ruin your life."
3,Microsuede feather comforter set,"It is very pretty on the bed. However, too many feathers keep coming out of it. They poke out and I have to pull them out."
2,Warm but feathers everywhere,"This is very inexpensive but there is a reason. The feathers started coming out quill first and poking us from the very first night. It is warm though, I think we are just going to find a duvet cover to slip over it. Cant be to disappointed but heads up its pokey and lot of loose feathers"
3,it's a love/hate relationship,"I was lucky enough to get a king size for $25. It is NOT worth anything more than that. I bought it to throw over my ugly couch. It looks great and feels good if you are fully dressed. But after a few hours of being used, feathers started poking out and the tips are sharp. My kids won't relax on the couch unless they are fully clothed because the blanket scratches them. I would NEVER cuddle underneath it!"
1,the comforter is falling apart it also hurts us when we try to sleep with it because of the down coming out of it,this the worse thing we have ever bought the feathers are already coming out of it. we do not wnat other people making the same mistake we did.
2,Disappointing purchase,"Although this item is beautiful when first put on, it has some very big downfalls. It crinkles because of the filler and it sheds feathers all the time. You end up having to vac constantly and make sure to check your cloths in order to ensure you are not walking around with stay feathers on you or in your hair. It was really a shame because I have other microsuede comforters and this one was the perfect color for my room, but I am at the point where I can not use it because of all the feathers."
1,Poking Feathers,"I had two of these for a month. You get what you pay for.The shafts of the majority of the feathers are all bunching in the corners and constantly poking through the materiel, i.e. us.The comforter is very warm for it's weight, seems well made, except that the feather shafts are very hard and really hurt enough to wake me up."
2,Looks good but it doesnt feel good.,"I got it i thought that some reviews were exaggerated ...well i was wrong withing the first night i felt i was getting stabbed by hundred of little feathers and there a plastic sound every time you move the comforter which doesn't help if trying to sleep, worst part its waking up to the Barb (little stick on the feather) sticking trough the comforter, i send back because cleaning the feathers of something one week old was very tedious.."
1,Not Pleased,"I received this after adding it to my wedding list and it looked really nice to begin with.After a couple of weeks however, the white feathers began poking through and scratching my legs when I was in bed. I have shaken it, had it cleaned etc but I always end up with white feathers showing (showing a lot because of the black cover) and eventually coming through the cover completely. It looks awful when this happens and I have bought a cheaper microfiber cotton comforter which I cover with a nice quilt. No more scratches and no more nights where I wake up looking like I've had a fight with a dove in my sleep!"
3,Great looks and fabric but the feathers poke through...,"These really look great but the problem we have with both (we have the red and camel ones) is that the down filling pokes through after a while, making them less valuable to us. They are great to leave on the bed to make a room attractive, just don't sit on or lie in as that will cause the down to come out. They should have sealed and compartmentalized the down filling.3 Stars max."
3,You get what you pay for...,"I have to admit, I was expecting a lot worse! This blanket is worth what you pay for it. Sure, it's filled with feathers and down, sure it's a nice color and very stylish, however, two bad things: it's lightweight and the feathers pop through it. Would I buy it again? -- yes. But know that it is not very heavy and the fabric allows the feathers to come through."
4,"Microsuede Down/Feather King Comforter Set, Chocolate","I was one of the lucky ones to get this king size comforter. It appears to be a little on the thin side, but is very warm. I got this for the dogs and they seem to like it. The pillow shams are only standard instead of king. Very good price too. ! ! ! !"
2,pay for what you get,"It's got a plastic liner which makes crinkly sounds when it moves. And yes, it sheds. And it doesn't really feel as good as you'd expect a microfiber to feel. I went out and bought a different one, paid twice as much, but I'm a lot happier with it."
2,You get what you pay for,"I didn't expect anything amazing. The King Size is the same size as a queen set I ordered at the same time (from a different manufacturer.) This set was thin, barely as thick as a quilt. It makes a crackly noise, too.The color is what I consider a true brick color: deep red. The color was exactly what I wanted, so the shams are very useful. The comforter itself, not so much. I have it folded across the foot of my bed for color rather than function."
1,What a Mess!,"This is a complete mess of a comforter, I got a great deal on the price and yes it does keep you warm but at a price and the price is feathers everywhere. I'm not just saying a couple here and there I'm saying this thing is a feather factory which puts out a handful of feathers daily. If your goal is to make your bedroom look like a chicken coop then you will succeed if you purchase this blanket set. If you trim pine branches outside and go to bed without getting all the sap off you will wake up looking like a bird man! This blanket is currently in a garbage bag stored away in a closet waiting for an emergency of to annoy an unwanted house guest."
1,Poor quality,"I purchased this about 2 months ago. It was very staticky at first, I did end up washing it and drying it according to label directions with no problems. I am really diappointed in the amount of feathers that are constantly working their way out of this comforter, though. At night, the pointy parts of the feathers stick through the sheets and it feels like needles. When I have to take this off to change the sheets, the feathers go everywhere and it seriously looks like a goose exploded in the bedroom. I would not order this again nor recommend to friends or otherwise."
1,When will this thing stop moulting?!?,"This sucker has been moulting feathers since I put it on my son's bed! Also, it crackles when you move it around. Price was cheap, but if I would have known about the feather problem, I still wouldn't have bought it at the reduced price."
1,Gorgeous but GOOSEY!,"I fell in love with the look and feel of this comforter --- until I had to sleep under it. Feathers started coming out from night one. And not the soft side of the feather. The hard, pokey side. I can't stand this. I wish I could return it. Amazon shouldn't sell it. You shouldn't buy it."
2,feathers everywhere!,"feathers are coming out of the comforter and are everywhere...i definately would not have purchased had i known this - i have other down/feather duvets and comforters and have not seen feathers come out like this one, you usually see the odd one or two. it is soft and light and keeps you warm so if you don't mind the feathers everywhere this is a good choice!"
2,Poorly made,"I am seriously disappointed with the workmanship on this comforter. It's been leaking feathers daily through ALL of the seams. While the color is nice and I'm a big fan of microsuede, I would never buy this product again due to how poorly it has been manufactured."
5,Happy Customer,"Just want you to know my nephew was thrilled with his Christmas present. He loves his warm, good looking comforter set.Thanks Amazon."
2,Pukes Feathers!,"This comforter looks great, until you wash it.Once it's washed, it's done for. I used to pay my sister to ""de-feather"" when it comes out the drier because there are feathers poking out everywhere. You don't want a comforter with feathers. You want a down comforter to avoid this.My husband and I have stopped using it because it's so annoying. Feathers are everywhere in my house! I would wake up with feathers in my hair.Do yourself a favor, and get the down one."
3,Nice,This was a fairly nice set although I was expecting more of a down 'fluff' to it. The price was decent.
3,Wish the comfortor had baffles,"Beautiful set but after a little time, all of the feathers in the comfortor will gather at the bottom leaving the top flat as a sheet. If it had seams sewn in a grid pattern it would keep the feathers in their proper place."
3,Good for the price.,"This has been a good comforter, it is light weight, making the bed is easy, it is soft and good looking. The bad. It stunk when I got it so it had to air out for a week before the smell subsided. Those must have been some dirty Chineese birds. It loses feathers like my dogs lose fur. Be ready to deal with feathers poking you and feathers all over your bedroom like the cat ate the canary."
3,Very nice for the price,It is lighweight but very warm. Beautiful rich color and soft. It's certainly not the highest quality I've seen but at this price I can replace it on a whim.
3,Warm but well made?,"I have purchased similar products in the past (microsuede down throws) and expected something similar. Looked good out of the box and had about the expected thickness. After a few days though, I noticed that the feathers were starting to poke through the material on a fairly regular basis.The comforter was warm but with other comforters/throws, I haven't had this issue of feathers frequently coming through the fabric.EDIT: I've had this comforter for about 3 months now and have decided to get rid of it. The feathers are coming out like crazy and they poke you as you sleep. No thanks."
3,Good for the price,"Not a great blanket (kind of loud when you move it, feathers pop out now and then) but warm and exactly as described."
2,Dead channel,I received the product and the left channel was dead. Returned to Amazon for a different model
1,Did not work,"Tried these out because I had some alternator whine. Unfortunately these did not work at all, in fact they only killed my sound quality even more and the whine was still there in full force. They have been removed, working on another solution to my problem."
1,Dont waste your money.,"I bought these because some people gave them good reviews, but in my case they didn't work at all. BEFORE you buy them try this, ground your head unit to the same place your amp is grounded to. On my setup it completely got rid of my alternator wine. (My amp is pushing all of my car speakers.)"
4,"Great GLI, just keep away from the body metal","I got this because the local car audio shop had the exact same thing in stock for 30$ and amazon had it for 20$ cheaper. I plugged it in and almost all my feedback disappeared. However, I did notice that when I moved this GLI around the car while plugged into the RCA cables, the ""whining"" would increase and decrease with proximity to the frame of the car and body metal. I just found a happy place for it where the ""whine"" was completely eliminated and viola! no more feedback"
2,didn't worked as hoped,bought this for an s2000. The first set we installed completely messed with the deck. We are more hopeful that the second pair will resolve the problem
2,Did solve my problem kinda and made it worse at the same time,"I have no clue why but after I installed this the bass is no longer active in my speakers. The buzzing sound was cut in half to where you can almost not hear it but no there is no bass. I bought 2 of these, one for each channel but only installed one or my music would sound like crap. Wish these would of worked for me but at least they were cheap enough that I'm not worried about the loss. There is only one way to install them so it's not like I'm doing anything wrong. O well back to the drawing board!!"
3,Not reliable,"I put two units on my car to transform the signals between the aftermarket head unit and stock amplifier. After 4 years since installation, one of my speaking starting to lose sound from time to time. The RCA jack on the ground loop isolator need to be resoldered. I have to buy another pair to replace them."
1,Save your money,"Please do not buy this product. When I installed it, it took all the bass out of the speakers and the music sounded terrible."
1,Didn't work as advertised,"I picked up the PAC SNI-1 to solve an alternator whine problem, same as the first reviewer. However, this product did not work as advertised for me at all. It failed absolutely miserably. So, maybe you'll have better luck than me (like the first person here), but be forewarned... I wish I'd been."
5,A Must for All Female Athletes,"Books which honestly deal with the pressures and concerns of female athletes are rare, and this one should be required reading for every active woman from twelve to sixty. There is lots of information out there on how to be thin but far less on how to be fit. Otis and Goldingay are among the very few to acknowledge that they are not one and the same. This is not a book about eating disorders - though they are intelligently discussed. Nor is it a book about how to get in shape. It's much more. The authors honestly address medical issues such as amenorrhea and osteoporosis, provide information on nutrition, injuries and maintaining optimal energy for performance. Most important of all, they are medical professionals finally urging athletic women to be as strong as they can be. For anyone who's ever struggled between the twin camps of thin and fit, this book MUST go to the top of the pile."
2,Save your money; buy the comic book!,"This is a strange little book which offers no insight into the way Marconi thought about the technical aspects of radio or about many of the interesting issues associated with the early history of the Marconi Company. There are several photographs of early radio equipment but there is no discussion of what functions the devices have. There are no circuit diagrams. There are many pictures of Marconi and various notables; none of these are of archival value. If the reader wishes to learn more about how Marconi lost his eye, or about his extensive sexual adventures I recommend this book. If however the reader is a serious student of the history of radio I suggest the two volumes by Hugh G.J.Aitken or the History of the Marconi Company are much more valuable and interesting."
4,cookin' with little people,"These are fabulous for giving preschoolers independence in the kitchen. I can simply ask my son to give us two scoops of the yellow, one scoop of the blue, etc. The only reason I wouldn't give them a five is that the vertical handles can sometimes be a bummer when you're working for a level scoop."
4,Good spoons,"I bought these to use in my handmade scented products use (candles, body cream, solid perfume). They're great because they're on a ring and don't get separated. I also find that visually it's easier for me to remember to ""add one yellow"" instead of ""add .25 teaspoon"" type measurements. However, that makes me realize that there are no measurements on the spoons."
1,"uh, hello, atheism is on an unstoppable increase","As prior reviewers have mentioned, McGrath completely ignores demographic data which shows, beyond any doubt, that atheism is on the increase in the U.S. and Western Europe. Just recently a British Poll concluded that only 44% of Britons believe in a god, down from 77% in 1968. That's a huge drop ! In the U.S., the percentage of god-believers has dropped to approximately 75%, younger Americans being less inclined to believe than older Americans.By the way, a stunningly huge percentage of the elite scientists in the U.S. who are members of the National Academy of Sciences lack belief in a god: 93% ! Compare this to 58% in 1914 and 67% in 1934. So even among these top scientists, atheism is on the increase.McGrath's book might be reassuring to those who are fearful of atheists and atheism, but is reassurance that misinforms something we should applaud ? I think not."
3,Some good points about atheism as a rebellion but no intelligent alternatives,"The author makes some good points pertaining to the psychology of atheism-the fact that adolescents use antireligious ideas as a form of rebellion.It is interesting to read, but in the end seems to accept the Christian God as the alternative. This, to me, is unacceptable. Like most of us, we can see where the problems are but offer no true solution to the dilemma of mankind's tribulations and hopes."
2,"Scholarly, Well-Researched, and Boring","First of all, let me confess that I am an atheist and therefore completely disagree with almost every word of this book. So do take that into consideration. (Give me credit for honesty.) Second, I'll have to admit that this book does have a legitimately scholarly tone and the author is no doubt a highly intelligent man. HOWEVER, this is the most boring book I've ever read. Perhaps my opinion is shaped by my own beliefs (or lack of beliefs). But, objectively speaking, it was all I could do to finish reading the book.Instead of this volume, may I recommend ""Atheist Universe"" by David Mills, or Dan Barker's book ""Losing Faith in Faith"". Either of these two books is superior, more logical, more accurate, and ENJOYABLE to read."
4,A good overview with several key insights,"Alister McGrath puts forth a provocative thesis in this book, namely that atheism is in decline. He gives a fairly well documented history of the major streams which fed into the rise of atheism as a cohesive movement. He also illustrates where those streams have validity and what their weak points are. McGrath captures well the anti-intellectual stridency of arguments by Dawkins, Myers and others and he illustrates where such positions must inevitably arise from.However, as others have pointed out, it does not take into account the recent surge in atheist literature. It would be very interesting if McGrath were to republish this book with an updated analysis of present developments in atheist trends. Overall I think this is a good, if slightly dated, contribution to this debate."
2,Lost in the Twilight,"The book critiques the sociopolitical underpinnings of historical arguments for atheism, but doesn't really engage the intellectual foundations of the subject. For example, the author, a reenchanted former atheist, repeatedly asserts that atheism requires faith in the same sense that theism does, but doesn't discuss the epistemological issues involved in believing that a given entity, once it has been defined and its supposed properties are spelled out, doesn't exist: Is there any evidence on which to decide whether there are flying horses, or is it equally a matter of faith to believe they do or do not exist? For a sound discussion of the history of atheism, rather than a wistful polemic arguing for its decline, look at Buckley's At the Origins of Modern Atheism and, from a more oblique perspective, Walker's The Decline of Hell."
1,Blind to reality?,"Author Alistar McGrath proclaims atheism to be on the wane, its heyday having spanned the 200 years between the fall of the Bastille and the fall of the Berlin Wall. However, McGrath uses some rather astounding (and highly questionable) demographics and faullty assumptions. He is seemingly oblivious to the present-day situation and is totally unaware of a large number of organizations (Humanists, Brights, etc). In fact, most recent polls show the catagory of ""non-religious is the fastest growinggroup of all ""religions""."
3,Actually 3 1/2 stars...,"Amnesia is a shopworn platform for romance. It's been done by most every high production writer in the business (by that I mean those who stick with less than 200 pages and put out 2 or more works a year--hacks). Banks manages to handle it well enough. One of the turns of this type of plot is, ""ooooh is she gonna be mad when she gets her memory back!"" But she is not overly mad, and not mad overly long. For that reason--for the fact that the heroine has a much more plausible return to reason once she has weathered a near death experience and loss of memory--I give this 3 and 1/2 stars. And if I didn't have higher expectations for this particuolar writer, I'd be tempted to rate the work a little higher."
2,"Same ole, same ole","One of the ""Million Dollar Men"" series. If you read one of them, then you've read them all. Same plot just changed the names."
5,"A fun read, a great resource!","I bought this book before I even got my dog Sparkler. I wanted a dog really badly and a friend loaned me her copy of this book. I laughed all the way through at the wonderful humor and the author's dog's antics. His name is Joe and he is a very well traveled airdale terrier that has gotten into his share of mischief!I didn't realize how many places you could take your dog in the bay area until I read this. Because of the book I decided to get myself a dog for sure. What fun to explore the area with a furry friend!If it weren't for the author's wonderful sense of humor and wit, I probably would have still bought the book, but I wouldn't have enjoyed the read nearly so much. Four paws to this book. Its a definite must for anyone witha dog in the bay area."
5,Great Galco,i appreciate the quality and good looks of this holster. light weight makes it a comfortable wear all day long. evenly distributes the weight on your belt and holds pistol close-in by side. can easily be conceal carry by wearing loose shirt over it. really great holster.
4,"Tom Anderson""Tom",I have read this book and in my opinion it is well written. I wish there were more books like it. It is very easy to read and I hope the author's write more books. There is enought violence in this world and we need more books like this one. I myself could not stop reading and have read it three times. I believe it is meant for all ages
4,Great book,I think this book was wonderful. It was an easy to understand read that I thoroughly enjoyed. The characters are so realistic and the storyline so intriguing I found it hard to put the book down until I was finished.I highly recommend this book for almost any age.
1,Problems with the unit,"My unit is about to become a very expensive portable drive. After putting about 4 or 5 gigs of music on the machine, many of the songs stopped functioning. Can't fix the problem and can't find any info on it. I won't buy any more RCA stuff either. Their web site and thompson's web site both don't help"
1,No Customer Support Anywhere,Unit functioned and sounded great for the first 4 months. After adding 5G of files the unit stopped functioning and the PC-based repair utility failed to fix the problem. Customer support information is scarce from the 3 or 4 web sites that the RCA site will direct you too. No phone numbers are listed anywhere. My player is dead and will have to be disposed of. I will check out the vendor's web site first before purchase from now on. I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM RCA OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES.
3,"It's OK, but ...","It works fine and sounds fine, but the USB connection is WAY too slow. Perhaps I'm just spoiled by Firewire, but 10 Gigs going through USB 1.1 is so ... annoying.The iPod, which costs just a little more, is far far more elegant and far far faster."
1,Missing pages!,"I was shocked when I got this book and was looking through the pages (by the way, the recipes themselves look good) to find that it was MISSING several pages!!!! I wrote to Amazon but all they did was give me a partial refund! THAT does not help me make the recipes with missing directions! I will look for this book in a bookstore and check it carefully before buying it again."
4,A Great Book to Take the Next Step with PSP8,"This book has a thorough overview of PSP 8. Plus, it takes you step-by-step and in plain English through some advanced features. I have bought two other books on PSP 8 and have used PSP 7 for two years. This book is better than the other two and a keeper!"
4,This Dummy Found It Useful :),"Paint Shop Pro 8 For Dummies by David Kay helped this dummie a good bit :) . Being a ""Newbie"" to Paint Shop Pro 8 I was totally lost. This book starts with the basics such as downloading your pictures to the more complicated such as turning a photo into a painting. It has been a great help to me. The reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I have found it lacking in the one area I purchased it for and that is simple photo editing. Several tools and techniques are not explained in detail and/or not at all. But overall if you are a novice to Paint Shop Pro 8 as I was you will find it more than beneficial."
2,awful,This is without a doubt the worst dummies tutorial I have seen.It will leave you scratching your head due to omitted steps and hard to follow instructions. I didn't give it a 1 because it has SOME useful information (but not much).
1,Paint Shop Pro 8 for Dummies,Very disappointing.I ordered this thinking I would be able to understand PSP. I am member of several tagging sites and wanted to learn to make them myself. I guess I'll have to look for a book now called PSP for retards. This book didn't help me. I guess my next move will be classes at the senior center.It also made me feel a lot stupider than I did before.
3,This tape was a let-down.,Eddie Fadal's daughter narrates this video and the same footage and narration is done over and over. This tape could have been reduced to half of it's lenghth if it hadn't been for the repetition. There were a few video clips I had not seen and they make the purchase of this tape worthwhile to the serious Elvis collector.
3,Three Stars,"Overall, it is a good book; it is well-written and has a moment or two of levity. It lost a bit of its pizazz when trying incidents happened to the lead character, Claire Brown, who is bright and assertive in her professional life but isn't assertive in her personal life."
2,First doll,"I purchased this doll for each of our youngest grand-daughters. They are not only beautiful, but well made and cuddly. I know that they will cherish them as reminders of their own Christenings in 2009."
2,MB not GB,just a reminder this is a 32 MB card NOT a 32 GB card. there is almost no storage space on this card. you can buy a 8GB card for almost the same price.
4,Terrific seller! Item a bit overpriced.,"The seller was terrific and very easy to deal with. Fast shipment. Item is a little pricey, but quality was there."
2,outdated,"Being that this book was published over ten years ago, the possibility of this book being a valuable resource as a guide for musicians and songwriters wanting to break into the Nashville market is very low. The book is outdated and out of touch with today's market. The only real benefit this book gave me was a small amount of insight to chord structure, sequence, and lyric organization, all of which was only breifly discussed. If it is this information you are looking for, there are other books that cover this material in much further depth."
1,Annoying product. Dont bother.,Light and slight. The whole thing is touch screen and uses a pen to touch the screen. Lose the pen and your screwed. Also the light only stays on for a second and if the angle isnt right on the screen you cant see anything.Don't bother!
1,Thumbs down: Impossible to operate in the dark,"Although this clock has many nifty features, it suffersfrom an amazing leap of stupidity: the clock is impossibleto operate in the dark! It has NO mechanical controls.All clock controls are operated by tapping a stylus in theLCD front panel. Like turning off the alarm. But the LCDis impossible to see in the dark! And what if you've lostyour stylus in the dark! What if your spouse just wantsto turn off that annoying alarm that has gone off at thewrong time? Impossible to do in the dark, and impossibleto do if they haven't read the directions."
5,Let's go back to basics,"There are a lot of different kind of toys in the market at this time. Electronic and robotic toys seem to have all the attention of our kids, and I think it's ok, I don't have anything against toys from the future. But let's go back to basics... Toys like yo-yo's that don't require batteries are so much fun, and reminds us that fun shouldn't be so complicated or expensive.Let's teach our children to have fun without complicating their life, and they will definitely live a better uncomplicated life in their future."
2,It's cheap,"Doesn't spin for a long time and cheap material. I thought I was gonna play with it more but this yoyo is so cheap it doesn't work well therefore I don't use it. I should have bought the 20+ dollar one, and so should you. I recommend getting one that cost some dollars more just to have a better quality."
2,Fun but cheap,This is a good yoyo but I do not recommend this for people who want to do tricks on these they are fun if you plan on not doing any tricks. I got one and it broke because I tried to do tricks
1,Jonah,"This yoyo is horrible becuse it does not sleep, otherwise it works compleatly to satisfactin. overall this toy is a money draner!"
1,Bad string,"The string did not even last 2 days. Will NOT buy again. Everything else was fine, but what good is a yo-yo without a string?!"
3,"Good, but...","This yo-yo was almost perfect except for the fact that winding the string up was difficult. The knot around the base of the yo-yo isn't tight enough so I was constantly asked by my sister [8 yrs old] to wind it up because it just kept spinning on her, and even I had trouble winding it without making some random technique work. The string is also extremely long. My sister had to hold it above her head [she's over 4 feet], and I, at 5'2"", had to hold it shoulder length or higher for it not to hit the ground when I tried to show her some old school tricks. Overall, everything else about the yo-yo is good, pretty basic. Hopefully it was just the one we got that didn't have the tight knot..."
2,"Un-usable with poor quality, heavily kinked string","The yo-yo arrived with such a low quality, heavily kinked string that it would not wind cleanly...terrible. I've ordered a set of new strings and it may be fine but I shouldn't have to order new strings to use it the first time."
1,Just doesn't work right,"I've been around yoyos for over 40 years. This one just doesn't work right. I bought it for my son, cut it down to his size per the instructions on the package. When he complained that it didn't work I gave it a try. Yoyos are supposed to go down and up. This one only goes down and spins. No matter how hard you try, it just won't go back up. I guess if you only want to walk the dog, this might be your yoyo."
4,"Teacher model, but otherwise great!","The TI89 Titanium is fantastic all purpose programmable calculator and has proven to be extremely useful in both my daily work and in college courses. The 3D graphing and statistics apps have been great. It is also worth mentioning that this is the most advanced calculator you are allowed to use most standardized tests, such as AP Calculus, AP Statistics, AP Physics, AP Chemistry, PSAT/NMSQT, SAT I, SAT II, and Math IC & IIC exams.I ordered this one direct from Amazon because the other sellers were out of stock. I couldn't figure out why Amazon was charging so much more for the same model#, but when it showed up it was obvious. Turns out Amazon (direct) is selling the teacher model, so be sure to order the TI89 Titanium that is $50 less if you don't want the teacher model."
3,guess I'm spoiled...,"I prefer my TI-nspire CX, but since the university I go to doesn't allow that one in the testing center, I got this. It'll do, but it's not nearly as easy to use as the other one."
5,Bar Method Rocks!,"I love this workout, similar to change your body but there are some different exercises and I think this one is a little longer. Burr is an excellent and pleasant instructor. Can't wait to get the new super sculpting dvds!"
5,Good Workout,Several choices of workouts to choose from. All of them are a great workout; very thorough. I would definitely recommend this to others.
5,Great Workout,"The workouts are wonderful, but the prices listed on Amazon are highway robbery. Do an internet search. You can purchase each dvd for $20 each."
5,Love It!,"The first time I did this workout, I almost cried during thigh work, it is hard! I like Burr as an instructor, she is not annoying at all. I also like that all the women in the video wear long pants and a tank; you can tell they are in good shape but they are not showing off their 6-packs. I noticed an improvement in my posture almost immediately."
1,Unsafe!,"This toy looked like such fun when I bought it for my two Roborovski hamsters. Unfortunately, the first night one of them tried to climb through one of the holes and her pelvis became stuck. I was out at the time, so I don't know how long it was before I found her. She was bleeding, scraped up, and I was bitten in the process of getting her un-stuck. It took her a few weeks to recover completely, and even longer for the fur to grow back in. Unfortunately, as a result of this injury, her sister tried to kill her and the two of them had to be separated permanently."
4,Excellent resource,"We all drinks beverages every day. Yet, surprising as it may seem, there is no single book that focuses on this subject. This book is therefore a very welcome arrival on the food scene. The authors of this book are international experts on their areas. The book is wide in scope, covering the major types of beverages. But at the same time the reader is given enough detail to learn what the topic is all about as well as recent developments. The book is an invaluable aid for those involved in new product development."
1,No Crueler Tyrannies,"The true story of what went on at the Wee Care Nursery School and, for that matter the Amirault case in Massachusetts and other day care hysteria cases, may be found in No Crueler Tyrannies by Dorothy Rabinowitz. Much of Rabinowitz's work is based upon articles she wrote for which she took a Pulitzer.It's too bad Manshel missed a shot at a Pulitzer Prize by toeing the government line, and at the expense of an innocent at that."
4,Nap Time by Lisa Manshel,"This was a sick book! not by the work of the author but by the the subject of the book! this book was about the sick woman named Margaret ""Kelly"" Michaels who abused over 20 kids sexually during her employment at the Wee care Daycare Nursey in maplewood nJ. its a true story! a must read for all mothers consitering leaving their children in the care of others. The one thing i have walked away from this book learning is that my child (7.5 mo) will learn the proper names for her private parts! just incase another sick person like Kelly Michaels is anywhere near my child!"
5,My Mother believed that children could be told what to say .,Thats the point in this story a lot thought that the children where beening told what to say ' even if a child is' it still does not fix the fact that children would not know where to put the jelly not even if one told them where ' and one could not get such things off a T.V. unless mom an dad are letting there children watch such things so that would make them just as bad as the one that is sexual abuseing the child . this book told enough to say to us to check people out don't trust the Adults because they have a piece of paper that is saying here my mined went to school .. BULL ... I think the writier done enough to let us know that people with high grade papers can also harm are children . this is a must read for all Mothers an Dad's that have children in day care . read it an check your childrens day care out don't take peoples word for what they say when it comes to your child .. I thank the Author for this book ...
1,Has no one noticed that the conviction was overturned?,"I can't believe that people are still even looking at this book, the product of the 1980's daycare abuse ""witch hunt.""For those who have given this a 5-star rating, or have passed it on to others to read--shame on you! You need to do a little research before you believe the first thing you read. Michaels' conviction was completely overturned--there was absolutely no evidence of any of the alleged crimes actually taking place.This author ought to be ashamed of herself, as well, for writing such a total pack of lies, and trying to pass it off as truth.I give this one star, since there is no lower rating available..."
1,Is this book still being published - I hope not!,"Having known Kelly in college, I knew she was innocent from the start and told anyone that would listen. I followed the real information of this trial and its aftermath.The author of this book did not seem to be concerned with facts"
1,"Fiction sold as ""true""","This story is based on the case of the child sexual abuse trial of Kelly Michaels, told from the prosecutors point of view. To bring people up to date Kelly's conviction was overturned by the appeals court because, on review, the interviews of the children were so tainted by leading questions that they couldn't be believed. This book is best read as a ""what can go wrong"" when over-zealous prosecutors with tunnel vision decide to create a case against someone. (The author was closely tied to the prosecution.) Kelly Michaels story is not unique, The McMartin and Amirault cases come to mind.The only value this book has, and the only reason to read it, is to see what can go wrong with these cases and to prevent this from happening again."
1,SHAMEFUL RUBBISH,"If you want the true story of the lunacy that went on here (and all across this country), get ""No Crueler Tyrannies"" by Dorothy Rabinowitz.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743228340/104-7063344-4802340?v=glance&n;=283155Note: I've had to rate this one star as Amazon does not provide a zero."
1,The true story??????,"What a bunch of bologna....No mystery why this hastily put together book is not in print any longer....how about the true update, Margaret Kelly Michaels was found NOT GUILTY!!!!! Don't waste your time with the accusation of innocent people when there are real criminals to deal with out there! Good grief! Lisa Manshel should be ashamed of herself."
3,A fascinating book and not just because of its famous author,Winston Churchill wrote this book when he was still in his twenties ; this intrigued me enough to read the book. It is a novel that focuses on the life of Richard Carvel ; a wealthy young man from a prominent Maryland family just before and during the Revoloutionary War. Although sweeter and more sentimental than the modern approach itis still a captivating and exciting story.
4,A terrific 60's erotic time capsule,"Its plot is now a cliche and a staple of late night Cinemax movies.But there was a time when cinema was trying to seriously explore adult themes. And in the 1960's one of the most important of these was ""I,a Woman"".The plot is quite simple. A naive woman, raised in a Christian family decides to break away and explore her sexuality by having sex with as many men as possible. What makes it special is the almost quaint quality the movie projects. And, of course, the presence of a an amazingly beautiful and special actress called Essy Persson. She projects pure sensuality but is able to convey the heartbreak behind living a life of such carefree sexuality. I recommend this movie. Don't expect a lot of sex and nudity (in fact, it will probably carry a soft-R rating today) but it does contain some great acting by Persson and a truly special sense of 1960's sexual freedom."
1,"""Erotic"" - I don't think so!","Perhaps I'm missing the point but I failed to see how this film could be classed as an erotic masterpiece. Firstly it was dubbed which takes the romance out of anything and secondly it was actually quite boring.I hope that the real plot and character development was lost in the translation, I would have much preferred it to have been subtitled.One to avoid I'm afraid. Sorry."
2,Shorelines: Cassical Guitar by Dan Gibson,"Nature sounds and music are difficult arrangements to mix. Although I enjoyed the classical guitar, I thought the sounds of are what are said to be surf and water were overbearing and somewhat annoying."
2,Definitely Not as Good as the First,"The first book was way, way, way, better! Although this book was interesting, after a while, all of the ladies end up in the same situation so it becomes the same story in each of their lives, which was kind of boring. The first book did a better job in differentiating the storyline amongst the characters. Also the ending was really strange, and needs to be re-edited because the Trae & Tasha part is confusing. I was disappointed."
3,THE FIRST ONE WAS BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!,No doubt the writer is a good one however the first book she wrote was better than this book. Not much happened in this book. I read the raw and uncut version. Like the author mentioned there was way to much sex going on in this book. I got tired of reading about all the sex. I wanted something interesting to go on in the book other than sex but nothing really interesting happened until the end of the book. I should have just stopped at the first one!!!!
4,"slow moving, but hott!!!","I loved this book very much. I hated it at first because I thought it was pretty boring and drawn out, but as you get closer to the end, it's a page turner!! I can't wait to read the sequel, thug matrimony. Payback is a mutha is a very good page turner from start to finish."
5,BEST THUG BOOK!,This book is simply awesome! It keeps you hooked. Team Trae & Tasha all day. Love Angel & Kay too! Round of applause! I have purchased every book from Wahida. You wont be dissappointed! Get your copy NOW!
4,"Again Good, But...................","So this was a good book also, and we did need to get Roz (Tash) story. I swear if the don't pick one name for this girl Imma snap but anyways, I like how she had a man down for her and did what he had to do to get her, but again it wasn't realistic. All the relationship moved entirely too fast which means money usally plays a big part. But most of all, the same problem it had in the first book, if you want me to not go out with my girls than you best not think about being gone for two days. How the hell you gone tell my ex not to call (rather I want him to or not) but then put me out yo car when i call a b*&^T back from a text she sent. When he put her out and she kept begging him to come over and please come get her puhleeze (is that how they write it). Then she flip out like that when that boy come up dead, Im just saying keep it real.NOt the best of series but I will say it kept me in it and reading. But again on to the next book."
3,Not As Good As The First Book,This was a good story but at the end I feel the author makes two fatal errors destroying the whole story. Without giving away the plot I will say one of the errors has to do with Trae and Tasha. The other error I can't release or it will ruin the read if you have not read it. I still recommend this if you have read the first one. But I was bothered by the ending. Hopefully the author will some how get a hold of this review and Holla back. Because I still think Wahida Clark has what it takes to get to the top.
5,Veeeeeeerrrrrry good!!!!,"As a person who just got into reading books in this genre, I began reading this book at a public library and immediately borrowed it. If I would have known about this book sooner I would have persuaded more people to support the author by purchasing this book. To be honest I wish she had the time to pen more enticing edge of your seat books!!"
5,Very Entertaining Loved It,"I have a lot of books in my day. But this book and the other 2- Thugs and the women who love them-Every thug need a lady and Thug Matrimony. Those 3 were the best books that I have readi n a long long time. I really could care less where Snake came from after all of this time! I will say that him coming back only mad the book more hype. I am going to say agin that I really really loves all three of the books. Who ever is reading this if you haven't read all 3 of them, I highlu suggest that you do. I can promise you that you will not be disappointed!!!!"
2,The Worst In The Series,It took me a minute to get thru this one. The first one was good and Thug Matrimony was even better. This was focused too much on detail that was irrelevant to the situation at hand. Need to focus more on facts to get the reader's attention.
3,I still don't understand the ending???,"I enjoyed Thugs And The Women Who Love them more than this sequel. I understand this was the raw and uncut version but, there was just too much sex. I enjoyed the relationship of Trae and Roz. Angel dated a pimp. How does the person you love who is a big time pimp just dissappear and there is nothing else said about it?. The first book was more realistic. It really leaves you waiting for the sequel and then when you finish the sequel your like WHAT?. Who shot Trae(why), why snake come back with guns he got beat down by an old prostitute, he needed to be trying to shoot her. overall I gave this book a 3, only because it really didn't pick-up where the 1st book ended. Jaz was found guilty by a jury sentenced to 17 years fed time. You would think the sequel would start there but, it wasn't mentioned until page 11 what exactly happened with the 17 year sentence and from that point on new characters with new storylines took over."
3,Ghetto-Erotica,"I enjoyed the first book so much more, due to the fact that,it had a actual storyline.I'm giving this book 3 stars. 2-due to the fact that the author is a Sista in the Federal System. The last star is for the last 50 pages, which was the story itself.Just didn't do it for me. Maybe next time."
1,What A Let Down,"Wahida first book was definitely one to read. The follow-up was just too low keyed for me. You had more sex scenes than anything, no real story line and I didn't see anything raw about it at all. I expected a lot more from the follow-up and was quite disappointed. I was able to relate to her first book in a lot of ways because I was married to a true thug while he was on the streets as well as locked down so I know that life. This book was a let down for real."
2,i missed something,"i for one really disliked this book to make a long story short the book started to make me sick afther a while, i don't even wanna get into it the book was a worthless read."
5,THE S**T,"THIS BOOK IS SOOO GOOD IT TOOK ME ONLY 6HOURS TO READ IT....I WAS LIKE OH MY GOD I HAVE TO GET THE SECOND PART I RAN OUT TO THE STORE AND GOT PART TWO AND OH MY GOD SHE DID IT AGAIN MAN LADIES WAS TRE NOT THE S**T....I WISHED I HAD A MAN LIKE HIM BUT WITHOUT THE TOUNG RING THAT TURNED ME OFF REAL MEN DONT WEAR THINGS LIKE THAT AND THE OUTFITT WITH THE VEST OH NO....NO I'M NOT HATING JUST STATING THE FACTS....MAN THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ I'M SO LOOKING FOWARD TO THE 3RD ONE....DANG I NEED A TRE IN MY LIFE BUT WITH OUT THE RING OKAY. AND YOU MUST READ (TRUE TO THE GAME, HUSTLERS WIFE,DUTCH,B-MORE CAREFULE AND IF ANBODY GOT ANY GOOD BOOKS FOR ME TO READ LET ME KNOW."
2,good book bad editing,This book is hot but there were so many typos and grammatical errors I had to put it down about ten times. Who edited it Steve Wonder? Wahida you're the bomb and I loved both your books but find a new Publisher cause the editing stinks. I would have given you five stars if it wasn't for the editing.
3,Not as good as the first one,"This book was good, but it wasn't as good as Thugs and the Women Who Love Them. There is also as lot of corny things in this book. Like when Trae and Tasha make the bet about who can make who cum first, that was really ridiculous and stupid as hell. There are a lot of different times in the book where the characters Trae and Tasha are extremely corny and wack as hell. Tasha complains too damn much. Overall this book was pretty good, but I like the first one a lot better."
3,"Wasnt the worst I have read, but it took me awhile to read through it.....","The story was ok.....typical gangsta story where you know that something is gonna go wrong.....cant have it all, huh? It took me awhile to read the story. Usually, if I am really feeling a book, I will read it in 1-2 days, but this story went on for a bit too long. Looking forward to Thug matrimony though. I only want to know if Trae survives."
3,Every Thug Needs A Lady,"Once again I think people are putting too much into this book! It was not the best book for me...It took me too long to read the book for one and then for two it seems like everything is happening over and over again. I also thought that I was going to get some questions answered from the first book but I didn't! So I will have to think long and hard if I want to read the third book...Sorry Wahida, it didn't work for me this time."
3,Not as good as the first two volumes...,"I own all four in the series and hoped the last two would be as satisfying as the first ones, but no. The carols themselves are fine and I'm not going to criticize the musical aspect. What bothers me is the lack of depth in the storytelling that I've come to expect from the 'hymns' books. In those, the children got to peek into the biographical development of each writer and enter into their story a little. The carol stories are not written with the child learner so much in mind, I think, at least in comparison to the earlier volumes. My kids loved and remembered those so well but these stories aren't appealing from their vantage point.Because of the excellence of the 'hymn' volumes my expectations were set high. This one doesn't come close, unfortunately."
5,Phenominal,"Lynyrd Skynyrd is not a guitarist, dude (I'm talking to the last reviewer). It consists of three guitarists, but only two on this album, who are Allen Collins (FreeBird and I Ain't The One solos) and Gary Rossington (Tuesday's Gone and Simple Man solo's). Later the bass player on this album became their third guitarist and he is the one that plays the Sweet Home solo.Ok, this is perhaps my favorite Cd along with Eagles Greatests Hits Volume 1, Appetite For Destruction (Guns N Roses), Eat A Peach (Allman Brothers Band), and maybe Sticky Fingers (Rolling Stones). This album in my eyes is even much superior than the greatest hits CD, and the only track I really think is better from the greatest than any on this CD is Saturday Night Special. But besides that, if you love some great guitar playing, beautiful songs, and some wonderful southern boogie, please check out this CD, you will never regret it."
5,classic Skynyrd,"Lynyrd Skynyrd is the king of Southern rock of course. And there is no doubt that Skynyrd's best song (and one of the best songs in the world) is Freebird. Man, if you got this album for Freebird alone it would be worth it! But this album is filled with classic Skynyrd songs. Tuesday's Gone is one of my personal favorites. Gimme Three Steps is rather humorous (""and I'm tellin' you son that it ain't no fun starin' straight down a forty-four"") Simple Man is beautiful, and Things Goin' On is true to life. You can't listen to this and not be in a good mood. The only thing this album is lacking to be the perfect Skynyrd album is Sweet Home Alabama. But still, a five-star album."
2,Pissed!,Very upset! I paid for overnight shipping on Thursday and it has a delivery date of 9/14/10 and it hasn't even shipped. Guess it wasn't overnight shipping after all and I want a refund for my shipping if I don't receive it. I am very upset!
3,For water maidens and those who love them...,"This work as a whole will enlarge your understanding of water maiden creatures, but don't expect to find any rivetting storytelling.The value of this book lies in its cultural scope. How intriguing to note that water maidens play a significant role in the folk lore of such diverse cultures! And how interesting to see how these creatures vary from country to country (for they are not all mermaids as the title would suggest). Readers will discover an added bonus in Howell's artwork, which enhances the cultural flavor of each tale to great effect.However, each tale is written in a sparse, folk tale style--flat characters and settings with little descriptive embellishments. For this reason I would recommend this book mainly to those who love mermaids and other sea creatures, rather than to those who just looking for a good story. But recommend it I do, for it is a fine collection."
4,Ranging from OK to Stunning,"I, too, ran into difficulties with the MP3 version from various sources. I tried to fix the bad tracks today by downloading replacements. It appears that Amazon has received a better copy of the recording from the studio. The scratchiness and the drop-outs are a thing of the past.So, what do you get? Some really good cornetto and sackbut playing, mixed with a bit of percussion and lute playing. The music itself ranges from OK to sublime. At its best the music moves with a slightly sad, stately grandeur.This is a very enjoyable album."
3,Hmmmm...,"Again, this is another product that must be taken with caution. Do research before buying, just an fyi.. research anything BEFORE you ingest it"
2,Careful with this supplement,"I got this because I had read that dong quai would be helpful with hair & skin. I took as recommended on the label. Within a week I started my period 2 weeks too soon, and it was a painful, crampy one,for more than 7 days. More research led me to understand that this could happen with this product. This supplement has been used for many female reasons, such as prompting your period to come sooner so as to avoid having it while on vacation,for example, or even to help abort when early, early on in pregnancy. So do not take this lightly without doing research and really knowing what you want to use it for. I only gave it 2 stars because it didn't work out for what I originally thought it was for. If I had wanted it to jump start my period, that would be 5 stars!"
4,Right on time,"Product was right on time! I don't know how it works yet, but from reviews hopefully its good for me. I'm going to wait til my cycle is near to start."
3,Best as it can be in offset reproductions,"Certainly the book does a decent job at reproducing the images, but if you have seen Chagalls images, you know that his work is best viewed in real life. This is due to the fact that his work uses a lot of relief, not just colours. But prints can only go so far to show this. Try to get thee to a museum that showcases his work, it will be worth the trip!"
2,1887-1985 with a TON of omissions,"Buyer Beware... I shoulda known better.The 3 Chagall paintings I'm researching were NOT even mentioned.I guess I can tear up some of the pages, and use as kindling.Maybe this Kindle-thing might help."
5,I just love it!!!,"I spent a lot of time deciding on which MP3 to buy and this was my criteria:* Compact, light weight.* Good for jogging.* Enough memory to store 10-15 songs, but with the option to upgrade in the future.* Unexpensive.* Good quality.* Compatible with XPSo far, this player has met all my criteria, this was the MP3 player I was looking for. The thing I love the most is its compact size makes it ideal for jogging. It comes with carry on accesories to strap it on your wrist, arm, or hang it around your neck. The sound quality is good, I can't complain. And one of my biggest fears was incompatibility with XP, since it is not officially supported and I've read some imcompatibility problems for the Kazoo that comes with 64MB RAM. Anyway that wasn't a problem at all, the revision of the CD it came with had the drivers for XP, and it runs smoothly except you have to use the MusicMatch software provided. Overall this was a great buy, I don't regret it!"
2,Grrrr...,"I'm cranky about this product. It was good. It was great in fact. It was on its way to FIVE stars. But then it ... out on me. After 3 weeks. And it took 6 days for RCA to get back to me about the fact that it wouldnt play. (Yes, I changed the batteries.) And you know what they said? ""Check the manual."" Gee thanks. Anyway, I'll be getting a replacement from RCA, by golly, but I'm still pretty torn up about wasting time."
3,decent but parts broke,"I bought mine about 2 years ago and it's still working. However after about 1 year the hold switch broke right off, i tryed to contact rca a couple of times but I never recived any help so a month ago i managed to fix it myself. I'm planning to upgared soon because; space is very limited, and there are a alot of new fetures out there.I did find the resampling fuction in musicmatch really useful.As i said it's still working after 2 years!"
1,If i could rate it less I would,"This is horrible MP3 player. The first one I got just stopped working, i changed batteries and everything but nohing helped. So i took it back thinking it was only a little prolem. After about a week the second one I got only would send music to one side of any set of headphones that i tried. In short If you want to spend 70 - 100 dollars buy a Rio. They work wonderfully"
1,Works...sometimes,"Used sporadically for 2 years. Sometimes it won't turn on, sometimes it will. It makes no sense. Downloading music to it is a time consuming, frustrating chore. I would not recommend this to anybody."
1,Terrible,"This is the second RCA MP3 player I purchased. The first one was the RD1020. I received an error message every time I tried to download music into the external disc. So I gave up on it and returned it. So I thought this time I would try another RCA model, RD1060. At first I thought it was great then the batteries died within 15 minutes of play. First I thought it was the batteries so I replaced the batteries. Well, the same thing happened when I replaced the batteries. So I'm giving up on RCA products. My suggestion if you are going to buy an MP3 player definitely do your research.Also the customer service department is absolutely no help. If you buy it and experience problems just return it. Don't waste your time trying to fix the problem through customer service."
4,perfect,this one is perfect. its very user friendly. within 1 hr i had music on it.. the 64 is good too.. i have like an hr and a half worth of music on there.
2,It broke on me,"Well, I bought this kazoo player a little over a month ago. I thought it was going to be great. I thought I was going to be able to run with it, listen to it on the subway, etc... About a week after I bought it, I had trouble with the usb connection. It was apparent that the problem was with the actual unit. The USB cable just doesn't connect well to the player. It keeps getting disconnected. Not physically falling out, mind you, its just the fact that the connection breaks every so often and the computer says that the unit is disconnected when in reality it is. It was bearable at first but it kept getting worse and worse until finally I can't even put more than two songs on it without it becoming disconnected. I guess that's what you get for paying seventy nine dollars for an mp3 player. Maybe I just got a bad apple, but I was very displeased with my purchase."
1,Broke after 5 months,I used to use this for my daily workouts on the elliptical machine. After about 5 months it just stopped working entirely...too much money for too little time.
3,You get what you pay for,"This player is worth what you pay for it. Don't expect too much. Music sounds good when ripped at 128, but you lose alot by reducing the rate. I have another MP3 player (Samsung Mini-Yepp) that sounds as good at 96 as this one does at 128.I originally bought it for running and working out. Unfortunately, the carrying case is made of cheap plastic and broke within two weeks. The unit itself is also seems very light and fragile.The display, while large and easy to view, does not show track title or artist, which is just a ""nice to have"".On the positive side, adding additional storage to the K@zoo is very easy and inexpensive. I have upgraded to 128 and can store almost 2 hours of music at 128MB.The best part of this unit is the software provided (which was a major factor in my decision to purchase it). I had been using MusicMatch for over a year and is very versitile.SUMMARY: It is an excellent ""starter"" MP3 player, but I would not advise buying it for atheletic purposes."
2,Disapointed,"I was excited to get my new K@zoo mp3 player, and when I got it it took only 10 minutes to get all of the things set up on my computer and another 5 minutes to get about 19 songs onto it. All was decent for about 3 weeks. Within the 3 week span, I went through over 20 pairs of batteries. I put brand new batteries in and the display shown the low battery signal. Then one day I was listening to it while I was working out and shut it off when i was done. An hour later it would not turn back on again. I put brand new batteries in and nothing happened. I was happy for a little, then I was just plain disappointed. Don't buy this product."
3,Great Sound; Bad Unit?,"I received the RD1060 as a Christmas Gift. I'm giving the product 3 stars because the sound is so good but the one problem that I have with it is not minor. The headphone connection is faulty and has been since I received it. If you move even slightly, the connection switches from stereo to mono repeatedly and with a scratchy sound. I tried 4 seperate sets of headphones; all with the same result. As it is now, it is not usable. Now I must wait to get a replacement and hope that I don't have the same problem (or some other problem) with the new one."
2,Good Product with 1 Flaw,"The flaw: Every time you start it up it begins at track # 1 and then you have to manually fast forward, track by track, to get to where you left off. This can be labourious (sp?) considering that, with 64Mb of memory, it holds 135 minutes of audio (at 64 bit sound quality, comparable to FM radio).-Fast forwarding through all these tracks is slow because, like an old CD player, you have to 1. FF to a track 2. wait for it to start the track and 3. then FF to the next track. In other words, if you just press the FF button 30 times as fast as you can you'll only be on track 4.The overall construction of the product is quite acceptable and, to double the memory, a 64MB MMCard can be bought for around $ although it seems this would only compound the problem of the aforementioned flaw."
3,good little player,i bought this mp3 player a while ago and it was great. good music for working out or studying in the library. not many songs fit on the player but i am sure if i sprung for the extra memory it would be fine. when i first got the player i had windows 98 on my old computer and when i upgraded couldnt for the life of me figure out why it wouldnt work. guess it doesnt work with xp...which didnt really matter when i first bought it. now i have to find a way to work around that slight setback. but other then that it was great. i didnt like the headphones but that was easily fixable. since everyone has different preferances on those anyway. i recomend it for those who dont need to store massive ammounts of music at a time and who dont need the latest technology since it is a year or two old i believe. good for the price. i would get it again... just stinks that now i have windows xp and not 98.
2,Planned obsolescence at it's finest,This player worked great while it was within the one year warranty. The month after that warranty expired the player ceased to function. I contacted RCA's customer service and was politely told that if I mail the player to them they would replace it for [money]. Now I am wishing I had bought a heavier player so it would at least make a decent paper weight.
5,BAD MOVIE LOVER HEAVEN!!,"""My God! It looks like a proboscis!"" One of the many great lines in this hilariously badly written, badly acted, cheesily photographed little gem of a film. You're in for a treat when you realize that the action is funnier than the comic relief. The scientists and much of the plot is lifted right from ""Food of the Gods;"" the climax is reminiscent of ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""The Birds;"" and the dialogue is delivered with all the emotion of the funeral attendees from ""Plan Nine From Outer Space."" You gotta see it to believe it!"
4,mosquito,"its a good four star, lots of action and few funny scenes but mostely scary big mosquitos. they team up with a few bad guys to out fightthe mosquitos"
1,$64?!?!,Anybody who buys this DVD used for 64 dollars is a sucker! i love a good B horror flick as much as the next person but not for 64 dollars...i can go to suncoast and get it for 3 dollars. Sorry amazon..your not getting my business for this dvd.
4,Great.,"This movie was the best cheesy movie I have ever seen. It has bad special effects, I mean there was no acting and the dialogue was repetitive. Such as that girl who kept saying I want to bring it back to the lab to examine it. The funniest part was when the mosquito got a guy going to the bathroom. It was hilarious and the part where the mosquito got stuck on the door and the kept hitting it and it looked like a pile of jam. I recommend this movie as a cheesy movie and a good laugh."
4,A Real Eye Popper,"Okay, I'll be honest. This movie is no classic by any means, but it's still a good, enjoyable, big bug flick. Allright, so the dialauge is cheesey but if you're watching this movie for ""well thought out dialouge"", there's something wrong with you. However, with the exeception of the stop motion animation (Ugh...), this movie has special effects A LOT better than some reviews state. Although I recommend this movie to horror fans or people who don't expect Spielburg, I don't reccomend this to people who DON'T like gross stuff (If you don't, I pity you) because a guy's eyes EXPLODE (yes. You read right. A guy's eyes explode). All in all, a good big bug film with good monsters. BBBBBBUUUUUUUUUUZZZZZZZZZZZ....SWAT!"
4,For an excellent textbook and reference look no further.,"After taking many years of french instruction this is the book I come back to now. Clear examples, concise explanations, and an index that a french student can use to find what is needed. Pair this with a good French-English dictionary and you're set."
4,Fujifilm Finepix S5200 5.1MP Digital Camera,"Second day the stainless steel ring failed of from the lens. After few hundred pictures the message appeared on the screen ""Focus error"" and camera stopped working. I'm very disappointed with Fuji for poor quality of this product ."
2,No lens Cover,Very Good Camera... however I did not get a lens cover that was suspose to be included... contacted the seller and was told one would be shipped out.. Still have not received the cover. Not satistied without the lens cover for this camera. I have sentseveral e-mails trying to contact the seller with no response.
1,5.1 CAMERA,I LOVE THE CAMERABUT THE ONLY THING THAT DOESN'T WORK IS WHEN I PLUG IN MY 5V. AC ADAPTOR
5,Great camera,"I bought this camera for my wife's birthday and after 2 months of use she LOVES it. Easy to use, light weight, takes great sharp pictures. She told me I out did myself with this buy!"
5,He loves it!!!,I purchased this camera for my husband and loves it. He did plenty of research before he picked this one and left settle hints :). It has the best lag time for the price range and the zoom is great. The photos that are taken with it look wonderful. He doesn't have a single complaint.
5,Awesome camera,"I love this camera. When I reluctantly decided to change from film to digital, I found this camera. I have sold many photo's with this camera. It's a better outside camera. Takes awesome pictures. You can't beat the color. Learn all the settings too. Manuel mode is a joy. Great color. Fun to learn to get back to the basics of taking pictures. I wish it was as good indoors with a flash. I am now looking at a DSLR just because of the need for a faster camera with a flash. This will always be my back-up until it no longer works. I highly recommended this camera to anyone. You won't be sorry."
3,"Great camera, but not that much better than the old","I have an older Fuji and this new one is twice as powerful as that one, but I don't see a great deal of improvement in the pictures. Don't get me wrong its a great camera and the batteries last a lot longer in this one, but if you already own a 6X with 2.5 MP you really do not need this particular camera."
5,5200,"Excellent camera. Does an outstanding job on scenic shots with good color rendition and clear pictures. I've used it to take scenics of farms, fields, and some shots of red tail hawks and it has performed well. Good battery life using standard alkaline AA batteries."
2,"Good ""starter"" camera but not much else..","I have to admit, this camera was my first ""step up"" into the world of digital photography and in the beginning, it was wonderful! As with most electronics go, technology moves forward while everything else gets left behind. What I liked about this camera was that it was easy to use, had multi functions and a flash. What I didnt like about it was that you couldn't change any of the lenses out and although it had a lot of features for its time, it was still rather limited.5.1mp is nothing these days. Most cameras have at least 8mp if not more and even the crap tastic el cheapo cameras have more mega pixlels than this thing.I have since upgraded to a Nikon d3100 and have retired this camera. I would try to sell it but I wouldnt get much for it considering it's age and how far technology has advanced since this camera came out.I would recommend this camera to young adults, elderly people and beginners who need a ""dummies guide"" to take pictures. (no offense)"
4,Fujifilm FinePix S5200 Camera,"I think this would be an excellent camera but I have not had the time to read the instruction manual. It is not the best if all you want to do is point and shoot. You need to know a little about photography. I am a little disappointed with the 10x optical zoom. I thought I would be able to zoom in close to take photos of birds, etc - but it just doesn't seem to zoom in very much. It could just be me though because I don't know how to use it except in automatic mode."
5,Nothing Less Than Amazing,I went from taking the camera out of its packing to taking professional quality pictures in twenty minutes. It's amazing!
3,"Be careful of ""Zoom Error""","I love this camera because of its powerful zoom and other features. But I have to return it to the store now because of the ""Zoom Error"" message displayed on the LCD after I played this camera for 3 weeks. Luckily it is still covered by 30 day return policy. After I searched on Google I found a lot of reports about the ""Fuji Zoom Error"" issue. It seems that the zoom mechanism of Fuji camera is not so reliable."
5,Exceptional Camera for Beginners,"My first digital was an Olympus Stylus 400, and it served me well for about two years... until I went to a convention and tried to take an great number of indoor pictures and use the zoom. The Olympus was wholely inadequate. So, I bought the Fujifilm Finepix S5200 and it's a fantastic camera. It's easy enough for the beginner to use right out of the box and contains enough settings, buttons, and extras to give the no-so-beginner plenty to sink their teeth into. This is a camera I can grow with as my knowledge and skills increase, and I am looking forward to that. My partner is an exceptional photographer who uses a manual medium format and he LOVES what the Fujifilm S5200 produces VERY please with my purchase."
4,Nice camera for the price,"Nice camera , easy to use . I'm still studing how to use it correctly. Also , I have a sony camera of 4.1 megapixels and I think the picture itself has better quality...."
2,Hold off for awhile...,I love Fuji digital cameras and believe that you cannot beat the image quality. Everything other reviewers have said is true but the one thing that makes this camera pretty much unusable for me is the extremely weak flash. I'm a Realtor and need great indoor shots of large rooms. This camera says the flash goes 13 feet but even that is not strong enough. I took a photo of a beautifully set dining room table. The first few feet was lit..the rest was not. I thought of using this camera for only outdoor photos but even that won't work a lot of the time. When taking people pictures I almost always force a flash so that their faces are not in the shade. I took dozens of people photos of an outdoor charity event I sponsored with a forced flash and none of the faces came out.If enough people complain about the flash I'm hoping Fuji will improve upon it. As for now I need to go shopping for another camera.
5,Fujifilm Continues with Great Quality !,"Read all the reviews, and finally considered the Canon S-2, Sony H-2, and the Fujifilm S5200. Previously had the S5100 and loved it. The S5200 was my choice and I'm very satisfied. Great "" blurr "" setting enables great shots from a distance on Auto without distortion. Very fast shutter time is Great for capturing movement shots. And the colors are unbelievable and crisp. Great deal on Amazon too. A great quality camera for less money."
5,Fujifilm still has bang for the buck,"We bought this camera to complement a small 3.2 MP camera that was very portable but not very capable in comparison. We love the S5200's performance. My very first digital was a 2.0 MP Finepix - which is now used by our 7 year old - and it took great photos and lasted many years. Battery use is terrific - our other brand 3.2 MP will go through 4 sets of batteries before we need to replace the ones in the S5200. The video with sound works great and is high quality. If you are looking for a good camera with a great zoom and LOTS of features, and you don't want to pay a ton of money... we recommend the Fujifilm Finepix S5200."
4,Excellent for the price,"I am pleased with this camera. Its pretty easy to use. I have virtually no camera experience, save for breaking them. This camera is easy to operate and is pretty fun to fool around with. I have used the aperture setting several times to get different focus points on the pics. The instructions were easy to comprehend. I have taken quite a bit of Sports photos and I have noticed its extremely difficult to get shots inside a gymnasium. The shots are usually very blurry and the color just isn't right most of the time. Fluorescent modes on the camera are helpful, but do not fix the problem. It could just be me though."
4,Best Camera and soft ware ever,The zoom speed on this camera is tops of all the cameras I have and the software pkg is 10 times better and compatible to all MS systems softwares I have never had so much fun taking pics for my self this camera is the bomb.
2,Too philosophical and detailed.,I found this book to be far too detailed in analyzing and comparing the moral guiding precepts of Jefferson. Jefferson was an enigma in his often contradicting beliefs and practices. I had hoped this book would have more concisely elaborated on these inconsistencies with fewer words. I stopped reading the book after a few chapters.
5,Land of the Loon is Best music and nature sounds CD ever,I have looked all over for the Perfect nature sounds and music CD and I believe I have found it! The nature souds are incredibly real (and non-looped) and the music is perfectly partnered. I love it!
3,Not enough loons,"I'm a bit disappointed with this CD only because there are not enough loon calls for my taste. There are other sounds of nature, which is great, but not the reason I bought this CD. Also, there is the always present music in the background. I have CDs that are purely frog sounds, thunderstorms, etc. without anything else. When my brother and I were in Canada and sat on the dock at a lake at night, all we heard were loons -- no music. Why not a CD of loon calls with nothing else on it?"
4,Pleasant listening.,"I like to fall asleep to Land of the Loon playing softly. It's pleasant listening and relaxing. The loon sounds are very good - there is a bit too much water that sounds less like a lake than a shower, but I'd recommend this to loon lovers."
2,NOT FOR APARTMENT KIDS!,I will not have my son read this particular book so that he will not know all that he misses being in an apartment...
5,Best CD we bought in 2006,"My husband and I first saw (heard of) Benton Paul at a private concert sponsored by my husband's company last summer in Provo, Utah. We actually went to the concert to see Maren Ord (a canadian singer-songwriter whose albums we love) and Benton Paul was there with her. By the end of the concert, we were as thrilled to have discovered Benton Paul as we were to finally hear Maren in concert. We bought his CD (Wise & the Weak) and it ended up being the best album we purchased all year.Best songs on the album (in our opinion)Leave BetterWomen Are A Necessary EvilHere's To The BoysWise & The Weak (Album Title)I actually used the song, ""Leave Better"" on a video presentation I created at work and every time I do the presentation, people ask where they can download the song. I definitely recommend this CD. It's unique, fun and Benton is a talented song-writer & musician."
2,A bit simplistic,It was well written but provided only a glimpse into gang life and leaving it. Excellent photography but a bit disappointing overall.
1,a difficult read,"Not recommended.Costs 50% more than Parker's ""The Boundary-Scan Handbook"", is much more difficult to read, and has less useful information. There are frequent typographical errors, and the material is disorganized - for example, the section describing the INTEST command neglects to mention that 1149.1 requires that the chip's inner circuitry must be single-steppable - single-stepping for INTEST is only indirectly referred to in a later section describing RUNBIST. Many of the 1149.1 requirements aren't integrated with the main discussion of a topic where they could be most readily digested, but are relegated to an appendix that appears to be something of an afterthought."
2,I was specting more.......,"I'm a Mechanical Engineer and I'm doing a MSc in materials and manufacturing processes.I'm from Colombia, South America. You could say it's a ""developing country"" but may be not, I find here better books than this.I'm owner of this book, I thought that an Algor publishing work could be great, but it doesn't.Using this book, you'll not learn so much about finite elements, it's like a description about what ALGOR can do, but doesn't explains in a good manner what finite elements analysis is.If you want a really good book, the classic, Zienkiewicz and ""The finite element method"" could be, Bathe too. But Spyrakos, mmmmmmmmm it's for someone who doesn't know anything about FEA and wants to know what FEA means, no more.Printing also, it's not as I expected."
4,"Good science, pick your flavor carefully","I'll say that I feel like I have more endurance when I am drinking this stuff vs Gatorade. I also haven't gotten muscle soreness the next couple days after a hard workout like I used to sometimes. So I'll be buying Accelerade again.But whatever you do, try the flavors first. Lemon-lime is very bad tasting. May daughter called it ""yucky lemonade"" and a friend of mine said it ""tastes like the inside of a climbing shoe smells"".I've also found it doesn't mix that well. My trick is to fill the water about 2/3 of the way up and add the power to that so it doesn't stick to the sides of the container as much. Then fill the water the rest of the way up and shake it. If you are making it farther in advance use hot water so it dissolves better and throw it in the fridge."
3,reasonable value,"although other club members prefer Hammer nutrition products I had a hard time paying Filet Mignon prices for powder. Accelerade is a very good product and although it's still too expensive IMO it does the job, dissolves well, and works well in longer rides over 2 hours. I've tried cheaper stuff and was disappointed so there's a baseline here.PS, be wary of ""best brand values"" or any other rip-off that bundles a monthly ""membership fee"" with your purchase. Amazon does not screen for this"
4,Excellent,Fist time user of this product and i feel well hydrated. This product makes training for a Marathon a lot easier.
4,"Love the effect, hate the taste","Firstly, this stuff cured my bonking. That's worth a re-buy all by itself.Pros:Formulation is excellent for any type of riding.Contains protein to help muscle recoveryGood blend of simple and complex sugarPowder mixes evenly and quicklyCons:Spoils within 24 hours, no more mixing the night before and loading it on the bike.Protein in the drink gives it a not-quite-chalky aftertasteslightly sticky, if it drips, be prepared for a long cleaning session.Overall, I wish they made accelerade without the protein - then it'd be fine. The protein is what causes it to spoil. As it is, though, I'll look for something else next time."
3,Will update after Jan,I have been using this product to help with long runs and rides. It has done the job so far but I am unsure if the product is complete.
4,taste crappy but it works~,"it works. it simply works. it taste like crap. but you get use to it. actually, i don't mind it at all anymore....it's awesome. order it. i do p90x and insanity."
3,Dont like the taste,Accelerade is backed by published research a rarity in the sports supplement market. However I really don't like the taste of the Lemon-Lime.
3,Ok drink,Tastes ok but always leave flecks in suspension which coat the insdie of your bottles and Camel Bak in no time. Then it looks like an orange slime mold growing on the inner surfaces of everything and you can't tell if it's going bad or just sticking to things. Definitely reduces fatigue on longer rides (> ~50mi).
2,Ok But Too Many Issues,I cycle +100 miles per week and have tried a number of different sports drink and food products. On recommendation from other local riders I normally use Cytomax (old version orange and citrus) which I really like but purchased Accelerade because I was out and Accelerade was all they had at the bike shop. The product is ok but has too many negative side-effects so I'm going back to Cytomax and throwing out the rest of my Accelerade. These include:1. It usually gives me a slight stomach ache2. It totally gunks up my water bottles and caps and hard to clean3. I find it a little chalky in taste. On hot days it actually made me more thirsty and I had to switch to regular water.-ACH
3,Hard to mix,"I've tried both this product and Endurox and although Accelerade tastes a lot better it's very hard to mix. There's always clumps floating around my bottle. I feel like a lot of it is being wasted. The Endurox mixes a lot more easily, all the powder dissolves.As far as effects. They're both about the same. The Endurox has more protein so I assume it's better for immediate muscle recovery but the feeling I get from both drinks are the same.I tried both so I can decide which I like better and I'm going with the Endurox."
2,Tastes bad.,"Trying to find an inexpensive energy drink, but I wish I could return this... B/c it tastes horrible."
3,Cough Syrup,"I got the 6-pack of the Fruit Punch at a sport store just to try it out. I drank it for the first time today and it was GROSS. It was like drinking cough syrup. I wanted to dilute it with water since the taste was so strong, but then I didn't because that means I would have to drink more of it. I don't know what to do with the other 5 packs.However, I did feel like my recovery time was slightly better/quicker. I'm not sure if that was just a psychological thing because the package says ""speeds muscle recovery"". I give it a 3-star because I will assume that it did its job of a sports drink. Minus 2 stars for the horrible taste."
3,Tastes Horrible!,"Tastes bad, like spoiled Sherbet. Drink mix is mostly sugar (Sucrose) with a bit of milk protein.My Recommendation. Get Muscle Milk by CytoSport and mix it with Gatorade power. If that's not enough, add table sugar. Tastes better and works the same."
4,Solid Product,"I've been using Accelerade for over a year now. It is a good product at a pretty reasonable price. I train relatively hard and use this during and after tough workouts. It really does help to stop the nausea that sets in. It's not the best tasting stuff, but after the first couple of time using it, I got used to it."
4,"good, but kind of cheap","It's a good product. The lights are lighter in color than stock which I think is a drastic improvement. The chrome however is clearly an afterthought and looks like it could fall off at any moment. I'm sure it's adhered well, but looking at it closely you'd wonder also. They fit and look good but the quality is just a hair below OEM."
4,"a ""children's opera"" for adults","This opera is for those who are tired of the standard repertoire. I was attracted to the Decca recording of this opera on discs, with Lucia Popp, because it was so unusual (cartoon animal and human characters, episodic anti-romantic story). Even though I found it highly intriguing, I could not sustain my concentration beyond the first act. I was attracted to this DVD because I was curious how the animal roles could be staged. The real stars here are Director Nicholas Hytner and Bob Crowley's vividly colorful sets. Some scenes are genuinely funny (the vixen killing the chicken). Even though I sustained concentration through two acts out of three, this is a very unique (and rare) production, of the kind you will rarely see in any opera house. Technically excellent, a strong buy recommendation (only 4 stars out of caution - try any other piece by Janacek first to see if you warm up to it)."
5,History made personal,"If you're a fan of meticulously researched historical novels and great storytelling, this book is for you. In Bathshua, Bojan Hamlin Jennings takes an actual historical event - the murder of a Massachusetts trader during Revolutionary War times and the trial of his wife for complicity in the crime - and fashions a compelling novel with fascinating characters. Two stories unfold side by side - the historical one of the founding of our country, and Bathshua's personal story. As the colonies struggle for independence, we see Bathshua more and more deeply imprisoned in an abusive marriage to a man who is not what he seems. Author Jennings skillfully creates an entirely plausible motive for the murder, and takes us through the trial, the first of its kind in the new American court system. I was up late finishing this one."
1,save your money,"I was very disappointed with this DVD, it was not helpful with training a dog with none at all. She uses her own dog that is very well trained, it would be helpful to use a dog that is not so you can see what to do in those situations. Plus her presentation needs improvement."
1,The worst and expensive DVD to train dogs ever!!,"I got 10 different DVD's to train dogs and this DVD is the worst and expensive DVD ever made. The ""Trainer"" claims to train dogs since she was 9 years old and she is the best dogs' trainer: I really doubt it.The truth she does not train any dog in this DVD, she uses already trained dogs and most of the time she just talks on her couch.Not only that, her own dog usually does not obey her commands, she pulls her dog with the leash to command her dog to ""FOLLOW"" and with her hands she forces the dog to obey the commands ""SIT"" or ""DOWN""There are several fantastic DVD's sold in Amazon and are cheaper: Kyra Sundance, Shannon Holstein and Nicole Wilde are really good, with more commands, using puppies and different never trained dogs.This DVD either goes back or to the dumpster"
2,waaaaack. hard to follow.,"I spent most of the book trying to figure out what was going on. I got some of it, and parts it were interesting, but those parts were scarce. It was all over the place, jumbled, and confusing. Don't bother."
2,old fashion,"i did't like this book at all. The rooms that were displayed, looked very out dated. It wasn't very hopeful to me at all."
1,Proof that you can discuss the holocaust,"Dr. Sindi: ""The freedom in the West stops when it comes to discussing the `holocaust' freely.""That's why this book is even for sale. I've already read enough - won't bother buying."
1,Holocaust denier,"Despite the fact that Dr Sindi may (or may not) be correct about the Israeli-Palestinian situation, and the contribution of the Arabs to Western Civilisation, it is also a fact that he is a Holocaust denier (check out this link here: http://abbc.net/sindi/typic.htm). The link was from his website (http://members.aol.com/AMS44AMS/).Given that he can make such a fundamental error with regards the history of world war 2, I think his other 'conclusions' about Arabic history should be taken with a pinch of salt."
1,A rancid pile of Anti-Semitic garbage,Save your money and keep down your lunch by not buying this book. The author is a Holocaust denying Anti-Semite and the book is worthless.
4,Snow day,Funny kids movie and great to watch on a snow day. Kids can see all that they can do on a snow day.
4,The kids love it,My kids have loved this movie for years! Now all three are in college and around the holiday break they acutally hung out and watched it together.
3,not my cup of tea,"I thought I;d give Wodehouse a try, but as I suspected, he's not my cup of tea. Most of the characters are unbelievably silly. And why be truthful if a fib can serve? I prefer humor to be more realistic, with more normal people involved."
2,Amusing? Sometimes. Hilarious? Not Really.,"Be sure you buy this book with the right expectations. It's not a collection of uniformly hilarious bungles like the ""Anguished English"" series. As an earlier reviewer noted, there are a few genuinely funny bloopers mixed with many, many dry errors of fact, number, or spelling. There's an irritating undertone of ""Look how we at the great New York Times can laugh at ourselves"" here, and it doen't make for entertaining reading."
2,Ho-hum,"Wish I'd read the customer reviews before I bought it. A bit of humor, but mostly tedious. Disappointing."
2,If thai pose make you laugh...,The truly humorous entries are few and far between. The bulky rest make an interesting study of writing mistakes which might be helpful to aspiring editors.
4,Good reference guide,"Use this book as a sort of guidance counselor. Mr. Lancaster wrote the short easy-to-read chapters much like a career journal column in the Wall Street Journal.All of the chapters won't apply to everyone, but Lancaster does a good job of moving along the topic with good specific examples.A quick read that will stay on my referral shelf. All topics covered should apply now and in the future to all of us out there with difficult jobs, bosses and decisions to be made. Good stuff!"
2,Nothing New,"Mr. Lancaster manages to pick some of the most intriguing topics for the ""lessons"" in his book, but time after time he glosses over them without saying much of anything new. These short essays (most are two pages long) do not have enough meat to make this book work. The table of contents looks good, but the payoff is just not there."
2,Poor sound quality,"If you're looking to recreate the experience you had at a Soul Coughing show, I'd suggest you look elsewhere. This recording is a weak (at best) audience recording that is muffled, muddled, and boomy. I was almost entirely disappointed."
4,Not a great release,"Soul Coughing being one of my favorite bands ever, this series of live recordings was a bit maddening. None of these are, as some here have said, audience recordings. They have clearly mixed an audience mic into the final mix, but this is very typical in order to moisten the mix a bit. That being said, not much care was taking in separating each track and giving it the love it so richly deserved. The editing is also completely appalling. Seeing how cheap these releases have become, it may be worth it to the die-hard fan, but don't introduce yourself to the live ouevre of Soul Coughing via this series of recordings.....find a friend with a bootleg instead."
4,"Yeah the sound quality's not great, but this disc is TIGHT","Ooh, they tear it up in this concert. $300 and Miss the Girl are some serious drum 'n bass jams and Yuval is sublime on the drums. The encore performance of Screenwriter's Blues is goosebumps-good. The audio quality is rather cavernous and raw but far better than what I've heard of the other releases in this series. If you're a Soul Coughing fan, GET THIS ALBUM. If not, probably starting with the studio stuff is the way to go... THEN get this album.P.S. I just wish Doughty would freestyle less. It's not his strong suit."
3,A nice selection of pieces,"This was an adequate boxed set. Many of the pieces were well played by established orchestras and conductors.Nothing earth shattering, but a very nice value if you are looking for lots of classical pieces."
5,"Finally, the road map for teens to really become successful!","If you want to help your child leap ahead in learning and leveraging time tested success and life skills, then buy this book now. Kids will ""get it"" because the author speaks their language. I highly recommend this book for parents and teachers wanting to help any teen or young adult they care about get ahead in life.This book is easy to read, the excercises are thought provoking and relevant to what kids need today."
3,Drill Press Excellent,"These worked perfectly cutting wood while chucked in a drill press. As other reviewers have noted, they are uncontrollable when using a hand drill."
2,china made,"i use to buy these bits all the time but now the quity isnt there since thier makin them in china as use to be in germany,so ive had to go to usa bits ,may pay a bit more but well worth it!!i wish that amazon would make all sellers give locations on items that are made!!"
3,"Good, but defective","I ordered these bits to primarily help me drill out a bolt that broke off on my car. I began by using a small bit, lubricated it and used a low RPM to get the hole started. The bit worked great for 5 seconds, piercing through the bolt. Then it broke in half. I then used a bit that was one size larger and the same result!A buddy of mine has the same exact set and when I used his the bits worked perfectly and got the job done easily. The set I ordered must have been defective, perhaps not tempered long enough? Will return to Amazon."
5,Dewalt DW1263 14 piece Cobalt Pilot Point Twist Drill Bit,I purchased the Dewalt cobalt drill bits for home use. Being a homeowner I am always repairing or maintaining things around the house. I am pleased with how easy the drill bits drill both into metal and wood. I use them with my variable speed cordless drill and it makes my work a lot easier. It's nice to have the right tool for the job. I would recomend this product to anyone.
4,Cobalt bits.,"I had to drill through some hardened steel. My regular bits couldn't hack it and the titanium bits weren't much better. These worked great. Just remember to use cutting oil or the bits will break. Be careful with them because they are hard, but brittle."
1,Plastic Drill Bits for Metal,"These drill bits are great for SOFT materials - wood, plastic, rubber, aluminum, gold, silver, tin, and other soft metals. They are USELESS when needed for hard metals - steel, stainless steel, titanium, and other hard metals despite their ""cobalt"" claim - you might as well use plastic drill bits, they are much cheaper and accomplish the same result: a costly nothing."
5,DEWALT DW1263 13-Piece Cobalt Split-Point Drill Bit Set,DEWALT DW1263 13-Piece Cobalt Split-Point Drill Bit Set: Nice set product and packaging wise!
3,"Great perfume, horrible bottling","I am not going to knock on Jivago..because it is a great perfume..it is all I wear! However this time when I ordered the bottle was not working properly! I couldn't spray it for nothing..I tried to clean the nozzle many different ways. I eventually ended up using pliers to get the top off, so now I have a broken hole in the top and I have to apply the perfume with a cotton ball. And I noticed later that the attachment inside where the perfume is supposed to come through had a block inside of it..I mean really?!?!? I will continue to use it but may look for a different supplier!"
4,Brighten the darkness,"This is the book that I used when I first time learning numerical methods. It has very clear explanations which could open my eyes, brighten the darkness of my numerical knowledge. Now I am using it as a textbook for numerical class that I teach. Highly recommended for the beginners."
4,good correclation with newer editions,is an older edition than the one I'm using in my class. It was a lot cheaper and there are little differences between the old and new editions.
3,A excellent book ruined by clutter,"The basic content of the book is excellent. However, in trying to cover different packages and/or languages the book loses its charm.This book is a glaring example of how an otherwise excellent textbook can be ruined by clutter. If the authors had stayed with Fortran/C or Matlab (but not both) and provided more of ready made programs or subroutines, it would be a lot more useful."
1,Look elsewhere for information on numerical analysis.,"I used this textbook for a term while taking a class in numerical methods. I found this book to be a poor reference to material needed for real applications. It is difficult to supplement the material, as it does not explain methods well. The examples it does give, rely too heavily on previous examples. A greater focus is needed on the current method, rather than flipping back to past material. I recommend using a different book."
4,My son watch it every day,"My 20 months old son like it very much and he want to watch it every day. Although he may not understand the story, the songs are very attractive for him."
5,Natural Magick is Great!,"Love this book! From beginning to end it is filled with simple, yet powerful magicks that any witch could add to their BoS. Loaded with ideas, spells, and other magical info, this book has earned a place on my book shelf."
4,A very good book on the basics of nature's mysteries,"I liked the book. Obviously it is not specifically detailed about one facet of magic but it is natural, wholesome and mainly the right-hand path. Clearly written, and by obviously a very qualified person, it is highly recommended to all."
3,"Ok, but not great","I used over half the bottle on my Mizuno glove, let it sit overnight, and when I used it the next day, I found that it was much softer, but still not broken in. Maybe I should have let it sit longer but on the other hand I've had gloves that brake in the moment the oil is used on them. Also it was not fun dealing with the liquid oil that got all over my clothes and made a mess in my lawn. I'd suggest a spray on oil instead of this."
4,Great book on Schnauzers,This book is very insightful. Great way to learn about Standard Schnauzers and be a better owner. I would recommend this book.
5,Awesome Live concert.,"Just understand it was recorded long ago, so the quality isn't as high as today's music. But Joe Sample, Wilton Felder, BB King, jamming with the Royal Philharmonic- it's just too good to pass up!"
3,you must see this movie alone..........,"The Dirty Seven (¡82)-dir. Bruno Fontana-ITALY-One-note shoot-em-up action drama that turns into a rape-revenge film. The only real reason to see this is for Laura Gemser who, taking revenge on her sister who was raped & murdered by a group of militant assassins, uses her body to turn the men against each other! Recommended for Gemser completists only! RATED ¡R¡"
2,Could of being good with a better video producer,"This video is irritating. This could of being a good video if the producer & teacher had known what they was doing.This is the worst video tape quality I have ever seen. Three bad (breaks ?) during the 45 minutes.I cannot recommend this video for beginners because of the bad camera angles, bad techniques, bad teaching. If you can follow by his voice commands alone then okay but for beginners this video would take lots of viewing. They cut the senior dancers out of the screen & change the camera angle about every 15 seconds throughout the whole workout. By the finish the music was driving me nuts. I have watched this video just once now I am going to throw it in the garage & forget about it. I recommend you try some of the other Salsa Aerobic videos on the market."
4,Manual,"It is a good manual. I prefer the Haynes one, but this is ok.I find it a bit hard to understand at times, would like more illisrations, but is good."
2,What I read wasn't what I got,"I didn't have any clue in the description that it was a Christian book. After I got it in the mail I noticed that nearly every page had Christian quotes or references to the bible. I'm sure it's a good book for Christians. I see some positive reviews here, but I thought I'd offer a friendly warning to those who are not Christians."
5,What you say Is what you get!!,"This book was great. After I read it, I ordered 3 more copies so I could share it with my sisters and brother. I have read it several times, and get something new out of it each time. I have learned a lot from ""What you Say is What you Get"". It really works... Say postive stuff get postive stuff, say negative things get negative things.I love it!"
3,Mediocre,"Be knowledgeable about your industry. Be knowledgable about your company. Be knowledgeable about your required job skills. Communicate well with people. Set goals for yourself. Dress like others around you dress. Pretty common sense stuff.By the way, check out some of the other reviews. It's pretty unusual for any book, especially a one like this, to get all 5 star reviews. Look at the earliest 8 reviews. This is the only review that has been written by each of these 8 reviewers. All written on May 8. Almost all from San Francisco/California (interesting that the company founded by the authors is in San Francisco.) A bunch of people from San Francisco just happened to swarm to Amazon on May 8 to give the book a bunch of 5 star reviews. Interesting."
2,It's for college graduates getting their first corporate job,"I bought this book during a transition from the tech industry to finance. Also, I've been out of the standard corporate environment for a while and thought I might need a refresher on the goings on. Not! The book is quite elementary. I returned it the next day.It is well written and the authors target areas of importance for survival in a corporate office. However, this book is NOT for professionals! I repeat it is NOT for professionals! It is for the recent college graduate who has never stepped foot in a corporate office. Again, do not waste your time or money with this book if you already know how to handle yourself in a business work environment.If you're a brand new college grad and just received your FIRST job offer from a corporate firm, by all means grab this book and read it through before your first day."
2,Common Sense,"Starting a new job, you might not have time to read this book during your first 12 weeks. I felt that the book covers a lot of common sense information and lacked any sort of ground breaking secret to success information. If you lack people skills, this book could be beneficial to you."
3,Be Careful!!!,"This toy might not be suitible for kids under 2 because theyll get their fingers caught and they will be screamin!!!Also with children over 4""2 because you will have to bend over (atleast my long legged kids didthanxEliza"
3,not worth the money,"looked great, but didn't last a year with my 3 year old.spend your money on a stroller not a pram that comes apart.do your homework and save yourself a headache."
4,Very Nice,"Very nice product, purchased for a friend who was remodeling and looks great installed. Vendor was fine as well. I would buy again, friend loves them"
5,A wonderful story...,"This book is amazing, with a good story line and alot of action.If you like dragons, action filled fantasy, or any of the like, don't miss this book!You won't be able to put it down! I know I couldn't!! Have fun reading"
4,A Relaxing Listen,"What a wonderful collection of instrumental music. The instrument Mr. Armen plays is beautiful, and he truly makes it speak! This is a great album to play when you want some music, but don't want it to intrude. It still has wonderful energy to it (it was used on a video I own: ""Belly Dancing I: Beginning Instruction with Mara""), so while it relaxes you, it doesn't put you to sleep! Great for anyone who loves instrumental music."
4,A must read,"This book is a must read in todays changing times. Especially in the wake of Sept l1/01 and all its leading events.We have come tothe threshold of the Biokind Path experience Biokind in all levelsof our existence, inwardly and outwardly.Take this knowledge gleamed from this book and apply it to your life in todays ever changing world . Take our children by the hand of knowledge andlead them into Biokind."
5,a term for the times,"Biokind is a word that houses a concept that is central to the continuation of life on this planet.Captain Miller has encapsulated the thoughts and visions of naturalists, mystics and people of good will in a short, accessible form. ""The wilderness holds answers to questions man has not yet learned to ask."" Nancy Newhall, Biokind p45 and Biokind creates a terminology and a context that man needs to recognize the inter-relation of all life. In this time of fear, confusion and violence, Captain Miller's book provides a blueprint to shift our cultural conditioning from one of exclusion to one of inclusion. Study this book and begin to manifest true harmony."
3,Does it work?,I'm still trying to decide if it does work for fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis. Would be interested in others' opinions.
1,Too slow moving!,I could not get into this slow moving music. There was something missing - not enough of the rhythmic percussive beat which is so needed to get this cd going.
1,Dissappointing,"So far I have enjoyed all of Joanne Fluke's previous books until now. While this still had the typical coffee drinking, cookie baking, small town feel that I love I thought the mystery was annoying and as it turns out it couldn't possibly match the title of the book, once you read it you'll know what I mean.I found the pacing scene at the hospital so utterly ridiculous and unrealistic I could barely read about it, these are supposed to be real people(characters) after all..Plus the story was too short, I love the cookie recipes but I like a few in the middle of the story as Hannah is making them.I think Mike's a jerk and have grown tired of his role in this series. Choose Norman and be done with it!"
3,SO-SO,I enjoy Joanne Fluke's books but this one was not up to her usual standards. it even got boring at times. Too predictable.
1,Cheated,"I felt extremely cheated. I thought I bought a Novel, instead it turned out to be a short story with a cookbook attached. I wish the cover would have said something to the fact. It's cool to get a few recepies, but this book should be sold under the title cookbook not fiction. (The story was not even half the book)!"
2,Love the Series - Disappointed in this One,"I'm a fan of the Hannah Swensen murder series. However this isn't really an entry in that series. It's a cook book with a Hannah Swensen short story pasted on the front. It is also not the kind of cook book I'd choose to buy. The recipes are all canned soup, V8 and jello mold type recipes - the kind you could cut out of the cheaper women's magazines, laden with sugar and sodium and pre-packaged cheap ingredients. Contrasted with the cookie recipes in the other books, which are made from scratch, these were unwelcome filler taking the place of a real Hannah Swensen story. I say skip this one and enjoy the rest of the series."
3,CD verison,"This was the first book I have listened to by this author. While the mystery was o.k., I didn't think it took top billing over the recipes and mention of food. Honestly, don't read this book if you are hungry. I would suggest people read some other book from this series first, one that doesn't revolve around a holiday theme."
1,Don't waste your time unless you want a cookbook!,I am a mystery buff and this is first I have read by this author. The plot is risible. There is no mystery here - this is just an excuse to print recipes. I do not intend to read any more in this series so I will not find out if Winthrop Harrington II is a real British Lord or not but I can tell you right now that anyone with a II after his name is not British. So Winthrop hasn't done his homework! Oh - maybe that's the point but .... good grief! Very poor. PS I'm British!
2,Very Disappointing,"I have loved all of the other Hannah Swensen books in this series and was excited to get this one. The story is short, and half the book is recipes that I will never cook. I found the story to be contrived - how convenient for the killer to confess!!! The least believable part had Andrea giving birth all by herself (except for the doctor and nurse), while her friends and family, including her husband, paced up and down the hall outside the delivery room. Has the author ever been in a modern day hospital? Fathers are no longer banished to a ""father's waiting room""; they usually participate actively in the delivery room. I've loved all of the other stories in this series, so I will definitely buy the next one and just hope that this book is a ""Fluke""."
2,I wanted a mystery novel not a cookbook.,"The Hannah Swensen books started off so well, now they are just annoying. Hannah is overbearing, over-critical and plain not likable anymore. This book was sold as a mystery novel when in reality it was a second rate cook book."
1,Very Disappointing,"I've read all the books in the Hannah Swensen series, and this one is a huge disappointment. Look, I LOVE to cook. But I do not read these books for the recipes. I like the fact that she included the cookie recipes in past books, but come on! Over half this book is recipes! I was shocked when the story ended on pg. 168. (The book has 341 pgs.) And the plot just didn't work. It was all so contrived, and Hannah was annoying. I would not recommend this one at all. I'd give it zero stars, but the system won't let me!"
2,Sugar Cookie Overbaked,"Joanne Fluke has had a few good books, but this was not her best. Typical sparks fly between Hannah, Mike, Norman and Shawna Lee, but nothing to stay up for. Book was deceiving....lots of recipe's at the end made the book appear larger. I will continue to read Fluke books, but will not waste my good money on a purchase. Sorry Joanne, better luck next time."
2,Skip the recipes,"The story was fine, but the recipes were nothing great. I would not want to make any of them. Most use jar pasta sauce, and campbell's soups. Peach Jell-O, pears, mayonnaise, and paprika. Who would ever think that would be good together? Lime Jell-O with avocado and mayonnaise? Gross. Stick to bakery items."
1,Waste of time unless the recipes are better than the fiction.,"Shallow, predictable, dull, annoying. Pretty sure this wasn't written for adults, except most adolescents novels don't have a prostitute or recipes. I am a Minnesotan and the book rung every cliche Minnesota bell in existence."
3,mostly recipies,"i have read all the books until this one and this onw was by far thw worst. i already bught te next one ad i is way better, the only part that kept me on edge was if her pregnant sister was going to pop."
2,At least the recipes are still good,"Warning: it looks like a regular sized paperback, but it's not, because the entire second half of the book is recipes. The story itself is only about 200 pages, and that really weakens it. It's too short, too pat, and - like an 80s sitcom - wraps up far too nicely. Even though it falls into the series, you could probably give it a miss quite easily. Of all of her books, I was very disappointed with this one! I'll still read the next in the series (heck, I'm hooked, I'll admit it) but this one isn't one I'd put on the recommended list."
1,chris,"I have read others in this series, and I don't know why I bother. They all seem a lot the same, the characters are flat and dimensionless, with no growth taking place. This book in particular, there was very little mystery and the ending was stupid. While I enjoy a ""cozy"" mystery, I would like a little bit of realism, and the way the police department handled the whole situations was too ridiculous for words. I am also getting tired of the whole Norman vs. Mike storyline. Pick one and be done with it. I have enjoyed the cookie recipies from her books in the past, so in the future, I may just skip the story, and get the recipies."
2,So many things wrong,"I just finished reading this book and found it really annoying. First, Hannah is jealous of Mike and Shawna when she leads him and her other ""boyfriend"" Norman around like puppies on leashes. Second and worse by far, is the pomposity of this woman. She bakes cookies for a living yet throughout the book she's correcting peoples choice of words and lecturing. I mean she might have a brain and maybe in a small town like Lake Eden the cookie baker could be the resident genius but after a while it just gets really annoying. Third, the pacing at the hospital. Andrea's husband Bill is ""worried"" about his wife but stays in the waiting room pacing with the rest of the town. What planet is Lake Eden on. Fourth, half the book is recipes. I like recipes. I didn't like most of these. I like to read mystery series in order so I will most like continue reading these, though for the first time I'm reading books where the only character I don't like is the main character."
1,Over-rated and Underwritten,"I have tried desperately to like the Hannah Swenson books, but each and every one has fallen flat, with this being the worst offender. There was virutally no mystery, and half of the book was recipes. If I wanted a recipe for Minnesota Hotdish, I'd google it. Seriously. The characters, including Hannah herself, are shallow and underdeveloped, and the ridiculous ""love triangle"" is worn out. Are we really supposed to believe that two eligible men would fight over this 30-something prude with no personality? The dialogue is terrible, the plot thin, and the characters are unlikable. I hope that Joanne Fluke will tighten this series up, give Hannah a backbone, and jettison the more ""losery"" of the two suitors, but I'm not holding my breath. In my opinion, Diane Mott Davidson's Goldy Schulz mysteries are much, much better, and I'll be returning to that series instead of the Hannah Swenson mysteries."
3,More Like A Cookbook With A Plot...,"I was given this book for Christmas by a cousin who knows I like to read and also collect cookbooks: two birds with one stone. The mystery is a little light (which is fine) and can be read in about as long as it takes to watch a movie of the week. In fact, this book with its snowbound residents of a northern town, rather reminded me of a movie of the week. As for the recipes, I haven't made any but the caviar pie sounds somehow disturbing. The concept of recipes linked to a story that uses them in its plot is colorful and a good idea. Overall this book was neither spectacular nor a let-down, and deserves three stars, or about a C+."
1,"Lame, Lame, Lame!!!!!","Pleae do not waste your time reading, or buying this book. I have read many of Ms. Flukes books, and this one has to be the most boring book I have ever read!!!! I think Ms. Fluke needs to find another character to write about, or maybe another type of style."
5,happyreader,"Since I finished this book, I have filed it with my cookbooks! It is loaded with not only Joanne Fluke's usual delicious cookie recipes, but lots of main dishes, veggies, and appetizers as well. A great cozy read and delicious ""keeper"" recipes as well."
2,Huge Disappointment,"I've enjoyed Fluke's other baking mysteries but this one wasn't much of a mystery--but may be a good cookbook, I've not tried any of the 174 pages of recipes yet.Fluke fell into the most hated of all mystery novelists' sins--she didn't give you the clues in advance, just let them ""pop up"" when it was time for the exposition and announcement of the killer. I've read 5 of her other mysteries so I was pretty well versed in the characters that are standard in her novels. However, if you pick this up as a first read, you'll have no idea about the dynamics of the family or the town (or the love triangle which, by the way, is getting pretty old--Hannah just needs to make up her mind and go with it) because they are given no depth at all in this book but are nothing more than one-dimensional cut-outs used to decorate what is obviously a holiday cookbook.Don't waste your time or money on this one."
3,Enough already,"The first one or two of these books was light and fun, and I'll admit, the recipes are a nice addition. But after reading three or four books, it's hard to tell the difference. Other than changing the names, or the locations, the plot is much the same, and as many reviewers have stated, Hannah needs to grow up. The wishy-washy act has grown tiresome over the years. Try one book perhaps - then visit the local library before adding to a collection."
3,Info is out of date,"The Feingold Cookbook is a good one but the information about the Feingold Program is out of date. For more up to date info about the diet one should read Why Won't My Child Behave? by Jane Hersey, National Director of the Feingold Association, support group."
2,Care for a Spot of Tea?,"This book is fun, but more than a bit pretentious. To be passionate about a sport is one thing, but delusions of expertise suggest a rather pervasive sense of inferiority. Fishing is fishing. If you enjoy, so be it. Worry not what others think. Those who fish with worms are no worse or better than those who fish with caddis flies. The idea is to enjoy the outdoors. I love to flyfish. That is all that matters!"
2,I agree with Where's the beef,If you are looking for detailed examples or sample programs this isn't the book for you... Go with Mindy's book
4,Good book for beginners!,"It is too big, heavy and bulky... may use it as pillow.. This one is gud for beginners only not for experienced one! delivery and packaging was on time and proper as said by the seller..Thanks"
3,F&S Fans Beware,"Just a word of warning... ""French and Saunders: The Video"" is a Canadian release that is identical in content to ""French and Saunders: The Ingenue Years""... so of course, it is brilliant, but not worth purchasing if you already have the other video..."
2,"Lots of topics, but very sarcastic, negative and outdated.","This book is great if you need quotes on obscure topics (like grumbling). However, most of the quotes are sarcastic and have negative overtones. Very conservitive on its views of women, religion, etc. I wouldn't want my daughter using this book as a reference on being a woman."
5,Great resource,"When I am speaking, it is nice to have accurate quotes and sources rather than relying on memories. Sometimes the quotes are new to me but certainly not original concepts. The idea that some of the concepts have been around for a while also adds validity to what I am speaking about."
1,A Book of Bumper Stickers,Most of the Quotes in this book can be found on bumper stickers. A most helpful book if you are preparing to speak to 3rd graders.
3,"Come On People, It's not THAT Bad ...","After reading the negative reviews on this site, I'm almost ashamed to say that I have found this book to be helpful in the past. The quips and quotes about church and Christianity were cute, and most of the quotes had more substance and meat than other quote books. I haven't noticed the overt sexism toward women that others have mentioned, although it should be stressed that every quote book is going to have its share of dumb and trifling remarks. Use with caution.Rev. Marc Axelrod"
4,Perfect fit in a Cuisinart,"Great fit, and good quality. But like every mesh filter I've used, this one lets a little fine coffee sediment through (hence only 4 stars instead of 5). To prevent this, I also use a paper filter under the mesh filter. This double-filter method works great -- no sediment at all gets through."
1,Don't believe the other reviews,"This book consists primarily of motivational ideas that are much better presented elsewhere. If you want sales motivation--success check out Brian Tracy. The sales ideas are weak and not original. For good sales information see Spin Selling, Question Based Selling, or Brian Tracy on Selling. If you've never read a book on sales or success you might like this one, but having read piles of books on sales and related subjects I say this is one of the worst. There are no original thoughts here!"
1,Little Red Book,"In a word, wretched. Maybe if you've never been in sales and you're looking to become a car salesperson, this book is for you. But I suspect that if you're itching to sell cars, you won't need any of the wisdom contained in this book."
4,Click Add to Cart,"I read his first red book and now the second. Not everything applies to me as a sales person, but every idea helps cultvate my personal brand. It's a desk reference tool. It's worth the money...no questions asked."
5,Gittomer Rocks!!!!,I can not say enough good things about Jeffory Gittomer's books. Everything he writes is awesome and can be used immediatly to help your earning potential.
4,Pretty good,"This book is pretty good and contains some good insight. Some of the suggestions may be a bit over the top, but others have real value. It's a great read for a salesperson."
4,Gittomer,"Gittomer does it again with an entertaining, hard hitting look at sales. Not everyone's cup of tea but he does have some excellent observations and points."
4,Sales tool,Excellent book which is full of sales tips and is a fast read. I Would certainly recommend this book for anyone involved in sales?
5,I'm sold!,it makes you want to keep reading from page one. i didn't know what to expect when my job recommended it. They were right on the money. i will read it over and over again...
3,"The first ""Red"" book is the one to buy!","Don't get me wrong, I really think Gitomer is a great writer and speaker but this book just rehashes topics he has already covered in his two best sales books, the Little Red Book of Sales and The Sales Bible.I love his ""easy to read/no BS "" style. Unfortunately for the reader there is nothing new here. Purchase the two aforementioned books and study those.I agree with another reviewer that each book he comes out with is not as potent as his first books. But I don't blame him for writing these rehashed versions of his most popular books... He is making lots of $$$!As a side note... I have been in executive management for many years, earned my MBA, have purchased numerous books on business and have been to many leadership, sales and management seminars. But I still fall back on Gitomer's books for reference and motivation."
5,Excellent Advice,"I cannot put this book down. It is packed with helpful advice on everything to do with selling and keeping those customers. My favorite tip is the fact you cannot truly sell a product you dont own or have tried.On an aesthetic point, the book fits so well in your hands, the paper is strong, it lays flat, and it even has a little red bookmark! You can tell this is a quality book from the cover, and you can prove its a quality book from the excellent advice contained within the cover."
5,All Hail Gitomer,"You honestly can't go wrong following Jeffery Gitomer's advice. This is one prolific author and speaker. I have followed his advice for years. His style is not just contemporary and casual, but even intimate - like he's one of your good friends who doesn't want to steer you wrong.The red book is among a series of must-haves for business people of all walks - Fortune 500 or bedroom freelancer. My only piece of advice, take action on what he recommends. Don't just think about how great his insight can be. This is an investment in your future. Will you blow your 20 bucks, or will you capitalize on it? Your choice.[...]"
2,Don't get the Gold edition,"The gold edition has more color, but less useful information. I got the Gold edition after seeing the paperback in the bookstore. I ordered the Gold edition thinking that it'd be nice to have a hardcover for $2 more...but then was completely disappointed when I saw what they'd done to the content. I'd used the book before, and the regular edition is much better. There's just more in it. I'd give the paperback four stars. I can't believe they took a good book and made it worse with packaging. It just doesn't make sense.I ended up returning the book and buying the paperback at the local store -- the book cost more, but I got the right one. Oh, and I lost postage on the return too. Don't fall for it."
2,For Users with Previous Photoshop Experience.,This might be the ideal book for a user with a good working knowledge of Photoshop in earlier versions. I am a beginner and was looking for a how to book to get me started and take me to a more advanced level. It is definitely not for beginners. I returned the book and am now looking for a replacement to help me get started with Photoshop.
3,"Photoshop catechism guide maybe, but not a bible.","This is a good book and covers a lot of the basics of Photoshop 5. If you are looking for a book that goes over all of the details of Photoshop 5, this might be the book for you. However, it doesn't really seem to be all that good at providing simple steps for completing cool images that Photoshop can do. I guess I when a book claims to be the Bible for a program, I expected a little more. Again, the book is very good, it just doesn't seem to be a Bible of information."
2,A bit below average,"This is just my personal opinion - It's a bit to too thick on account of ""fat paper"". It rambles and digresses. It redigests the owner's manual. I found the Peachpit press books more concise (and lighter). You might think portability wouldn't be an issue, but it is. No one wants to carry around a doorstop unless it has relevance. One might think that a book geared toward a graphic design application might have some design sense. One who thinks in such a way as it relates to this book would be disappointed, because the page design is hideous. Very cheap printing. Oh, and overpriced. That's also key. Not recommended."
2,Disappointment,Although this book tells a great deal about what you can do in photoshop it does not explain how to do it. I am a fan of the photoshop software but was greatly dissapointed in this book.
5,jazz journey,"Was having an intense day at work and my boss went to lunch and came back with this CD saying, ""This will take you to another place so kick back and enjoy""! Jazz therapy? Nah. But wait a second... My mind cleared and during the first track I found myself drifting away and into a place I can't describe. I don't know the jazz lingo world or how to review properly. However, each song told a story without words. I literally felt removed from the crazed office environment. When the fifth track ""Argument"" came on, it brought me back but it wasn't a bad thing. It made sense to me why I was given this gift. This guy (with other artists) made me feel energy and emotion. It's amazing, for real and I am going to order his other CD's. How old is this kid??? Looks young on the cover but his soul must be ancient."
3,"Nice CD, but.....",Seems to be now emulating Joe Sample somewhat in his style on this CD. I had watched him develop a unique style over the past decade during his schooling at the Stanford Jazz workshops and also here in the San Jose area. He seems to be wandering from his early years IMHO. Great talent though and one of the better pianists.
2,Unfortunate Truncation,"If, as another reviewer has mentioned, this version has been cut from an original 200 munite version, then this could explain why it comes across as just another shallow made-for-TV bio pic. Watching this current 2-hour version, one can only come to the conclusion that Onassis was interesting only because he was rich, because Maria Callas was his mistress, and because he married Jackie Kennedy. There was no real insight as to how he made his fortune, which would have been much more interesting than a film whose only focus was on Onassis' womanizing. Raul Julia has proven that he is a fine actor with good material (Kiss Of The Spider Woman comes immediately to mind), but he is undone here by a very unimaginative script. Jane Seymour is not bad, though there's nothing here that hints as to why she won an Emmy, and her lip-synching of Callas leaves much to be desired."
3,ONASSIS-Made for TV,"This is a very good overview of Onassis' controversial and legendary life. His accomplishments are incredible and watching this well-produced TV movie drama, you get alot of insight into his life. Jane Seymour gives an incredible performance as Maria Callas, which is a whole other story upon itself. Raul Julia also gives a great performance. It centers more on the relationship between Onassis and Callas, and unfortunately not enough about his own family, such as his daughter Christina. It could have been more picturesque and cinematography could've been much better. The time period was very glamourous, but this film doesn't capture that essence. It does however capture the dynamics between he and Callas. Overall it's good, but the quality could have been much better, because it's just a made-for-TV movie."
2,Good book-stupid ending,"The ending to this book is a dissapointment. Now, I am all for cliff-hangers, but this one is too open for an ending. It is annoying and I feal like I wasted 5 hours of my life reading this book. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
1,I can't begin to describe how wrong this author is!,"The author portrays women and teens as shallow people. He stereotypes on how concerned they are with their reputations and always being MOST popular in school. Julie, the fifteen year old- main character, is always upset about the way she looks, her status, and how she can seduce the exchange student. I hated the book and I don't recommend it to anyone! They should allow you to put in a -10 stars. It was awful!"
2,TV and VCR sound,The sound from the TV and VCR uses the small and not too good speakers. The sound is tinny and no way to adjust. Also no output jacks to feed it to another amp. The DVD sound can be fed to a home theater system and is very good. Why can't they also feed the TV/VCR sound???? The customer service is not good. Since I was fortunate enough to have bought it as a retailer that will accept returns with no hassle I probably will do just that.
4,Sibling Rivalry Simplified,This is a question and response book that is cleverly illustrated about sibling rivalry. This selections is part of the A First Look At...Book series. Pat Thomas offers simple and practical responses to the vast and complex range of emotions that siblings experience. She also recognizes the individual differences amongst sibilings and the love that parents have for all of their children.
4,Don't panic -- its in English,"I ordered this for my husband for Christmas. I don't know if this is the case for all of them, but we watched Casino Royale and discovered the menu is in a logographic language (Chinese or Japanese, maybe. I am ignorant on these matters.) It was not a setting on our DVD player. The menu was easy enough to navigate intuitively or based on the general format of menus on DVDs. Once we hit play the movie played perfectly -- in English (sigh of relief)."
1,TYPICAL CHINESE GARBAGE,"THEY JUST CAN'T GET IT RIGHT, ANYTHING PRODUCED IN CHINA IS JUNK, THAT GOES FOR POISONOUS DOG FOOD, BABY FORMULA, POISONOUS TOYS, STANDS TO REASON THEIR EXPORT BOOTLEG DVD SETS WOULDN'T BE ANY GOOD EITHER.MY STEPFATHER PURCHASED A CAMERA, AND A BUNCH OF DVDS ON A TRIP TO CHINA LAST YEAR, CAMERA PACKED UP DVDS WOULDN'T PLAY. DON'T MEAN TO SOUND PREJUDICE BUT BUY AMERICAN, WE MAKE GOOD PRODUCTS."
3,Real or Not???,"They mostly work, whatever copied a couple of these really eat the write wring up on a couple and the movie skip's a little. I guess it's true, you get what you pay for."
3,Not wholly stimulating,"3 1/2Many interesting band dynamics offering up inspiring pockets of sound are found, but at least half the tracks display bouts of unimportant noodling, quelling A-V's involving momentum."
2,Poor construction,"This desk broke the first day it was in my house! The drawer is actually supposed to pull out (for a computer keyboard, presumably) -- the drawer face is supposed to rotate out 45 degrees to lay parallel to the drawer's bottom. Upon receiving the desk, however, I couldn't get the drawer to open -- until the whole desk face CAME OFF in my hand. Wouldn't purchase it again, or recommend it to anyone."
1,Carolina Cottage Bella Desk,"I returned this desk. It is made of very cheap material. It arrived with a split leg, cracked corner and broken drawer. It did not hold up well to the shipping - but it is fiberboard (or least it appears to be). I would not recommend this desk."
4,My First Leonard >>> ADDICTION,"This was my first Leonard novel. It was called, at the time, ""Ryan's rules"" (For Success in Armed Robbery). What fun it was to read. Too bad, I gave it away, though I would love to read it again. It is a MUST for any Elmore Leonard fan."
1,Not the best by a great writer of thillers,"This book seems quite dated and filled with cardboard characters. The two main crooks, for example, are impossible to tell apart--they have no separate personalities! There are much, much better books by Elmore Leonard."
4,Swag: A Novel,"Another very good, easy read from Mr. Leonard. The kind of book I like to read on a long flight."
5,Elmore's masterpiece,"Although it is hard to select Elmore's best work, for my money Swag is the one. Swag is funny, dramatic and tense at the same time. The humor is subtle, but is vintage Elmore. The tension carried thorughout the book is masterful. You really don't know until the final paragraph whether Ryan and Stick will get away or not. All in all, a tremendous book. I would recoomend Swag to any one who has not read any Elmore. Enjoy."
5,"All Elmore, all the time!","This is another in a long line of truly great books. I love Leonard's character, absolutely love the dialogue. This is another reason why, after I read my first novel in the 1980s, I walked into the nearest bookstore on payday and bought 15 books by him. I read them all before the next payday and went out looking for more. One of my favorite binges!!"
2,If you think Elmore Leonard is a good writer...,"...you will absolutely love Donald E. Westlake, (HE is the MASTER of the crime novel). Westlake also writes a ""comic"" crime series that feature a character named Dortmunder. I recommend the latter highly (start with ""Drowned Hopes"", you won't be disappointed. As for SWAG, the characters do stupid things, it's unbelievable, even for the seventies, and I just didn't care what happened to them."
3,Ho Hum,"Definitely not one of Leonard's more memorable tales. The main characters are a couple scumbags with no redeeming qualities, at least up to the halfway point of the book. More shall be revealed, I hope."
5,Swag,I have always enjoyed the criminals in Leonard's novels. This one has some of the funniest banter between the crooks.
5,Enjoyable read,"Love the lowlife conversation and predictable wrong thinking,the poor judgement of main characters.lives go steadily down until. No way out."
2,"Great Prose, Great Quotes, Rambling Content","William Hazlitt was no doubt a great writer, this small book contains six essays he wrote in the 1820s. While his prose makes for pleasant reading, I am a pragmatist and expect writing to lead to a purpose. I enjoy key learnings or to be delighted and entertained. This book delivered a few great quotes, one among them was ""Love turns, with a little indulgence, to indifference or disgust:Hatred alone is immortal"". The essays are a scattering of the authors thoughts about a boxing match, the monarchy, slavery,indian jugglers and cynicism about the world and his own writing. This book for me just discussed things I could care less about and at the end of reading it I thought what was the point of his writings. It seemed like a diary more than essays. I would skip reading this one book in the penguin great idea series, the others are excellent."
2,"I wear one, but have no idea if it works","I bought a Q-Link to see if it would help with the headaches I get from working in front of a screen all day. It didn't.It might be ""amplifying my biofield"" in other ways, but how would I know? Of course now I'm worried that if I remove it I will get sick or something, so I keep it on superstitiously. Sigh....A friend of mine put a Q-Link on a dying bonzai plant and it came back to full health, but who knows how much that was from the Q-Link.A curious product indeed."
5,Great Bit,"I bought the bit to drill holes in my Motorcycle baffle pipe (some sort of steel). I drilled about 50 different holes, with no decrease in performance. The bit stayed cool and sharp throughout the whole process. I did spray it with water while cutting each hole, so that probably helped it to stay cool and not wear as much."
4,Love it!,"This is a great little device! I use it at the gym, and hardly notice it's there (weight-wise!). The volume is more than loud enough to drown out the music at the gym. Here are my recommendations:* It's worth spending a little more to get the 128MB version.* Download the Explorer from the Samsung site for uploading new music, and your favorite MP3 producing software (such as MusicMatch Jukebox)."
4,Great Player,"It's a great little player, just go to samsungusa.com and download the Yepp Explorer software because the software that came with it is kinda wack, but great great sounds, and you can adjust the bitrate on your Explorer program to get more music out of the player however at a slighly lower fidelity rate, Amazon.com/J&R had a sale on this item which .../... the price shown so i really got a steal,"
2,Dont buy this player if you want to hear more than 12 songs!,"I bought this player from Frank1e on here and it came quickly,pkgd nicely, but this is NOT the MP3 player that iexpected. The software was irritating, but unless im doing something wrong..this 64mb will only hold about 12 songs..then thats it..you cant add anymore..so to me its useless..i could burn a CD with many more songs than that..I was super upset and very disappointed..thank god I just went ahead and bought the ""better than Ipod"" Creative Zen player..and it is AWESOME...this player works.its not hard to manipulate, it just sucks as far as how many songs it will hold. and the software isnt very user friendly. Save your money and for $150 get a good one!"
1,Go with an iPod instead,"My father made the mistake of purchasing this item and I sincerely wish he never had. The interface is not user firendly, the instructions are confusing, the manual was near to worthless and bang for buck it's a ... The controls are so tiny you have to pretty much have the hands of a hobbit to use it. About the only good things you can say about it is that it's very lightweight (especially compared with the iPod which is a little heavy) and that it records (if that's what you're looking for). Although I was able to figure out how to use it, I would certainly not recommend this to anyone for whom computers are in any way confusing. ..."
2,"Good harware, very bad software",The program locks after a small number of songs have been put into the database requiring an on-line upgrade at a cost. No where is this documented and it really bugs me.The program its self is a pain to use and for such a simple process makes it cumbersome.
3,"Good product, BAD software","I have had this MP3 player for nearly a year now, and I have had no problems with it, other than the software. Like other reviewers have said, the software is horrible. It's not compatible with ANYTHING and it's generally difficult and awkward to navigate. The player, however, is durable, sounds great, lightweight and easy to use."
3,Wish I had chosen something else,"If you have Windows XP, save youself some trouble and look elsewhere. I didn't have problems loading the software, but once loaded, it is difficult and clumsy. If you find it hard to load files, wait until you try to remove them. What was even more disappointing is the inability to add memory.On the up side, it looks great when you are at the gym. I am a runner and was sick of CDs skipping when I run or having to stop and change CDs. It's great for use while excerising if you can get the music loaded."
4,"If you like Pre GT Firms, then you will like this","First, I have to preface this by saying I do prefer the work done by the original Firm Producers than Good Times. I also like weight training that also works the cardiovascular system somewhat. So yes, I like this DVD. Its nice to have choices-as others have said, you can do one of 3 workouts and even though this is a ""parts"" tape, it flows very well. its a keep for me."
3,Um ... :-(,"Yes this is a disappointment. I don't especially love The Firm at the best of time, but I'm always after new workouts to keep things interesting and I'm sorry I have this. It is indeed The Firm's ""best ever"" toning exercises, re-edited from various 1993-1998 programs. So yes, you might already own this.The two workouts here alternate between upper and lower body routines. You will need dumbells, barbell and their fanny lifter (or put your step on high). It's about 82 minutes all up, but there's nothing totally new or interesting about this, and so I think I'll stick to almost anything else I own."
1,NO 3-IN-1-----MISLEADING ADVERTISING,"The DVD is a remix of old workouts but the exercises if done consistently will get you the results you want. However, the advertising is misleading in many ones---first, it is dishonest in my opinion in stating that you get 3 workouts when actually #1 and #3 are duplicates. Was this an oversight? And, the cover does make it seem modern but it is a rehash of stuff from the early 1990's. Prepare yourself---some of the makeup is very scary to see."
1,VERY disappointing,"I wish I had read all the reviews here before I purchased this DVD. VERY misleading in that is looks like a new workout with Allie, but is all outdated and cheesy looking! I am disappointed the FIRM would use such a sneaky tactic to sell OLD videos."
5,Beautiful,This tote exceeded my expectations in quality and looks. It is beautiful and so well made! Very sturdy yet lightweight. I was lucky enough to win it on ebay for $20 but would definitely pay alot more for it.
5,5 star book,HiI am an American Father living in Japan with a Japanese wife and a 3 year old daughter who is starting pre-school. I love this book as it helps me prepare great healthy food for my daughter mirei's lunch (bento) box.my wife really thinks I an cook now.I love this bookputnam
5,Japanese cooking at home!,"This book is full of delicious, Japanese style cooking, some of it is even served in Japanese restaurants! It's great that I can take that home with me to share!"
3,How to Book of Sacrementals: Everything You Need to Know but No One Ever Taught You,Everything is just a general description or definition and not much more. Everything but how to use Sacramentals to enhance your worship life. Too bad someone did teach me more and this was not nearly enough.
4,Usefull WIFI finder,"When you are in the street, you do not have to open your laptop to check WIFI. Sometimes you do not know if WIFI is public or not but at least it is something about. You can now choose where to take a coffe with wifi...."
1,Not the real thing,I ordered this and was disappointed when it arrived in flimsy packaging with scraped off security seals. The product did not smell or look the stuff I have been using for 4 years. I did a side-by-side comparison with my current bottle and it was clearly not the real thing. I contacted the seller and they said they would not give me a refund because I opened it. I was surprised that they did not stand by the product at all. I had to contact Amazon to get a refund. Will not order anything from them again!
5,This is a wonderful cream,"This is a great cream, I use it day and night with all the other Dermalogica Skin care line"
1,Sent wrong boot,We didn't receive the correct boots and had to purchase them locally. They did pick up the boots with no charge to us and said that they would credit our account. Mistakes happen...
4,Solid episodes,"Plenty of fighting in these episodes and the filler are mostly great in their own ways. The best part about this is that its all canon episodes and if they keep the same number of episodes per set it would appear that the non-canon arch will be contained on its own sets.I would greatly prefer if the price got closer to 20 bucks a set, but keeping non-canon episodes into their own sets would be my second want.This set is nothing but great Bleach, the two or maybe three sets that follow it though will be pretty painful."
4,bleach,I really like this show bleach however it has taking many years for the English versions to come out and each season gets shorter. not very happy about that. the price is pretty expensive . as for the show it is pretty great . I just don't understand why they have not released the complete English version I know that they are playing them on Cartoon Network . So I know for fact they have already been made .
3,deviate too much of the main story with other not interesting stories of heroes.,i didnot like the part in Karkura town and the friends of ichigo being heroes and given principal time in this disc.
4,Bleach Uncut Box Set 15,The DvD was transported without incident. It proved playable on our current DvD player and was very entertaining to view
4,A solid start,"This book will give you a good intro in to studying for the LSAT, and it includes four practice tests. It is a good resource, but you will probably want to supplement your studies with additional resources."
2,Better than Kaplan,I bought this after I threw out my Kaplan's comprehensive guide. This one was much better. The explanations and advice were helpful and easily understood. It deserves 4 stars. I put 2 stars by mistake
1,Absolutely dreadful,"The author had some interesting ideas, but the writing was so poor that I couldn't get through the book. This is a romance novel thinly disguised as fantasy - full of the most trite cliches. It doesn't belong in the sci fi/fantasy section. Stay away unless you want to read a romance novel"
1,Infernal Torture,"After finishing up my graduate work in literature, I looked forward to a nice piece of fiction to help me relax and unwind. The cover and teaser on the back of this book intrigued me, and I must say the premise and ideas contained in the text are interesting. The major flaws lie in the fact that this is NOT A FANTASY NOVEL. The author's history as a romance novelist is quite evident from the triteness of the characters to the stiff and unrealistic dialogue.The ideas are worth considering, yes, and the novel reads like a Hammer vampire film or a Bulwer-Lytton novel. It's a plane crash with a huge fire from which you cannot pull away. Do not expect Tolkein or Anthony; this is nowhere near the par of even the adventures created by a neophyte Dungeonmaster.Read at your soul's peril."
3,It could have been better.,"I like the beginning but I was disappointed in how the story went. It is easy to read a book that takes place in a different realm with fariys ect., but when you mix fariys ect. with reality it's a little hard to grasp."
1,unpleasant,"This book was unpleasant in the beginning and I stopped reading halfway once I figured it out: what was the point...? I worked at a bookstore at the time and read it on my breaks, and I am glad, so that I didn't waste money buying it..."
5,Webb's latest simply outstanding,"James Webb writes of the people who made him and the country what both are today; it is uncertain which derived the greater benefit: for Webb is the nation's true rennaissance man and America remains the ""city on the hill"" to the rest of the world. Mr. Webb's work is not just history; it is public policy. He debunks, for example, the myth of the privileged white class and thereby destroys the basis for the offense that is racial preference programs. Finally, Mr. Webb honors, not just his ancestors, but all the nation's true heroes; not the elite that ""serves"" from high office but the men and women who endure and, in doing so, rejoice. A must read for anyone who wishes to learn the nation's future by discovering its past."
3,"Seminal Work, but Biased","Webb does a good job of showing how important the Scots Irish were in shaping the character of America. I applaud him for that.However, what I did not like was his extreme nationalism in regards to the Scottish people. The Scots Irish were not exclusively Scottish; they only had about 50% of their genetic heritage from Scotland - the rest is a mix of Anglo-Saxon and Norse. This is important, because it helps describe why the Scots Irish, who lived in the Border Country between those two nations, felt themselves to be separate from either England or Scotland, and instead owed their allegiance to their family and clan. This attitude is then brought with them to America, where they have always had a great distrust of government.The Scots Irish are not Scottish, any more than they are English. They are a mix."
2,Could Have Been Much Better,"I had a hard time deciding how to rate this book. I enjoyed most of it; probably 70-80%. If the author had stuck to the history of the Scots-Irish people, the book would have been a winner in my mind. However, the author chose to discuss politics and activism and other subjects that I feel are much too subjective for this type of book. The author also apparently felt that the book was a good place to brag about his accomplishments, especially regarding his military history. I was also put off by the way he glorified acts such as violence and under-age drinking. I do feel that the author raised some good, though-provoking points. Its just too bad that he felt the need to add the unnecessary components that, for me, made this book much less enjoyable."
4,This book hit close to home,"I enjoyed the book tremendously, because my mother's family were Scots-Irish from Virginia, and I learned a lot about the history of this ethnic group. I also found out from Mr. Webb's book that he and I are fifth cousins. I wrote him an email and told him that we have a five times great-grandfather in common. Mr. Webb took the time to write me back and addressed me as ""Cousin."" He's a very accessible, friendly man and will make a great senator. The parts about the Vietnam war were not as relevant to me, but showed insight that I have never heard before."
5,Honor - Courage - Committment,"If only more people were as proud of their heritage !Sect Webb has written a book that's lucid, accurate, and thoroughly enjoyable. It's no surprise that with his dedication to ""Honor - Courage - Committment"" that the 'elite's' like Publishers Weekly hates his book - he espouses principles and concepts of sweat, toil, and hard work that these media weasels will never understand.There's more to being Irish than just St Patrick' Day, and this book helps describe the traditions and background that these brave people brought that made this country great. Well Done !"
5,This is a Fine Book. Bravo!,"I can't begin to describe how much I've enjoyed reading this book. First, the writing is eloquent and poetic. Second, Webb's arguments are logical and nonbiased. It is so refreshing to read a book that is not so politically slanted to the right or to the left. I would describe myself as a liberal, but I read Webb's work with an open mind because he presented his thesis in a manner that wasn't mean-spirited, judgmental or opinionated. Finally, my maternal grandfather Ramey was from Bristol, Virginia, and I can see so many of the characteristics of the Scotch-Irish influence in what I know of his life and in my family today in Indiana. I will never think of Appalachian people in the same way again. The only negative is that I have only three pages left to read of the book. Bravo, James Webb, for telling the story of our great Scotch-Irish heritage!"
2,Revisionist history,"Webb took an interesting idea and topic, but quickly turned it into a biased, prejudicial rant. Most notably, he insists the southern ""cracker"" was not at all responsible for segregation, nor for the woes the negro experienced because of it. Insisting the poor white trash were mere dupes of the moneyed class, Webb is, thereby, able to overlook the head-cracking, water-hose wielding, church-bombing experiences of the 60's, plus all of the abuses and losses of dignity until then. A real disappointment."
5,Humble Pride,"As i'm a Scots-Irish man to the tee, I now understand more about my personal roots.I now know why I my temperment is so intense.I also can acknowledge that ""history"" is not always as self- evident as the revisionsts in our ""education system"" make it. The incentive to fight for vast majority of the Confederate soldiers had as much to do with slavery as they were involved with this abhorrent practice: none. It was pride."
2,i stopped reading when I read ...,"I stopped reading on p.260, in the chapter that mentions the Scopes Monkey Trial, when I arrived at this shocking statement: ""... the theory of evolution as presented by the Darwinists still rests on scientific speculation that has yet to be proven.""This bold-faced lie called into question everything I'd read in the previous 259 pages, and I threw the book aside. Truth to tell, it had seemed a bit overblown until that point. I'm of Scots-Irish heritage myself, but parts of the book verge on narrow-minded ethnicentrism ... if Webb had his way, the Scots-Irish are responsible for all the best parts of the American character, and none of the worst, except for lovable faults, like drinking too much, singing, and generally carrying on.Check the footnotes for a laugh ... Webb makes so many references to his own novels, he's like the fictive character of Stephen Colbert, forever plugging his own work."
2,"Kind of a Strange Book, Part History, Part Author's Bio","Webb's book has its moments, especially in the first parts when he is outlining Scots Irish history. It was enjoyable and informative. Then, the book changes into some sort of a personal biography of the author and his ancestors. Definitely less interesting. Webb also demonstrates that annoying habit many of us Southerners have of somehow blaming everybody else for life's ills, especially the Civil War. Two stars, but no more."
4,"Refreshing look at the people our ""Elite"" hate.","I am not done reading this book and will update this review when I am finished, but so far, it is a refreshing look the people and culture that America's elite openly hate: the rural scots-irish. They have no problem relying on these people for the bulk of the wars we have fought (Kentucky and Tenn have casualty rates five times higher than New York City), but openly loathe their culture - from country music to the near-sacred right to gun ownership.Webb's book is a noble attempt to address these wrongs, and show the often overlook influence of these people - who's culture is so much a part of the american fabric that they are nearly invisiable.My only ""complaint"" thus far is Webb's insistence on their Celtic idenity, when in fact much of the Lowlands of Scotland (where they originally came) were in fact an english speaking mixture of Angles, Saxons, Danes and Celts."
4,A Time To Fight,A must read for anyone who has an interest in our current world problems as well as current economic issues we are facing
2,Self-Promoting Campaign Ad,"The subject covered by Senator Webb is the contributions made by the Scots-Irish immigrants during and after the 18th century. The Senator's family was included in this group as was mine but his two-chapter ego stroke certainly takes away from the historical facts presented. In fact, his behavior as a legislator belies the very qualities he so admires in his ancestors. I'm sure they're rolling over in their collective graves at this very moment. I'd give it a 5-star for the historical info but a minus 1-star for his sleazy and transparent attempt to incorporate his politics into the history of one of the ethnic groups that contributed so much to this way of life."
2,What a crock,Webb's thesis interested me but his apology for resistance to Civil Rights movement to the resistance to Reconstruction are hogwash. Racism is racism. I am Scot- Irish and I was offended by this book.
5,A classic about the Scots Irish in the US,"I read this book a couple of times over the past few years and it explains a lot of contemporary history. This is lighter reading than other books on the same general topic, but full of insights and research. It is extra fun if your ancestry is Scots-Irish - you can identify with so much of it."
3,Splendid polemics,"I am a Scots Irish who lives in the UK.I found this to be a splendid book,but probably for reasons which differ from those of Scots Irish Americans.The Scots history part is probably broadly correct in its general conclusions,but is mistaken in a lot of detail,and needs some sub-editing.Braveheart was a minor detail compared with the relentless harrying of Scotland by England over 400 years,harrying which left it the poorest country in Europe.The Ochil hills are not in Ayrshire.And so on.The Irish history is fascinating,however,and is excellent,although more social history would have been welcome.For me,the book excelled in its American chapters,although American readers may find some of his conclusions irritating,and he glosses over some acts of wickedness. What it explained to me was,why the U.S.A. re-elected Bush,and just why so many Americans found his Boston rival unacceptable.As a primer of modern American politics,it is superb."
5,Our Classroom: Together we can learn,This book gives great ideas on how to bring unity into the classroom
2,Lightweight & flimsy,"I guess these would be OK to take on a picnic or a packed lunch, but they are just too light for me to feel comfortable using them every day at home. The plastic is much lighter than the stainless, thus they feel 'unbalanced' and insubstantial. I wanted flatware that's not ""flat,"" but this, although cute looking, just doesn't fit the bill. This has put me off any flatware with plastic handles. You get what you pay for."
1,Not very good at ALL!,"After a few months use the forks, spoons, and knifes got REALLY dull, rust starting appearing and they started falling apart. I had to replace them with good quality SOLID metal ones. :("
3,Got what I paid for,"I got these because they were inexpensive and didn't have the uncomfortable sharp edges that the inexpensive metal sets had, and because the colorful aspect was appealing. They're mostly usable, but they have some unfortunate flaws. The worst thing I've found is that the (hollow) plastic portion gets liquid trapped inside it, so you have to be careful when washing the pieces so that you don't wind up flavoring foods with soap. For the same reason, the teaspoons are not appropriate for use in tea or coffee. Also, as another reviewer noted, none of the utensils feel well-balanced. I've had the set for a little over three years now; it does show small spots of rust, particularly around the base of the knife blades, but for the most part it's held up reasonably well. If I were buying a new set, I wouldn't buy this one again--I'd go for metal."
3,Material flaw!,"I bought this flatware set because it had vibrant colors and would match my dinnerware set. Also I would know instantly if I threw away the flatware by mistake when clearing away the dishes. It is easy to see which spoons or forks were missing instantly by looking at the hanging rack that comes with it. Unfortunately, the silver ball on the end of the flatware is made of plastic and with little use cracked and came off easily. The silver ball on the tip had to be made of metal and secured much better so it wouldn't have cracks. Now I have to prop it up on the rack instead of have it hanging with the rest of the flatware from the set. Otherwise it is comfortable to use, grips easily in your hand. Just wished they would have used better material it doesn't last long, good idea just not quality product."
3,Cambridge Silversmiths Carnival Flatware,"Not too happy with the bad packaging of this product. The little silver pearls on the end come off too easily. I had five rolling around loose in the plastic container. The flatware is hanging on a silver metal frame, that I thought added to the chance for damage instead of preventing it as the items are hard to get off the frame.I didn't bother returning this, I just jammed the pearls back in place. I know to be careful in handling, but they will do for everyday eating. You wouldn't want these for a formal setting anyway."
2,Cute but doesn't last,"I loved the look of these when I first bought them, so I bought enough for 12, thinking to use them for everyday, and especially for eating on the patio. Lively colors, cute hangers. However, after a year the plastic balls on the ends began cracking apart and falling off. Also, the handles would bend if the dishwasher drying setting was on. Now I have at most three settings left that look and function acceptably. I'm shopping for something else now. I would only recommend buying these if you expect to replace them in a year or less."
3,Did Jason really die in this one?,"Jason dies for the first time in the series, but the producers said this would be the last of the Jason movies, and Jason would finally die."
2,It's okay...I guess...,"Fairly boring, and by now following a strict formula, Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter just features more gory death and exposed breasts. Also featured are Corey Feldman as the boy who finally ""kills"" Jason and Crispin Glover as another horny teen. For a Friday the 13th, it's not bad, and it has no really horrible qualities, but it's not that great either. END"
3,"It was the Final Chapter, but not the Final Friday","I rented like 5 Jason movies from the video store cause I didnt see them, when I watched this one Im like a kid is gonna kill Jason, Im like I cant wait till the end.In the movie when jason killed peaple they didnt show him, they only showed his feet, but toward the end they started to show him, they were couple cheesy parts to this movie but the plot and setting was good."
2,HERE WE GO AGAIN,"IN THIS ONE, JASON AWAKES IN THE COUNTY MORGUE, AND HE CONTINUES HIS VIOLENT KILLING SPREE AT CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE. THIS SEQUEL SHOULD'VE BEEN THE LAST ONE, BUT, KNOWING THIS WAS JUST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT DIDN'T END HERE. OF INTEREST ONLY FOR A YOUNG COREY FELDMAN, OTHERWISE, IT'S JUST YOUR AVERAGE HORROR SEQUEL."
4,The final chapter? I dont think so!,"When I saw this movie I knew it wouldn't be the last one, BecuaseJason has just got the hockey mask! part one, two, and three he had no mask so you couldn't see his face. Now this maniac isn'tjust gonna die after his face is covered right? Simular to Michael Myers. But then they both have different plots, Jasonkills his way through Camp Crystal Lake to kill a certain person...Its a hell of agood movie. Halloween fans you might find it interesting as wellas I did. For gore fans,sex fans your lucky becuase there is plenty of it!"
3,MORE JASON MAYHEM 2 1/2 STARS!,"I am writing reviews for each of the Friday the 13th, but I own the box set and the older releases of the later two. The reviews are for those editions not the newer deluxe editions.With a bigger budget, this ""Friday"" installment has a better cast and FX. This film also marks the first time we get a good look at the adult Jason without his mask! The ending is memorable in this one, but the title is misleading.....the final chapter?....I think not!The DVD transfer is very good and there are some cool extras on the box set."
2,This should've indeed been the final chapter,"By this point, There was really no reason to keep on continuing this series. After all, This isn't The Godfather we're talking about here! Jason returns yet again, Only this time, More sex-starved teens come to Crystal Lake only to each have their own terrifying encounters with Jason. I'ma put it to ya plain and simple: The Tommy Jarvis character [Played well by Corey Feldman] and the innovative make-up work by Tom Savini really help to save this movie from being nothing more than another collection of murders and sex scenes. The Tommy Jarvis character was actually the most complex character the Friday series ever had [That's actually saying something]. Had this been the true ending of the Friday series, This series would actually be a lot better off. Another film strictly for die-hard fans of the series."
1,"The ""Classic""","this is the worst FT13TH movie yet. weaker characters, and wak plot. Oh well. GET THE MUCH BETTER FIRST ONE."
1,Boring and not enough killing,This movie is slow-paced and boring.The focus is on teenagers trying to get laid in the woods. There was not enough of Jason Vorhees and his killing spree. Wait 'till Jason vs. Freddy Part II if you want to see some real Jason violence. This was worse than Bride of Chuckie. If that's even possible.
1,BORING!,"Obviously I didn't like the movie,but the film is pritty dull and the plotline is very empty. It makes you just want to fast forward to the death scenes(it's that bad!)Although I did think the ending was ""cool"". Only for serious fans of the Friday the 13th movies!"
2,Jason should have slipped on a banana peel and broke his neck.,"This is meant to be a ""Horror movie""? It's more like a Comedy instead.Another campy crappy ""Friday The 13th"" film.The only films in the series that I'll give credit to,is the original...and of course to ""Jason Takes Manhattan"",but only because of the eye-candy who is Jensen Daggett.Anyway,as I said.This movie is more of a Comedy.You get some chubby girl,who gets stabbed in the back of the neck,while EATING a banana.Hmmmm....sounds a bit stereo-typical to me.A CHUBBY girl getting killed,while eating.Why couldn't it have been one of the skinny hot chicks who get killed in this fashion while eating? Let's not forget the silly dance of Crispin Glover.I wonder how much crack he was snorting,when they filmed this movie.Most of this film is just a bunch of laugable nonsense.Karma should have came back around to Jason,thus him facing the wrath of THE BANANA!"
3,Feldman you suck! I wanted to kill Jason! Go be a vampire again. That's what you're good at!,"I can't believe Corey Feldman kills our lovable hockeymask wearing psycho! Oh well, atleast this one's better than Part 3. I think Ted White was a descent Jason and i can't understand why he personally hates the series. Is it just me or does Jason seem kind of smart in this one? I mean he was an eleven year-old menatally cahllenged kid when he died. What's the odds he'll know how to remove a breaker box or wait patiently outside of a window for someone to get close enough for a kill?"
3,the lost boy kid,"the kid from the lost boys is in this one.finaly,a familiar face!after this one there was a psyche hospital and then a sherriffs daughter.its better than a lot of the other parts.the scene where jason gets it is dragged out.i mean they hit him with everything and then some.the kid finaly has him down and out and grabs an axe.he hacks away like mad screaming did die die die die die die die the whole time.it was the best part.possibly the all time coolest friday the i3th moment.in case you care i liked it way better than the lost boys."
3,ONE OF THE BEST IN THE SERIES,"IF YOU HAVE READ MY OTHER REVIEWS OF THIS SERIES, YOU WILL HAVE NOTICED THAT I ALWAYS CALL THIS SERIES CORNY AND FUN, THIS ONE IN THE SERIES IS DIFFERENT THOUGH. FULL OF ALL STAR ACTORS, SOME SCARY MOMENTS, AND A NOT TO SHABBY PLOT, THIS FILM IS GOOD FUN AND STANDS OUT FROM OTHERS IN THE SERIES."
1,Ridiculous cheese. Some people are so easily entertained,"Never mind that the first 3 movies and this are identical, the fans flock to it all the same. The whole series is mindless stupidity at its finest."
1,the final chapter-it better be,Steve miner steps down and reflects on his jobs on part 2 & 3 and says im done with these friday films theyre rubbish!.this isnot as well done at all as the origanal i see not really any difference between any of the sequences so far not a real change in the story line or any decent death scenes just basic repeats.When we see the new chapter start we all best be in for something decent and maybe we should get halloween director john carpenter to have a go hed liven up the poorley made friday 13ths
4,Jason finally meets his match!,"This was one of my favroite Friday the 13th movies.Jason is at his best and scarriest in this installment,i could not sleep for a week. This movie is worth every penny of my money,even if your not a friday fan you will still enjoy this movie. BUY THIS MOVIE!"
4,Jason sure gets what's coming to him!,"This is my other favorite Friday the 13th, a dark and somber looking entry that was meant to be The Final Chapter in the series. It wasn't, it just made too much money for the studio to ignore.Picking up right at the ending of Part 3 with a fairly atmospheric crime scene clean up, during which Jason's 'corpse' is collected and taken to the Crystal Lake morgue. Shortly after being put on ice, the serial killer reawakens and begins his slaughter spree yet again. Luckily ANOTHER group of teens that have not been watching the news or listening to the radio (and thus unaware of the twenty plus dead bodies recently found cluttering up the lake area) show up to be killed off one by one in inventive ways. Same thing, different number.As I mentioned earlier this entry has a dark and somber 'final' tone to it and actually it holds up well in repeat viewings, if you are a fan of this kind of silliness. Recommended to those who are."
2,Is Jason still alive?,"This movie failed to both shock me or suprise me. It was watchable though but it just doesn't feel like one of the FRIDAY movies. I think as more sequels appear, the real camp crystal lake murders fade into the background. They keep saying that the location of this movie is Camp Crystal Lake but it looks nothing like it. It would be cool if there were some of the original features. If I were you just stick with the first 2 movies."
3,Good for what it is.,"Though pretty much the same as the first three Friday the 13th films and even containing the same ideas (teenagers at lakeside are butchered, body is thrown through window, boring 'romance' scenes), this rather misleadingly-titled entry into the series has a much darker and more sinister atmosphere. The direction is first-rate and there are some genuine shocks, Jason Voorhees at his most terrifying. The film is also helped by the presence of some new characters - a 12-year old horror enthusiast, a forester out to find Jason and avenge the death of his sister).It's just a pity more of a plot couldn't have been inserted."
2,Damn my eye,"Jason's back and once again, he hunts down more teens on vacation. Gets off to a wretched start but gets progressively better. A nice ending that one would only think is a prelude to another sequel."
3,Not nearly as scary as the first one...,"Okay. Usually gore doesn't really bother me unless it gets REALLY nasty - and this one over did it a little bit. Near the beginning where Nurse Morgan gets gutted with the scalpel is absolutely disgusting. It just bothers me and I don't know why. This one is scary, but the gore is overdone and it just gets becomes stupid after a while b/c of it."
4,GOOD BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE EIGHTH ONE,I LIKED THIS ONE BUT JASON TAKES MANHATTAN WILL ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE MOVIE.THIS ONE HAD GOOD SCARES! I WAS REALLY FREAKED OUT.COREY FELDMAN WENT CRAZY AT THE END! THIS ONE HAD MORE SEX AND VIOLENCE THEN THE REST.THAT'S GOOD.GET THIS MOVIE
3,Not as bad as the rest.... but still not great,"The definite high-point of the series, Friday the 13th Part 4 suffers from the same lame old plot as the rest of the films but definitly has enough scares to it to qualify as a good horror film. Tom Savini, who provided the effects in the first flick, returns to provide us with the typical gore and really steals the show with some of the most gruesome dispatchings of bad actors I have ever seen. Young Corey Feldman provides some laughibly stupid lines and Kimberly Beck (who was in the 1976 cult film Massacre At Central High)does the best she can with her role as Trish, the young girl who must face off against the masked killer at the end. The film does reach some high points of excitment near the end as has some genuine scares scattered throughout but it really doesn't elevate the genre or give us anything new. Watch it for some good screams and excellent effects... just don't think you're getting anything new."
3,Rest in Peace Jason,"Alot better movie. The actors were well picked for this one. Good special make-up effects, Tom!"
5,Great Friday night fun!,"""Usually sequels are a poor version of the original, but not in this case. This movie provides everything you want in a horror movie. The body count is particularly high, the 'B' grade sex scenes are also there. The dialogue is particularly lame, which adds to ""the appeal of this genre."" Funny dancing scenes, shockingly scary jumps and humorous corny one-liners makes this particular Friday chapter one of the most popular with the fans! Don't rent.. buy! Great for parties."
4,One of the Best 'Chapters' in the Series....,"I love how it takes place soon after Part 3 ended! I love the way Jason looks in this one. I love Jason's killing techniques. Tommy Jarvis, a horror fan (like me) and his sister must kill Jason Voorhees before he kills them. Rob is trying to find Jason, because he killed his sister in the 2nd one. Also this has the 'horny kids staying at an abandoned house and Jason happens to come by and kill them' plot, which is kind of overdone in the series! Overall, this is a really good chapter to add to the series, and I'm glad it's NOT the final chapter!!!"
4,Sweet,"First of all... this is a great movie. Second of all... it is one of the best in the series. Third of all...the person that reviewed this movie who said that they didn't know how Corey Feldman shaving his head made him look like Jason's mother is dumb. He's is supposed to look like Jason when he was a kid, not Jason's mother!"
3,The Final Chapter...What Will Happen Next?,"The unpeaceful, unrestful Crystal Lake, stands high and clear that the young and the oldies can't defeat the hockey mask wearing Jason Vorhees, mass murderer that kills every victim spotted in the eye. Mrs. Jarvis and her son Tommy are moving into a house near Crystal Lake, where other batch of unsmart and horny teenagers are also staying. The party is just getting started as Mr. Vorhees comes and whacks them all with his machete, axe, glass, and ETC.Well if this was the last FRIDAY, then it would been a 45/55 ending, but luckily there are more sequels to come. There is alot nudity, alot of blood, and alot of guts."
3,The Final Chapter ? .............YEA RIGHT!,"Ok, this one was probably the third best of all the Friday the 13th movies. The acting in this film is superb and the special FX are top notch. Well after Jason gets An Axe in the head at the end of part 3 they take him to the morgue where he ( yea you guessed it) wakes up and kills the 2 remaining people in the morgue and heads back to Camp Crystal Lake to shed more teenage blood. Tobe Hooper did all the FX in this film , making it one of the most violent in the series. But it adds nothing new to the series Just another mindless slaughterfest. I like the way this ones though. Check it out its a very entertaining movie."
4,JASON VOORHIES MEETS TOMMY JARVIS,"THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST OF THE SERIES.THE FINAL CHAPTER MEANS THE END OF JASON AS A MORTAL TYPE KILLER.HE COMES BACK INDESTRUCTIBLE IN PART 6. WE START WITH A RECAP OF 1-3. THEN WE SEE JASON BEING TAKEN AWAY TO THE MORGE ALONG WITH HIS VICTIMS FROM PART 3.JASON ESCAPES AFTER WE SEE A GRUESOME DEATH,ONLY TO RETURN TO HIS STOMPING GROUND WHERE VACATIONERS ARE PRESENT.JASON KILLS WITH LETHALNESS AND YET ANOTHER BODY GOES THROUGH A WINDOW.THE TWO THINGS THAT DID'NT SIT RIGHT WITH ME ARE THE UNPREPAIRED CAMPER,OUT TO TAKE REVENGE AGAINST JASON FOR KILLING A FAMILY MEMBER. HE COULD HAVE BEEN A PARTNER WITH TOMMY AGAINST JASON.INSTEAD,HE GETS KILLED WHILE YELLING""HE'S KILLING ME""!THAT WAS JUST STRANGE.ALSO,YOUNG TOMMY JARVIS SHAVING HIS HEAD TO DISTRACT JASON. JASON SHOULD'NT HAVE BEEN FOOLED THAT EASILY.WITH THE MENICING LOOK TOMMY GIVES AT THE END,YOU KNOW HE'LL BACK,AND SO WILL JASON!!"
2,This should have been the final chapter of this series: **1/2,"Yet again, Jason arises from the dead and gets back to killing anybody he can find in Crystal Lake. This movie is better than all of the first three movies that came before it and we finally get a character other than Jason who seems interesting which is Tommy Jarvis [played by Corey Feldman] who's a young boy with an interest in making horror masks. Another good thing about this one is the good make-up by Tom Savini, who's known for his excellent work in the Horror genre. This is one of the better entries of the Friday series and there are a few thrills to be seen here and there. And although it seems Jason is finally done at the end of this movie, Friday The 13th Part V would follow just one year later."
5,The Best,"This has got to be the best of all! The Acting! THe Originality! It's marvelous. Why did Wes Craven quit? This could have been known as his masterwork, but no(!) it will be someone else's."
1,Such a good movie...such a bad DVD,"I only have one word to say.... this DVD sucks !!Ok, they're is a theatrical trailer and the sound is not too bad...but what with the picture...Always fuzzy. The scene where the doctor put Jason in the fridge...we see snow in the picture...ON A DVD !! When the boy is kill in the lake, the color change to dark, blue and then dark again!! Same thing when the girl is pitch out the window, look at the curtains..they change color!! The scene when the guy is killed in the shower...no change on light intensity when Jason turn off the light.... Also, some of the music score is changed.... Very very disappointing.... I sold back my DVD and bought back the VHS edition...much much better..."
2,Belongs in the trash.,"This was the second worst Jason movie I've seen next to Jason Goes to Hell. Although the hockey-masked Jason IS in this, it doesn't show him a whole lot and Jason STILL TOOK HIS [freakin] MASK OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"ok, their dead, oooh look, dead bodies, yee haw.","oh i didn't know that was going to happen, not.as Corey Feldman said in this movie, this series needs to ""DIE DIE DIE! """
1,Boring. Boring. Boring.,"This is the fourth Friday 13:th movie. The first was rather lame, borrowing the style of music and some of the story from Psycho. The last 5 minutes were cool. The second was better, with more distance and awereness of not being unike, while not falling into the irony trap that later would poison movies in the 90ies. The third more or less cuts to the chase, with a mindless killer killing not so mindful teenagers.I don't know what they tried to do in this one. Skinny dipping. Making out. Jason appears, kills, and disappears. Shower scenes. Watching old black and white nude movies. Maybe the ending is good, but the rest?! Dignity, can we have some dignity?The one cool thing about this movie is that Halloween 4 might have borrowed from both it's beginning and it's end. But now you know, so you can still skip this one. (And now you know that I'm a nerd.)"
1,UGH!,although it has casted decent actors like Criper Gloven and Corey Feldman it hardly a movie worth seeing in any respect unless you are a abid horror fan.
4,friday part 4 deluxe edition review,"Excellent item, fast packed, shiped with all others, good deal! Thank you, see you soon for more shop!"
2,"Again, okay for a ""Friday"" film...","Another decent ""Friday the 13th"" flick. This one actually has a family involved as well as the usual bunch of college-students. And it was actually the first ""Friday..."" film I've ever seen!"
4,Fly to the Heavens,"John Williams never seems to lose sight of what kind of film he is scoring. No matter what the subject his is tackling he manages to find the humanity and spirit of it. His score for ""Always"" is one such example. The main theme is reflective and sad. One the envokes losing someone who was loved, but at the same time having the courage to let go and live. Williams may not have had the best film to score, the film itself has many flaws, but standing alone this is a fine album that is worth the buy."
4,"OK movie, but very good music.","All the reviews are talking about the movie. I'll talk about the sound track.This is a good sound track overall - a mix of older pop and orchestral scoring by John Williams.This is purely conjecture, but my impression is that most (but not all) of the orchestral scoring was ghost writing directed by John Williams. If it was 100% John Williams, I wouldn't call it his best work.However Track 7, ""Among the Clouds"" is as good as it gets - with John Williams or any other film composer. Amazing writing and amazing playing (especially the horn). This one track justifies the purchase of the disk."
2,soundtrack damage,"Seller did not disclose damage to cd. 1st song had static all the way through it. Too bad, that song was why I bought the CD."
5,Dervish and Death,"Mesa Selimovic was a great writer and it's a pitty that he didn't win the Nobel Prize (to my knowledge, he was never even considered). A talent like his is rare. ""Dervish and Death"" is a book I enjoyed reading very much, for the first time, and each time afterwards I enjoyed it even more. Unfortunatelly, this is not the case with all of Selimovic's works, as some of them are, to put it plainly, boring.What captivated me about ""Dervish..."" is Selimovic's sentence, which is so melodic that it almost seems like poetry.This is a demanding book and not the easiest read in the world. Even though it is a simple story, it takes time and it must be consumed slowly. Recommended but only if you have a lot of time on your hands."
3,fruitty ass,"the story lags in a lot of spots but the pranks and the jokes from Johnny B. , Kamal and Ernie make this one a great view. Alan Arkin as Ernie is uproarous and the 2 Jerkys are great. Johnny B. looks like if Sean Astin was chubbier and had a mullet.favorite linesErnie- wha...what the hell is a fruitty ass?Frank Rizzo- what kind of fruitty ass opertion you running down thereErnie- **ck you fruitty ass, thats what kind of operation we're running down here"
5,"THE BEST MOVIE EVER, BUY IT NOW RUBBERNECK","You better buy this movie right now you milky lickers.The Jerky Boys are the best, I can quote more of there stuff than any normal person should be able to.I love all their stuff, I have spent so much time laughing so hard at some of their stuff I have almost thrown up multiple times.Also I am happy to see (or hear) Saul Rosenberg's voice and Jack Tors's voice in Family Guy.I have loved the Jerky Boys since they were just bootleg tapes back in 1994, and still love them now.I am a happier person in life for simply having been able to hear their wonderful work.Now you little fruit a$$ get this DVD before Frank Rizzo has to wrap your head in with a ratchet, or Saul Rosenberg has to sit with you and show you his nub.Or Jack Tors rides his little bicycle into your face.And by the way, this DVD was region 2, but if you use dvd ripping tools you can write it back to DVD in region 1.Or just watch it on your PC."
4,The Jerky Boys,The movies is a classic funny movie.... It will have u laughing from the beginning to the end.... It's a good laugh all around movie. Something to sit home and order a pizza and relax with....
2,Not near as much fun,This game was recommended to me but we didn't find it near as fun as we'd hoped. The instructions are confusing and unclear. The game pieces other than the dominoes seem cheap and what we got in the box doesn't match what the cover looks like. I went for one of the cheaper choices so perhaps that's the problem.
1,"Great game, bad equipment",I really like this game for playing with family members. However I purchased two sets as Christmas gifts for grandchildren. Both hubs were broken and the directions were unreadable. A great game-buy it somewhere else.
1,"Disapointed, I am still waiting for it!","I received the game. It didn't have directions and one of the packages holding the dominoes was open and scatered in the box. I called the company that sent it to me and they couldn't tell me if I was missing any dominoes.I sent it back to the people that sent it to me and I am still waiting for the new one. It was suppopse to be sent to where I am on vacation so that we could play with friends that are visiting, but no game! It would have been nice to have since the remnants of Fay just went through the mountains where I am and we have had rain, rain and more rain. I am disapointed."
1,Not on dvd,"Be careful; If you're looking for Yellow Pages (1988) aka ""Going Undercover"" with Lea Thompson and Chris Lemmon, that movie is NOT available on dvd. The dvd being sold by numerous sellers on Amazon is actually Yellow Pages (1996) starring Sam Taft, Laura Kelly and Sean Murphy. Same title, different movie."
2,fair detective movie,"It is quite obvious that ""Going Undercover"" was not a box office hit and rightly so. The movie holds your interest at first but then the plot gets lame shortly after. The script is weak and so is the performance of the actors. Lea Thompson did not do a good job playing Merrigold. (What kind of a name is Merrigold)? I have seen Lea Thompson in much better movies than this one."
3,Going undercover,"I really like Chris Lemmon as an actor, and in this, he is the star. This video really showcased his talent for drama, comedy and action."
5,"Works great, no gouge marks on the bullets",Collet works great removing .308 bullets. Must be used with the Hornady Cam-Lock Puller and the correct Hornady shell holder and a Hornady Lock'n'Load press. Much better than using the hammer-type removers.
5,Excellent,"Highly underrated and unappreciated movie. The music, acting, storyline, everything is superb and should not be missed. Lots of famous stars, including a very young Christian Bale.I can't recommend it highly enough. And it's a great family film, so get your kids to watch it, too."
5,An Awsome-Must See Movie,"I thought that this movie was great. I watched it everyday in the summer when I was little. If I hadn't seen Newsies than I never would have known aout Christian Bale, if I hadn't known about him then I wouldn't have seen any of his other great movies like Batman Begins, or The Prestige. And I knew that these movies would be good because Newsies was good. It is about a Newsie strike that really happened, this movie tells us about events that actually happened but it is also entertaining and you want to keep watching it. This movie has romance, excitment, action, and dancing. Even though this is a musical it is still really good, the songs are catchy and the dances look great. Over all this movie is excellent and one of my favorites."
5,No Question-The BEST!,"Newsies is by far the best male-based musical ever put on video. I saw this movie when it first came out, and have been watching it ever since. Never before have I seen such character development, along with great choreography and vocals performed by a male cast. Christan Bale shines, and I've been hooked on him since."
5,Another one of Disney's great movies!,"A fabulous movie about the newsboy's paper strike. It has catchy tunes, and great dance moves. Christian Bale makes another stand out performance, and jumps of the stage with an electrifying performance."
5,Really good movie,My friend recommended this movie to me and I thank her for that because this is one of the best movies ever. It has great music too.
5,wonderful,"This movie has it all, love, drama, comedy, and music. And it ties them all together beautifully. The young boys starring in the film all put up quaility performances. (The adult actors, well lets just say they werent in it that much, and thats a good thing). Kenny Ortega and Penny Holmes did a great job with the coreography and Alan menkin and company composed excellent songs (great to sing along too, and on the DVD you can!!) Overall, if you couldnt tell, I think this movie/musical is superb, it makes me wish Christian Bale and David Moscow were making musicals today."
4,"A darn good movie!, actually","I remember seeing newsies when it was first released....I remember seeing it alone!! While it does fall a little short of the mark,(I suspect budget constraints),its actually a darn good movie!! I never understood why it didnt receive even a little warmer reception. The fact is there was so much 'poison in the water' so to speak about musicals and disney in general when it came out, that it didnt get a chance! Instead of being gratefull that someone was at least attempting to bring back the genre,most critics hissed like snakes at it. For all that it is, it does deliver, the music IS actually pretty good and quite upbeat.The choreography is fun to watch, and all the kids are first rate performers. The DVD is excellant by the way and lots of great extras. Its great that this sleeper has finally awoken!!"
5,NEWSIES IS THE GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME,"the music, the actors, and the plot are tops.....it's a definate bu"
5,AWESOME and touching,"I love this movie! I love musicals but NEWSIES is by far, my favorite movie! David Moscow is the actor that captured my attention in this movie. Christian Bale did an excellent job playing Cowboy/Jack and the rapport between Moscow and Bale was great. The ""Seize the Day"" chorale is one of my favorites - especially when David leads the chorale. ""Santa Fe"" is also very touching and I just love this movie. What more can I say? You gotta see it, well, you just gotta! *smile*"
1,This movie sucks like an 8-pound Oreck,"I noticed as I was reading the reviews that there was not a single ""thumbs-down"" review. I would point out to the teenage girls who gave it rave reviews because of the ""hOt GuYS"" that acting is what makes a movie. The kids in the movie were mediocre, but they certainly looked good compared to the wooden acting of the adult talents (Robert Duvall used to be my favorite). The only redeeming quality in this movie is the soundtrack, which, although somewhat contrived at times, was well-performed by the cast. It's still not ""Singin' in the Rain,"" but at least it is bearable. Kudos to the cameramen."
1,Lead a stray by Amazon ratings,"In all the years I've bought from Amazon this is the biggest gap between a items rating and our own experience.This movie sucked. The worst story, pacing, and performance we have ever seen.We immediately donated this one to the town library."
1,Musical Bomb,"No wonder the HOllywood musical has been in the doldrums until the recent rebirth of ""Chicago"" and ""Moulin Rouge."" This dismal, embarassing mess set the musical back ten years. The mob of ""newsies"" all look like California surfin' dudes who were called in to jump and leap around and do Kenny Ortega's trademark Flashdance routines. All the news boys are fresh faced, clean and neat. Even though they live in a flophouse, they act like they've never missed a meal. And then the great Ann-Margaret is brought in for a brief cameo before promptly vanishing from sight. Most embarassing is the movie's attempt to be multicultural by placing a young black kid smack in the middle of all the scenes featuring the historically all-white news boys at the turn of the century. It'd be interesting if this was remade by a real musical talent with some real talented youngsters. And at least make the scenery look like it wasn't just thrown up and freshly painted moments before the scene was shot."
5,Great Musical!,"I'm in 5th grade and our teacher showed this movie to us. I, personally, didn't want to watch it. I'm not into musicals, but I have to say, that it was an excellent movie. The directing is great, it has catchy tunes, and the dancing is well choreographed. I'm really glad we did watch this movie, because if we didn't, I and a lot of other kids would have missed a great movie."
5,hi,I think newsies is da bomb.It's a good movie for people into music and dance.We just finished watching it in music class at Viking Elementary.In Mrs.Kronn's Room.
5,One of the Greatest Movies,Newsies is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The music is wonderfully funny and the dancing is well preformed.
5,Newsies,Newsies is the best movie in the world! Disney is crazy for not keeping it released! I'm sooooo glad I got it before they stopped making them. Carrying The Banner Forever! ~*~Charm~*~
5,Newsies is the best movie ever!,This is one of the best movies ever made!!!!! I loved it! It had geat acting dancing and singing. i don't even usually like musicals but i loved this movie!! Jack Kelly(christian bale) is soooo hot!! this is the best movie ever! i love Newsies!!!
5,"Dancing, Singing... What else can you ask for?","The Newsies is a fun little musical. It sports a primarily male cast, which I won't complain about. The plot line involves young boys who sell papers in New York. When the big-wig who owns the paper cuts the profit that these boys make, they go on strike."
5,love it!,"To start with this is one of my favorit movies. I've loved it since I was a kid,back then I also had a crush on Christian Bale,aka Jake Kelly in the film.Its always nice when you can fall in love with a movie when your a kid and as an adult still enjoy it just as much( even with out crushing on the lead).This is one of those movies you watch 100 times before adding it to your movie libray then after a while pulling it back out to watch 100 times again."
5,Great musical for the whole family!,"We ordered this because it was one of our family favorites from when it first came out. It was as good as I remembered it but the storyline is a little over elementary school kids' heads without a little bit of explaining. A great musical, especially when introducing musicals to boys. My guys loved this when they were kids."
5,NEWSIES KIX ARSE!!!!,"OK, IS there a better movie?! I don't think so!! HOw could you possibly go wrong with millions of hot guys, dancing around and singing good songs in New York?!?!?!?!? AND SPOT CONLON!!!!! MY GOD, IS HE GORGEOUS!!! HE COULDN'T BE HOTTER! SAME WITH CHRISTIAN BALE!!!!!"
5,Extra! Extra! Read all about it!,"This musical about the Newsie strike of 1899 is a must-see. Written by the composer of Beauty and the Beast, the songs are all fun-filled and exciting!When Pulitzer and Hearst raise the price that the Newsies pay for their papers from .50 for 100 ""papes"" to .60, the Newsies of New York go on strike to get the price back where it was. Lead by Jack Kelly, an escaped criminal, the Newsies form a union and challenge the powerful. Will they win?With the songs ""Santa Fe"", ""King of New York"", ""Carrying the Banner"" and much, much more Newsies is an excellent addition to your Disney collection."
5,Holl@ from Delaware!!!!!,"HOlla!!! the newsies was the best musical ever!!!! i loved it so much! iF you haven't seen it yet, see it right away!! I thought it was unnecassary for the girl to kiss him in the end cuz she hardly saw him the whole movie. and she only sang one line in the whole movie!!!! well besides that, i loved the movie and i am planning on doing it as a show in a few years. well buy the dvd as soon as possible and the soundtrack(you will hear them singing in your head while your sleeping) cyaz!!!"
5,The Newsies are Front Page in My Paper!,"Although it wasn't widely accepted in it's debut, The Newsies certainly hasn't died from everyone's hearts. Musical fans & those of movies with energetic dance numbers will love the catchy songs that move the plot along.A breath of fresh air compared to the stale sequels & ""themed"" movies that have been bombarding the silver screen for the last decade. Granted musicals are starting to make a slow come back, The Newsies retested the waters back in 1992...way before Moulin Rouge or Chicago the Movie.The Newsies characters are memorable & very talented with their singing & dancing...prooving that there really is some real talent left in Hollywood.I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves musicals or just tired of the explosive action flicks, sappy romances & outragious/over-the-top comedies...this movie has just the right amount of everything."
5,"hey astronema, it rocks!","this is a wicked cool movie. i mean, y'all just gots ta see it! it's so totally worth it. i mean my cousins absolutely loved to a point that it became obsession, so i will send out a warning to the young teenage girl part of the world to be careful when viewing, characters may cause a rise in hormones. so watch it! love it! my friends here says it's accurate (MUSH)"
4,"High Pace, Fun, Musical & dance rolled into one","I thought that the songs were up-beat and catchy the acrobatics were fun too. Some of the charactors were fluff (adults), but I thought the kids were strong. I love the historical bases. I'd recomend this!"
5,Newsies- a great movie,"Newsies is one of my favorite movies. It is very good. The acting is great. Robert Duvall convisingly plays Pulizer. Christian Bale and David Moscow, and are great as Jack Kelly(the strike leader) and David Jacobs his right hand man. The songs are great too. King of New York, Seize the Day are two of the songs in it that make the movie great."
5,Five star movie!,"Newsies is a great movie! My sister rented it and she didn't even know what it was. We watched and fell in ""LOVE"" with it! We watched it like four days in a row. I wan't to buy it. I can't believe you can't buy it any more! It's a great movie."
5,you are a poor deprived child if you havent yet seen newsies,"newsies is da best movie in da whole wide woild! i accually heard the music in my acting class before i accually saw the movie (in 1992, i was only 8). and i have grown ta love da movie more and more. little kids love dis movie, adults do, and teens too. it has great music, comedy moments (i cant watch it w/out laughing) and wonderful acting (thanks to gabe damon). anyway, its not only a movie dat goils like, i know lots of guys who have and love it too! you can look newsies up on the internet and get thousands of sites devoted to this one small movie! and its definatly worth it to read the fan fiction stories (i should know). so go buy da movie, da sound track, da poster, and print off as many pictures as possible (like me)! and remember spot conlon is da best charcter in da woild. no arguing! love ya all! ""never fear brooklyn in here"" ""i say dat what you say, is what i say"" ""a porcelain tub wit boilin' water""!"
5,Best Musical,"I loved this movie. I saw it on regular television when i was nine and ever since i cant get the phrase ""never fear brooklynn is here"" by spot collins out of my head. it is the type of musical you ca picture yourself involved in. I really wish that it got better recognition but i luv it any way. I wish it would go back into print!"
5,my favorite movie of all time,"the acting isn't the greatest, but the boys are cute and the songs are great!! it's a whole load of fun!"
4,An awesome display of dancing and singing!,"The movie Newsies was a great movie. The launguage was not to good, but with out it it would not have been the same. If you liked Newsies I would suggest watching Swing Kids."
5,Watch it foo!,"OK. If you don't like this movie, u jus a freak! C'mon! it's the best movie eva! (ok maybe not, but it the best musical) no honestly, if u r a teen an u like guys ya GOTTA watch it! there's hott guys, it's very amusing, the songs r catchy, and it can even help you on achievenemt tests! it helped me, honestly, there was a q that i NEVA would have known if i hadn't seen the mo-v. And it's not JUST 4 chicks. i hav a friend, and her boyufriend LOVES it! he knows, all the songs and watches it jus about every day!Seriously. Watch it!. Just once! If ya don't like it, well, i'm sorry, you're jus missin out on a lot.c ya!- - peace out - -"
5,Completely Awesome!,"This movie is sooo great!!!! If you like a bunch of hot guys dancing, singing, doing whatever, you'll like this movie. It's a good family movie with a great plot and lots of fun... Other must see movies with Christian Bale are Empire of the Sun, Swing Kids, and Little Women (of course). He's also done lots of other movies. If it's going to be your first time to watch Newsies also look for Aaron Lohr and Gabriel Damon."
5,Newsies Rule!!!,"Ok, this movie is the best because it is the funniest and most intresting. The movie is just full of fun for everyone to enjoy. Plus, Christian Bale is the cutest person in the world!!!!! You have got to see this...You will LOVE it!!!"
5,Newsies will ALWAYS be my fave,"All right, as so many people have said, NEWSIES is a wonderful movie. I agree! It's an excellent movie for all ages. It's full of action, drama, and an AMAZING cast (Max Casella, Christian Bale, Robert Duvall, Ann Margaret, Dave Moscow, need I say more?). If you haven't seen it already, go see it!"
5,Exciting and encouraging to see these boys get together,This extrodinary movie is determined and fun. To see the boys get to gather and make a statment is amazing they worked so hard and they got what they wanted. The dancing and the singing is great. And for those girls some cute guys too.
5,ITS FABULOUS!!!,I absolutely adore this movie!! I watched it once several months ago and i am now completely obsessed. its such a good plot-the little guy rising up against the big guy. the songs are fantastic-i love cute guys who can dance!!
4,"Cheesy Disney Musical, but Christian Bale makes it all worth it.","Cheesier than ever in my older status, but still hot as ever with Christian Bale."
5,Newsies,"I just love this movie. I had a copy when the movie first came out and I lost it. I was very happy when I saw the collectors edition for sale. It really made my day. If you are into muscials, this movie needs to be in your collection. The Dark Knight is selling newspapers. See Christian Bale sing and dance."
5,Very good,I was really surprised by this movie...I wasn't sure I would like it my but sister convinced me to watch it and I am so glad that I did. A classic!! Recommend to anyone and everyone!
3,newsies,"Great cast headed by the young "" "" of Batman fame. Some songs are nice and has the Alan Menken touch but would be nice to have more songs."
5,Loved it,I just love this movie!!!... There is just somthing about it and you can't help but like how they burst into song while walking down the street. its great and i would recommend it to all ages even if you don't like musicals you will like this!!!
4,Great Musical DVD for Boys,This audio product as well as the DVD is great for kids. My son watched this in his 6th grade History class and just loved it. The fact that my family was from the lower eastside of Manhattan made it even more enjoyable to him especially since his Great Grandfather was a newsie! I highly recommend it.
4,"The ""professional"" critics got this one WRONG","We just finished this movie (which was recommended and loved by my b-i-l and his 2 sons), and I have to say that I enjoyed it too. The story was uplifting, the characters were endearing, the music and dance weren't great,but it was fairly wholesome and neat to see in a film about and for children. Smoking, drinking, and sexual innuendo were a bit overdone for my taste, but as my 12 yo put it, ""we have to remember that they are street kids, Mom."" My three kids (6, 10, 12) thought that it was great. They completely understood the story and historical significance. The youngest grabbed a ""newsie"" cap and started dancing and singing around the house. He and the 10 yo wrote up a review of the movie on the computer and are going around the house selling them ""newsie"" style. I think that the ""professional"" critics got it WRONG on this one; it was a really good movie, and had it been a bit more wholesome, I would have given it a 5."
5,the newsies,AWSUME movie.. its the best ive ever seen.. eveytime i see it brings back old memories! great family movie.. enjoy it guys!
2,horribly overrated,"I'm not sure where all the 5 star reviews came from. the music was OK, but the story was boring. Couldn't wait for it to be over. Curiously, on IMDB it only had 3 stars from movie goers. I will be cross referencing amazon movie reviews going forward..."
5,a hit,I really enjoy this movie and used to watch it often. I was disappointed searching for it that it was only affordable as a download since my kindle doesn't have loud enough sound for the whole family to enjoy.
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:With terrible characters (Robert Duvall's phoned-in Pulitzer, Teddy Roosevelt of all people), ridiculous choreography (I dare you not to laugh when the boys all start punching the air during ""Seize the Day""), a terribly formulaic plot, inane dialogue, and an overlong running length, it's not at all hard to see why Newsies bombed upon release."
3,Mediocre attempt at a musical,"The score is totally forgettable. The dancing is fine and the boys are cute, otherwise a failed attempt. And what is Duval doing in this pap?"
3,Just SoSo,"I liked this flim it was very realistic.It has a EXCELLENT plot and the acting is OK the casting could of been better.I gave it three star for the singing as a ""MUSICAL"" it sucks."
2,Lost in the mail,I purchased my dvd and about a week later after trying to track it I found out that it was lost in the mail. Amazon was quick to send me another copy but I was still disappointed that it was not received in time and i still had to pay for shipping.
5,Da best movie,"Ok the first time i saw the newsies i was 5 years old and to this day i still remember things about it. just recently i wanted to see it soo badly that i went to blockbuster which only had one copy and i have played that movie ova and ova. i think the movie was well written and the music was beautiful performed. i still know all the words to the songs and it is nice to be able to share this movie with my children hood friends who also have seen it and show it to my new friends. everyone should see this movie, if you are a disney kid at all you will love this movie!"
5,"Christian Bale and David Moscow are HOT,HOT,HOT!!","This is a really cool movie, most people have never heard of it but it is soo cool! It's great for all ages. For the younger ones because of the music and for the teens because of the hot guys.(Christian Bale, and David Moscow!!)"
5,A Movie for Everyone,"When I first had the privelege of seeing the Newsies I was 11 and in my 6th grade Chior class. Now, at the age of 19, I still love to sit down in my favorite chair and watch it over and over again. It is truly a well made movie that Disney should be proud of, as should all the boys who played a part in its creation. It is definitly a movie I'd recommend to people young and old to watch."
5,Newsies Movie,Once again I love this movie. I used to watch this in choir class on every holiday. Best musical ever!
5,Newsies,"I watched this movie before I saw the Broadway production. It's fantastic...and prepared me for what I would see on Broadway. The acting is superb and so are the many songs. I was once a paperboy myself, so I could identity with the characters. They are boys who join the union...and just want to make a decent living...on a decent wage. A must see movie and one that you can enjoy viewing over and over again!"
4,Watch a young batman dance !,"I'm 27 so Newsies was the first musical I saw that I liked 20 years ago when I was 7. Now I have kids of my own and I got it for them... but when I watched it with them I realized that Christian Bale was the male lead. So it was kind of cool seeing Growl master batman himself singing with a NY accent. lol ... Also, the movie is about the formation of a Union when they first starting becoming common and how this group of ""kids"" made a union with very little help from the Adults. So it has a good message to it...and the music is ultra catchy."
5,A truly wonderful heartwarming film for anyone and everyone!,"This is probably the best movie I've ever seen. It has a great story line, talented actors, and music that makes you want to sing along. This Disney blockbuster is a must-see!"
5,Newsies kick butt!,"Okay, yeah, it's kind of corny but it's a really fun musical and once you see it you're hooked. My sister and I list this as one of our faves and we sing the songs a lot. Oh, yeah...Christian Bale is just really, really fine."
5,Dont dismiss as a 'hotguy' movie,"I saw this movie as a kid- now at 23 its still my favorite movie. And its not my favorite because of the 'hot guy' cast- which someone said. I think it holds up because of the characters. The actors were sucessful in bringing interesting characters to life and these characters have inspired many pages of fan fiction for the last 10 years. The songs, sets, dances, story, directing work together to create the perfect package."
5,Cult Classic,Newsies has grown to be a cult classic among the people who were kids when this movie was first released in 1992. Massive petitions and numerous letters have gone into encouraging Disney to release this film on DVD. I am glad to see that everyone&#65533;s hard work has paid off. Enjoy this movie while it is still available.
4,News On the Newsies,"A long but entertaining, and sometimes unrealistic but based on a true story movie about newspaper delivery boys breaking away from the charges and rules being made during the Depression. Fantastic actors, and great scenery! Most kids would probably get a little bored of this movie, but others, like myself, would enjoy it. I forgot about the good music, too. I would recommend this movie to anyone above nine, unless your nine year old is interested."
3,"If you want some fun, check it out.","When i first watched this video 7 years ago, i was mesmorized by the dancing and singing, and the young, attractive cast. Revisiting it recentley, i was still impressed by the ""Annie""esque storyline and characters, however the most disapointing thing truly is the musical score( which is surprising with names like Menken and Disney attached to it). A few songs are catchy, but most fall flat. Upon seeing it again, i realized that i simply enjoy the film's simple ""underdog"" storyline and adorable cast. Teenage girls should appreciate Christian Bale as well..."
5,So that's what they call a family...,"Newsies might've been bad when it first came out, but people didn't see all the miracles in the movie!! This movie is the best!! I LOVE IT!! I own the soundtrack and also the movie on tape, I've been waiting for this DVD FOREVER! Anyways us ""Newsie"" followers today are all a FAMILY!! :-D Carpe Diem, this is a must own for anyone that loves this family, and if you've never seen it, what better way to purchase it then on DVD! That is all!! YAY! Pair a new shoes with fitted knickers...:-D"
5,It's wicked great,"I loved it! I first saw it a week ago and I've already memorized all the songs, the cast, and have been a major part in the develpoment of my friends' obsessions with Christian Bale and Max Casella (oops). I myself think Aaron Lohr is great but who cares? It's a wicked cool movie."
5,The best Movie in the whole world!,"I think Newsies is the best movie in the whole world. There is incredible dancing, and singing, and Spot Conlin and Kid Blink are the hottest guys I have ever seen. Spot: Never Fear Brooklyn is here! I say that what you say is what I say!"
5,Oldie but goody,"I purchased this DVD for my 13 year old granddaughter. This film has become very popular with young teenagers and she was thrilled when I gave it to her. She even took a picture of it and posted it on Facebook with the caption, ""Best present ever!"" It was fun seeing Christain Bale as a very young man. The music was great."
5,Excellent,"I was so excited to be able to find this DVD. I've looked for it on several different occassions over the last few years, and it was not available. Amazon.com made this a smooth transaction with the DVD arriving quickly at my home."
5,A looked over treasure,This disney movie is a classic and yet many do not know about this movie. It is a good musical that gives a taste of Broadway. Disney should bring it back by promoting it again as it does with it's other movies. I bought it because I watched this movie when I was a kid and enjoyed it. I was thrilled to have it again.....
5,Awesome guitar. They just don't get any better than Marc Seal!,Marc is just simply an amazing guitarist. Nothing more and nothing less. God blessed him and he's using his blessing.Two live tracks with a jazz band really bring this cd home. Awesome.
1,For civil engineers only,"It's strictly a technical manual. There are other, better books available to admirers of Santiago Calatrava and his creative and dynamnic bridge designs."
5,Well Worth your time,This movie slipped under the radar when it was first released but because I make it a point to seek out lesser known films I stumbeled across this one. And I am greatful. This is an exceptional film one I've never forgotten. It's powerful and vicious but it's also painfully beautiful.
2,"Decent, but waaaay overpriced","The mixes on the CD are rather flat-sounding, as they're mostly soundboard recordings, and despite the fact that there's some fun Soul Coughing rarities on the disc, it doesn't *feel* fun. This could be forgiven were it not for the combination of a few unfortunate realities:1) It costs over $202) Despite it being two CDs, the total runtime is just over 70 minutes, meaning it could fit handily on one CD.3) Soul Coughing was very taper/trader friendly, and many SC shows (some including most of the tracks on these discs) are already freely available to the public on legal download sites like archive.orgAdding up the track totals from many of the other Soul Coughing discs from Kufala, this seems to be a pattern. Two CDs for $25 which would fit on one, and are generally legally available for free legally.In summary: some decent stuff on the disc, but definitely not worth anywhere NEAR the price. Avoid it!"
2,disappointed,I was disappointed in that the picture and information regarding the product seemed to indicate it was a bed cover for the full back portion (seats removed) of the vehicle. It only covers from the back seat on. Quality is good but information deceptive.
1,Not impressed,"Bought this but was very disappointed in the quality of the bed liner. It felt like cheap plastic. If it was half the price listed here I would have considered keeping it, but for the price it is definitely not worth it. Returned it."
5,A masterpiece,"This book has everything you need, an index of 8000 verbs where you can see if the verb is irregular, the prepositions which can be used with the verb and a reference to a table where you can see how the verb is conjugated in all forms. In the table the irregular forms are marked in red, and also the irregular stresses are marked. It also includes a very useful section with grammatical notes. Don't worry about the french, it is very simple. It might be easier to find the book at amazon.fr. I have bought a lot of books before I found this one eg 501 italian verbs (which I don't like at all) and Harraps Italian Verbs (better but not good)."
4,Enlightening,This book gave me a very good and new insight of how to manage prototyping. It is enlightening for not only it explains and lists the topics that are important. It also gives us lots of practical examples of implementations.
2,"So many people love this book, what am I missing?","I bought this book on the recommedation of the Tom Peters' ""50"" books. I've so tried to extract some value out of it, but Schrage goes on and on without seeming to get to the point. This book seems to be a mismash of Shrage's notes collected over the years. Yes, simulations change the way we work and interact, but how can we best use them to communicate ideas or speed delivery of new products? I derived much more value from Tom Peters merely encouraging me to prototype than from ""Serious Play""."
3,Summary: Demo and Iterate in 213 pages,"If you already believe in creating building prototypes, don't spend the 213 pages. There are 190 pages that just say: big companies that succeed by building and iterating prototypes, and so should you. And yes, be sensible:- don't create ""full scale"" prototypes and start ""living the prototype""- look at the results even if they prove something you didn't want- don't show early protos to top management.- remember the law of diminishing returns - stop prototyping when the value-add is smallApart from that is has some nuggets:- Don't plan a lot, start by building prototypes (Ready. Fire! Aim.)- Prototypes create a conversation space, use that- Dare to use prototypes to discuss with customers- Create prototype driven specification and not vice versa"
5,Excellent book on pre-colonial Africa!,"This book is a MUST-READ if you're interested in the WAY Pre-colonial Africa functioned! It's an excellent example of African History being passed down thru Oral Traditions (with the aid of courtiers called ""Griots""), especially West African History. It's a GREAT book on the history of the Mali Empire, and the various kings that ruled. Its preface explains how Europeans have looked down upon Africa's Oral history for a long time, but that view is thankfully starting to change. It's also a small book (in size) and would not take long to finish. I LOVED it!!!"
1,College Book,"My daughter did not like this book; her professor never used it. the book did arrive in good condition, it was just never used."
5,MMMmmm Good.,"I expected a bit larger for the Price,""I did next day for an addition 45 bucks""But The responce from te Wife on Valintines day was worth it.."
5,"Excellent Product, Top Notch Delivery","Short and to the point. Ordered these three days before Christmas, they had them delivered a day before. I would suggest them to anyone. They taste amazing and there is a reason they sell out near immeadiately."
3,A Fair Musical Interpretation of Clive Barkers Fair Vision,"Nightbreed, like many of Danny Elfmans other scores is one filled of magic and mystical melodies and themes. The main theme for Nightbreed is a brillant piece of compositional work, with a chour and a orchestra reaching a cresendo in the opening of the theme. This provides us with a very nice wake up call and allows us to know what kind of world we are diving in to. Unfortuantly, this is really the only track that reached out to me and I feel that this score has somewhat been ""Uninspired"" by Danny Elfman (possibly due to the fact that I thought the movie itself was ""uninspired""). There are not many cues that really grab you (apart from the main title) and the music seems to have no direction. This doesn't mean that it is a bad score, just don't except it to paint a picture for you of the world that is contained in Nigtbreed. An enjoyable score that shouldn't be focused on too much when listening to it."
3,"Has its moments, but not Elfman's best","""meat for the beast"", ""party in the past"", and ""carnival underground"" are the best but this CD as a whole leaves something more to be desired. try ""edward scissorhands"" or ""batman returns"" for Elfman's better more interesting work."
5,A piece of art,"I never really could understand why most people tend to think that Darkman is better than Nightbreed. Because it really is'nt. Nightbreed is truly a masterpiece. One of Elfman's best, and certainly woth every penny. Take my advice: Bye it!"
2,Gum is stale!,First chew into the gum is not pleasant it's not crisp it's odd and chewy. Tastes fine after a couple of bites.
3,Orbit White Bubblemint Gum,"If you think you'd enjoy a ""Chicklets-Like"" shape and texture, the combination of ""Bubblegum and Spearment"" flavor, a sugar-free product - and prefer a sweet vs. not-so-sweet treat in a ""blister-pack"" - then This is the gum for you ! Wish it wasn't Still so pricey, though.*(Four Stars if you ignore high cost)Orbit White Bubblemint, 12-Piece Packages(Pack of 24)"
3,Good concise intro to XP.,"If you are looking for a quick introduction to Extreme Programming (XP), then this is your book. Inside this gem is the essence of XP. chromatic has boiled down the original XP manifesto (extreme programming explained by Kent Beck) and many other books in the XP series into one little book.The book covers the following topics:XP ValuesXP PracticesXP EventsXP ArtifactsXP RolesCoding, XP StyleAdopting XPWhile much of the information in this pocket guide is available in other books, I do not think that I have seen such a concise summary of Extreme Programming before. I would recommend this book to anyone who may be gathering an XP team together or is interested in learning the highlights of XP in a short time. That said, experienced XP practitioners will not find anything new in this book, but if you need a quick reference this book may be for you as well."
2,Better than you'd think...(** 1/2 stars...).,"I skipped part 5 and went right to this one after hearing good things. ""Jason Lives"" is actually pretty good for a ""Friday the 13th"" sequel. It's ""bulky"", meaning that thier was substance to it, and not just kill, kill, kill from begining to end. The ""main girl"", traditional to slasher pics, was more interesting than most in other movies of this sort. And we actually get to see kids at the camp this time; If you recall, in parts 1 and 2 we only get to see people preparing for kids to go to the camp. And it didn't seem to fly right by like others in the series did. Reccomended!!"
3,very average film.,"I'm a big fan of the f13th series i like all of them except jason goes to hell i cant believe they realesed that into the world,this film however is one of those it has it's good and bad.Thanks to those bastards in the mpaa they forced the director to chop down some graphic death scenes that could of made this better.The deaths in this movie are not that gross and not very good unlike other films in the series,and it makes kind of bored of this film.However Thom Mathews does a good job as Tommy Jarvis,and jason looks stronger and better than ever,also their are a couple of scenes that get you scared.So i would say rent it before you think of buying it."
2,Most Campy Camp-Killer In The Series,"This installment was a huge letdown. It tried going back to the roots of what made it great. Tried to follow the same flame that madeThe Final Chaptergreat by continuing with the Tommy Jarvis plot. To me it was just the same old thing with bad background music, horrid acting, and so-so effects.This is my least favorite film in the series. I was tired of that Tommy Jarvis bit from Part 5, and could care less about ANY of the people who got killed. Especially that dork in the beginning fromWelcome Back Kotterwho (thankfully) gets his annoying heart ripped out. Tommy is so annoying I was hoping Jason would kill him, hoping still that the sheriff would have done his job and kept him locked up.The ending was okay, in that they wanted to ""return him home,"" so that's where the 2-stars come from. Other than that, this movie is worthy of a rental at best."
3,part 6,"a few horny teenagers go out to crystal lake and jason hacks them up.sound familiar?later in the series theres a telekinetic chick,ny,hell,space,andfreddy.this was the last bloodbath entirely in or around crystal lake.its good in the set about average id say.the chick is a sherriffs daughter,so you know shes sexy.the only message i can think of is stay the hell away from crystal lake and get a damn room!"
1,"HORRIBLE, JUST HORRIBLE!","I DON'T KNOW WHY SO MANY PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD MOVIE. THE BEST ONE IN THE SERIES IS PART 4! THE STORY WAS STUPID, THE ACTING WAS EVEN WORSE, AND THE END OF THE SAGA THAT BEGAN IN PART 4 ENDS HERE AND IN A STUPID LOVE STORY WAY! WHERE'S THE SUSPENSEFUL ENDING TOO? OOOOH JASON OPENS HIS EYES AT THE END, I'M SO TERRIFIED! THE OPENING SCENE IS THE ONLY GOOD THING ABOUT THIS ONE. AFTER THAT, IT'S ALL DOWN HILL.RATED R- FOR VIOLENCE, LANGUAGE, AND A SEX SCENE."
1,The worst of the Jason series,"This is yet the worst of the Jason movies. It is entirely too far away from the Friday The 13th Saga, because it is humorous, and the music sounds like music from a comedy movie."
2,"Well, duh","It may well be the most proportionate cinematic blend of stupidity and fun yet shot. Were it any more asinine, it would be nigh-unwatchable; a picture of better diversion would surely necessitate superior craftsmanship or some inspiration.Whilst aping clichéd cues of televised fare, Harry Manfredi's ludicrous score also sounds purloined B. Herrmann cues and directly plagiarizes Wendy Carlos' score for The Shining. How did this dodge the attention of that most litigious of all composers?"
3,A Good Slasher,"Friday The 13th 6 is a trash film. That much is obvious. Does that mean it can't be fun and entertaining? Of course not. Jason is ressurected again and begins a new batch of killings at the newly renamed Camp Crystal Lake. The movie has a more stylish direction to it than the others. What this movie also delivers a sense of humor. This is something that was lacking from the others. Once again, the storyline is another rehash of every other Friday The 13th movie. Just be aware of that before you see this expecting intelligent filmmaking."
5,wow!!...,"This is right behind the 1st one as the 2nd scariest intallment to the series. It mixes Humor and scares together perfectly, and this is one which can be considered even by the critics as good because it has A PLOT!!... Plus this one doesn't take it self too seriously, but still comes out effective. See it!"
4,SUPER-JASON,"when Jason gets dug-up he goes on another killing spree.NOTHING SPECIAL,HUH!only this time he's super strong and his old 3rd time assalent,Tommy Jarvis, is suspected of the murders! END"
1,Is Paramount on drugs?,"I have to say that as a long time Friday the 13th fan I willNOT buy parts 5 or 6 on DVD.This may sound shallow, but I CANNOT get past the pathetic,poor excuse for a cover. Did Paramount lose the legal rightsto the original poster/artwork? That is the only sane explanationthat I can think of for not putting it on the DVD cover.Let's face it people, the cover sells the DVD!Jason lives is one of the best in the series. But due to thefact that the artwork ... (it's more reminiscent of BlairWitch than F:13th) and there are NO special features and it isNOT in 5.1 I will NOT BE BUYING anymore of the Friday the 13thson DVD.And you KNOW that a year or so from now they are going to releasea SPECIAL EDITION that actually has value.Do yourself a favor - boycott this poor excuse of a classicmovie series release!!!!! Perhaps then, Paramount will releasea REAL version of the film with ORIGINAL artwork!!!!!!"
4,"Not the best, but by far not the worst","The same as the others except this one is actually scary in some ways. This is Kane Hodder's best appearance as Jason. His eerie walk, his ominous turn of the head and his brute strength make him a match for a Michael Myers or Freddy any day. Worth watching if only for the site of Hodder playing Jason. If you didn't know it was an actor you may take him for a real mass murderer: he's that good."
1,Part 6 continues the useless sequel,I am a fan of these films. I have them all. So if i'm critical im sorry. Im rating these as the best of the Friday flims not general films. Once again this doesn't cut it. Tommy's character is awful!!! Why bring stupid humor here as well. This is a horror film. This is what made the series looked like a big joke. Slightly better 8.
1,THE MOVIE IS GOOD THE DVD IS BAD,FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 6 JASON LIVES is one of the best horror movies i ever seen but this DVD just [stinks]... i mean it's just in stereo no 5.1 surround sound no behind the scenes no feature commentary track with director Tom Mcloughlin and no DIRECTOR'S CUT do not buy this evil DVD it [stinks]...
4,"""One Of The Best Friday Sequels!""",Thom Mathews and Jennifer Cooke star in this 1986 horror sequel.Jason returns from the grave after a teen digs him up. This isone of the best Friday sequels and I'm glad to have it on dvdthat has nice picture and sound plus cool extras. I recommendthis.
4,THIS FILM IS THE BEST IN THE SERIES,"THE BEST IN THE SERIES[THOUGH I LIKED PARTS 8,9,AND 10] BUT THIS INTERESTING ENTRY IS FAR BETTER THAN DEPRESSING SEQUELS LIKE NOT VERY POPULAR 1, THE DREADFUL 2, THE TERRIBLE AND WORST 3, THE DUMB AND ROUTINE 4, THE BAD AND OTHER WORST 5, THE STUPID AND LESS BLOODY 7. THIS ONE IS THE BEST OFFERING BLOOD,SCARES,LAUGHS[INCLUDING THE SOLDIERS IN THE WOODS GETTING SLAUGHTERED BY JASON] AND THIS ONE HAS THE MOST COOLEST SCENE WHERE TOMMY JARVIS AND HIS FRIEND ALLEN HEWES BOTHERING JASON'S COFFIN AND TOMMY NEEDS TO SEND JASON TO HELL, BUT WHEN A LIGHTNING BOLT HITS JASON HE RISES AND RIPS ALLEN'S HEART WITH HIS HAND ACTUALLY SHOWING THE HEART AND THE BLOOD, AND OTHER COOL SCENE WHEN DARREN GETS IMPALED BY JASON'S SILVER POLE SPEWING BLOOD ON THE TRUCK MIRROR AND LIZBETH GETTING SPEARED IN THE MOUTH BY THE SILVER POLE.I REALLY LIKED THIS FILM THOUGH WHY DON'T THE OTHERS IN THE SERIES BE MORE LIKE THIS."
3,Jason Lives!,"Now back in the New Beginning when it was not jason, it lost a plethora amount interset for fans of jason, but the writers did it again. Usually in Friday movie Jason always shows up without being explained. In this installme they finally explain! The story is close to the first film in which the camp has opened up and kids are usually there when the return of jason, struck by lighting in his grave, to stalk the children. On the other the character in this installment who happens to be Tommy must stop jason before he kill again thus of his power and horrific strength. This one is a great installment to the trilogy and at times can be quite scary. The gore is also a good heads up along with the acting."
4,For a pretty big truck this thing aint bad at all,"You have to be a true F-13 fan to really enjoy most of the series. This one, however, is the exception. My only complaint, other than it's the only F13 flick without nudity, is the cheesy, coincidental lightning/fence-post ressurection. But the method of killing Jason in the end is both creative and actually makes sense considering the original plot of F13 part 1. The best part of the movie is by far Cort, the 80's stoner/slacker guy who probably only wanted to be a camp counselor to he could look for ""Things that go bump in the night.""If you haven't seen this one, and are a fan of F13, check it out. It has stupid humor that will make you laugh anyway, is the first in the series where Jason is Super-Killer, not just some clumsy man-child who gets knocked over and lays there like Troy Aikman after a sack. But again, there is no nudity, which has become part of the Friday the 13th tradition. Worth watching."
2,"Wow, this F13 is actually bearable to watch","I think the title explains my feelings. The series sucks, and is at times unwatchable, but even though the first scenes are just TERRRIBLE, the rest isnt too bad."
2,not THAT good,"O.K. this movie is not bad, but it wasn't nearly as good as I expected. My favorite Friday movie is the second part, where Jason appears for the first time with a trashbag ( sorry, maybe I mean something else, englisch isn't my mother language) instead of a hokey mask. However, this one just doesn't scare me. The killings seem kind of boring and lack effency. Jason brought back to life by Lightning striking on his Tombstone isn't my cup of tea either. REALLY scary scenes, like the last half hour in Part 2 I couldn't make out. Maybe I expected too much, but I found this one of the least decent parts of the series. Nevermind... if you are a fan of Jason, don't hesitate to rent it!"
2,"Very Scary haey"""" right.!",This movie is not scary one bit.Don`t and I mean DO NOT see or rent this movie!............................
1,Bad color problems,"Beware the new part 6 dvd. Do you remember that this movie used to be bathed in blue? Well, they've messed with the colors. The blue is gone and replaced by yellowish green. Some may not care but I noticed immediately and was disappointed. When you think of the color of this movie, you think blue. If you thought halloween 25th was bad and it was, get ready for this."
3,"Jason Lives, And He's Pissed","This is the last Frisay the 13th movie I like. After this, the movies get boring and more boring. I really liked the scares in this one. They were unsuspecting like 'Halloween'. The scene that is the best, is when he drops from above, and kills his victims.Eventhough, it is not as good as the first or second. It is better than the third and fifth. The director was really good at bringing back the good stuff. Out of all these films, I'd say my favourites are Part 1, 2, 3, 4, and VI. The rest go bad. Like apples rotting.The best time to see this is, if you haven't seen this at all. Now that I've recently seen this. It's not scary. But still, it's good."
4,the scariest one out of them all!,"when i saw friday the 13th 1-5,i thought jason was not scary at all.this one changed my mind right after i saw it.this one was kinda scary!"
5,Fast Delivery,"At first I didn't like this movie, but my child never seen it, so I ordered it and now I really like it. Great quality for the money and fast delivery was a plus for me."
5,Another one added to the collection,"Ive been wanting Friday the 13th part 6 for a couple of years now finally got it. Arrived in good condition for a affordable price, no complaints here."
4,Jason's back,"I rented this movie at the store and when I saw it I was pleased,he returns to Crystal Lake for revenge of the counslers that let him drown, but Tommy is in jail hes trying to get out to kill Jason, well he gets out and kills him at the bottom of Crystal Lake"
5,The best of the lot,"Rarely does a film contain actual scary moments, genuine rather than forced humor, strong characters and a decent story and this sixth Friday the 13th film had it all. If the entire series had been this great, I'm sure it would be respected more. Granted there are some other decent entries, with more scares and sense of dread in some of them but this one for me is the best all around. I can not wait though for the new special edition box set in Sept. 2004. Hopefully Paramount will put alot more than a teaser trailer on the discs as extras."
5,Exciting,"Old movie yes, but very interesting. Makes you want to see more. Keeps you on a bit jumpy. Makes you wonder when he is going to come and get you. Is he coming just to torture you or to actually kill you. What makes it more exciting is that everyone knows what happened there. Stupidly they still go there and continue to die there."
3,He's back,"This time we have Jason brought back from the dead and ressurected by his old nemesis. Tommy Jarvis (Thom Mathews from Return of the Living Dead) is still haunted by his run in with Jason as a child. This movie disregards part 5. Tommy is not the crazy guy he was in the fifth movie. But instead Tommy is a rational, somewhat posessed individual this time. He is a man on a mission. He wants to make sure Jason is dead for good."
3,A proper return to form,"After the horrid Friday the 13th: A New Beginning Paramount brought in Tom McLoughlin who delivered one of the best sequels in the series. Thom Matthews performance as Tommy Jarvis rivals Corey Feldman and is a improvement over the previous actor's performance. Tom McLoughlin script is better than most in the horror genre and the death scenes deliver for the gore fanatics,"
2,the only thing worse is Jason takes Manhattan,Silly murder movies with characters with no last names...pretty tame as horror movies of 2008 go...
5,The Best Of The Series!,This movie is by FAR my favorite one in the whole series! It beats the first one (which was HORRIBLE) by a longshot! You can't miss out on this one. They definitely did a great job with the storyline and the acting. This is a must-see!
4,One of the better Friday the 13th movies!,"Jason returns from the grave in this one as his old pal, Tommy Jarvis (played this time by Thom Matthews) digs him up, hoping to destroy him for good. Well, now he's out stalking the next generation of camp counselors.This one plays like an old-school horror film with the Sheriff who of course doesn't believe that there is a killer in his town. This movie has a sense of humor which helps seperate it from the predicatble killing spree format of the last few films though don't be confused, Jason still slashes, chops, and butchers his way through a new group of victims."
5,BEST,VERY GOREY VERY SCARY IM YOUNG SEEING JASON STALK CHILDREN IS DISTURBING VERY FUN NOT CHEESEY ONLY FLAW VERY SERIOUS THE MOVIES JUST SO SERIOUS WITH THE JASON THING THE BACK BENDING THE SHERIF IN HALG CLASSIC COOL THE THREE PEOPLES HEADS GETTING CHOOPED OFF AT THE SAME TIM VERY FAST AND GOREY GENIUS
4,because he's back...,after suffering a horrible installment (part 5) jason comes back and is almost at his best here. this film is indeed one of the best in the series with the exceptions of parts 8 and either 4 or 7. this film would've done much better if part 5 had never happened. jason makes a shocking return from the grave to go invade camp forest green and it seems that the only one who can stop him is tommy who almost dies in the process of returning jason to the watery grave....would've earned 5 stars if the film hadn't been edited so terribly. hopefully and unrated unedited version will come out sometime.
4,The best one yet!,"The story is a good one. The acting is alright. Alot better looking, too, (Jennifer Cooke). The music by Alice Cooper rocks."
3,rehash for breakfast?,"This installment in the never ending saga of poor misunderstood Jason Voorhees is getting back to the roots of the original story,ie;Jason slays sex crazed camp counsellors,as opposed to no.5 where it was a mental institution,which reminds me,didn't tommy put on the mask at the end of 5? If anyone has a suitable theory to explain why he donned the mask and picked up the knife and yet apparently didn't kill anyone. Theories send to wmcsk8@hotmail.com Poor misunderstood sociopath that he is, the boy needs love, I'm sorry the old eyes get a little bleary just thinkng about that fetid mound of flesh, floating again at the bottom of crystal lake, can you just not dig him up next time, I'm sure the kids are getting tired of having their summer camp ruined by a mass murdering soldier of the undead."
3,a low point in the series,"As I said above, one of the worst in this long series, but still great fun. I'm a big fan of the series, but this one seemed lacking somehow, not quite up to par with the previous films, except part five, which it neatly outdoes. If you liked the other ones in the series, you'll like this one too. Just don't expect anything profound. Don't even expect a storyline, or anything innovative. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. END"
3,Bad Way to Bring Jason Back to Life,"This movie definetly had some comedy in it, but I think the beginning really took some points off. Figures that there's a huge lightning bolt that brings him back to life. I guess you could watch this movie. After part 4, the series really went downhill. It's better than part 5 at least."
2,A fair attempt for a fifth sequel!,"I watched this film very recently in view of my project and was actually presently surprised. tommy Jarvis (aka Thom Matthews) returns for a 3rd time to do battle with the psycho once and for all. PLOT: Uncertain did he really kill Jason or not, Tommy comes with a friend and visits the grim grave of Jason. He intends to burn his corpse to completely make sure that Jason will go to hell for good. But by accident he resurrects the beast. While stabbing a metal spear into Jason a lightning bolt electrocutes him and brings him back to life. VERDICT: The plotline is pathetic but at least the producers add some comedy to the slasher flick. There is also a good soundtrack to the movie. But my advice still remains;STOP MAKING THE SEQUELS. THEY JUST DON'T WORK!"
2,Coffee break!,"The same boy from part IV and V returns to Jason's grave in an attempt to destroy his corpse and brings him back to life instead. Needless to say, it didn't work. Better than the last three in the series with some great songs by Alice Cooper and a sense of humor but still a lame halo of poor quality hangs over it's head."
2,its ok but is the best sequel in the series,"this movie is ok overall, even though I think they pushed the movies over the limit with having 9 movies in this series, its the best sequal out of the whole friday the 13th series, jason lives is poorly done"
1,good special features,"where is inteviews with thomas matthews or the man who played jason? or any other main character in this movie? all we have is commentary by people ive never herd of nor care to hear of! the special featurse are horrible, what would expect from paramount the worst studio ever. and no nudity? and no returning members from part 5? im done with these movies!"
5,Part 6,"One of the best of the Friday the 13th films. Tommy and a friend exhume Jason and due to lightning and the rather unfortunate location of a metal fence-post in the corpse's abdomen, the serial killer is up and about again.More stylishly-made than the older Jason films with some refreshingly original characters and scenes."
5,"An awesome ""Friday the 13th"" movie!","I bought this at a movie store, and it was a great entry in the series. It looked a little bit less-cheesy than the other ones before it, and it has a good plot. (I'm not saying the others are bad). Jason is resurrected by a lightning bolt, which is kinda cool. Tommy Jarvis from parts 4 and 5 goes to warn the sheriff that Jason has returned, but nobody listens, and heads start rolling as usual.Jason is played by CJ Graham, who plays the character very well. Jason's look changes, but it's still cool. I highly recommend this Friday film, it's a great installment. I hope you all enjoy it too!"
4,THE VERY BEST FRIDAY THE 13TH,"How could you POSSIBLY hate his movie? It's great! There was never such a Jason film. This Friday the 13th has great tongue-in-cheek humor, great acting, a great story, great scenery (Georgia was a great choice), great death scenes, a great climax, beautiful girls, you name it. It's just a shame that the great gore scenes were cut out. Hopefully, an uncut version of this great slasher film will be released someday. Jason Lives! He's here to stay and slay!"
3,The best of the Friday sequels! Good shocks!,"I think that this is definetely the slasher film of the mid 80's era. It's good to watch on both summer and Halloween. You can sometimes see it on a late night showcase on T.V. There's also three music scores by Alice Cooper(What could be better?). Two thumbs up for this one! Cast features Thom Matthews (Return of the Living Dead 1 & 2)who accidently wakes Jason up from the grave with a metal spike when a flash of lightning strikes it. This movie ended too quickly, I thought it should've played longer 'cause it was getting really exciting! I had great airplay on the Superchannel network when it went on to video after it's theatrical release. Watch it if you're a slasher fan!"
4,Gorgeous Rooms If You've Got Money To Spend...,"Loved looking at the nurseries in this book, but all of them were expensive to recreate. Great for those preparing a nursery with a LARGE budget."
5,"A series of lively, scientific essays on connections between tree species and the animals and insects which use it","Biologist Joan Maloof's ventures into the forests of the Eastern United states provide a series of lively, scientific essays on connections between tree species and the animals and insects which use it in Teaching The Trees: Lessons From The Forest. In leaving lab for direct environmental observation, Maloff's firsthand observations are lively and personal as well as scientific, exploring some of her favorite trees and their importance."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book disappointing. In several instances the author talks about great trees or forests that she had never seen, but were only a few miles from her. What I found most disgusting was that she used the names of those killed in New York during 911 in a ploy to save a plot of trees. She talks big, but acts little."
4,No Light Romance,"This is a bleak novel about Thatcher's Britain and the hopeless miners' strike of 84. It explores the limits of human endurance in the face of indifference from fellow countrymen, police brutality and personal betrayal. Not an easy read but it rings true."
2,"Looks great, but it won't stay open","I would not recommend buying this bag.I like the looks of the bag, and the space inside is adequate. You do have to place your items in just right for everything to fit properly. I've had compliments on it, even had a friend order one. The main complaint I've had which has had me several times ready to toss it is that it won't stay open. I'm constantly fighting it to keep it open long enough to place my items in the bag or take them out. I was hoping that with use it would eventually stay open. Not so. It's very frustrating trying to get items in and out of the bag and the bag keeps closing like it's trying to bite my hand off.I regret ever buying this bag, but for what it cost, unfortunately I'm stuck with it for a while."
4,Loved it except for one thing,"Bought this as a gift for my husband. It's a great briefcase overall - looks, durability... The only issue I have is it doesn't stay open. If you are looking for an item, you have to hold it open. Not a big deal, but could easily be fixed I think."
5,Great Laptop Brief,"Bought this for my husband (he chose it) and he's loving it. It's spacious inside,it can fit his laptop and other books easily with room left. It also has a shoulder strap but I doubt he'll be using it. Great quality and slick looking. Amazon estimated it's delivery date for Jan. 16th but it arrived an entire week before schedule. Amazon is amazing on their speedy deliver. THANK YOU!"
4,Es de buena calidad,"Me gusta mi maletín gracias, es un buen accesorio, y me esta resolviendo la necesidad que tengo, gracias por preguntar..."
4,"Overall, a nice brief case...","It's classy and definitely grabs peoples' attention. It has a real classic or traditional charm to it. There are some criticisms I must make of the case, however. The shoulder strap hooks are not well constructed, as they are prone to dislodging or coming loose when you lift the case by the strap. This creates situations when your case may literally fall from your shoulder strap while you are walking. Furthermore, there is not as much interior space as I had hoped. At any rate, overall, it's a nice briefcase"
2,regret,I had high hopes for this briefcase in terms of quality as the price was certanly fair. It lasted all of 6 months before screws holding the handles fell out repeatedly and were eventually lost; owing to its design (defect) the should strap will randomly disengaged and disconnect resulting in the bag falling at inopertune and embarrassing times... all of this could have well been avoided had the company paid a modicum of attention to quality and user feedback.
2,"Returned it, too big",had a mcklein case in the past. decided to give this a try.the 'leather' seemed very low quality almost vinyl like.the case itself is way too big. almost like carrying a piece of luggage.the pic is better looking than the final product.returned it.
4,Handy Brief,I have been using my brief case since I received it and I like it very much since I could put all my literature for the meetings without having to change them according to the meeting. It has a lot of space I like its appearance. One thing that I consider a flaw is that it does not stay open and it makes it a little hard to take out the books or put them in.In all I'm happy with my brief case.
4,It is big,"It is big, but not big inside just bulky but still very nice I recommend it, very formal very elegantupdate 4/26/2012I love it. so far I'm excited with the briefcase. unfortunatelly I needed more space inside thus what I did was, with a knife to remove the padded material in the middle partition (just the sides not the bottom). I did it very cafefully so I do not damage other areas or make it looks noticeable. Once that completed I now have more space to put more books inside, it carries much more weight , hopefully the handlers do not fell off or apart.So far the leather looks good, I have read other comments that they do not like the appearance of the skin but mine is nice, maybe the brown one does not look as pretty as the black one."
3,Strange but true about the strap,"The bag itself is great, but it's true what everyone is saying about the strap. I even changed the strap from my old Kenneth Cole bag and it still pops off. In 10 years with my old bag, it never once came undone, one single time, but for some reason the strap pops off almost daily... McKlein has to know this is an issue and should probably figure out what the reason is for this defect.The bag itself is great without the strap. Also, it's a little bigger than I thought it would be be, but all in all, I'm pretty happy. Now if I can just figure out this strap issue..."
3,Quality not what I hoped,"I just received the product and after inspection and some reflection, I have decided to return it. First impressions count and the first thing I saw when I opened the box was crinkled leather around the top edge. Looking at the handle the leather looked like it had stretch marks and could split at anytime. On the body the leather had a wrinkled patch. Inside the bag really didn't look like it would hold many files, although it did have a nice laptop pocket. To top it off, I feel like I got suckered in by the name ""McKlein USA""--silly me I thought the product was going to be made in the USA--not the case it was made in Thailand. I gave it a shot, the price looked good, the bag looked okay but it didn't work for me."
4,Leather Laptop Briefcase by McKlein,"I bought this briefcase last week and have been using it rather cautiously. This leather briefcase looks classy and is well constructed. However, there is one significant design flaw that I must point out. Others before me have mentioned that the spring clips on the ends of the shoulder strap connected to the bag often unclip when you pick the bag up by the strap. This is rather upsetting as your bag with all its contents can fall to the ground or into water or any other such place with disturbing consequences. I regret not paying attention to those warnings by other buyers and reviewers.Furthermore, interior space is rather limited for the size a bag of this size. There are three sections. The middle one that is designed to hold the laptop, is padded. Another section can hold a few accessories but there isn't much room for anything else. The other section is about 1 inch wide and can hold a note pad and just a small amount of paper."
2,Poor Quality and Product Finishing,"I just received this item in the mail and was very excited. It was well packaged, however; I thought that for the retail price this item (briefcase) would have been of great quality, but the workmanship and finishing along with the overall product quality are very poor. It says its leather but it almost looks like plastic as the material looks wrinkly and when you open the briefcase, it is more noticeable. Also, the finishing on one of the handles is already coming lose and it looks as it was glued together as part of its unglued. The inside is nice, but the outside/exterior view is much less to be desired. Not the quality i was expecting for the name behind it nor for the prie paid. Very dissapointed!!!"
2,"Sorry Zappa, this is bad","I first wanted to give this only one star. I saw it at a party when I was a little bit drunk and thought it was rather fun. But then I watched it again and could not call this movie anything but garbage. Reason for 2 stars: Its Zappa, nice guitar solo in ""Magic fingers"", the naked lady playing with her boobs, and ...ehmm..cant think of more."
3,"Zappa fans only... eveyone else, avoid it like the plague!","Man, I'm a big Zappa fan, but this was quite a disappointment for me. Zappa was good at many things, but making movies wasn't one of them. Don't watch this and expect it to make any sense at all. One of the things that bothered me the most about this movie is the fact that Frank's appearances are pretty much limited to the band performances. Instead, Ringo Starr plays Zappa's part, which basically involves him following the band around with a tape recorder. The cinematography gives me a headache too. On the bright side, the music *is* good, and we do get to see the band play a few songs. I guess my biggest problem with the movie is that I can't watch it without thinking about what it could have been. If you are new to Zappa, DO NOT start out with this movie as it could very easily turn you off from Zappa. Start with the albums."
1,Odd,"The question is are you a zappa fan? I'm not a huge Zappa fan but I like a couple of his songs. If you aren't a big fan then don't bother.This is a very odd, surreal and hard to follow movie. A lot of times you can tell the actors are reading off papers. I should have read more about it before I watched it. I thought it had a story.There were 2 good songs ""Lonesome Cowboy Burt"" and another that had a good guitar solo. Another good thing was a cute girl with big teeth that took her shirt off and rubbed her nips for a second.For the average movie watcher this movie is not worth your time."
4,Remembering Zappa,"If you are not a Frank Zappa fan, don't buy this film. Most of the music is opera parody. The story is a collage of scenes about the troubles of a travelling rock group who lives in hotels (hence the movie title) mixed with some other Zappa deliriums. Although I'm a Zappa fan, I must confess that the movie is such a bore, except for some rare live shots of the Mothers of Invention."
3,Its Always good to see Frank with a smile on his face.,"I've seen Zappa perform 4 times, followed him since I was a Freshman in H.S.I Studied his scores in college.Read the biographies on him, and found him to be a top notch guy who paid his dues and climbed to the top of the ""show biz"" ladder the hard way....writing music that went against the grain of most ""pop"" music of the 60s through 90s, paving a way for innovation all the way.Clever composer, above average guitar player, mediocre political figure. The type of guy most parents feared most in the 60s...I loved him, My band still plays alot of his tunes.Its fun to see the old Mothers clowning and playing together, running through the symphony....BUT, I feel Zappas forte was his music/live performance, not film. I'd rather see footage of his live performances other than avante garde film experiments with famous names and personalities...""Baby Snakes"" was better in my opinion."
5,I knew you'd be surprised!!!,"Well, maybe it isn't a 5 star movie, but I had to counter-balance all the 1's on here! This is a movie for fans. It DOES get better the more you watch it! Enough said."
5,"Excellent, a true movie viewing experience, great music .","After viewing this film one thing was left in the recogninces of my mind. Zappa is a genius. Not only is he a terrific guitar player,the music sequences display that, but as a film maker he truley shines. My personal favorite scene would have to be the part when Keith Moon, as the nun, thinks he is dying of a drug overdose. A close second is the notorious Centerville scene. Seeing to ex-Byrds wandering in a LSD like state is priceless. So, if you are a Zappa fan or you just want to watch a really ""Groovie"" movie, check out 2oo MOtels, and tell them Lonesome Cowboy Burt sent Ya. Jeremy""Thing Fish"" Simpson"
3,O'Toole First book,First in a series of autobiographies by the actor who also writes very well. Here's hoping he finishes the third volume.
5,Good quality bits for general purpose (light duty).,"I needed a set of general purpose, light duty drill bits for occasional home use. These serve that purpose well and the case keeps them organized and is easy to find."
4,Nice set of drill bits,"I think for the cost/benefit ratio, these drill bits cannot be beat. They are drill bits, so what can I say, except that they work and have a nice case. Works well for me......"
4,"Nice set, just as advertised","I really like this set of bits. I had a smaller set made by Black and Decker, but these feel more substantial!"
4,good bits,They look pretty standard to me. The drill bits seem to be pretty good so far for the first couple times I used them. I like how its pretty easy to snap in the drill bits also to the case.
4,"Work fine, but dont buy if you are comfortable with high-speed bits","I have been using a larger set of DeWalt high-speed bits for several years and am impressed with the quality and durability. I purchased this small set of bits to replace some sizes I had broken. Overall, I am somewhat disappointed with this set because the are not high-speed bits. Compared to my other set, it feels like it takes FOREVER to get through any material. It also requires more elbow grease. On the plus side, the bits are perfectly acceptable normal drill bits and perform their intended function well. In some cases they are better than the high-speed bits, like when you are trying to drill very slowly and carefully.If you own and like your high speed bits, do not buy these. You will be disappointed. But like I said they perform the intended purpose well."
3,Not for drilling metal,"I've read all the reviews here and I haven't seen anyone commenting on drilling metals. I've had this set for years and it works fine on dry walls, wood, and PVC. Few days ago I was in a situation where I had to drill open a door lock (which is made of brass). The coating peeled-off within a few seconds of drilling and the bit snapped shortly after. While DeWalt definitely offers some of the best quality power tools out there, this set is just a basic set. I would switch to titanium or cobalt for metal drilling in future."
4,Excellent Overview of Tax Treatment for Trading,The Tax Guide for Traders is an excellent overview. Investors who might qualify for deductions available to traders would benefit most from this book. Readers should remember that this complex area of tax law is subject to IRS process and procedure that place the burden on tax payers to overturn adverse IRS findings. Close questions of judgment are involved. Traders should know to keep current on Tax Code changes; and be sure to have a qualified professional prepare their returns. I highly recommend this book as a buy for all who actively invest.
5,Excellent Information,This is an outstanding source of information to guide anybody through there current tax status and to plan for the future as a trader. I'm very happy I read it. Every trader should read this book!
3,Good information.,This is a good book for stock traders. Many examples of how you should file your taxes. Advice on what you can do to help minimize your tax bill.
3,Good info,Read the book and sign-up for Bob's conference calls. Traders don't be greedy. Take profits! You can never go wrong with taking a profit.
5,Stay Out of the Light,"Got lucky and attended a Tom Petty concert in Honolulu, Hawaii way back in 1981. ""Torpedoes Tour."" About mid-set, Tom leaves the stage during a Mike Campbell, guitar solo. Those pesky light guys caught him with their spots on the right side of the stage. With his nose in a straw snorting some kinda white powder, our Tom just didn't seem to care and continued on with his 'business'....Well, the whole place went NUTS....You sorta had to of been there BUT it was a great Rock N' Roll Moment.This CD: ""Pack up the Plantation"" is easily one of the best live recordings from the 80's. Tom, was ""everyman's"" Rock Star and a very cool one at that. If you are building a proper Tom Petty Collection, this CD really needs to be part of that collection...Period, this one is essential.FIVE STARS!!!"
3,not bad,"In the late 80's, Tom Petty went into a bit of a creative slump, and a live album let him put out a record without having to write new songs. Fair enough, this isn't a bad recording, and it's nice to have another Byrds cover, something T.P. and the Heartbreakers have always done really well in concert. My main problem with this CD is that the horns really detract from the band's original sound, which was great in the way it recaptured the simple (brass-free!) flavor of late 60's rock bands. The horns ruin that for me, but you may feel differently (I mean, I didn't like the bit of trumpet the Byrds put after the chorus in the original ""If You Wanna Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star""). As someone else noted, to fit the original double album onto a CD, two good tracks were removed, including ""I Need to Know"", one of my favorites on the vinyl version."
3,Incomplete!,"I have this on cassette & have played it til it warped. Imagine my disappointment to find it on cd with my favorite song by Tom & the boys-""You Got Lucky"" missing! This is the best of his live songs-it's on cassette but not the cd! Otherwise it still makes for a great live album."
4,lost classic,This was indeed a great overlooked tour and record.....TP's southern accents tour...will this album every get a FULL release with all the tracks that were on vinyl? Will it get remastered? Will Southern Accents get remastered? Will the pack up the plantion VHS going for 80 bucks ever see a DVD release? Come on Tom there are diehard fans like me that would grab those releases!
4,You may never go to another rock concert,"Skipp and Spector are rock and rollers at heart and this is their rock and roll horror novel (with a nod towards heavy metal). Like the music, it assualts your senses and in the end you know you've had one heck of a ride. This is the boys at their best."
4,Very good basic guide,"Quark is a huge, complex program, and every guide book will have certain limitations of scope. Having said that, I highly recommend this guide for beginner or pro, since it covers the subject matter with unusual clarity."
4,Quark for dummies,"I ordered this book for a job I did not get, however it is still going to be very valuable in my current job. I am gladd it was available."
5,Glad to learn the facts on Diary Allergies,I would like to acknowledge Denise Jardine for her precise information about being allergic to dairy products and what to look for when reading ingredient labels. It is amazing how many store products have diary additives; all the way from vegetable and meat entrees to mayonaise and pancake mixes. My fiance no longer has digestive problems and inpart just purchasing a loaf of bread that is dairy free was a big help. Her recipes are easy to follow and I taste great. Denise brings old recipes [with wonderful flavors] to the table with new ingredients. Thank you Denise!!!!
4,Great Dairy-Free Recipes!,"This book, Recipes for Dairy-Free Living, is full of yummy recipes. There are recipes for all meals to include deserts and sauces. Vegetarian dishes and broiled vegetable dishes are also included. There aren't as many pictures in this book as I would like, but all the recipes sound really good."
1,Only for thoes with extra free time and spending money.,"Recipes For Dairy-Free living is not a great add to your home cookbook collection. I would tell most people to pass it up. While the author boasts ""everything can be found in the supermarket"" and over ""100 innovative creations"" you WON'T want to make many of these recipes. Not much in this book could be made quickly or on a tight budget. There is a large amount of ingredients and steps to most of the recipes. The sections on sauces, quick breads, and sweet endings are the best in the book, but still leave you wanting more. I found that this book isn't written for a new cook and there is no nutritional values given. I know it is very important to me to see how much calories, fat, calcium, and fiber that I'm eating. Go looking for another cookbook. It's not worth your money. And I bought mine used!!"
2,not terribly helpful,"I already knew I could eat meat and potatoes and vegetables ... who needed another book of recipes like that??? The point of a dairy-free cookbook should be to give alternatives to dairy products, i.e.: how to substitute with rice milk, soy yogurt, etc. I do admit, though, that I'm looking forward to trying the coconut ice cream!"
4,Great series.,"Only complaint is the DVD menu could have been better, a little more explanation about ea. episode, but that's not really a problem.I like the packaging compared to other products, it opens like a big book, very sturdy.The extra deleted scenes are interesting too."
5,One of the Best Shows on Television....EVER,"Superbly written with a story arc that spans the entire run of the series.Acting, adrenaline, and all that other good stuff that makes you spend (or should i say INVEST) time in watching the crooked path Vic Mackey walks on. You'll always want to see what happens next....even till the end. Even if you've never heard of the show, or have never watched an episode, the price is too good to pass up on the entire series. YOU CANNOT watch television the same way and in this day and age where pure narrative/fictional shows are getting drowned out by reality garbage, THE SHIELD set a new standard. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHOW. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. The Shield has the best elements of every other show: 24, The Sopranos, Law and Order, and much more. BUY NOW.SJY[...]"
1,not worth the money,bad dvds dont order you wont like the way the product comes. just a bad company bad dvds dont order you wont like the way the product comes. just a bad company
5,Fantastic show!,"This is one of the best shows I've seen period! LOST kept me interested through about 75% of the series, this one almost lost me near the end but drew me right back in. I want to watch this again I love it so much. Sure there are some spots (second to last season) where things start to get a bit foolish (and into some of the final season) but it held my attention. If you don't want to watch it all you should at least watch the season with Forest Whitaker, he gives simply the best most outlandish on screen performances since William Shatner's performances on Star Trek!!!"
5,best investment i ever made.,my husband loved this series and was very happy to receive this as a gift will do business again .
1,the shiel the complete series,"Don't worry about the reviews about scratched discs in the set. Sony fixed the problem about the discs, they have now put paper covers over the discs preventing them from being scratched. The discs in my series are scratch free and work great."
1,The Shied Complete Set.,"I just purchased the Shield Complete box set, the 3rd disc for season one was missing. In its place was an additional disc one for season 1."
5,Great Disc Set,The disc's come in this nice looking case that looks like a book which you can displaygreat setup for the cost I highly recomemend you buy for the price
2,Scratched DVDs and glue spots ...,"Just received 11-12-12 , nice boxed set and looks like plenty of extras .Everything seems fine , untill I pulled dvds out of pockets .Most have several scratches and many have what I guess to be glue spots .Guess I'll have too watch all of them right away to see if they are good or bad .At $70, you get what you pay for , crap ."
3,Scratched,"Many of the DVD's were scratched, and scratched badly upon opening. This is not an Amazon shipping problem, but a Sony packaging problem. It seems that the glue to hold the pages together dried on the inner sleeves, and when you pull them out (DVD's) the scratch on the hard glue. I am getting a replacement set, hopefully this was an original production run problem."
1,Packaging not Practical,"I only give this set one star because of the way it was packaged.If it was just about the quality of the series and the episodes themselves I'd give it 5 stars.The set is packaged in a coffee table book type case that, while great looking, is not practical for holding DVD disks. The DVDs have to be slipped in and out of a very tight space in between two sheets of cardboard. Almost every disk in this set had small scratches on them and some had huge gashes in them. A few were unplayable. There were also small particles of glue on the disks that came off of the cardboard book packaging."
1,Still having glue spot problem.,"I would have given it 5 stars for the series, but I am rating the product. Though I had read the reviews about the glue spot issue, there were many saying that the problem was fixed, so I took a chance. Oh well, still glue spots on almost every disk. Return went well and hassle free. I will keep an eye on this and maybe order it again later."
4,present for Christmas,I bought this box set as a Christmas gift for my husband who loved this show. The only thing I was disappointed about when I got the package was that it was not in any sort of padded envelope or box. One of the corners got cracked and had I been giving this to someone other than my husband I would have been very upset to give something that was damaged. So far that is the only damage we can see - since he hasn't opened it up yet to start watching them.
5,exactlento!!!,"VEry cute bear, my partner enjoyed the sweetness of the message and was delivered on-time... thank you very much"
4,Handy bottle,"I got this bottle so I could get super saver shipping, and I'm glad I did. It holds 1000ml of water, so if you remember to empty it twice a day, youll be getting over the 8 cups of water a day you're supposed to drink. The only problem I've had with it is that it's not spillproof and will leak if its upside down, but I carry it in my backpack and as long as it doesnt tip over inside it's good."
3,made with pear juice....,not a bad drink - but why call it lychee juice when the ingredients are pear juice and lychee puree (in that order)?
1,Misleading Picture,"The picture of this key chain shows a retractable metal chain not wire, however I have received a standard retractable wire key chain. Also it's only half chromed and half black plastic. Disappointing quality."
1,Not what was pictured,"After taking valuable time to research and find the right heavy duty keychain, needed for work, I was surprisingly shocked when the product I received was NOT the item pictured. The item pictured was an all metal retractable keychain with a metal link cable. What I received was a half metal, half plastic housing retractable keychain with a very thin plastic wrapped metal cord. Over all this item seems very flimsy and not the heavy duty retractable keychain that I expected to receive based on the picture. I am very bummed and would not recommend this vendor to anyone who is thinking of purchasing something from them."
2,Description not correct,"Keychain works great but is only 18"" not the 24"" in the product description. Very disappointing."
2,Phil's retracting key chain review,"Sorry, not so good, I was so impressed with the way it lookedbut about 9 hours into wearing it it came apart on me and I could notget it back together, will probable just throw it awayl, Oh well, one itemout of about 50 ain't too bad.You all have a good daySincerely,Phil Haddock PaulsValley Oklahoma"
5,Histarical Clever Great Wish I had 10 copies,"One day I had to go to the library to get a book from my 7th grade reading list and I saw this huge book of comics and I just had to take it out. I read it probably 100 times .It became my favorite book.My favorite comics were Popeye, Gasoline Alley, The Smythes,and Krazy Kat. I love this book and you will to. So my advice to you is if you love comics you will love this book!"
3,Dewalt Bits in Throw-away yellow case,"I too bought these Dewalt bits, actually two different sets with different cases. The first case's hinges broke apart and the second sets case had the insert holding in the bits come unglued. The bits themselves are bits, nothing special about them. I have other dewalt products and this one, especially the case, is uncharacteristically of poor quality."
2,Ho Hum,"Was writing for the high school paper a really important factor in shaping your personality? Was it important to you to be in the ""right"" group in high school? If yes, then you might find The Rotter's Club interesting. If, however, you never even knew your school had a paper, or didn't care about what was happening in the faculty lounge then you will find The Rotter's Club, and the group of kids in the book whose life seems to revolve around their school activities painful to read.The premise of this book is great: growing up in an England that is in economic and social disarray. There are strikes, IRA bombs and new artistic movements that are changing the landsacpe in England. But, what do we read about in this book? Mostly how much a character, Ben Trotter, who is insufferable, wants to get into the pants of the school hottie. Guess what, because of his sincerity and writing ability, he does. Like, who cares?"
3,"Enjoyed the read, but. . .","I enjoyed this story, however there was much more attention to the car factory business than the development of some of the story line. The characters were real to me; I could just see RC as this short, rich older man with his chest poked out with his conjured-up prowess!! I couldn't quite get an understanding of the only murderer in the book, though!!I didn't really appreciate the black-white marriage until the end when Thyme finally got some self realization and put the entire relationship in perspective.I love the names Ms. McMillan gives to her characters! Starting with Mink and Sterling and now with Thyme and Khan!All in all a good book, worth a trip to the Library! I keep reading everything she writes!!"
1,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, I found Blue Collar Blues to be quite disappointing. The characters were poorly developed and there were several times when the plot just didn't make much sense. While Ms. McMillan certainly knows the automobile business, she could have spent more time on giving her characters more depth."
2,"If you are bitter and jaded, you will LOVE this book!","The author has finally found a vehicle to release her many years of pent up frustrations, jealousies and prejudices. The only developed characters in this book are the oppressed, downtrodden and otherwise used and abused women. Everyone else, especially the men and anyone who is depicted as being white or non-black is represented as very one-dimensional. I will give Ms. McMillan some credit though. Her sex scenes were beautifully and erotically done with style. But the book ultimately fails by thinly disguising the authors extremely racist and sexist viewpoints towards non-blacks and men in general. Small-minded, angry black women will absolutely love this book."
3,It's all in how the shirt is made.,"BLUE COLLAR BLUES had a lot of interesting moments, however, because of the technical aspects of the automobile industry, it slowed me down. The characters were slightly one-dimensional and there were moments where it seemed like I was reading a dime-store romance novel, due to the dialogue between certain characters. It also seemed to have spasms of time displacement. Certain pivotal scenes took place between chapters (sometimes between paragraphs) that the author had to inform the reader about because it wasn't inserted within the the story. It was a little like QUANTUM LEAP. Although this novel didn't affect me like ONE BETTER, it still had enough to offer."
2,Not very good...,"This book was not very good at all. I'm sorry but I couldn't get with these soap opera characters. The characters constantly behaved in ways that were totally unrealistic. I know she was trying to give the book an international feel, but she failed in this respect also. I hate to sound so critical but this book was recommended to me and I was highly disappointed.On the positive side, the sex scenes (and there were lots of them) were wickedly good."
1,"Dumb, Dumb, Dumb","Unsympathetic, underdeveloped characters. Unrealistic and inaccurately portrayed situations. Flat, undescriptive, poorly written and seemingly unedited prose. This book read like its own first draft. Don't waste your time or your money."
2,Depressing beyond belief.,"I was able to ""borrow"" this book from the bookstore where I work. I read/skimmed it in the space of a few hours, because I am a fast reader. Thyme's husband's playing both his wife and his mistress depressed the hell out of me. The whore Louella depressed me. Not many things about this book DIDN'T depress me. I don't know, maybe it was just my mood."
2,Very disappointing.,"I found this the weakest of Ms. McMillan's books. Her characters were not fully developed--I really didn't get ""into"" any of them. The dialogue was very artifical and contrived. Previously Ms. McMillan could be depended upon to make the pages sizzle with her sex scenes...NOT! Did she have a ghost writer pen this?"
1,Don't Be Fooled--Not Really IR,"If you are looking for a BWWM IR book with a HEA ending, this is NOT the book to buy. As a matter of fact, as I was reading this book, I got the not so subtle hint that the author (or her characters) were decidedly against IR relationships. I can't say I enjoyed this book. The marriage between the BWWM (secondary characters) ended in disaster--he was or had been maintaining a double life for many, many years while they were married. When ""stuff"" hit the fan, the relationship had nowhere else to go but down the drain. Not my favorite cup of tea."
1,Descriptive tacky drama,This was my first read by Rosalyn McMillan and will be the last. It read like several bad books in one. I could not identify the talent of the author or the direction of the book. This was just a mess!
2,A Disappointing Read,"I have read all of Rosalyn McMillans books and this the most disappointing. I struggled with the characters, not being able to sympathize with any of them. I thought at first Thyme would be the one to bring everything together but her relationship with her husband and her struggle with her career was just not well developed. The other chacters were even less interesting and added nothing to an already weak plot. I was really disapointed with the story flow. There was NONE. Just a series of incidents. I'm just glad I did not buy it and got it from the library. This is not a work to add to your collection."
3,It was a good story,"I did enjoy the book, however the workings of the factory and the union stuff was a little boring and too deep for me. I thought the murder scene was deep. One thing that I really like of Rosalyn McMillian is how descriptive she is. I could feel every gunshop wound. I spoke with some people who work in the plants and they could really relate to what was going on inthe book."
3,It was okay....,"I have read all of Rosalyn McMillan's books and this one was my least favorite. I personally had a hard time getting into this story. I don't know if it was the setting of the book (Champion Motors which is an automobile factory) or if I just wasn't that interested in the characters, but this book was a struggle for me to read. In fact, I considered, SEVERAL TIMES, putting it down although I really don't like starting a book and not finishing it. With that said, after I got a little further than halfway through the book, the story did pick up and it made up for the boring first half of the book somewhat."
2,this book received two stars because of the ending.....,"Ms. McMillian should have taken a little while longer to write this book. Athough she has a lot of knowledge about the automobile industry, this still made this book just plain boring. None of the characters had any depth. Was there a plot to this book? I will advise everyone to read the epilogue first before buying the book, it is the only exciting part. Usually Rosalyn has some really raunchy sex scenes in her books to at least keep you interested but of course that was not the case with Blue Collar Bore!!!!!!!"
2,"Disappointed, Again!","This is the second book that I have read by Ms. McMillan and again I must say I was disappointed. When I am reading for enjoyment it shouldn't take me two months to read a book. I like to finish a book when I start it and sometimes this is a difficult task with her books. Ms. McMillan is a very descriptive writer, sometimes using a paragraph or two to describe someone or something, but I find that it tends to interfere with the storyline. I think her books would be a lot better and easier to enjoy without so much flowery writing. As for the storyline, I found this one to be a little more interesting than her last book but in the end everyone basically came out okay except for Luella, of course."
5,I love it!,"This is the first carpet cleaner I have ever owned. Previously, I always rented one from Wal-mart. When I saw the low price on this, I thought it would be worth a try. And it is. It is not a Cadilac, but it is very easy to use, to clean out afterwards, and I think does a great job. I add vinegar to the cleaning water, and not any detergents or other chemicals. Once when I had a particularly germy thing going on (thanks to my dog), I also added some bleach. It worked great! No stain, no smell. I'm very happy with this cleaner. For the price, it's a real bargain."
1,AWEFUL,I have never had a Bissell that lasted more than a year. This one didnt even work out of the box. The water wouldnt come out. I WILL NEVER BY ANOTHER BISSELL.
5,Under-rated,"This album not only demonstrates Elton's versatility of style , but clearly show's how strong and powerful his voice is. Too bad , this album is so under-rated. It's a showstopper. Judy"
2,Ouch! This is terrible!,"I'm a fan of duets, and Elton John, and I enjoyed the few clips I listened to on Amazon. But, yuck! This thing's terrible. Granted, a few are worth a less harsh lambast than the rest, but you have to slodge through a half dozen tracks of complete garbage to get to them, and even they aren't enough to save this really really awful release. Let the sun go down on this one. Order something else!"
3,Duets,"Duets~ Elton John should have been a great idea. Take a bunch of hits and sing them in duet form and it should be able to strike gold right away? Well it is not exactly ""rocks"" that one is presented with rather it feels like a goldplated item. It sure looks nice on the outside but dig a bit deeper and there is like nothing golden about it. Some of the duets are great like P.M. Dawn, Tammy Wynette (the best of the lot), Little Richard and Kershaw. Then again we get real underachievements like the duet with k.d. lang (she sounds like an old man) and the last track is strange. I was quite disapointed since this album has massive potential to be good but he wastes on picking questionable singers like k.d. lang and it seems like instead of a golden experience we are left with a gold plated experience. What a shame."
2,toddler polar bear costume,"My four year old said he wanted to be a polar bear for Halloween and I was thrilled when when we found this costume on amazon. Unfortunately, however, the size is closer to 2T than 4T so we had to send it back. That is my first complaint. The second is that there was a very high shipping cost for this item (about $10) which was not refunded and in addition we had to pay additional shipping fees to send it back making it a costly exercise. Moreover, there were no clear instructions for returning the item. Instead, a phone no. was provided and after a long wait we finally reached an operator who provided return instructions. While the costume was cute, the whole experience has discouraged me from ever ordering a costume online again."
5,Outstanding,"I purchased ""Here & There"", another live Elton effort, because of the tremendous strength found here on ""Live In Australia"". While Here & There is quite good as well as being a double vice single CD, it's not quite up there with this record's vocals, piano, & orchestration. Live In Australia is absolutely amazing. Definitely recommended."
5,This Albums Takes It All!,"ABBAcadabra's second effort at dance covers of Abba songs is a smash! With dancefloor covers of Abba and Agnetha songs. The bright spot on this cd by far, was ""Wrap Your Arms Around Me,"" a cover of an Abba solo song originally performed by Agnetha. This is one of their only ballads on the cd(besides ""One Of Us"") which features dance tracks. I've owned this cd for over 5 years now and ""Wrap Your Srms Around Me,"" never gets old.Other selection that make this cd worth buying are, ""Angel Eyes,"" ""The Winner Takes It All,"" ""Eagle,"" and ""The Day Before You Came.""A must for any Abba/Dance fan!!1. Summer Night City (9/10)2. Angel Eyes (10/10)3. Eagle (10/10)4. Lay All Your Love On Me (Definitive Mix) (8/10)5. Take A Chance On Me (9/10)6. The Day Before You Came (10/10)7. Knowing Me Knowing You (8/10)8. One Of Us (8/10)9. The Winner Takes It All (10/10)10. Wrap Your Arms Around Me (10/10)"
2,Bava at his WORST,"""Graveyard Disturbance"" may seem like an interesting zombie/horror movie at first sight, but in reality, it is a sloppy made for tv joke that not even the biggest of bava fans should enjoy. The music and atmosphere are all this movie has going for it. It starts out promising enough, with kids being dared by a strange bartender to spend the night in a crypt under his tavern. After they accept the challenge they head down into the caverns, and it all gets boring from there on out. It seems as if they are walking in circles and nothing new seems to happen. There arent even that many ghoul attacks or sightings, just these idiots exploring the repeating cheesy sets. If you're looking for gore or cool death scenes GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! No one dies during the whole movie accept for at the end. If you want to sit through an hour and a half of bad dubbing and terrible one liners pick this one up."
3,Graveyard Disturbance ?,"This film is not even very enjoyable for those who like ""bad movies"". I thought it was inconsequential, unimportant and poor. The camera work alone has that negligible TV look to it and I had to take my eyes off the screen every 5 minutes.So, there are some rituals going on in the catacombs."
4,The Race for the Moon,"I bought this documentary, because a journalist in an Australian newspaper articule raved about it. It was very interesting, but it wasn't spectular. I prefered ""From the Earth to the Moon"" and ""Apollo 13""."
4,"Great, but not the definitive take on Apollo","In 'Shadow' you get to hear voices that are infrequently heard from in other Apollo films: Collins, Scott, Schmidtt, Mitchell. This a pleasant surprise.Michael Collins, Al Bean and Charlie Duke really carry this movie. Their candor and humor bring a humanity to the film. John Young, Edgar Mitchell and David Scott also evoke emotional responses but in a vastly more subtle and understated manner. I could have done without Aldrin and Cernan, both of who continue to exhibit tremendous self-regard all these decades.A very personal film that is a worthwhile collection to any space buff's library. Also, it is a good movie for those who did not live thru that era but wish understand some of the men inside those machines."
5,Great documentarty of the epic journey into space and the moon,"Very well done documentary of mankind's momentous accomplishment the journey to the moon and of overcoming unprecedented technical challenges, with interviews of the participants, archival and re-shot footage. An effort of this magnitude and technical innovation would have won WWII two years sooner. The revue of background politics in overcoming technical challenges, getting approvals and shifting blame for disasters was fascinating and insightful."
3,Pale shadow of FOR ALL MANKIND,"It is always interesting to hear the Apollo astronauts talk about their adventures, but this film suffers in the pacing department -- too many exaggerated slo-mos of Saturn V rockets taking off, and things of that nature. The moon flights had their own grandeur without the cinematic pumping. This film is a pale shadow of Al Reinert's FOR ALL MANKIND."
2,Save your money.,Buy the Right Stuff or From the Earth to the Moon. This is a shallow copy of those movies.
5,"A Beautifully Made Documentary, Told by Apollo Astronauts","The filmmaker lets the astronauts describe in their own words the times & places surrounding the vast Apollo accomplishment. Their comments on the meaning of the Apollo program are eloquent & thoughtful, and their insights captured in this film greatly exceed what NASA or TV talking heads have ever provided. You will not be disappointed.The film beautifully intertwines the astronauts (now mostly in their 60s or older) with stunning footage from the actual missions. The mission films are simply marvelous, especially video taken by engineering cameras that has mostly never been seen. BTW...To get an equally excellent perspective of the Apollo program, but more oriented toward the mission films with off-camera comments by the astronauts, also watch the outstandingFor All Mankind (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray] documentary."
5,EXTREMELY ENTERTAINING!,"TO WATCH AND HEAR THE ASTRONAUTS PERSPECTIVE REFLECTING ON THEIR BRAVE AND DEDICATED EFFORT TO PROPELL US TO THE MOON AHEAD OF THE RUSSIANS. AN EXTREMELY HUMBLING ACCOUNT OF THEIR JOURNIES. AWESOME BONUS FEATURES AS WELL. A REAL MUST FOR ANYONE REMOTELY INTERESTED IN THE MOST AMAZING FEET THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOW, OUR TRIPS TO THE MOON AND BACK."
5,Fascinating,I bought this for our grandkids to watch in the car and find that we adults like it too.
5,watching with James,I watched all these events in my thirties and wondered what my 8 year old grandson James would make of it.He is into any space type programmes but his response to this showed in real excitement and awe.It also made me relive the time and I felt after the film as i did 40 years ago if I was not a Brit I would settle for being an American What real Supermen!
5,must see!!,"I think this is a unique film, bringing together all these people in one show and hearing their testimonies. I was especially hit by some of the comments of the astronauts, things that one does not think about immediately, like 'we were the only two guys on this entire huge place' and the fact that one can hide the Earth behind one's thumb, every thing you love, all our troubles, wars, behind your thumb. A must-see and unique piece of work, with good photography."
2,drab,for a 5xl thy was vary small other then that every thing was okUltra Force Olive Drab BDU Pants-5XL 7834
4,A most desirable md,Good book with nicely developed story. Some loose ends as the story concludes. Main characters need to get involved in therapy to work out their issues. Something bordering on abusive and controlling about the hero.
1,Yeah not so much...,Washed them once (before using) and now they look really old. They have loose threads hanging out in several places and have small balls all over them. I am not impressed. Would not buy again.
2,not what I expected,"oversized is a big word for these towels and the quality of the cotton used is very low. I washed them once and they already shrank. What is worse is that they keep loosing pieces of cotton. After I dry with them, I have to spend 5 minutes getting rid of cotton bits stuck on my skin. Definitely a disappointing product even for its low price"
4,Rode NTK,"The product has good quality, gets in good condition and its worth its price. If you want to get a home studio go for this mic."
3,Way too short1,I have 4 year old twin girl and while they like this movie it is too short compared to the other Dora dvds we have bought for the same price. It only has the Christmas episode and nothing more.
5,Awesome!!! Taught my son not to take his sisters new toys away!!,We always have issues with my son taking his twin sisters toys away so now we tell him not to swipe her toys and he totally gets it! The best Dora yet!
3,Good for kids,My daughter loves Dora and during the holidays she likes to watch the special themed shows. This one had a lot of singing which she likes she watched 2-3 times in one day so that is a win in my book.
5,Best,I love it. My heart shone with pride when I saw my daughters face when she saw her DVD. Its just what my little girl wanted and we have no boring moments now.
4,Dora,Loved it just about played through without loadingMy son loves Dora and he does not like to wait for vid loads. We look forward to rental again and hope for a another great playback.
2,Ok video,"The story is about the main character Swiper, a bad fox who likes to steal things. The message is if he can be good for a day Santa will forgive him and bring his presents. First, I have an issue with his name. It's too PC. Instead of saying stealing is bad they say be good and you will get presents. Just a poorly told story with a mixed message."
5,"If you love Dora, get this","If you are a Dora fan, this is a must. My child loves Dora and I, as an adult, even rate this as one of the best Christmas movies. The format is similar to any TV Dora episode, except more drawn out. The story focuses on helping Swiper turn good for Christmas with the help of Dora. My child is 3 years old and this movie really impressed upon him not to get on the naughty list like Swiper."
1,Only contains one episode,"This is a double-length feature, and well-done. However, it is only this one episode, instead of the usual four, or in the case of double-length features, 2 bonus regular length episodes are included. The normal fee for 4 episodes (or 1 long and 2 shorts) seems to be in place though, and hence the reason for my low rating.Wait for your library to get this one instead of purchasing it; not a good deal at all, IMHO."
2,"OK, not the best","Basically, if you're buying this album you're getting it for the quirkiness. Hearing M. Doughty attempt ""Funky Town"" is hysterical and darn near worth the price of this album alone. A couple of the Amsterdam recordings are great. But overall this is a bit of a disappointment compared, to, say, the New York concert. The audio quality is rather mediocre and the El Oso material in general sounds rather unpolished, not exactly in a good way.Heck, it's still Soul Coughing and the songs are great. But this release isn't the best example of that."
4,Interesting and Compelling,"This book is an interesting, yet honest look at the life of Babe Didrikson Zaharias. There are parts of the book that are necessarily a bit dry, e.g., the explanation of how and why she tried to regain her amateur status after playing as a professional. Most of the book, however, does an excellent job of getting the reader to feel her seemingly boundless energy and determination. It also does a good job of portraying the limitations of the era on female athletes. It doesn't make them into tragedies, but it does point out that they were more ""hurdles"" that Babe had to overcome.For those interested in biographies of famous women, this book and Freedman's book about Eleanor Roosevelt are both excellent additions to the young adult library."
1,Very Disappointed,The trailer showed to be in english and it was in a different language. waiste of money!!! I don't recommend it.
3,ok,was good but was expecting more action would not watch again like the fact that they explained things that had me thinkin
4,First Squad,"very interesting premise for an anime, i wish this was more along the lines of a series. for what is here it is very good but a lot more back story would go a long way to make it great."
5,brake line,"very reasonable price, and fast delivery. good packaginggood OEM quality product,took awhile to find the right item.Oddly enough I found literally hundred of links to a brake line for the passenger side of the vehiclebut not for the driver side. Is there a history of the passenger side brake line failure on Ford crown victorias's?"
2,"Very irritating heroine, slightly redeemed at the end","As someone else said, the heroine in this book is incredibly irritating. I wanted to smack some sense into her for the majority of the book. The last 30 pages or so were much better, but the book can't be redeemed by that. I'm just glad that I didn't pay for this one."
2,Annoying Drama Queen,Drama-Queen indeed !!! How on earth can you settle in a town like Santa Barbara (I lived there) without having any money??? And then knowingly go out and try to buy a car with a heavily indebted credit-card?? Duh !!! The main character was annoying and overdrawn and like every other page I wanted to slap some sense into her!!! I'm annoyed that i actually spend some money on this book....
5,Don't read this book--,"--in public!You'll embarrass yourself by laughing out loud. This is the funniest chicklit book I've ever read. It sneaks up on you, you're reading along, having a nice time, and suddenly you burst out laughing.This is nothing but pure pleasure. If you want a serious book, don't buy this! If you want angst and tragic romance, forget it. But if you want a silly, outrageous, incredibly funny romp, you MUST read this book! It's fast, it's funny, and it's fabulous."
5,Get ready to laugh out loud.....literally!,"This book was beyond hilarious. In the beginning I found myself not liking the main character and hoping that wasn't going to be the way she stayed thorughout the book. Slowly, though, I found myself loving this character. She slowly evolves through this very fast paced book.I could not put this book down. The chapters are very short which I love because that is always my stopping point.I very rarely laugh out loud while reading, but I found myself doing it often in this book and even going back and re-reading a portion just to laugh again. Especially the condom story with Merrick, the trolley toilet accident (with Merrick again) and her talking about her poor dog, Scab...oh wait, I mean Mui Mui. Get this book, you won't be dissapointed."
5,never a let down,"This is the first chick lit book by Lee Nichols. I read this right after it came out.I'm always a little hesistant when starting to read a book by a new author. I'll never know if I like the writing style or if I'm able to relate to the characters in any way. If I can't relate to them, then I have a very hard time finishing the book.Well, let me tell you, I was not let down. Lee Nichols immediately became one of my favorite authors after reading this book.You won't be let down at all by this one if you choose to pick it up.And of course, if you love this book you must read her second book Hand Me Down."
4,Totally laugh out loud funny,"Contrary to another reviewer's statements, I found the first 2/3 of this book to be side splitting, laugh out loud funny, and only slightly lost interest when Elle went from being outrageous to being, well, ordinary. The condom-balloon fight with her elderly landlord, the sewage mishap, and the Miss Cleo connection were hilariously funny. Elle finds herself in one disaster after another yet she always keeps her sense of humor. Lee Nichols created a character with a great spirit, for whom you root despite her impulsive, unbelievable behavior. I can't wait for her next novel."
5,Best from the Chick Lit books,"I rarely give books 5 stars, but this was the most enjoyable read I remember in years. This is the rare find that makes you look forward to reading time: a hilarious page-turner about the antics and incredibly bad luck of a single girl with a short list to fulfill. All she wants is a job, an apartment, and a man....how that can be so tough? As any single, unemployed girl knows, it's a struggle. We can only laugh at Elle because she is not actually one of our closest friends. If these events happened to anyone I knew I would tell her to write a book about it!"
5,Great case for PSP,"This is a great case. It is made of tough, but flexible ballistic-type fabric. The compartment for the PSP fits it perfectly -- snug enough to keep it firmly in place, but not so tight that it is hard to get the PSP in and out. It has a fuzzy lining to protect the screen. The middle section has room for lots of UMDs (probably more than there are, at the present time), and there is an extra outer pocket that is just right for a PDA or cell phone (my Dell Axim fits this pocket). The case has a flat belt loop plus a cord loop, so you could attach it to a lift ticket D-ring on your ski jacket or hang it from a nail (probably not a good idea, but who knows? It might come in handy some time.)"
4,A Little Disappointing,"Looking for an all-in-one case for my PSP, I stumbled across this one, and after reading the mostly excellent reviews for it, I decided to buy it. When it got here, it was a little disappointed. It's rather small, and everything seems to fit a little tightly. Everything fits, but it's rather snug. It's well worth the $10 investment though, if only for the fact that it can hold 16 UMDs. I recommend this case to anyone with lots of UMDs to carry."
5,PSP,"Nice Case! Its very sturdy. Fits charger, games, psp and has space left for a few extras. Not too bulky. Just right for airplane travel."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed that this case could not house the psp while it was in the hard case that I'd also bought. I like the hard case because it offers extra protection for the psp itself, and I wanted to be able to carry it around in this case so that the games and the psp can be in a ""carry all"". Unfortunately, the psp in it's hard case cannot fit into this carry bag. I'd ordered two, and ended up returning one. The other is not being used at all, but since we took it out of its original packaging, I did not return both."
2,Not very good!,"I love her other records, but this one's mixed badly, seems like weak songs, and not worth buying. What a disappointment after hearing it DID exist. Ah well, get the other records, the outtakes, the BBC and maybe this one at the very last, if you have to...."
3,Good book with bad tech support,"The book is fine; the tech support on the book's XSLT editor is awful. The tool was compiled against an ancient (2002) Java VM, and doesn't work on any current PC. The tech support staff have ignored the problem for three weeks, so I'll find another editor"
3,"good book, iffy subject","This is a well written book that is far above the typical quickie celebrity bios that you buy in the grocery store. The only qualm I have, is the subject. George Clooney is still rather early in his career. He's handsome and has made good decisions in picking movie parts but this isn't Clark Gable or Gary Cooper. He still has a long way to go before deserving the legend treatment that he gets from this book. Still, if you love George buy this book as a treat to yourself."
5,morphine foundation,this CD-as with all morphine cd's- needs to be listened to repetitively.It just grows and grows - more blues oriented than morphine but just as addictive. Sandman's lyrics and music are a direct link to beat generation and jazz/blues.Kool personified. A giant of a song writer- completely unique individual and a generous musician. we are lucky to have these recordings.
4,Review of Music and Shipper,"As a Morphine fan, this 2 CD and 1 DVD set is well worth it. The DVD is the weakest part of the set.Concerning the shipper, they took longer than expected to ship."
5,Phenomenal!,"If you are any sort of fan of Mark Sandman, Morphine or Treat her Right you MUST own this!"
1,Returned this hairbrush,"because was completely disappointed. The nylon quills of the brush are not only very scratchy (being square and not rounded) but also of different length, so that when you try to brush only the longest ones actually touch your scalp and the others don't. Maybe I got a defective brush, but I tried to contact Marylin brushes and never got a response, so don't even want to waste time trying."
2,This book is entertainment,"This book begins entirely entertaining, then levels off after the middle chapters. Each chapter is one page, that can be read in about 60 seconds, and lays out the author's view on a particular modern scientific topic.I really enjoyed some of the historical vignettes on famous, and not so famous scientists.I keep this book in that special room that one tends to visit once a day for a two to three minute period of time. I secretly think that is the author's intent for where the audience should read the book.Worth the buy at a discount price."
1,Don't fall into the 'complete idiot' trap!,"I have to admit, I did. I have two on Italy & they were both a complete waste of time & money. The idea is appealing--history & culture told in a fun, easy-to-digest way--but the authors do not have enough experience or knowledge to pull it off. If you're even slightly interested in Italy-don't bother. The book is filled with inaccuracies, typos, and half truths."
2,Trivial information only.,"I purchased this book to gain more information about Italian culture and history in general and to plan a trip to Italy as well. The ""Idiots"" guide is properly titled since its information in trite and common and I found the book to be pretty useless. Many other books on the subject are much better."
1,You'd have to be an idiot...,to think this book has anything to say--it's a bunch of info cobbled together from the usual guide books..I should've chucked it when I saw the italian grammar error in the table of contents!!! A complete waste of money...
2,Trival and common information,"I purchased this book to gain more information about Italian culture and history in general and to plan a trip to Italy as well. The ""Idiots"" guide is properly titled since its information in trite and common and I found the book to be pretty useless. Many other books on the subject are much better."
5,Un grande primo piatto,"For those who know little or nothing of Italian history and culture, this is a great starting place, with tidbits galore of information about people, places, and things Italian. Even for those who have an extensive knowledge of Italian culture and history, this book still offers much information for the trivia inclined.A grand portrait is painted of Italy and her music, history, culture, art, politics, wars, religion, food, women, inventors, discoverers, language, architecture, Papacy, banking, commerce, philosophies, unification, immigration, myths and magic, theater, clothing, and more.Some added touches includes appendixes with a glossary of commonly used Italian words, web resources, and suggested films and books. The index is very good."
1,Very Poor Job on Italian heritage and culture,There are many other books so much better than this one to choose from. Search Amazon for Italian heritage or Italian culture. Pick a book not written for an idiot. This one is way too trivial in its content and you will learn almost nothing.
5,Italian History Made Fun,"I loved reading Ms. Euvino's book on Italian history and culture. She has a unique writing style that held my attention all the way through.The book gave me a real introduction to people I am fascinated by like Leornardo Da Vinci and Christopher Columbus. The author has such a firm grasp on the subject matter that she makes the passages easy to understand. I particularly like the catchy section headings like ""Strange Bedfellows"" and ""Starving Artist.""Overall, the book is a very entertaining and enjoyable read. I recommend it.Rob"
4,A New Blend of Contemporary Folk Music,"I recently purchased and then listened to each song on this very good CD. When you usually think of Folk Music, you think of acoustic guitars as the main instrument. While there is some fine guitar playing on each track, the use of fiddle and mandolin over top of electric Jazz bass and light percussion really stands out and makes Oliver Creak a unique sounding band.Each track reflects a different style of music. There are elements of Jazz, Country, Blues, Pop and even a few darker Gothic influences.I am very impressed with this debut CD of Oliver Creak.Thank you"
3,Big dissapointment....,"I remember getting my VHS copy of ""Through The Eyes Of The Dead"" in the mail when it first came out. I remember running up to my room and putting the movie in the VCR. And I remember how very dissapointent I was. May be I had too many high expectations. But whenever Necrophagia said they were going to release the most ""sickest, blasphemous, most goriest"" music home video ever, I was expecting exactly what they said, but like I said I had too many high expectations. The problem? Too many shots of the band bashing out music and not enough of the actual movie itslef. Not to mention the very kiddie-ish gore and attempt at a Satanic ritual. Wayne Farba does do an excellent job in masturbating over a dead hacked-up corpse, and then that goes down hill when Phil Anselmo makes a [fool] of himself at TRYING to act high from sniffing glue. Overall, really dissapointing film."
3,"Good music video's, not enough filler.","For those of you who don't know, Phil Anselmo from Pantera plays in this band as the guitarist under the alias of Anton Crowley. The video is good, the music video's for the songs put a good message through and are quite gruesome. There are not enough interviews with the members, however. I bought this video expecting Necrophagia to voice their points of views on the music scene and such, but very little of that is done. It is, however very well worth the 10 dollars I paid, and I would buy it again even after seeing it."
1,Poor representation of item,"Picture of item shown is no longer available.Received replacement item that worked,but not as good as item in picture.They need to keep picture of item up to date."
1,an extremely poorly written text.,"I used this textbook for a course in VLSI. Never have I read a book in its second edition with so many errors, in addition to such an unclear presentation of material. There are huge swaths of important material on physical characteristics of semiconductors that is either missing or wrong. I would not recommend this book for use in a course in VLSI. Instead, I would recommend Jan Rabaey's text as a much better alternative."
1,VERY unclear and confusing!!,"This book is very poorly written, unclear, and confusing! It skips a whole lot of steps in every example it provides, pulling numbers, measurements, and dimensions out of thin air, without explaining where they came from. Even worse, it does not bother to explain the steps it is following, just a bunch of formulas with no explaination as to where they came from or where the numbers came from.I strongly recommend that you DO NOT buy this book!"
2,Another gossip rag,"I've loved Jeannette Walls's books, ""The Glass Castle"" and ""Half-Broke Horses"" so I bought this one.It's simply another of the gossip rags that she exposes in her book. I found it so distasteful I had to put it down."
3,Dish,"I did not get into this book as I had her 2 previous books...GLASS CASTLE and HALFBROKE HORSES. I really despise gossip and news reporters in general so in all fairness, I did not read more than half the book and passed it on. But I would like to recommend her other 2 books which I enjoyed to the extent I could not put them down."
4,Review of the book DISH,"Dish by Jeannette Walls is an interesting look at scandal sheets (rags) &how even though you were ashamed to look in their direction at one time havenow become more where America is at rather than news items. I understandthe slow transition into ""dirt"" but wonder why we care more about who's onAmerican Idol, who is sleeping with who, instead of where the country is headed.Sadly the trend seems to be to bury our heads in the sand & watch Jon & Kate plus8 divorce."
1,Don't bother.,"This book is just as gossipy as the subject matter it describes. I found it to be boring. and not worth reading, unless you are a big fan of National Enquirer etc."
4,DISH,"This was an interesing read, not gossipy but informative. She's an exceptional writer. Her bios were wonderful and this is just another side, very well investigated."
2,Strong and not to my taste,Ok so two stars... Lets preface this- I didn't like ANY of the scents at all. So there it is. I thought they all smelled like 'cheap' and beyond that were just not to my taste.Having said that... these ARE to some ppl's tastes and as such would probably represent a reasonable value.They are really strong smelling though- much stronger than most fragrances which is good or bad depending on your standpoint.I also did not like the extra shipping charge- although that is clearly laid out when you order. All in all I don't think these represent a good value. It also was not to my taste but that's a subjective thing.
5,Very easy to use and great results!,"This was the easiest wall border I have ever used. The backing came off smoothly as I lined it up along the wall; and when I did need to make an adjustment, it peeled off very nicely and then stuck right back on where I wanted it to.The picture is really cool too. I am doing a 'surfer' room for my boys and this was perfect!!"
1,Don't bother,"The attachment barely has any suction, not enough to extract solution from the carpet. The bare floor tool keeps falling off. The company ""solved"" the problem by sending out a bottle of soap and a new bare floor tool which also keeps falling off. If you really want a Bissell product, there is a Quicksteamer available for half the price. It doesn't have the useless attachment and bare floor tool. If they don't work, why pay for them?"
2,Dont get me wrong....,"First let me say that I love Godzilla and these films are some of the best . What I am annoyed with is the lack of a subtitles option . Why put these films on DVD and leave out this option ? OK I know that most people grew up and loved the awful dubbing, but for those of us who rate these films as important celluloid history, this omitance is unforgivable !Give Godzilla the same respect accorded to anime such as 'Ghost in the shell' . And while your at it give us the origional Gojira film alongside the Raymond Burr re-hash . Got that....Good ."
1,Where Is It?,I can't give this CD a review because I have not received it yet. I ordered it over a month ago and I still have not received my order. Perhaps I should write a review about that!

2,Unknown Size,"Be sure you know what size fender this boot fits BEFORE you buy. The only size given is LARGE, a relative term. These were not large enough for my fenders so they're going back. They really should give the diameters and lengths of fenders these boots will fit. Since I couldn't get them on over the fenders, no further review could be made."
