5,Great!,Purchase arrived in timely manner. No problems. No disappointments. Great way to save some cash.
3,"Mixed quality, short bibliographies of women","This book contains a collection of short bibliographies. They were not written for this book. Instead, this is a collection of writings that were originally published elsewhere (e.g., magazines, newspaper articles). The writing quality and depth of background research varies considerably. Some of the descriptions are excellent, with in-depth background, atmosphere, personality, and events. However, most are simple recitations of facts where I found it difficult to become inspired. The women range mostly from 500 years ago to 50 years ago. Interesting selection, nice book."
4,Roadside Ramble,Good overview and enough detail for novice me. I expected better photos. It does get you to a lot of good places and offers a lot of good resources for additional info. The Virginia Division of Mines has a lot of good photos and color graphs that work well with this book.They are free on line.
4,roadside Va,"The book was worn, as advertised, but not stained or missing pages. I will enjoy using the book this Fall as I travel."
1,The Photographer: Edward Weston,"Received DVD. When I tried to play it, my DVD player/recorder stated it could not be played. Received my purchase price in refund."
2,Too slow...takes for ever to pump out the oil.,"While the product was rated high by others, I have not experienced the same results. After heating the engine oil, it will take an hour to pump out the oil from my 55 hp volvo's. It just should not take this long!"
1,A waste of money,"It never worked right out of the box...too many vacuum leaks make this product virtually worthless. I epoxied every fitting/joints to seal them. Once the leaks were fixed, it worked good for 2 oil changes (took a good 10-12 minutes to drain 10 quarts of diesel oil) then the diaphragm pump failed.I ended up replacing it with a 6 gallon oil changer unit from Harbor Freight that is powered by compressed air from my air compressor. Works much better.I would not recommend this product to anyone. If anyone needs what's left of my Jabsco for parts, just holler!"
4,True to Size,i wear a size 7 1/2 shoe and that's what i got in these and they fit perfect. they also look better in person then in the picture. for 19.99 thay were a great buy.
1,Conflicts with my philosophy,"First of all, I don't think this is a bad book. I was expecting something different, how to raise a child with less focus on TV, sports, and the activity-after-activity world we live in. Instead, it had advice I didn't agree with, due to my own parenting philosophy. For example, the authors suggest that giving your baby a pacifier is like putting duct tape over his/her mouth. I just don't agree with that. After several such passages, I decided this book just isn't for me. I would, however, highly suggest the book ""How Much is Enough."" It's all about how not to overindulge your child, perhaps THE biggest issue I see as a middle school teacher."
2,A Word of Caution,"A word of caution about this book...I read it around the time my son turned one, and implemented some of the ideas about ""down time"" for him, allowing him to play on his own, etc. He was very good at playing alone...too good for a one-year-old. Around age 2, he was diagnosed with autism. Now, in no way am I implying that the book's suggestions somehow led to the diagnosis, but it was exactly the opposite of what I should have been doing with him during that crucial year, meaning engaging him as much as possible. After having a ""neurotypical"" child the second time around, I realized that most babies and toddlers WANT you to play with them constantly. For the 99% of neurotypical kids out there, the ideas in the book are probably fine, but they are not one size fits all."
4,Refreshing,"As a new mom, I sometimes feel overwhelmed by all the stuff I read. Magazines, the AAP book, the What to Expect series . . . then I look up some things online. You find the answer to what you're looking for, because there are two or more sides to everthing. I have not read Gerber nor want another big thick book.I found Teich's book a quick way to re-focus on what is really important. In just a couple pages, she reminds me to just be there. To be the parent, to be a loving mother, and stop worrying about everything else.I picked this book up at my library because of the title and paperback style. I didn't expect much, but now I am ordering a copy for my friends that are new parents too."
4,A nice philosophy,"Less is best, time is the most important gift you can give your child. Excellent theory - and works best when you start out with your baby so you don't have to backtrack with a toddler who's already yelling, Mine! A refreshing approach to offset the busy, bustling world we live in. Books that compliment this one, and hightly recommended: Gentle Baby Care and The Continuum Concept."
4,"Review of ""Seaside Plants of the Gulf Coast""","This is a well written book and contains decent photographs. It is a good guide for the laymen, but not all that useful for actual field identification."
5,Replacement unit,My whole house fan had a timer that would not count down. Replaced with this unit.We will see how long the timer lasts
3,My sons favorite toy... by far,"My 15 month old son received this Ride-on Mater for his 1st birthday. It was a hit from the minute he got it. He has not had a day or even a playtime pass that he doesn't ""Play with Mater"". So far it has held up to some pretty tough beatings my son has put it through, and the only ""battle wound"" is a torn sticker on Maters rear bar. I would recommend this product to any child around his age group for hours of fun, especially if you love the Cars movie as much as our family does."
3,Wouldn't have read if it wasn't required.,"I had to read this book for a gender studies class. It really was not that great. I definitely wouldn't have read it for leisure. It's depressing and not anything inspiring to women who are looking to break out of the ""homeworker"" stereotypes. Give it a chance if you want, but I won't be reading it again."
1,WARNING RE THIS DVD per Annie Haslam's website,"[...]Renaissance DVD Faulty, DO NOT Purchase.Sadly, the first 'Renaissance' DVD was released to the public as a faulty product. The company, Cherry Red Records, is working on correcting the problem.Please do not purchase the DVD until we give the go ahead.If yours is faulty, please contact Cherry Red directly. Contact information will be on your copy.Renaissance assumes no responsibility for this, as it was out of their hands. They are very upset this has happened and are sad about the disappointment felt by many fans."""
3,"Good content, quality poor","Enjoyed watching the band, however the video and audio quality is poor. It looks like it was recorded with a 1070's vintage B/W home video camera."
2,"Disappointing, but I guess this all there is","I'm a big Renaissance fan and saw them live in concert in the late '70's. I was really looking forward to this DVD. Sadly, the video and audio are both awful, so if you're looking forward to experiencing the band in concert, that's not what you're purchasing. What you do get is a blurry black and white video showing the band playing a good couple of sets. There are 2 concerts - one from 1976 (8 songs), the other 1979 (9 songs). The former is the best material and the best quality.On the plus side, the performances are great, and the camera work isn't bad. So it's a very good historic record. If you plan to watch this on a 19"" low def TV using the TV's speakers, I imagine it will be quite satisfactory except for the fact it's in black and white. I'm watching in a home theater with 10' hi def projection system and 5.1 surround audio, so all of the flaws are acute."
4,a Song Name,"I recently watched the movie a few days back, an there is a really stunning song in the movie, which is not on the soundtrack, plus i cant seem to find it anywhere, its the part wheres hes in the speedboat speeding towards the bridge an the song is still playing as he crashes the boat onto the cars, an the music gets louder as you see the car burst into flames on the bridge, ive have tried everywhere an cannot find it, any help would be glorious, thanks in advancePoseidon"
4,Where is BOND???,I just watched this movie and loved it more than the first one even. The music is great and really fits the action. I have one complaint about the soundtrack CD though...WHY weren't the 3 ladies playing the violins included on it? That was the coolest thing and the music rocked! I was going to buy the CD just for that song alone! Whoever left this beautiful tune off this CD made a HUGE MISTAKE.
3,Not Bad But Heard Better,"What are you all talkin bout kids? Best Soundtrack? I'll Admit This soundtrack Rocks. I did like the first XXX CD with 1 rap and 1 rock cd. I like the mixin up. Korn/Xzibit, Bone Crusher/3Days , and POD Tracks take it home. Cube is on a different level. I can't get enough. Most talented HipHop Artist of all Time. ALTHOUGH, lets recall a soundtrack back in the day that took the prize. If ya don't know get it. Judgement Night Soundtrack from the early 90's mixed it all up! All Rap/Rock Tracks. Onyx/Biohazard, House of Pain/Helmet, IceT/Slayer and Cypress Hill/Pearl Jam to name a few. I like to see it comin' back,Thrown Under a Bus.Ice"
4,Who performed the music during the cocktail party?,"The group included several (three?) women playing electric violins, and the music sounded sort of a cross between rock and classical-ish. It doesn't seem to be on the soundtrack CD, based on the samples I heard. Thanks, --Doug (doug@jensen.org)"
4,"Didn't think it fit, but after pounding with rubber hammer it works fine","Received the part with no instructions and found that the inside of the shaft seemed to short to slide all the way down, but after reading another review who said they used a rubber hammer to seat it I did the same. Took some serious pounding but it got seated and everything works fine again."
2,cusinart food processor sheath,"This product did not fit as described. talking to Cusinart, they said they have not made part like this for long time and it is better to buy new cusinart rather than try this after market product."
1,do not buy this,"According to all parties I have contacted, Cuisinart has not made this part for a very long time. Further, no installation instructions are found and are not available anywhere."
1,looks nothing like the picture,Very thin and ugly brown color. Looks nothing like the picture here. The colors are all brown. Need a rug pad because its so thin too.
2,Cheap and thin,Well you get what you pay for in this item and I should have known better. The rug was very thin hard and slippery but I still like the pattern.
4,not bad for the price,"We bought 4 of these in different sizes. They all well matched for color despite coming from different batches. They are THIN, but if you buy the padded backing for area rugs they are acceptable. They are very inexpensive, incredibly so for what you get. Just don't expect a perfect, high end rug because these are not it, however, they are a GREAT value."
4,Addictive. . . .,I first purchased a package of these dried cranberries just a few weeks ago (after having just enjoyed cranberries in the salad at a restaurant). It has rapidly become a staple in the family diet. All three of us really enjoy just munching them plain or--even more--as an element in our green salads.Dried cranberries in a salad add a nice tolerable sweetness and a different texture than just the green vegetables that we incorporate into the salad.I suspect that we will continue to use this for some time to come. And we may also experiment with other dried fruits as a component of our salads.Worth takjing a look at if you like fruits in your salads.
3,Interesting but not what I was expecting,"While I found this book to be an interesting read and perhaps captures what it was like for a typical young man to grow up in Indiana (like I did) and be a basketball player (like I wasn't), it wasn't what I was expecting when I bought it. The title led me to believe I would read more about the Big Picture -- what Hoosier Hysteria was (is) and how it has affected the Indiana population as a whole over the years. Instead it was mainly about the author and his personal journey playing high school and college basketball. I enjoy memoirs, but I think the word ""memoir"" in the title or subtitle would have helped me understand what I was ordering. I do praise the author for his insight into racism in the state -- and in Hoosier basketball in particular; I learned a lot from this book about that sorry history. Those who like this book might also enjoy reading ""Getting Open"" by Tom Graham."
4,good belt,purchased this belt about 1 month ago for my 2001 Dodge Ram so far so good this belt replaced a dayco belt that was only 6 months old but made a terrible squealing noise
4,Affordable Home Theater System,"The Aiwa XS-DS70 is a great home theater system for those looking to get into the market. The sound is nice and clear, and can be really pumped up when playing videogames or DVD's on the player. The drawback of the system is it seem to sound pretty weak when playing cd's on it. If you're looking for a system that is compact enough to fit into a small room, but still offers a great deal of sound, I'd reccomend this Aiwa product."
2,great if it works,"I got a weber for my Mazda B2200 and put this in to throttle down the electric fuel pump. The first one I got would not let ""any"" gas past regardless of the setting. I send it back, got another one (and this time a gauge) and it was off in its pressure setting about +3 PSI. So...I got one at a local store which was cheaper than shipping this one back, it works good (withing .5 PSI) and sofar after a year I have not had any issues.Guess 3 times the charm. My 2 cents, buy this locally, it may cost a few more bucks, but if you have to return it, its alot easier. And you car is not down while waiting for the new one."
3,Old lady's experience,"I was scheduled to have foot surgery and started practicing with ordinary crutches. It was clear that I would not have good enough balance on them to go up and down stairs. The iWALKfree looked like a solution, so I bought one (used, elsewhere).I am a fairly mobile 70 year old woman. My fitness and balance is no better than average among my peers (which isn't very good). I practiced with this device using a railing for stability. But my balance was thrown off by the weight of the device, and I never did the hang of it.Also, removing the straps with just one hand is very difficult. But to reach the strap on my leg, I had to twist more than my body likes in order to reach the strap with my second hand.I think this is a very clever solution for people who are a bit younger and/or a bit fitter than I am.Fortunately, I got enough foot pain improvement from better shoes that I was able to cancel the surgery."
1,Great Movie... Disappointing sound track,"If you enjoy sound tracks with american history themes ( Legend of the Fall; Patriot; Last of the Mohicans; Dances with Wolves; etc) this one will be a real disappointment.While the movie was inspiring, the sound track is like listening to a never ending dirge. Little variance in theme or tempo, each cut is predictable... it sounds exactly like the one prior to it."
2,I can't belive it!,How can everybody give this CD 5 stars? This can't be true! I bought It because this ridiculous reviews! After 2 listening I got a nightmare one night! I couldn't stop playing this music in my dreams ! It was horrible! This is not Horner's best. Horner's best is Breavehart (Thank you James for that!) - But not this - this music is annoying big time! - like Terminator 2 -
5,"Emotional Soundtrack, just like the movie",This movie wouldn't have been nearly as emotional without this score. James Horner has really outdone himself on this one. The boys choir is amazing and it brings the movie back into your mind when you hear it. Wonderful! That's all I can say.
5,Best of Horner,"Even with the success of Braveheart, Apollo 13, and Titanic, I have to say this is still the best of Horner's work. Unlike most soundtracks, you'll actually be able to listen to most of the songs here. His rendition of the Carmia Burana piece O Fortuna, alone, makes the CD worth buying. And the main title is a masterpiece. --Mark LaLena"
4,A must have Soundtrack,This soundtrack has an awesome choir sound from an awesome composer! This is yet another good soundtrack I would recommend!
4,"Good ""Intentions""...","First off the name of the band is ""Granny's Intentions.""According to what I've read of the band, Gary Moore was not officially a member, though he was hired by the band to finish recording the album and appears on the majority of the tracks. The album was released by Deram in 1970 and the band pretty much called it quits after that.As for the music, it's good but not great; they play a mixture of blues, country, folk, rock and even some jazz. A lot have likened their sound to the Band and Traffic, and they do have elements of these bands, but not to the extent that fans of these bands would hope for. Lead singer Johny Duhan has a good but raw voice and Gary Moore, who was only 17, doesn't quite have his blues-guitar hero chops yet, but he does play a very servicable lead. It's good late-sixties, ""homespun"" Rock, that while not necessarily essential to your collection, is still a good pick up.Some of the highlights are ""Maybe,"" ""Susan of the Country"" and ""Fourthskin Blues."""
3,His life as a education tsar,"It is not a biography but rather as the title says, his dilemmas in life and decisions he had to make during his life. I wonder how he found the time to be everywhere for everybody. It starts quickly with quanta idea and that goes into the administrative acts, institutions, academies he established and became a director. His dilemmas during the Nazi regime and his hopes that eventually people will come to right way and considerations that these are transitional times. Meanwhile it looks like he was willing to separate people into groups valuable and worthless, interesting, no wonder Einstein never forgave him. I did not find the book fluent. It was jumping all over with a lot of institution names and dates and persons, sort of broken in pieces."
1,Avoid,"I had rented this once before and turned it off about 30 mins in, today I gave it a second chance thinking maybe I was not in the mood for it or possibly just having a bad day. Well my initial feeling was correct (although I made myself sit through the whole thing) To begin with the audio is terribly glitchy which in it self makes the movie almost unwatchable. If that doesn't get you the acting and script will, I use acting very liberally because it seems like the actors are uncomfortable reading lines off cue cards. The script is for lack of a better word, bad. I understand it is not a documentary and should not expect many views of the trail it's self but throw a dog at least one bone. All in all, I would say avoid this movie."
1,Unwatchable,"I wish I could give this less than one star. The acting is horrible, the plot is contrived, and the audio glitches non-stop. The directing quality is also sub-par. I've seen high schoolers make better movies than this. I wanted to shut it off half-way through, but since I'm worried others will pay for it as I did, I wanted to write a review, and I wanted to have seen the whole thing to be fair. Don't waste your time on this one."
2,Not very good movie on the AT,"While the filming and cinematography of this movie was outstanding, though the content was not too good.First of all, gave one the impression that AT thru hikers are all a bunch of liberal hippie dope smoking types. Form my expereiences of hiking the AT, this is the minority.Plus did not care for seeing some the main character Olivia flashing here fat white butt in a mooning scene and walking naked down the trail.Not very good DVD. Makes on want to hike elsewhere."
3,Southbounders,was a nice independent movie a movie about. thru hike on the Appalachian Trail 3 people trying to find themselves
2,OK movie; quality poor,"The movie was OK. There could have been more about the AT, but overall OK. The quality of the download was pretty poor; the sound was off in several places through the whole movie. Very annoying."
3,Great wilderness views and lots of history,"I would have rated this a 4 but the movie glitches constantly. Over all it was a great movie with lots of wilderness and history. I was on the Appalachian trail while in North Carolina, it was a kick to see history and be able to walk that trail, if only for a short while. Well worth the watching, especially if you love nature or are a history buff."
3,Good Beginners Guide for Students,"This is a workbook for journalism students, teaching the basics of print journalism. It is an excellent textbook for classroom or diligent home study--but it is not a fun, at home read."
5,"Dreaming in America, Easy A","This is a great look into the constant touring life of one of my favorite bands, Lucero. The amazingly authentic footage of their live performances really gives a great perspective on lead singer Ben Nichols. The great music is a huge plus."
1,Not happy!,"I'm really disappointed with this purchase. I thought the ring looked beautiful online but when it arrived it's in person appearance was much lower quality than the picture indicated - it just looks a bit cheap and tinny. If I'd seen the ring in person, $35-40 is probably the most I'd pay for it. For almost $70, I expected a high quality product even if it was sterling silver and CZs.Still, I wore the ring out and got quite a few compliments on it so would have been inclined to give a more positive rating if one of the smaller fake sapphires didn't fall out THE FIRST DAY I wore the ring. I definitely wouldn't recommend this vendor to anyone nor will I buy from them again - which is really too bad - they have a lot of cute jewelry designs."
4,A Forgotten Classic,"A beautiful film, with what is still some of the most unique art design in cinema. The ""living illustration"" quality of ""Mystimation"" is both charmingly quaint and disarmingly gorgeous. Although the narration is a bit stilted, and the print quality leaves something to be desired, the brilliance of this production shines through, nonetheless. Do yourself a favor and give this film a look."
4,wider view for sun or moon with dslr camera t mount,This is a useful item to widen the field of view for my Olympus E-3 camera t-mount. I have used for both sunspot viewing (using filter on my Celestron SCT-8) and moon shots.
2,Not really worth the money,"Cheaply made---Blue only pops up sometimes. Also, you have to go through 2 cycles of the song before it pops up and even then, it doesn't pop out on the right musical note."
2,very cheaply made!,"My son loves blues clues, and he loved his jack-in-a-box for the one day that it worked! He got it as a Christmas gift, and the next day it already didn't pop up. The cover also bent easily, but the latch that is supposed to release is actually not working. I would not recommend buying it, though it's too bad, because it would be a really cute toy that my son would have loved."
1,Worst toy ive ever bought!!!,I bought this toy for my wife and it broke after just a few minutes of play!
4,One of a kind style,"I bought this album because Leslie West is a great guitarist with his own style. The opening number could have been left out but the CD goes uphill from there and touches heights of sheer brilliance at times. His covers of other songs are good because he has away of putting his own signature on them rather than mimicing the original recordings. If you are a Leslie West fan, buy this album!"
5,The Best...Leslie West,"If you're interested in hearing the latest from an unsung pioneer - and giant - of American hard rock guitar or you're simply a guitar aficionado, this latest outing from West is, simply, a treat. Continuing the foray into blues that he began with '94's ""Dodgin' the Dirt"", the (no longer) Fat Man rips out some standard blues, some new blues, and his trademark riffs and tremolos in this tight, well-produced offering. Old fans will appreciate West's new versions of two signature songs: ""Stormy Monday"" (a blues-rock live jam staple from his Mountain days) done in a more traditional-blues, gravelly-voiced style, and Otis Redding's ""Respect"" which was one of West's first singles with The Vagrants in the 60's. These two, along with ""Dragon Lady"" and ""The Cell"" are by themselves worth the price of admission."
4,The Eagle Flies on Friday,"Fans had to wait three years since ""Mans World"" but Leslie is still growling and playing that PHAT guitar. Highlights here have to be the blues driven numbers ""Stormy Monday"" and ""Dragon lady"". Rock and Roll is Hot and Heavy in ""Tequilla"", ""Raw Nerve"",and a great new prison number called ""The Cell"". Leslie has a number of great musicians credited in the making of this CD, including but not limited to Leo Lyons from TYA, Kim Simmonds from Savoy Brown, and the Deleware Destroyers from George somebody. All in All a Great Rock and Roll CD to be played Loud and Proud. You will want to ""get down on your knees and Pray"" that Leslie will come through your town after hearing his version ""Stormy Monday"". One of the Best Rock and Roll Guitar players in the World."
1,Terrible old battery,"I ordered this direct from Amazon and after 1 week of use (in 3 phones), they will not hold a charge overnight. The package is dated 2005 and I'm past my 30 days to exchange (vacation). Don't waste your money on these.Boo!"
1,LISTEN TO THESE REVIEWS !!!!!!,I also read the reviews and thought welllllll ENERGIZER cant be bad. WRONG !!! Junk batteries. Held a full charge for about 2hrs.Factory battery gave 5 hours PLUS for talk time. Ordered the OEM replacement after checking the base and charger base. They are fine.This battery is GARBAGE.KEEP LOOKING and DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
1,I should have listen!!,"Before getting my new phones this Christmas I had another phone that require this battery. I should have listen to one of the other buyers who stated that the charge does not hold for long. Thank goodness I only brought one of them to test, because this battery was a bit more then I was looking to buy and I have 3 phones. Buying them for all 3 would have ticked me off. Its not worth it."
3,Dean Martin review,"I like a lot of Dean's songs and I really liked the Dean Martin Show. This is not the Dean Martin Show, just clips of him singing and it really wasn't done too well.Got 3 stars because I like Dean and this is about all I could find."
5,Works fine so far...,"I've always used official Dell cartridges, but I decided to try an alternative since they're so expensive (and I go through several cartridges each year). I've been using this one for about 2 weeks and I've been very pleased. It works fine and the difference in print quality is so minimal that I don't believe it would be a concern for most users.Just FYI, the carton it arrived in wasn't as sturdy as the Dell boxes and got a bit banged up in shipping, but the cartridge itself wasn't damaged."
4,dell 1100 toner replacment,the unit arrived well packaged and ready to install.after installation i was slightly disappointed with the clarity of the print.it's just a little lighter than the original but i soon got use to it. the price more than made up for the clarity of print.
4,First prints are good......,"With less than 10 prints made it seems a bit early to judge, but those that have been printed are of good quality. Truth we be in the number of prints made and no telling at this early stage as to that out come."
5,Deeply moving book,"This book is a deeply moving book taking the reader through the chronological events leading to the Kursk disaster, the various rescue tentatives and even the aftermath. This is very well written, meaning this is not dry chronology but you get to know the various characters deeper. The book also offers various perspective - West vs East but also ""fithing man"" up to general. It gives very good technical insights as to what happened within the Kursk, what issues the rescuers were facing. Also offers a view on the geopolitics (how President Putin managed the crisis, the inner Russia's fight between hardliners and progressist). This book does justice to the tremendous courage of the Russian Submariners as well as to the professionalism of the western saturation divers. It will be hard not to carry for a while the sailor's family grief - this is how well this book is written."
3,Review for Holmes-Dracula,Book was not as interesting to read as Loren D Estleman's book of Sherlock Holmes vs Dracula. I had a hard time getting into the one by Fred Saberhagen.
4,Elementary my dear Dracula!,"Before I purchased this book I had already bought Seance for a Vampire. I read that it would be best to read this book first, and I did so - and I was glad I did. I found the novel to be very enjoyable. Fred Saberhagen captured the spirit of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I enjoyed his portrayal of Sherlock Holmes, Watson, Lestrade and Gregson. I also thought Saberhagen's presentation of Dracula was good too. I hope to read The Dracula Tape in the future which would fill me in on some points which I was I unclear about. Due to this book, I definitely have plans to read Seance for Vampire next - Saberhagen's second pairing of Dracula and Holmes."
5,"Haunting story, elegantly told","At times the images are wrenching, but always a page turner. Harmon paints a vivid picture of a young boy coming of age in the rural South. Laced with tender and funny moments, Henry is caught in a battle between his mother's aspirations and his father's history, all the while struggling with his own changing body. Not your typical piece of regional fiction, A House All Stilled is timeless, poignant and elegantly written."
3,Like a taped it off the TV,"This is clearly a made for TV, infomercial style program. I was looking for something more instructional on the proper care of the back for chronic or recurrent back pain.Dr. Pennings"
5,RMF's review,"As a restoration guide, this book is practically useless. Restoration information is extremely basic and general. However, as a source for both data and history relative to the 53 and 54 Starliners, this book is worth every penny of it's high price. Paying $100 for any book galls me, but you will not find a better source of information on the Starliners than this book - so suck it up and pay the price. If you already own a 53/54 Starliner or are seriously thinking of buying one - this book is a must have. The level of detail is exceptional. It's also well written and well illustrated. The author definitely did his homework before/while writing this book. A worthy addition to any Studebaker/Starliner fan's library as well."
5,Human Nature At Its Brightest & Darkest,"Four old, unmarried sisters living in an isolated countryside - hardly an idyllic picture. Their father, a patriarch, had forbidden their contact with the outside world. When he died, his daughters remain trapped, each one jealously hoarding her own memories, which is all that is left to call as her own.A gripping read with great psychological depth."
4,"It's a very accurated figure from V, excellent","It's A very accurate figure from V, excellent product, great material. There's only one thing, it's bigger than 7"", but not too much."
3,"Nice looking display, not fun if you intend to ""play"" with it","When I bought this i got it cause i wanted it for my collection. I thought it was nice because it stood well and looked very nice on my shelf. So in that sense i would give it a Five Star. But If you are purchasing this to play with it, or to give it to a kid to play with then dont even bother. The figure is not very manuverable and is not very fun to play with. He is a very stiff moldable statue basically. So in the sense of playing with it i give it a 1 star."
1,It's almost been a month and the order did not arrive.,"It's almost been a month and the order did not arrive. I have done the payment, and checked out my postbox many times. I dont have the item !"
2,Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08,I purchased this game as a Christmas gift for my husband to replace a faulty game he already had. It turns out it is a glitch in the game itself. After developing his player and amassing wealth and luxuries he gets to a certain point late in the game and can not go any further. Their tech support lines have not been able to assist.
2,"Somewhat helpful, not exactly what I was looking for","Sham Tickoo know a lot about CATIA, but I figured out more just messing around with the program than I did from trying to navigate through his book. The main problem is that there are so many applications for parametric modeling (my interests are in architecture), and Tickoo had to focus on something specific for his examples, which were not related to architecture. I do recommend the book, however, because it helped me overcome problems on several occasion where I was stumped and could not figure out where to go next."
2,Not like the older models,"I mis-placed a 20 year old slide recently, and replaced it with the same model. I note that both were brass, not chrome, despite what Amazon says.It's not as heavy, the edges are not as well-finished, and I swear it's just a touch tighter on my finger ..."
2,not what I was looking for,I was looking for the series that had the bowery boys in the malt shop at the start of each movie. I think this was the later ones. these are good but not what I wanted.
5,Very good book,"This is the first in the series. It is a wonderful book, love those Western Love Stories. It is about a woman named Carla who has been in love with her brother's best Friend Luke since she was a teenager.Now she is all grown up and hasn't seen him since he broke her heart at age 14. She ends up losing a bet and has to work for him on his farm for the whole summer. Trying to resist temptation is not easy and Luke loves her, but keeps trying to push her away by being down right rude. It is interesting to see how much they fight to stay away but seem to not be able to."
5,Even Lowell's older titles are good! A Keeper.,This is the first of the modern western series about the MacKenzie/Blackthorne families. What a treat. You can tell throughout the book that both these characters are in love and want each other. Luke is so torn by his awful childhood he can't take the risk to be happy. Thankfully Carla does! I cried with this one and felt so warm in the end! Lowell is great!
2,its ok,this book is no great shakes. i much prefer ultimate sacrifice and history will not absolve us
2,Very Disappointed,"This CD is all over the place. I can't begin to determine just what style they have or what they are trying to do. Jazz, rock, pop, alternative. Other than ""The Road To Damascus"" This CD is terrible. It's a shame because thses guys are very talented, with good voices, but it's all lost in a bunch of nothing and just when you are ready to throw the CD away, here comes ""The Road To Damascus"". Then you really get angry. If they can make this one very good song, then why couldn't they repeat it?"
2,its good for a short while,"I bought this a while back. It 5 sheets of paper and a template. The paper actually makes your frets shiny and is able to remove rust. But to do so you need ALOT of elbow grease. Each fret takes around 20 seconds of constant polishing to get to the max polish, which isnt very great sometimes. When you restring the guitar you find that the frets are really smooth and great to play. But theres a problem. I use Elixir strings and change strings only every few months. The polish work is gone roughly after 2-3 weeks and the frets start to get scratchy again. This isnt a fret job, only a fret polish, so dont expect your frets to be as good as new after using them. So for fret polishing I wouldnt recommend these, Id say go for some super fine 0000 steel wool, alot faster and easier and does the same job, although a bit more dangerous."
3,OK but limited to light polishing,"I got this at the same time I was ordering a bunch of different stuff to perform maintenance on my guitars. I'd say that this, er, 'system' which consists of polishing cloths and a paper/cardboard template, does what it advertises but will be inadequate if your frets are real bad. There is a well known guy who writes guitar maintenance books, who is with a pretty well known company that sells guitar maintenance products, and they have options for dealing with all aspects of fret leveling and dressing. I now consider this product to be useful for a final 'fine' touch up after having done a fret job, or for polishing frets of an already pretty good looking guitar fretboard."
5,Usborne World of Knowledge Encyclopedia,"Remarkable, there is so much information, you just don't know where to start. The detailed pictures help teach even the youngest of readers. A must for all families."
4,A minor work by Philip Glass,"Philip Glass' output is large, alternating between major pieces, consisting of beautiful new music (The Screens or the Saxophone Quartet Concerto) and minor works. In these minor pieces he recycles ideas from older works - I think Dracula is one of them. It is a good piece for string quartet but there's nothing very original in it. A release of Orphée, the beautiful opera-ballet Les Enfants Terribles or even the new Symphony No.5 would be much more satisfying. Oh my gosh, that's sounds like a bad review! As I said: it's not a bad piece - 'In the Theatre' is a nice movement and 'The Storm' is very dissonant and quite original. Give it a try, it's really not bad at all. (For the people who dismissed Glass' music as 'Is he serious?' or something like that: Try 'The Screens'!)"
4,haunting,"I bought this cd based on curiosity. Having never seen the film, I obviously can't comment on the correspondence between it and this score, but I can say that the creeping gothic mood of the Dracula story is captured effectively here. And the music holds up perfectly well on its own merits. Philip Glass has become quite well-known for his spare compositions, and while this score is not a departure from that style, there is a certain lushness. The Kronos Quartet are clearly extremely talented musicians, somehow managing to make only four instruments sound, at times, like an entire orchestra's string section. There are a few tracks that I imagine work better along with the scenes they are meant to accompany and don't necessarily make for the best plain listening, but these are quite outnumbered by other cues that are nothing less than gorgeous. Absolutely worth a listen."
5,the master of all monster scores,great composer great everything i am soo happy i bought this cd it holds a speacil place in my heart
4,Good read...for cat people only,"If there were a Bible for cats, this book would be included. Cat lovers basically know everything that's in this book, before reading the first page. But can too much be said about man's noblest companion? The dust jacket states this is about those ""with obsessive devotion to their pets,"" i.e., cats. The jacket designer may be good at his/her craft, but it strikes me as looking down at the reader. During my many years with the defense community, in and out of uniform, rarely have I experienced friction with fellow cat lovers. Fortunately I've worked mostly with the cream of the profession. Those I don't get along with, well, no self-respecting cat would associate with them, either."
4,"A slice of (cat + human) life, well told","Not ""hilariously entertaining"" as the front cover would have you believe -- that is, nothing in here is laugh-out-loud funny. But it's a whimsical and amusing look at how obsessive cat owners can be through the eyes of two who sort of slid into that borderline obsession and how they got there. Interspersed are some interesting factual asides about cats and famous cat owners, but this is more of a short book-length personal essay about the pleasures and perils of multiple cat ownership. Good airplane reading."
2,"""I love my cats"" ( but.....)","Nice anecdotes -- though I felt they were ""holding"" their cats at arm's length at times.Sad to read about cats getting run over by neighbors -- the great outdoors is usually not very kind to a small being trying to cross even the quietest of streets.I was also put off by the almost flippant way in which the brutal dog meat trade was discussed (page 2), and also by the way in which the equally brutal cat meat trade was dismissed as non-existent (and this book was written recently, so it's not for lack of knowledge of these facts). This book would have been a great way to alert people to the utter brutality and suffering that cats, dogs and other meat-trade animals are being subjected to over there -- even if it's just in one or two well versed sentences.I don't approve of what they did to Bumble -- you don't kill a cat for biting you."
3,Sentimental cat- stories,"This book started in a good way with a historical consideration of Cats and their domestication. Much was made of the Egyptian 's seeing in Cats models of Beauty. Cats independence and royal indifference is contrasted favorably with servile follower Dogs. All this was interesting to a point.But then came the Kordas' anecdotes about the cats they adopted. These are supposed to be cute and humorous, but I found them somewhat inane. Perhaps this is an indication of my own less than whole- hearted involvement in the world of cats , but I felt here a kind of sentimental drivel which reminded of a definition Salinger once made . He said( and I am paraphrasing) that being sentimental about a thing is giving it more love than God gives it).I unfortunately had that kind of feeling i.e. ""They are your cats. Enjoy them. But why do I have to read about this stuff?"""
5,"Nice speakers, reasonable price","I'm not an audiophile, just someone who likes pleasant classical music around the house. Our new place was pre-wired for rear channel speakers, mounted high up on the wall in the dining room, so I bought these speakers to drop into the openings. Installation was straightforward and everything was clearly marked. The sound quality is great, to my ears anyway, and the price was quite reasonable. I'd recommend these speakers for anyone looking for a good rear-channel pair to be mounted in an interior wall."
4,"Quick, Easy, Great Sound","These speakers are fantastic, especially for the $$. They are extremely easy to install, whether you are installing in new construction or existing walls, the simply pop right in. Spring-loaded clamp-style pins make attaching the speaker cable quick and easy, and also provide the best possible connection. The sound that these speakers produce is well balanced, not too much high or low, and the speaker heads swivel (a couple degrees in each direction) so that they can be pointed to the focus of the room. All-in-all a worthwhile investment."
4,Good bargain,"I recently bought and installed these speakers for my in home surround sound. The on-wall cans we left behind in our old house sounded great and I wanted something equally as good. I can't say they match their sound, but I can say I'm pleased with the sound of these speakers. There is no distortion and they don't sound ""tinny"". Instalation was easy as far as the speakers went. Running the wires through the attic and wall was a different story, so if you're not handy you may want someone to install these. Overall, a good value for the money."
5,Very worth while book,"This book opened my eyes up to a new and improved way of living life. It presents a life totally lived for God and putting all your burdens on God, meaning all we have to do is live our lives and love God. Its all about having a child-like faith that Jesus urges us to have in the Gospels. It has made me truly happy! The peace I feel is amazing. It is indeed a peace the world has never given me!"
5,Every page a path to peace of mind,"There are many obstacles to peace of mind and heart in the spiritual life: the works of many great teachers, saints and mystics attest to this. Fr. Philippe addresses these obstacles in a way that educates to the spiritual life simply and profoundly: it is as useful for beginners as for those who have lived faithfully for years. I devoured this book initially as it seemed to address every problem which kept me trapped in more complicated thinking. Now, I meditate with it frequently and rarely fail to experience the great peace it recommends as I do so. Have given many as gifts, and almost all (except those who are idealogically opposed to being peaceful!) have received the same benefits. If ""it all begins"" with us and the state of our mind and soul, this little book has the power to change much."
5,Peace of mind and heart,"This book was recommended to me by my sister. She knew that although my faith is strong that I was going through a ""dry spell"" and didn't have the peace that I should be experiencing if God is at the center of my life. To be honest, I haven't read anything so far, that I had not heard before, but it very gently brings the important things back into focus. It is taking me a while to read through it because it is one of those books that you read a bit and then you want to cherish the words. You replay them in your head and let them swirl around until they touch your soul, as they should. I look forward to reading a little more everyday, and although I have not finished it yet, I have already bought two more copies to give to friends."
2,All About Q.C. Man...,"Got it to swap out one of them cheap PSU that came with the Antec case, lasts 2.5 months, gone, 2-3 weeks turn around, lasts another 3 months, gone, this time, 4 weeks turn around. My PC is like my home appliance these days, the keywords here are the 6.5 weeks of lost time. One must exercise EXTREME patience...woosa, woooosaaaa to get through this."
5,Antec trio 650W,"Excelente fuente, lo tengo desde mas de 6 meses y cero problemas, dicha fuente alimenta un HIS 2900XT, opteron dual core, 2gb ram, 3 discos duros, asi que lo recomiendo con los ojos cerrados."
2,Tiene Conector PCI-E 6+2 = 8pin?,"Hola quiero saber antes de comprar si esta Fuente Antec le serviria a mi VGA Nvidia 9800GX2 que tiene una entrada de alimentacion de 8pin PCIE ,, necesito saber si tiene conector PCI-E 6+2 ??Antec TP3-650 ATX 12V 650W Power Supply with Three 12V Railsgracias!!!Hello I want to know before buying Source Antec whether this would serve to my VGA Nvidia 9800GX2 that have an influx of food from 8pin ICP, I need to know if you have PCI-E connector 6 +2?Antec TP3-650 ATX 12V 650W Power Supply with Three 12V Railsthanks!"
4,Sweet,I purchased two of these power supplies and rate them highly. They are stable and deliver all the power I need. The fan is quiet. The only improvement possible is to add more 12V rails.
1,Bad Choice,"I installed this on December 18 2008, and it failed on January 17 2009, and just after <10 uses. After that it just powers the fans of my antec900 case, but the psu's fan stops after 2 secs acter power on and leaves my hard drive led on, my pc doesn't even post, I used an old spare psu and booted fine. Don't go for this one, instead get the corsair which is the best. Also, the connections feel cheap and the molex pins bend very easily."
5,Great Power Supply!,"Works great, my whole system is quiet and has no problem, although, I would like to be able to plug more fans in. I have one case fan that I can't plug in. Maybe I just have a lot of fans."
5,Very clean power the way a PC power shuld be,"I was having trouble with my bfg 7800 agp card with an antec 550. It was great, I could not believe that there could be a better on out there. the trio 650 W was very quiet and runs supprisingly cool for such loe rpm on the fan but it is cooler. ps It did solve my video card problems the cards love each other."
2,Okay,"Touches upon some common issues women in their twenties and thirties may be thinking and experiencing. I felt that it was more geared towards those in their late twenties and in their thirties. The author takes you through a great deal of exercises for you to do. Overall, it was an okay book. If you're really interested in a good read for the quarterlife crisis...pick up the books titled ""the quarterlife crisis,"" ""conquering the quarterlife crisis,"" and ""the quarterlifers companion."""
3,Good self help book,"This was a good self help book written in a way that requires you to do some extra work on your own, kind of like taking a solo workshop."
2,Boring..,"It was just soo boring I tried reading it and I couldnt pass the first chapter so I gave it away to a friend, and she lost interest in it too..."
2,Couldn't get through it,"Simply because of all the exercises throughout the book. The examples, anecdotes and stories that you can relate to are great-- however I was left feeling like I was doing something wrong when I would or could not complete an exercise. I tried to get through them, but got hung up on some of the exercises that seemed beyond my reach and therefore did not finish the book. Some exercises would have been great. Just not one every couple pages."
5,Must Read for All Women,"I am a twenty-something who happened to find this book at Barnes and Noble one evening. I rarely purchase books, but this one looked interesting and I hoped it would address a lot of things I was going through at the time. This is a phenomenal read and I recommend it to every twenty-something I meet. It's my go-to gift book for all my friends, and I expect to read it at regular intervals for new insight and more underlining. If you're going to buy anything, this book is a MUST."
1,The Reviews,I wanted to get this game for someone intill i saw how horrible this game is bad graphics bad everything anyone who say they like this game means they work for XICAT this game sucks dont buy it
1,Worst. Game. Ever.,"Ugh. This game is so abhorently, dreadfully awful, it's downright painful to play. I feel stupider for having wasted the 45 minutes it took me to give up on it. There is not a single redeeming feature to speak of. Frankly, I'm stunned that Mirage managed to stay in business after their last lemon of a game, Mortyr. But somehow, this one is even worse. There is no reason to waste your time on this, when there are so many excellent shooters out there. Just this past month Mafia, Hitman 2, and No One Lives Forever 2 came out. All are very good. ... On a side note I feel pity for the unfortunate soul who gave this game 5 stars. He clearly played this game a little too long and suffered brain damage.."
1,"Sorry, I couldn't give it 0 stars","Graphics: Are something to be desired. Think glitchy blocks for player models who can't move their mouth when they talk. Look at Unreal Tournament made YEARS before this sniper game yet graphics are superior.Sound: Nothing special.Gameplay: This is one of those horrible 'set' games. By that, I mean there is no variation in the storyline. No matter what you say in reply to people in this game, they always give the same answer, adding no variation to the storyline. Ending is pretty bad too.Worth It?: No. If you could download it from the Internet, might not be so bad, but if you are intending to spend any amount of money on this game, you are crazy. I was lucky, because I bought it for $$$ and sold it for $$$."
1,junk worse game i ever played,this game is so bad they should pay me just to have it in my posession. these guys at exicat should find another line of work because this surely isn't their bag.this game stinks big time
1,Unremittingly terrible,"I made the mistake of getting this for Christmas. You don't need to make the same error. This game takes five hours to beat, is senseless, and has a ridiculous amount of bugs. Don't support games of this poor calibre, even if you see them in bargain bins. It's becoming a bit of a yearly habit with me it seems (last year I bought the execrable ""Dusk Till Dawn"") I play a lot of games, but nowadays, with so many quality games worth playing about, there's simply no reason to endure these lemons."
2,Not Ready For Primetime,"Game as released was quirky--and then I noticed that there was a 40mb patch that you had to go to GameSpy Fileplanet to download where you had to wait over an hour just for your turn at the download area to be able to download that monster patch--that is unless you want to subscribe to Fileplanet for $6.95 per month to be able to access a high speed download area (hmmm, that seems curious)So after spending four hours getting the patch....The graphics are fair, but certainly not the best that's out there. Don't buy this one for children. The language used in the game has been written specifically for adults and lends nothing to the storyline. It seems that XICAT rushed to get this one out by Christmas 2002, because this didn't look like what was orginally promised. If I had to do it again, I would pass on this one."
4,Those who resisted and those who helped them,"This book deals with the brave, the principled or even fearful young men who risked imprisonment for their resistance to being inducted to fight in the Vietnam War. It also presents the views of some of those who defended these young men against the power of the state. I am one of those who proudly used the law to defend draftees who chose not to provide the Selective Service System with the cannon fodder needed to subjugate a people who just wanted to live in peace. Fortunately, the Asians who refused to be intimidated, and the Americans who opposed the war, prevailed. This is the account of those who fought the dragon of war and won."
4,Easy text to follow,"Used in MSCI classes. Easy text to follow with alot of examples, no case studies though. The most valuable item though is the student cd-rom. It's a great tool, especially the excel worksheets-which are easy to use. Explore the cd-rom and you'll know what I mean."
2,authors think we have no brains,the book is written with a lot of unnecessary details that are just common sense. The exersises are ok but too much stuff that was not important
4,Good Source of Information....,This book will make it easy for those who want to read for themselves and cross reference materials about Islam to validate the authenticity of the material. We need more books about Islam that let people form their opinions with facts and not emotion or politics. A great book for the classroom. Good for self evaluation of another way of life or a review and handy reference for the Muslim.
5,Treasures of unsuspected level!,"I really think the transcendental contribution and invaluable legacy bequeathed by Sandor Vegh has not been totally appreciated for the rest of the musical world.To my view, Andras Schiff and the members of the Academic Cameratta of Salzburg would be the most indicated protagonists to revel us some of the countless experiences of what meant having worked with this genius.In July 1992, when the venerable master directed the well known Dvorak's Strings serenade Op. 22, something happened around the hall; an inner tension and magical poetry hovered for some instants. And that impression was not a personal sensation. It was shared at least for fifty persons, who were present that unforgettable evening.I would like to emphasize all the recordings of Vegh are pure gold. Because his musicality was supported by an inner commitment that seemed to emerge from the deepest from his spirit and soul."
3,Not well designed,These guys didnt even put a hole to allow access to the power button. Other than that it works as advertised. Great for running.
5,works great,I've used this with my sandisk sansa 6gb for several years now. Very happy with it. Stretchy but with enough elasticity that I haven't had to replace it yet. I am careful not to leave it in direct sunlight (dash etc) but use it on a day to day basis.
3,I don't get it.,"I know these books are a huge hit, but I really don't see why. I got pretty bored halfway through the book but pushed on to see how it turned out--I'll have to say there were a couple of real surprises at the end. I prefer Ms. Harris' ""Grave"" book series. Harper Connally is a much better protagonist than Sookie. I meant to give this two stars, not three, but can't seem to change that."
5,great take on vampires,i loved the idea of vampires tying to mix with humans and the addition of a mind reading waitress and shapeshifter mixed into a murder mystery made for an entertaining book.
5,Fabulous Crossover Novel - a Winner!,"Charlaine Harris never fails to produce some of the best writing in mystery fiction today - even when creating a entire new set of characters and even a new world.Although it's often hard to blend the contemporary ""real"" world realistically with myth and legend, DEAD UNTIL DARK successfully crosses that bridge and makes its own rules.All the characters leave a lasting impression, and I certainly hope that this is the first of a very long series."
3,Likes & Dislikes,"I liked parts of this book and disliked parts, I will try to explain.Liked~ The storyline the whole vampires out of the closet,the characters were interesting even though I felt there may be too many. Oops thats a dislike.Dislike ~Too much explicit sex~~ The killing of a character that I felt would have made the series more interesting.I guess I didn't find this book great and don't feel it lived up to all the hype I've heard.I am reading the second installment and do so far like it a bit better except that as with this book she's killed off a colorful character in the first 10 or so pages.But this is about the first book.So I will conclude that the jury is still out on this series of books we'll see if when I get done with the 2nd one if it makes me want to read the 3rd."
4,Good but my least favorite book of series (because they're all so good),"The plot was good, but it took a while to get into it, unlike the other books, where you can see Charlaine got used to writing the character and took more liberties with language and explicit material. She seemed to take a while to get to the point in her writing, but that is my only complaint. Otherwise, it would have gotten a perfect score."
3,Easy Reading....,"I work long hours and found this book an easy read, relaxing & far from the realities of our world. Thouroughly enjoyed the book.... Michelle"
2,Like lemon meringue pie,"Light and fluffy and overly sweet.....not something to really sink your teeth into (sorry - couldn't resist!). None of the characters were well developed and the sex scenes were strange and uninteresting. There were never any clues as to ""whodunit"" - the ending was unremarkable and set the stage for a sequel (which I will not be reading). I much preferred Charlie Huston's violent Joe Pitt series (starting with ""Already Dead"") and Robin McKinley's intriguing ""Sunshine"" to the very forgettable Sookie Stackhouse."
5,LOVE all charlaine harris's southern vampire books,"like all books in her series, this one is great...i'm awaiting the 9th one in spring 09'....i love vampires - my 1st love is anne rice and c.h. is 2nd, 3rd is meyers...i also like christopher moore's humerous vamp tales...enjoy."
4,It's a Fun read,"Dead Until Dark was a fun read for my summer break. I've always liked fantasy books, but this one was cute b/c it had some comedy mixed into it. It's set in modern times but has a twist since half of the characters are vampires. It's perfect for people who like Buffy the Vampire Slayer or are into dark romances. I liked it b/c it had fantasy and romance, but had humor to keep it light."
3,Should have read it before Twilight,"I might have liked this more if I had read it before Twilight. As it was, it seemed like the exact same story, so I was a bit bored with it. I don't think I will read more of the series, nor do I have a desire to watch True Blood now. I don't know if I'm just vampired out or what, but it just didn't grab me at all. I think it would have been different if I read it several years ago when it first came out."
2,Disappointment,"This book was a huge disappointment for me. Maybe it was because of the fact that I had seen TV series first. I was really hopping that book would be better than TV version. But all I got was one fooolish, illogical and getting-on-my-nerves main character Sookie. Sometimes I truly hated her stupid behaviour and it ruined the whole book for me.Moreover, since I watched TV version before, I knew from the begging who the villain was. And this was a huge turn-off for me. So I would REALLY recommend everyone to read the book first before you watch TV series. You will avoid the disappointment and bitterness which I felt when reading this book."
3,Not impressed,I read this book after finishing the Twilight series and did not enjoy at all. I will not be reading any of the other b
2,Overhyped!!!,"I really didn't see what the hype was about this book. It was recomended to me by a friend, and so when I was at a used book store, I decided to buy it. I really wish I hadn't and instead had bought another book worth reading. I thought the storyline was boring and almost like she tried to fit too many events in just one book! I don't know how Harris has written eight more books in the series. To make matters worse, I thought the characters were really underdeveloped, and I didn't feel like any of them even made an impression on me. Bill was just...cold throughout the whole book, and Sookie was just, well, stupid! I thought this whole book was just pointless, and too bad for me I bought the second one. It was just the typical ""girl falls in love with a vampire"" story, but with way too much sex. I mean Sookie even refers to him as ""my vampire"" and ""my vampire boyfriend"". I honestly would not read this again."
3,"Books are only OK, HBO Series True Blood is Better","I've read Vols. #1 & #2 and I have to agree with a previous reviewer--the books are only OK. The True Blood HBO series is doing a better job with creating more depth in the supporting characters; creating a sub-plot to Sookie and Bill. I'll probably read the rest of the series if only to see how HBO will handle some of the funny twists and turns that take place and that's just in Vols. 1 & 2. After all it is a comedy, a dark comedy, but a comedy nevertheless."
3,Entertaining,"I read in one review that this series is a lighter, fluffier version of Anita Blake. That was a good description that set proper expectations for this book. This is a pretty light read-dare I say kind of cute (thinking about the last scene especially) but there are some surprisingly dark moments. Most of them are treated with humor, however, and Sookie seems to get over some major events within a few pages. While in no way does this measure up to early Anita Blake, I will probably continue with the series if only because I am interested in what happens to the characters."
5,Vampires and Southern Comfort,"Sookie Stackhouse is not your typical heroine. She's beautiful, but seen as a freak by her small town because her clairvoyance made her behave oddly as a kid. She hides her powers and yearns for love. But knowing someone's every thought is a romantic turn-off. Vampires have come out of the closet -- or the coffin and are legally in public. There's a lot of fear and hatred of them, but Sookie's willing to give them a chance. It's a relief to her when she discovers tht she can't read the mind of a handsome, attractive vampire named Bill. Romance, action and an interesting heroine. Harris's writing is simple, but expressive and Sookie is a great character."
3,"Cute, Well Written and a bit Long","Now I know why I've been hearing about this series for so long... lots of sex. There isn't that much bad language though, but if these things offend thee, seek thy reading elsewhere.With 900 reviews already here, there's not much for me to add except for a few brief personal observations, both of which I feel are critical to assessing whether you will enjoy this book. First, it's well written. Ms. Harris has a way of plotting that is rather unique. All of the events or possible turnings that other writers would make into 'something important' --which the reader would guess would happen-- she has Sookie mention as obvious. And what a relief! Imagine a character as intelligent as her audience.Second thought is that the book could have been shorter. Lots of good stuff here, but I got a tad impatient.Worth looking at if you want a fun read. Innovative and refreshing.Pam T~"
3,Just OK,I think these books are written more for young adults then adults. The HBO series does make it more interesting and adult like.
2,I Should Have Known Better,"I watch True Blood and I wanted to compare the show to the books, expecting the books to be way better. I was wrong. I have read the first 4 books of the Sookie Stackhouse novels and I can say it doesn't get better. Sookie is a cry baby who makes out with every guy she meets, and if she isn't making out with them, she is getting physically assaulted. Her and Bella Swan would be great friends. All of the characters are one dimensional and the storylines aren't really thrilling at all. I feel that the show took the concept from the books and really improved upon it. These books are not fleshed out and make Charlaine Harris look like an amateur."
2,eh...,"I have to say the relationship between bill and sookie was not developed at all. I had a hard time buying their ""love."" Page one they meet, page two they fall in ""love"" and page three they are hooking up; it was just WAY too fast. Some of the dialogue is just too ridiculous; i mean i laughed at loud at how bad it was many times. The only thing that kept me reading was to find out the mystery. these are the type of book that i read when i'm waiting for something better to come along."
2,Completely Overrated,"I read ""Dead Until Dark"" because Alan Ball loved it and I thought to myself, any guy who wrote Six Feet Under has to have pretty good literary tastes. Wrong. No. I honestly don't understand the positive reviews this book is getting because I thought it read like a cheesy romance novel. The first couple chapters were okay, but as Sookie became more and more reliant on her vampire lover, any shred of independence and quick thinking present in her character were demolished.If you're into romance novels, read this. If, like me, you'd rather read about star-crossed lovers that don't make you want to barf, pick up pride and prejudice."
2,Very Disappointed,"I was given this book by a friend. She said to read it because now that I had finished reading the Twilight books, it was another vampire series I would enjoy. I put it on a shelf because at the time I was busy reading other books. Then recently my book club picked this book to read. The girl who choose it spoke so highly of it. The reviews online seemed so positive, and hey, it was used to create a television show. So it must be good?This weekend I dusted it off and began. The story is somewhat compelling at points, but the author has you all over the place and leaves some plot lines dangling. It borders the ""Trashy Romance"" type novel and doesn't seem to have much depth. This is not a series I will continue reading. The story did nothing to compel me to continue reading it. In fact, if it weren't for the book club, I would have put this book down after the first sexual vampire account. This book is all hype and I was extremely disappointed in reading it."
2,Eh,"I'm more than 3/4 through with the book and I can barely bring myself to finish it. It's not funny. It's not exciting. It hasn't drawn me in. I don't care about the characters (could be that with the True Blood trailers plastered all over TV, I keep picturing the gap-toothed heroine, who I don't particularly care for).I'm fighting to finish the book. I doubt I'll continue the series.What was with Sookie doubling over with laughter after she found her grandmother dead...would you have even noticed Bill's shirt if you found your grandmother murdered? What's with Sookie thinking she'll read Sam sometime, when she catches him off guard...then telling Bill she's not able to read him? What's with all the slutty trailer trash in that town? Sorry to those of you that are fans, but I'm just not getting it."
3,"Pulp, pulp, pulp","This is worth reading for one reason and one reason only: if you like the TV series, then go ahead and give this book a read. I can't say this enough, Charlaine Harris is a crappy, pulp writer that happened to hit upon a pretty good idea. She is in no way a good enough writer for this idea. Ugh. I just wish someone that was a decent author had written this series."
3,Must-read for lovers of Southern fiction,"Any Southern fiction fan would enjoy this book, and it's not strictly for fantasy readers. The vampire setting is completely fun, and the narrator's special disability (mind reading) is portrayed well. Sookie is a likeable hardworking Southern gal who has to deal with some issues most people never face. This is a mystery and a love story wrapped up in a wacky little package, and it makes for terrific reading."
3,"Okay, but...","I kept reading, so that's a good thing. But sometimes you find a book that doesn't completely grip you, and this was one of those."
5,Great Book!,I have been wanting to start the Sookie Stackhouse series for awhile! I'm so glad that I did. Definitely keeps you interested throughout the whole book!!
5,"Not my usual genre and to my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed it!","I don't usually read novels that involve the supernatural or sci-fi, but tried this one because 'Dead Until Dark' was recommended to me, and I was looking for some new authors to read. (This was a Kindle edition with ~no~ spelling errors.) I was leery of the vampire theme and element, but plowed on into it. Much to my delight, I was able to suspend disbelief and thoroughly enjoy this book. It is well written and held my interest on every page. There is an subtle element of humor to it on the part of the main character, at times, with her narrative which was most enjoyable. I will be buying the second book (Kindle edition) in the series, and hope it delivers as well as this one did."
3,Easy read but hard to follow at times,"I wanted to pick up a summer reading series, and being a fan of HBO's True Blood series, I decided to read the Sookie Stackhouse series. I really wanted to like the book but I just couldn't stay interested in it, and at certain parts it was hard to follow what the author was trying to communicate. Overall - I only read this book and don't plan on reading the rest of the series."
3,Dead Until Dark,"This is going to be a Mini Review, simply because with series novels like this I don't feel like there's a whole lot to say.Unfortunately, I wasn't as entranced by this novel as I thought I'd be. The romance seemed to be lacking some sort of passion. I was actually more interested in seeing Sookie get with the bad guys than the good guy (which I actually hope happens in future novels.)This felt like exactly what it was: an introduction. Now the question is, was it enough to get me to read more? Or should I just watch the TV show and let that satisfy my curiosity?"
3,It's okay,"Well, I'm another Twilighter looking for something to fill the void. I hoped this series would do the trick. Sadly, the main heroine, Sookie, is highly annoying and her love interest, Vampire Bill, is such a wuss. I can't be bothered to continue with this series. Bubba was funny. He's the reason I gave this book 3 stars instead of 2."
5,Very Enjoyable,I loved this book from the first chapter. Before I knew it I was finished. I would highly recommend this book. All the town's people are interesting and entertaining. An Sookie is a very fun character to follow.
4,"A light, fast, fun read.","I bought this book after falling in love with True Blood.The book is written in narrative from Sookie's point of view. Its a good read if you are a fan of the show, and there are enough differences to keep you going. The story telling isn't as rich in the book, these books might not do it for you if you are looking for something that compares to Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. But Dead Until Dark is plenty of fun.The book is good enough that as soon as I put down the first book and ordered the box set!."
3,Dead Until Dark,This book is the basis for the HBO show True Blood which is the reason why I picked it up. It's a great easy read with a little sex and blood. You don't have to concentrate much.
2,I'll stick with Anita...,"After listening to and enjoying Charlaine Harris's Grave Sights on audiotape, I headed to my library to check out her other books. I'd read good reviews here of the Sookie Stackhouse Southern Vampire series, so I began with Dead Until Dark. I must say that I found this book's prose stilted and the dialogue and plot somewhat juvenile. I found Sookie and her vampire boyfriend, Bill to be shallow characters and the plot vapid compared to those of Harper Connelly and her brother, Tolliver in Grave Sights. In the future, if I want to read about vampires I'll stick with Laurell Hamilton's edgy and well written Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter novels."
5,Im hooked,"This book is just great! Its suspenseful keeps you on the edge of your seat trying to think of what the heck is gonna happen next!FYI Im pretty sure you dont want a young young girl to read the book it does have alot of sexual things in it. Not like a porno or anything but its graphic enough to matter if your kids like probably under 16 would be my guess but kids are sexually active alot younger these days.. I know i know people think ""oh not my baby"" but be realistic!! This book was great i just love authors individual interpretations of supernatural things like vampires and such.. I will be reading the whole series for sure"
2,Lacking Convincing Characters,"The concept of the novel had potential however; I just didn't find the characters to be very credible. For example, the reader learns immediately that Sookie (the main character) has a ""disability""; she is able to ""hear"" the thoughts of others. She has had this disablilty her whole life and, over time, has learned to block some of the ""noise"" out. We also find out that Sookie had a very sad childhood. She lost both of her parents when she was young and she was molested by a family member.Nonetheless, Sookie comes accross as a naive, trusting, and optimistic person. I just think that someone with her life experience would be more cynical and disillusioned. In my opinion, the story would have been more believable if the main character had a darker outlook on the world. She was just too darn nice!"
1,Very poor read,"Sorry to all the Charlaine Harris fans out there, but this book is horrible. I read the book after True Blood started airing so that I could get some good background before delving into the series, but this book has turned me off of both. The main character, Sookie, is silly and vapid. She does not react in a believable way to anything, and I found it extremely hard to believe that every guy she meets is in love with her at first sight. Bill, her main love interest, is bland and uninteresting, and the love scenes between the two that litter the book seemed redundant and cheap. I certainly wasn't expecting a bad romance novel when I picked this up. But the worst part is the horrendous writing with zero character development, unless you count describing hair styles and changes of clothes. I highly doubt this book would have been published if vampires weren't the current rage, and I get the distinct feeling that Ms. Harris wishes she were Sookie."
5,a fun and entertaining read,"i've been a huge fan of the true blood series on hbo. i've enjoyed the characters and story lines. i knew ms. harris wrote the books and now there are many titles available, so i thought i would check a couple out. i really enjoyed reading this book. the television show follows the story quite well. thankfully there's enough difference in the book to keep the story interesting. whether you read the book first or watch the show, it really doesn't matter. both are well-done. i do highly recommend reading the adventures of sooki stackhouse though. it is a fun and entertaining read!"
3,Better Than Not Reading At All,"For the first time in my long life that I can remember, I can honestly say that the TV series is much better than the book. The character development wasn't bad and the storyline was acceptable, but the reading level was somewhat simplistic and some of the plot courses were unlikely.I can understand how high school students would find this book series interesting and enjoyable. I can only hope it leads them to read much better written and inspiring works of literature.I can't say that reading this book was a waste of time, but it seems the writers of the HBO series are more talented than the book author."
5,A Fun Version of an Anne Rice Vampire Tale,"I am a devoted Anne Rice fan and have read all of her Vampire and Mayfair Witches books. A friend recently gave me this book to read and I fell in love with the main character Sookie. This book is like mixing some down home charm and a little bit of Hee Haw into a vampire story! It's a great read and I find myself snickering out loud at some of the thoughts that go through Sookie's head. If you're looking for a ""fun"" story with vampires, please read this book!"
4,Fun Read,"I have read both ""Interview With a Vampire"" and the entire ""Twilight"" series. I was curious about Charlaine Harris' novels. I was really glad I read this book. It's so much fun and reads very quickly. Sookie Stackhouse is a very interesting and inspiring heroine. She stands up for herself, right from the outset of the novel and yet still comes across as very real and vulnerable. I haven't yet moved on to the rest of the Sookie novels, but I'm sure I will. I highly recommend this book!"
5,"great vampire, love, suspense",This is a book that has a suspense filled story that keeps you reading. Based with love and vampires is a great read!
2,I don't know how to rate this book.,Good grief...I'm not sure how to rate this book. I found Ms. Harris prose very annoying...who using ( ) to clarify the main character's thoughts??? I'm convinced now that even I could write a book!! But I found the characters likable and the concept of the story was interesting even if her way of telling it got on my nerves. By the end of the book I became use to her writing style...even though I still didn't particularly like it. Of course now I find myself wondering what happens to Sookie next...so yes I broke down and bought the next book! YIKES! So I give it 2 stars...maybe the next book will be better!
2,Just a tad too messy.,"I started reading this with a completly open mind to a new writer and a new style, but I really just could not get into this book. It felt rushed, dry and a little messy.The plot was moving along so fast I could not keep up with it. The characters weren't introduced well and I didn't really feel anything for them. The romance did not seem real to me and the sex scenes were about as dry as the characters themselves. The story bounced around so much I really just could not get myself sucked into it.Overall I certainly did not care for this book, but in no way am I saying this to disrespect the writer. I have only the utmost respect for any author, no matter what I think about the book. And this in no way turns me off from reading one of her other books if one catches my eye."
2,Only So-So,"As several others have pointed out this book is very derivative of Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake series. While Charlaine Harris has enough of her own ""voice"" here 75% of the book could have been Anita Blake. And do all Vampire girlfriends have to be short & busty?"
3,good when you're in the mood,"Though I enjoyed the book it is not the best of either vampire or mystery novels. The characters can be a little one dementional and dumb (no one would leave their child for the night with someone that is known to be being stalked by a murderer). Despite this, it is a good book when you want something light, fun, and different."
4,funny and sexy...,"I had just finished reading the Twilight saga and was looking for other great vampire books. I have heard of the 'True Blood"" series on HBO and I am just waiting for it to come on DVD. Then I came across this series and found out ""True Blood"" is based on it. I just finished ""Dead until Dark"", and as other reviewers have posted, the similarities with Twilight are undeniable, but the plot and characters are different. I trully enjoyed the characters on this book, and Sookie? Oh boy, how funny is that girl. Just when you think the story is getting serious, she would throw a punch line that would make me laugh so hard. I loved it! Is definetly a more ""grown up"" book, sexy in its own way. Any writer who can put ""fang-banger"" and ""Sally Jesse"" on the same paragraph wins my vote :)"
4,btme2,"I have been watching the HBO TrueBlood and became interested in the written series. I loved the book even better than the TV series which I didn't think was possible. It was smart, funny, mysterious and sexy. It was also easy to read.Luv'd it!!"
5,Absolutely have to read!,"Absolutely have to read!This book is the one you absolutely have to read! I am not a reader, and I am re-reading this book second time right now. I started to watch ""True Blood"" on HBO, and couldn't wait for next episode for whole week, so I decided that I'll read. I was afraid that that will be difficult for me, because the English is the third language for me, but this book is written easy to read have a lot of action, mystery and love in very realistic form. After I finish reading first book, I started next until I finished all 8 books and now can't wait to the 9-th book, which will be publishing in May 2009. I hope one day that book will be translated to other languages as well."
1,Mix Harlequin romances with Twilight...,"And you get this novel. Some reviews called this book funny, but the only amusing part was laughing at the author, not with her. The dialogue is strained at best and the plot line is very transparent. I wouldn't even recommend this as a popcorn book, I'm afraid."
5,Dead until dark,"This is the first book I read of Charlaine's. It was so funny in parts that brought tears to my eyes with names like Sukie Stackhouse and Bill the Vampire with many usual characters that entertained from beginning to end. You love the world of the unusual then this is the book for you. It is sometimes horrible sometimes sexy and humorous. The story was a light, fun read. The characters were interesting and straightforward and the story was so entertaining I couldn't put the book down. I like the mind reading thing and of course the vampires.Also recommended: The Price of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock and anything by Anne Rice"
4,Calorie-free guilty pleasure,"Yes, this is guilty pleasure summer reading. But if you accept that that's what it is, and that it isn't trying to be more than that, it's really great.One can't help comparing Sookie to Bella from Twilight, and Sookie certainly comes out in the lead. She's a strong, brave, and sassy heroine that I look forward to reading about, whereas Bella is just a side show for Edward. These books are truly about the female lead."
5,Loved it!,I really enjoyed this book. I loved the characters and it was very fast paced. An easy and enjoyable read.
4,Better than Twilight,"So... this kicks Twilight's ass. Don't get me wrong, I loved Twilight. However, there were plot holes and things that didn't make sense in that series and the heroine, Bella, was at times infuriating for being so immature and such a pushover. Sookie is a grownup, and acts like it. She has a weird sense of humor and isn't afraid to shut her man-vamp down if he's being irrational. In short, Twilight is meant for teenagers while this series is meant for adults."
3,Fun Read,"If you are expecting a Laurell K. Hamilton clone, you will be disappointed. However, if you like a fun read with some new twists and turns, read ""Dead Until Dark"".Both main characters are establishing an identity and do it well while solving a mystery. Harris has her own unique style of writing and for me it works. I'm definitely looking forward to the next in the series."
2,It's no Twilight or Interview...,"While this book is written on about a 7th grade level, the subject matter is mature. The writing was dull, the characters shallow and at times I found myself thinking ""Why am I still reading this?"" Because I try to always finish a book when I start it, I pushed myself through hoping it would get better, but alas, it only got worse."
2,Boring as watching paint dry but deserves a pass,"I could care less if this book was based of the greatest TV show known to man. Dead Until Dark is probably the most boring book I've ever read. I don't know if its because I knew what would happen because of True Blood but one thing that can't be excused was the awkward writing. VERY awkward. That and the filler scenes are what pretty much turned me off on the book. I strongly believe that if a scene does not or will not contribute to the novel, then or later, it should be nixed. This is the same problem I had with Stephanie Meyer's Twilight, except I gave her's a four because the writing was really good.This is just my really biased opinion, but I do recommend you give this book a big pass because as you read on they get MUCH better and much MUCH more exciting."
2,Disappointingly Bad,"Having seen a few episodes of HBO's ""True Blood,"" I was curious to read the books that inspired the series. I was extremely disappointed in this book, though. Harris' dialogue is painfully awful, and her writing is very amateurish. Her tendency to describe every little thing Sookie does/thinks is unnecessary and one of the biggest no-no's in fiction writing.I like the idea of the plot and the characters, but Harris' writing style is simply too bad for me to continue reading the series. I'm glad the writers of the show have taken their liberties with the dialogue, otherwise I'm sure the show would have been cancelled by now."
4,Really interesting characters to fall in love with,"I've always loved vampire books, but the Sookie series is so different because of the Southern, average working-woman point of view. Sookie is so down to earth, and her voice is so normal that the book is really fresh. No florid language or descriptions here. Just a totally understandable person, in a not so understandable or normal world. Fantastic series! Good book to start it."
2,Not What I Expected...,"After watching True Blood on HBO I decided to purchase the Sookie Stackhouse novels to read. This is the first book in the series and I was very disappointed. The author is a very immature writer with poor characterizations and stereotypes galore. Most of her characters are not fleshed out and those who are well developed are unpleasant to say the least. I did not like Sookie in True Blood but I downright hated her in this book. She uses her telepathy to make excuses as to why her life sucks and she is, at times, horribly nasty to the people who care about her. She blames her vampire lover Bill for things he has no control over and she runs hot and cold about their relationship. I got the distinct impression that this book was written by a ten year old and I have no idea how it got published and I will never understand how it got so popular. I will continue watching True Blood but I am done reading any books by this author."
2,Not as good as I expected.,"I picked up these books on recommendation from this site and people who had read books by Laurell K. Hamilton. After finishing the first book, I found myself disappointed.I feel that the storyline jumped around a lot with no good reason. Many times it felt like Sookie was making decisions based on the fact that the writer had to keep the story going instead of what Sookie might actually do. Additionally, perhaps that is what Sookie would do and the character development in the book was the thing that was lacking.The writing style was difficult to read at times, especially during the dialogue.Overall the book was ok: the story was ok, the writing was ok and the characters were ok. Unfortunately I was expecting something better than ok."
4,Everything I Expected,"I had already seen all of the True Blood series on TV after choosing to begin reading the books, and I feel like the books are just another way to detail in and see more of life in Bon Temps! Highly recommend for True Blood fans!"
5,Just as good as the series,"very nicely written book, the story is almost the same as the series, the series are more bloody and scary though!"
4,Great read,It took a couple chapters for me to get into the book but after that I was hooked. I've read the first two books in her series in a week and a half and I plan on buying the third installment today.
5,first pay cable vampire series,"starts here. make quick easy friends with Sookie and enter her world of vampires, shapeshifters... and stay for a while."
2,Hope It Picks Up,I have read a lot of vampire novels. As a matter of fact I make a point to read everything that comes out. I found the characters to be flat in particular the main character Sookie Stackhouse (who is suppose to have the ability to read people's minds). All of the characters have no real life. I could care less who lived or died and there was no draw to keep reading. The sex in the book was okay - but not fantastic. The main premise of the book is that vampires are out in the open; this made the story a bit far fetched for me. And also made it less mysterious. I've heard that if you watch the show the books get better. I'll try this before reading book two.
1,No way can compare with Tanya Huff or Laurell K. Hamilton,"I picked up this book mainly because of the reviews and because she was compared favorably with Tanya Huff's vampire series and Laurell K. Hamilton. No Way! Tanya Huff's was my favorite and I enjoyed Laurell Hamilton's up to the last three books. This book did not have anything in it that caught at my attention enough to keep reading. If you are looking for a good vampire book try the above two authors or Barbara Hambly's two vampire books, or a book called the Vampire and the Cowboy. This book I would rate as boring and just plain dumb."
4,Dead Until Dark,"Ok, I admit I read this becausa I am a TrueBlood follower. But, I am happy I did. Ms. Harris has made me laugh out loud and I must say that I am a Sookie Stackhouse fan (and Vampire Bill is my Southern Gentleman hero). The twist and turn of the plot kept me guessing - I am off to read book 2 (Living Dead in Dallas)"
4,Great Series,"This is a really fun read even if vamp novels aren't normally your thing. I ended up buying and reading all 8 of the books in this series. The new series on HBO, TRUE BLOOD is based on this first book. It's addicting."
2,Hoping the series gets better,"I've read various contemporary vampire series and figured I'd give this a try. I suppose I could call it kind of cute at times. But that doesn't seem right for a vampire book. But that's it. I think the cover really says it all. The vampire, Bill, has no personality whatsoever. I know he's a vampire, but he could have a little more depth. He's kind of boring. And Sookie... well, I can think of several words to describe her, none of which are very flattering. But, she reminds me of a bad actress. Know how when you see a movie with a character that just clearly can't act? And you want to like her but it's just bad...? That's what Sookie reminds me of. And she spends half the novel crying. I don't know. It was different, so I will probably give the second one a shot."
2,"Um, no.","After the reviews that people wrote about how great this novel was, naturally, I was compelled to read it. I read the Twilight series, so I'm all in for vampire novels. However, this was a disappointment. Like you probably will, I ignored all of the ""bad"" reviews, wanting to give the book a chance. I was wrong. This book is terrible. You can predict everything that will happen pages, even chapters before it does. If there's ever a moment in the book where there's danger, or a ""life-threatening"" event (which in my opinion was extremely unengaging and uninteresting) everything is fine in the end. This book has some sex scenes but the author has a strange way of writing them which confuses you and gives little interest to the reader. I wouldn't waste my time if I were you."
4,Entertaining ~ Fast Read!,After finishing the Twilight series I was looking for my next book read and happened upon the Sookie Stackhouse series. The reviews on Amazon's website convinced me I needed to give it a try. I found the first book very entertaining and such a fast read! Gotta love that!!! The storyline is silly but for some reason I couldn't put it down. I've finsihed her 1st and 2nd book and will be purchasing the 3rd shortly.
2,A Biased Review,"I read this book after watching season 1 of the show True Blood. I felt myself comparing the 2 throughout the book. I prefer the show to the book.The story is well written. But I couldn't connect with Sookie the character in the book and thought she acted foolishly, sometimes stupidly. I felt the book was a more of a murder mystery than anything else. The show focuses more on her relationship with Bill. I have also grown to like the other characters in the show and felt the book was amazingly one-dimensional. I won't be continuing the series."
3,"I like it, but...","Well, after Trueblood, I have to read these, and I'm enjoying this 1st one, overall.The sex scenes (I've only read 2, so far) are ok. They're sexy, not pornographic, to my taste.I simply find it readable and engaging. Obviously, people differ.BUT...I find a glaring plot inconsistency around the 3 trouble making vampires.Sookie discussed with Bill how vampires keep their sleeping locations ultra-secret. Then, for some reason (like, C. Harris wanted the plot to go in a certain direction, and took the most direct route, even though it makes no sense?) *EVERYONE* knows where these 3 sleep. DUH!!And, again, Harris needed the plot to go in a certain direction so she has Sookie almost criminally negligent in doing so little to thwart a mob. She needed Bill to return her call. Kinda' lame plotting, there.Well, it's not literature. It's just fun."
3,Summer Read,"""Summer Read"" in my mind means overdone sex, campy mystery, and humor.From prior reviews I expected a mix of Evanavich's Stephanie Plum character and Meyer's Bella character but that's not what I got.I bought the whole series but will probably not read them."
5,Pulls you in,"I love the show so much I had to get the books! The only ""problem"" with the first book is I already knew most of what was to happen! While Sookie falls in love with Bill, I found myself falling for the elusive Eric, though I'm sure the actor who played him had something to do with that as well! Eric is definitely my favorite character, Lafayette a close second. The only bummer is that while you get swept away with the characters, some of the characters get swept away all too soon! Just shows the making of a great writer to make you care that much about losing characters you just met, though! A great series, I highly recommend it!"
3,Don't Love Sookie,"The book itself is well written and fast going, a really easy read. I was drawn to it because of the hype and I like the story but I don't like Sookie. Granted this is the first in the series and if I continue reading I may change my mind about the heroine but I just felt like she was a little too damsel in distress for me."
5,Loved it.,"I heard about this series from a friend and decided to pick it up. Honestly I am not a big reader, I stick to my comic books and television for entertainment. However I have to say this book was surprisingly easy to read, and a hell of an action packed ride too. I love how Charlaine Harris writes in a way that really puts you into the main character's thought process. I also enjoyed that for the majority of the book there was action and purpose. I have to say once I picked this book up, I could not put it down. Great read if you love the supernatural, mystery, adventure and a little smut all mixed together."
2,Not Impressed,"I gave it a two only because it did hold my interest enough to finish, but it really was not a great book. The writing was OK, I never felt like I cared about the characters, and the plot seemed quite random. I won't say the ending but it was weird. I like this type of story so I thought I would like this book and was really hoping to get into it, but it fell pretty short."
5,Love it!,How can you not like this? This has become one of my favs! I am going to devour this series.
4,better than Twilight,"Dead Until Dark (Sookie Stackhouse, Book 1)by Charlaine Harris; Oh ha ha ha! So Stephanie Meyer DIDN'T think up the whole vampire-werewolf-beautiful girl menage-a-trois by herself?? If I was Ms. Harris I'd be suing Stephanie Meyer for at least a portion of the gazillions she made off of her blatant ripoff... oh wait.. how'd I like the book? Funny, much sexier than Bella and Edward, and Sookie is SO much better at taking care of herself. I laughed, snickered and ROFLedMAO at Bubba."
3,Entertaining but did not meet up to Twilight,"I bought this book in hopes that it would cure my Twilight withdrawal and even though it did in some ways ""Dead until Dark"" still did not measure up all together. Here is what is good; Sookie is much more of a character than Bella. She won't take any crap and isn't afraid to put her foot down. Here is what is bad; Bill never becomes the character that Edward is. To me, Bill is just a Sookie's boyfriend but I don't feel anything for him. While reading Twilight I actually hoped my own little Edward would walk through the door. Also the story gets somewhat ridiculous at times. Stuff like coffins and garlic which Twilight dismissed as myths Dead until Dark treats as true and that just adds to the ""way-to-much-fantasy-for-me""-part and the love story between Sookie and Bill never gets as strong as between Edward and Bella. But overall, this was an entertaining book. I might just have to search elsewhere for a love story like Edward and Bella."
4,Great...same as show,"This book was very similar to the True Blood series on HBO. The difference is that you get a little more info. A few things are different (like the same thing that happened on the show only done by a different character). Also, there is no Tara to speak of....she isn't in the book!"
3,True Bood is Better,"After watching the True Blood series on HBO, I was very excited about reading the book. With most book/movie comparisons, the book is better than the movie. In this case, the series is much better than the book. The book isn't bad, but everywhere the series varied from the book, it was an improvement and made it a higher quality product. I am patiently waiting for Summer 2009 for Season 2 of True Blood!"
2,What a disappointment.,"What a disappointment. I heard so much hype about this book. I found it boring and I had to make myself continue reading because I was sure it would eventually get better (after hearing so much great stuff about the series). I'm glad I didn't buy the boxed set, and only spent my money on the first book."
2,Never grabbed my attention,"I liked Harris' style of writing. She moves the story well and tries to keep the reader engaged. Unfortunately, the story itself fell flat. Sookie, the main character, is described as being intelligent, but naive. Unfortunately, her small town experience is taken to the extreme that she comes across as anything but intelligent.The mystery portion of the novel is well done, but as is often the case when one is done well the other, the relationships in this case, are stiff and poorly developed. I didn't like Bill and wondered why Sookie would allow herself to be used by him, however much he professed to love her.Much more interesting to me was the shape shifter whom she almost completely ignores.Overall it was a quick read, but one that never did quite pull me into the story and make me care about the characters."
5,As Enjoyable as Any Vampire Novel,"Charlaine is a masterful crafter of 1st person prose. Her main character is instantly likable and only becomes more so as her depth is explored. This series has originality, great new characters, and a diverse cast. A little sex, plenty of blood, but only mild violence.Great read!"
1,Terrible,"This book is terribly written. The story line and characters are not developed, which is great because the writing is almost too painful to endure. I only made it through because a co-worker lent it to me and told me not to give up. Fortunately, it's such mindless writing I was able to speed through it in a couple of hours. Surely, there a better vampire stories out there for people who are hooked on this particular style of fantasy writing."
2,4 & 5 Stars for this book? What?,"I'm going to give the books time to grow on me only because the show on HBO has me hooked and I can't wait to see what happens. People keep telling me to stick with it because the later books are better reads , and I'm going to try my best, but good gosh the books are not that great. Conversations and actions are choppy, and the story just doesn't flow right. When I'm done reading the entire series, and if I change my mind I will also change my review, but as of right now this series gets a 2 Star from me."
3,5 out of 10,"The subject matter in this book was entertaining for an easy read, but it was poorly written. I figured I would read this novel to see what all the fuss was about, and found out that I do not want to continue reading the series.It's good for an easy read about vampires and such, but as a literary snob I had to comment on the writing style."
3,"Nice work, but derivative","I'd have given this book 4 stars, but the similarity to Laurel Hamilton's work was so marked that even some of the intended ""twists"" were predictable long in advance because they were the same as in Hamilton's books. The book is still worth a read, though, thanks to polished prose and a good narrative voice."
4,You must read this series!,"There may be nothing I can say to get you to hit buy now or make you get in your car at this very moment and go to the book store, but you should. I picked up this book on a whim on my lunch break. I had never heard of the book series or the television show. It was the best decision I have ever made (book wise). You instantly care about sookie, she is head strong, girly and charming. I must say If you are watching the show and thinking about reading the series they are different and amazing in their own rights. The books tend to be more serious and deadly, while the show is a little more comical. I have lent these books to many people and have never heard anything back but how in love with the series they are. I know that every book may not be everyones ideal read but the 344 five star reviews infront of mine speak for themselves"
3,Not my cup of tea!,"I really tried to like this book, and at first I did, until Grandma died. The story line just got stranger and stranger. Now I like Stephen King and Dean Koontz and I even liked Stephanie Meyers, but I could not enjoy this as I have other books. There was nothing for me to grab hold of on any of the characters. This will be my first and last Sothern Vampire Mysteries novel."
1,you should read,when i first started reading it i thought it was just like twilight but i read the series and i loved them. i recamend people reading it.
5,I didn't think I would like it,"I don't like vampire books or movies however this is not the regular vampire book. Charlaine Harris has created a wonderful character Sookie Stackhouse who you just have to admire and like the way she uses her ""special gift"". I am on my 2nd book."
2,Too violent for me,"Characters are interesting, story is good, but I'm a complete wimp about violence in movies and books, so this book was too much for me. The ""villain"" in this book is really disturbing, psychotic, and violent toward women. Because Sookie can read minds she can see his gross thoughts. Turned me off of the series."
3,"Fun, easy reading","This was a fast and easy read. The author keeps you interested with action and expecting new twists with each turn of the page (or swipe of the finger). Nothing is deep or moving and there were some scenes that weren't fully explained or explored, but overall a fun read and I'll pick up the next book in the series for light reading in between my literary fiction reading."
4,"Show first, now the books?","Don't be apprehensive if you've already watched the show. As the books progress, you'll see that there are some variations to the storyline. Initially, as a big fan of the show, I was leary that it might somehow take from my enjoyment of the program.On the contrary, it enhanced my experience by getting in deeper, so-to-speack. The books are tightly intermixing plots and give greater details into the inner-workings of Sookie's mind. Even more so than the show.I recommend this to a program fan, if not for any other reason - the books last longer than an hour!"
4,Better than the HBO Series,"I decided to read this book because I enjoyed season one of HBO True Blood. So I bought the book. I really liked it and now I'm reading the other books of the series. I am NOT a vampire fan, never read Twilight (and don't plan to), so I was not the audience for this novel. However, I found the novel is very entertaining, has a good pace and has some cool original twists. It is an easy reading, something that I save for vacation days or days that I don't want to challenge myself with something a bit more serious. Also, I now enjoy the books in the series better than the HBO show. I haven't finished the entire book series yet, but this far I am enjoying every book, and this one I definitely recommend."
4,Southern Fried Vampire served up with gravy!,"How could anyone not adore Sookie Stackhouse? She's plain spoken, God fearin', and lives in a small parish in Louisiana with no aspirations other than to work on her tan, and make ends meet at Merlotte's as a cocktail waitress. All would be seemingly hum-drum if not for the otherworldly gift she has:clarivoyance (which has been a pain in the tookus to her)until Vampire Bill steps into her life and lights her up like the big Pabst Blue Ribbon sign.From that moment forward, this plucky heroine is entangled in a net of murderous vampires, scared-out-of-their-wits country bumpkins, inept law enforcement, and Bill's sexy boss Eric to boot.Get out your Daisy Dukes for a hilarious and thoroughly enjoyable read from Charlaine Harris. I found Sookie to be the best of sports, and this Southern Vampire Series was hard to put down!Copyright(c)Nicola Mattos"
4,"Good Plot, but focused for adults.","I really liked the plot of this book. I saw it while searching for something for a book report. Yes I'm 14 years old, and I picked this book up. I wish though they would have said something about their being sexual themes. I happened to be on a page with that, I didn't know it had it in it, and my teacher read it from over my shoulder. I had to explain that I hadn't ever read the book and that I didn't know it had that in it. Very good plot and everything but it needs something that says, for MATURE AUDIENCES!!!"
4,"If you like the TV series, read the books!","I started on the book series because I'm such a fan of the TV series. And while I'm still a fan of the TV series, I do think I like some of the humor and twists of the books better. Obviously, the producers of the show have taken huge liberties and even changed the way some of the events--such as the serial murders--took place."
2,"Great concept, terribly written","While I am a fan of ""True Blood"", I was not a fan of Harris' written work, which is quite rare, becasue I usually go the opposite way when it comes to books and their film forms. This is perhaps the first book I can say I actually like the series better than the book. But I digress.I think Harris' concept is fantastic. She has a dynamic cast of characters, all with their own quirks and issues. Each character is colorful and paints a vivid picture. Towards the middle and end of the book, however, I lose my connection with the characters. I feel as though too much is going on at once and it loses the reader's interest and muddles the time line of events. I'm not a particular fan of her style of writing - but that's just a personal opinion.While the story line is an intriguing one, I feel Harris loses her grip on her characters halfway through the story and leaves the reader confused and unhappy at the end.The Last Saint"
2,"If you like the show, don't read the books","I've recently started watching the show on HBO, and I really enjoy it. So, while waiting for the second season to be released on DVD I thought I'd give the books a go. I was sorely disapointed. The polt and character development in the show was miles above what it was in the book. I only got about halfway through the book before I just gave up. I won't be reading anymore of this series, but I'll definately be watching the show!"
4,Very Entertaining,"It must have been the Halloween season that drew me to a vampire book. This is the first Charlaine Harris book I have read, and I was thoroughly entertained. The book was witty and complicated. I read many mystery novels each year, and very few books keep me guessing. The only reason this book did not rate five stars, is because I do not have the entire remaining series on my nightstand. I look forward to reading every Charlaine Harris Southern Vampire Mystery."
1,"Oh, now this is bad","I made it through the first few pages of this book, and had to check to make sure I hadn't accidentally picked up a high school term paper. The writing here is so pedestrian, so lacking in originality or innovation, it makes me assume that adapting this piece of garbage into an absorbing television show must have been one hell of a challenge. The good news for me is that I won't have to suffer through any more of Charlaine Harris' excruciating prose; not when I have ""True Blood."""
2,No details in this book,"I had high high hopes for this book, and the series in general. BUT. To be honest, this book was just terrible. I felt that character detailed severely lacked, details of locations and events are hardly there at all. Overall, a very disappointing read. I tried getting into the second book of the series, but I just really do not like Harris' story writing. I prefer precision in my books with vivid detail so that I can map the characters and places in my mind. I found that I'd open the book, read a few pages, and put it down. There just wasn't anything to hold my attention. My personal opinion is that season one of True Blood did a much better job with Harris' story than Harris managed to do herself. I'll give it 2 stars because the story basics are good, but overall, the execution, in my mind, was terrible."
1,horrible book,In the beginning it started out with what seemed like wit and humor... and slowly went further and further downhill. I never want to read another book by this author ever again. I only suggest reading this if you want a fluffy book made for lovers of romance novels. This will not appeal to people at all interested in horror books or vampires. It has far too much sex and attempts to have an interesting plot but fails badly. The inclusion of Bubba was the stupidest thing I have ever heard.
2,"For Twilight readers, this is a disappointment.","From the reviews, it appears there are a lot of Twilight fans (including me) looking for more to read and they have found this book. I have to admit that this is a disappointment on more than one level for me. First, I felt it was rather poorly written. The story seemed to be disorganized and downright cheesy in places. Second, after reading this book, I had to question the originality of the Twilight series. Harris' book was published in 2001. Stephanie Meyer didn't begin writing Twilight until 2003. The similarities between the two are unbelievable. In fact, I was given this book to read because the stories are so much alike, not because this was a great book."
5,A great new vampire series(I hope),"Picture a world where vampires are just another minority group. They have jobs, houses, and interact with the general population, not just in the usual Dracula way. Sookie has always wanted to meet one. She has an unusual ""disability"" and is very interested in things that are out of the ordinary. One evening a vampire walks into the cocktail bar where she works and she is very interested and curious. She saves his ""life"" one night, and soon after they become involved. One problem, someone seems to be killing women who are involved with vampires, and the police seem to suspect her brother.This novel has a little bit of everything, humor, horror, romance, suspense, and mystery. Hopefully, there will be a sequel soon."
2,I Really Wanted To Like This Book,"I'll preface this review by saying that I REALLY like the HBO series, True Blood. I also really wanted to like this book, but I can't say that I did. I just don't like this author's writing style. I found myself rolling my eyes quite frequently because of all of the terrible analogies and the downright corny writing. I had to force myself to finish it. I won't be reading anymore of the books in the series and, like another reviewer, I'll be looking for something a bit more substantial."
2,I am glad this book exists,"I am happy this book was written, as I love the HBO show. It's a great story, and one that was perfect to expand into a high quality show like True Blood. However, on its own, the book was only mildly interesting. It has a little humor, it has a variety of characters, it has some exciting parts. But overall, I was not impressed and only read it through to see if I felt differently about book Bill and show Bill. I have read the first three books so far and might skim the fourth, but I don't think I can make it much further than that. They are just a little too... simple. She doesn't take any of the qualities I listed far enough to make it really good reading.However, I am just so thankful to Charlaine Harris for writing the series, and for allowing such freedom to Alan Ball to take her stories to the next level. She deserves her success!"
5,Charlaine Harris; Dead Until Dark,"I really needed this one book, 1) It's the beginning. 2) It completed my collection. 3) It told the back story of all the characters, that wasn't in the later novels. These stories were AWESOME! Need more! More! More! :-)"
3,Sookie Stackhouse Kindle ebook availability in Australia,"Really enjoyable read, except having seen the TV series, I can't help but picture all the characters and places and the storyline itself as I've seen them on TV. Kinda spoils it as a reading experience for me. The book was good but not as riveting for me as the Anne Rice vampire books or even Bram Stoker's classic, so I've given this one only 3 stars, although I'd like to keep reading the series.The really big downer for me though is that after reading the Kindle edition, I tried to purchase the next book in the series for Kindle, and low and behold, it is not available to Australians! In fact, every Sookie Stackhouse novel can be bought by Australians in Kindle format -except-Living Dead In Dallas. Why? Does anyone actually have a logical reason? And no, Aussies can't buy any ""boxed"" set of Sookie Stackhouse novels for Kindle either. So on principle, I've stopped buying these books until this absurd situation is rectified."
5,Review of Dead Until Dark,"Having a master's degree in English and spending more than 10 years as a professional writer does not necessarily give me the qualifications to review this book. What does qualify me is that I have not read a book in at least 10 years, barring children's books, and I found myself so interested in this book that I read it in less than two days. I found this book to be exciting, original and suprising. The characters were so well developed that I felt I knew them. After reading this book, I immediately ordered the rest of the Sookie Stackhouse books. I recommend them for anyone who likes a quick read and an unexpected ending."
4,Goody - Vampires!,"Let me start off by saying that I have a thing for vampires (as she brushes the hair back from her neck). Creepy and ghoulish equals grand fun and this fangfest by Charlaine Harris did not disappoint. The fictional location of Bon Temps, Louisiana is the perfect backdrop. Many of residents themselves are a little seedy and scandalous and a haven for vampires that have ""come out of the coffin"" to live amongst mere mortals. When Bill Compton (vampire) walks into Merlotte's bar, it is all over for Sookie. The fact that she cannot hear Bill's thoughts (a disability she tries to turn off) is the nail in the casket and the affair begins. The town of Bon Temps and its locals will never be the same.This was such a fun read! I loved the characters (vampires aren't the only mystical creatures), the banter, the humor and the idea of vampires pulling up a stool right next to you and ordering a bottle of synthetic blood. And I would so be hanging out at Fangtasia!"
3,"Conscientious parents, please read this review.","This series does not appear to be marketed to teens, but I decided to read this book because I saw a lot of my 7th and 8th grade students reading books from the series. This story was very interesting. However, I do want to caution parents: 1) There is a lot of sex in this book - people talking and joking about it, vampires and people masturbating in the open, multiple detailed love scenes between the main vampire and human character, and alternate sexual relationships, 2) there is also cursing, and 3) there are also some pretty gruesome murders. I can only imagine that some of my students were reading this series because their parents didn't know these elements are in the story. So I hope this helps parents make a well-informed decision concerning the appropriateness of this series for their child."
2,Skip the book if you liked the HBO Series,"I picked this book up after watching the HBO series, True Blood, based on this book. I figured as with so many books made into television, the book would be so much better, but I couldn't have been more wrong. The book was very poorly written & differed so much from the series that I just couldn't get into it. One of the main characters in the HBO series, Sookies best friend Tara, isn't even in the books! The dialogue was horrible, Sookie was portrayed as rather uneducated in the book & seemed very shallow (after all she seemed more upset by the demise of her cat than her grandmother). I've heard that the rest of the series of books does improve, however, I'm not wasting any more money on this series. If you do decide to try this book out, do yourself a favor & borrow it from a friend or the library. DO NOT waste money on this book!"
1,Not That Good,"I was hoping for an interesting, exciting book somewhere along the lines of Laurell K Hamilton's Anita Blake series. However, I got Dead Until Dark instead. It is not only boring, but I guess I just don't like the whole southern girly-girl ""I need a big, strong, possibly undead boyfriend to take care of me"" thing. This book really was very boring, and I didn't even finish it. I don't recommend the series."
3,oK,"Well it is not bad, however it didnt keep me at the edge of my seat wanting more. I did like the sex scenes. But other than that it was just ok for me."
2,POOR EXCUSE FOR A VAMP. NOVEL,"THIS BOOK I BELIEVE IS WRITTEN FOR AGES 9-14. IT HAS A POOR STORY LINE. IT IS LIKE SHE TOOK ""ANITA BLAKE'S VAMPIRE HUNTER"" SERIES AND MADE IT SIMPLE-MINDED AND HALF-WITTED.SOOKIE STACKHOUSE HAS THE APILITY TO READ MINDS. SHE WANTS HER NEXT BOYFRIEND TO BE A VAMPIRE. BILL THE VAMPIRE MOVES INTO HER SMALL TOWN. THEY BECOME LOVERS. HER BOSS ""SAM"" IS A SHAPE-SHIFTER AND NOW WANTS HER TOO. THERE ARE A FEW MURDERS IN THE STORY BUT.....IN OVER-ALL ...IT IS PRETTY LAME."
1,"Please, for the love of anything, learn to write, Charlaine.","This book went directly to Half Price Books after I managed to choke myself through it. A talented writer Charlaine Harris is not. Her style is boring, bland, and repetitious. And her ""heroine,"" Sookie, is laughably trite, even for a telepath. Is there even a reason she has these powers? Do I care? Why does anyone, when the plot moves at a dirigible's pace? Just, no. Save yourself a few bucks and pick up a Kim Harrison novel or an older Laurell K. Hamilton. Even Karen Chance. But don't waste your money on a book that should have been given an ""F"" in Creative Writing class."
1,"I miss ""Twilight""","I finished Twilight and was looking for another vampire book... so I read this book and was terribly disappointed. I had to force myself to finish it and was soooooooo bored. I think I will just read ""Twilight"" again!"
3,Good start,"Dead Until Dark tells the story of the trials and tribulations of a mind reading waitress who falls for a vampire. The most compelling aspect of this book is that, by taming the vampire element, it does not cliche the lead vampire character. C. Harris takes an every-day-life approach to tell a vampire related story. It's a well written story that kept me turning the page. I look forward to reading the rest of the series."
4,Entertaining,"Considering its a different writing style than I'm used to, I did enjoy it.I only wish some of the descriptions were better but otherwise I enjoyed the story line and characters. Plan on reading the next book."
3,Chick book,"An adult version of the Twilight series. Stephanie Meyers quite obviously stole almost every single idea from this writer to write her own tripe. It's a wonder Ms. Meyers didn't get sued. Sookie, however, is quite a deal more likable than Bella which makes this book a much easier read."
2,This is not the television series,"I picked this book up after watching the first season of True Blood (which I loved) on HBO. I couldn't believe how weak the book was. Harris does develop interesting characters and has a vivid imagination. She just doesn't follow through with the storyline and plot development. For example, in the series when Sookie realizes who the killer is, she is in her house with him and reads his mind. She runs outside to try and escape. In the book, she is in the house, by herself, realizes that the killer is outside in the woods, and decides....to run out of the house into the woods to escape. I'm like ""what!"" It made no sense and completely destroyed the drama of the confrontation because you are still thinking ""why did she leave the house?""Obviously the television series has much better writers when it comes to plot development and dramatic writing. I've decided not to read any more of her books. But True Blood still rocks!"
1,Complete Waste of Time,"One of the worst-written books I have ever read. Though Harris' plot ideas have great potential, the superficial character development and illogical plot twists leave the reader completely disappointed. At times, the unbearably moronic dialogue and Harris' awkward word choice will literally have you cringing. I love a good guilty-pleasure novel as much as the next reader, but there is just too much well-written fiction out there to waste your time on this drivel."
3,An Easy Read,"There was nothing spectacular about the book, but it reads very quickly and explores some interesting topics fairly creatively. I read it for a book group and it was one of those books I would never have picked up on my own. While I'm not running out to get the next book in the series, I certainly would pick it up for a good vacation read next time I'm looking for something light & easy."
3,Series is better!,"I have just recently started watching the ""True Blood"" series on HBO. I find them totally irresistable! This series was based on this series of books. Based they were. I found the books to be written very elementary-like. They lack the magnetism that the series has. The series follows the book(s) very well but it is oh so much better. The book is not a complete waste of time. It will not challenge your thoughts however. Overall an o.k. read."
3,Good addition to vampire lore,"This is a good book, but I'd have to say the TV version of Sookie is much more appealing. The HBO show really took time to thing things through. The book seems rushed after watching the show. On TV, Amy, Lawfayette, Sookie, and Tara all have great stories. In the book, Tara does not exist and the others only get a paragraph or so. Good ideas and inspiration. Harris wrote what amounts to a very fine screenplay. She does have a way with words and includes a few great similes and metaphors. Other than that, this is pretty forgettable. Read only if a serious vampire or ""True Blood"" fan."
2,"For a book with a lot of death and sex, it was terribly boring.","Short and Sweet Review, by Michelle:Found this book dull...surprising considering there are multiple murders, telepathics, vampires, and tons of sex! You would think this would be the most thrilling book on the shelf, but noooope. The writing style is bland and very amateurish. In fact, I've read unedited/self published vampire novels that are a much higher caliber of writing. I didn't have high expectations (try not to anymore, since I'm hopelessly addicted to fantasy and paranormal fiction ... and there is a LOT of bad stuff out there), but I was still disappointed."
3,"Good concept, bad everything else.","I don't think I have to rehash all of the storyline, starts with a well endowed blonde waitress named Sookie who meets the dream Vampire..Bill. (Snicker.)Anyway straight to the point, as a beginning of a series it started off pretty interesting. The concept of vampires who are introduced into mainstream society. How they fit in, the reactions from the live social circles, and not to mention lots fights scenes and blood abound.It started to get a bit fast paced and uneven plot wise during the ending. People started dropping off (for a small town they sure took multiple murders in stride), and a lot of the scenarios with her boss were a bit unbelievable. An okay beginning, but I'll be honest in saying this only got 3 starts because the next book was even worse.It's skippable, and maybe with hope the t.v. series will come out more even."
4,I'm totally hooked,"I'm not even sure how I stumbled across this book, but the previous reviews convinced me to buy it - and now I'm totally hooked. I was actually so into it by the end that I was trying to read faster so I could turn the page and find out what happened next. I bought book 2 immediately after finishing this, and am on to #3. This is a great series to just get lost in. Buy it, you won't be sorry."
5,New to vampire books- and this one was awesome!,"I have just started reading vampire books- and it is a shame that it took this long for me to get into them. Dead Until Dark by Charlaine Harris was a great book. I could hardly put it down. My husband gets mad at me because my book light keeps him up at night so I hid under the covers just to read it! I couldnt wait until I was ready for bed. The character of Sookie Stackhouse is easily relatable, and I like that. Overall- I dont have anything bad to say about this book- and I am about to order the rest of the Southern Vampire Mysteries series!"
5,Fast Read!,I got hooked on True Blood on HBO and decided I needed a little more background from Charlaine Harris. The book is great. Written as a young woman would speak and very imaginative and descriptive.I enjoyed all the twists and turns and would even consider becoming a Fang Banger if given the chance!!
2,Glad I Didn't Pay Full Price,"I had little hope for this book after reading 50 pages and still not getting lost in the story. Charlaine Harris has a good idea, but she does very little with it. I got the feeling that after she wrote x number of pages she gave up and just ended the story. Unfortunately, I read her third book (Club Dead) and it's ending was more abrupt than Dead Until Dark. I wouldn't recommend any of the Sookie books to anyone who truly enjoys reading. There are much better vampire stories out there. Read one of those instead. If you just can't resist reading this series go to the library and save your money for something else."
2,Save your money,"This book just didn't work for me. The writing was appalling, a style non-existent, and the main character Sookie was simply obnoxious. In such a small town, every guy, and I mean EVERY guy, thinks she's a catch, good-looking, sexy, adorable. A woman, no matter how much she looks like a supermodel, will not get every guy. What else bothered me was the Sookie's focus on herself. Yes, she found herself incredibly sexy. Yes, she found her body utterly to die for. Yes, the writer kept reminding the reader how great Sookie is.This is one book I felt like tossing in the trash. Did so as soon as I read the last page. It really was that bad."
2,"The More I Read, the Less I Wanted To","I could not muster up the energy to finish this white trash romance between bar waitress Sookie Stackhouse and the new vampire in town, Bill Compton. I like to support local authors, but the characters were two-dimensional and the plot virtually non-existent. Perhaps the television series based on these books is better."
2,Twilight's better,Not too bad but I definately liked Twilight better. It just seemed a little too similar but did not read as quickly as the Twilight series. Don't think I'll read the rest of them...
1,Misleading sale,"I thought, by the photo of the product, that I was getting the box set. NOT just ONE book. For what I paid I could have gotten TWO books at Barns & NobelI thought I was getting a GREAT deal, $10.20 for the whole set when the set costs $63 at Barns & Nobel. But, not so. Very disappointed in how the item is represented, misleading and the first time I'm let down by Amazon."
1,Apology to fans,"I want to apologize to Harris's fans for being so blunt. This book, with deep respect for Anne Rice, could have been titled ""Intercourse with the Vampire"".Way too much talking about sex acts with the vampire that didn't need to be in a mystery.The book has potential, but, it is just not for me.After reading just over 3/4 of the book, it made Twilight look good."
4,A fun read!,"This is the first Charlaine Harris book I've read, and I've got to say I am impressed. After seeing the promos for the True Blood series, I expected a very gory, horror-filled fest, but the prose in this book flows really smoothly, and I really like the Sookie character from the beginning because she's just like so many of us - insecure and very dismissive of her own likeability.The book opens a world that seems in the beginning to be almost like ours, with one difference - vampires are officially recognized and given the right to exist alongside humans. Towards the end of the book, of course, more surreal elements are introduced, like shape-shifters and the social hierarchy among the vampires. Overall I found this book really funny and enjoyed reading it, and wonder if the later books in the series will be just as interesting."
2,disappointed,"I am a huge fan of the HBO series (True Blood)that was inspired by this series of books. I was expecting, well, so much more. I'm not a fan of books written in first person perspective anyway as characters other than the primary seem so one dimensional to me. Found the first book so disappointing that I'm sure I won't read another one."
4,Fun an fast read,"Oddly I picked this book up in a book store at least 6 years ago or so, and guess what? I put it back on the shelf! It didn't grab me the first time, but this time around, simply put, this book was great! I'm going to start with the end and work my way back. It was down to the wire, in the last 30 pages or so before the killer was revealed. I was extremely happy that the villain wasn't given away early. I usually can figure it out pretty quickly, but this time I couldn't. I even tried to remember who the villain was of True Blood season one and it totally escaped me until the end of the book, then I was like ""Oh, yea!"" I won't give anything away, but the book was definitely in line with season one of HBO's version.To read the rest of my review visit: [...]"
3,Not Dead At All,"I read Dead Until Dark after a friend suggested the series to me. I did enjoy the read, but it was not really what I expected it to be. For example, I was not expecting to read about vampire sex. I'm still undecided as to whether or not Sookie Stackhouse (Harris' main character), is a Necrophiliac or not. Vampires are dead, but not dead, so the jury is still out on that issue. Aside from that, I found the book to be an easy and fast-paced read with solid and likable characters."
1,Shoddy all round,The cap falls off and the whole thing looks fake and cheap. I think a kid would be onto it in a second.
2,Bad quality,"The head with magnet does not align with the pen's body. So when you do the trick, people can recognize it."
5,V__E__R__Y....... E D U C A T I O N A L...!,"The Magic Trick: Take a dollar bill, push a pen through it, then remove the pen....and there's NO HOLE in the dollar bill! (At least, no hole that one can see...) Is this ""trick"" government-approved? Maybe more like ""government inspired""! A great trick for ANY magic show. But especially a fine one for the amusement of the people at your next local Libertarian party chapter meeting! (More ""Trick"" than ""Magic"", I think. Sigh.... It seems SO little has changed, since the ""Tricks of MAGIC"", in Ancient Egypt....."
1,not real,"This was the biggest waste of 3$ I have ever spent. It is not magic at all. Its just 2 pieces of a pen with a magnet between them. For 3$ I was expecting real magic, like the kind I saw on Harry Potter the other day. I wish people wpould be more honest in their titles because thats all I read. It would be really magical if this pen would dissappear or turn in to a bird or something. If it at least would shoot lasers it would be cool. Life is hard."
2,Cheap,"The pen cap falls of the pen all the time,, very cheaply made, it doesnt work as smoothly as it should simply because of the cap,, it gives away the trick."
1,Not worth $10,The price was way too high for the items actual quality. I'm definitely not satisfied at all with this product.
5,Its worth it,"It works great, it is a great trick for all ages. It is a very visible, eye catching trick. I love it."
5,Thrilling Read!,After 25 years of service to the CIA Kirk McGarvey had been nominated to be the Director of the spy service.His nomination triggers a plot to assassinate that was put into place by his old arch enemy General Baranov.Baranov is reaching from hi grave to gain vengance.The assassin was brainwashed by Baranov to kill McGarvey should he ever be nominated for the Director of the CIA.Attempts are made on the life of McGarvey.his wife Katy and their daughter Elizabeth.The identity of the assassin is a shocker. This is another good book by David Hagberg.Be sure to read it.
3,3 1/2 stars,"See book description above.This is probably my least favorite Hagberg novel. It moved at a fast pace, but the main topic of brainwashed assassins going after Kirk McGarvey, the soon to be director of the CIA, just didn't seem to take my interest. Convoluted comes to mind. Maybe it's just my mood but that's what I think."
5,"A Classic of New Orleans Style Urban Hoodoo and Conjure, Circa 1920s","Anna Riva was not the author of this book; it dates to the 1920s, long before she was writing anything for publication. It fell into the public domain, so she reprinted it. The author was ""Bivins, N. D. P."" but although he attributed the work to Marie Laveau, it's not by her either (she was long dead by the 1920s and the naming of various hoodoo formulas for magical oils, as described in the text, post-dates her life). So what is it? It's a GREAT little book on conjure, hoodoo, rootwork, and African American witchcraft as practiced during the 1920s in New Orleans. It was so good that the celebrated author Zora Neale Hurston plagiarized from it in her 1935 book on hoodoo folklore in New Orleans, ""Mules and Men."" Highly recommended."
1,"Not a book, but a pamphlet.","I couldn't wait to receive my book in the mail. I came home last night and there was a small envelope leaning against my front door. I didn't remember ordering anything except the book. Well, I opened the package, and was taken aback. This book seems like an advertisement for products in a store. None of these items are in DC, and the spells, or requests from people to (supposedly) Marie Laveau aren't laid out in a comprehensive way. You have to read to tell who is speaking to whom. I wouldn't waste my money on this one. I will donate this one to the trash."
1,Black Tar and White mush!,"I have read and skimmed many magick books in my time, and this one is the worst I've ever came across. Sure, Laveau is the ""voodoo"" queen of Orleans, but Riva, the compiler of Laveau's spells, rituals, slop, whatever you want to call them, are not at all what I expected. But then again, what can you really expect for a 64 page book for only 6 something in price! Do Not get this book. There are soooo many more better ones out there. If I were a first time reader of magick books, and I purchased this, it would literally turn me off from magick, thinking it was too complicated, difficult to understand, whatever... Of course everyone just must do what they please in today's society, so if you want the book, get it. I wouldn't suggest it."
5,Great jazz piano book--one of the keepers. Excellent and improved.,"I bought this book when it first came out. Unfortunately, there were some errors in the first edition which have been corrected. I wrote to the author I was so impressed, and he wrote me back about writing the book.This is really one of the best jazz piano books ever published--telling you how to actually play a tune.I have studied jazz piano off and on since I was a teenager in the 70s using the Mehegan books (which I do not recommend--mostly because of odd chord charts and the use of Figured Bass, besides the nonsense in them never to ""roll a tenth"")I highly recommend this book, and no, I do not know the author personally nor profit from my recommendation--maybe someday.Hope this was helpful."
1,Vile,"A grave disappointment. I cast myself into the Great Pit of Squaredom, surely, by this judgement, but aside from some isolated good bits, including Southern's notes on working with Kubrick on Strangelove and his interview with Henry Green, this is a poor (unspeakable, indeed!) excuse for a collection--repetitive, full of tiresome hipster tics, willfully and wearyingly perverse, seeking shock for shock's sake, like a child misbehaving to get attention. Do not waste your time or your money on this unfortunate production. Buy a copy of The Magic Christian instead."
5,The long awaited sequel to Red Dirt Marijuana,"Hard core Terry Southern fans and first time readers alike will find much to enjoy in Now Dig This. This anthology is a wonderful distillation of uncollected and unpublished work spanning the buttoned down cool of the fifties to the post-Reagan and Bush nineties. Now Dig This offers readers a chance to rediscover Terry Southern in his many guises: as a great short story writer, master of the zany epistle, screenwriter par excellence, raconteur (his memories of working on Dr. Strangelove and staging pranks with Frank O'Hara are worth the cover price alone), critic, journalist (doing Gonzo before everyone else), and all around grand guy. For those who have become numbed out by the coopted irony of our consumerist present, it is refreshing and inspiring to back to the source. To paraphase Ringo Starr, buy a Terry Southern book today."
1,Terrible,"Im very disappointed. For the price I payed for this uniform ($100AU after shipping), it is a total waste of money. The colour faded to grey after ONE wash, the fit is more like wearing a sack, and after one session of Jui Jitsu style rolling, the supposedly heavy duty stitching ripped at the shoulder. Avoid."
5,great paper,Works great for printing black and white.have had zero issues with the paper. Photos come out clear and crisp. flat finish helps if you do make a mistake by hiding errors better than glossy paper.
1,"Product description is wrong, beware","The product description for this battery is not accurate: It claims ""7.2 volts, equivalent to Sony L-Type NP-330 and NP-550, Fits Sony MVC-CD 1000, FD-Series, DSC-F3770, and DSC-S50/S70, 1850mAh power rating"". In fact the NP-FS11 (and the equivalent that is sold) is 3.6 volts, is NOT equivalent to the Sony NP-F330 or F550, does NOT fit in the Sony FD-Series (it's much smaller than the NP-F330 I was replacing), and the one I received was 1350 mAh.I don't know how they could give this product description for this item. I have notified Amazon and they said they would correct the page but so far have not done so.I'd stay away until they figure out just what it is they are selling."
1,Warning - it does not fit Sony camera DCS-P30,My Sony camera DSC-P30 uses Sony InforLITHIUM battery (NP-FS11). My camera rejected this equivalent battery made by Polaroid. The camera went into automatic shutdown after indicating non-Sony InfoLITHIUM battery is used.
2,Average at best,"Rick James is One of My All-time Favorites.the Cat is Underrated to me.but this Set was the Watered down version of Him that had been going for a few years for Him.His one knock out Jam on Here is ""Lucy's Rap"". that One Cut alone is worth the price alone.tight Groove&Simple&to the Point.the title Cut is pretty good but after that it's run of the mill."
3,True Crime?,"Ellis Parker seems to have been a fascinating individual, a pioneering rogue detective whose overreaching methods eventually got the best of him. I had high hopes for this book but was a little disappointed after I got a copy. It's a good read but I find little here that hasn't been covered in previous writings on the Lindbergh case and listing among the suspects Arnold Rothstein (who was murdered in 1928, long before the Lindbergh baby was even born) makes me question the depth of the research here. Also, the author's admission at the beginning of creating fictional dialogue throughout the book to me negates much of its value as either history or true crime. That convention of inventing conversation in a supposed nonfiction work went out of style years ago and was never justifiable in the first place. Beyond these reservations it's still a worthwhile read for anyone interested in early 20th Century crime and criminology."
2,Not impressed,"I've been hearing about Wilson A2000 gloves for years. After finally buying one, I must say I'm disappointed. I bought this for my son for Christmas. After taking it out of the box, the first thing you notice is the stiffness of the leather. I guess this is a good thing in the long run, but I just wasn't prepared for how long this would take to break-in. Right away, I started oiling it, and tying it up and playing ""catch"" with myself. I figured I'd better get going if my kid going to be able to use it by spring. Here I am in June, and it's still not broken in well. He mostly used his cheap, too small for him glove that I bought 3 years ago. Other complaints: 1 - the ""Dial-Fit System"" broke very early on. It seemed like a cheap gimmick for an expensive glove. 2 - Wilson's service is a joke. When I tried to contact someone about the broken ""Dial-Fit"", I was given the run-around. Then they just stopped responding. Nice way to treat a customer."
1,Shipping not careful,"received item 5 days after ordering. upon opening package, noticed bottom of box was crushed. pulled item out of box & the 2 front door visors were completely cracked in half, one with chip in lower corner"
4,Fun and informative.,"North Carolina From Sea to Shining Sea is a wonderful book for children. It's full of basic information about the state of North Carolina and its history. It also has many beautiful photographs and drawings and an interesting map covered with points of interest, leading crops and industry. Also included is a ""gallery of famous Tarheels"" (though they left out the beautiful and talented Ava Gardner) and some trivia. North Carolina From Sea to Shining Sea is a fun book for kids to learn a little about the great state of North Carolina."
1,headache of a printer,"This was a gift for christmas,the printer constantly states it is jammed no matter if you are using the printer or copier. About 20% of the time it will work now if I can figure out that 20%. The main reason i hang on to it besides the fact it was free is that the scanner has proven useful."
2,AWFUL,I bought this printer two years ago. It started out wonderful but then the paper kept getting jammed up. Now it keeps saying out of paper when there is paper in it. I now have to hand feed it to print anything. I'm selling in at a yard sale this weekend and will invest in a new one.
5,Wonderful!!,"This product is great in that your hands, and wherever else you choose to use it is will feel soft and you'll smell wonderful. The scent is not overpowering and it's a great addition to the perfume of the same name. It's very feminine and last all day. I get compliments on this all the time. I'm always asked ""what perfume are you wearing?"" Men and woman both love it. I never leave home without a spritz or two and a dab of this creme on my hands. Thanks Amazon for making this and the perfume available at half the cost at fine department stores. This makes a great gift especially if you choose the ""gift set"" that has several items in it. I can't say enough good things about this particular Vera Wang scent."
1,Amazon refund process a nightmare - buy in a real store,"This was the wrong product for my wife, so it was returned for a refund. The refund amount credited was incorrect and there started my trek for help. Multiple emails to Amazon with no resolution (even though Amazon acknowledged the error). The agent at the 1-866-464-8787 phone number said they could NOT help me. Called 800-201-7575 and was connected to a NON-native English-speaking agent in INDIA. She was finally able to help me after a week or two of unproductive calls and emails. However, I barely could understand what she was saying. Only her follow-up email (thank you!) allowed me to understand. My suggestion: if you purchase an item where a return might be possible, don't use Amazon."
2,Would the real Hank Jr. please stand!!!,"When will Jr. realize country radio is not interested anymore! The sooner he realizes this, the sooner he will put out a CD with substance! The self-parodies also get old. The one song I did enjoy was, ""I Like It When It's Stormy."" The only reason I give it 2 stars."
1,Is It possible to give less than one star?,"Well after I bought this new Hank Jr album i went back to my trailer, took off the belt buckles and boots, and played the tape as loud as I could on my new Stereo I bought at a garage sale. All I could think of was what the hell happened to my beer. I could have sworn I placed my case of Coors light next to my Skoal. Son of a ***, I bet the damn kids took it. Those little pricks, not only is my Coors light gone but I am now listening to some of the biggest rooty poot music since the late Merle Haggard stuff. Damnit, a case of Coors light would make this album so much better."
4,hank williams jr stormy,i like the cd very good but took to long to ship and didnt tell me why. A little fustrating!!
5,Country Music's Redemption,"I have been a faithful country music fan for about 20 years and a Bocephus fan for the same. I have a hard time listening to country radio because of their abandonment of the artist who brought country music where it is today. Hank Jr has for years set the standard to which all others should strive to be. There have been some lean years for Bocephus, critically at least. I have all of his albums and I think they are all wonderful. Some are better than others. Stormy however, is a re-birth of the Hank jr that ruled all of music in the early/mid 80's. Way to go Hank. P.S. His concerts are the best of any artist on this earth."
2,Too many processed ingredients,"While I have found a couple of recipes in this cookbook that I enjoy, too many of them call for processed, preservative-laden ingredients. Any cookbook that calls for using cream-of-whatever condensed soup in a recipe is one to be avoided."
4,The one I turn to again and again!,"I've had this cookbook for 6 1/2 years and it's stained, spotted and spattered! I use it so much! After reading some of the negative reviews I just had to add my two cents. Granted, some of the recipes are truly horrid, but you'll find bad eggs in any cookbook you buy. My favorites are the Red Bean Beef Chili and the Caribbean Chicken with Bananas. Practically everything I've made has turned out delicious. The author has excellent information on crock-pot cookery at the beginning (including how to add the best flavor to your food--always saute onions first! and why crockpots are safe). I had another crockpot cookbook but gave it away because I never used it."
1,The Best Slow Cooker Cookbook Ever,I went through the entire book page by page and did not find one recipe that sounded good enough to even try. It was a real disappointment!
1,Worst Slow Cooker Cookbook Ever!,There are many much better slow cooker cookbooks out there...Mabel Hoffman's for example. I made two recipes from this book and both were barely edible. The combination of ingredients in most of the recipies are enough to prompt a gag reflex! ... Do yourself a favor and look into buying a different slow cooker book.
2,Misleading title,"If this is the best slow cooker cookbook ever, the previous ones must have been pretty bad."
1,My dog wouldn't touch the food from this book!,This cookbook was a real disappointment. We've tried 5 or 6 recipes and none of them were any good. My husband started calling my crockpot the crap-pot because the recipes from this book were so bad. Even our dog refused to eat the chili from this cookbook.There are many other good cookbooks out there for crockpot recipes. Stay away from this one!!
3,Good but does not serve the purpose of a slow cooker for me,"Although this book has some great recipies, I found that many of them took only 3-5 hours of cooking. The whole reason I use a slow cooker is to put everything into the pot before I leave for work and have it ready when I get back, at least 8 hours later. If the cooking time is 3 hours, the recipe is of no use to me."
5,"GREAT cookbook! Easy, tasty, and convenient!","A must for crock pot lovers or those who want to try out a new method of cooking! I love one-pot-meals & I love this cookbook! I have lots of cookbooks but use only 2 of them on a regular basis...one of them is an out of print ""One Pot Meals"" cookbook I picked up at a used bookstore and the other is this book! Easy and tasty recipes that are great for a busy lifestyle. Even the desserts turn out great and are easy to do!"
2,EXPENSIVE FOR DAILY USE,I bought this and found it was not what it seemed.I would have to use 3 or 4 of these to mop my entire home and it doesnt leave the floorsclean.Wasted my money.
2,Dust Bunnie's vs. Dust Rabbitt's,"It May Work Well If All You Need Is A Light Dusting, Any Heavy Dusting, The Fiber's Are Too Short."
5,I Love this Mop Too!,"This is the best mop for wood floors. It's gentle, yet gets shoe scuffs and dried food off the floor. And match it with a great wood cleaner such as non-toxic Murphey's Oil Soap, and your good to go. I think the previous person that said they got streaks used an inferior floor cleaner. I would not hesitate to buy this mop again for myself, or as a gift for my relatives."
1,bad,this game is awful. i gave it 2 stars becuz i like the person that bought it for me... ok nevermind i had to take my other star back.
2,Recent Pretenders comparisons are overblown,"I remember seeing this band live in Portland and it was inspiring...so what the hell happened? This album sounds like it was over-processed through the Corporate Rock, Inc. grinder; they have lost all the edge and spark that once was this groups trademark. They forgot where their roots are and what rock was meant to be... too polished for my taste."
5,GO FAST AND TURN LEFT !,If you were aroung during this period you will relive the real dirt racers of our past. If you are new to racing and want to see what some of the greats had to drive to survive this book will help.
2,Read the fine print before you buy!,"It does not work on any Sony unit that normally uses a wireless remote. You must have a certain subtype only disclosed in the fine print of the owners manual. Needless to say but it did not work for mine, and the type of blister packaging doesnt allow for an accepted return. Good idea to have piece like this, but poor integration into only a part of their head unit selection."
5,great remote,"this remote from sony is a great peace of work, the functions, the size, the versatility, all awesome, the bad part is its a Hi R remote not IR ,which is not compatible with all sony stereos, there is a list of compatible stereos on sony's web site ,i wish sony would make the same remote in IR."
5,Superb performance,"I can`t say enough about this amazing account of the Pastoral symphony.The Philharmonia`s violins sound as sweet as heaven. And the sound!! Incredible clarity from a very early Decca cd (1983).Often, the first movement is played a little too fast (ex-Bernstein`s 80`s version on DG), and at times, quite ploddingly. Yet here, the 13:30 time is just right.The imaginative cover depicting Beethoven on a stamp is quite nifty, considering the usual blandness of most classical music cd covers.The last movement is the highlight of this cd. Ashkenazy conveys such warmth and serenity here.The only snag is that the last 3 movements, 19 minutes total, have been lumped onto one track. Therefore, there are only 3 tracks to the whole symphony.5 stars for the performance, 4 stars for the layout."
4,Cultural diversity adds depth to the cops and robbers genre.,"Sam Watchman, the Navajo cop who cracks this case, appears to be the precursor of a more well known Joe Leaphorn or Jim Chee of Tony Hillerman fame. Watchman is relentless (pun intended) in his pursuit of bank robbers whose plane has crashed in the high mountains of the Southwest. Although the criminals, as former ""commandos,"" are specialists in the art of destruction and murder they may have met their match when they meet up with Watchman. This is far more than a simple good guy/bad guy chase: this is the collision of diverse cultures in a hostile environment. As they have before and since, Garfield's talents as a writer add depth and insight to a field often replete with cliche."
3,Really protects but...,"I have this case but mine is from Superman. Really protect your ipod from scratches and you can access the controls on a easy way. Here is the bad thing, is you want to take out the case is so damn difficult you may spend like 15 to 30 minutes to take your ipod out."
5,Big brother to the 3/8,Get one and you will never go back any other brand. This is a true nutbuster.
5,Recommend,Bought this from amazon.com within the first week tested it out and it was great. It is very powerful. Haven;t tried to remove my honda crankshaft pulley bolt or axle nut off yet but overall this is strong compare to Craftsman Impact wrenches.Recommend Excellent Product
5,Excellent product,"I'm a mechanic and use the AIRCAT every single day!! I love the light weight, the low noise and the power is equal to my old ingersol rand231. I will definately buy more AIRCAT stuff in the future."
5,Works great,I've only had this gun for a few days but so far it has worked wonderfully. I have not been in any sticky situations where I had to really work it. It has broken every fastener loose with a tap of the trigger and I've only used the low power setting to tighten things so far. I imagine it will be every bit as powerful and reliable as the comparable IR model costing twice as much.
2,Not what I expected,I bought this based on the reviews. I was replacing a CP impact wrench and was considering an IR thundergun. Then I found this Aircat 1000 with 1000 ftlbs of reverse torque at about $60 less. My CP has only 450. This does not have much more. I started with my lightweight air hose that i use with nail guns and 90lbs of pressure on my compressor. It wouldn't losen the lug nuts on my one ton pickup...so..I went to a bigger air hose and increased the air pressure to 120lbs psi. Then it seemed to have more torque than my CP version but nothing special and clearly no where near twice as much. I should have sent it back but now it has been used. I am very disappointed
4,Cool small ring,"The ring is indeed small, but what do you expect from a 1/4 carat ring? It looks good and the diamond is clear and sparking. The base is a little bit too high so it doesn't match well with my band. But compared to the price I paid for, it's a good deal."
3,great sparkle.. small size,"i bought this ring because i have 5/8 k earings (which brings it to about 1/4 k per piece)... so, i thought i could match them.. this diamond is ABSOLUTELY smaller than the earings, but it is obvious that the ring is much thicker (deeper cone shape, where the earings are much flatter). I don't think that THAT makes up for the HUGE difference.. anyway, it is worth mentioning that the picture GROSSLY misrepresents the ring. They probably took a picture of a 1 K diamond and pasted it on the 1/4 k item.."
5,Beautiful ring at a great price!,"I purchased this to replace my wedding ring I lost 2 years ago. I have 2 in diapers and have to watch what I spend, so I've been looking off and on for years.The only thing I wish is the stone was bigger, but who doesn't, lol.The diamond is very colorful. There is one small inclusion, but it's not that obvious. I would certainly recommend this to anyone looking for a beautiful ring on a budget."
2,Smaller than the photo,"I made a comparison with the photo and:Amazon shows that the diamond reaches the base, not in reality, there is a space.The diamond is smaller."
5,"5,000 color photos with pages of values","For over thirty years Antique Trader's ANTIQUES & COLLECTIBLES PRICE GUIDE has been the weighty resource of collector choice, providing black and white and color keys to every collecting category. Glassware, ceramics, furniture, dolls and toys, and more are all included: over 5,000 small color photos provide excellent detail and quality, while pages of the latest values make ANTIQUE & COLLECTIBLES 2006 PRICE GUIDE particularly valuable for avid garage-sale goers."
1,Inane,Strange how she pigeon-holes the dispensational-premillenalist christian-right as being the anti-gay force in this nation. As an amillenial Roman Catholic who is equally opposed to the anti-human homosexual agenda...I am offended and consider myself the subject of discrimination! I'm sure that my Eastern Orthodox and traditional Mainstream Protestant bretheren concur
5,Great Stuff,"On this record, McLaughlin showed early on that he can play gorgeous music -- music that's not just for guitar freaks. Ignore the frantic and often self-indulgent electric stuff he's done with Mahavishnu Orchestra, etc. Here he's subdued, and plays a unique blend of blues, jazz and Indian-inspired acoustic music. It's great background music; it's also great listening music. The best version of ""Goodbye Porkpie Hat"" since Mingus, Jeff Beck notwithstanding. He throws in a Miles Davis song, two longish Indian tunes and a tribute to Bill Evans -- a thoughtful, gorgeous record."
5,Top-notch acoustica,"This album features mixed ensemble and solo pieces from a deep,transcendental Mclaughlin.The stirring, opening tracks may be the culmination of his spiritual directions.""Goodbye ..."" is a solid cover. ""Blue in green"" fulfills its intriguing title."
5,Worth the import price!,"The two peace songs are outstanding and I wish it would go on for a full 40 min instead of 19 minutes. Maybe someday they will find the original tapes and reissue them in a longer format or with the outtakes.Although John on acoustic guitar is great and encouraging throughout the peace songs, it is Jerry Goodman and his electric violin marriaged with the Eastern instruments and imitated by the clarinet, which is so captivating.I agree with the other reviewer about their island CD for it is also mine, along with Pharoh Sanders ""The Creator has a Master plan"" (minus the 8 min. of noise& chaos that I successfully cut out) leaving that song also, a 30 minute master piece."
5,One of the all time greatest!,"The two peace songs are outstanding and I wish it would go on for a full 40 min instead of 19 minutes. Maybe someday they will find the original tapes and reissue them in a longer format or with the outtakes.Although John on acoustic guitar is great and encouraging throughout the peace songs, it is Jerry Goodman and his electric violin marriaged with the Eastern instruments and imitated by the clarinet, which is so captivating.I agree with the other reviewer about their desert island CD for it is also mine, along with Pharoh Sanders ""The Creator has a Master plan"" (minus the 8 min. of noise& chaos that I successfully cut out) leaving that song also, a 30 minute master piece."
2,doesnt match whats pictured,"the ball that was recieved doesnt match the picture in the desciption. the ball recieved was a replacement 2 5/16"" replacement for a goose neck hitch. is pin type not threaded with nut like picture"
3,Don't Buy,"Don't buy this book that a racist has written.Pretty shameful that this author would use his past of being in the Third Reich to try and make money. Though it may be a fascinating story, the author should accept responsibility for his own judgments. Granted Hitler dupled many into supporting him with the propaganda campaign. But that doesn't justify this author or any others that participated in genecide. Didn't even have the decency to apologize on Discovery Channel's Unsolved History special.Shame on you Armin."
5,Sampler 1,This music is both soothing and haunting to the soul but in a beautiful way! I enjoy listening to it very much.
5,great characters and great battles,A great new series off to a good start. The premise of the long lost hero whose legacy has gotten badly distorted is a bit far fetched literary device but the story hangs together anyway. The battles are very cool!
2,100 Words or Less,"[This review is for the first 3 books of the Lost Fleet series.]""Dauntless"" starts with a rush and then settles down into the nuts and bolts of large-scale naval ... I mean ... space warfare. At first, it seems interesting, though a bit shallow.However, ""Fearless"" and ""Courageous"" add nothing to the first novel. It's obviously a one-trick concept: formatted battles with confusing geometrical formations and victory against all odds. The same character emotions over and over. A beauty (or curse?) of e-readers is the ability to search key phrases; in these novels the same sentences are repeated over and over. That's lazy writing.So, good beginning. Then, monotonous retread."
4,3.5 Stars: Anabasis meets the Arthur Myth in Outer Space,"This is a solid and competently written space opera. Campbell draws on one of the versions of Arthur (reproduced in a number of European countries) myth in which a sleeping hero from the past reawakens in a time of peril. He couples this element with a version of Xenophon's Anabasis, in this case a space fleet caught in enemy space far from home. After the hero has taken command of the leaderless fleet, he begins to lead them on the perilous way home. Campbell's hero, Jack Geary, is a decent and competent man struggling with the burdens of command and with the burden of being a mythic figure. His competence and adherence to the traditions of his service provide the means for him lead his new subordinates."
4,"Little bit of Heinlein, Little bit of Hornblower, Lots of good fun.","Great introduction to a new (to me) universe in which the hero starts off on the losing side and brings the good old ways back to build a winner. At once shows the development of the central figure and of those that surround him as they each influence the other. Sets up the glimmering of several questions, why did the war start, why can't it be ended, and who are these third party guys? Altogether a thoughtful piece, maybe a little too extravagant in space battle description for me, but good character development and nice construction throughout. I can hardly wait for the next volume to be delivered."
4,Review of Dauntless,"It is hard to find good science fiction, but this book is above average. The story line is interesting and the characters are very real. It keep moving along at a good pace. It contains a sense of military traditions that reminds me of Star Treck. I would recommend it."
3,A good adventure story,"Camapbell is a good writer, and he skillfully tells a tale that draws the reader in. I read this book quickly, eager to find out what would happen next. It was a satisfying and entertaining story. It is simply a science fiction adventure tale, without pretensions.This story is told through the eyes of the protagonist, Black Jack Geary, who commands a fleet of ships. There is a lot of action in this book, and some suspense. Geary operates at the command level, however, and although interesting, you see the battles from a distance, which removes some of the impact.Geary has no peers or equals in the fleet, and he can't really confide in anyone. This limits the ability of the reader to know or care for any other character. You understand his thoughts and feelings, but every other character in the book is thinly drawn. I can't describe this as a true cliff hanger. Still, It would be a good book for an plane trip. I enjoyed it enough to recommend it."
4,Great story,"Excellent book, it starts out fast and keeps going.It's a sci-fi story a lot like the story of the Ten Thousand Greeks trapped far from home. They have to fight their way home. Fight against enemies and among themselves.Great book, the second one is nearly as good, ""as good"" would have been tough.I look forward to the third installment eagerly."
2,"Fleet logistics, battlefield ethics and dimensionless characters","Halfway through the book I realized that nothing had happened; the fleet is still crippled and demoralized, there has been zero character development and the author has yet to even figure out the main conflict of the story. At the time I gave up the protagonist what fuming that his battered and exhausted crew wasn't interest in sparing the lives aboard a surrendered vessel. There is no prescient sense of motivation in the story, the main character is supposed to be focused on getting the fleet home and spends seemingly dozens of pages dressing down individual captains for not obeying him well enough or failing to live up to his moral standards or whining about not having their acceptance or bemoaning his overwhelming circumstances. When I realized that the author was still writing the series without resolving the current arc, I spared myself any further of his terrible pacing."
2,A good idea poorly executed,"I bought this first book in this series on the strength of the idea. I'm always on the lookout for good military SF, but these stories disappoint.The characters are shallow and not very credible and the story reads like a high school students accounting of the cliques in their class.If you're a person who likes military SF and appreciates the work of authors like David Drake stay away from these - they'll drive you nuts."
3,"Well written, enjoyable, over-priced Space Opera","Well written and enjoyable to read. Based purely on that, I would give it 4 stars. When the price is taken into account, however, it is not a good value.I am not a slow reader, but I am not a speed reader either. This book only took me 5.5 hours to read! Most kindle books this short only cost around $6. For this one to cost $8.40 ($7.99 + tax) is absurd! I am guessing the publisher made the author split ""the book"" into two (or maybe even three?) parts so they could boost their profits."
2,Interesting 'universe' but disappointing execution,"Like many, I'm sure, my interest was peaked by the cover and the brief description on the back. But I found myself finishing the book out of sheer dogged determination. While the universe the author creates is interesting and full of potential I was very disappointed in the execution. To me it felt like the author's first book. The characters never seemed natural to me. Much of the military interaction seemed like something someone would put together if they'd gotten their info second or third hand. I just found myself regularly scowling at dialogue and actions that seemed to make no sense for the characters. Maybe I've just been spoiled by too much David Weber. It may be OK for light reading, but don't expect anything truly engrossing. I couldn't bring myself to go beyond the first book, so it way well have improved in later volumes."
3,Disappointing,"The book was fine. It sounded a lot more interesting than it was. The story is not compelling, but it is reasonably well-written and the characters are not completely shallow. I probably won't buy the next books in the series unless I am totally desperate. I simply see no reason to. Will the Lost Fleet get home? Of course. So what's the point of reading the other books?"
4,Not recommended for anybody over the age of 16,"To be fair the rating I gave for the book does not consider that as an adult I consider this pure drivel. My rating is for the teens or under that this book is more suited for. If you are an adult looking for military Sci-Fi I would skip this. I like a little challenge, intriguing ideas and concepts, this book has none of that.If you are an early teen or younger then this is quite possibly something that you would enjoy but if you are an adult or in your late teens you have been warned and don't blame me for the time you wasted reading Dauntless."
2,Unreadable....,"So, this is what I do...I see a group of books by a SF author posted on the Web, so I download them. I then check them out in Amazon to see what other learned bibliophiles have to say about them by reading a selection of five-star to one-star reviews. In the case of the Jack Campbell, the positives outweighed the negatives in my mind, so I decided to load up my e-reader with all six of the original series and give it a shot.I should have focused on the one-star reviews...I could not get beyond page 50. It is worth paraphrasing other, more eloquent reviewers:""...it was just too basic for me to enjoy.""""...dialogue was not believable and became downright PAINFUL to read..."".""... Its written more like a B movie script, than a good Sci-Fi series.""and finally from reviewer Dubarnik; ""There are too many well-written and entertaining books waiting to be read for me to waste my time on this. I'm out.""Well-stated, Sir. I too, am out."
3,"Clunky, humorless and forced.","Yes, I'm giving this book 3 stars even though I thought it was clunky, humorless and forced. I thought the concept was very intriguing and really looked forward to digging into this series. After the first couple of chapters-- and the heavy-handed, stilted dialogue and uninteresting and repetitive introspection of the protagonist-- I just kind of gritted my teeth and kept going until the end. I didn't enjoy the writing but wanted to see how the story played out.As the author gets more comfortable with the story I suppose it's possible the next book in the series may be better written than this one. That said, I don't see myself signing on for another book."
3,"Great idea, weak characters & dialogue","This isn't a bad book, it just isn't very memorable. The set up is great, a little BSG'ish but hey BSG was a little Wagon Train-ish right? The main detractor here is the weak characters and dialogue. Both keep the book from becoming one worth ""staying up late to read"". Maybe it's because I have read a lot of scifi, but nothing in this book surprised me, it plays out exactly as you expect it would. I also wish we would see the story for more POv's, everything happens from Geary's POV & in fact, the action never really leaves the Dauntless.I might be tempted to read the next book in the series down the line, but... not anytime soon."
4,Good read but not great.... BUY it though....,This book is well paced and almost great all the way through. It never really gets there for me and it begins and ends funky. I can't compare this book to any except maybe Talent For War by Jack McDevit which is a better book but similar. I'd rather have my space operas from the likes of Rick Shelly or David Weber but this is a good read in a world of series so I would recommend it
1,"Good for Younger Readers, but Avid Readers Should Stay Away","Let me see if I can sum this book up: Situation involving enemy comes up, let us now speculate for many pages as to what to do. Resolve, Rinse, and repeat. Deal with reluctant constituents by holding in anger. I wish I would have found this book in middle school but it was just too basic for me to enjoy. I hope I don't sound arrogant I just think after one has read for a while there is an inevitable progression. If you have graduated high school you probably won't like this one."
2,Oh Arrgghhh!,"A) With those names, the Fleet sounds like it just steamed in from Jutland. B) If you have a system-wide view of the battlefield, why do you need cruisers? And without submarines or torpedo boats, who needs destroyers? C) And for Ares sake, why battlecruisers? They were a mistake the*first* time around! They'd better be built like German BCs, which were designed to be in the LoB. D) If the hyperlink nets were limited to the side that erected them and space holes were forgotten, how did the two sides ever meet in battle? E)The weaponry and tactics sound more like Trafalgar than Jutland, Geary's first battle being an update of Nelson's breaking the Franco-Spanish line there. Bah, Humbug! Oh, and no nukes???"
2,Disappointing,"I ordered this book after the good reviews here. Unfortunately I am deeply disappointed. The material in this book qualifies only for a good short story. The author has stretched this good essence with repetitions and dumb dialog. It is like those cheap Sci-Fi channel TV series such as Eureka and Stargate Atlantis.The dialogs are setup to lead to ""Sci-Fi"" ideas, but in such an obvious and lengthy way that finally when it comes you have already lost your interest.Sadly this seems to be the trend in most of the recent Sci-Fi books I read. If you have read one of the great classics such as Arthur C. Clarke's Rama, you would know what I mean."
1,"One main interesting idea, but not worth the time","This most interesting part of this book is the idea that in widely distributed space battles the limit of light speed makes tactical and strategic planning and direction difficult. You get all that in the first couple of chapters.Once you're done processing that the rest of the book is bad. The characters are predictable and one-dimensional, even given that their behavior is implausible, the 'science' is inconsistent, the tactics explored are uninteresting and implausible, and the larger conflict is also implausible given the actions of the characters in the book.I'd recommend avoiding this book. Instead read some Weber, Pournelle, Ringo, Resnick, Drake, Bujold, some of Heinlein's Mil SF, or even Scalzi. If you've already read all those then take a walk or watch a movie or some such instead of reading this book.The sequel is even worse."
2,"Idiocracy in space, without the humor","This story had a pretty cool premise, but it totally fell flat. A military officer wakes up after 100 years and is put in charge of a fleet that's run by a bunch of whiny, stubborn morons straight out of a Dilbert strip (by the end of the story I started rooting for the other side, since so many of the ""good guys"" suck so badly and the bad guys are hardly flushed out at all). The plot is consumed by the hero's angst over frustrating personnel decisions and the overblown legend of his past deeds. Guess what--if the hero is constantly frustrated and annoyed, the reader is going to be constantly frustrated and annoyed.There were no twists to keep me on my toes; everything just got wrapped up with a big space battle that had virtually no tension. The story left me with no desire to pick up the next book in the series."
4,Good start to the series,"I enjoyed this debut novel in the series, but I'm a sucker for the reluctant hero. The relativistic travel and battle scenes were a bit much to get used to, and the repetitiveness of the explanations were somewhat annoying. However, the storyline was a good one, the characters were well done in my opinion, and I thoroughly enjoyed hearing all about the exploits of ""Black Jack"" Geary and the Lost Fleet."
3,Fantastic,My first e book a good read looking forward to the next in the series jack Campbell has the ability to hold your attention
2,A Stupid Premise,"The whole idea that as a war continues, tactics and strategies devolve makes no sense to me. Our main character is thawed out after being in a rescue pod for 100 years. He is the only one who knows any other tactics beyond a Highland Charge. It might make sense if they were at peace for countless generations and forgot how to fight. However, the rational is that the losses of officers were so high that battle tactics had been forgotten.These folks are building space ships but can't read books on battle tactics. These folks have been fighting a war for a few generations and don't teach their kids how to fight. It simply defies logic.These books do a great job of dealing with the speed of light and how if affects ship to ship combat."
3,Hmmmm,"I wanted to like this book, I really did. I have always been a sucker for last stands, reluctant heros, and desperate escapes and this book has them all, there is only one problem, it doesn't fit togeater all that well.Captain ""Black Jack"" Geary is apparently the only person in this fleet with half a brain as he manages to lead it safely from the clutches of the evil Syndic worlds. Character development is almost non existant and none of the characters are even given physical descriptions, you never even find out how many ships are in Black Jack's fleet, or what those ships even look like. Pretty much all the dialogue is taken up with tactics, crew squabbles and Geary endlessly going on about his ansestors and what a bunch of morons the Alliance has become over the last 100 years.I wanted to like it, and I did, but not as much as I expected to."
4,Should be a trilogy - not a 6 book series,"I read the first four books in about 3 weeks. They are enjoyable, if you can put up with all of the repetitions. For example, every book talks about Captain Geary's century long hibernation; and every book explains how the virtual conference room works. It's like the author thinks readers are going to jump into the series without first reading book 1.Dauntless and Fearless should have been combined into book 1. Courageous and Valiant should have been combined into book 2. Then the final 2 books should be book 3.The cover art also bothers me. Every book has Captain Geary dressed up as if he were a marine. At no time in all 4 books did he carry a gun!"
3,A decent military scifi book,"I'm giving this a solid three stars which might appear be a bit generous compared to my usual reviews. In any case the main character is believable with some internal struggles and doubt for change rather than those poor imitations of Bestermen many authors are churning out. That's what moved it up to three stars for me. A little too much black and white with the disenting elements, but I can live with that as it kept the story tight and fast. I would like to see some of the back story covered especially how the various space navies got to their current level of abilities."
5,Thoughtful Military Science Fiction,"The reason I keep rereading this story and series is the thought used to make it a reasonable universe was well done. A great deal of thought went into weapons, tactics and economics. The one serious flaw is that the Alliance Fleet did NOT use it's weapons to devastate the Syndic home world. I think the author reasoned that that kind of retaliatory strike would have unbalanced the story line too much. I loved the 'isolated and lost systems and worlds he created'. Thanks, Harry!"
3,Interesting story line - falls short on delivery,"I thought the book had an interesting story line, and didn't have any problem staying engaged throughout the book. An annoyance I did notice (that gets worse in books 2,3, and 4) is that about half the book focuses on the main characters dilemma of living up the expectations of a heroic historic figure come back to life. That, coupled with the boring and poorly written love triangle, over use of main characters referring to themselves in the third person will leave you betting to be jettisoned out of the nearest airlock.I'm a huge fan of this author's short stories, and that is probably what this book should have been. My best summary of this book is 150 pages of great story, 150 pages of unbelievable characters and monotonous dialog."
2,The Characters Have No Character,"The story itself is somewhat intriguing. I wanted to read the next book to see what happened. However, I can't bring myself to do it because the characters are all so frustratingly one-dimensional. All but one. The main character is the only believable character in the book. Everyone else is extremely one-dimensional, and most are very simple-minded. Even captains of starships behave as if they have no sense or capability for reasoning. They remind me of Worf on Star Trek: The Next Generation. No matter what the situation, Worf's response was always ""We should attack!"" If some of the secondary characters could be developed with the depth that the main character has, the book would be much more interesting to read."
5,Leadership Primer,"I've been a big John Hemry fan as I teach Behavioral Sciences and Leadership at a military academy. Hemry (writing as Jack Campbell here) always gets both the military feeling and moral magnitude spot on. In this book, however, he really nails the importance of leadership and followership in a way I haven't seen before. In a story about a great man, he disassembles the ludicrous notion of Great Man Leadership Theory and shows that leadership is about effort, forethought, and your relationship with your followers. I have recommended this to my students in my Leadership class as an illustration of what goes wrong with the wrong person at the top, and how they can each turn things around if they work hard enough. Yes, the moral imperatives are there--as with all Hemry's books he shows that leadership without ethical considerations is by definition, empty.Oh yeah, and it's a GREAT read! Can't wait for the next in this series!"
3,luisa.,"a refreshing blend of merengue- and salsa-latin pop, luisa is more likely to be compared to artists such as lisette melendez and fe than to the likes of alexa, albita or india. this party-ready release slows down only slightly on ""nadie"" and, then again, on ""amándote y ser amada""; otherwise, it's a perfectly viable option for your next fiesta or while you're getting ready to hit the clubs. it remains to be seen whether luisa will be able to distinguish herself among the current crop of would-be divas vying for a lasting career in the world of latin music, but she certainly has what it takes to hold her own against several of her contenders."
5,"Refrescante y Juvenil, nueva interprete de musica tropical","Luisa...una gran produccion discografica. El disco es uno bien completo y variado. Tiene una mezcla de ritmos tropicales con house y pop. El tema ""Me Enamoro Mas"" creo que es el mejor del disco, pero todos y cada uno de los temas son buenisimos. El merengue de Luisa se parece un poco al merengue romantico de Jessica Cristina y Tonny Tun Tun. Se lo recomiendo!"
3,a nice start.,"I agree with the others. Me enamoro mas is one of the better songs. I don't know if this cd is a bit ""elementary"" it does have some good tracks on it, but nothing that I would call, taking my breath away. It is a decent cd for such a young artist. I would more likely compare her style to Thalia, Noelia, and a bit of Olga. ? :-) check the songs out though!Q"
1,Broken Base,"The Assemblage of the Crystal Sphere: A D&D; Story: 1 out of 10: This is a film about five people playing a five-year D&D; campaign. The film seems shot in real time. That is, it consists of people rolling dice and well talking; for an hour and a half. Yup' (Sounds of fingers tapping)Okay let me deconstruct this a little. The filmmakers claim this is a mockumentary, unfortunately the mock part is so subtle as to be, well non-existent. So instead, you have five people you do not know, playing an D&D; game, you aren't a member of. It is worse than those celebrity poker shows'. Much worse.I am really starting to think there is not any flotsam that you can capture with a digital video camera nowadays that you cannot call an 'indie' film. A store security tape might have made a better movie than this nonsense."
4,Definitely a must see for the AD&D gamer,"I gotta say.. well done. I do believe the fact that I use to play 2nd edition really helped me as a viewer.I found this to be very funny... I enjoyed the references to other sci fi genres... I nearly spit my coffee out when one of the primary characters mentioned Jean-Luc. LOL.The group dynamics are spot on. The role-playing is spot on. If you ever played D&D; and enjoyed it, you will enjoy this film. However, I doubt this film is for your average TGIF viewer. But for some reason, I don't think 221 intended this film for everyone."
2,Not a movie,"This is not a movie per se. It's a mockumentary.Has it's moments, but if you're looking for some sort of action movie this is not it.If you enjoy watching films where people talk about what they did whey they played AD&D; then you'll love it."
5,New Addition,"After losing another book on the Highwamen, I ordered this one which provided even more information about these talented gentlemen. I truly enjoy it."
5,The Real thing,"This is the real thing. This is the original Highwayman art book that first documented the journey of the highwaymen, who they were and how they got here. It is referenced by countless sources as the official list of the original 26 highwaymen. The first half of the book is mostly text with a few example prints interspersed and the second half is all plates of representative Highwaymen art. There now are several highwaymen art books, including 2 more by this author but this book serves as the bible for Highwaymen artist history."
4,Makes You Feel Like You're on Vacation,My husband and I spend many winters in the Caribbean and love this new twist on Christmas classics. Put some Jerk seasoning on your turkey this year and drop this in the CD player for a completely new tradition.
1,"Disappointing, save your money!","My grandchildren and I watched an original 1959 episode of ""Dennis the Menace"" while we waited for ""A Dennis the Menace Christmas"" to download to my TIVO from Amazon Instant Video. ( Amazon Instant Video is great!) This was an awful movie in every way. It was dull, shrill, repetitive and certainly not funny. The 1959 black and white episode was delightful by contrast. The writers of today should take a look at how stories and children's comedy was done in the past. Save your money!"
2,A Let Down,"I have been a fan of Robert Wagner and the various movies and shows he has been in; but this movie was a let down. It appeared to be produced in a choppy and sloppy fashion and did not live up to the standards of movies and shows that he has been a part of. I would not reccommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Robert Wagner, nor would I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of family Christmas movies. I gave it 2 stars as it was a family and Christmas movie and did star Robert Wagner and that can be considered a gift of the Holiday Season soon to be upon us."
1,disappointed,"This is the first time that I have ordered something from Amazon.com that was inferior. The DVD ""Dennis the Menace Christmas"" had stops in it all the way through the movie. It would stop and then start again. Very aggravating to watch, especially with younger children. I did not know where to turn to get another one. I would appreciate help with this. Thank you Donna Heselbarth"
2,Very slow movie for such a classic pair,"I have been a follower of Dennis the Menace for years, and thought that this sounded like a cute movie to watch. I did watch it completely, but half way I knew that I wouldn't be keeping this movie in the collection. Mr. Wilson has always been quite a character with Dennis, but in this movie he was just not what the character was meant to be.This movie is modern day(which is fine), but unfortunately the entire story was so slow that I turned it off several times. It kept jumping from one story to another. Also, Mrs. Wilson has always had a soft spot for Dennis, but in this movie she just didn't show any of this except to show what she wanted.If you have the chance to buy another movie, do so as even though this movie was quite inexpensive it was still too much for what it was."
2,Has Issues - can't use for multi-Media Storage/Streaming,"I'm happy with the NSLU2 other than the following issues which Linksys is not resolving.-- Unsuitable for Media Streaming. Every hour or so, the NSLU2 hangs for a minute. Definitely annoying while creating documents, etc - but completely unusable for streaming MP3s, JPEGs, MPEG Video, ripping audio CDs, etc. I have to periodically copy all of my media to my PCs local HD for streaming out to my media players.-- Only Supports SMB. Linux+Solaris clients must use SMB, ala Samba instead of standard NTFS. This prevents UNIX file system features such as symbolic links from being used. NTFS access was deliberately disabled from the embedded Linux running NSLU2."
2,Overall nice product but slow,"I bought this product to enable me to backup key personal data from the various computers in my house to a central location. Since I already had a USB 2.0 external hard drive I though this might alleviate the need to carry the drive between computers, which it does in some instances. It doesn't however in most instances.Because of the collisions and such on a wireless network, copying data to the drive via this device is really slow. It takes hours to copy over My Pictures or My Documents. That being said. If you are looking to use this device on your wireless network for backups, it is just too slow."
1,Doesn't Support Windows Format Drives!?!,"Beware: you can't just hook up an external hard drive to this thing and expect it to work.You have to format the drive first using the Linksys utility, which will erase all existing data on the drive and render the drive unreadable by Windows unless it is plugged into the NLSU2.That's right: if your drive already has data, you'll lose it during the format. Once formatted, the drive can't be attached directly to a PC anymore.None of this vital information appears on the box, which is very misleading. I've sent mail to Linksys on this issue and heard nothing back.Misleading marketing.Bad service.Dumb engineering decision to not allow a windows formatted drive.If you have a totally blank hard drive and you don't mind the fact that you'll never be able to use the drive directly on a PC without the linksys box, then go ahead. Otherwise, steer clear.One star."
1,"Piece of crap.,...stay away.","I have many Linksys devices and this is by far the worst one. I love Linksys stuff, which is why eveything that i own involving networking is linksis. But this thing is a piece of crap and now i cant recover the 60 gigs of personal pictures that were on my hardrive because of this things format. Spend a little more money and get a dedicated Network Attached Storage hard drive."
3,Simple to use and setup.. But slow,Sharing files was easy to setup and configure... however it does turn your Farrari USB 2.0 device into a 1.0 Yugo..It has its uses but they need to fix the access time...
4,"very useful, compact","this product has been very useful to me. It has a small footprint, is very very expandable, linux-based, very low-power and quiet. I use it for all of my movies, music. It's for anyone with a small home network, needing to share media."
1,Not worth it,"I find the storage link to be very unreliable. Everytime I tried to scan drives unit locked up and all my shares and data was lost. Needless to say I don't scan drives anymore. It seems to be ok if you leave the defaulet share and basically a wide open share Disk 1. Old adage you get what you pay for, I just wish I didn't pay for this at all."
1,Not simple as promised,"It is not compatible with windows at all. You will not be able to use the disk you are using with nsl pluged directly in a windows PC. Also, it is not compatible with windows vista."
4,Good Product,Does exactally what I wanted it to do. I turned it into an ftp server for an external hard drive. Easy to setup and configure.
3,"USB 2.0 NSLU2, works great with one drive","Product was easy to set up, for the first drive. After that the product would not recognize the second drive.Documentation did not address the symptom of not recognizing second drive. Numerous calls to customer service have not resolved the problem. For now, one drive is fine...Customer service (telephone) was particularly frustrating. Techs gave conflicting information...including the 'fact' that the unit would only operate one drive and one flash stick.Disappointing to wait all that time and then get a [...] for a tech."
2,Require format of attached disks,"I bought this in order to two two USB drives into network attached storage. The setup was relatively straight forward until I got to the end. Problem is that this device requires that you format any drives attached to it, and the drives I have are full of pictures, music, and movies. Thus, this seems an odd product to have on the market. If I just wanted empty NAS, I'd buy one...."
3,Check out the features,Do not purchase this access point if the following apply:1) You have external drives full of data you want to make available on your network. You must first reformat the drives to ext3 (a Linux format) which means you loose the data.2) You have PC's running Vista on your network. The only reliable means of uploading data in Vista is as an ftp client and that is achingly slow.3) You want to place frequently accessed files on the attached drives. Slooooow!Other than these caveats the unit works well. If you run XP or older OS you will probably love it. If you run Vista you'll probably loathe it. I cannot speak to Mac or Linux as I have not tried these systems.By the way customer support is excellent but this unit is not supported in Vista so you are on your own.
2,"Seems like a good deal, but it needs improvement","Finding it on your network is not a problem, as long as you make sure it is on the same subnet. It took awhile, but I figured this out as my router is of a different brand and used different defaults than this linksys device. The user interface is poor, not very intuitive, making it difficult to locate necessary settings. Everything is in it that you'll need, just hard to find. But the one thing I liked the least is you needed to format the USB hard drive specifically for this device, and without the device, Windows would not be able to read the data. The device absolutely would not work with the version of Norton Save & Restore I have. If for some reason you want a way of putting a USB thumb drive on the network - it does work well for this. 2 slots on the device, only one works with thumb drives - which it does not reformat, a good thing."
3,"BEWARE of ""features""","I was looking (and still am) for a simple way to connect an external USB hard drive to my network at home.I wanted to:1) be able to connect it to a NAS controller-like device and be able to backup files from any wireless device on the home network.Also (and this is the reason for my dissapointment)2) I wanted to be able to take my external hard drive with me whenever necessary.Well... the Linksys NSLU2 does 1, but will not allow 2 because it has to format the external drive to a format that is incompatible with Windows. Here is the quote from the online setup user guide: ""Note: Hard Disk Drives used on the Network Storage Link are NOT compatible with any version of Windows. You cannot swap USB HDDs between Windows and the Network Storage Link.""Would have been nice if this ""feature"" was better explained upfront, rather than me spending the $50 on the NSLU2 and ""chaining"" my external/potrable drive to it.Dissapointed. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know."
4,Awesome NAS DLNA server for my PS3,"Wow!!!! I just setup this little guy as a DLNA server for my PS3 and it streams music, video, and pictures. It can also stream nearly anything I can attach to it. I'm using Mediatomb with this little device and it ROCKS!!!!!. It's a lot of work as in research....but it's soooo worth it. With my awesome stand-alone drives hooked up and more to hook up...I'm saving quite a bit of money here. I highly recommend the NSLU2. Very smooth even with HD files at 1920x1080."
5,Great Network Storage Server,"Before this device, I was backing up my computer systems via a USB port on my master computer. My network consists of both wired and WiFi with emphasis on the WiFi. The time it took to complete back-ups of my data took too long. The ease of hooking of this network storage server took only minutes and it formatting of the external hard drives was quick and easy. My network easily established communications with the device. Once Installed, I did a complete back-up from a remote computer using the WiFi, what would have taken six hours was knocked down to about two hours! I've had zero problems with it. I'm extremely glad that I got it."
1,Pure Trash!,"I agree with the other one star reviewer, accept my through put has reached between 2-10Mbits. Don't waist the time on this device."
2,Nice design but function poor,Transfer file slow and with large file connection dropNice design but function poorFor large Hard Drive max format 80gb on web base toolOnly large format can be done in DOS/FAT16 format 160gb and more
1,very disappointed,"I had hoped to use the NSLU with a couple large NTFS drives to provide backup and iTunes repository for all my home computers. No such luck.First, performance was dismal: about 1.5 MB/sec, far slower than my network drives. Second, the NSLU would hang once or twice a day; only a power-off reset would restore it. Third, the internal utility web page could not be accessed, and without it several important parameters (eg workgroup name) could not be set. On the plus side, initial setup was easy."
4,"Works great, but setup is a little screwy.","I have this device serve two external USB drives (250 and 500 Gigs) over my wireless network and it works very well. It strangely lost one of the drives for no reason on one occasion, but found it again on it's own. Otherwise there have been no problems with this device.While this device does offer security features by username and password, those features are only available with an EXT2 formatted drive attached. Since my drives are FAT and NTFS, I cannot set up separate accounts.I did have an inital problem connecting my NTFS drive to the NSLU2 which required me to call customer service. My Indian representative repeatedly told me that the NSLU2 does not support NTFS even though the outside of the box proudly proclaims that it does. We eventually got it to work through a series of reboots of both the drives and the NSLU2."
4,Good Product - Klunky User Interface,"I'm using the NSLU2 as a home backup server for 3 PCs. I have two USB drives connected to the NSLU2. Disk 1 for daily backups. Disk 2 for weekly backups of Disk 1. Works as advertised, but the user interface is anti-intuitive and painful to use. I don't use any of the fancy features (email alerts, shares, auto-backup of Disk 1 to Disk 2, user permissions) because I don't need them. I'm automatically backing up 3 NTFS PCs with Norton Ghost 9.0 with no problems. I highly recommend reading the whole manual before setting up. The only reason this server didn't get five stars is the crude user interface."
4,"Good product, but do you need it","The product worked well, though configuration took some work. If you want to see how much this device can do, be sure to check out the exhaustive articles on Tom's Hardware's Networking page.I decided to return this product and instead built a cheap computer to house a bunch of internal hard drives. Unlike external hard drives, the computer is upgradeable and can network on its own. I also used a Shuttle case, so I didn't sacrifice much portability."
1,Horrible Product,"I bought this product thinking ""An All In One Sharing Capible Drive"" NOT the case!! How do they expect to sell any of these with a propriatary file system?!?! the access on the drive is SLOW. Thier Tech Support is worthless (took me 30 minutes to talk to an ACTUAL PERSON) and they still couldnt resolve the issue i was having after a hour long phone conversation. I know have a very heavy papper wieght. THANKS LINKSYS!"
1,Don't expect this to be easy,"I bought this product after purchasing the Maxtor One-touch because I was enticed by the prospect of being able to schedule simple, scheduled backups of the 3 computers that I have on my home network. Forget it! The simplicity of the Maxtor product goes down the drain when you buy the Linksys NSU. I am much more technically inclined then the vast majority of business or home computer users, and I've been on and off HOLD for over an hour with Linksys tech support. They can't even figure out why I can't connect to the Maxtor from my laptop. I'm ready to ship the product back and try to reformat the Maxtor to work with just one PC, as it was originally designed with it's easy-to-use backup software. If you decide to buy this, make sure you are much more techically savy than Linksys' tech support people because they won't help you at all. VERY DISAPPOINTING AFTER LOTS OF WASTED TIME!"
1,Extremely unreliable! very difficult accessing files!,Extremely unreliable! Very difficult accessing files! Not worth the trouble!
5,Much simpler to use that it looked,"When I first took this out of the box, I had this feeling that it would take me forever to get it to work. But I followed the very simple instructions and it worked perfectly first time. It has become very helpful in accessing archived photos and other files on the wireless network."
1,get ready for disappointment if you are hooking this up to an Apple computer,"I have been on the phone with Linksy, then Apple, and then Linksys again for 1 1/2 hours to no avail. This product is not made to work smoothly with Apple computers and I would urge you not to buy it. It is not worth the trouble. Linksys customer support is polite, but they have a policy of not offering troubleshooting for apple computers, which I think is ridiculous."
2,"Forget NTFS, FAT32","If you are going to use this device the way it was originally designed, i.e. using EXT3 formatted hard drives you may be satisfied. If you are buying this to share NTFS or FAT32 formatted drives for plug and play compatibility with Windows DO NOT buy this device, it will only bring you heartbreak and misery.When using NTFS formatted drives you will constantly lose the network connection forcing you to re-boot the device and start all over again. Also, the second port will not support NTFS formatted drives although it will support FAT32 but only up to 80 Mbytes.So, for about 80 bucks, if you stick with EXT3 and your network bandwidth is pretty good (100 mbytes, hardwired), you may have some success."
3,be careful,At least on a Mac you have to reformat your hard drive and then you can ONLY use it as a network drive and not on a single mac anymore. For me it turned out to be more easy to use one of my Mac's and share its hard drives.
4,"good, cheap solution","This is a good product. It's small, silent and cheaper thana Network Attached Storage (NAS) solution if you have USB hard disks lying around. Setup is a breeze and the latest firmware allows it to be used with FAT32 and NTFS disks.You just won't get user and group security with those filesystems.The web UI is horrid and not very intuitive for inexperienced users. You'll have to do some experimenting to get it set up properly. I recommend mapping out the shares, along with corresponding user and group permissions first.I give it 4 stars for the unintuitive web interface and shoddy manual. I also give it the same 4 stars for being easier to setup than the equivalent Linux fileserver with Samba.The unit is very versatile and can be modded with various 3rd-party firmware to do things like be a print server, web server, secure shell, etc.I'm getting another one to use as a web, print and secure shell server."
4,Only One Gripe,"This is actually a pretty nice unit. My only gripe is that if you have a power outage, someone needs to manually push the on/off button to turn it back on. Not very well though out on the part of Linksys. Otherwise, it provides far more functionality than it claims including acting beautifully as a webserver."
5,Cisco's Slug,"I bought this as a low power server to run my weather station - and it's great. It comes at the right price, and once you install a more generic operating system you can use it for pretty much anything. I'm using it as a disk-server, web site, and weather station monitor. Now my only problem is thinking of reasons to buy more!The only downside - it doesn't automatically power back on after an outage."
5,Neat-o,"This product is full a capabilities to do more with 3rd party firmware.The only caveat is that although this is a great product to use for external drives, it is not intended for NTFS formatted drives, so you must FIRST format to Ext3 (let the device do this).Otherwise, it works great"
2,Not Ready for use with an NTFS drive,"The new firmware claims to support only one NTFS formatted drive; but it doesn't work very well. I tried for several days to back up data files. The jobs would start and never finish. No error messages in the log. No clue. Very often the system would totally hang and not be addressable from the web interface. This required unplugging the power to reset the box -- the reset button was useless in these cases. After many days of frustration, I tried reformatting the drive to the native Linux ext3. It's worked automatically without a problem since. The issue here is if the device fails, the drive is unreadable from a Windows machine. So my recommendation is if you are strictly a windows operation, look elsewhere. On the other hand if you have a mixed environment this could be a very cost effective NAS system for you."
3,Functional But A Little Slow,"I purchased the Network Attached Storage (NAS) device with the idea of being able to store a large collection of music CDs which I have converted to MP3s as well as a number of DVDs. While this is possible, it takes a very long time to transfer large files to it. I have it attached to 100MB/s network. Transferring a 4 gigabyte file from the drive on machine A to a drive on machine B is, by my estimate, 5 to 10 times faster than transferring the same file from machine A to the NAS device.What is difficult to understand is that similar results are obtained when you compare the transfer of a file across the same network to an USB 2.0 external drive attached to machine B. I realize that data transfer is limited to the 100 megabit per second speed of the network less overhead. I don't think that data transfer to the NAS device even gets close.Other than speed the device functions reliably and was easy to install. It is useful for backup of smaller data files."
2,Not Ready for Prime Time,"In contrast to some of Linksys' other products, this one is surprisingly unpolished, with buggy firmware, failure to recognize and format various types of flash drives, slow performance, Windows-unfriendly formatting, network mapping and password hassles, and willing, but clueless Technical Support. Instead, get the far speedier Netdisk from Ximeta, a generally superior performer."
3,While it does work quite well there are limitations,"As it has been mentioned several times in previous reviews, The Linksys NSLU2 is not directly compatiable with the Windows OS. You can not just plug and play on any windows computer.If you are running a personal firewall program such as Norton Internet Security, you will encounter some problems unless you disable it when you wish to access the drive or make some modifications to the firewall.Other limitations include the lack of support of firewire and ability to daisy chain several drives together.With those limitations out of the way. It is a perfect a way to share files (sucha s MP3's, Photo's, ZIP files, etc..) with several computers in your workgroup."
2,"Slow, slow slow zzzzzzzzzz","As others have reported, this gizmo is easy to set up and configure out of the box. However, I am seeing throughput speeds on the order of 150 Kbps (average). That is not a misprint, I typed a ""K"" in front of the speed. It takes absurdly long to open a single digital photo and/or copy a single mp3. It could take days to fill the device with data -- not that I've had the patience to let it run that long.Other than the NSLU2, my network hums along reliably and at high speed. Very disappointing...so far I have spent more than ten hours installing, debugging, testing and trolling internet sites looking for a solution. I don't have limitless time to debug the NSLU2, especially since I originally bought it as a covenience to SAVE me time. I'll probably noodle around a little bit more and if/when I make no headway then sell it online for whatever I can get.Not recommended, even for hobbyists. If you must buy it, ensure that you have a good return policy to fall back on."
2,False Advertising,"Well, I just received my LinkSys Network Storage Link. Just a wee bitof false advertising. All of the advertising and all over the outsideof the box it brags about being able to hook up two USB drives.Supports Windows file systems FAT 32 and NTFS. Built in utilities -format, backup and scandisk.BUT - just a small thing, of course. Reading the INSIDE Directions:<quote> If your USB drive is formatted as FAT32 or NTFS, the you willnot be able to use the Users, Groups, or Backup features of the NetworkStorage Link. These features will only work with with EXT3-formatteddrives. *NOTE*: The Disk 1 port of the Network Storage Link supportsEXT3, FAT32, and NTFS file systems, while the Disk 2 port only supportsEXT3 and FAT32 file systems.</quote>I'm not a happy camper. I have been grossly misled on the capabilitiesof this product."
1,anything but the NSLU2,"I donot reccomend this product for those who really need NAS storage. After 6 hrs of tech support and their lack of knowledge, the first product was deemed defective, which I knew when it was initially installed and wouldn't set itself up. A new unit and another 3 hrs of non tech tech support it was deemed that this product is not reccomended for a domained network as it will not work in a domain, only a workgroup.If you can get this product non defective out of the box for a 2 or 3 workgroup computer network then go for it. Other than that use the Linksys EFG series, (EFG 80,120 or 250), for real NAS storage and backups.This was a good idea but functionality is somewhat shy of FUBAR'ed."
3,Minute Detail,This covers most allied armor in minute detail. You will see footage of all of the different models with brief descriptions of their speed armament armor etc in a cronological order.What is realy missing is a comparasion of the allied armor with that of the axis and how they fared in battle their strengths and weakness overall it is ok if you are a real history buff.
3,Too snug a fit for the LG VX9400,"The design and quality of the product is very good, and for the price I couldn't resist. The only problem is that the leather case is just a tad too narrow for the VX9400 to slip easily and quickly in and out.I used a razor blade to slash the elastic side panels open ( too bad, they look like they'd work well if made the right size ). I also jammmed in some napkins and other objects to stretch the leather out to a better size. It works pretty well, now, and for the money, I'm happy.The package itself lists several other phones, none of which are even LG phones. It appears someone figured this case was ""close enough"" for the VX9400. Not quite, but it can be made to work adequately."

3,Great Vendor,"The book is okay, but I really like this vendor. Have ordered several books, used, and they always look great and are shipped quickly."
3,A good dramatization of an excellent book,"Most of the time, when I hear the words, ""Based on the book by..."" I cringe and turn the channel. Not so with 'The Cater Street Hangman'. While not entirely true to the Anne Perry book, it contained most of the major details and was suspenseful enought to make the ending rather shocking. The casting was good (although I must admit that I always pictured Thomas Pitt as being a polite but rather unremarkable-looking man - which he wasn't in the movie!). Charlotte was wonderful. I would very much like to see other Anne Perry books dramatised in a similar fashion - perhaps the William Monk series? The only reason I gave it three stars rather than four was because the limited budget was painfully apparent on occasion - for example, Charlotte's final encounter with the murderer. That, at least, could have been filmed better. But all-in-all, certainly worth a look."
5,A Wonderful Teleplay of Anne Perry's Novel.,"I loved this production of Anne Perry's ""Cater Street Hangman"", the first Charlotte and Thomas Pitt mystery. Keeley Hawes and Eoin McCarthy are perfectly cast as Charlotte Ellison and Thomas Pitt. I agree with previous posters that they softened the mystery by changing the solution, but I think I appreciate it less for the mystery, and more for the story of Charlotte and Thomas. It's too bad this isn't available on it's own anymore. It's still available as part the British Victorian Collection, but as I really don't want the other three movies that come with it, I'm glad I was able to get ""the Cater Street Hangman"" on it's own. I started reading the books because of this production, and still imagine Charlotte and Thomas as they were in the movie."
1,"Really, this is very poorly done","If you don't care about what the actual poster looks like, bam, this one is for you. If you want the drawings to be at all accurate, don't get this one.The Thresher Shark is wildly off. The Leopard is the wrong colors. The Nurse shark's tail is wrong. The Goblin Shark is just horribly, horribly wrong.There is very little about this that is done accurately. It reminds me of that botched restoration of the painting of Jesus in Spain.Really, it is just bad. I got this for my little girl, who loves sharks, and this falls way, way short of the mark."
1,Very unreliable,"I have had an unfortunate 20% failure rate burning with these HP-branded discs, consistent on two different drive/computer configs. No other brand +R or -R has ever given me such trouble. Having had enough with the failures, I switched to a new pack of Memorex -Rs and all returned to normal. I have also previously noted my satisfaction with Verbatim 95098 +Rs (bought here from Amazon).Avoid this product, as you have a wealth of other options and brands to choose from."
1,Not very reliable,"I had to go through five disks in order to write two recovery disks for my PC. At this rate, I might get 20 good disks out of the 50."
1,You can do so much better,"I'm fully disatisfied. I thought sigg was a good brand to go with, but I thought wrong. The mouth is way too small to begin with. I bought this thing to get away from plastic, but the cap is polypropelene, ok not bad, but could do better. I also just noticed that the design is a bunch of white people. What's up with that? It came entirely over packaged. I mean, do you really need bubble wrap AND paper to protect this thing in a box? If you want a much better product, I already found one. It's made by Together Bottle. Wide mouth, steel cap! AND less packaging, and bottom line is I bought 2 27 oz bottles and a 40 oz for the same price as this one. Think GREEN"
3,Older bottle lining,"I wish I knew this had the older Sigg bottle lining, which contains traces of BPA. It's too late to return it now but I have learned my lesson and will be purchasing my next bottle from the store."
1,Ecocare liner peels off!!!,"While I didn't buy this particular SIGG bottle on Amazon (found it cheaper elsewhere) and can't speak for the BPA-full liner as mine doesn't have it, the new Ecocare liner isn't any better. It started peeling off after the first use and I have not used it since then, which was a year ago. Given their track-record of lies, I wouldn't risk their claim that peeling of the liner isn't harmful if ingested.Strangely enough, I have other SIGG bottles that do not peel off and don't seem to have the BPA liner. Not sure what this means but it makes me very wary of their business practices and reluctant to trust them anymore."
1,THESE ARE THE OLD SIGG BOTTLES WITH THE BPA LINING,"DO NOT BUY! These are the old Sigg bottles with the BPA lining! Sigg no longer manufactures bottles with this lining and they are no longer sold in stores, and for good reason. I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday and as soon as he opened the bottle we both realized it had to go back. It's a shame since Sigg makes great quality water bottles."
4,"Right size, and pretty, but I still miss my Nalgene","After all the news about BPA in Nalgene bottles, I decided to switch to a SIGG. It's very pretty, and it's a good size. The smaller mouth keeps it from spilling and makes it easier to drink from in the car, or on the go. My only two issues are that the metal is really cold when you first fill it with water, and it doesn't seem to hold temperature as well as the Nalgene did. The other issue is that I'm a little concerned about cleaning it properly. I wash it every few days, and let it dry out with the lid off.....but I'm a bit apprehensive that I can't get in there and wipe it out really well...."
1,Awful company,"These guys lined their bottles with BPA and after being caught doing so they claimed the bottle just ""didnt leech BPA"". What a croc! Do a google search and you'll turn up a bunch of info on this."
2,Not very sturdy,"I bought a 1 L waterbottle and within 3 days dropped it on a carpeted floor, and it got a huge dent. It's since gotten another dent. I don't care about aesthetics, but I am afraid that the enamel will eventually come off (or the volume will be much less than 1 L because of all the dents into the bottle). I was very disappointed, since this is such an expensive waterbottle. On the other hand - it doesn't have any ""taste"" at all, and it seems to have a good seal - it doesn't leak like Nalgene does. If only I could be sure it's going to LAST more than a few weeks... I'm a bit afraid to take it out on the trail, which is what it's made for, right?"
4,Great Product!,"This bottle is perfect for me for drinking water. I keep it @ my desk all day, take it with me in the car, & toss it in my backpack when I go hiking or snowshoeing. It does not leak & the ""metal"" taste goes away w/in 1 - 2 uses/washings. I didn't give it 5 stars because it was a little pricey up front but it sure beats the plastic bottles!"
5,Great Fashion Statement,"I bought every member of my family a Sigg bottle for Christmas and we are now able to give up our addiction to toxic, wasteful, and expensive plastic water bottles. I love not having to shop for water at the grocery store and lug those cases of water home, not to mention storing them somewhere. Now everyone has thier own Sigg bottle that represents their style and we fill them up each night with a Pur water filter-doesn't get any better or easier. My only worry is that one of my kids will leave it at school and someone will ""walk off with it"" because they are so cool, but so far that has not been a problem."
1,Sigg lies,"I bought a Sigg twice and it turned out both were filled with lies and BPA. They offered me free shipping for a new bottle. Now that's service. Don't do business with this company, who knows what is in that liner now. Don't take the risk. There have been Sigg users develop neurological disorders after years of use."
4,Two caveats,"Love my bottle, use it all the time; it is a really beautiful object. Bought the kids some too, don't know if that wil have turned out to be a good idea, still better than them drinking out of plastic.Two caveats:1) Not dishwasher safe and Hard to figure out how to clean (I just purchased Sigg's specially designed brush--hope it helps)2) Not terribly scratch and dent-proof."
1,"Not for outdoors, but good looking...","When I got this waterbottle I was a little disappointed. The bottle is sharp looking, but is made out of very thin steel. I can easily squeeze and bend the middle of the waterbottle. Just the other day i dropped it in the kitchen, and not to my suprise a huge dent was in the top. Now I am very active person, so what if I would have dropped this when I was out hiking or climbing? This is a good waterbottle for the office, not the outdoors."
1,Poor customer service. Misleading practices.,"Count me in as another disgruntled customer who will never purchase a Sigg bottle. Mine was bought with the old BPA lining, which is scratched and peeling. The bottle also dented easily and was hard to clean. I've sent it back to Sigg under their replacement program but have yet to hear back from them (their website buries the replacement program). I found Sigg's CEO to be misleading, if not unethical.I've since moved on to Kleen Kanteen."
1,Sigg bottles may contain BPA,"Did you buy the Sigg water bottle to avoid BPA? Yup, so did I. So I am distressed to learn that until August of 2008, Sigg bottles had a plastic liner that, incredibly, contained traces of BPA. The company is only now revealing this information. For shame. For more info, Google this topic. Here's a sample article: http://www.canada.com/health/found+supposedly+safe+Swiss+water+bottles/1928825/story.html"
1,Epoxy inner layer peels off,I spent over $60 on 3 water bottles. I was expecting superior quality for this price but the bottles were easily dented. The real problem is not with the dents but the epoxy that is coating the inside of the bottle is peeling off. It is really disguising. I hand wash all of my bottles so this is very disappointing. The company does not stand behind their product. They will not give refunds for anything over 30 days old. Stay away from this company and their products. For this price their products should be guaranteed. I will never purchase a sigg product again.
1,Bad Product,"I bought Sigg bottles because they said they were eco-friendly and safe to drink from. Then they admitted to having BPA in the liner - so I traded mine in and gave them another chance, I even bought one more. Now six months with my new bottles and the liner is literally peeling off and I'm spitting out the bits! When I was washing, the entire lining around the screw cap came off and exposed the aluminum. It's over, I will not use or buy this product again."
1,leaks water,"I had an old Sigg bottle for years that worked perfectly, but a few months ago I lost it and had to replace it. Naturally I wanted another Sigg bottle. Unfortunately they now have this new BPA free lining (which I would love if it worked), but within months the lining started coming off of around the inside of the mouth. Now the cap doesn't stay on tight, and if the bottle is on its side it will leak water out. It makes me really frustrated, there's really only one thing a water bottle needs to do and that's hold liquid - which my fairly expensive sigg bottle now fails to do after merely months of use. I'm not sure what I'm going to buy to replace it with, but I know it won't be one of the new Sigg bottles."
5,I love Sigg bottles,Sigg bottles are great - they aren't too heavy and keep your water cold. The best part is no nasty chemicals leach into your water!
5,Excellent for Daily Work,"I bring my 1 Liter bottle to work daily. Convenient, light, and my coworkers love the colors! I also bought different colors for my bridesmaids as part of their gift and it was a huge success."
2,Do NOT buy these Sigg bottles,"I compared them with Klean Kanteen and went with Sigg. Why? Honestly, because they were just so much more appealing to look at than Klean. I regret it. I've read they do not include BPA anymore, but that doesn't remove the fact that once this liner peels off, as it did with mine in 2 days, you have aluminum to worry about. Read about the diseases associated with aluminum ingestion. This is my second bottle in 2 weeks as my initial order's bottle had a weird plastic taste to it and already the liner is peeling at the opening. Returning both and going with who I should have went with first, Klean Kanteen. I just wish they didn't manufacture in China."
2,beware of old lining,I had to send the bottle back to Sigg due to the old copper looking liner that has BPA You can check on the testing at Sigg/exchange website This happens 2 years ago yet the bottles are still on the market I purchased mine a month ago from AmazonThe new econliner also comes off in their first batch of production but SIgg claims that the liner is food quality grade and is not harmful At least SIgg is responsible for its product The exchange is only until 10/31/09
1,Don't buy to be green,"Sigg bottles had quite the jump in sales when everyone started avoiding plastic and specifically Nalgene due to BPAs (a chemical) that were in the plastic. They did this while quietly lining their bottles with BPA plastic. This was announced when they came out with new ones, and there is (was) an exchange program. Now I went to their site and found that they sell PVC stickers to go on the outside of your bottles for decoration purposes. While you do not drink out of this sticker, PVC and the inks that are typically used to print on PVC outgas nasty chemicals (VOCs) and are not at all recyclable (they are laminated with adhesive). This is NOT something that an environmentally concerned company would do. Perhaps Kleen canteen is better - at least they are stainless.Do what you will with this information."
5,Love my new waterbottle!!,I love this type of waterbottle! It is incredibly sturdy and handy to have around! I had another one like this but with a different design and I dropped it many times on the ground but it never cracked or broke.
3,"Dents easily, not great for outdoor use","I've had this bottle for about 9 months, and used it primarily at the office with no complaints. Then I took it on a weekend sea-kayaking trip and strapped it to the top of the kayak. I was shocked to see that the elastic kayak straps caused 2 big dents, and part of the bottom appears to be falling apart as well. It's definitely more fragile than I expected for something marketed as an outdoor product."
1,Unhappy with SIGG,"As others have stated, I am very angry and disappointed that I bought 3 SIGG bottles only to learn they can leak BPA. I bought the bottles because they were highly touted as SAFE. I downloaded a return label from SIGG and returned my bottles for replacement (we have to pay the shipping costs) and have yet to hear a word from them after a month. They were supposed to e-mail me a certificate to buy replacements. Now I'm out $60 for the bottles and $8 for shipping.Now I hear they never stopped shipping the old bottles and some customers have recently bought ones with the old liner. I will NEVER buy another SIGG product and will strongly advise others to stay away. A bad product, deceitful company and lousy customer service. Three good reasons to go elsewhere."
1,the lining peeled!,"i ordered two of these bottles from amazon and and within a month, i noticed the lining on the neck of the bottle started peeling. so i contacted zigg and sent them back for a replacement. it's been a month, and i haven't gotten my replacement. i would recommend the camelbak bottles instead. you don't have to worry about a liner."
2,Nice looking. VERY fragile.,"This is a beautiful bottle. The mouth of it fits my mouth great. However, it's so fragile. You've read the reviews of people frustrated by how easily this dents if you drop it. I don't care if I have some dents. But, I had my hands full the other day, and I dropped my water bottle on the sidewalk from waist level. The drop pierced the bottle, and now it leaks. It's garbage now. A $25 water bottle should stand up to more than that."
1,Feel misled by a bottle containing a toxic liner,"Bought this to have a water bottle without having to worry about BPA. After about a year of use it turns out the liners (which they still hide the composition of) actually contain BPA. I emailed them and received a very condescending letter. Some folks have sent their bottles in for replacements, but it looks like they're having trouble getting SIGG to honor their end of the deal (read on [...])I recommend glass Aquasana bottles. You can get six of them with a travel pouch to make them easier to carry/prevent breakage for not much more than this."
4,Good Option for carrying water,No chemicals leaching into your water. This is a solid bottle! My only complaint is that I have been unable to find great bottle top options. I was unhappy with the Bottle Top Accessory by Sigg.
4,Don't buy this here!,"You can get this bottle for $24.95 at Whole Foods, so why pay almost twice as much?I have wanted a Sigg bottle for a long time and was happy to find it at Whole Foods. It's a good product and would have given it 5 stars, but the opening at the top is hard to fit ice in and it doesn't come with a sport lid for easy access. Having to unscrew the top every time is a pain. But I will probably pay the extra and buy the top separately."
4,Love it,I love this bottle - cute and environmentally friendly. The only minus is this size will not fit in a standard cup holder and it doesn't keep stuff cold as long as it states.
5,Stop buying bottled water.,"Drinking bottled water is a waste of money and puts extreme strains on the enviornment. Your city's tap water is just as safe, if not safer as it is subject to harsher testing and regulations. This Sigg waterbottle will pay for itself in a few weeks if you were like me, and spending a dollar a day on bottled water."
2,delivery issues,"bottle is good, looks good, functions as promised.seller is unreliable, I paid extra so it would arrive in time for a present, it came late and they charged me extra for fast shipping and I was never able to get any refund, return call or email."
2,Weak steel.....,The Sigg dropped off the kitchen counter and is really one of a kind...A big sigg with a dent bigger than the one on my fender.I got caught up in the Sigg hype...but this little personal item is still cheaper and cooler than an IPod...
3,Needs better quality control!,These are beautiful coasters. However the cork backing fell off of each one as soon as they were used! Easily glued back on but at the cost of these coasters this was unacceptable. This is why I only gave this product 3 stars.
4,"Not squirrel proof, but built to last","I've been using one of these for...maybe 25 years or so? We got it as a Christmas gift back in the '80's.It takes a beating and we keep it filled 365 days a year. It's difficult for a squirrel to walk down the chain and on to the feeder, but squirrels can and do get on it and have to be occasionally chased away. They can jump from a branch or another feeder on to the rim that holds the seed. Sometimes we have a squirrel feeding on one side, with birds on the other!The big center round seed cylinder finally broke the other day, split from top to bottom. I'm going to try glue and duct tape to keep it going. Any bird feeder than can last more than a couple of decades is pretty amazing when you think about it...and we haven't taken any special care of it during all that time. Just keep it filled and watch the birds."
2,Don't make this your sole source,"This book was of great help as we set up an itinerary for a self-tour of inland Scotland, but don't make the mistake of using it as your sole or even main source of information. It fails to make even a mention of several sites of major interest. We almost bypassed two of our favorite castles on the trip, thinking that if they weren't in Fodor's, they were probably piles of rubble of no historical interest. Also, treatment of B&Bs (our mainstay when traveling) was scant; don't use them as your main source of lodging info.I guess you could say the above of almost any travel guide, but this trip made us especially aware of the drawbacks of depending on a single source."
4,maximum boy attack of the under water people,Maximum Boy starring in attack of the underwater peopleReviewed by Jaclyn. L. (Age 8)It&#65533;s a great book by Dan Greenburg. The illustrations are by Greg Swearingen . This book is about a boy named Max and when ever the president calls him; he and his sister will become Maximum Boy & girl. So 1 day the president called Maximum Boy & girl because he said there is waterpeople on Coney Island. So Maximum boy & girl flew to Coney Island. And they talked about a WAR. Whose team is going to win? Water peoples or people who live on earth? I think the big message is even though you&#65533;re small it doesn&#65533;t mean you can&#65533;t be smarter and tougher than other people can&#65533;t. I like this book because it&#65533;s funny!I recommend this book to people who like funny super hero chapter books ...
5,More then a Cook Book!,"Lobster Rolls and Blueberry Pie is more then just a cookbook, but a wonderfully blended compilation of stories and recipes from Rebecca Charles childhood in Maine. The stories give context to the food that is described here and motivates one to experiment with this type of cuisine. I have never spent a summer in Maine, but after creating a few meals with the book and sharing some of the related stories with gathered guests, I feel like I have insight into this historic American culture. A must have for any cook or foodie!"
3,Misleading,"This is not a terrible cookbook, but I ended up returning it because it was not what I was looking for. I bought this book because it had a high rating, and regret not reading more about the subject matter before purchasing. Here's an idea: learn Maine cooking from a chef who is actually from Maine. There is a huge difference between the natives who can create amazing food using the few local ingredients that we can harvest year round, and the tourists who gorge on lobster 2 months out of the year. Anyone can make blueberry crisp, and a lobster roll is about as simple a recipe as they come, but if I want to learn REAL Maine cuisine, I'll look elsewhere."
4,AHHHHHHH!,"If you have oodles of time and money, enjoy a spa vacation. If you wish to develop grooming habits, relaxation techniques and radient well beeing to last a lifetime, start now with this book. It is a great DO IT YOURSELF kit that reaps a lifetime of benefit by creating well being habits. I gave it 4 stars because it's a 10 year old book. My spa research has turned up only 10 year old books. I have not checked books in print to find newer ones...takes too much time. I'd rather be giving myself a luxurious spa treatment from this book. Try it. You will be far ahead of the crowd. This book covers all aspects of home spa treatments in an easy to use and understand foremat. I love it."
1,Crap,"It cracked when I was attaching one of the screws. Then I found another at Menards for a fraction of the price. It's definately a wall plate, but an expensive one."
2,4 out of 8 screws ain't bad.,"The product was fine but the handling left a bit to be desired. The factory cellophane envelope was torn and the shipping box was not tightly sealed. 4 of the eight screws were missing, 2 of the screws were found floating around inside the shipping box and somehow never found there way to one of many holes. Packing was minimal which contributed to the losses. I commented on here about the poor packing but have not heard any reply. If anybody is listening, I need 4 more of the special 'Black' mounting screws that are part of this item."
4,Significant Improvement in Syptoms,After using this product for a short time we saw significant improvement in our cat's worst symptoms of Feline Herpes. He no longer has to live with a continually stuffy nose and I am no longer cleaning his eyes four or five times a day. The best part is that it is easy to dispense and he takes it like it is a treat.
2,psychological tricks cannot replace a saving relationship with Jesus Christ,"This book is an analysis of cult mind control from a psychological point of view.It is quite interesting to read, especially the explanation of what mind control is and how it works, and it takes the problem of belonging to a cult very seriously.Unfortunately, Hassan fails to realize that the only way to save someone from a cult is introducing him/her to the real Jesus. Only Jesus can free the cultist from the bondage of a false religion. Trying to make somebody exit a cult with psychological tricks will leave the person in a spiritual void that will likely culminate in entering another cult or becoming disillusioned with religion altogether."
1,Negative book!!! What happened to Tolerence?,"I wouldn't hold stalk on anything book suggesting that A.A. is a cult.But i mean really, what about tolerence? Whats with the fear spreading? Can't we all just get along?"
5,Very enlightening,"As a former member of a destructive cult, reading this book was therapeutic for me, giving insight into the psychological factors that induce people into destructive cults in the first place. The author defines ""cults"" not by examining unorthodox doctrines of groups, but by observing the amount of control the group exerts over the lives of it's followers. If you have family or friends in cults, this book tells the way to go about dealing with the problem, and also how to protect yourself from being recruited into a cult. A must-read for anyone affected by the cult problem"
5,Scott's review of Combatting Mind Control,I found the book very informative and easy to understand. I was able to relate to what Steve was talking about having been raised in a mind control cult myself. I would recommend the book to those who are working on helping someone escape this subtle nightmare to become alive again. I am persuing the same mission field as Steve and he inspired me to stay with it.
5,This book helped me,"When I learned that L. Ron Hubbard had officially ""erased"" his 2nd wife, Sara, and began describing her as the Russian communist spy Sara Komkosadamanov, and then I saw the huge stack of abandoned dianetics books at a used book store, I knew something was seriously wrong. Since then I've been reading and reading. Now I've just finished a really nice and concise over-view of whole messy subject: 'Combatting Cult Mind Control' by Steven Hassan. If you're tempted to wander into the world of cults, read this book first."
4,Good basic information,"A good book to start if a relative or a friend joins a cult. The book not only explains the mechanisms used by these groups, but it also tells good questions to ask as a ""spiritual consumer""."
2,The Fox Was in the Henhouse,"The present Baha'i administration covers itself with elaborate ornamentations that not only mask its deeply cult nature but help it appear to blend in with current liberal trends. I have no doubt that the word went out across the U.S. to its Baha'i communities to jump in here and give glowing reviews of this book whether or not they had read it. The author was given access to a parade of high-level Baha'is who are on the fast track (which runs over the little people)to get to more powerful Baha'i positions. I have not yet met a single Baha'i of lower rank who could, or would, speak for himself, and I spent 30 years under the regime. I have met many who would run over their own grandmothers if it would get them closer to a job on MtCarmel, the present world center."
5,A great tasting treat,"I didn't really expect anything different when I broke open my package of Mariani apricots - I mean, dried apricots are dried apricots, right? Well, I must say that I right noticed that these apricots were better than the ones I normally buy. Mainly, where most dried apricots I have gotten have been a little to tough and chewy, these ones are more tender. I found them to be a great tasting treat, and am very glad that I got them!"
1,stop smoking,"this product does not work. another product that looked similar in packaging,""smokeaway"", was more successful for me for as much as 5 years."
3,"It's ok, doesn't curve the cravings, as much as it should.","i purchaced it a few weeks ago for a friend who wants to outright quit smoking, and she's still smoking, it doesn't curve the cravings like it should, sadly.. but as a positive, she is smoking less..."
2,Not for me,It may work for some but not me. I will spend the extra money next time and buy a product that worked for me in the past.
4,An entertaining assortment of games for all ages,"The eleven games included were described in a previous review and many have different difficulty levels. With the money you've earned by playing any game of your choice, you can buy 4 additional islands and decorations for them. The monkey and crab are quite entertaining as they interact with each other and the objects you have purchased. Purchasing flowers will attract butterflies, etc. After you've decorated an island sufficiently you will unlock another game to play. In some games, try right clicking for more playability. It's a nice relaxing game that's sure to put a smile on your face and most likely make you laugh."
4,Great Game,We really enjoy this game. It's especially great for 5-9 year-olds. We're VERY happy with this purchase.
5,"Loves ""quick"" games, but....","I bought this game as I like to have games where I can play for 1/2 hour or so at a time and get back into them easily. But....I found myself playing for hours so I could accumulate enough points to buy lots of goodies and move to the new islands. There is a good mxi of mini-games to play and the difficulties increase the more times you play. It's clever that you can click on the items you ""bought"" and the monkey will go use them. You will get plenty of play time for your money. Can hardly wait for Tropix 2 to be available on Amazon."
4,Roseanne keeps getting funnier..The first Halloween episode,"The second season of Roseanne is not as great as season one but it's still a great season and is one of the funniest shows on tv ever. Let me start withe the bad stufff of the season id di not like the dream episode, the income tax episode, the father and daughter epidose,and the first episode with Tom Arnold. The good stuff is the show started to deal with more real issue's like teen drinking,smoking,dieting and looking for jobs to support a family. Again the acting is great and there are lots of funny moments. Jackie again steals more episodes, Roseanne and Dan are great and the kids are great. We see less of Crystal and we see Roseanne workign at the Beauty Sallon which was funny. Again we see special feature's liek and interview with John Godman and a season one cast party. The best thing about season 2 was the first Halloween episode which was great."
5,Third Season on Tap for March 2006!!!,"From [...]: ""A 16-year-old Alyson Hannigan (Buffy's 'Willow')guest-stars along with Dann Florek, Shelley Winters, Leonard DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire and recurring Guests Tom Arnold, Martin Mull, and Ned Beatty in Roseanne - The Complete 3rd Season. Expect this 4-DVD set, with original uncut episodes as first broadcast on ABC, to arrive on March 21st for a $39.98 SRP. That's all the information that Anchor Bay has provided so far.""Roseanne Fans Rejoice!!!!"
3,I love the Roseanne show but.......,"I was SO disappointed when my DVD's arrived and found only two episodes are done with commentary. It's really just Roseanne sitting there looking and sounding kind of bored, interrupting the actual show so you can't really watch it at the same time.I guess I really like Reno 911's commentary style, where you can choose to watch the episode with commentary or not, but you don't see anyone. You just hear the voices.So I was let down with this. I really hope someone with power over the Roseanne DVD's actually can make the changes for the next season's release. The ultimate would be each available actor taking turns........just like Reno 911."
5,If You love Roseanne But This. If not why are you looking at this?,"The first few seasons of Rosanne are the best! I could not find a better price on these then amazon. The quality is awesome, the feature to play all episodes or one at a time is great, and we just love this set! My wife and I grew up on Roseanne, so we love these dvd's. We put a dvd in, select play all episodes, and we are instantly whisked away to a time where Roseanne Barr was queen.These sets are a must for any fan and the price is always right"
5,Roseanne Rules The Roost,I can't believe dumb stupid William hates this show but loves Full House...Please!!!!!Oh anyway I love season 2 and the dvd set is superb.....
5,Finally,I love this show. I think it got better and better as the seasons go by. I cant wait to hear the commentary.
1,ripped off!,I ordered the complete second set of Roseanne and received season two of Hercules?? This is such a rip off and i want my money back!!!
1,Not the best by far.,This Software only contains on of the three bibles people normally use. (KJV) the NIV and the NASB are not in this soft ware. I was very disappointed with this software. Not worth the money I spent.
2,The Bible Library Suite,I bought this software to suppliment Quick Verses. It is not close to the ease of use that Quick Verses presents. Additionally the CD cover 'boasts' a number of features that I was not able to access without paying for a password to unlock them! I feel that the product is misrepresented as such. If you want a full featured Bible reference buy Quick Verses instead.
2,Lame,"I'm sorry to the two previous reviews who really enjoyed this dvd. It was an ok video, but not anywhere near worth the $40 I spent on it. I'm upset at myself for buying it as that $40 could've been spent more wisely on something else for my sweet little icelandic filly. I learned some, but not $40 worth. Sorry."
1,Not essential by any means,I've seen this person's writings on the website and can't see the point of his language.What's used orally makes you cringe when you see it in print.No other books of this kind go this way and many have produced books like this so what's the point of another? Its just another opinionated exercise rather than a proper factual one like the Lewisohn books and which ends up being boring and too much Rock Critic for my moneyOne star only because I can't give it any less
3,"Nice set, not complete link to Circo","I bought this expansion set hoping that it would easily connect to a Circo figure 8 set that my son already had. Although the pieces link together without a problem, the Circo figure 8 doesn't contain the 3"" pieces that the Thomas figure 8 set has. Because of this, we couldn't create the expanded track in the directions. My son still has a lot of fun with the set, though."
2,Joints are frustating,"Bought this coz read a lot of good reviews. But then its easy to join and as easily it comes apart, which is when you dont want it to. It locks only in certain position which is frustating.Durable but it should have better latches. Also way expensive for what it is.MY 2.8 yr old soon got frustated and did not like that it would come out often. I had bought it with a different Thomas set with a bridge. ANd that brigde would always fall off....very poor construction, just 5 mm loose pegs! I returned it and bought a Lionel Train track system and it latches real nice and firm and the train is strong and sturdy and well contructed with a remote control."
1,Not made like it used to be,"We ordered the track expansion set and were very excited. We have been using the brand Thomas the Train tracks by Learning Curve for three years and we have never broken a track. The new pieces we received seem as though they are made from different wood. I noticed when we opened them they were different, but I thought maybe it was b/c it had been awhile since we added to our collection. Not even one week of play (and really not hard play as they occasionally run a train on it!) and one of the straightaway pieces developed a crack and splintered off! What?? I know. I looked at the off brand track when I ordered and thought 'No I will pay more because I want this track to last.' I do like the switches and the T track, but for the cost vs. quality it does not add up. Buy the off brand and save your money. What a disappointment."
4,fun with Thomas,"Two of these items were purchased for my grandsons, three and two years old. The cutting of the pattern was not accurate on one of the switches. The two pieces needed to be forced together. My grandsons were unable to do this independently. Once together the two pieces were difficult to interchange into a different pattern. The boys still enjoyed adding it to their existing train system."
5,Thomas fan lives here,"I purchased this set to allow my son more options when creating his railway lines for all his Thomas trains. Not only is the wooden track nice and durable (my little one is 2 and can put a hurting on some toys - as most little boys can), but the reverse side of the straight parts is designed to use as roadway. We don't really need the roadway right now, but it's nice to have as his interest in cars and trucks is increasing. This is a great expansion set, and because we have so much curved and straight track we're thinking about buying another one of these expansion sets. I would definitely recommend this."
5,Opens up so many possibilities...,"The title says it all. When you have a starter set and/or figure 8-set you absolutely have to have an expansion pack like this to open up more options and expand your child's imagination. The wood is quality and, obviously, there are no compatibility issues. Our 2-year old son loves having choices on where he takes his ""boo boo"" (choo choo)! And we like to watch his face light up when he plays. Don't get me wrong, this set certainly seems expensive for what it is...so if you are lucky to find these pieces used (aka cheaper) it would be better. It just might take time to find it. Since there is no star for pricing, this is still a 5-star buy."
4,Fun times on the rail...,"This was a gift for my nephew who is about two, he loves it. One really cool part about this track is that if you flip over the track it becomes a road. The only pieces that are not two sided are the cross overs. Over all very happy with the track and I think would be great for anyone with someone that loves trains or cars."
3,"Good quality, but ...","Bought this to add to the Thomas set. The wood is top quality, well made, but ... what use is the big 'T' shaped piece? Whichever way this is placed, if the train approaches from the horizontal of the 'T' it goes straight across, either direction. If it approaches from the vertical of the 'T' it simply stays straight and drives off the track. This particular piece is an integral part of any expanded layout, but it doesn't work. Hard to understand how the manufacturer could not know this."
5,Grandson loved it!,Our grandson loved his tracks to make his set bigger. Wonderful quality and very sturdy for small children! These have been around for many years and are still made with care.
5,Thomas Track,My son loves this addition to the wooden track he had already - now he can have more shapes and change it up.
4,Wonderful children's book about the dust bowl,This book is a great example of the kindness shown by neighbors and the toughness of the American family farm in the dust bowl era. Excellent illustrations and spare use of text.
5,Precious tale,"This was my 16 year old son's favorite book in first and second grade. We had to have it.Such a nice tale of kindess in this often cold hearted world.Wonderful story, beautiful illustrations.Highly reccomend it."
5,Track List,"1. The Dawn Poems 2. Neuman 3. Dreambeings 4. The White Plague 5. A Loveletter From Sydney 6. Carthage 7. City Of Women 8. Hotel 9. The Empire Mourns Her Sun Without Tears 10.

3,U S Pottery Marks Book,I bought this book in hopes of using it for reference. It's not what I was looking for.
3,"US Marks on Pottery, Porcelain and Clay",I gave it to my son. He's an amateur collector. He's enjoying it very much.
5,Excellent Book,The book arrived on time and the condition was as described (new). The secondary packaging could use improvement as the box had broken and opened at the bottom. The primary packaging was excellent and prevented the book from damage when the box broke.
5,Vast collection of pottery marks,"This book is prodigious in scope: the pottery marks (with huge varieties within each company) and historical information are both invaluable and interesting. However, the indexing is weak, which leads one to thumbing through pages trying to find an elusive mark. This is such a well-researched, vast collection of marks, however, that laborious searches are rewarded."
5,Under the Skin By Michael Faber,"Michael Faber fell into my lap a few summers ago. I wanted something that would hold my interest long enough to keep me from running to EVERY happy hour or weekend tirade. I was also doing a bit of traveling that summer so I was on the hunt for a new author.I first read the Crimson Petal and the White. WOW..... I couldn't put it down and finished the book much faster than I would have liked.Now,a few years later I was looking again for something obscure and remembered Mr. Faber.Great book and Great author for those who like to vacation a bit from the latest newstand mega-release.I love this great find.Stacey Vint-- NJ"
4,Bizarre But Addicting,"What a bizarre story indeed! I have never been more surprised about the journey this book took me on. I was prepared to read a story about a female serial killer only to be given a science fiction twist. If this is not a problem for you I recommend this book highly. The main character is someone you are trying to understand only to have your eyes opened at the end completely! You are in for a wild ride, one you won't want to get off if you're adventurous!"
1,Horrible Book,WOW what a waste of time. I still don't understand the story line and I don't care. I kept waiting for something to make sense but that never happened.
1,Would not recommend,"I read at least 1 or 2 books every week or so and this is possibly the worst book I have ever read. Someone gave this book to me a while ago and since I had run out of books, I decided to read this one. Had I had the time to go get a new book, I would have thrown it out at anytime during the week it took me to read it. I got the feeling he was a card carrying member of PETA and trying to make a statement. I had never heard of this author, so maybe that's what he is all about and if you're into those kind of books, you might like it. I stuck with it until the end.....and it never got any better for me."
1,Lost Credibility,"It started off well. The main character is Isserley, who picks up male hitchhikers in the Scottish Highlands. I was interested, even though I don't know what icpathua is. But come page 135, I left the book. It lost its credibility there. If you've read it, then you'll know why. (DNF)"
4,Surprisingly Enjoyable,"For the first one-third of the book, I thought I'd stumbled upon a novel based on the TV mini-series V. Creepy aliens presenting as humans in order to abduct and eat them. The lead character became increasingly interesting, the use of unknown vocabulary was hilarious, and the underlying themes of carnivorousness, ostracism, and the beauty of fresh air, rain, and snow grabbed me. I'd love another helping of serslida and mussanta paste, but please hold the voddissin."
3,Intrigued then frustrated,"I bought this book because Amazon.com recommended it so highly. It hooked me right at the start. I immediately liked Isserly, the main character, and was almost obsessively intrigued by the creepy mystery at the novel's core. However, as Faber repeatedly would pull the dangling carrot out of my reach, I became frustrated. I think the book could have been as gripping and interesting if the reader were let in on a few secrets earlier (perhaps even from the beginning?). But, I must applaud Faber for his dark imaginings and making a very foreign different world crystal clear to me as a reader."
2,Disappointing...,"I discovered that this book is supposedly the basis for Jonathan Glazer's newest film. Glazer directed Sexy Beast and Birth which are both brilliant movies, so naturally I was intrigued by this author. I just finished the book and I have to say I'm quite disappointed. I generally like science fiction, but this book doesn't work as science fiction. There are no explanations of who these visitors are, how they got here or why they're doing what they're doing. In 200+ pages we get a lot of flowery details on the scenery, but little actual plot or character development. The ending is sudden and unsatisfying. Based on this book I will very likely not be reading any more of Faber's work. I will however see Glazer's movie if and when it's ever released."
2,"Although well-written, too disturbing for me","Just a warning to people who don't enjoy horror (like me) - it's not until you're well into the book that the story suddenly explodes into a horror tale.No question that this book is well-written and engaging, but the imagery is graphic and honestly, pretty sick. The book subtly baits your interest with hints that something mysterious and unusual is going on...but you'll have no idea how horrific the situation is until it's too late.Perhaps this book redeems itself later on, but I won't be reading anymore of it. I love science fiction, but this book was way too disturbing for me."
1,"Great idea, shame about the book","It's a promising premise: a strong female protagonist on a mission with a dark secret is on the lookout for hunky Scottish men. Nice. Unfortunately Faber's plot build-up is obvious, if not trite. The clunky construction betrays the author thinking aloud to himself: ""and this is where I put in the clue about her background""; ""if I make her look funnily at him here then readers should catch on to what I've been getting at about X""; etc. This book is about a single idea, which is so under-developed that if your best friend had told it to you over a drink, you would have laughed and sworn that it'd never get published. This is not a triumph - it's just a leaking plot that Faber attempts to cover up with gruesome imagery and heavy-handed suspense."
2,Better Reads Else Where,"I got this book (thank God from the Library rather than with my after tax cash) based on it's being in a book titled ""1,000 Books You Must Read Before You Die"". Well, having read a great many classics (by such as Tolstoy, Woolf, Nabokov, Chaucer, and so on) I can state that it is NOT a book I feel need be read before one dies. Repetitive, dreary, almost absurd in its ""plot"" I gave it even two stars most reluctantly. That part of Mr. Fabers career includes being ""a guinea pig for medical research"" may have a lot to do with his writing and fantasy."
1,got under my skin,"I bought and read a copy while in London several months ago after reading a review in a bookshop. I found this novel ridiculously implausible, truly creepy and repulsive; yet, at the same time, I couldn't put it down as it is well written. The main character is an unforgetable ""lady."" In my view, you're better off waiting for your teenage kids to see the movie and telling you about it."
5,Very thought provoking,"When I saw that a movie was going to be made of this book staring Scarlett Johansson, I decided to read it before the movie came out. Very interesting commentary on the human condition from an outsider's point of view. Don't want to give away any spoilers, but I loved how it gave little clues all along as to what was really happening, but wasn't obvious at first. Can't wait to see S.J.'s interpretation of the main character. The author succeeds in creating a surreal atmosphere around the thought processes going on. Recommend to anyone with an imagination."
4,More human than human,"Under The Skin is a commentary on the human condition, from two ""human"" perspectives. What starts out as a seemingly normal novel, gets a boost of the surreal when you realize what characters are calling themselves ""human beings"". The book is really a tragedy about struggling with life and your place in the world."
5,Absolutely right.,"I read, approximately, about 200 books a year. Most of these are brain candy, little easy books that feed my desire to escape and do nothing else. Most of the books written today are like that, a nice story and nothing more. I'd almost forgotten how it felt to read something like this. I wish there were another star I could add to my rating to show that this book really is something extrordinary. I think it has a perception of beauty; it made me want to cry.I'm deeply indebted to the other reviewers who did not give away the story, so I will keep my fingers quiet about the plot. Suffice to say that all is not what is seems, and by the time you have an idea of what's going on you've been slipped oh-so-silently into a perception of the world that is different than your own, and it is beautiful and funny and monstrous, and when you're done reading I hope you understood it.I'll be keeping an eye out for more by this author."
3,Written superbly,I LOVED Faber's novel The Crimson Petal and The White so much that I picked up this novel as well. I sadly did not really care for this one. The reason why she is picking up hitchhikers doesn't do much for me and we never seem to find out what she is. I understand we are supposed to study the human condition in this book and make revelations from Faber's writing but I didn't get it on a deeper level. It was very well written though and you were interested for most of the book because you were trying to figure out what was going on.
4,Sci-Fi Noir,"This unique, wonderfully horrifying book reminded me of a great noir film: dark, pessimistic, disturbing and complete with a truly lethal femme fatale. I read it months ago, and still can't forget it. Faber really does get under the skin."
3,Another Black Widow spider story,"A morally conflicted female driver lures hitchikers to their doom... (I will not spill the beans about the Secret in this book.)A fun little sci-fi novella, though Borders bookstore fails to place it in the sci-fi section for an unknown reason (because Faber has been typecast as a historical novelist?).Now for the negs. Michel Faber does not shrink from being gross. Carry your barf bag. Sex appeal is nil. Another negative is that his understanding of actual science is limited. To say the plot is far-fetched would be an understatement. He should enroll in some basic science courses at the local university over there in Scotland, and maybe hire a professor to proofread his novel for scientific impossibilities and improbabilities next time he plans to try his hand at sci-fi.All that taken into consideration, it was still a good read, possibly because Faber just has a good writing style that tempts us to overlook logical considerations."
5,Very different and memorable,"I purchased this book from amazon in the summer of 2000 after seeing a review of it in a magazine. Twelve years later, mental images from this story still stick with me. I cannot say the same for most books I've read. I hated for the book to end because I was so into it. The bizarre twist that it took was the farthest thing from my mind when I started reading it. I think I may dig this out of storage and read it again."
4,"Shades of Cormac McCarthy's ""Child of God.""","Can't ruin premise by detailing the analogy, but if you know Cormac McCarthy's small gem, ""Child of God,"" you will find that Faber's excellent novel explores the same philosophical territory, forcing you to confront your own worldview to sympathize with an amoral protagonist. It's a testament to his powers as a writer that he bends genres (and I won't say which, a spoiler) to do it."
2,Ick,"In one work, ick. I have read two other novels by Faber, The Crimson Petal and the White and The Courage Consort. Both were excellent. I finished this one thinking WTF did I just read. Yes, it was creepy. But in the end what was the point? Creepy for creepy's sake? It was a let-down, particularly since it was well written."
3,I wanted to love it,"I really, truly wanted to love this book. I really enjoyed the setup -- the story of Isserley and her trips up and down the A9 picking up hitchhikers, the slow revelation that Isserley isn't ""normal"", etc., -- but as soon as the mystery is truly revealed, it felt very anti-climactic. I had also hoped that with the understanding of why Isserley does what she does, there would be more background on Isserley herself.That being said, Faber is a bright and talented author and I'm looking forward to reading more of his work."
5,bigeyes,"the colors are fantastic and the newness of the art is eye popping.i study picasso for 30yrs .this book is exceptional.i hope to find it to buy it , but no luck so far.the inventiveness of these paintings oh boy are fantasystick. where is my copy?"
4,Green Spot Bulb,I have several of these (different colors) at the base of some tall palm trees and they really give that lovely tropical look.
5,I have never seen a book like this,"This is a great book for anyone, not just builders. The Lingo Guide for Builders is the only bi-lingual book I have ever seen that actually is user friendly with relavant phrases for any part of construction work. It doesn't have short phrases like ""go get that"" like other books I have bought. The Lingo Guide has phrases like ""We need to stack the lumber there."" and ""How are you today?"" This book has been extremely helpful and fun. Communication made simple. I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
4,One single missing...,"It didn't really suprise me, but still it's a bit depressing. The single ""High Cool"" is not within this box. Which still makes that one hardcore rare with only 500 copies. Just for you to know true lovers."
5,Essential Blur,"Blur is, hands down, the best British rock band of the last 15 years (yes, even better than Radiohead...Blur did it FIRST, did it better, and without the ridiculous overhyping and pretension). This box set contains all of Blur's 22 singles (up to the point that this was released...they released 4 more singles....Music is My Radar, Out of Time, Crazy Beat, and Good Song) and their b-sides, all in the original sleeves. Blur is one of those bands (along with Suede) where the b-sides were usually top-notch quality, and that's borne out in this set. Check out Young and Lovely, Ultranol, Explain, No Monsters in Me, Bone Bag, Peach, Tame, Magpie, All We Want, All Your Life, and Polished Stone (just to name a few)! Fantastic. While this is hard to find, especially in America, for a true Blur fan, it's essential."
4,classic Brit Pop.......and more,"I had the privilege to se the band live last December in Newport,Wales,and to hear them play all 22 (I think) singles in cronological order was ,well, sweet heaven,great songs,VERY talented musicians,I used to rate Oasis well above Blur back in the mid 90s,but times have changed,Oasis haven't.Go on ,give them a try"
5,The best British band of the 90's,"This box-set is definitely worth having if your a keen Blur fan, mainly because it gives you the chance to hear all the b-sides they've released. There's an amazing variety of songs showing how Blur have made quite radical changes through the years and haven't just stuck to the same style and become boring (like a certain band from Manchester). My favourite tracks are Young & Lovely, Beachcoma, Peach, Magpie, Threadneedle Street, No Monsters In Me, Tame, and All We Want. Because there's so many tracks you could up with a completely different list of songs and they would still all be great."
1,No Volume,"I have tried to play this video a number of times after purchasing it, and there is no volume. I have no problems with my tv or other videos, so it must be this video. My son asks every day to watch it, and every day I have to tell him it doesn't work."
2,bad how-to-do book,"although a great academic thesis on fiberglass and all its theory and its compositional attributes of high polymerisation... bla bla bla.. OK I was lost too throught the entire book. This is for someone that masters plastics and wants that higher edge. For beginners it really dont tell you how to start, how to proceed and what really is that you looking for."
5,The Fibreglass Manual,"This book covers a wide range of Fiberglass molding techniques. It has a good introduction to the basic materials, mold construction, glassing techniques and gel coating techniques. There are many illustrations to support the written text. With this book, you should be able to create simple molded parts."
3,needs more how to,If your just starting out this is not much help. but combined with other books it can be very heplful.
2,Works with FEW PRINTERS,After selecting this print server to work with my VISTA 64bit computer. I later found out from USR Tech support that this print server does not work with my HP 1200 printer. Kind of upset after I spent over $100.00 on it.
4,A Great Game,"This game is absolutely awesome! You go back in time through a time-teleporter, and hunt dinosaurs for people who want them. Some missions include getting a dead Tyrannosaurus rex for a guy who wants it's head, killing a Styracosaurus for a Chinese-food retaurant, getting live Utahraptors for a research center, and many, many, many (many many many) more. This game is really suspenseful, sometimes, when your hunting a dinosaur, you get stalked by a raptor, troodon, or an occasional T-rex. They growl when they get close by, so you know it's coming, but you dont exactly know when. It's a BIG surprise when you get attacked. I almost had a heart-attack when a utah raptor jumped me. The dino's in this game are Quetzalcoatlus, Triceratops, Styracosaurus, Gastonia, Utahraptor, Troodon, Iguanadon, Lambeosaurus and T-rex. The only bad thing about this game is that after you play about 2 missions, it goes back to your computer desktop and you have to re-boot the game."
2,Would be decent except for the fog...,"This would be a fun game, however there is a constant fog around your character so that there is no way to know that an dinosaur is near you until you're within 15 feet of it, which when you're hunting something like a T. Rex, makes it extremely frustrating to play. Since there is no hope of a patch or a fix for this that I can find, I would recommend that all but the most dedicated fans avoid purchasing this."
1,slow learner,"We purchased this game years ago and it kept crashing. My kids loved the game and we thought it might be our computer so we purchased it again...still locked up the computer. It is a fun game when it works, but after purchasing it twice it still doesn't work. I guess I am a slow learner."
1,totally exasperated - lyrics only - letras sin melodia,"Letras sin melodias - There are only lyrics and a few chord symbols in this book - no melody line. I thought I was getting a book of songs. It is only a book of lyrics. I feel the title is deceptive, since mere chord symbols really do not amount to an ""acompanamiento""."
4,Great Biblical Resource,"As one who has never traveled outside the USA, this book was great as it gave me an idea of what it 'looks like' over there in Israel. It is an excellent resource for any Biblical studies."
5,Easy Read--High Interest,Journey through the Bible is a great resource for helping people understand the cultures of the Bible. It's easy to read and keeps the interest of young and old.
4,The Victor Journey through the Bible,"I purchased this book in Jun 2012. I enjoy the little nuggets in this handbook, just not enough of them (the nuggets) on each subject; hence, I give it four stars. The topics are clear to the understanding and the maps and charts are excellent. It is a good source of information."
2,"Same same - ""me too book""","Well, this is another one of those ""me too"" book.The author has attempted to put all aspects of the game into this book but there are no new, breakthru or innovative materials/ideas."
2,Wasn't what I expected,"I bought this to see if I could use this to help train for my first full IM event. Maybe I can, if I read it again and again, and take the tips where you find them. Other than that, to me it is hard to follow, some of it seems designed for Elite Pros and then lapses into a tidbit for beginners. If you are like me, an average guy, looking for a very easy to read, yet comprehensive book with full training plans and all the background and reasoning behind the plans, choose Don Fink's Be Ironfit instead -- it is perfect and exactly what I needed."
5,Ironman Training,Anyone training for an Ironman competition should check out these training tips. Triathletes will also find this to be an invaluable resource.
2,Way too complicated unless u r a pro triathlete,"If u are a beginner or this will be your first Ironman, don't bother getting this book. I have done many sprint tri's n several half marathons but this book is so complicated, you need a degree in exercise physiology to interpret it! It does not just come out n say, do this on Monday, do this on Tuesday, etc. It might as well be written in Chinese!"
3,Just o.k.,"This is the first book I've read in Breed Series and it was just o.k. I did'nt love or hate Megan or Braden for that matter. The sex scenes were decent if not repetitive. Towards the end, I didn't even care if the characters lived or died. On to the next...hopefully better."
4,Better than most,"Maybe I've just read too many crappy erotic romances lately, but Megan's Mark was a relief. Lora Leigh does an admirable job with her sex scenes, and I appreciated Megan's attitude. Braden is definitely alpha, and I especially liked how they came to terms with their similar personalities. And heck, I like sensual biting!But when it comes time to explain important plot points, Leigh's narrative gets confusing. I found myself re-reading at some of the worst moments... I still don't understand how the plot resolved, actually. That said, I wasn't looking for an especially deep plot. It made for a good summer read."
5,Loved this whole series,I never read paranormal but then was introduced to Loras brand of paranormal and i fell in love with everyone especially Megan. She is not the last paranormal book but one of my very favorite and cant wait to read more. BRAB Challenge
4,Strap yourself in for a hot and bumpy ride!!!,"This is the book that got searching out Lora Leigh books and for the most part I haven't been disappointed yet. Hot sex, good plot and action that keeps the pace moving. Its been several months since I read the book....hmmm I might just have to curl up with it tonight."
3,"Love the series, but not feeling this book.","I am a HUGE fan of the paranormal romance genre, and this series particularly (in addition to Immortals After Dark, Demonica, and Lords of the Underworld). But this story...I don't know. I guess I just couldn't get into it. I felt the same way about Kiss of Heat (Sherra and Kane's story) but not to the degree of this one. I hate to admit it, but I found myself skimming. I hope the rest of the book in the series are more engaging."
5,Loved it!! Sexy and exciting!!,"I love this book! I love the sexual tension, the connection between them was intense. The sex was hot, hot, hot!!! The action in this book was awesome! It all evened out and I just loved it, can't wait for the next one. Lora Leigh is becoming one of my fav's!!!"
4,"Strange, emotional and very very rude.","This book caught me completely by surprise.I knew nothing about the author and thought I was reading just another poor paranormal.Until about half-way through when the true nature of the story was revealed. Not pink or purple either. A solid blue. Fine.What I don't get at all is the cultural arena in which it is set. Something like native american via the mengele labs in the third reich death camps. I'm still shaking my head in mystification.However since I absolutely loved The Odessa File which I read years ago and which unfortunately spawned absolutely no clones, I'll stick with the series for a little while.Btw. For those who don't know. All feral cats have barbs."
3,Same Lora Leigh . . . but a more affordable price!,"If you're a Lora Leigh fan, a fan of Ellora's cave or just a fan of romance books with a steamier edge, you'll enjoy this latest in the Breed series. Don't worry if you haven't read any of the other books, it's not necessary. Megan's Mark has everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, that you expect from a Lora Leigh book: alpha hero, strong heroine, plenty of sexual tension, and some pretty hot and, uh, adventurous bedroom scenes. So if you like your romances with an extra kick, check this one out.Oh, and . . . the three stars was intentional. Why after such a seemingly positive review? Because it is what it is: romantica. It's a very rare book that relies heavily on the sex which rises above a three star review. It's not the best I've ever read, but it is a fun read."
2,not her best,I've read several Lora Leigh books and this one falls short. The main character is fluff and the romance lackluster.
2,Just a warning,"I have recently started doing reviews because I realize how imporatnt they are in my decision making. With that in mind I wanted to give a quick warning. If you love hot sex scenes and virtually no plot, this book is for you. I am not a lover of erotica but I do read it occasionally and in my opinion, this book was subpar as a mainstream attempt. Do not get me wrong, I had read Ms. Leigh's other erotica concerning the breeds and the concept is very good. I thought that it would be a good device to sedgeway erotica and romantic suspense. It did not happen. Braden is bothersome. The heroine is not much better. As far as using the ploy that they must have sex or die, Leigh could have altered that. Kept the urge but killed the need. For erotica fans, this may be a good read. There is a little meat on the bone. But for fans of romantic suspense that are used to great and compelling stories sprinkled with great love scenes that actually have a purpose....this may not be for you"
2,It was OK,"The plot of the book was rather intriguing, but the character's reactions were rather on the unbelievable side. If you are going to have a romance flavor, I would like to read the romance, not he bites her and she just can't resist him because of some weird hormone that he injected in her. Not to mention, I'm really not big on the strong-willed woman gets ""seduced"" into turning into a floppy, hormone stiken love slave, just because of a good set of abs, and a big..."
2,The cover is better than the book,"I am very tired of reading ""romance"" books where abuse is called love and rape is called passion. The heroine says ""no"" repeatedly but the hero continues to sneer at her wishes, he's amused and disrespecful. There is a long scene where his goal is to break her and force her into submission. I was sickened by his sexual torture.The so-called erotic language is dreadful. The words are crude and the sex lacks imagination.Every man in the heroine's life worked very hard to make all her decisions for her although she did try to fight back and be her own person. It just felt like her charater was crushed under all the men in her world.I won't be loaning this book to my friends. There are some interesting ideas in this book and had the hero been a little likeable and had the heroine not been a vicitim it might have been an enoyable read."
3,"Interesting premise, but not well executed","While I enjoyed Megan's Mark, it took me forever to get into the story. I found Megan to be a bit over the top. I couldn't really be impressed with someone who wants to be this super tough warrior woman, but at the same time lives in a secluded Arizona desert far far away from danger and excitement. It doesn't match. As for Braden, the whole alpha male thing he had going was exciting, and I liked him for that reason, but couldn't believe he'd fall for some callow thing like Megan who couldn't seem to make up her mind whether she even wanted to be with him. This was my first Lora Leigh book and first introduction to the Breeds, and while I liked the premise well enough, this one just wasn't executed to my satisfaction. As a whole, I liked this book in parts, but not the story as a whole. Still, it was interesting enough that I will check out more of the Breed stories."
5,Just loved it!!,I just sooooo.... loved this book. I think it's my favorite of the series. Counting down until the next one in the series. Keep them coming Lora.
3,Eh...,"This book was on its way to at least a 4-star review from me, 'til Braden went over-the-top alpha toward the end. Up until then, the storyline was very interesting (this is my first Breeds book) and I liked both of the two main characters. I especially liked that Megan was so strong and independent. But by the end Braden had to show her who was boss with a rather disturbing anal sex scene that instead of being an exploration of intimacy is rather a crude dominance/submission struggle used to put Megan in her place. I guess if you are into that sort of thing, this will be right up your alley. But I like more romance in my love scenes, so this left me disappointed and cheapened the rest of the story."
2,"Just too much sex, and LOTS of icky language","I certainly like sex in books, but there is barely any story here. Just a huge string of sex scenes, which are all basically the same. Also, I just don't care for nasty slang. Constant use of unflattering names for female genitalia wrecks the mood for me. If you don't care for this, be aware that every third page or so is full of it. I really wanted to like these books, because I like the premise. But I want to read a story with sex and romance, not page after page of gutter talk. If that appeals, then you might love this book, as apparently others have."
3,"Should be listed as EROTICA, not romance","This book is OK. I'll probably read the series. However, I'll get all the books via the library... the book isn't worthy of purchasing because I don't feel I'll read it again.Also, FYI, it is extremely graphic on the sex, so if you are not into that kind of book, I would suggest not reading it at all. This book should have been listed as erotica due to content, not romance. I personally have no problem with erotica; it just caught me off guard because I thought I had picked up a sci-fi romance..."
1,too many filthy words,Wow - I have to say I was shocked. I don't mind a sex scene - but the words she uses for shock value are over the top - and it is dedicated to her mother and father - who read all her work? Wow - what kind of a trashy family does she come from!
4,Wallplates,"Not a whole lot to say about this Decora wall plate, it is brand new and comes in retail packaging."
5,Excellent read,"Frost managed to find an excellent mix between the facts of the battle, and giving a dramatic narrative of what it was like to be there. The sections on the ""Death Ride"" of the German Battlecruisers will give you a feeling of the horror, duty and honor that bound the men into this battle. He cuts few corners when showing the mistakes that were made, but does not second guess the ship and fleet commanders by using information they did not have. While some books might do a better job with the technical details of this battle, overall Frost tells the story of the conflict better than anybody else."
4,Wow! impressed.,I was honestly a little skeptical when I downloaded this. The reviews were mixed but I love S.E.P. so I gave it a shot. I was amazed! It wasn't. What I was expecting to be honest it was like reading a drama movie rather than just romance. SEP created characters you could like as much as you hate them. It was definitely a darker book than the norm but it was in my opinion a happy wholesome ending. I recommend it for sure.
5,"Excellent, older novel by SEP","I have read all but 1 of Susan Elizabeth Phillips books. Last summer I read my first SEP book as it had good ratings and sounded like a great read. Honey Moon is one of her earlier books and I must say, one of my favorites. Her character exploration is so deep and she makes you feel as though you know the characters inside out. Don't hesitate to pick this book up--it starts off a little slow, but by chapter 2 you won't be able to put it down."
5,Great Book,"My wife talked me into reading this (bless her nagging heart).Romance novel, maybe so, but if you want a great read - you found it.If you're looking for a take-your-mind-out-of-gear book - keep looking."
5,Better than the reviews would lead you to think,"One of Susan Elizabeth Phillips best. More in the vein of DREAM A LITTLE DREAM than, say, FANCY PANTS. Its not as full of good ole boy humor as some of her others but rather is full of deep emotions and characters. The emotional growth of the characters over time is very moving. I like all of her books but this one and DREAM A LITTLE DREAM are the ones I read over. If you are looking for the simple - guy meets girl, a few problems, jump into bed, live happily ever after with their one true love, kind of book - look again. Life, love and literature are more interesting than that."
4,A change of pace for Susan Elizabeth Phillips,"Even though this is not your typical romance, most readers will really enjoy it. It is the story of Honey Moon, a young girl from a rough background who rather accidentally finds herself the star of a TV show. The romance in the book is generally pretty good, but the more interesting part of the book is Honey's growth from a tough, unloved girl, to an emotionally dependent wife, to an independent and fully mature woman. As usual, Susan Elizabeth Phillips is adept at adding touches of humor and creating interesting, multi-dimensional characters. It's a good read. Nevertheless, if you're reading it just for the romance, you will find it only marginally satisfying."
1,"This one gave me the creeps! It's not dark, it is gross!","Okay, okay, I realize that this is going to be one of those dividing books that one either loves or hates, and it being an SEP book, I thought my initial feelings would change. Sorry, uh-huh, it still makes me cringe. Besides the ickiness of Honey and Dash getting together (he had been her father-figure), I never really came to understand or care about the characters. Yes, I saw all of the 5-star ratings calling this book emotionally-riveting, but I kept thinking how in need of a shrink all of the characters were! Yuck! Gross! Eeck! So glad this wasn't my first SEP book, or I'd never touch another with a ten-foot pole."
1,"Terrible, depressing and not worth buying","DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!! If you have, you would most probably throw it away as far as you can. I am glad I have bought her other books that are very good. This one is depressing, all her characters are stuck in their past and struggling too hard to move on. The man the heroine loved get killed in the process, another character get accused as a pedophiliac and lo and behold! The rollercoaster solve the problems! This book should never go out to print under SEP's name... use another alias! You get you money worth buying It Had To Be You, Kiss An Angel, Nobody Baby's But Mine."
1,Terrible and depressing,"This book was awful! I've never read a book before where every character practically screamed ""I NEED THERAPY!"" The potential for a good book was there but Phillips killed her story with her deeply disturbing characters. What's the use in a romance novel if the ending isn't happy, but bittersweet?"
5,Simply wonderful. Emotionally powerful.,"I have read many of Susan E. Phillips books. This one was different from the others I have read because the characters were complex and the story deeply emotional. I couldn't put it down! I liked it better than any of her other works because of its complexity and depth.Wonderful read, really a keeper."
5,Great Read!,I have read several of her books now and I love them all. This one is different from the others. It's darker and less predictable. But it still has the wonderful characters that make SEP books such a joy to read.
3,Mediocre or Brillant?,"Reading the reviews I have to ask...if it can make you cry and hate some of the characters...is that not brilliant writing? Or is it only writing that makes you feel good that is worthy?I do feel she did not develop the second romance to the best of her ability, however, in some places she brought me to tears. Very definitely a ""different"" feel than most SEP novels but I'm still glad I read it."
1,"I love her books, but found this one very different.","I found this whole story far-fetched from the beginning. I just never got involved with Honey, in fact, I didn't like her or believe her. I couldn't seem to put it down either. I found the part on child abuse so upsetting. I just wanted it to get over. Give me Heaven,Texas or any others. Has this been my first book of hers, I never would have read another."
2,Don't bother,"I am glad that I had read some of her other books before this. I made myself finish it and I would not do that again. I never cared about Honey and I just don't see how the rollercoaster solved her problems. Read _It Had To Be You_, _Heaven, Texas_ or _Dream A Little Dream_ instead."
2,Not one of her better ones,"Though I did not enjoy this book very much I adore most of Susan Elizabeth Philip's books. If you are new to SEP, please do not read this one first because it will undoubtedly turn you off from her other books. I suggest reading Nobody's Baby but Mine, or Heaven, Texas for the best of her work to date. I think it's still good to read all her books to see how she has grown as a writer, but don't start with Honeymoon, or Hot Shot (this on is even worse)."
1,Not up to par!,"Such a disappointment!! I read nearly all of Phillips books. Many I love, the rest I really like. This was horrible! The characters were unlikeable, the story unbelievable, and the relationships ridiculous. I'm not clear if Phillips was trying something new but she should stick to what she is good at... lighthearted romances with spicy, likeable characters and plausible (mostly) relationships."
4,"A tough, but touching read (not your average romance)","I have not read all of SEP's books, but Honey Moon is my favourite so far. In fact, I think that it just might be my favourite romance book ever...and I've read a lot of them!The main attraction is the characters. They are wounded, flawed and inescapably human. I found them utterly believable- even if their situations were anything but! My family has foster kids, and trust me, SEP characterizations of adults dealing with childhood abandonment issues is dead on. And while Romance is a genre synononmous with escapism, I think this book effectively combines both real life problems, with the fairytale quality that SEP is known for. It's not enough for these characters to find love. They need redemption too.Boy, do we have to work hard for that happy ending...but I found it all the sweeter for the effort."
3,Not as good as the others are...,"I fell in love w/ Susan Elizabeth Phillips after reading NOBODY'S BABY BUT MINE. I had to read every book she has written! I have read most of them, lacking FANCY PANTS (my next) and IT HAD TO BE YOU (have to find it!). This one was my least favorite so far. It is incredibly slow well into the book, atleast 150 pgs. I am so used to her other books having BIG happenings in the first few chapters. I have to admit that I started liking it towards the end but, a little too late in my opinion. I really enjoyed seeing Honey grow up into a loving woman. It is so ironic w/ who she finally ends up with. I found it a little strange to see her marry Dash, wondering how a woman could go from loving her ""father figure"" to loving him as a husband. This book also has some terrible issues w/ sex abuse that I couldn't read b/c it hit too close to home. That's just my opinion.."
2,"If you are looking of a light read - avoid this ""dark"" story","SEP's books are usually funny and the characters are so lovable. This story was depressing from start to finish. The heroine actually marries her onscreen ""father"". He is killed. She falls for another man named Eric who is accused of molesting his down syndrome daughter and other daughter. How much more depressing could this book possibly get? SEP should check her estrogen levels."
3,A mixed review,"I give the first half of the book, Honey and Dash's story, 4 stars. It is very well written, and we get a great deal of insight on the characters. SEP makes it easy to see why these two people fall in love despite their age differences, and I was happy for them. The second half of the book, Honey and Eric's story, gets only 2 stars from me because it is so rushed and feels forced. SEP has to quickly get two people together who didn't get along years before and have been out of each others' lives for a long time. While the lust they first feel is believeable (and their first sex scene short but hot) the ""true love"" that quickly follows is not. It feels like the author took the shortest route to a happy ending, but I was left feeling unhappy for this pair. Their foundation doesn't seem firm enough for a lasting relationship. I'll stick to the ""Chicago Stars"" books from now on. Better to re-read a classic."
4,"While not one of SEP's best, this is a very enjoyable novel.","I have read all of SEP's books, and while not her best, this is a very enjoyable book. Not your typical romance story, SEP never goes for the standard plot twists, her stories are always very original. Honey Moon is a great heroine, who goes from nothing to become a famouse TV actress. She falls in love with her co-stars, one a burned-out cowboy and the other a sex symbol. The book spans a long time so we get to see Honey grow from a cheeky brat to an outspoken young woman. Just when you think you know what is going to happen, the author throws an unexpected twist and your off in another direction entirely!!"
4,"If you love stories involving Hollywood, then read this book","I found this book to be quite interesting. There were always twists and turns in this book, that held my interest to the final page. As with all of SEP books, I was sorry to see it end. And, I love the location of Hollywood for the setting for this book."
1,Never read this book,"This book was disappointing. Not fun at all to read. I found myself wanting to hand the characters the pistol so they could put there shallow, lame selves out of my misery. I'm not kidding. I wouldn't even donate this book to a prison. Normally S.E.P. books rock, are funny, and inspiring. This one is TRASH."
3,Just so-so....,"I usually LOVE her books, but was a little dissapointed with this one. If someone is just starting her books, I would recomment ""Match Me if you Can"" or another....just not what I expected."
4,"Tragedies and tears, with eventual fulfillment.","Normally I prefer Susan Phillips' comedies. This was not one of them, but I enjoyed it anyway. I had tears several times, and then there was love and warmth later. I liked the characters, their good sides, bad sides and other sides. I liked her plot development. She is a fine author. The three main characters had troubled childhoods, loss of parents, foster care, etc. but eventually found love. Sexual content: mild. Genre: contemporary romance.OTHER BOOKS:For a list of my reviews of other Susan Elizabeth Phillips books, see my 5 star review of ""Glitter Baby"" posted 1/15/09."
3,"Better Than Most Guidebooks About New Mexico, Although...","Moon Handbooks' New Mexico Guidebook (6th Edition) was the second Moon Handbook that I purchased. The first one I purchased was Nevada by Deke Castleman (also 6th Edition) - which is very helpful and fun to read, by the way. Unfortunately, it was obvious while reading the New Mexico guidebook that the author, Stephen Metzger, does not live in New Mexico, and often seems unfamiliar with the state throughout the book. I really would have liked to have more information about the city of Rio Rancho (only one page for a city of about 66,000 people!). I have traveled to New Mexico twice since purchasing this book and have discovered a lot of beautiful places, good restaurants, and unusual retail establishments that were not mentioned. Although it does have some good information (better than most about New Mexico), this book barely scratches the surface."
1,Buyer beware,"This program is a complete waste of time. I tried installing it twice. The first time; it hung my computer up so badly, I had to pull the plug out of the wall to shut it off. When I finally got the computer working, it wouldn't recognize my D: drive ( CD rom ), nor my new Plextor CD-RW drive ""F"".I don't know why I tried again, but I did, with simularly disasterous results!"
2,disappointing,"Yeah, I know this is bottom-of-the-barrel stuff, but it's still disappointing. Seems to copy CDs well enough, but oddly, seems to have trouble copying material from my hard drive. I'd advise the humble consumer to spend a few more dollars and look elsewhere."
1,"""Boo-Hiss""","Ok...so I am somewhat of a rookie at burning CD's, however this software stinks. I have a brand spankin' new Dell with all the memory that any Grandma would cherish. Of course, my CD-RW drive is not supported by this software and I too rec'd the cold shoulder from customer service. They gave me absolutely no time line on updated drivers and also had the nerve to tell me that I had to go back and check their list periodically to see if my drive had been added. Wow! Now THAT made me feel like I was a priority...I will try to return to Best Buy today, if not I will throw it on the ground and stomp on it until I am breathless....."
1,I was burnt not my cd's,I recently broght the software from target. when i upgraded to xp pro my Roxio no longer worked. not wanting to pay $50 for roxio i decided to go cheaper. I have now wasted more money on CD-R that the program has messed up. I will now have to go and buy a more expencive but much more reliable piece of software. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY THIS!!! IT SHOULD HAVE -50 STARS!
4,Great product!,"Yes it's loud, but I wanted a powerful fan and I got one! No, it's not going to hurt your ears unless you're a little sensitive to noises. Great product. Seems like good quality. Yes, it's anoying having the control on the plug-in, but that's better than no control!"
4,Powerful Fan!,"This is EXACTLY what I was looking for, a VERY POWERFUL fan to defrost my old Jeep, since the defrost/heater fan failed.Yes, it makes a fair amount of noise at full blast (not a problem) and less when turned down with its integral rheostat. A joint in its mount had broken on the one I first received, eventually replaced by the seller (cost me return postage though). Take-home lesson: Plastic Breaks!I am not sure how I will attach the big clip to the dash (no real way to do that), but overall I am quite pleased with the item. If it also had a heater it would be awesome."
1,Junk,"The concept of this fan is great. The fan itself is very disappointing. It was very loud and rattles. It is cheaply made. The housing that holds the motor cracked the second time I used it. The fan blade came apart and disintegrated. I would look for another cooling device besides this one. Several co-workers have tried the Roadpro and were also dissapointed in its performance and construction. It only works if used on a low setting, which is no good in the summertime in Florida."
2,clip on noise maker,i brought these fans to help my small children in the back of my bronco. they blow alot of air but make it impossible to hear anything. if you lower the speed so they are not as loud the volume of air blown drops dramatically. i wouldnt buy again
2,L O U D as bombs!,"I can't for the life of me imagine someone being able to try this first, then one of the dozen or so alternatives, then purchasing this. I can best compare it to my red TORO 110/120 volt leaf blower in noise output. It simply doesn't need to be this loud. Only positive attributes are its compact form factor and strong clip. If you are deaf or hard of hearing, or wish to soon be that way, this product is for you. Otherwise keep looking or you can buy mine at my next garage sale. I turned it on and then put it in a drawer and it's been there since."
2,noisey fan,Product sounds exactly like a hair dryer on high. Not a pleasant sound in a closed vehicle. I suspect its relatively high volumebut theres no specifications to tell you. Generally well made with adjustable speed on plug. I only recommend it for ventilating a closed vehicle for a pet in your absence no human could stand the continuos racket.
3,Powerful but loud,I bought this to help keep my dog cool on long trips in the back of my car. I just received it the other day and tested it out...so loud! The electric fan motor makes a high pitched wining sound that I'm not sure if I will be able to stand for very long. I'm taking a long trip this weekend so I will test it out and see. I will say that it is a very powerful fan and it is nice to have the speed adjustment on the 12 V adapter.
3,loud,"i bought this despite the reviews of the loudness factor... it works well, but it truly is horribly loud. upside is that it keeps you off your cell while in the car.... too loud for that!"
1,cheap construction,"Came with broken stem where fan connects to swivel clamp. I was going to return item, but it was NOT a returnable item; could NOT get a replacement."
3,"Moves LOTS of air, makes LOTS of noise","I bought this for my nephew whose hard-earned first car had non-functional air conditioning. It worked very well and clipped securely on the passenger side vizor, pointed directly at the driver. But, he took it down and put it away after just a day. Seems the noise was ""ridiculous"" and interfered with his music.Comfort just can't compete with tunes when you're seventeen."
2,not so hot,"wanted this for my postal vehicle, but it was too noisy. On the other hand it did not break like the previous fan."
3,Permanent mounting base was not included,Permanent mounting base was not included as shown in photos and in description of item (see the show more option) so that is why I give it 3 stars. I am using it as it is in my John Deere x 729 hard cab as a defroster and I clipped the fan to one of the door handles. It works but I was looking forward to mounting it with the non existent base shown in the photos. BTW the thing is LOUD as others have stated but I use my tractor with hearing protection so no big deal for me.
2,Broken Fan,I can't really comment on the fan since it arrived broken. The plastic part where the clip meets the fan was snapped in half. Will probably order another one to try it out. I will say the fan is larger than I thought. Looking to put it in my plane that doesn't have A/C so not too concerned with the noise it makes as some describe...got a headset on anyways.
3,Not Quite Right,"While this fan can really move the air, seriously, you just can't stand the noise! It's dangerous if you're driving- you can't hear shouts or warnings, or even your music!! Sorry, Guys-it was a good idea!"
3,Good if you need it.,"I purchased this fan because I am a Corrections Officer and am assigned to a vehicle without air conditioning. It's not an A/C, but it beats having no air movement at all. I like that it has a long cord, positionable head, strong clip (it hasn't fallen yet - I keep it on the visor) and a dial speed control. Yes, it is noisy when on high, but, consider your needs. I like it and recommend it."
5,"ROADPRO 12V "" TORNADO FAN""","ROADPRO 12V TORNADO FAN,.. IS A SUPER WELL MADE QUALITY FAN IT THIS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR MY TRUCK I GIVE THIS FAN 100% GOOD REVIEWTHANKSFRANCISCO"
5,Funtastic Fan,"Fan is excellent , the noise level is not bad at all , it has a speed control button so you can really adjust the fan speed. I like the fact that this fan doesn't look like a fan , it looks more like a radar gun somewhat."
2,Noisy and vibrates,"Bought fan at road stop. At low and higher settings the fan is noisy. The motor makes its own unique noise at low speed, the fan is not centered/balanced & makes noise, and it is very noisy at high speed. speed controller doesn't seem to always work."
4,Tornado fan,Very strong fanAlso very very loudIt drowns out music playingAnd on a very hot day it blew my fuse for the car lighter
2,LOUD and LAME,Wouldn't recommend. Way too loud and doesn't really move much air. To get an understanding imagine a box fan on low would equal probably 2X with this on high but it is literally 10X louder. I don't like that the speed control is on the 12V plug either. The clip unit is strong though.
2,Fine if noise is not an issue,"If you want a fan that moves a lot of air in your waking hours and won't be bothered by some extra noise, this fan is great. However, if you want to sleep while it is on, you better be able to sleep through a hurricane. It was way too loud for us in my husband's truck sleeper."
3,alright...,"I bought this album in like...6th grade? anyway It was alright, 3 good songs, 5 decent ones, 3 filler. However, the fact of the matter is that this album is way too pop for actual enjoyment. After ""Welcome To The Fold"" (heaviest/best song on the entire album) you're basicly listening to what you hear on MTV 90% of the time. So to sum it up if you want to hear pop songs of the 90s (About 9 of the songs or so), then this is for you. If you want to listen to more heavier albums, download welcome to the fold and go look elsewhere."
4,Could have done without the ballads,"This cd has some really good songs, like ""It's Gonna Kill Me"" ""Welcome to the Fold"" ""The Best Things"" ""Captain Bligh"" etc. but ""Take a Picture is one I could have done without. BUT this is a very creative cd, and I think they did well to beat the sophomore jinx. Short Bus is hella better though."
3,Filter-Take a picture,I thought the words were very powerful and his voice went perfectly with the instruments. I personally loved the different types of drums they had in the background. It gave the song a more hip beat. The c.d. as a whole is good but there are a lot of same rythmic pattern (in the voice). I think he has a sexy voice.
3,Reznorphillia,"This band is an attempt to make NIN more pop. There is nothing deeper about these guys. Cliche and unimaginative (though well produced), Filter lacks the raw frission of who they are plagiarizing. I've seen them live, and it changed me from a hopeful fan to a disappointed former fan. (Whereas I've seen NIN live, and I'm still a fan.)"
3,They should just keep on releasing singles.,"This one is reminiscent of the last album. The first single is amazing, then you buy the cd and there's only 3 or 4 good songs. The rest blow. There's nothing better than good Filter---it beats good NIN. But medicre NIN is way better than mediocre Filter, and half of Filter's material is just that. Maybe if he just released his great stuff one single at a time a la Trip like I do, One---I mean those were just amazing friggin tunes! Having said that: Welcome to the Fold, Captain Bligh, Skinny, Take a picture, Best Things---all good. The rest----eh! But again, Filter's best compares with anyone! I just wish he could make an entire cd of his best!"
3,Picture carries this disc,"First off, ""Take A Picture"" is one of the best songs to come out since Smashing Pumpkins ""Mayonaise"". The rest of the disc is okay. You might be feeling the other songs more than I did."
5,great record,"this is a great record, even though Brian Liesegang is gone, Richard Patrick and the rest of the band still produced a great record. Top songs: ""Welcome to the Fold,"" ""Captain Bligh,"" ""The Best Things,"" ""Take A Picture,"" ""Skinny,"" ""I Will Lead You""Also, for people who already own this album, there is a hidden track at the end of ""Miss Blue,"" in which Richard Patrick talks a bit about some stuff."
4,Really a 3.5 rating out of 5,"Filter is another band of young men that I didn't even hear about in the music scene. I decided on a whim to buy this CD for a taste of 'Filter'. Really if I could, I would give this album 3.5/5. It's not what I expected. This band experiments with their rock sound incorporating pop, fusion techno, with splices of punk and pyschadelic grunge in their songs. It is a fairly long CD just over 70 mins. This is a 11 track CD with the last track going for a whopping 19 minutes. 'Title Of Record' is a CD that will appeal to alot of people but not pure rock enthusiasts. I enjoyed two songs immensly on this album and they were 'Take A Picture' as well as 'Miss Blue'. These two songs have been on TV ads and movies and soundtracks, they are fairly distinguishable. Its not a bad effort but it won't be a CD that I will play regularly at all."
5,"Two tracks OR Two videos, two tracks and three live tracks","You have two choices here, if you want just a normal Japanese release with two bonus tracks, go right ahead, BUT if you want to put an extra $10 for an extra bonus disc featuring three live tracks and music videos of Welcome To The Fold and Take A Picture in a CD Extra, then you should look at the other Japanese release of Title Of Record. Jarrassitol comes off of the original Crow Soundtrack and is sounds typical Filter from 1995 starting silent and building up into noise and cluttering drums. Can&#65533;t You Trip Like I Do, is the same hit from the Spawn Soundtrack, which is actually Crystal Method&#65533;s song, featuring Filter over it. This song is very electronic, and about seven minutes long it is a great song, but you should buy the Spawn soundtrack if you want to hear it. Otherwise, the CD itself is great, but you should go for the Japanese Import with the bonus disc."
3,How plain... the title explains it all,"Something is seriously wrong with this CD. All the songs are so well crafted and the lyrics are sharp. So why is it that I don't want to listen to it? I think it's cuz it's so unoriginal, it sounds like every other rock record that's coming out. That's what I think. There could be another reason though. It could be that they're playing them on the radio constantly too."
1,I WAITED FOUR YEARS FOR THIS?!,"""Short Bus"" was mind blowing, this is just awefull. The only good song on here is ""Welcome to the Fold"", and that isn't even that good. If Trent Rezner were dead, he'd be rolling over in his grave."
2,Not what I thought...,"I purchased the CD before the days of iTunes and other places where you could hear snippets of the tracks before buying the album. I had heard and enjoyed ""Take a Picture"" and ""Best Things"" before buying the CD. After a couple go-rounds of listening to it, and then, revisiting it, the CD was not what I had expected--not that bad, but, not my type of music. Too screamy and dull at times.So, I wouldn't say this is a bad record, just make sure you test it out before buying."
1,This is what I waited for?,"This is very weak. I thought Filter was dead, and it turns out I may have been right. I'm considering bailing on the Family Values Tour after hearing this.If you loved Short Bus avoid this."
1,Not on the same level as their first,"Where the first Filter album straddled genres and created music with feeling, this is regurgitated hard rock dreck nearly indistinguishable between songs. The first album was alternative crossed with a metal and industrial band, and more than style, had substance in its songs, but this album is pure vomit. Avoid. If you liked ""Short Bus"" try Godflesh ""Selfless."""
1,severely disappointed,"seems as if filter wrote this while half awake and on a hangover. this is, by far, the worst album in my cd collection. i bought this cd in hopes of a good, solid, hard rock album, but what i found was a very un melodic thoughtless album composed of whining and cursing. i don't under stand how a band like filter could put out such an ""album"" and get away with it. i'm severely disappointed."
2,Gets old fast.,"I bought this because it was on offer and I had liked Take A Picture. I got bored of it within a week. I can't recommend this, but I can recommend the albums 'also bought' ie The Fragile, There is Nothing Left to Lose, and The Science of Things. Oh, and how about that title - real clever!"
2,What happened to Filter???,"Usually it takes about 4 albums for a band like Filter to become stale and boring, they managed to do it in 2."
2,"Great to Listen to While Drunk, But Doesn't Make the Cut","The first time I heard Welcome To the Fold, the song sounded excellent because I was completely punch drunk. In its own right the song is about boozing, however, I listened to the rest of the album while completely sober the next day and wondered why Richard Patrick decided tone down the bands sound and make it more ""accessible"" to the masses. So he could sell more records obviously. This album just doesn't cut it, when Brian Leisgang was still in the band Filter had very hard and yet sophisticated sound that was showcased well on its debut album Short Bus. But with Brian gone, the new band members, including the new guitarist Geno Lenardo are nothing but Patrick's puppets to do with as he pleases."
3,Not a lot of growth since Short Bus,"If I hadn't been waiting for almost 4 years for the release of this record, I might be more impressed. A good album, but it lacks most of the character that made Short Bus a landmark recording. My greatest disappointment is the fact that the single of Welcome to the Fold release for radio play is SUBSTANTIALLY different than the track on the album; it plays a bit slower (spanning over 7 minutes) than the radio version, and loses a great deal of its power. All in all, a welcome addition to my collection, but far too long a wait for a non-monumental release."
2,"syrupy goo - sticky, messy, and nauseating","The first few times i listened to this cd i was mortified. I didn't listen to it for a long time and then decided that i might be too harsh in my judgment and put in my cd player again. The result: my stomach started doing somersaults. I noticed that most people think this record is the best thing since sliced bread, but to me its sheer torture, especially when i realize how much i loved the first album (even if its supposedly more immature - and by the way, when did selling out suddenly become mature?). I guess it's just one of those records that people either hate (that's me) or (more commonly) worship like a household deity."
2,"Don't be fooled by ""Take a Picture""","I bought this album after taking the advice of a friend and hearing ""Take a Picute"". I admit that I did not know much of Filter at the time. Don't be fooled by ""Take a Picture"", Filter is a ""ROCK"" BAND. I enjoy track numbers 6,7,10,11 and this reflects my music taste. If you like ""ROCK"", Filter is the band for you."
3,"""Take a Picture"" of a Dark,HardRocking,Weird CD","When I heard ""Take a Picture"" on the radio,I thought it was so Magical and Mellow,and I read this really happened to Richard Patrick.He woke up running around naked on a Airplane.I love the line after the soft sound,with the yealing,""HEY DAD,WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT YOUR SON NOW.""I wanted to hear more of this type of music,but its not in here.This is a Weird,Dark,Hard Rock record.""Cancer"" scares the hell about of me.It could be in a Steven King film,and the first time I heard the ending of ""The Best Things,"" I thought for sure my CD player was broke.Its like a bomb going off.I did enjoy Filter's CD for the most part,but the rest of the songs are nothing like the hit single,""Take a Picture."""
5,"Great, Great, Great",Oh man what can i say. I love this CD. Richard has changed so much since Short Bus. If you like Short Bus you will simply love this album. The only thing i wasn't expecting was the change in his voice. Its like listening to a teenager turn into a full grown adult. A true masterpiece.
5,Rocks me and I am in my 40s,"Not many cds come out where all the tracks are exceptional. This is one of them. I am sure that hardcore fans will think the band sold out, but what do you want them to do? Play to the same million or so fans, or are you fans enough that you would like for them to reach new audiences and become more successful. Excuse me as I have to go listen to this again for the millionth time."
2,If this is industrial then britney spears is a deathrocker,"What happened!?!?! Short Bus was a very interesting and compelling album that was both catchy and dark; this album is just catchy(and not in a good way). It's depressing to see a talented musician like Patrick (or maybe liesegang was the one with talent?) churn out mindless radio-friendly garbage, but hey-anything to make a buck, right? It seems that the person below me is rather confused as to what industrial music is; it's NOT Filter (or even NIN), it's bands like Front Line Assembly, Numb, and Cubanate, although i doubt anyone here has heard of them . . ."
4,filter's best album by far,"this is without a doubt filter's best album, and even tho everyone may not agree with me ""the best things"" i believe is the best song on this cd. Even so the rest of the cd is amazing as well. The songs do get a little worse as you get further into the cd but at worst they are still pretty good."
5,This album should be in the Top Ten of All Time,"This is one of the best records I have ever listened to. Its one of the first albums I actually listened to as a whole, without skipping tracks or having one or two favorite songs. I feel its one of the most undermined and underrated albums of 1999."
2,Not going to try and sell it back but...,"... I'm not so sure it was worth the $$$. It's nice and all, but I think that's the problem. I would suggest listening to some samples first."
5,Still one of the best,Filter is not my favorite band by a longshot - they're not even a band I like much but whatever.....this album was made perfectly - they really nailed it as for the seller of the item.....My CD arrived in perfect condition (old school bubble insulated brown envelope baby) and on time.
5,flawless,"i wish i knew how a band is capable of such amazing music. this is one of the best cds i have ever ever heard. buy this please, please."
2,"Not Like ""Take A Picture""","Evidently this band has been around for a while but the first I'd ever heard of them was with the single ""Take A Picture"" so I figured I would give this album a try. While the tracks may be good (I don't mean to bash the band) they are much heavier than what I was expecting or than I like. I thought a few songs on the album were all right (in addition to ""Take A Picture"") like ""Miss Blue"" and ""The Best Things"". Since I haven't heard other albums by this band I can't make a comparison but if you're looking to buy this album based on the single itself I'd suggest not getting this album.PS - The album should be stickered too for profanity."
1,"Ah-hum . . . ""Way go my airplane?""",I don't think any other song has made me feel more embarrassed for the singer. 'Nuff said.
3,"This is a good cd, though all the songs sound the same.","311 has a great sound and I love the band, but I must say that all the songs sound the same. But if you really like their ""original"" sound buy the CD. If you like one song you will love them all."
1,(Almost) Pure Crap,"This CD doesn't have many quality songs on here at all. Most of them are just the same corny crap you can hear from poppy crap rock bands like Filter. The only good poppy rock band is Everclear. There are 2 good songs on this CD. 2! I strongly don't recommend this.Favorite songs: Welcome to the Fold, Captain Bilge"
1,"Weak, dude ...","If you really enjoy Filter, Short Bus is for you. This album is total pop. It'd go nice next to a collection of Shakira and Britney Spears albums. This album is sooooooo weak. Weak! You have been warned."
3,Pretty Nice Stuff!,"Well i bought Title Of Record for the good single""The Best Things""which is a pretty cool song!And all thought i have to admit,i hate the song""Take A Picture""which was almost played to death on the radio and tv!Their are some pretty nice songs here besides those 2 singles like tracks 1,2,3 and especially track 7 which is a cool mellow out song!But over all,it's a nice album to own for any modern rock fan!Just not the best album,but nice!"
3,"Don't be misled by ""Take A Picture""","I don't necessarily reccomend this CD to those of you who are mainly attracted to ""Take A Picture."" This CD has some great songs, lead by ""Welcome to The Fold."" It's a good CD, but not for top forty-fans."
4,good follow up to short bus,"i think its just as good as short bus was, but the thing is, i borrowed a copy of this album, it was bought in brazil, but has no extra tracks, but that alright, i remember waiting for this album to come out when i was in 9th grade, and loving the loud guitars on the leadoff single. i thought it was so cool, i didnt like all the ""newbies"" buying the album, cause they heard take my picture on the radio, but oh well. i recommend borrowing it from somebody, or buying it in the bargain bin, cause it isnt essential stuff, but good stuff to listen to if you listen to nine inch nails or other stuff like that"
3,too mainstream friendly,"i've known about filter for a long time, through the demon knight ost which featured their best song, ""hey man nice shot"". i always liked the song, so i decided to get short bus, a good album. i bought title of records when it was released, knowing ""welcome to the fold"" and ""the best things"". i liked those songs, and i have to say they are the best on this album. ""take a picture"" for an instance is very radio friendly, using a catchy pop melody. there are much worse songs on here i.e. ""miss blue"" & ""i'm not the only one"" (those songs make me want to [hurt] someone, cause they are so utterly ...). altogether this can be classified as well, pop with some metal guitars and danceable beats (""best things"" is a real good club song). not a bad cd, will be enjoyed by nin/manson fans. i personally prefer some real industrial/metal like ministry"
4,Will Not Dissapoint,"I bought this cd about 4 weeks ago. I threw it my cd player thinking it was going to be one of those cds that you just bought for a few of the songs. I was impressed. Not only with the songs I previously liked (welcome to the fold and take a picture), but the rest of the cd was great too! I recommend it for anyone that is looking for a quality cd to get yet has no clue what they want."
5,Filter still rulz,"Who are all these people who are knocking Filter? I thought this CD was awsome. ""Welcome to the Fold"" is catchy and hard rocking tune to listen to . I can't wait to see this band in Family Values '99 they will probably be one of the best bands on the tour. Buy the CD, you may be disappointed if you are not a Filter Fan, but if you are I think you will like it."
5,thanks Rich and boys,"Like most of you, I have been itching for a new filter album for a while. This album is not what I expected but is a breathe of fresh air. After listening to it a few times my love for it grows stronger. There are no empty lyrics, unlike most of todays garbage, and the instrumentals are amazing. My favorites include ""Take a Picture""(INSTANT HIT),""Captain Bligh"", and ""I'm not the only one"". Give this album time, it will consume you."
2,anemic,the sophomore album falls deeply beneath my expectation. on the first album the band distinguished and differentiated itself with the great energy radiating from each song. i'm sorry to admitt that i can't sense that anymore. i'm throwing a second star in appreciation for the improved melodies.
4,Finally success,"Finally Filter's new c.d. is out and its not disapointing. Their old c.d., Short Bus, lacked the variety that this c.d. has. And this c.d. still has the heavy metal numbers that those of you who bought Short Bus got it for. My advice, Filters, ""Title of Record"" is a definite must have."
5,Filter's edge has not died,"I have been a long time fan and was waiting the arrival of this album. I was not disapointed and it is probably one of the best cd's i've ever bought. The best songs are Capatin Bligh, Take a Picture, Cancer, and I Will Lead You. Buy it today, and you won't be let down."
5,Wow!,"I just wanted to say that this CD is fantastic and I feel great everytime I listen to it. My favourite songs are ""Take a picture"", ""Welcome to the fold"" and ""It`s gonna kill me"". So go check it out"
4,"An intense, emotional album.","I'll admit that when Short Bus was released I bought it mostly for Hey Man, Nice Shot, but a year later I was still listening to it repeatedly. Richard Patrick seems very talented at touching on subjects like isolation, loss, regret, bitterness etc. without sounding like a spoiled generation x-er. (ie. Pearl Jam, Bush etc.) Every song on this album has it's moments much like short bus did. Highlights include: The best things, take a picture, and welcome to the fold. Solid, unique and touching throughout, I really can't recommend this cd enough."
5,This CD sends chills down my spine!!!,"I'm not gonna bore you with all my thoughts. I will just say, if your reading this review, YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!!"
5,"One Word Descrebes it, WOW","Filter's follow up album Title of Record is really great. It has fast beats, heavy guitar, and bad ass singing by Richard Patrick. If you loved Short Bus you'll defenitely like this one."
3,an observation from an older guy...,"as if 27 is older, but anyway...is it me or does ""Take A Picture"" sound like a Janes Addiction song? Doesn't really matter, how things go in cycles, the song is catchy."
2,About Neil,"I latch on to anything new that's relevant to Neil, but this DVD covered a bunch of Blow-Hards discussing Neil. Neil was not involved at all...a few concert pictures, nothing we haven't seen before.This dude liked Neil, This dude did't ""get"" Neil...too much discussion, not enough Neil!"
2,Too Strong!,This colonge is way too strong and it seems old. I'm not sure but what I have smelled on other men smells nothing like this one does. It just seems like it is outdated or old.
1,"""POOR QUALITY""-LENMAR SBT22 CAMCORDER BATTERY","""BUYER BEWARE"" I purchased two of these Lenmar batteries now and both times they arrived broken during shipping. It's NOT the fault of the shipping company... the problem occurred because of a cheaply made plastic casing the Lenmar Battery Company uses, the plastic casing warps when it get warm, then the casing seal cracks. Very disappointed with the quality.On a scale of 1-10 (-1)=Poor Quality Item. I returned them both.Don't even bother ordering."
3,BEWARE - This pulley may not be the right one to replace your idler pulley!,"I purchased this to replace the idler pulley on my 2001 Ford Ranger (3 Liter, V-6), however, it is a significantly smaller pulley in diameter to the factory idler pulley, and is not the correct replacement. Looks like it is a fine replacement for the tensioner pulley, but if you're replacing your idler pulley, beware!"
3,Try this one out!,"Well, I've heard work from this author and production company before. I really like the way that the music sounds. The melodies and harmonies meld in a special way. However, I think that some of the singing is a little over done for what the songs are trying to say. Despite that, I would recommend people to listen to the CD just the same. Lowdermilk is a genious at a very young age."
5,A GREAT biography about a GREAT man,"This book rested on my bookshelf for about two months after I received it from Amazon. Frankly, I found 700-plus pages a little daunting. But having read The Supreme Commander - Stephen Ambrose's masterful book on Ike's war years, this seemed a natural follow-up. It was especially alluring because Ike so admired Marshall. As I deem Ike a genuine hero, it was natural to be interested in his hero.Well, I'm glad I tackled it! I rank it alongside biographical masterpieces like Edmund Morris's two-volume biography of Teddy Roosevelt and Ron Chernow's biography of Rockefeller. Simply put, this is one of the best books I've ever read.For anyone interested in the WWII era, or generally the history of America in the first half of the 20th century, this is MUST reading.James B. HagertyCincinnati Ohio"
4,For me,I bought this to add to my library. I haven't read it yet but it has received very good reviews and I look forward to reading it while on vacation.
1,Oversampled,"It just surprises me when it really comes toward songs by Beyonce. At first, she seemed to be alright to listen to, but she seems to really be turning into another one of those manufactured rip-offs. Her latest song, Naughty Girl, is not really an enjoyable song. I really thought that it just wasn't anything exciting or uplifting to enjoy. The song at the very beginning samples Donna Summer's Love To Love You Baby. The song just simply is the beginning of her overexposure. I think it has to be one of the worst songs I've ever heard right now. As for her, I just hope she reunites with Destiny's Child soon. She just seems to be lost right now."
3,donna summer did it better,it trips me out hewaring new acts copy old school lyrics beyonce's hot right now and this was'nt all that bad she can't funk with donna summer though.
2,Terrible,I always hated her but surprisingly I have liked her latest material this is the Beyonce of old crap she is really not that good and I was always a hater of Destinys Child.Lyrics 2/10 Production 5/10 Overall 3.5/10
2,beware,"I ordered this used and it's NOT the same single described by 'bigboy010205', the other reviewer on here....the one I got only has 2 songs, the regular version of 'Naughty Girl' and 'Everything I Do'. Don't get me wrong it's a good song but this is the 2nd time I've bought the single looking for the dance mix....still no luck I'm about to give up."
3,donna summer would be ptoud maybe,"beyonce used her old chant love to love you baby i prefer donna summer's version where she have orgasms on record to this, this isn't bad but i heard naughtier songs but hey whatever sells."
1,Nasty Girl,"I initially wasn't going to review this song (that's how awful it was) but I recently heard Destiny's Child's song ""Nasty Girl"". For those not familiar with it, the chorus is:Nasty put some clothes on, you lookin' stankNasty what's your problem, you should be ashamedHard for women like me who try to have some intergrityYou make it hard for girls like myself who respect themselvesAnd have dignityYou nasty girl, you nasty, you trashyYou classless girl, you sleazy, you freakyN-A-S-T-Y ya nasty, F-R-E-A-K ya freakyGirl where's your P-R-I-D-E, put some clothes onNasty put some clothes on, I told yaDon't walk out your house without no clothes on, I told yaHowever, the hypocrisy and awful lyrics have nothing to do with my 1-star rating. That is directed straight at Beyonce's shrill falsetto. It gave me a headache througout the entire song."
3,NOT Calderone Quayle Club Mix,"These versions are OK, but if you are looking for the Outstanding Remix of Calderone Quayle Club Mix (on the Top Ten Dance Club Chart of Billboard this week), keep looking for the other version."
4,Durable,"Ordered this for my 50 lbs African basenji mix. He LOVES to chew and can put away a 10 in rawhide in under 45 minutes. He instantly loved this toy. Has left lots of teeth marks on it and seems to enjoy the flavor. A little disappointed to read in tiny fine print that this toy should ""NEVER"" be given to a dog with permenent teeth (for puppies only). I would be curious to know how a puppy could need a toy sized 'giant'."
5,"Nylabone ring, yeah!","Been looking for this ring that my border collie/blue heeler LOVES for a while after my feed store ran out and am so glad I found it. As soon as I opened it she took it and proceeded to play and chew. Got one for my other dog and she has absolutely no interest. Took it and dropped it. The pup who likes it often holds it over her face and walks around with it, so cute. It will last her a good couple of months before she chews through it and it becomes too gnarly to play with. Great made in the USA toy. Don't stop making these, Nylabone."
5,Still in one piece,Bought it for my Dogo Argentino and she shreds everything. So far this has out lasted her kong. I am amazed
4,Loved it!,My dog can destroy any toy in about 5 minutes. Shes a lab and a big chewer but she has yet to even come close to destroying this toy and it's been about 3 weeks. The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 is just because she doesn't play with it as much as her Kong
4,Chew toy for our pitty,This is great for our chewer. He loves it. Some chew toys has tips at the end and sometimes makes his mouth bleed after chewing this toy does not because it is round.
4,Novelty Shape,"Got this for a bit of difference with a shape for my dog. He appears to like the shape, and it makes it easy for him to grip and chew. Appears to be holding up well."
3,Great strong toy - my dogs hate it though,"This is a great strong and sturdy toy that my dogs would not easily be able to destroy. However, because it's a circle and it's so hard to grip with paws, they never really touched it. I guess they just got fed up with it or bored of it because it can't really be ""played"" with. Just something to consider - still a really great and sturdy toy though!"
5,My Pitbull loves it!,My American Staffordshire(aka pitbull) is just over 1 years old and needs some pretty tough toys. She loves this toy! This is the 3rd Nylabone toy she has and she really hasn't done much damage to any of them but I can tell this one by far is her favorite.
5,Great for Super-chewers,"I have a 60 lbs Siberian Husky who chews like a maniac. I've spend hundreds on dog toys and the strongest nylabones. This works great and has kept my husky entertained for hours. He has yet to chew any ""dangerous"" chunks from this thing so it gets full stars for doing what it says it does."
3,"Good quality, dog isn't interested","This has the great Nylabone quality, but my dog is not interested in it. He loves his Nylabone bones, but this one seems difficult for him to keep in place to chew. He tries to put his paw through the ring to hold it in place, but it falls over so he just leaves it and looks for something else to chew. I think it's just my dog's preference, but I would consider the type of toys/chews your dog likes before buying this one since it's not a typical shape."
4,Great variation,This bone is great! We have a 2 year old that loves to tug with our dogs. This bone is so much better than the normal Nylabones. It also seems easier for the dogs to hold. One negative: it isn't very thick so they can chew through it quicker than some of the others.
2,"may be good for light chewers, not powerful.","the package shows for ""powerful"" chewers. Well my 20 lb 1 yr old corgi chews these things right up. They get chewed up so much and so fast that they end up with sharp edges and sometimes i find blood on it from my dog's gums....and this is only after 1 week or so.If you have a 'powerful' chewer, go for Deer Antlers. They last SO SO SO long and my corgi loves them. I guess nothing beats mother nature."
3,not so sure about this one.,"I have an 8 month old hyperactive, constantly chewing puppy. He tends to forget about this toy a lot, it doesn't keep his attention. I have to remind him that it is in his toy bin but he only chews on it for a few minutes every few days. It is a hard toy and has no fun shape. He would probably love it if it was a different color and something other than just a ring."
1,Nylabone Dura Chew Ring,"My dogs want nothing to do with this ring. Unfortunately, I've found it to be a waste of money. Better luck to others!"
4,Super Toy,"I really like this toy for my yellow lab puppy. He really enjoys corners, and if he can find one, he will demolish it. Regularly shaped Nylabones last around a month. This ring has been super fun! He likes to play with it a lot because it's round, so he can stick his paw in to secure it, and then chew. It's very sturdy, but there is another version of it called the ""Gumabone"" for younger pups. I wouldn't go over 5mos with Gumabone products. This toy is really fun for dogs, almost indestructable, it's super!"
3,so far nothing...,"Just got it today. Opened it up, she sniffed it and shrugged it off. She normally chews but I suppose prefers hard rubber as opposed to a hard plastic material such as this. Maybe in time. We'll see."
3,LOST HISTORICAL DOCUMENT FOUND,"Impossible to ""star"", this odd collection does forsee rock from a primordial swamp. Despite the laughable ""Hee-Haw"" theme, one does sense better things to come. Very strange. I would recommend it to rock historians building an archive. Very strange."
4,This is a useful lighting accessory.,"I've had big panels around the studio for years and I think they make nice light by dint of their size. This unit is sturdy, quick to set up and does the job. It's not very complicated so neither is this review. I use it with white translucent fabric."
5,A Wonderful Book,"This is one of those books you'll tell everyone you know about. I've given away probably a dozen copies to friends and family. Everyone loves it, both men and women. But the best testament I've heard so far was from my sister, who after reading it herself, read it allowed to her husband on their honeymoon. He enjoyed it so much, they've started a tradition of reading aloud to each other.The story, the characters, the rhythm of language all blend together in a beautiful message of hope. This is a wonderful book, which I highly recommend. For myself, I know I'll end up reading it over and over again."
5,A Beautiful Read,"Based on the jacket cover description, I purchased this book to take on a vacation... I read it in about 2 days! I was so pleased with the quality of the writing. Ms. Ellis is truly a talented writer who writes from the heart (she, herself, lost her husband in a war) and has the skill of keeping you so engrossed that you can't put the book down. When I returned from my vacation, I searched for other books by Ms. Ellis and was disappointed that there were no others at that time. I have recently, however, discovered ""The Photograph"", bought it immediately, and should have it finished in a couple of days! Keep up the outstanding quality, Ms. Ellis... I will keep buying!"
2,Poor writing ability meets compelling characters,"From the start, the writer's technique disturbed me. Most stores from the Civil War era are written in a voice that matches the dialects of the time and region. This book felt like it was written by a teenage girl in modern-day society. The story would move too quickly for comfort through interesting things and then suddenly slowed down to dwell on less intriguing items. The characters were compelling but so many loose ends were left unresolved that it was hard to really understand how the ending came to pass. Also, I found myself wanting to fact-check several times, leading me to question the historical accuracy of the writer."
4,"This title didn't grab me right away, but the story was GREAT!","When I was at the library, I thought this was a different book.When I started to read it, the pages drew me in immediately.This book is about three sisters who live on a plantation inVirginia during and after the Civil War. Two of the three sisters were married and their husbands died for the ""cause""They have this idea to make a wedding dress for their younger sister who has no propects of getting married. During thiseffort, they involved other people who have no idea what is happening to them. In a twist of the story, the one unsuspectingsoldier who helps them out, falls in love with the oldest sister and not the one who they are making the dress for.The story is interesting and is just a nice read for those who love historical fiction.Ellen"
2,NOBODY GETS HURT AND NOBODY GETS HOT,"If you've seen any serious competition tapes you will call this fluff. 2 stars for good picture quality and pretty girls. But nobody breaks a fingernail here. Mostly they tug on each other till they go to their knees and then gently recline to the floor and roll around a bit. WWF women are sexier IN their outfits. The director should have watched them to get an idea about holds the girls could have used and just held. No holds last more than a few seconds, they seem to be afraid to make it sexy. First 30 min wasted on silly strip routines. 4 girl, 2 team thing. Wrestling and less interesting boxing. Truth be told."
4,Manual Tracking Adjustment feature,"Model 9450 still gives the user the capability to use manual tracking adjustment on top of automactic tracking. That was the most important feature I was looking for. Most other brand VCRs shows ""jumping"" pictures on old EP tapes. 9450 is truely exceptional within its price range."
2,But will it last?,We have a 9450 and have enjoyed it so far. However it is barely out of warranty and just pooped out.
2,Didn't meet my standards,"I bought the PV-9450 looking for a cheap 4-Head Hi-Fi VCR. The picture on this VCR was very good, however the Hi-Fi sound had some noticable interferance (Static etc.). The VCR also had a loud ticking noise, this would happen when watching video, recording and just when the VCR was on. This VCR also does not have a timer on the unit, this is a feature I like. I decided to return it, the PV-9450 is fine, but didnt meet my standards :/."
5,"It's a combination of Excellent Quality, Value, and Price.","My husband and I are completely satisfied with this VCR! By the way, Wal-Mart charges more on their website for exactly the same model (Panasonic PV-9450)."
3,Somewhat interesting,"After blowing through ""Brain Storm"" it was apparent that this was not the book I thought it was. There were some useful bullet points, and interviews. However, I was looking for something with a little more substance.I wanted a more mathematical approach to brainstorming as opposed to just coming up with lots and lots of ideas and then picking which ones you like. I thought that brainstorming would be a little more guided than just coming up with tons of ideas. The structure of brainstorming needs to guide the person or group so that the byproduct of their discussions, pictures, etc. is the idea...not just coming up with ideas and hoping that you somehow came across the correct one."
2,Poorly written,"This was just poorly written. Alternatively cliched and implausible. At times boring, at other times disgusting. Some interesting passages, but few and far between. Just plain bad."
1,Abuse of the Justice System,"Living in the Brighton - Howell area, were Stan Latreille resides. I find it difficut to see where creative imagination was used in this attempt at a fiction novel. Golf Club Road as well as other visual areas described are an attempt to regurgitate a description of the city of Howell, Michigan. However, his description of the area being a group of inbred, ruthless, body of people which exploits then abuses women and children is not fiction, but reality, showing in them not the best, but the worse humans offer in egocentric, greedy, individuals who are not only in law, but feel they are above the law. 92 cents is far more than anyone should ever pay for this sickening story written to exploit."
5,"Excellent for professionals and families. A ""must read before remarriage""!!!","This book is fantastic. I am a licensed marriage and family therapist and am in a blended family. Dr. Bray, through his research, hit on every troublesome topic known to stepfather families, discussed them thoroughly and then made accurate, wise suggestions for conquering them. His writing style is great for laypersons and refreshing for professionals. So many self-help books are like eating sand but I read this book in less than one day. If you are considering DATING AFTER DIVORCE, read this book. If you are engaged to remarry, you and your future spouse need to read this book. It will save you GREAT heatache. Do NOT enter into a remarriage without educating yourself as to what you are getting yourself and your children into!"
4,Sadie Shapiro Match-maker,"Sadie Shapiro's Knitting Book was assigned reading in my high school class. We all enjoyed Sadie and no, the book isn't about knitting. I was very happy to be able to use the Amazon system to locate this and other Sadie books. Good reading, pleasant, funny and oddly enough not horrendously out-dated.The way the story is written you can easily imagine Sadie speaking in her Jewish accent. I teach now and some of the kids at school have been reading these books. The get an exposure to Sadie's culture and age group. It's been a good addition to my collection."
4,"My dog loves these toys, but...","I was a little disappointed when I opened this box and found 2 of the 3 squeakers did not work and the one that did was very weak and hard to squeeze. My dog was with me when I opened it and so excited so I had to give it to him, but wish they test the toys before sending them out."
4,A Decent Dog Toy,"My dog can rip through most stuffed toys in a day or two. I have been using this ultimate boomerang with him for about a month and while he has ripped off some of the stitching, it's condition isn't that bad yet. And my dog does seem to enjoy fetching and catching the boomerang. I have no illusion that this dog toy will last forever. If the dog toy companies made toys that lasted forever they would go out of business. But it is a notch tougher than most of the dog toys out there and my dog seems to have a good time with it. The price here on Amazon is less than what I paid for it in the pet store so if you want a dog toy with slightly better than avaerage durability it might be worth buying it here."
5,"An first hand, inside look into ee cummings","These six ""nonlectures"" give more insight into ee cummings than anything else I've ever read about or by him (except, perhaps, for the Enormous Room, also a fantastic book). He talks about his family, his beliefs, and colors it all with true cummings style. It's delightful."
4,Just a bit of a gap around a leviton 3 way rocker switch,"I got a couple of these to go with two Leviton 3 way rocker switches I purchased for my laundry / mud room. Switches went in great, and these matched the color perfectly, as expected.Screws matched up fine, nice and snug fit on the wall, but I was a little surprised to see a slight gap around the outer edge of the Leviton switch and the inner edge of this plate. They just don't QUITE have the size right.Not so noticeable as it leaps out at you as soon as you walk in the room, but definitely there when you look for it, unlike the other rocker switch / plate combinations I've used before.Nice solid piece, strong but flexible so you don't feel like the moment you tighten that screw 1/4 turn too much you will crack it. Just wish it fit a little better."
5,These are good switchplates,These are well made and do the job. No problem with installation. Price was very good. All around good product.
2,Comes broken and breaks easily,These just are cheaply manufactured. There is no other way to put it. I like the Leviton brand but be careful with these if you do decide to purchase.
2,Had to trash the plate,"I know this plate was under $2 at the time so I'm not terribly disappointed that the plate cracked in the middle while screwing it in. I went around the corner, purchased another plate for $1 that stated ""crack proof"" and it did the job. It really was crack proof and looks great on the wall."
3,acceptable quality,"The wallplates are OK and do their job, however you would expect a little bit more quality for the price"
5,Its a wall cover,"Does its job nicely, just bear in mind that it is standard size, if it is replacing a jumbo or mid jumbo, as it was in my case, it will leave a square of unpainted ugliness around it."
5,Solid,"I didn't know what this was really when I bought the new light switch. Turned out, I didn't need this and if you're replacing a dual switch, you most likely have this installed. It is a good item so if you need one, kI would recommend this particular item."
1,A very horrible sequel for Demonic Toys!!!,"Lisen!!! don't even watch this [stuff]!Because:1- Is very short (Less than one hour).2- Jude's death was VERY STUPID.3- The voice of OPPSY DAISY was changed and it was very bad acted.4- The story was extremly cheap than the first one.P.S: Just don't watch it!!!!!!!!Sayonnara,adios,goodbye"
2,SEQUEL TO THREE MOVIES,"This movie picks up about where Demonic Toys left off. A hobo (R.C. Bates) spills his blood in the same warehouse and re-animates the toys destroyed in the last film. Not only is there an alien doll man (Tim Thomerson), but now there is a doll girl (Melissa Behr) as Nurse Ginger. She originates from a third movie, ""Bad Channels."" Don't worry. If you haven't seen any of the three prequels to this film, they show you plenty of excepts to catch you up to date.Judith (Tracy Scoggins) for some reason believes a 12 inch man can defeat a 12 inch doll easier than a 6 foot person. The demonic toys are aided by security guard and former Ewok, Phil Fondacaro. In a role reversal, toys want to have sex with a woman. It is short and it is what it is. You might be better off just watching the prequels knowing it gets worse. The toys are not as funny and clever as in the first film.F-bomb, sex, no nudity."
1,Don't buy on VHS,"Mine broke on the first day I recevied it, it was a VHS tape that could have been the problem but also the Tape was new, still in it's srienk wrapper and spanking brand new I placed it in my VCR and the film started blink black then it when back to the movie momentarally and then a few hours later I decide to take it out out the VCR and it pulls the tape from the film up out of it! It could have been my VCR that could needed some cleaning but there is no reason for it to brake the way it did. It really sucked so hard I wouldn't buy it on VHS if you want to purchase it in stead I'd would get it on DVD plus you get it the original doll and and the first demonic toys can't beat it plus it's on dvd and it looks a whole lot crearer than the VHS Version"
5,Question Anyone?,"I read the reviews and got the CD today, I loved it from the first listen. But I have one small question, in the end (4:52)of the 11th track ""Wasted Time"" my CD just jumps to the next track without finishing the song. Is this the way it was intended to be? Does anyone else find this a little odd?"
2,Just a few months to wait...,"I do belong to the early fans of Me'shell since her track on the Red+Hot+Cool CD. I was very sad of hearing the ""Bitter"" CD that she may have changed style...but NO! I just saw her in concert last week in London and SHE'S ALIVE! We had plenty of soft and funky song with plenty of electric guitars, rhodes piano, slap bass and groovy drums, jazz solos, velvet ambiances...just as in the first 2 albums. She performed 2 tracks that should be part of the forthcoming release. No date has been mentionned so far..."
3,"Beware! Not Like Her First 2, Very Funky Records","Gone are the funky breaks in the middle of the songs. Gone is the Dave Gamson produced in-the-pocket groove. Gone is the vibe you're used to. If you liked her first two records at all, this record still might not be for you. It's really acoustic-minded, which works fine for Tracey Chapman, but isn't what I go to MeShell for. WHile she's allowed to write, sing and say whatever she wants, I prefer my MeShell funky. She was one of the few people really bringing it to audiences as good as she did. This is her heart-break, Sade-impressionist album. A solid bit of work, but nowhere near as c9ool a vibe as her first 2 records."
1,THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!!,"Me'Shell must be experiencing some sort of deep emotional pain for it has seeped through into this cd. I am a true fan of her music, but this cd has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I certainly hope she feels better soon."
4,if u like music u will like meshell!!!!,"I HAPPEN TO RUN INTO THIS CD AT THE STORE NOT EVEN KNOWING SHE HAD A NEW CD OUT. ITS PRETTY GOOD. I HAVE HEARD ALL OF HER MUSIC SINCE HER 1ST CD(PLANTATION LULLABIES,MY FAVORITE ONE OF HER CD'S) AND ITS A DIFFERENT MOOD ON THIS CD A MORE BITTER, MELLOW DARK SIDE. BUT IT IS GOOD TO LSITEN TO AND RELAX. I RECOMMENEND THIS CD ITS PRETTTY GOOD OVERALL."
5,A genuis in our mist,This is possibly the best CD out there. Me'shell will steal your heart and soul with each of these songs. It's a shame that good music is frequently overlooked for skippily dressed barbie dolls who barely know the music scale. (read: Pussycat dolls)Highly Highly recommend.
5,A GREAT ARTIST!!!!!!!,"This cd is the incredible!! Meshell is a superior instrumentalist. And in an era where everybody is trying to find a way to pare down their music, whether it's from pressure from the record company to sell records or their own insecurities require they sell records, she puts out this cd that first of all deals with pain and anlienation (Which I guess she was feeling in her life at that time). The songs are about breaking up, abandonment, the whole nine. It's a very melancholy record. I applaud any artist in today's society who has the guts to represent any emotion other than happiness or juvenile angst! They have a fan for life in me."
4,alas...another sip of her soul to soothe our aching needs,Meshell's raw honesty mirrors the pains and fears of every person who has ever played and lost at being in love. Her album is definetely a new plate of sorrowful soul brought to the table and I'm slowly sipping this one to savour in the mouth of my soul. A must have for Me'shell fans ONLY. If you havn't heard the brutal truth as it's been told through her bass on previous albums...don't touch this one. She's an acquired taste and must be eaten slowly from beginning to end.
3,Different... but not Me'Shell,"Perhaps I'm being unfair or a little biased, but this mellow, bass-less, dreary, non-funky Me'shell is doing very little for me. On the one hand I can respect her artistic decision to venture away from the funky, bass-laden beats most of her diehard fans have come to love, but at the same time THAT was exactly what made her so darn talented and why I bought her stuff.Bitter is just that... bitter. The music, lyrics are all reflecting a meloncholy, loveworn young woman. It is done pretty well... but I spend half of the CD wondering: Did she misplace her guitar? Where's the bass?Needless to say, I won't be blasting this one often."
4,"I saw it coming ... somewhat sad, but I love her music!","I've always been the biggest MNO fan! I admire the poetry of this cd especially. Her music has always been about pleading for someone whose heart was out of reach ...""I've been waiting here for hours,"" ""just one kiss,"" ""let me have you,"" etc. Pining for someone you can't have is arousing only for so long; eventually you become ""Bitter."""
3,not as strong as the other,i think she is bad.very talented and what have you.but this album didn't have the spark of her other two records for me.but i have to give her credit for trying to do something different.still i look for an eye opening song from her.she is one of the few artist today that can make you go she did what? so i miss that edge.
4,Strong smooth stylizing from this nubian beauty,"As ever, Meshell doles a fresh sweet new album filled with mellow tracks. The song Satisfy is reminiscent of the type of tunes that you know with her past stuff. The backup singers are hauntingly strong and lovely. Take your time listening to this album... it is sure to become a favorite in anyones collection."
5,A classic for all time,Who would have thought that this artist -- so good but so different on her last 2 albums -- would release one of the great singer-songwriter albums ever. Heartbreaking and uplifitng in equal measures. Stunning arrangements and production. And just lovely singing and songwriting from this major artist. A record for adults with the ability to listen beyond pablum. Hooray!
4,Ndegeocello does it again,"For her third album, Meshell Ndegeocello mostly abandons the free-spirited funk in favor of an introspective, acoustic approach, and the results are stunning. The title track and ""Grace"" are two of the most beautiful recordings I have heard from anyone all year, and the Bill Withers-ish ""Loyalty"" is also a highlight. Easily one of the best albums of 1999. Meshell Ndegeocello deserves to be a superstar, but in a market saturated by calculated, shallow garbage like the Backstreet Boys and Broccoli...er, Britney Spears, there is no chance that Ndegeocello's brilliance will be heard by a wider audience. Too bad."
3,Unique Sound,Love this album Meshell is definitely a great& unique musician. The seller was quick and cd was in the shape they advertised.
3,It's Not Peace Beyond Passion,"I LOVED Peace Beyond Passion. It was one of my ""If you had to take 3 CD's on a desert island"" picks. I was very excited about her having a new one out. Bought it immediately. It's very good, but lacks the edge that Passion had, and I've always found that her edge was what I enjoyed most about her music. She still has more soul in her little finger than ALL the female singers out there, but I wish she'd get a little of, I don't know, the ""tough"" back."
4,"Deep, emotionally raw and beautifully arranged","Having become a fan of her amazingly smooth voice and driving bass from the first album, and more so through the second, this was a radical departure from those funky workouts. However, although there is a noticable absence of her bass, the emotional depth still shines through in some beautifully arranged pieces. My personal favourites were Bitter, Grace, Faithful and Wasted time. The mood is painfully melancholy though, so this is one to chill out, or do some thinking to. Definately a classic."
5,The rendered essence of exquisite vocal tonality & passion!!,"If you're a TRUE vocal enthusiast, then U-MUST add this piece of audio-art to your collection! Me'shell's lungs bleed PASSION with every spoken (and sung) syllable, her lips part to emit tonal radiance, warmth, longing, contemplation, ressurection, hope and lyrical simplicity wedged with emotional brilliance!! I've been playing this CD non-stop on my laptop since the Aug. 25th...if you have lived, lost and Loved ""LOVE""...THEN YOU WILL APPRECIATE ME'SHELL's renditions of the HEART....BUY IT AND BE ""CHANGED"" & ""COMFORTED"" for we are NOT alone in our relational struggles of ""Love""....at last, an artist & messenger who releases their PASSION enveloped by subtle musical accompaniment. U-Go-Gurl!!! Sing a message to my Heart, ANYTIME, COME RAIN, STORM OR SUNSHINE!!"
4,"soulful, bluesy album, but there's a problem with Track 11","I love Me'Shell, and am definitely feeling this album, but there's one problem that holds me up -- Wasted Time (Track 11) abruptly cuts off near the end. This song is one of the strongest cuts, and just as your really feeling it, it stops and 'Grace' starts -- you don't even get to hear the last line. Hopefully, this is a mistake in the run and the other copies will be error-free. Then I can give this CD my full blessing."
4,Bitter is not a hard pill to swallow,"Bitter is a hushed, evocative piece that continues to resonant with the listener well after the cd has shut up. The album pushes the artist far beyond the scope of her other works and left me yearning for more. Too often musical artists are influenced by prevailing trends, or stuck in the boundaries of previous musical forays, but Me'shell has escaped those pitfalls and soared on this album."
5,Walking Down That Road Of Love. . .Alone:A Look Into Bitter,"What can I say, sister Meshell Ndegeocello has done it again. From the very begining all the way into the end Bitter will take you on an emotional smoothed out ride, beyond love, romance, heartache, denial, and lust. For those who think they know themselves, Bitter will have you questioning your man/woman hood from top to bottom. It reaches into the reccesses of your mind and ask you the question. . .Why Me? Either way you go Bitter is the culmination of blood, sweat and tears. . .all produced under a heavy hearted Meshell Ndegeocello. Mad Love to her for this soul searching album."
5,First Time Buyer,"This is my first time buying anything by M', but it want be my last. This CD is one of the best CD's I have heard all year. It haunts me, I keep hearing these melodies in my head. She is a genius. I would have never thought I would even be turned on to her but she is by far something rare in the music industry an actual artist. Her CD is such a refreshing change that I was floored when I first heard it. Its one song in particular that has really been helping me through a difficult time. I hope that she will get the recognition that she deserves because this CD is a 5 star joint. Ms. Hill watch out because Bitter makes MISEDUCATION seems like High School, while Bitter is an advanced degree."
3,I MISS THE FUNK AND BASS,"I MISS THE FUNK AND BASS!! As a long time Me'shell fan, I can listen to Plantation Lullabies and Peace Beyond Passion anytime, but this is an album for a specific mood. I was longing for the bass guitar that Me'shell is none for, this album had more of a folk sound. After listening to the first few songs about love loss and dishonest lovers, I was waiting for more but it never came. But on the other hand, I can feel the love she has given to her lover and the pain returned. Me'shell I hope your relationships get better, for you and Alanis M. (Maverick labelmate) I MISS THE FUNK AND BASS."
3,Quite a departure,"I must admit I am a bit disappointed with Me'Shell's latest. I love the soft side of Me'Shell, but in smaller doses. On this album the mellow tunes take center stage and the funk is gone. The songs here are very subdued, lacking the power of her previous ballads like ""Make Me Wanna Holler"" and ""Ecclesiastes : Free My Heart.""I enjoyed the CD but it leaves me hungry for her unique funky hip-hop bass-thumping jams. There's none of that here.If you want to hear some nice mellow tunes featuring acoustic guitar and Me'Shell's sweet voice, you'll enjoy this CD. But if you crave the funky bass lines and sizzling musicianship that was prevalent on the first two albums, you will probably be disappointed."
4,Reflector Set with Snackets,"On my bike when I Night commute, I could not see due to the lack of a concentrated bright Bicycle light so I looked into the Reflector Set with Brackets after I fell 50 feet into an abandoned mine shaft (luckily no major injury, as it was a flooded mine."
3,Good one for a mountain bike,The set of reflectors are a good match for a mountain bike but do not come in handy for a road bike as they do not fit it any where. The quality of the reflectors are good enough.
2,Ok but not great,It arrived on time and it was ok but it will not fit my large handle bar on my Specialized mountain bike. Will need a special adaptor for large diameter bars including seat post.
1,Cheap Junk. Stripped Soft Weak Plastic,"The reflectors would be fine, but the mounts and hardware are pure junk. Mounts are tiny, and they are made of soft cheap weak plastic. I stripped one of the screws before it even got snug. The mounts didn't fit my bike, and the screws that hold on the wheel reflectors are made from soft nylon. I will leave the wheel reflectors on until they fall off, but the rest of the kit is going in the trash because I can't use it. I am really disappointed because I really only wanted a good rear reflector, and all I can use from the kit are the wheel reflectors.You can buy a decent light or some reflective tape for less than the price of this kit. Either of those would be a much better use of your cash."
2,Worth the cost IFF you are a bike expert,The package is worth the money if you are not new to biking or if you have a friend who isn't.I am new and I spent a couple of hours trying to figure how to mount the front and rear reflectors but just couldn't.End result: Returned the item (Sunlite 4 Piece Bicycle Reflector Set with Brackets).
2,not worth the money,This is just a bunch of common sense that most people would already know. It's of no need to a person (patient). It costs way too much to get.
4,Very interesting and informative.,This book will answer a lot of questions commonly asked by patients but not clearly understood. You will learn more about how to represent yourself with your physicians.
3,They sure dont make them like they used to....,"That phrase has become quite cliched, true, but it still very much applies to what passes as ""motion pictures"" these days. Roger Corman made pictures that were made primarily to entertain and make enough money to continue on to the next one. Economic and budgetary challenges were actually advantages, from my perspective and humble opinion, forcing Roger and his colleagues to get very creative in bringing their visions to reality. Some of it may even be considered as ""art"" today(Masque of the Red Death, anyone??). This is a fun and entertaining look back at Roger and his ""world"". I could have done without some of the pseudo-celebrity participants chosen for their insights, but I still enjoyed it overall. Worth a rental."
5,A Love Letter to Corman,"Roger Corman is known as the King of the B's and as the Schlockmaster. Although he has earned both titles his prolific output also garnered him an Oscar. This documentary features interviews with many of the people he helped get a start in the business,from Jack Nicholson to Martin Scorsese.It also features clips from some of his works i.e. Attach of the Crab Monsters a personal favorite and his Edgar Allen Poe films.I found it riveting to watch.Highly recommended."
4,He made the movies that people wanted to watch...,"Roger Corman is a product of a very bad system:he made the worst sci fi with as little taste as possible.He invented exploitations of different markets,like Blacks and Kung Fu. He gave a lot of youngpeople chances in movies they might not of had.When he did try to do something good in ""The Intruder"",he got good reviews and the film bombed(actually seemed to explode in human terms in the theater).He is just very good at making cheap production linefilms on a very low budget.This DVD is history that doesn't make Hollywood look very good."
5,Fascinating,"I love low budget movies, and have watched dozens of Corman productions. This documentary was a terrific overview of the man and his work. Packed with clips and interviews, including may with Corman himself, this is a widely entertaining look at a true film pioneer, while also being a fitting tribute to his work. Recommended."
4,"Great, but no mention of ""The St. Valentine's Day Massacre""?","This was a totally engrossing look back at the career of Roger Corman with great interviews of star actors and directors like Jack Nicholson, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, etc. My only complaint was the fact that there was no mention of ""The St. Valentine's Day Massacre"" starring Jason Robards and George Segal from 1967. I would have thought it would have been included because it was one of the few (if only) times Corman got the backing of a major studio. I've read that he came away from the experience feeling a sense of disgust at how willing the studio was to waste time and money during the production, compared to his streamlined approach, and he gladly went back to producing his own films through A.I.P. after this. Despite this omission, it's still a great documentary and I would highly recommend it."
3,Interesting but not nearly as in depth as I'd like...,"Trying to nail down the true extent of Roger Corman's influence on modern Hollywood is next to impossible, and a daunting task for any filmmakers. Having touched upon or helped launch so many careers, not to mention his own huge cannon of work, Corman is one of those names that has become synonymous with the art of movie-making. I was really hoping that this documentary would encapsulate his entire body of work, but unfortunately it tends towards his more recent direct-to-video fare and neglects to really examine large portions of his work, stuff like the Poe films with Vincent Price. If nothing else it's well shot and is a beginning to telling the larger story. Maybe we'll get a sequel that fills in the gaps?"
5,"The Man, The Legend!","The title says it all, Corman's World! The astounding mind that pumped out some of the most memorable low budget films. The visionary mind, that gave us many of the greatest actors, directors, etc. that the movie industry has ever seen. Just give this a look and learn what Corman's World is really like!"
4,KHive Review,"I think that the fan is a great even with the remote control, I mean how cool could that be?? Yeah it's an awesome toy and many kids I think would like it!"
2,Not sure it was worth it...,"It looks cool and shows your name in lights! The problem is it is VERY loud and doesn't really cool you off. It's a nice decoration though, as long as people are talking and you have loud music so you can't hear it. So it's good for parties, bad for rooms."
1,Very Small and Very Loud!!,"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift and it was a big disappointment. The fan is tiny, would not be able to be used to actually cool anyone off. It is also extremely loud, you cannot even hear yourself speak when it is on. There are no speed sets on this fan, just off and on. The light up feature is pretty neat, my daughter wanted to keep it just for that. It has a little remote and you can program the fan to say a short word or phrase, but it does have to be on to show the word. I would not waste my money on this item, it will not be used. My daughter liked it for a few minutes and now it just sits there in her room. Also, my ten year old niece received one of these and in trying to cut the package open herself, cut her hand open and needed six stiches! It is a very difficult package to open and should not be done be children!"
2,Mass choir,"The Mississippi Mass Choir quickly became a leading choir in the recording and musical performance industry. This album leads off with a song, which has created comments by many on this site, ""A City Built Four Square."" The song was recorded by Dorothy Love Coates and Her Singers in 1978 on the Savoy label, and the album has the same title, ""A City Built 4 Square."" The Mississippi Mass Choir follows this up-tempo track with the slower ""Emmanuel,"" which has a Christmas feel to it. The third track, ""The Lord Shall Reign,"" opens with the refrain from ""(Chorus) Hallelujah"" from Handel's ""Messiah."" An interesting track is ""Jesus, This Is Jim,"" with a story/sermon about a town drunk."
5,A Wonderful CD,"This CD is spectaculor. I love ""They Got the Word"" and ""He Can Fix What Is Broke."" The words to these songs touch my heart, I can really relate to them. I would recommend this CD to anyone. It's Great!"
4,good regular-duty wire,"Quite suitable for home stero applications. If you want earth-shaking bass, use these for the satellites and get some Monster Cable for the subwoofers."
2,Not what I expected at all.,I may have rated this cd really low because I was actually expecting different color songs. My daycare and one of the schools teaches color songs made by LeapFrog. They're very cute and easy for the kids to learn. The above cd by June was a group of kids singing with piano accompaniment. It was hard to hear the words like an echo in the background. I would recommend trying to find the one published by LeapFrog. I had a copy of the cd but my daughter at the time was two years old and erased the entire tape. I've called LeapFrog asking for the cd but it was only a special sent out to schools. I'm still looking for it though.
3,Ok,i bought this for a friend but then we saw it togeter and I think the filmaking is not that good.
4,Slipknot in High Definition!,"Upgrade version of their (sic)nesses DVD. This Blu-Ray is another good product from Eagle Rock Entertainment. The picture and sound have been improved with the DTS True-HD sound. Could be a little frustrating to those who have bought this a couple of years back, and to see that it's now in Blu-Ray."
2,A disappointment,"Okay, we have another DVD from Slipknot, my favorite heavy metal band. The first disc is nothing more than live scenes from their tour spliced together. A complete waste. The second disc contains three different elements. Footage of the shoot of one of their videos, which is only moderately interesting. The second part is the videos from their latest CD. Outside of Psychosocial, I don't think their last effort was very good. Lastly, there is concert footage from a festival in London. I would have liked this better if it had been concert footage from a show in a relatively small arena, it would have a better feel to it. The good thing is that it was professionally done, and you get some great songs that were not on Disasterpieces. If you have Disasterpieces, I don't know why you need this one, other than to see songs like ""Before I Forget"" live."
3,Should be Blue,"Completely agree; this should be 5.1 audio and 1080p Blu-ray. I'll buy it anyway - fact all ready pre-ordered directly from the label. But DVD is done, move on."
1,Dvd????,"Totally agree with R. Hernandez, this should be on Bluray or at the very least on Bluray aswell as dvd - atleast give us the option. I wont be buying this.Shame cuz if it had been on bluray it would have been a preorder for me"
1,This video only scratches the surface of menopause.,"Since my mother could not even remember the decade that she went through the change of life, she was of no help to me. However, a blood cousin of mine told me that it took her about 10 years to go through. And, it seems that way to me. I cannot emphasize enough about how the night sweats really can aggravate a person for the better part of 10 years! All I can recommend is to buy 7 gowns. My first year, at 39, I changed gowns three times in a night! Talk about being moody . . . But, if you are like me and have no mom to ask, this tape is for you!"
2,Not a reference book and not even a coffee table book!,"Do not expect the detail of a Jane's nor the wonderful photos you would usually expect from a coffee table book, so do not be deceived by the cover.This book is skimming over a BBC TV series. Whilst it has a few nice pictures, it is just that, a picture book, and not for the serious enthuiast. It consists of many frequently published photos and a few artist's renditions to fill up space.From the first truely famous British warship, the Mary Rose, to the HMS Victory, graduating to steel vessels, Dreadnoughts and to great battleships such as the Yamato and the American Iowa class ships; It only provides a brief Synopsis of a bygone era."
4,WAIT! Mel Waiters,"Mel is regular. It was good to get this cd. I was familiar with Hole In The Wall-the remix. And hits like Smaller The Club. But, Mel surprised me with songs like Material Things and Running Stop Lights. If you missed this one, my advice is for you to pick it up. You'll be pleasantly surprised."
5,MISSING MY BLUES,"I HAD LIVED IN LOUISANNA AND WHILE THERE MY HOUSE CAUGHT ON FIRE AND LOST EVERYTHING. I MOVED HERE TO MINNESOTA AND WANTED TO GET MY CD COLLECTION STARTED AGAIN. MAN HEARING MY MAN MEL WAITERS TOOK ME BACK TO CRAWFISH, GOOD FOLKS AND OOH THE MUSIC."
1,Terrible Quality!!!,I bought two of these and both of them broke within months of purchase. The buttons on the top have depressed into the clock and will not pop back up again. What a waste of money!
1,Bur another clock... ANY other clock!,"Alright. I admit that I am probably too picky, but honestly if a product tells me on the box that it sets itself automatically, then I expect to bring the darned thing home and have it do so as soon as I plug it in. Sadly, this is not what happens. I plug it in and it just flashes 12:00 at me like any other alarm clock. I have replace the batteries countless times, and read the instructions and web sites until I am cross-eyed. I have even returned it for another unit!!! (yes, it would appear that I am a glutton for punishment, but my wife likes it for some reason) This is the sort of product that makes people associate a company with really crummy products. I know *I* do...I bought an Emmerson Research clock radio a few years ago, and it actually *does* set itself, and I really think it is completely bullet proof. Go buy one of those, or *anything* but this piece of junk!"
2,RCA Clock Radio,I wanted to be sure the product was a RCA RP5420 AM/FM Clock Radio with 1.4-Inch Display withAuto Time Set.
1,Great if you don't mind the fact it won't display the time!,"For people that just hate to know the current time in the morning, this is the alarm clock for you! Because this alarm clock doesn't tell the time! Instead the radio station frequency constantly flashes on the screen and drifts from frequency to frequency several times a second. I read warnings about RCA alarm clocks online and I ignored them. Now I'm headed to the post office to return the thing. At least Amazon makes returns incredibly easy and refunds the money you paid for the postage. Amazon is a class-act."
1,Cheap Walmart Garbage,"Purchased the RCA model Rp5420 on 11/17/07. The first thing I noticed was that the thing did NOT automatically know what time it was, in spite of the claim on the box, and the batteries that came with it were DOA. I put new batteries in it, but noticed that no matter where in the house I plugged it in, there was a static type crackling noise constantly emitting from the speaker that would not shut off no matter what I did.I figured it would be my luck that it would catch fire or something went I left for work if I kept it, so I will be returning it today for something else."
1,Total disappointment,"I love the design of this alarm - it met all of my needs. When it arrived, it was so easy to set the time zone, radio stations and the alarm settings. The sound was great.I set it up in the bedroom at 3PM and when I went to bed at 11PM, it was dead. Nothing worked - no display, no radio, nothing. It was extremely hot on the left side of the unit and I could smell hot plastic. It had died some time after 3PM which is not much of a recommendation for the unit.If it had actually worked, I know I would have loved all of the features - the design is outstanding but the quality of the unit I received was very poor."
2,Interesting History -- Poorly Written,"As a native of the area and a graduate of Albertville High School I found the sections on the history of the area as well as the related photographs to be extremely interesting and informative. With that said, the author is clearly a zealot and he is unable to stay on topic for more than a paragraph or two with out some anachronism creeping in or jumping to some other related topic. The first 2/3 of the book is an interesting read and the photographs are both informative and hilarious. In the last 1/3 of the book the author's zeal really takes hold as he begins talking about football. At this point I lost interest, as it seems the author is really just another football obsessed fanatic that is all too common in the area these days. If you're going to read this book, do so only for the historical insight you can glean from it."
1,EXPIRATION DATE AROUND THE CORNER,"THE EXPERINTAION DATE OF THIS PRODUCT IS GETTING CLOSE, SO I WILL HAVE TO BUY MORE. IT EXPIRES BY NEXT MONTH. IT DOES NOT WORTH THE PRICE. IN OTHER WORDS YOU GET YOUR PRODUCT AND BY NEXT MONTH IS EXPIRED AND IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE USED IN 100 DAYS. FUAHH"
5,TEST STRIP REVIEW,Package was received in a timely manner. Product was as advertised. Expiration date was far enough out so that the product was useful.
1,sent back,the one poem that encouraged me to buy it as a small girft for friends was the only poem I liked!
2,SOUNDS LAME,"This toy sounds super lame, and pointless too! The fortunes are all clearly fake! You can ask the same question and it'll give you 2 diffrent answers! It looks cool though"
4,the drake series,I have all 7 Drake Series books. This is suppose to be the first one. Although not very long. It's a good story and a nice beginning to the series.
3,Ok read,I'm glad i got this book the way I did. It was an entertianing read but nothing I would have wanted to pay for. It was short and very fast. I'm not sure if I like her writing style yet. I'm reading another one of her series and its kind of the same style. Rushing into the plot with out getting into the backstory. Plus something I had no idea what was going on. which is not a good thing.
4,Magic in the Wind,"Christine Feehan is sometimes a difficult read for me, but I liked this book. I'll read more of her work."
4,Magic in the Wind,"I am not as happy with this series of books by Christine Feehan as I am with her ""Dark"" series featuring the Carpathian males. But I do enjoy this series about hyped-up by the military men who go out to find their preprogrammed mates who are hyped-up through private institution experiments. I own and have read all of these, so they are worth the money."
5,This is a GREAT short story!!,"When I find a great series, I just HAVE to read all of it - especially the one that starts the whole thing off. I spent $2.99 knowing full well that I was buying a short story and not a novel. Sure I would love it to be expanded to it's full potential, but as a short story, it was great!!"
3,Magic in the Wind,"The book was excellent, however, Amazon sold it to me for $4.99 and on the cover it was only $2.99. I am disappointed in Amazon."
2,Not impressed....,"I was not impressed with any of the Drake Sisters series. There was nothing there to keep me wanting to know more about the sisters. It didn't hold my attention. The ""magic"" was not enough to hold my attention.Another thing that bothered me is that everyone just took for granted that the sisters had their ""magical"" powers. They didn't try to hide it and it didn't bother anyone. No one questioned them. Maybe secrecy would have made the series more interesting.I was definitely not impressed. I'm hoping the Dark Series will be better, but from what I know about them, they seem like a ripoff of the Dark Hunter series by Sherrilyn Kenyon. I guess I'll have to see."
2,why so expensive?,"I love Christine Feehan, however, why is the book almost $100.00 used?! That is ridiculous!Dont be fooled into ordering this book, go to a used bookstore and buy it for about 99 cents. It is a quick read but not worth that!"
2,Just so-so,The book went too fast with not enough information on backgrounds. It was like it was an afterthought to write it. I have the read the rest of the series and they are fine. It was just this one.
2,An average first novel,"I bought this looking for a new author to read in this genre. Ms Feehan has a good number of books published with loyal fans, so I assumed that she was worth reading. This first novel was something of a let down as I could not really get attached to the characters, feel the emotions on the pages, nor get engrossed in the universe portrayed.I am willing to try another in the series because writers evolve and can grow into something spectacular. The book is worth trying at the ""teaser"" price that Amazon sells it for. Its a good strategy and I will take advantage of the introduction to this author to explore her works more thoroughly."
3,good but too short,I read the whole serie and this book is too short for a first book in a series of 6 books. The story is good but this is not the best of them all.Still you want to read it and know what is happening w/ Sarah
4,Good Story but SHORT,Great story - had read it in a combo book - Frustrating when you get a very thin book and was expecting a regular size one - GREAT STORY but as usual publishers making extra money by publishing different than original.
3,Dissappointing,"I love the Drake series. I started with Libby and decided to see what started the series, so bought Abigail and Sarah...I was so dissapointed in this book. It is so short and completely undeveloped. After reading Libby and Abigails stories which were amazing and well thoughtout with well developed characters, this one was a huge dissappointment. Maybe the problem was that I was going backwards and the series was not really thought out until Abigails book. I would skip this book and go straight to Abigails book (Oceans of Fire) instead. Really...you are not missing anything."
4,I love anything by C. Feehan,"I love anything by Christine Feehan; but her writings are not for children. I read somewhere her works described as housewife porn? Well, whatever you call it, it's a pleasant escape from the humdrum of everyday. It brings me the kind of romance our childhood fairy tales let me believe in. It's nice to dream. One big 'atta girl for Christine. Marcia AKA Topsy"
3,a great start for the Drake sisters.,Interesting read. Not as detailed as the following books. But liked the sisters coming together in this book too. Would have liked to see more details on the story itself. It just seemed to go too quick with not enough story.
4,Good overview,The story is a great overview of what the Drake sister stories are about and what is coming if you read the series. Sarah`s story is a great beginning of the magic and love you'll enjoy in the stories to come.
3,Interesting Start,"This is my first book by Christine Feehan and I was pleasantly surprised. I love books dealing with sisters and found this to be a promising start. My only complaint was since it was such a short story the ideas behind the Drake family (the gate, the prophecy, etc) couldn't be fleshed out, and the romance between the two characters seemed rushed and superficial. Hopefully the rest of the books show the interaction between the leading characters as evolving into a relationship rather than just constantly telling us how they love each other after so little time."
3,Great service.,"The book was in great shape. It arrived a little later than I expected, but it still came in a pretty timely fashion."
5,Magic In the wind,This is the first book I have read by this author and I just loved it. I am reading the next one in the series now. She is a very good author.
3,Just a little magical,"This short story introduces the Drake sisters and is the oldest sister, Sarah's story. Her prophecy, being the eldest, is that the padlocked gates surrounding their home will open for her destined love. Of course, we see him walk through it and he changes her life and that of her sisters.I'm intrigued by the talents and magic of these sisters and am looking forward to the series."
4,ENJOYABLE READ,"I enjoyed the characters and the blend of magic, romance and action in this book.....it was my first experience with this author and I'll give her another look, probably looking for more stories about the Drake sisters because I like the idea of 7 sisters, each different but with a bond of magic."
3,Feeling shorted,"If you have not read Christine Feehan's works before, she is a prolific novelist who does a successful job of mixing the two genres of romance and science fiction.This book is the first in the series about the seven magical Drake sisters. Feehan usually does an excellent job of character development, creating a plot that has many interesting twists and turns, and stories which include sizzling sex scenes (these scenes may be too racy for some). This book, however, left me with a feeling of being slightly disappointed. Magic Wind was only 101 pages long. I have read other novels in this series and I was disappointed that Sarah, the heroine of Magic Wind, did not get a full, well developed story as did the other characters in this series."
2,very disappointing,"First, I love Christine Feehan's work and I've read about everything she's published. I should have been tipped off by the price of the book, which is really a short story published in novel form (only 103 pages). While it was interesting to finally read Sarah's story (I've read the other Drake Sisters novels and really enjoyed them) this was like reading a summary of a novel or like watching a whole movie in fast forward. Where is the rest of the book? Christine's novels are usually so rich and full of texture and this is just the bones. I was hoping for a good read and I got cliff notes. I wish she'd rewrite it and flesh it out."
4,Good book!,"Thought I would try this series since I liked some of her other books. What can I say, I ended up buying all of them. Good read."
5,Magic wind,"good book , fast deliverywell written kept my attention all the way thru the book. I enjoyed the book and read it in one sitting."
4,Luv the Drake Sisters,"A great romantic book in a great witch series! Romantic and exciting with emotional love scenes. The men in this series are still alpha males but not quite as caveman-ish as the guys in her Carpathian series, and the women in this series are more powerful and modern, too."
5,Good product,I used this with a rental Ameda pump. It is easy to use and easy to clean. I give it a five-star rating.
3,Good but not the same.,"This worked for the purpose, but was not made of the same material of the parts that came with my actual pump. The measurements rubbed off easily. Works fine. For sanity purposes I would definitely recommend an extra set of parts when you are pumping a lot."
4,Great!,"Just what I needed to replace the ""personal"" parts on a used breast pump. Everything came sealed, and was WAY cheaper than other sites."
4,Nice plain Hat,Bought this to create an Ohio State Buckeyes Hat. No one would embroider it so I had tackle twill letters sewn on.
1,WHERE THE HECK ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS????????,"I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS ... I HAVE HAD A NIGHTMARE OF A TIME GETTING THIS ... TO WORK, AND THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE TERRIBLE. I GOT THIS ... FOR MY BIRTHDAY, IN JUNE, I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT, I'VE ONLY BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A FEW CDS. SOMETIMES IT WORKS, SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING WRONG. EVERYTIME I GET READY TO DESTROY THIS ""THING"" IT STARTS WORKING. IT'S SO SLOW! AND ...I COPY A CD, IT TELLS ME IT WORKED, THEN I PUT THE CD IN TO LISTEN TO IT AND ALL I GET IS A SCREEEEEEECH! I'M TELLIN YOU, IT BRINGS ME TO TEARS. DO NOT BRING THIS ... INTO YOUR HOME, ..."
3,"Sleek, fast, noisy drive","I have recently bought Predator 40x24x40 and so far I have made a couple of CDs. Reading other reviews posted here, I have to agree with anyone who complaint about the software, namely, ""HOT BURN"", that comes witht he product. The software sure is hot and great for burning coasters (4 so far and counting). The only amazing thing about the software is its speed...""Zzzzzzzz"". Oh not to mention I had so much fun restarting my Windows numerous times from burning image files on to CDs. Lovely. Anyway, it is a decent writer, noisy but still decent if and only if we ignore the existence of the software. Go Nero."
3,ALMOST GREAT!!!,"I am impressed with the drive itself; but,(a big but) the software is horrible!!! It slowed down, snail like transfer rate, did not recognize a USB 2.0 connection and froze my laptop.It basically took FOREVER!!!... BEWARE THE SOFTWARE STINKS."
1,If you buy Iomega products: 50/50 chance you'll get a lemon.,"There's just no in-between, and this drive is no exception.My drive will connect and be recognized by the computer, but it won't recognize any CDs that are put in, no matter what brand of CD. It doesn't matter what software you install, either - it's simply a hardware defect, and if you buy one of Iomega's cheap products, there's just about a 50/50 chance you'll get a broken one. If you're lucky, you'll get a unit that actually works fine.Take it from a network admin who has had to use many, many Iomega products over the years (with about half being unusable) - don't buy this product unless you're a compulsive gambler and you just have to take every chance."
1,"Cheap. cheap, cheap","This is the worst product Iomega has ever released and they in fact have dis-continued it because it is so terrible. The entire housing is cheap plastic, the USB 2.0 integrity is marginal at best and the entire unit is entirely unreliable. This is a very bad product."
1,IOMEGA muffed this one ZERO STARS!,"Bought the predator drive to go with a Toshiba Satellite laptop after making several coaster, put drive on desktop. Didn't work. Tried a second desktop. Still didn't work. IOMEGA sent two more drives and it still doesn't work. Unreliable, maybe one out of 10 tries makes a usable CD. Bought a TEAC. Built like a Battleship and works on all the computers. Has never made a Coaster. DON'T BUY IOMEGA UNLESS YOU WANT LOUSY SERVICE AND UNUSABLE CDs. Tech line kept saying things like IOMEGA stuff doesn't like Toshiba chip set. Well, the TEAC works find by Doing nothing more than plugging it up. Same PCs, Same software (Adaptec and NERO) Piece of junk - No more buying anything by IOMEGA"
4,Amazing Drive but [useless] software,"I bought this drive in the US a month or two ago and brought it home to India. This Drive works fine even with my 240 Volts domestic power supply. I burned my first CD using this drive and this one took just three and a half minutes to burn 600 MB of data. WOW!!! THAT's FAST!!!By the way, I bought a USB 2.0 PCI Card and I am getting a full 24X write speed. The software is ... useless. One Star less that perect for this reason. I grabbed a copy of Nero 5.5 and everything works absolutely fine. My suggestion...just buy this one if you want a CDRW drive."
2,Well at least it looks nice.....,"...even if it is no use at all with Windows 98. The installation instructions that come with the drive are not that helpful, and neither is the technical support I got when I went on the Iomega website looking for help. After a week of trying to get this to work I am now racking up expense getting our external IT support company at work to come in and help me TRY to sort this out.Avoid."
1,Warning Mac OS 9.2 and higher users,"I have a Mac running 9.2.1 and found out that the ""Hot Burn"" software from iomega is NOT compatible with 9.2.1. The iOmega corp. sent me a new firewire burner that was supposed to work with Mac iTunes or CD Burner software, but it does not. Not only that, they sent me the wrong power cord.DO NOT PURCHASE iOmega CD-RW products if you are using any Mac OS higher than 9.1!"
2,A little creepy,"The music background is very relaxing and helps you attain a semblance of meditation. But just as you get to that point where you are no longer aware of what is going on around you, Mr Andrews comes out of no where and begins talking in this very creepy voice. It brings you right out of your place of peace. Each time you get back into the zone he starts talking again. Skip this one, no help or relaxation comes from this tape."
2,Still in search of my spirit animal,"... The Spirit Animal is a Native American concept. I expected traditional Native music on the tape with some techniques to help me find my Guide Animal. The music is nothing more that the average run of the mill new age Yani music which I found to be quite inappropriate for the subject. The meditation side was also a disappointment. It was not a guiding technique but more like a feeble attempt at taking me on a journey. Maybe I would have had an easier time taking the journey if his voice didn't remind me of the narator from Michael Jacksons ""Thriller"" I felt like I was listening to a holloween tape the entire time. I'm sure many people out there will love this tape, I for one found it to be yet another new age scam, promising scerenity, and visions of bright lights, through meidtation and spiritual flight. Judging by his tape I think I am going to cancell the other books I purchased from his collection."
5,An exhaustive treatment of a controversial topic,"This book presents the facts - and lots of them - straight from the Vatican Archives as it examines the role of Pius XII and the Vatican during World War II. What emerges is a picture that is wholly at odds with what the popular myths that have been foisted upon us by Catholic-bashers operating under a pretense of objectivity and phony moral outrage. Pius XII is shown to be the hero he truly was - a holy man of God, doing the best that could be expected incredibly difficult circumstances."
3,"Fair excerpts, limited analysis","""Blet demonstrates that Puis XII's careful public statements denouncing anti-Semitism resulted not from cowardice, but from a firm belief that more pointed statements from him possessed the capacity to further inflame Nazi violence against Jews.""At what point did Pius figure out this prudence wasn't working, after Krystallnacht, the 1st million killed. Assuming prudence indicated Pius would say little about the murder of Jewish men, how about the children, women, the second and third million killed.Assuming arguendo, the murder of Jews was all right, how about the beatings and murder of Christians who had the misfortune to have Jewish heritage.Mind you, this could have been real easy for Pius. How about those who murder children will burn in hell. Ex-communicate a few Germans who murdered, mention that Jesus had Jewish ancestry.This defense of failure, Attila the Hun's morality was far higher than the German Reich, is unimpressive."
5,Pope Pius XII and the Churches involvement with Hitler and his Nazis,"It comes to no surprise at the Catholic churches history of meddling in Politics at the hands of innocent people. It's own Members included. The Church is steeped in Blood Guilt for the roll it's played not only in the death of the millions during WW2 But over the century's as well. This book only brings it closer into our modern day. I highly recommend this book as an educational indictment of why this Church, is the leader in adulterated Bible Teachings. They are what the Scriptures called Wolves in sheep's clothing"
5,Almost everything you need to know about Dean Koontz,"If you're looking for a reference work on Dean Koontz, look no further. Ms. Ramsland has written the biography that all others will be judged by. It is loaded with information, and is not a dry read like so many other biographies. It was a valuable tool for me when I was creating my Dean Koontz website as it contains contains chronological listings of all of Koontz's works, almost all of his pseudonyms, and a year-by-year breakdown of highlights in his career. Whether you're tracking down information for a school report or a newspaper article or just searching for more about the life of one of America's most prolific writers, then this book is for you."
5,Worth every minute to a Koontz fan,"This is an excellent visit with Dean Koontz! His life is detailed, and throughout the chronological tour of his life are sprinkled his books, with explanations and examples. The down side to this is that occasionally too much of a book's detail is revealed to one who has not yet read the book. I have found this intriguing, but others may feel it is too revealing.The feeling at the end of the book is that I had just visited with Mr. Koontz and he had explained his novels in relation to his life. Thoroughly enjoyable reading, and I don't usually enjoy ""biographies."""
5,YOU MUST READ THIS BIOGRAPHY,"When you start reading a certain author often, you become eager to know more about his/her life. When Dean Koontz became my favourite writer, I was thirsty to knowm more about him. So God sent Katherine Ramsland. And I'd say, she made a WONDERFUL job. Even if you don't like biographies, you must read that one. It's the kind of book you don't make any effort to read. When you see, you are almost at the end of it. Katherine wrote such a wondeful book that you just can't put it down. And Dean has an interesting life too. READ IT! You won't be disappointed!"
4,"Good, fun instruction for children. Ages 5 or 6 to 12.",Ordered this video for 4 year old grandson. He enjoyed watching it and tried a few steps but it is a little advanced for 4 years. Feel older children who like western things or like line dancing could have fun and learn from it.
3,Not what I expected,"This is not good for puppies, only good for small dogs that are strong chewers. A medium to large sized dog could swallow it whole. You cannot smell any chocolate, but maybe a dogs sense of smell can pick it up."
2,Editor's Help Needed,"Not what I expected. The book's subtitile promised it would ""overturn everything you thought you knew about Britain and the First World War."" Instead it was a poorly presented reposte to the criticism of the British army's actions in the war and its generals' ineptitude. An editor should have reorganized the book into a point-by-point discussion of ""standard history"" v. ""reality"" (as seen by the author), and cut down the size."
4,Cute socks,"I received these socks much sooner than I expected. They're different from the usual socks you find in the stores. The material is a little thin, but not a problem. Good for wearing with casual clothes, especially with clogs, as they'll be more visible!"
2,Not the perfect fit,"I bought two pairs of Hue women's socks (one size fits all). However, I found that the heels do not fit tightly as would be expected. Don't think I will buy Hue socks again."
4,Nice socks!,"I had to look high and low to find some blue socks. (They seem to have been declared illegal a few years ago.) Amazon has a lot of choices, and I bought these in navy and denim. They are very nice! They fit well, they have a simple pattern, but not too crazy for work. I would buy these again."
3,Cronological sequence list!,"I've read Sharpe's India books, and Sharpe's Rifles and very much enjoyed all of them. I am extremely frustrated however, that I cannot find a true chronological listing of what is, in fact, a continuing story! Amazon, you can do better than you have if you want to. I wish you wanted to!"
3,Sharpe's Rifles,"I love the Sharpe series, as well as almost all the books by Cornwell. The problem with this audio version is getting past the narrator's poor attempt to sound like characters he is portraying.He would have been better off with a straight read than making Sgt. Harper sound like a scrawny weasel of an Irishman (definitely not my idea of him), or Blas Vivar who sounds like a throat cancer victim. I won't even expand on what he does to the heroine.All in all though, it is a great way to pass the time if your driving or have time to wait for your girlfriend (my girl is always late). Don't let this put you off too much though, it is still a great story, and of coarse it's still Sharpe, Harper and the Rifles marching to Paris and killing sinister Frogs on the way. Ah, if life were only so simple!God save Ireland!"
4,Antidote to Road Rage,"Bernard Cornwell is an unabashed formula writer, but nobody does that formula better. If you have a long drive ahead of you, or a long commute, nothing helps the miles pass than the exciting (and violent!) adventures of Richard Sharpe. You'll be so engrossed in the story, that red lights and traffic jams will make you happy, because it will give you time to listen to more of the exciting story.Frederick Davidson is not my favorite narrator for the 'Sharpe' series, but that's just a personal preference, he's definitely one of the top vocal talents in the world of audio books."
5,Outstanding!,"One of the best novels in the Sharpe series. Unlike later novels, in which Richard Sharpe seems infallible and invincinble,Sharpe's Rifles portrays the hero as insecure and uncertain of his abilities. The novel also introduces Sgt. Patrick Harper andbegins to develop the relationship between these characters."
5,Major Sharpe has enough brawn and brain to perservere.,Major Sharpe has been given every gritty job possible in the campaigns in hopes of breaking him but his fortitude and intelligence shines through. In those special moments he also shows a remarkable sensitivity that is unique.
4,Engaging Start to the Sharpe Series,"This was my first foray into the Napoleonic historical fiction genre (including the Hornblower series as well as the Aubrey/Maturin books) and since I am more of a landlubber I went with the Sharpe series. The writing style can be light and fluffy at times but there is enough period detail to keep the historian in you engaged. The action is quite bloody and there is a certain gritty realism to much of the story. I could have done without the whole chick element that Louisa brings but it does serve to offer some insight into Sharpe's character by the end of the story. A quick read, and hard to put down. I'm looking forward to Sharpe's Eagle."
5,LIght infantry development with a story,"Fascinating tale but with detail on the development of light infantry tactics and the initial use of the, then, new rifle. Loved the movie/DVD on it also even though it had to cut some corners combined two stories and was low budget. Well worth reading and watching the whole series."
5,great start to an addictive series,"This is an excellent action book. Sharpe is a strong character, and the historical context of the story is very interesting. Cornwell's battle scenes are very well done. As with all the books in the series, Sharpe and Harper lead a charmed life (all other characters except the Duke of Wellington are fair game for a French bullet), so you always know he will get out of whatever predicament he finds himself in, but it doesn't matter. This book is definitely well worth the read if you are into this genre."
5,A must buy for skiers at Jackson Hole,"Very useful book, details lots of runs in Jackson Hole that are not on the piste map. Explains difficulty of each run very well. Small enough to carry with you in a ski jacket pocket."
5,Jonathan - A Rare Gem among Books,"Jonathan accuratly portray life in England during the 19th century. This heart warming book, about an orphaned family and how they survived with the help of a boy named Jonathan, is sure to be enjoyed by people of all ages. Though this book is out of print, and slightly expensive, it is well worth your money to buy it, and your time to read it."
4,It's fun but the handle is a little uncomfortable,I've been dying to get a blue lightsaber because they are so cool looking. I was debating which one to get Obi-Wan or Anakin.I decided Anakin since i had the Luke one. The only thing i dont like about this is the handle. It is uncomfortable. Cause if you like having two hands together it is hard to do unless u have small hands. Cause u will keep pressing the button to change the color {which is an awesome feature}. Thats why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The only difference between Anakin's and Darth Vator's is some of the parts turn black when he becomes DV. Amazing lightsaber i advise u get this lightsaber.
5,Good deal!,"My son just HAD to have this saber -- it lasted about a week -- his playing with it, that is. All of the stores in our area were out, and K-mart was MORE EXPENSIVE (if they'd had it) than my Amazon order (including shipping).When my son used it, he was VERY HAPPY with it. I think it met our expectations."
3,dissapointing,"first,lemme start off by stating the postives.the sounds are realistic and sound like they do in the movies.changing colors of the blade is also pretty cool.but the blade does not go into the handle all the way nor does it have a belt clip.only half of the blade goes in.and that part does not even lock so its comes out all the time.for 7 bucks cheaper you can get a lightsaber that locks on the blade and comes out with a button.it also has a belt clip.however if u arecollecting the lightsaber and not opening it i recommend u take this one.but on the roleplaying you should stick to the 7 dollar one."
4,"Good lightsaber, but Obi-wan's is better","This line of Episode III electronic lightsabers is way cool. The most realistic made so far. The ignition sound, and hum make it feel good to weild in your hand. Technically this is not Anakin's lightsaber, it's really the style that Darth Vader uses. The special feature this one has is that with a button press you can switch the color from red to blue.This one is not as cool as the Obi-wan lightsaber which has a much better hum. Although this ""Anakin"" saber does have two nice contact sounds when you hit something.So overall, I would say this makes an Excellent Darth Vader lightsaber, but not a realistic Anakin saber."
5,the greatest lightsaber By: kenold jonsint,"hello. i would like to start out with an intruduction. this lightsaber rocks!!! it makes sound,changes anakin blue to vader red, is looks very authentic like the ones they really use . overall this toy is the great!so get urs quickly wen its in stock cause thers a limmited amount of stock on amazon!and the price on ebay is way over ur heads!!!!"
5,Pretty cool,"This is a cool toy for anyone young or old, The only thing is the light is bad unless you are in a dark place. Otherwise this toy rocks."
5,ONE OF THE BEST STARWARS LIGHTSABERS YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am a nine year old kid that loves starwars!I got this light saber just 4 months ago and it's going so far so good and so fantastic!!Why this toy is so great to me is the color changing of the blade, sound fx, and the wavy light when I swing it around in the dark and I mean it glows in the dark!So if your child doesn't have this toy and they are dying for it go to a store where ever Star wars toys are sold!!Hey kids if your wanting this toy beg your parents immediatly because you need it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,What a fun toy,My two grandkids really love this toy. One is in PA the other in Scotalnd. They couldn't believe it when the lightsabers came they were so excited and its really been fun for them. I didn't think the fun would last but it does.
1,not that good,I wanted this lightsaber so bad when I got it I was so excited but when i startaed to use it i asked my mom to return it so it is going back tommorrow. Let me tell you what is wrong.1.oversized2.overpriced3.the blade doesnt go in all the way4.turns itself off after 45 sec.
2,So-So,"I was looking for something I could use to supplement an oral presentation. I work with people in recovery - high risk for many STDs - and this would have put people to sleep in 5 minutes. It was 'nice to know' information, but there was nothing in it that I care to share in a DVD format that I could not do more effectively with an oral presentation. Unfortunately, there is never an informative AND interesting DVD series of STDs. I would recommend the HBO series ""Addiction; Why Can't They Just Stop?"" as one of the best DVD presentations on said subject."
2,teapot,"I am satisfied enough. The tealeaf infuser was broken, but since I can still use the teapot, I did not return it. The price was cheap enough that I will accept it the way it is."
3,"Bad paint job, useless infuser but otherwise ok",The drawing on this teapot has a kind of bleed over effect with thick lines that makes the details indistinguishable. I have the teacups with this pattern as well and the lines are much thinner allowing you to see the detail.The infuser has very large holes that allow some finer leaves through. The lid I expect to break any day since I keep forgetting to hold it in place. The handle though is sturdy and allows easy handling even when the pot is full.Overall it is passable but not great.
1,Breakable,"Packing is not up to par. 1st one received was broken, re-order second one and it came in broken also. Just felt if re-order the third it would be no better. The infuser and lid are loose on the top of the tea pot with nothing between them."
3,Infused damaged,"I believe there is a problem with packaging. My infuser was damaged when I got it. The product quality was great otherwise, great color and very attractive."
5,This disc is not leaving the car's CD player....,"I received this CD as a Christmas gift from my friend because he knew that I liked acoustic rock. Well he was right on. This disc is perfect for a long Sunday drive, just hit track 1 and enjoy the next 45 minutes. The songs with their creative and substantial lyrics make you drift off in thought, so much so that I usually miss my exit. Needless to say, I will definately catch these guys in NYC. I suggest you take a listen, a true diamond in the rough."
2,Balcony and Roof Gardens:,"Lots of ideas but limited to outdoor decor (pots, furniture, accessories, color schemes, etc). Cutesy gets old after a while. Very little guidance on growing plants on balconies."
2,Find a better book,"This book was a disappointment; the illustrations were not up to standard for a book of this kind, the writing was pedestrian and the printing too small for comfort. The writer had nothing new to offer on the topic. There are better books about balcony and roof gardens. Don't waste time on this one."
3,Shadow Touch,"Perhaps Elena Baxter is an angel, she's certainly worked miracles, healing broken minds and bodies with a touch of her mind, though at great cost to herself. Her weakened condition after one such healing leaves her vulnerable to being taken. She is not the only one. Arthur Loginov is a detective who helps the helpless with his own set of incredible talents; shape shifting, pyrokinesis, and telepathy. These two are caged like animals by those who want to use them, and only by uniting their gifts can they hope to escape and stop the ones who took them from hurting others.*** Simply put, this is an X - men or Mutant X for adult ladies. The action, though fast paced, is enhanced by the romance and getting to see inside the souls of the characters. However, don't take the above statement as a sneer, since I was a little girl once who read the X men, I think this is a terrific concept and look forward to seeing more. ***Amanda Killgore"
5,Another winner!,"In Shadow Touch, Majorie Liu has done it again with her follow up to Tiger Eye. Artur Loginov is gifted/cursed with the power to know someone simply by touch. Elena Baxter can heal with her hands. They find themselves kidnapped by a truly horrific organization. Finding each other, finding others in their prison, escaping is all part of a fast paced and exciting story. Artur was featured in Tiger Eye and I immediately hoped his story would be quick in coming. Ms Liu does not disappoint. Her characters are interesting, exciting and inspite of the ESP-type talents, they are real in a story which is a blend of romance and horror."
4,Super Reader,"I thought I would give this a go when I saw it because she has written an X-Men novel. Some definite similarities, so she is pretty clearly a fan.At the start, two people with superhuman mental abilities are kidnapped and subjected to nasty testing and imprisonment.When they finally escape they discover a couple of shapeshifters held there, and the woman discovers the man has connections to an agency called Dirk and Steele that knows about this.Mind controllers and killers are after them, and they have to escape through Russia and try and work out what is actually going on.She discovers there are others, people who can disappear, electrokinetics, and all sorts of abilities at Dirk and Steele.A pretty decent adventure, and light on the romance side of things, despite the cover.Superfans shouldn't mind this one, and it is part of a series."
3,Just okay...,"I can't say that I hated this, on the contrary. But I also can't say I loved it. I'm a big fan of Marjorie and so far she's become a must buy, but if the next book leaves me feeling just sorta blah, then I dunno anymore.Basically it was all action, tons of X-men themes in there, and not really much to the romance. I felt we got more of the romance while Elena and Artur were imprisoned then when they got out. I dunno, the sex scenes lacked any sorta spark (almost as if she put them in there because they're a requirement of the genre...I simply did not believe the romance between the two and therein lied my problem) and while the plot was intriguing it was also a little predictable. The ending hook was cool enough that I'd go and buy the next book, but I think she's going to have to really up the anty with the next book and make me fall in love all over again. This was no Tiger Eye, it was just okay."
3,Hope you like 100 pages of torture,"Because that's what you get in this paranormal romance. All the other reviewers' comments about the exquisite writing style and strong characterization are spot-on, but you'd better enjoy an opening with a (thankfully) brief description of a sickeningly brutal rape, followed by a hundred pages of torture and victimization."
1,Poor Quality Kindle Edition - Buyer Beware,"The Kindle edition of Shadow touch is of extraordinary bad quality. The font is garbled and mis-shaped. The text does not layout correctly in many locations. The entire book appears to to be in bold font. The ""pages"" turn very slowly. The readability is very poor. I have enjoyed the books in this series so I didn't bother to download a sample and just one-clicked instead. My bad. Buyer beware.I doubt I will finish it due to the poor quality of this version. Kindle editions are usually great and I find them to be easier to read than traditional books. Not this time."
3,"Story Great, Format Terrible","Shadow Touch is the ninth Kindle book I have read, as I just received my Kindle for Christmas. The story is great. The format is terrible. I have read 8 other kindle books, some free and some that I paid for. This is the only one so far with format issues. I love Marjorie M. Liu and the Dirk & Steel books. This kindle edition leaves much to be desired. The font is difficult to read and looks like someone used an antique copier to copy a badly printed print copy and then didn't bother to clean it up at all. A whole section near the end only had 2-3 words per line, smashed up on the right, no matter what my settings were. I stuck with it for the great story and the convenience of using my Kindle, but I regret paying for such a poorly formatted book. Hopefully I will not encounter this problem with future Kindle books."
5,Great,Just got my book in the mail and It looked exactly as described there are no complaints.Will order again next semester.
2,Self-Absorbed & Self-Righteous,"The speaker of these poems, in his cavalier attitude and faux importance, is unbearable. The poetry is a bad cross of Mark Doty and Henri Cole, but the description here is overdone Doty, and the lacerative language is too overblown when compared to Cole. The run-to-the-top-of-the-hill-and-scream melodrama of these poems is just depressing to watch. Mark Wunderlich knows how to make poems--as evidenced here--but he is too concerned with being a ""voice"" and being THE voice of gay men. As a gay man, I don't want Mr. Wunderlich speaking for me. I much prefer to read poems in the voice of one gay man than poems where the speaker is trying so hard to be the voice of an entire group of people."
1,"presumptuous, pretentious","there's a tendency in younger poets to want to make huge claims with a voice that is neither confident nor earned. here is an example of that. poems that ""witness"" are powerful, exact, and if done well, teach the reader something important; poems that ""see"" are flawed and lack the insighful vision that make me want to read more carefully. I knew I was in trouble when I went from one poem to another without the need to slow down and absorb what I had just read. I ""see"" what this guy talks about all the time."
2,wireless camera,I dont' think its the best camera. Sctatchy noise has to be plugged in to extension cord because batteries are rechargeable and last only 4 hrs. Good for the price to be able to watch things and the audio is good.
2,"ok, but not great","Ok, this product does what it says it does sometimes. It wouldn't work straight out of the box, and then magically started working. When working it worked very well. Also, it has a tendency to interfer with the wireless network in my house."
3,Good clear picture and good audio!,"I am a computer technician, I also install surveillance cameras, everyone needs to understand, if you have a wireless router that uses 2.4 Ghz frequency, the picture will not be clear, it lasted a while, then the wire got pinched in the window, the whole camera burned, in the inside, could of started a fire, if you have money, buy wired cameras, they are alot better!"
1,Junk,"poor resolution, blurry and as a bonus: the picture gets worse over time. infrared lights on the camera are good for 3 feet."
2,"Well, not for a beginner...",You will still need either a good book or a friend to help you figure out how to hold the pen and make the letters. This is just a kit w/ paper and pens and the pens weren't even that great. No matter how you write they don't make lines that transition between fat and thin. Might as well use a regular pen...I am kinda dissapointed and will keep looking for better pens.I give it 2 stars for dollar value.
1,poorly made leaky product,"This product did not live up to my expectations. The ink cartridges leak, the pens are made of thin plastic and are not durable, the ink cartridges are difficult to install. It was a very disappointing christmas gift for my 10 year old daughter. Next time I won't buy something like this online...I'll buy something that I physically see and use."
3,good product,It is nice in how they are designed. There is not enough instructions and help to learn.
4,Perfect beginner set,"I think other reviewers had too high of an expectation for this beginner's kit. You get what you pay for when it comes to calligraphy pens! All I can say is that I bought this for an artistic 11-year-old. In less than 30 minutes, she created a beautiful card! It was worthy of mailing to a dear friend who has been practicing the art of calligraphy for over 20 years."
5,Enchanting!,"A small volume, but exquisitely illustrated, and a lyrical ""lullabye"". While I've seen other reviews about it being translatable from the kittycat to a child (which I'm sure is the intent), I prefer its attributation to a beloved kittycat. A sweet little volume, for any species"
5,A nurse's favourite dressing,"Love Allevyn products, especially the adhesive ones. They are great for moist wound healing and they stay in place even in awkward areas or with moderate drainage. The imitations do not even come close by comparison. They are comfortable for the patient too and while expensive, are very worth it. Seems to be a miracle product."
1,"Just awful, especially if you know the operetta well","After being delighted by the Stratford performance of the Mikado, I quickly bought this one, and what a huge mistake. If you aren't very familiar with the score, you might enjoy it, but if you know Pirates by heart, you will cringe. The horrors begin with Pirate King quoting Shakespeare and the girls stripping down to Victorian underwear on the beach-- accompanied by awful new dialogue. Gilbert would turn over in his grave. And it just gets worse. The sound quality is bad; Fredrick is dull and hasn't much of a voice, and the applause is distracting... which is isn't in the Mikado. It's customary to add little touches and in jokes (see I've Got A Little List in the Mikado), and that's fine, but this is just beyond the pale. Save your money, and buy this company's wonderful Mikado. (Even my 8 year old son, who has never seen this and loves pirates in general, greatly preferred the Mikado.)"
2,blech,"I rented this from the library, luckily, thinking naively that because it was the Pirates of Penzance, it would be nothing other than a treat. What I found instead was a shabbily acted, and even more so sung, operetta where all I could do was cringe and be sorry that I was replacing my memories of the hilarious masterpiece with such an unworthy production.What bothered me the most was that Maybel and Friedrich were both so unlikeable! Maybel I can't claim was off-key because she was on every key! Friedrich was anything but ""exceeding beauty"" and I don't think any girl would be wooed by that whiny, wimpy voice of his.Just about every other character disappointed me as well, though the pirate king had his moments. I did find that they all sounded good together in the choruses. Overall, though, I expect better quality to match to the genius of Gilbert and Sullivan."
5,The Best-Loved Comedy: The Pirates of Penzance,"This is my fave. movie. After I saw my friends perform this play on the stage, I knew I had to see the movie. The movie even had some things that weren't in the play, which was awesome to see. I now know all the songs by heart, and can't watch it enough times. You will not want to miss seeing this."
1,Smaller than expected,"When you review the specifications of this map you see 8 papes what you are not told is when you unfold the entire map it only measures 8 1/2 by 32 inches.it only covers "" downtown Athens "" I was looking for a resturant in the outskirts of Athens hopeing I could find it in this map.I purchased a map in Athens a few years ago which is more complete.I wouldn't recommend this map to anyone.I also purchased a Michelin road map to Greece and it was just as I expected very detailed mapB.W."
3,Pocket sized map,"How big is your pocket?? The map is great, however it is huge. I bought it because I had previously had ""pocket-sized"" laminated metro maps for London and Paris. They were amazing. This looks like a great map, but it's so large and cannot be folded down due to the fact that it is laminated. Disappointed, but I can take it in my travel bag."
4,Great maps!,"I've used the Streetwise Paris map several times and am looking forward to using the Athens one on my upcoming trip to Greece. The Paris map is complete, thorough, useful, etc. It folds into a small size and is waterproof for rainy days. These are great maps - try them! The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that the Paris map is set up somewhat confusingly - with the middle on one side and the areas both North and South of that on the other side. But it was fine once I remembered that odd placement."
1,Cover ripped just over 6 months....,"I purchased this cover back in April 2010 for my costco grill. I live in Phoenix az where the climate can be extreme at times, and I have yet to find a cover that can last thru a summer here. When I purchased this cover, it appeared to be more durable than the cheap vinyl covers that you find at various hardware stores. It ripped just over 6 months from when I purchased it. The fabric becomes brittle and rips easily. Buyer beware."
4,Anastacia Improves With Time,"I have never been much of a fan of Anastacia's music. I mostly think she is an incredibly gifted vocalist who would benefit from handing the pen and paper over to Max Martin (she's already got the skimpy outfits, so why not?). Her voice is a beautiful tool somewhere between Macy Gray and Aretha Franklin.But: She has a real problem writing a catchy tune. Every single song she's written has been dull and never does her voice justice.One Day in Your Life shows that she has learned... a little. It's mostly good because of the way she sings, but also has a fun (but tired) message and decent rythm. I have yet to hear her album in full, but am pretty excited about it.If Anastacia can continue to improve her writing skills to meet her vocal talents, she very well may be the next Mariah Carey."
5,Easiest science book,"I love this book. I understand the concepts because of great illustrations and straightforward text. The problems at the end of the chapter and more at the end of the book, are very helpful toward understanding the material. If you are a home study parent looking for a physics book your child can understand, this book is for you."
5,Would definitely recommend,This is an excellent Bible! I would definitely recommend this Bible to anyone. There are many articles dealing with today's problems through related scripture. It is also a very good study Bible.
4,Sunterra 104506 fountain pump,Product works very well and is extremely competitively priced.I will purchase again when necessary and may purchase another immediately to have as a spare.
2,Sunterra Table Top Pump,The thing crapped out on me after only 4 days. I'm not sure what happened but it just stopped working.
2,Not compatible with Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain,"I bought this b/c in the picture it has 2 adapters.When I received it it only had 1 adapter.I was hoping to use this to replace my:Drinkwell Platinum Pet Fountain, considering it'simpossible to replace the pump w/out purchasing a wholenew system. Someone stated this pump was compatiblewith it, it's not."
2,Too little output & not adaptable to more than one hose size,This was purchased as a replacement pump to a very small fountain and yet was inadequate. The fountain has standard piping and yet was too large for this output orifice. The picture looks as though the pump would accommodate more than one size piping but in reality that was not possible. I had to go to the hardware store and buy an adapter which added a significant cost to the pump.
3,Sunterra Fountain Pump,It was a nice little pump but they don't last too long before you have to be replaced them especially if you use them all the time without stopping them like in a fountain or fish tank.
3,Sunterra 104506 not as powerful as I thought it would be.,"This fountain pump functions just fine, but the water flow is not very lively. It is possible that I should have ordered a larger fountain pump, to move more water more rapidly. Maybe this product should be labeled as being only for very very small fountains. For a medium to large size fountain such as I have, especially if you are hoping to clearly hear the water bubbling in the fountain, it is just not powerful enough to really move enough water for this effect. Just doesn't work well enough for me..."
3,"Maybe the right size, but not recommended for Drinkwell Platinum Pet System","For anyone buying this pump as a lower cost option for a Drinkwell Platinum Pet Water system, my suggestion would be not to do it. This pump runs on AC power. This means that household current is going directly to the pump in the pet water system. The original pump uses DC power (low voltage) to operate. In the case of some kind of electrical malfunction of the pump, the pet's water and in turn the pet or the pet caretaker could be exposed to AC current and possibly be electrocuted. I understand that this type of failure is rare (pump is made in China)but I would rather pay the extra $12 to eliminate this chance of injury. Besides, the cable is much heavier because of the high voltage source so I would think it would be very difficult to route through the watering system as the low voltage cable is routed."
5,Moves a good amount of water for a small device,"This small pump is surprisingly powerful, and will work well for any sort of small fountain. The small adjustment slider controls the flow, though not to a great extent. The two included nozzles are great for fitting the pump to hoses of various size. The smaller nozzle fit perfectly inside 1/2"" (outside diameter) plastic hosing. I could get the pump to drive water about three feet vertically, though it was clearly struggling at that point. The height of the pump requires it to be placed in water more than an inch deep, but if you cover the top half of the intake face, the pump can be used in much shallower water without sputtering. The included suction cups on the bottom of the pump are nice, but be sure to plan for the cord if you are building a fountain, as it is extremely thick and does not bend easily. This is a very versatile pump for home fountains or DIY projects involving water."
4,Table Top Pump,"After looking for a replacement at local stores, found this pump. It is able to slow down enough to be used on our table fountain. What a buy you can't beat it."
3,Barely decent,"i'm using it for a small fountain. this pump is very weak. you must use it at maximum setting, less than that it doesn't move any water. it is barely enough to push the water up in a 3 inch long vertical pipe (very small section). working out good for my purpose, since i wanted to minimize water splashing out, but if you're looking for a small water jet you'll need something more powerful. this pump is about half size than a pack of cigarette."
5,Bird Bath Water Pump,"I have nothing bad to say, it did what i wanted it to do and is still working find, if i had to replace it i would buy the same one."
4,Works as described by other reviewers,"This is the second time i have used this pump to replace others that have failed. The pump is quiet and lifts water to the height listed in the specs.The pump does not look like the one pictured although it is functionally the same.Delivery, using standard shipping, was a day faster then expected."
5,exactly what I wanted,Needed a small pump for tabletop fountain and this is perfect. I got what I wanted and ordered. Easy to use and would order again
5,Sunterra pump,"Worked very well, even though my original one started working once I had plugged this one in! Maybe the old one didn't want to be replaced afterall"
3,a good little pump,This tiny pump is just what I needed to power my little waterfall. The quality of being adjustable is great!
5,It is working as expected :),I purchased this pump for a small tabletop fountain. It is quiet and working well.
1,What a piece of CRAP!,"Well, check the packaging, ""Made in China"". That's nice. Cheap and no doubt made by slave labor. Great! So they pass on the SLAVINGS to me. But I end up with an inferior piece of plastic that doesn't work. At all. I will never buy anything from China again. What a waste of time and money.Do yourself a favor, don't buy from this company. This is the second pump I've purchased from them and both have had issues."
1,cord way to big,"the pump is ok,,,but the cord that comes with it is bigger then the pump. so unless you can lock the cord down some how,,you will have a problem, it will drag the pump sideways, etc"
5,Great pumps!,These pumps are great. I used one to replace one in my tabletop waterfall and one to make a small fountain of my own. They both move a lot of water for such a small size. Great investment!
3,"Aight it's tight, but don't diss Ca$h Money!","If u don't like Cash Money buy this album,but if not it's for u,if u like No Limit buy this album!OK it's got some tight tracks but the main point of the album is to diss Cash Money.I think on there next joint(if there is one)they will probably diss Big Shots records,cuz I can remember Will-Lean of Botany Boyz dissing T-Bone of Wet Boys,I like Cash Money & Big Shots,so don't take this dissing too far,cuz a whole lot of rappers from Texas is down with Big Shots & Cash Money,like Scarface,Lil Keke, & T-Mac from Nashville too.Ya'll don't want no 3rd Coast War!!!"
3,i liked em boys from da south.,"it got that krunk song on there, supersoaker. they going off on them hot boys because they were so-called ""weren't good enough. ain't nothin' wrong wit them boys style. if you get it, you gon' be like ""dang, they on fire""."
4,corelle is very functional,"I like the pattern and the shape, and as usual with corelle, it is resilient, dish washer safe and stain resistant."
2,Sloppy packaging,"Flash Gordon is as hokey and entertaining as he was half a century ago but the folks who put this package together were lazy. There are a dozen or so individual Flash Gordon episodes on each disk but there are no ""breaks"" between them. If you watch three one night and want to pick up where you left off the next day, you have to start the disk all over again. There is no way to go straight to the next episode. You have to repeat the episodes that preceeded it. This is simply lazy or slopy on the part of the people who put the package together. They don't deserve your business."
2,Not quite what was expected,"Slightly disappointed in that the boxed set contained both the some of the original Buster Crab series plus more recent material, (1970's I think, since only going off what my Father in Law informed me). If had realised later material included in the boxed set, I would have gone for another boxed set. Discription on Amazon some what misleading."
2,doesn't want to stay closed,"I bought this case along with an SD1100 camera, as the description states that it is made for it. BUT, while the camera fits, the magnetic closure is either very weak or poorly designed as it always wants to flop open. I would've have thought that the Canon case would be of a better build quality. Now I know it's not. I would not recommend this item."
2,Beware if you have an SD1000,"I have two SD1000 cameras, one for work and one for my wife. We bought a Canon case that looks identical to this for the first one, and it was great. It is just slightly larger than the camera, is easy to put the camera in and out, and thus protects it well. I keep the lanyard out of the side so that I can wear it around my neck. I ordered this case for my wife and got an identical LOOKING case that is much larger, it still holds and protects the camera but is thicker, wider, and taller than our other case and thus defeats the purpose of having the tiny camera. I suspect they may be making the case larger now since people complained that it was hard to fit camera in and out, but I never had any problems. Perhaps this bigger case can hold a spare battery or memory card wedged against the camera, but that's not what I wanted when I ordered it. I would really like to know where to get the case we have for the first camera."
3,not perfect,"the camera fits fine, but the strap buckle makes it difficult to pull the camera out of the case - ok for what it does"
2,A good cover with some design quirks but it kills the whole point of having a compact camera!,"This is a good high quality cover. Well, thats about all that is good.The biggest issue I have is with how bulky it makes the camera. You buy a camera which is subcompact expecting to slip it into a pocket unnoticed. Then you buy this cover from the manufacturer for the same camera and it literally doubles the volume of the camera. That too without adding any useful pockets for spare batteries, memory card etc! I think that is unacceptable.Also, the slot on the cover flap for passing the camera strap is useless and shocking given that Canon designed the cover as well as the camera! The camera strap has this small friction device that lets you adjust strap length. However, the slot is not large enough to let that device pass through. So you essentially cannot pass the strap through the slot.Very disappointing I must say."
3,"Nice case, but...","I bought this case for the Canon SD1100 Gold. It fits snugly inside with no room for anything else, including the wrist strap which should fit through the space at the top of the case. Mine has no room for carrying extra cards or batteries. My case is definitely burgundy but it is not a soft leather. It is a hard textured surface but it is attractive. The case does make carrying my camera more bulky but protection from damage is more important than size."
3,Camera case,The camera case is sturdy and protects the camera. It would be good to have a small area for a spare battery or memory card but it is compact which is good. It's easy to open to get the camera out in a hurry.
2,doesn't fit the SD1100IS,"I ordered this case based on other reviews on Amazon which said it fits the SD1100IS. While the camera fits in the case, it's just SLIGHTLY too big. The front flap of the case has a little magnet to hold it closed but, because the camera is too big, the flap won't stay closed--it pops open in a doofy-looking fashion. I'm sending it back...."
4,Perfect fit for SD1100IS,"I wanted something that wouldn't add too much bulk to a tiny camera so I figured I need to go with Canon's case. The camera slips right in and stays secure and you can feed the wrist strap through the hole on the top. I then can just slip the camera in the front pocket of my jeans.It is unfortunate there is no place to put any extra memory cards or batteries, but that is not the point of this case. It would require extra bulk and negate a compact case. I would have preferred something more like neoprene as the material, but I took what I could get."
4,Almost Perfect,"This case is a great selection if you want something small and not bulky. It does its job very well and only with one minor flaw. I find that when you take your camera out of the case, if you have a wrist string, the plastic bits on the wrist string get caught coming through the hole, so you can't just whip out your camera."
4,Nice compact case,"The SD1000 fits almost perfectly into this case. It is solid enough to protect the camera well, but is not too thick, so it still fits nicely your the pocket. That also means there is no room to carry anything else inside it.The major issue with this case is the hole through which the strap needs to be threaded to close the flap is too small / not well designed. It'll take me at least half a minute to get the strap throguh the hole correctly, something I'm not willing to do. However simply taking the strap around the flap (taking it out from a side) works well enough, and the magnet is strong, so the flap doesn't come out easily.The case also looks really nice, a lot better than most camera cases I've seen, which matters a lot. I would say it's a good buy."
3,"Good quality, but poor price","I am happy to have this case with Canon Powershot SD1000. It's easier to put on my belt when going out. However, my wife got mad on the price and I became a burning money monster."
4,good enough case,"I was looking for a case to protect my 200 dollar investment, and came upon this case that was made specifically for the SD1000. The camera fits snugly in the case, and it appears to have a good padding to cover the front and back. The slit for the wrist strap wasn't a problem for me, you just have to force it through a little. Like the previous reviewers said, this only holds the camera. I like it so far; protects the camera, looks classy, and although it adds bulk to the camera making it impossible to carry just in your pockets, I'm pretty sure all cases will do that to any camera. I could do without the belt loop in the back, but it's not a big deal."
4,Good Case,"Overall, this is a great little case if all you want to do is carry the camera in it. It fits the camera perfectly, and does not add a lot of excess bulk. The camera strap is a little cumbersome to get through the hole in the case flap, but because I use the camera so often, I just let the strap hang out the side. If you're not taking hundreds of pictures at a time and don't need a storage compartment for an extra battery, then this is a great case for simply toting your camera around from place to place."
5,Nifty cameral case,I just purchased a Canon PSC-1000 Deluxe Burgundy Leather Case for the Canon SD1000 Digital Camera. A great buy and seemingly hard to get. A must have addition for the Canon PSC-1000 camera!
1,the WRONG case,this is the wrong case for the canon sd 1100. it is way too big. i had to return it. dont know how amazon dropped the ball on this.
4,Red But Good,"Like others have stated, this case is more of a red than the brown color that is depicted in the picture. I will work on putting up a personal one of mine. Overall I feel that this is a decent case. I have the SD1100is and it works fine. I don't know why other people have had problems with it. As far as the hole goes, it is a bit small, but I was able to get all of the strap (including the plastic parts) through so that it fits snug. I would recommend this to anyone because it is a very chic look. Very feminine and compact. The only major complaint is that it doesn't have any extra pockets for memory cards as many others do. Great for the price."
5,Elegent cutty perfect match,"I just got back from my vocation with my new camera, and of course, my brand new Canon PSC-1000 Deluxe Grey Leather Case. It is cute, tiny, just fit for the camera,elegent, and of good touching. I like it very much! There is only one problem: if I put the handle of the cemera through the whole on the case, I could not take the camera out from the case; if I do not put the handle through the whole, the case did not close very firmly. But it is okay to me, not a big deal. Over all, the Deluxe Grey Leather Case for Canon PSC-1000 is a perfect match with the camera and an elegent look."
4,Good for protecting the camera,"Fits like a glove.Adds a bit of bulk to the size which is to be expected when storing the camera in a hard case. If you need the size to be as small as possible, look for a soft case.The magnet to keep it closed is nice, but I think it should be just a bit stronger.Good quality material."
4,"Holds camera perfectly, holds nothing else","Nice case. Very snug fit..nothing else will fit but the camera, which only bothers me because they claim it will hold memory card etc..it won't. Oh well. It is a little annoying to thread the wrist strap through the hole, but mine will still close even if I just put the strap to the side. Obviously the camera is less pocket size when in the case, but if you want to put it in a purse or coat pocket it's still fine."
3,stylish,this case is very stylish...how ever i gave it 3 because it does not have enough padding that can help with shock absorbtion
3,Not thrilled.,A pretty little case but not sand proof. Something I didn't think about when I bought it. I was at the beach when I first used my new camera and case. Had to keep it in a ziplock bag. I'm going to buy a zippered case that will do more to keep sand and dirt out.
1,"The material looks cheap, surface too hard",The size is not that compact. Material looks cheap. The surface feels very hard. Not recommend this product.
1,Canon Case,I do the majority of my shopping on Amazon and am please with the service and quality of the goods. I ordered the case to the sd-1000 after I ordered the camera.The case itself is to tight for the camera. If you leave the strap on the camera the cover to the case does not close properly The Magnet which hold the lid to the case does not have enough power. Velcro or a snap would have been better. Don't waste your Money.
1,Disappointed; In Case You Want To Know,"I just received this item for my first digital camera, an SD1000 Canon.I looks like a poor design. First of all, I would like to know where you are supposed to store the battery pack, compact flash card and wireless controller that it claims to accommodate in the description? The camera barely fits by itself! The magnetic closure is weak. Instead of the loop on the back provided to run your belt through, a quality clip for your belt would be much easier to use. Also, I don't understand what the slot in the top is for. The strap that came with the camera won't pass through it. This product appears to be hastily designed just to get something out the door. I may return it if I can find a better alternative locally."
1,Disappointing,"I should have read the negative reviews more carefully.I recently purchased this Canon case for my Canon SD1200IS. The case is snug but the camera fits. The major problem is that when you put the wrist strap through the slot (which is the only place it can go if you want the case to close), it is extremely difficult to remove the camera from the case. What is the point? I now need to purchase a different case."
2,Worthless; I threw it away,"When I bought my new camera I bought this case with it, thinking I might find nothing better. When I received it I saw that it does not fully enclose the camera, allowing rain and snow in. Furthermore, the magnetic closure is not realiable. This case is worthless. I felt it was too inexpensive to return so I threw it away. I found a much better case at Wal-Mart."
1,horrible,magnet to close does not work with camera in casesent back for refundthen i bought a samsonite case for five bucks at walmart
3,"Nice case for protecting the camera, but...","This snug leather case exactly fits the camera and provides excellent protection. The magnetic closure seems strong, but it would not fall off in any case. The belt loop appears to be glued on so we shall see how long lived that is. I never wear a belt and use the loop for a spare battery - which you will definitely want. The wrist strap fits through a hole in the top. It requires threading through the hole, which could cause you to miss a shot trying to get your camera out and at ready and then you are left holding the case in your hand or finding somewhere to stuff the case on the fly. Very inconvenient. We recently returned from a trip to Yellowstone and other places. I found it best to leave the case behind and just carry the camera."
2,The description is misleading!!!,"As the person stated above, it only fits accessories if they are WITHIN the camera!!Because there is only space for the camera body- nothing else. It's very frustrating. I really need to find a different case.Plus, the leather is really hard and plasticky."
2,Almost useless...,"I bought this case with the SD1000 camera and I've got to say that I'm pretty unhappy with it. The main issue is that the case WILL NOT FIT with a wrist strap on the camera, and thus the case won't close. There's a hole on the top of the case that I suppose is supposed to work with the strap, but the strap that ships with the camera is far too large to fit. The camera is tiny and really needs the wrist strap so this case is a bad bad choice. Go with something else.I'm back to using my old case that fits pretty good and actually has room for my extra battery, which you also must carry since this camera doesn't have a battery life meter. Of couse, you can hack the camera to add that... but that's not for the feint of heart ;)"
1,Not A Good Choice,This was advertised for the Canon 1100 but it is not a really good choice. It is very stiff and will not stay closed with the magnet latch which it comes with. We had to add velcro.
1,Snug fit,The camera barely fit inside the case and it does not have a strap for ease of handling. It does have a belt loop handle but it is made to slide onto your belt as opposed to a clip-on which is far more convienant. I would not recommend.
3,Canon psc-1000 deluxe leather case,"The leather case needed to be modified a little as other people have noted. The hole in the top for the strap is too small and needed to be reemed out a little. The magnet could be stronger, the case doesn't stay closed, seems a tad on the small side."
4,Case for Canon SD-1000 with magnetic fastener,This product is a little expensive for what it is but it works well enough. Very simple operation - camera fits inside and it closes with a magnetic seal.
3,Agreed,"I read a few of the earlier reviews, and I totally agree [except that I don't think the quality of leather is all that great]. It has a magnetic closure, fits snug, protects the camera, and it looks great [although more red then burgundy], BUT, the slit for the wrist band looks like it was cut with a leather punch and is likely to wear out quickly because it's too small... you're better off letting the wrist band hang through the side. It does NOT hold ANYTHING but the camera... it only holds the battery and memory card that are already INSIDE the camera, but otherwise the product description lied. I think the first commenter summed it up: Cannon should have just included this as a bonus with the purchase of the camera."
4,Canon Leather Case for SD1000,"This is a nice compact case, but there is no room for and extra battery or memory card. I would recommend this for ""around town"" use, but not for travel."
5,Great,It is really nice to be able to protect the screen of my camera while it is in my purse or luggage. It is not big or bulky. Perfect!
4,camera case,Fits camera like a glove. I don't like how you have to remove the lanyard out of the case to get the darn thing out. I would also prefer a belt clip instead of the loop.
2,Poor Design & Quality,"Canon PSC-1000 ""Leather"" Case feels more like cardboard and barely holds the camera. The magnetic snap is so weak it will not really hold the stiff flap closed. The design of the case is too small for the camera, which barely fits...too tight to accomodate the strap ...either off the side, or through the (under-sized) hole in the flap! That hole is useless anyway since it complicates getting the camera in and out of the case. I always left the strap out the side under the flap with the soft leather case for my old SD400 Canon.Canon should redesign the case with better leather and alittle more room under the flap!"
3,OK with modifications,"I read all the posts before I bought this case. I originally bought the case because I wanted a snug fitting case that I could keep in my front pocket. I bought the case and made the wrist strap hole bigger with a Dremel tool. The magnet was not strong enough to keep the case closed so I added velcro. The case now works great. Buy only if you want a snug fitting case with absolutely no room for anything else. Be ready to customize the case. The wrist strap hole is way, way, way too small to be functional. Case works great!!!!"
4,Canon leather case,It seems to be a good product. The only thing I would change is the strength of the magnet. At first it did not want to stay latched but seems to have no problem doing so now that it is broken in. I would go as far as to recommend it to a friend.
2,Cannon PSC-1000 Camera Leather case,"liked the product with the exception of color being grey not black, other than that loved the low price"
4,Does its job,"I bought this one for my GF's digicam (Powershot SD1000) more to protect it from scratch and stuffs like that, works fine."
2,Not as described,The description says this case has enough space for an extra battery and memory card and that is not the case.
3,Not the expected Colour but ok,"The actual quality is not as good as the photo would let you expect. It's made in China, thin leather, and the magnet doesnt hold that good, as another customer already noticed.I liked the ""minimalist"" design , but I if you are not a design freak, you might like to know that it's not so pratical to use (a little too tight and no room for safety ""link"" between the pouch and the camera).Most important, the colour is very different from the photos. Mine is a very dark grey, almost black . And I read on another review that the burgundy model is also quite different from the picture.On the whole, it's all right for price, though."
2,Canon Camera Carry Case,"Very disappointing for an OEM product. The case fits the camera and looks stylish sitting on a table. But the case is not very well padded to protect the camera. The belt loop is so tight, no belt will go through it, and if it did it would be very tight. The belt loop also looks flimsy and would pull loose or break if stressed very much. Save your money and go to WakMart and get a better case for less money."
4,Stylish addition to the Canon camera,"Great little Leather Case for our new Canon Powershot camera (the SD1100IS), with almost matching color. It would have been great though if a second battery would have fit somewhere in the case - luckily the battery last long, only once were we caught with an empty battery - we had not charged the battery during the night after a 'heavy' day with many pictures and some video's."
2,"A Protective Cover, But Doesn't Fit Properly","This case is far from deluxe. Yes, it'll prevent scratches, but the camera handle doesn't properly fit through the hole in this case. Also, the flap doesn't give me enough confidence that my camera won't slip out because the magnet isn't *that* strong. I think this case is about average in function but below average in look and feel, hence the two star review."
1,Not Compatible with SD1100,"It probably is a great camera case for the Canon SD1000, but this is NOT compatible with the SD1100. Be aware that Canon recommends the case, but I have brought this to there attention and they will be investigating."
5,"Great small package, that ensures it cant be stolen","At first it wouldnt close, but after a week or so, its a snug fit with the camera. Great case."
4,"Color alternative - give it a go, eh?","I chose the burgundy leather case rather than the gray for my Canon SD1000 digicamera just for a little color. Also, most of my leather accessories are burgundy or brown, so, if I wear the case on my belt it might seem to match a bit better. A little less industrial than the gray, so to speak.The case is made well. A little lighter than burgundy, I'd say, maybe a dark wine color. Completely functional for the SD1000 camera, but, just the camera, no accessories. Fits like a glove.Much to do about nothing; maybe. But, why not? Life's short."
2,Wrong product description,This case only carries the camera!!. The product description specifies that it carries the camera plus the battery and card!!
2,Canon PSC-1000 Deluxe Grey Leather,"I am glad to see everyone else has a problem w/ the strap! I read the other reviews after I bought so I could see if I was incompetent. The case fits the SD1000 perfectly, but it is awkward to remove the camera if you feed the camera strap thru the hole. Terrible engineering. You might be better off getting a generic case..."
3,Terrific except for one thing,"This is a great camera case -- it fits the camera perfectly and the magnet closure is strong and works well. The only problem is that if you put the camera strap through the hole in the top of the case (that is meant for the strap), then the case cannot stay closed. ...A design flaw that needs fixing. But if you don't put the strap on the camera, it's a perfect case."
4,Great case,"I read a lot of the other reviews before deciding to purchase this, so I knew it was going to be completely perfect. However, I actually really like it. It's a bit darker than it looks in the pictures, but that doesn't really matter. It is a tight fit for the camera, but not so tight that I can't get the camera in and out easily. I feel like it's really protecting the camera, which was why I bought it in the first place. (There's definitely not enough room for anything else though, so if you want something that will store extra stuff, this wouldn't work.)It is true that the wristband doesn't fit through the hole, but I just put it to the side and it works fine.Overall, I think it's a great case. It's small and compact so it doesn't add a lot of size to the camera, and it protects the camera from damage. If you want something simple and relatively inexpensive, this works great."
3,Decent camera case,"Canon PSC-1000 Deluxe Grey Leather Case for the Canon SD1000 Digital CameraThis case fits the camera well, although the fit was a little snug as the leather is a bit stiff. I'm sure it will soften with use. Although the case does not have space for any accessories it is very compact and allows for protection of the camera while at the same time allowing it to be carried in a pocket. The case includes a magnetic fastener seen at the bottom of the display photo, a belt fastener on the rear of the case, and an opening at the top of the case to allow the camera carrying strap to be used while in the case. The leather is a bit thinner, does not have a soft liner, and is not as good a quality as a previous Canon case I purchased for my Canon Power Shot SD450, but is still a good choice."
