5,Very thorough book.,"We require advisors and brokers to read this in our firm. It's not totally inclusive, but NO book is. But for the average person, there is more here than they even need. This is the book for professionals to brush up on and know all facts."
4,Comprehensive survey of planning strategies,"In 1975, the first edition of this book pointed out that personal financial planning is an extension of consumerism. Planning with objectives in mind helps consumers analyze the different financial products individually and in coordination with each other.The process has gotten so complex that few families can do it without help anymore. This edition has been updated and expanded to include more description of insurance, mutual funds, investment strategies, and retirement and estate issues. The authors' main bias is in favor of the planning process per se, not any one particular approach."
3,This was required for an MBA course,"I found it dry and dull and dragged myself through parts of it. It is fairly comprehensive, however, and will probably do better service as a reference when I forget material from the course."
5,Beautiful Christmas Story,"The product was shipped and delivered as promised. The books were in excellent condition. The story line is heart touching, thought provoking, and easily made relevant in our own lives. I was very pleased with all aspects of this transaction."
5,awesome,I love this book. Every family should have a copy.The illustrations are amazing. I enjoy reading it every Christmas.
5,Excellent book on Wireless Design,"Circuits and Wireless Communication designers and Enthusiasts....ENJOY!A true one-of-a-kind guide to wireless ""design"". It guides you through the design process step-by-step. The author presents design procedure for every circuit that make up a complete wireless system. He also provides design hints, tips and tricks. Primarily for Electrical Engineers and circuit and electronics enthusiasts, this book is a must for its primary audience. There's so much valuable information and experience in this book you won't find anywhere else.The book is not intended for people with no electronics or circuit design background. People without such background will find the book difficult to follow and comprehend. Communication designers and engineers, however, will be extremely delighted with this book.I'm greatly thankful for the author for his excellent book."
5,Exactly what i was looking for.,"I spent a lot of time trying to find the perfect Hamsa necklace. I wanted one that wasn't too big or too small, with a simple design. This one is seriously perfect. Not too loud, but shows itself nicely around the neck. Shipping was also extremely fast."
2,not what I expected,"I am not a huge fan of motion comics to begin with, but I have seen several that I have enjoyed from a plot and character development stand point.This one doesn't really develop anything. The episodes seem to be about 3 minutes long. While the idea of what would happen if Superman had landed in the USSR instead of the USA is intriguing, this really doesn't do any character or the story line justice, IMHO. Save your money."
3,Mediocore at best,"Its a motion comic, but not as good as others that came out. Some episodes are missing the introduction. Each episode contains two episodes and each one of those has the crappy introduction in it."
1,I should have looked at a trailer.,I was expecting a Superman cartoon that my son and I would enjoy. The plot sounded great -but I wasn't expecting still shots.
1,buy the graphic novel,"What can I say but wow. And not the good wow. the disappointing wow. I thought that this could actually be kinda cool but I was way wrong. the story is fragmented and one doesn't know whats really happening from one episode to the next unless you've read the comic. And thats what I'm saying, save your money and go buy the graphic novel cause if you haven't, this hodgepodge of the Red Son series will make little to no sense. And I had such high hopes. so sad..."
1,only 10 minutes long and not very interesting,"99 cents for 10 minutes or less, interesting concept ""what if superman's ship had landed in Russia and he grew up under that type of totalitarian regime"" -- but you only get a few minutes of story and the rest in screen credits, not worth 99 cents"
2,Not animation,"Being a huge fan of the Man of Steel since I was a child (I am now 58) I saw this new slant on the old story and I thought, ""Why not?"" I picked it up and quickly found out why not. This is a series of stills from the original graphic novel (which I already had) and provides very little additional material to the story. (I do not say ""none"" because the dynamism of the narrators count for something, doesn't it?) Get the graphic novel if you really want to read this novel. You can go at your own pace and you will find the story so much more enjoyable. This DVD was a waste of good money."
2,Not actually what was avertised,"The DVD looks as if its a reprint of a comic book from the 50's. It is not animation but pictures of the comic book, pictures in 50's style format, in video format."
5,Absolutely Satisfied,I cannot say enough how nice this chime is. Being able to hear it online before buying it was the clincher. My wife loves it too. At times she says it sounds just like someone is playing a real song.
4,"Low pitched, almost perfect wind chimes provide subtle accompaniment","Beautiful chimes. We have owned the Princess version (higher tones) for more than 10 years and they have survived many, many wind storms, blizzards, etc... while bringing lovely accompaniment to the beauty of our surroundings. This Queen Tudor Rose beautifully covers a lower register of sounds. I will mention that one tube of the Queen Tudor Rose (the 5th one) unfortunately produces two tones rather than one pure tone. That tube is a little unpleasant to hear. I asked Woodstock about getting a replacement tube. They are willing to replace the whole set if I return it to them but not able to send a replacement tube. They also informed me that the chimes are no longer made in the US... sorry to hear that."
4,Dad's Birthday present,"My Dad loves these chimes. He actually sits outside on the patio just to listen to them. Gorgeous, melodic tones and I love that all the chimes are based on specific notes from various musical entities, like the Westminster Cathedral or Bach or Tudor romantic songs. Truly beautiful gift."
5,GREAT CLARIFYING SHAMPOO,This stuff works well! Almost too well!It completely breaks down all the excess dirt and oil!I have to be careful because I can completely strip my hair.It smells awesome! And the smell lasts for quite a while :)It's a great shampoo!!!!
1,NOT WORTH ONE STAR,"National Geographic should be ashamed of itself, putting its name on this terrible video. I own many N.G. videos and DVDs; some are interesting, and some are boring. However, none were superficial until this one. This video is only 1/2 hour long, and it consists of 1) a woman's voice trying to sound ominous, and 2) very brief and superficial shots of some reptile predators. This video gives no information on habitat, habits, or even areas where the given reptiles are found. The ""re-enactments"" are so clumsily done that they are laughable.I gave this video one star only because No Stars was not an option. My opinion of N.G. has greatly fallen. DON'T BUY IT !!"
2,really?,"when this book came in the mail, i was less than thrilled... as my husband said, it looks like someone printed that out on their home printer and sent it out.... i would say that the price is a bit high for what you get.the contents of the book are, eh ok. nothing different that i didn't read in any other potty training book. there are some ok tips but nothing that made me feel like i spent my money well. i read the entire book in about 25 minutes, and have been full force potty training my son for over 2 months now, and he is far from ""potty trained""."
3,Packaging Problems,"The gong is great now that I repaired it. The box it was shipped in was open, there was no packing paper to protect it. The leather strings used to hang it were very flimsy, and one of them was broken. I had to replace those, but once I got it hung, it looks great. I would only suggest that the company pack the merchandise a little better."
2,Save your money,"This solution manual only provides answers for every 4th problem. It does not elaborate much either. You're better off just asking your TA. Or hell, you can buy my copy - I'm sending it back."
4,Solutions Manual for Students Vol 1 Chapters 1-21: to Accompany Physics for Scientists and Engineers 4e,Good book for people taking a class requiring it the book. It is a little hard to understand why certain problems are done the way they are. Overall a good book to help you solve problems and determine whether you had the right thought process.
5,Earth Angels,"This was a compelling book which once started I found hard to put down. In between reading I would wonder just what the characters would upto in the next chapter.They had captured me and carried me on a journey of emotions as though I were beside them. An ordinary persons tale, one we can all relate too as a parent or child. Most of all I began to appreciate the great sacrifice that so many made and continue to make in the name of freedom."
4,Excellent storage for your collectible cards,"Great way to store your cards. Box's shipped without any assembly instructions and that's why I rated this 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise, it is an excellent product that you can use to store your large stacks of collectible cards. I recommend this for anyone who collects."
1,Damaged and flimsy.,The product came with a whole corner torn off the lid and the separators are WAY too flimsy for me to use this to hold cards I care about. $11 is way too much to ask fro this product from this dealer.
2,Not very funny,The story was ok. I thought it would be a funny / happy book and was surprised to find out that it was actually quite sad.
3,dragging but ok,The book is a good read however it's a bit dragging and continues on and on about the same thing.
5,Mind Bender,"I loved this book, I highlighted many lines from this book and I will re-read this book many times. It just struck a cord in me personally and I bet a lot of people will feel the same way. Marian knocked it out of the park again with her storytelling. Seriously, buy this book or steal it, but you have to read it!"
4,similar with a surprise,"I enjoyed this book very much. I read everything from Ms. Keyes. I think her writing is easy to read with some romantic overtones. She never fails to entertain. Although, Rachel's Holiday was a bit heavier fare. This book shares some deeper themes than getting fat and finding a man. It had many little surprises and in the end was a great read. You will not be disappointed. The characters are fun as always but carry a bit more depth than some of her other novels."
2,Subject matter was too sad and depressing for me.,Too much grieving. I can't say more without giving away important spoilers. I also did not like the story jumping around using flashbacks.Copyright: 2006. Genre: women's fiction.
3,Not what I expected,"I'm a huge Marian Keyes fan. When I found out she was coming out with a book about Anna I was really excited and couldn't wait to read it. I've liked her other books about the Walsh sisters and figured this one would be on par with the rest, but I quickly found out it wasn't. In the previous books Anna is described as sort of kooky and kind of ""out there"", so when she appears together in this book I found myself thinking that this has got to be someone else and not the Anna of previous books. I felt all of her other books were humorous as well as serious, but I didn't really get that much from this book. If anything, it was just sad and depressing and not what I was expecting from a book about Anna. I won't read this again. It wasn't bad, but just not my cup of tea."
2,Disappointed,"I wanted to like this book because I've read others by M. Keyes that I enjoyed, but I just couldn't get into this one. It felt like a chore trying to get through this book. It was so much longer than it needed to be and I hated all the emails to/from her mom and sister back in Ireland. Those 2 sub-plots were totally useless and not at all entertaining. I also don't recall having even one laugh out loud moment with this book.The one good thing I will say about this book is that it relays a valuable message which is to appreciate what you have and not take things for granted."
2,Boring in second half,I love Marian Keyes but this book I had to put down a little more than halfway through. I loved the first half but the second half was just the same thing over and over and I just wasn't interested anymore. I did not like Helen's PI emailsat all and skipped over them. I just didn't see what it had to do with the story. But all her other books are great and I rushed out the day this came out and I'm sorry to say I was disappointed. But I will continue to read her upcoming novels.
2,a depressing read,"If you enjoyed M. Keyes's previous books, you probably won't like this one. This is what happened to me. The plot of the story is unbearably simple and it will hurt you to realize that it is painfully static. The book was called ""a page turner"": well, may be when you can't believe the fact that the author might go on and on about the same emotional (depressing) state of the main character for chapters, you do start turning those pages. There are several story lines and all of them are either primitive or unrealistically dull. There is no wit or exciting turns of events you will find in Marian Keyes's stories."
2,Don't bother,"This book is an amalgam of: Sex and the City, Bridget Jones Diary, The Devil Wears Prada and P.S. I Love You. You will find all characters from these other books in here. It's as if the author decided to pluck out the best bits from these stories and make her own story out of it. Don't waste your time."
1,boooring,"This book was REALLY boring. I put it down many times so it took me ages to finish and that is only because I like to finish something I start.What was that again about the sister and the mother's emails? Totally irrelevent.This story could have been told in five pages and it still would have been bad, but still better than it is now.I am now too scared to buy any other book written by this author."
2,Not My Style,"I just couldn't get into this book. I felt that the author tried too hard to make the main character appear cute and quirky, and it just didn't work. Sophie Kinsella does it much better."
5,My favourite Marian Keyes book!,"This is definitely not a typical ""chick lit"" book and not even a typical Marian Keyes book but is definitely my favourite. While I was reading it, my husband would say ""What are you laughing at?"" ""Why are you crying?"". I felt like I was really involved in Anna's world. I hope that Marian Keyes continues the Walsh family story, as it was fun to kind out what happens to the other family members and I HAVE to find out what the future holds for Anna."
5,We're Running Out of Walsh Sisters!!,Only Helen's left now! I don't know what I'll do when Marian runs out of Walsh girls!!! Hoprfully she will lead them all on further adventures. This one was the saddest of the lot but just as wonderful to read Marian just keeps honing her craft and getting better and better. I want a sequel to find out when Anna gets her second happy ending!
5,Instant fan!!,"This was my first book by Ms. Keyes, and I loved it! Rarely does a novel move you to feel as much as this one does. Perhaps it's the empathy the author makes you feel.After reading more of her books (of course), I was glad I didn't know Anna before this novel. She seemed much less drifty than described before. I take it Helen's story will be next; I hope she includes a bit about how things turn out for Anna. And I ALWAYS want to read about Rachael and Luke! I strongly recommend this book."
4,A Good Read,"Argh! She made me cry on the last page, and I swore I wasn't going to do that! And with the cheesy butterfly thing, too. Gah.This is, as usual from Marian Keyes, a wonderfully enjoyable book, beautifully written and a good read from start to finish (despite the cheesy butterfly).I cannot WAIT for Helen's book, though."
2,New to Marion Keyes not likely to read her any more,"I got this book for a B&N; Book club called Love and Laughter. Well there was love but not a lot of laughter. Some giggles, lots of tears and not my cup of tea. I did like the mother and the sister that is a PI. I could not connect with the lead character and the first third of the book left me up in the air as to what had happend to the husband.If you are already a Marion Keyes fan and like her other books you will like this one, the quirky characters and the Walsh family are probably true to the rest of the series. It is not a good book for a new Keyes reader and not one to get if you expect to laugh out loud! GG"
2,Good if you want to be depressed,This book made me want to cry the whole way through it. Don't read this if you are looking for a fun chick lit book. not as good as the other marian keyes books. this book made me depressed the whole way through.
2,I agree...,... with a couple of the reviews. I too couldn't finish it. I got almost half was through and lost interest.I've read a few of her other book and enjoyed them.
2,Hated It!,"Wow, I'm the only one who didn't like this one? It was a struggle to read and half way done I put it down and don't intend to pick it up anytime soon. I was really looking forward to more antics from the hilarious Walsh family, but this one is a downer and a slow boat to china. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ............Another question, how did Anna, the pot-head ditz, all of a sudden pull herself together so smartly. This is not the Anna I met in the other books, I just thought her turnaround was sudden and strange."
2,Slow in parts,"While Anna's story was moving. I found the second half of the book to be very slow, and I couldn't wait to finish it to start something better. Helen's substory was too much, and I started skimming over her e-mails. It seems as though Keyes needed something else to carry this book, as I'm not sure Anna's story really deserved that many pages devoted to it. While I've enjoyed Keyes's other novels, this one was definitely my least favorite."
3,You will like it if you are a Keyes fan,"I fell in love with Marian Keyes with 'Last Chance Saloon', 'Rachel's Holiday', 'Sushi for Beginners', etc. Therefore, I bought this one before it even came to paperback. To be honest, a little disappointing. I did not think it was very entertaining, it was very predictable, and as sad as the elements of the story are, I was unable to muster tears. It is not horrible, and if you are a keyes fan go ahead and read it, but if you are new to Marian Keyes, read some of her earlier books first."
4,first time Keyes reader and hooked,"I am not even finished with this book yet but I have to say that Marian Keyes is definitely an author that I look forward to reading again! Her writing at times is like you are talking to your best friend, with extremely humorous sarcasm. Keyes does a great job introducing each character and creating pictures for the reader. When I am finished with this novel, I will be moving on to another Marian Keyes story!"
2,The book's description is pretty much a lie!,"The blurb on the back of this book makes it sound as if it's one of those ""memory-loss"" chick lit tales where the main character goes on a journey to discover what happened before she lost her memory. So when I bought the book and started reading it only to find that this really has nothing to do with her memory loss, but is a story about heart-ache and grieving, I was unpleasantly surprised!If you're looking for something to make you bawl uncontrollably, then buy this book. Perhaps it would also be good for people who are grieving and need some inspiration or someone to relate to.Just be aware that the book's description really does not apply to the story and it is a very heart-breaking story."
3,Too sad for what I expected,"I was really in the mood for a lighthearted chick lit book when I started this one, which was a huge mistake. Marian Keyes is talked about in any sort of chick lit conversation, and I had not read one of her books, so it was time... I picked this one at the library because the little synopsis I read inside the cover said she was in Public Relations, which I think is a fun career to read about. Little did I know I would be nearly in tears the entire book because of the way the events played out.After the ""worst"" part of the book, I expected it to at least pick up a bit for a somewhat happy ending. It WAS happy... at least happier than the beginning, but still not enough to lift my spirits. If I had been in a different mood when I began the book, it's likely I would have enjoyed it (it was well written), but it just did not fit my mood at all. Some of my PaperBackSwap friends have told me I should read Sushi for Beginners next, so that will be the next Keyes I try."
3,light and fun,"I'm a stay at home mom and I love a great chick lit read for when the kids are napping or in bed for the night. This is a fun read and isn't just another ""cookie cutter"" chick lit where the synopsis is always the same."
5,Another great my Marian Keyes,"I love Marian Keyes, especially the books about the Walsh sisters. I was really happy to have one about Anna, the ""flighty"" sister. This book was wonderful: I laughed out loud, and cried. I recommend this to anyone who wants a great book about characters that actually have depth and feeling to them!"
5,An excellent read,"I finished this novel in two days flat, not a tribute to my speed reading technique but to Ms Keyes writing skills. This was well-plotted, suspenseful, sad, hilarious and entertaining all in one! I have read several of Ms Keyes' novels and like this one the best."
4,A story of healing,"This may just be my favorite Marian Keyes book. Most of the characters are familiar yet they are all challenged by the event that changes lives and relationships. I felt myself going through all the emotions of the Walsh family and friends. Pulitzer Prize winning literature, it may not be. But as usual this author teaches us that a sense of humor is an essential ""piece of baggage"" to take on our journey through life. Loved it, loved it, loved it!"
4,Wonderful Escape,"This is the second book I read written by Marian Keyes, the first was Watermelon and from there I fell in love with Keyes' wiriting. Keyes' has published four books regarding the Walsh Sisters: Watermelon, Anybody Out There, Rachel's Holiday and Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married - these books have became my Summer 2008 reads. Anybody Out There in particular is a delight - you will not be disappointed - it's funny, real and a great escape from your day-to-day life."
2,I really wanted to like this book....but....,"Historically I have loved all of Marian Keye's books. I heart you Marian! So when I saw this book, in hardback, at the airport book store I snapped up. It started off OK but I just couldn't get into it. For those who have read her previous works that feature these characters....they just don't seem the same. Additionally this book is just a downer, which wouldn't ordinarily bother me, if the book was more interesting. This book was definitely not my favorite."
3,It was ok,"I love Marian Keyes, but by this book, the Walsh sisters are starting to feel forced. This book was not very believable, which I'm sure is fine for some, but for me it didn't ring with her usual charm. Still worth a read, though."
1,Anybody out there,"Could not get in to story, jumped around so much, worse book I have tried to read."
1,Good Grief,"If this had any more sloppy emotion it would curdle your soup. Wow, what's the deal out there? This is why men can't take women seriously. Wow."
4,Another Boise Reader,"Another reviewer described this book as one he/she ""could not put down."" Hmmmm....I didn't have that experience. However, two years after reading the book I still vividly remember Harlan, Erlan and Elizabeth and their strange, or strangely quiet?, lives. I recommend the book not for page-turning urgency or edge-of-the seat excitement but for quality characterizations and quiet energy. Give it a try! I'm buying a second copy today as a gift, and I'm not an easy sale."
4,a good read for everyone,I love this book! It's a short novel about two brothers having to make it on their own when their parents pass away. They're both different people and both representative of many of us in one sense or another. I couldn't put the book down. The lives of these two men have much to say to each of us about our own.
1,Thank god the store took this one back,Terrible. I didn't hear a single good song on it. Thank god the store took it back and gave me back my mone
5,Best practical advise for novelists,"Hands down one of the best books on writing and creating a writing life that I've read (and I've read a lot of them!) Well worth the investment to get the paperback version so you can highlight, post-it note and dog-ear to your hearts content!"
5,"Guarantee this will make you want to write, and it'll make you laugh!","""Think about the things that put you on the moral high ground. If your dead set against fast food or red meat or oral sex or shaving your legs or hard liquor or bad language, you might just want to go ahead and give some of that a shot. Just to see what it feels like."" -from the book.Filled with some of the best writing advice I've ever read, this book will inspire you, and besides that, its so insanely funny! I just love this woman! I have had this book for several years, and recently took it off the shelf to read again, and once again, I just couldn't put it down.I just don't know how anyone could write more real than this. Not only does she offer superb writing advice, but some darned good advice about other areas of life as well."
1,Grateful she was not my teacher,"I must confer with the readers who were seriously turned off by this book. I hastily purchased it as a possibility for a writing class I was offering , thinking it would be in a league with Lamont, N Goldberg, S King, and others who have given so much of themselves to help fledging writers. I fear Ms. See's nasty brand of negativity and her humor based on humiliation and put downs made me wonder what is wrong with the woman.Too revealing about her own dark psyche and very little to truly encourage new writers."
1,What a Waste,"...Carolyn See begins her book with this quote from a fellow professor: ""Carolyn cares more about the writing life than she does about writing."" Amazing how on target that professor was. [the book is] ""silly in places"" and it is--I'd add that it's also crude and vulgar in lots of places, and for no apparent reason. Ms. See enjoys throwing around the ""f"" word, the ""s"" word and demeaning descriptions of sex (what that has to do with making a literary life is never explained)..."
2,"Please follow your own advice, Mrs. See.","Fortunately this book does have good information, put in a pithy, readable format with a certain amount of witty aplomb. This makes up for the author's glaring vanity.Also, for a person who incessantly reiterates the imporance of being charming, well-mannered, pleasant and courteous toward readers and everyone else, it's sad to see her fall into the almost de rigeur practice of almost any writer today: bashing Christianity.There are a dozen or so completely unnecessary negative analogies to the Christian faith, and a few cases of really sacriligeous and offensive statements. This is done in her breezy, nonchalant manner, but really, it detracts from her otherwise original style."
2,"A fun gossip, but light on advice","Carolyn See has a fine time dropping names and filling us in on the wacky childhood that led her to be a writer. She's good at these things, although she could have skipped some of the gossip about celeb writers. The 'euww' factor definitely comes into play.If you're a beginning writer looking for advice, skip this book and move on to Stephen King's 'On Writing', Donald Maass' 'Writing the Breakout Novel', or Blake Snyder's 'Save the Cat'. These are all finely written books that not only fire your blood to write, write, write, but are rich in detailed advice that you can use.By the time See gets to the advice, she seems bored. She does wisely emphasize courtesy as a watchword with which to begin ones career.Take the title literally; See is speaking to writers who want to write the literary novel. She sneers at her father's choice of writing mystery novels, and this book is dated enough that the ebook publishing explosion is not even addressed."
3,Just another gimmick,"This pricey piece a cheese may work for some, but there are those of us who KNOW that grana tastes best SHAVED. Thats the way you can dip pieces of grana in Balsamic or Saba and faint with pleasure.In addition, this product sells for $7 something at Trader Joe. and at that price, i would keep one on hand, knowing that my preference for shaved would make the grater grana last almost forever!"
5,From stove to table-Perfect!!,"You will be writting a positive review once you try this cheese! Grates fine for sprinkling on your Italian favorites or salads etc. You won't be sorry, unless you don't try this product. It even comes with it's own grater! Come on-order, try, then write your own review and smile!"
3,2007 R1 (Warner) DVD exactly same as 1998 R1 (MGM) DVD,"I was silly enough to purchase the 2007 region-1 DVD, hoping to get a new transfer of the film (the one used for the Blu-ray with the same cover published at about the same time). I have uploaded three screenshots for comparison. They clearly show that the 1998 and 2007 DVD are identical (incidentally the screenshots have the exact same file size); the R2 DVD (the only one I will keep) is taken from the same transfer but the image is much sharper and shows a bit more information on the right and left. Maybe some of the more technical-minded will find this interesting."
1,Just horrible.,"For a student who is just learning mathematical proofs, this book is just horrible. The examples are awful and the author shortcuts many proofs. For example only part of a proof is proven. Not only that, when giving the answer to a problem, instead of writing out the reason to why, it's just a one worded sentence. I'm in a class with about 20 students and we all agree this is probably one of the worst mathematical reasoning book out there. We got more help from using online resources then the book. For someone out there who knows the material then this book is a good review but for people learning the material do not get this book."
5,Very well written book,"I have a mathematics degree. Like most math majors, I struggled with proofs all through college. This book really has help me understand the art of writing proofs. The book is very well written and easy to read. This is just an awesome book!!!"
5,Very Nice Sound and Appearance,"The chime is ready to hang right out of the box. It is attractive, and it provides soothing tones with a breeze. My only disappointment was that I was somehow expecting this to be American-made. It was not."
1,Does not chime,"Was excited about my order of the wind chimes until I hung them up on the corner of my house. They do not chime. I have other chimes that sound beautifully. I believe the wooden section that sounds the chimes is too heavy. Unfortunately, I waited to long and missed the return window. Please do not order; you be disappointed."
5,Worth the extra money,Bought for my wife for her birthday. Seems so far to be made of quality material with a very pleasant sound unlike most cheaper versions. Worth the extra money.
5,Amazing!,"These chimes are spectacular, the sound is clear and precise, and they are simply a joy to hear! Don't hesitate to buy Woodstock Chimes, they are truly wonderful."
1,String breaks within months,"No question that the chimes sound wonderful. I was pleased by both of the ones we got when we purchased our new home. But beware - the strings are NOT adequate and break easily - we lost one to a string snapping. The workmanship is poor and the strings became unattached from the staples in another. Note that while the tuning is guaranteed, the shoddy materials and workmanship are not. Very expensive given the products broke within a few months."
5,Love the smooth and calming sound,I love the sounds that come when the wind blows. I have it placed in my front porch and the sounds get transported all over my neighborhood. love it!
4,Comentario del prof. González Vázquez,"Se trata de un libro clásico, imprescindible en un primer acercamiento a la perspectiva del análisis económico del derecho de sociedades."
3,The Stars say It All,"The book is OK...nothing outstanding...at least for someone who is very experienced at sewing clothing. The styles included are very basic and although they can be adapted the examples are outdated and were not very inspiring to me. For someone who has never attempted to construct a garment wthout using a pattern, this might be a helpful booklet. The price is reasonable."
5,"Learn to 'think' like a trout, with the help of Brian Clarke","Excellent insight into the ways of the trout, and the environment in which the trout thrives. Where to find trout under different circumstances, but most of all actually showing you why and how the trout reacts to different stimuli like light, heat, sound, chemistry etc. etc."
3,Light reading for beginning chapter book readers,"It's difficult not to like this light-hearted, fun story, even if the characters seem a bit anemic and the plot a bit dull and predictable. In the eyes of 2nd - 4th grade readers, however, this book is likely 'just right.' It's suspenseful, but not scary; intricate, but not boggling; fanciful, but not hard-to-relate-to. It's a nice change from the typical early reader books and a good book for the transition to more involved chapter books. The book, the second of a 4-part series, is O.K. for a stand-alone. One nice thing about this book was that it showed a young girl dealing with challenges in a positive way and learning from her foibles; there is always a need for more books with messages like this."
5,Little Genie: Double Trouble,"Great Series!! I am so thrilled ...my 7 1/2 year old just finished this book, and to quote her, ""It was soooo good!"" My daughter hasn't been very interested in reading for pleasure until she discovered THIS series. She spent TWO hours reading last night because she just couldn't put it down. I will be running right out tomorrow to get the third book in the series. Thanks Miranda Jones."
1,No instructions and not compatible with Ericsson,This product comes with no instructions. I went to many cell phone outlets and none could plug it my cell phones (Ericsson and Nokia). I wasn't able to find the web site for the manufacturer. Buying this product is a visit to a post office for return of this product back to Amazon.
4,DVORAK is the key to speed!,"From the outside, it may seem like it may be harder to learn, or even harder to find a Dvorak keyboard. But once you get the hang of it, there is no turning back."
4,Nice Collection of Classic Movies,"I purchased this collection because I love watching old movies from the 1940's and 50's. I bought this collection after I bought the 100 Mystery Classics collection which is also distributed by Mill Creek. My only complaint is that this distributor puts some of the same movies on different collections. This Fabulous Forties collection had a few of the same movies that were on the Mystery Classics collection that I had just finished watching. Therefore, before you purchase any movie collection, please check the titles to be sure you aren't purchasing the same movies. Overall, the sound and picture quality in this collection was pretty good. If you're a fan of old movie classics, I would recommend this collection. Just be sure it doesn't contain movies that you already own."
3,Quite fair,"At first appearance the movies shown appear mediocre, but the first four discs which I have watched so far are quite acceptable"
3,Doll does not look at all like the picture on the box,"I too was disappointed in the actual doll compared to the picture on the box. Hoever, I have noticed that on many of the high end Barbie Dolls the pictures look much better than the actual dolls. It would have been nice if her hair was not pulled back tight on the doll and actually flowed around her face as in the original picture representing the doll. Now that would have made for a beautiful doll! The chocolate scent is nice but over the years will fade and this will just be another gimmick. All in all - as a colectible - she could have been prettier."
5,Silver Label Barbie - Smells great & is beautiful!!,"Flavor Obsession -silver label 2005:Rich. Delectable. Intoxicating. The complex flavor of chocolate evokes passion and inspires complete devotion. Chocolate Obsession(tm) Barbie doll celebrates the tradition of chocolate as the perfect gift. Scented with the sweet sumptuous smell of chocolate, Barbie doll wears a lovely gown of cocoa brown with glamorous full-length shawl and impressive golden earrings. A beautiful tribute to a favorite fixation!"
5,had it for years,Ive kept it in the box for years and it STILL smells like chocolate. its very pretty pictures dont do it justice
4,Great for ELLs,"This dictionary is primarily intended for people who are beginning to learn the English language - a.k.a. ELLs (English Language Learners). Few things are more frustrating than to look up a word only to find that you've never seen half of the words in the definition. I have tried to use various ""basic,"" ""children's"" and ""school"" dictionaries with my students, but even these have many, many incomprehensible definitions. This is by far the best I've seen. The other reviewer is right - a lot of words are missing, but this dictionary still has more entries than most of this type, and, Hallelujah, my kids can understand the definitions. It serves to bridge the gap between picture dictionaries and typical school dictionares. If she feels that this dictionary is not extensive enough for her daughter's middle school homework, she may want to try the intermediate version of this series or a ""school"" dictionary."
3,"Biased, but thought provoking","I found little or no facts in the book, mostly biased opinions. Some facts were totally off: Rav Nachman was from Breslav, not Bratislav; Trotsky made no effort to save the Jews from pogroms, etc..."
4,thankful,"Came much smaller than I thought. For people like me who don't get a chance to visit the Augusta golf course in person, I'm thankful there's such product."
1,The Gong Show Gang of Heldentenors,"This is among the most awful example of ""singing"" I ever heard. JaquesUrlus is an exception- he had a wonderful voice and sang excellently. Some are tolerable at best.These guys bark, snort, scream and wail. They sound like they are hanging from a noose. They have ugly voices which they make worse by barbaric singing technique and style.At best, this is a party record for laughs only [a la] Florence Foster Jenkins. Anyone who criticized Lauritz Melchior for anything, ought to be tied to a chair and forced to hear this disc for several hours."
2,Meh,"Most of it had very little to do with the Friars. Lots of history. Some parts interesting, other parts I skipped over."
2,Wildly disappointing and uninteresting,"Only gave it an extra star for it's clever name. Chances are I haven't done enough drugs to get on the same wavelength as this, and I hope I never do. If you're straight, this'll sound like someone stuffed the Jesus and Mary Chain in a closet. If this is transcendent, then I'm ending my quest to break on though right now."
4,GOOD PRODUCT!,"Leather case very fragile -- can't really carry it on belt without it breaking. Really sharp and long, kind of like a dagger -- COOL! I like these and they were affordable."
4,Buried Treasure,"I'd never even heard of this movie before a friend mentioned it a few months ago. It's like ""Easy Rider"" meets ""Blue Velvet."" A strange, moody movie that gets under my skin."
4,Be seduced.,"While maintaining the blazing heat factor, seasoned Harlequin author Jamie Denton has penned a textured romance with heart and fuses it with intricate suspense. Seduced by the Enemy focuses on Jared Romine, rogue ex-FBI who is linked to the murder of his partner Jack Dysert and aide to hot-shot senator Martin Phipps. When Peyton Douglas, his cherished ex-flames gets embroiled in a scam to suggest that she is fraudulent of pocketing the money that Jared was rumoured to have taken, he steps in after a 3-year hiding to save both of their lives. Passion sears between the lovers but it is the exquisite tenderness that makes this romance exceptional. Peyton braves through a thwarted pregnancy and wrestles with mistrust, insecurity and a proposal from an amorous suitor when she obviously has feelings for Jared. There is passion and complexed emotions which touches real feelings. Despite the hot melting sex, it is Denton's sincere characters that makes this short read devastating in its scale."
1,blaze?,I gave this book one star since it had no business in the blaze series. It was boring. Characters were lifeless and insipid.
1,Tofu with PORK... Tofu with BEEF...,"Is it me? Or does one generally assume - unless it states otherwise - that a tofu cookbook will be vegetarian? Sorry, but I'm returning this one."
2,Two strikes,"Great idea for an antenna, but I give it two strikes. It says that it comes with a connection kit, but the documentation assumes you already have a way to connect the (coaxial?) cable to your phone. There is no connection kit included. The only parts included are the sticker to attach it to your windshield, a small packet of glass cleaner and one page of instructions. According to the manufacturer's Web site, if you try to remove the antenna after installation, you destroy the antenna. For now, I'd say it's better to risk someone ripping off your external antenna then taking a chance that this permanently mounted antenna will be compatible with your next phone."
4,Great alternative to an external antenna,"After investigating a large number of options, I chose this antenna over an external one for a stealth installation. The antenna comes with a long enough coaxial cable, and the cable is terminated with a mini-UHF plug that fits into the antenna end of the Nokia 61xx complete car kit. Perfect! No other cables or adapters were necessary in my case. I installed the antenna only recently, but so far the reception has been great with no dropped calls while driving around town.The price is right, no wind noise from an external antenna, and almost invisible installation on the rear window. Overall, it's a great product that is perfectly functional. I knocked off one star because of the sparsity of instructions, especially the complete lack of technical specification. Andrew's web site isn't particularly helpful, either."
5,"""Influential"" says President Barack Obama","You will be drawn into this in-depth look at people and personalities, including four rivals, in President Lincoln's cabinet. It is not a biography although it contains details about the four men's and Lincoln's earlier years leading up to the election and the post-election periods. The book concentrates on the mechanics of 1860 campaigning, government and governance.President Obama cited it as one of his favorite books, and you can see why. Democrat or Republican, if your interests include politics or history, you'll be fascinated by this exhaustively researched and readable account of President Lincoln and the people surrounding him."
5,so good,"One of the best biographies I have ever read. Though not a very spiritual person, I truly believe that Abraham Lincoln was put here for a reason. Ms. Goodwin brings him to life more than anyone else I have read....even Mr. Donald. I read his book and it came and went. Ms. Goodwin's will never leave me. He is what a president should be. He was a one in a million kind of person. Her book is genius. He is unforgettable."
2,Not what I wanted,"The ease of the internet got me as I was in a hurry and clicked too soon. I was looking for the actual book published several years ago. Instead, I purchased a book, based on a movie, which was based on a dang book. Who needs that?"
3,So hard to get through!,"This book is well researched, very thorough, but for anyone with a passable amount of American History knowledge rather redundant, and long. It isn't as bad as it looks because it has tons of citations and notes at the end."
5,One of the most moving books I have ever read,"Almost everyone knows of Abraham Lincoln and his leadership during America's struggle to eradicate slavery and maintain the union. However this books delves deeply into LIncoln's unique blend of emotional and intellectual intelligence. It brings to life the love that this formidable man had for his country, democracy and mankind. It is a book that anyone who is becoming cynical with western democracy or who is in a position of leadership should read. By the end of the book I was in tears as Goodwin tenderly covered the last few hours of Lincoln's life, but at the same time I was re-energised by the hope that democracy, under the leadership of great, compassionate people, does and will prevail."
5,Lincoln from many first-hand perspectives...,"I'm relishing going through this mighty tome 2 pages a night... taking my time... reading slowly... The recent movie was based on only a small portion of the book, but because I enjoyed the movie the book characters are coming more alive for me... The movie tie-in only gives you the cover shot of Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln—but the price is right."
4,Team of Rivals,"""Team of Rivals"" had much new information. and good comparisons of all the players. It is highly recommended as a companion to the new Lincoln movie."
5,Excellent,"I am really enjoying this book, so much information about day to day events and decisions, comfirming what a great man Lincoln was."
5,Phenomenal book,"I am learning so much about this great country and incredible man! Goodwin writes so eloquently, and her research is incredibly comprehensive."
5,Excellent!,Should be a must-read in school - excellent history lesson and insight to the great men of the era. Doris Kearns Goodwin never disappoints.
3,Team of Rivals,"It is a book for history buffs. For many readers (including me) the overall meaning is somewhat lost in the mass of sometimes what seems to be irrelevant detail. The genius of Lincoln's ability to bring people together, to cajole rather than bully, to make compromises with the goal of ""overall"" good and sometimes lost in the plethora of details.The book is very worthwhile as a resource and also as a novel, but could beneift from careful ""pruning""."
4,Nice guy saved by Grant,"Good, informative book.However, all of the praise we heap upon Lincoln would not exist if not for Grant. Lincoln passively accepted poor general after poor general until the country was practically bled white.Only with the entrance of Grant (and Sherman), and their hard bitten, stern methods on the battlefield (winning) did Lincoln come around the glory he has today.If not for Grant, willing to kill as many as it takes (regardless of losses), Lincoln would be viewed today as a total failure.Don't take my word for it, read the book."
4,Good historical perspective,I really enjoyed the way she approached Lincoln and his team. Our country could use a real leader like this today. Someone who can unite those around him and not get involved in petty disputes.
4,Impressive research,"A long, detailed account of Lincoln's political career. I found this book very helpful in understanding the underpinnings of the Civil War."
4,Lincoln,An interesting approach to an iconic man. The view gives an interesting view into the who and why of Lincoln.
5,OUTSTANDING BOOK!,"If you want to know more about the life of Lincoln, this is the one book you must read. Awesome!"
5,Must read!,Team of Rival is well written and researched to my knowledge. Very readable in the sense it isn't academic.I highly recc it to anyone interested in this seminal figure in our history as a nation.
5,Great Book,"I am very pleased with all facets of this order. Although a problem was experienced with the initial shipment, the shipper quickly made corrections at no cost to me. I am very satisfied."
5,Riveting examination of Lincoln's Humanity and Authority,"For anyone who really wants to know all about Abraham Lincoln this is an invaluable book. It starts by exploring the early life of Abraham Lincoln and his rivals for the presidential nomination, showing how each of them matured and responded to their early lifes.Again and again it's clear that we have all been blessed by this man who was driven by his desire to leave an impression on the word. This book shows both the trials and the triumphs that Lincoln passed through on his way to the presidency. His greatness was partly because he could explain complex concepts in language that was accessible to his entire audience, at that stage mostly rural Americans.At the same time, the anecdotes of Lincoln receiving news in his night gown, or being woken to hear both good and bad news really show us the human side of Lincoln.It's a substantial book (700+) pages, but it ended far too quickly for me."
2,cover torn,I bought it as a gift; cover was torn when it arrived. I bought a different copy from a local book store.
3,"Good overview, but true insight into Lincoln, I'd stick with a real historian","Kearns review of Lincoln's political wheelings and dealings is a good overview of what a political genius Lincoln was, but I felt it didn't give a true portrayal of the entire man. I found that Lincoln is a complex figure with many different layers, and I didn't feel I got that from reading this. For a better overview into the complete Lincoln, I'd suggest you read ""101 Things You Didn't Know About Lincoln: Loves And Losses! Political Power Plays! White House Hauntings!"" by Brian Thornton. Thornton's done his homework on this one, and I found out many things about the man I never knew, which surprised me since I had considered myself somewhat of a Lincoln historian myself."
3,historical snafu undermines historical veracity,"Over all the book presented a good and important picture of Lincoln, not emphasized in other biographies. However to have Lee surrendering to Grant at THE Appomatox Courthouse, instead of the McClean House at Appomatox Court House, VA is a mistake no Civil War historian should make. Hopefully it was a proof readers doings."
1,Not Loanable Policy,"I would have purchased this book, but my policy is not to buy anything which is not loanable. It's outrageous to pay the same for ebooks as paperbacks, and not being able to loan them."
1,Lincoln book,Bought book for my husband who is interested in Lincoln but not into politics. Book was returned as a result.
1,Kindle price more than paperback price - really???,Here is another book that I will not be purchasing for my Kindle until the publishers decide to price it appropriately. I find it hard to believe that it is more expensive to send me an electronic version than it is to produce and distribute a hard copy of the book. Do publishers just not want business from Kindle users??
1,No unabridged audio version.,"Who in their right mind would buy an abridged audio version of any book. The lack of an unbridged version makes this a ""don't buy"" for me. The print version is fine but I'd like a ""real"" audio version for travel not some fake thing!"
4,Team of rivals,Excellent! I saw the movie which was very good but so much was left out that I don't know how they decided which events to focus on. The background of the key characters is wonderful. This is a book I'm sure to read again.
5,A Must Read For History Buffs and Lincoln Lovers,"While reading , you feel as if you are there in the 1800's. Lincoln's demeanor,intensity, brilliance, and sensitivity are all felt by the reader. An excellent read."
4,Great Book,This is a must read for anyone that likes biographies! It is a great depiction of the story and it is well written. Recommended!
3,"Everything I Learned, I Learned From David Herbert Donald","I had such high hopes for ""Team of Rivals"". What a combo: Old Abe and Moptop (read DKG's memoir ""Wait ""til Next Year!""). Alas, ""Team of Rivals"" does not add much to the Lincoln canon. Donald's biography remains definitive. While DKG starts out strong, the subject and source material appear to overwhelm her. Wait 'til the next book, Ragmop!"
2,Trite,"Pap. This book has the ambitious title, ""Team of Rivals"", but the concept is never effectively explored. The reader moves from one snippet of historical theater to another driven by the imagineering of DKG. Each new ""Stage"" the on which the reader finds themselves, the author has imagined what must be going through everyone's mind, what the weather is like, what they are doing (with ever more droll degrees of banality), and its all nothing more than supposition. This book reads more like a historical fiction novel, which is what the author ought to be writing instead. I don't wanna hear that 'Mary Todd looked splendid in her yellow Summer dress that day' (didnt look up the exact quote, not going to), something RELEVANT to the theme of the book would be nice, not some made up nonsense. What if someone thought she looked frumpy? Would it even matter? Could we move on to something important please?"
2,Historical pandering,Goodwin sees history through her own prism. She depicts history to conform to her preconceived notions and to preserve her progressive perspective.
1,team of rivals is flawed,The book looks at three rivals who sort of worked together in the end. The book fails to address Lincolns disasterous decisions with the rest of his cabinet and the generals he selected. The cost of the war in terms of money and humanity due to his inability to select a proper set of generals while trying to appease everyone made the war last about 3 years longer than it ever had to considering all the advantages the north had.If Linconls philosophy was to have a team of rivals it nearly destroyed the nation. Here's hoping Obama actually rereads his history and doesn't take too much away from this book he claims to love without knowing....the rest of the story.
1,Doris' House in the Hamptons Book,"Buy this book only if you want to contribute to Doris' effort to buy a house in the Hamptons. There is almost nothing new in this book. Not quite [...], it very closely follows the detailed works of Catton, Sandburg and Foote.Her attention to the battles of the Civil War is embarrassingly scant. Doris does however excel in the re-retelling of little personal tidbits and petty gossip concerning Lincoln and those around him-great and small.THIS OVERRATED BOOK IS NOT A BOOK FOR THE SERIOUS CIVIL WAR OR LINCOLN SCHOLAR."
1,Garbage,"The author of this book really just plays to modern definitions of political correctness without any original insight or sources. Most of what is in her book can be gotten from other sources. Moreover, it is essentially a superficial treatment of Lincoln. There are better books than this one."
2,Team of Rivals,"I sent the book for a birthday present. All indications were that it would get there ""before"" the birthday date. After the fact I received an email from the third party that she does not check her email often and that the book just went out - well after the birthday arrival date.So I am not too impressed with the third party situation here. Also did not realize it was being sent by a third party so I do not know what went wrong."
5,Best Book in 30 Years,"This book should be on the ""must read"" list for anyone who is either in a position of leadership, or would like to be. Having read this book I could completely understand how people make it their life's work, being a Lincoln scholar. While many have written of Lincoln, this author gives equal coverage to those critical to the success of his efforts, those who were so assured that they would be the presidencial nominee, that they did not even attend the convention. To learn how to work effectively with those who we may not necessarily like, is a lesson this country could stand to learn...quickly!"
4,Timely & Well-Written,"Doris Kearns Goodwin has done a very nice job putting you in a time that most of us are unfamiliar. If you think we have problems now, read this book, and what we're going through as a country feels like a walk in the park.The author has done a particularly good job of capturing who the people that would serve Lincoln are. It would have been easy to write about Lincoln himself, but with whom he decided to surround himself tells us much more about the man. In doing so, Goodwin has written the backstories of all the major players: their roots, their wives, important friendships and associations, and most importantly, their egoes. It's hard to imagine assembling these people together and getting them on the same page. In showing us the depths of these people, Goodwin has shown us why Lincoln should be remembered as a great man and a great President.A must read!"
2,Too Detailed,"This is the most detailed book i have ever read. The minute character descriptions and the shear number of these descriptions pulls the reader off the main theme of the book so often that one tends to become lost. I pushed thru the entire book, but it was not a rewarding read"
4,Extremely detailed,"Very interesting book. Gives a lot of insight into the era leading up to Lincoln's preidency and the presidency itself. Though I found the book very enlightening, the one drawback I had was what seemed to me an over abundance of details in each of the men's lives. I know the author wanted to let the readers almost know these men personally from the writings but at times the story seemed to drag and I found myself wanting to skip forward to get on with the story. Still I think it was very worthwhile reading especially to history buffs."
4,"Well-researched, well-written","There seems to be an abundance of books out there on Abe Lincoln. However, this is the only book I saw that thoroughly detailed both him and his cabinet. Overall, I'm impressed with Ms. Goodwin's writing abilities. From what I can tell, and from what I've heard from another historian, she is tops in her field. Though a bit too detailed, this book is an excellent source of facts and stories surrounding President Lincoln and his ""Team of Rivals"". 4-Stars."
5,Great book,"Half way through it, but it is very well researched and written, plus a good story telling. I do recommend it!"
5,Very good book on Lincoln. Well-written!,A well-written account of Lincoln. Team of Rivals deserves its many good reviews!I definately recommend for anyone who loves reading Lincoln books.
5,Lively discussion group help,I've always been a Doris Kearns Goodwin fan. I think she's thoughtful and not excitable...good traits in today's world. Our book club enjoyed the discussion so much we continued the discussion to include next month too. Intriguing approach to governing...
4,Must Read ...,"Awe inspiring narrative of Lincoln and the approach he took to working with generally the best people he could gather around him ... highly recommend. Would have given 5 starts ... although well written and engaging I still measure all historical biographies against those written by Chernow ... comes close, but Chernow's books are the best writing (for me anyways)."
4,Smart man,The slant of this book on Lincoln tells alot about our sixteenth president. He surrounded himself with the people who ran against him in politics. No yes people for thid guy. Incredible amount of research and work writing this historic story of these incredible times. Connecting the historic dots of the people and events opens your eyes to decisions and plots surrounding the man.
4,Team of Rivels: A Review,"I am only a couple of chapters into this book by Doris Kearns Goodwin, but already I know I like it. If a book captivates my interest in a couple of chapters, then it is worth reading. Mrs. Goodwin seems to have a similiar talent to that of David McCullough: they know how to bring long dead imporant people, back to life, back to the flesh and blood, the good qualities and the flaws, of their long-dead selves. It is excellent so far."
4,Great insight to our history,"Not completely through book, but it is providing insight into a very important about our history, I had never heard before. I had always heard about the criticism about McClellan, but never realized extent of his cowardice and self serving ways. That fact that Lincoln and his cabinet put up with him, reveal how weak the Union side was in military leadership. The loss of Lee to the south, was devastating."
5,Excellent,"Really good history, and a very enjoyable read. I feel I will now be better prepared to watch to movie ""Lincoln"" ."
3,MIXED YET WORTHY,This is an interesting interplay of the narratives that surrounded and may be compared to the narrative of the life of Lincoln. It is an interesting approach; but at times tends to be tedious in the reading. At other times there are insights and snipits of history that make the effort a worthy one.
3,Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,"Don't know when I will finish it because it is lengthy. It isn't holding my interest as much as I would like it to do. Very informative about the time and includes very detailed biographical information on this team of rivals. Haven't gotten to read about the genius of President Lincoln yet. I know I have to reach much much more to properly critique it. However, I saw the movie Lincoln and loved it."
5,Great Book for history buffs.,"Since the movie, Lincoln, was released and everyone seems to think it's a fab movie, this book was a good companion to the movie. Bought it for my husband who is an American history buff and he is singing its praises."
2,Doesn't live up to its title,"The book is very well written and the writer is--of course--extremely reliable. My only complaint is that it's not what it claims to be. I was expecting an in-depth report on how Lincoln molded this group of men into a real team--sort of a ""Lincoln on Leadership,"" for the 21st century. I was hoping for all kinds of insights and practical, homespun wisdom. But instead it was simply a history of his administration. So in spite of how well written and thoroughly researched it was, I was disappointed."
5,Are you People Crazy?,"People, Come on, Lincoln was most certainly not a murderous tyrant or a dictator. He was a great man and the best president this country has ever seen. This is an excellent book."
4,team of rivals,"great look at the inner workings of the executive branch This cabinet was hardly a ""team"". In comparison to the way cabinets members are selelected in our era of political, Lincoln showed incredible political courage to select this group."
5,For the love of history,"I loved this book. Doris Kearns Goodwin is an excellent writer, she did 10 years of research before writing this book. She makes you feel as if you are there. You find out what a brilliant man Lincoln was and how he surrounded himself with men who were not always his strongest supporters. I did not want it to end."
5,"An excellent, lively account of a critical period in American history","This is an amazing book. It combines the lively chronological history of a vital period in American history with a splendid style which affords the reader accountability and honesty. Mr. Lincoln, his wife, his colleagues and his adversaries are brought to life in a manner which places the reader in that space of life which seems almost as today. The inevitable comparisons of Mr. Lincoln with other presidents leaves him at the very top. The detailed history adds to one's understanding of how we moved through that difficult period."
1,You MUST be kidding!,"This is simply another white wash from the Lincoln cultists of the most despicable man to ever be President. In her typical fashion Goodwin once again ignores the truth, as she has in all of her previous books, and elevates a tyrant to god-like levels. This has become her method of operation that now serves to produce nothing more than propaganda. I found this book to be nothing more than a ""How to be a Dictator"" manual. Goodwin should be ashamed of herself for attempting to beatify America's first emperor! Why anyone would admire the man who destroyed our republic is beyond me!"
4,Team of Rivals,"Interesting, illuminating to those of us with little understanding of that part of history - thanks Doris we need more historians like you."
5,EXCELLENT READ!!!!!!,Reads like a very well written novel. I can see why Doris Kearns Goodwin previously won the Pulitzer. She truly makes Lincoln and his colleagues come alive. What a great human being he was. No wonder Obama values this history. There is much to learn from Lincoln's wisdom and humanity.
5,I could not wait to get im my car !,The audio book was everything and more than I could have expected from the writing and the narration. I could not wait everyday to get in my truck to listen to this incredible story and now I can't wait to start listening again.
5,Team of Rivals,I wish I learned 1/2 of what Ms. Goodwin wrote about in high school history. Abraham Lincoln is someone who we all should learn from. Oh to have a man like him today be part of the political landscape along with F.D.R.*Bravo & Kudos to Doris Kearns Goodwin
4,Not bad- but not up to the hype,Good writing- but not really up to the hype you may have heard due to Obama's path of late.
5,The Best Book Ever,"Honestly, I consider this to be the best book I ever read. The total picture of Lincoln's political life and an insight into other facets of his life, also, make the reader understand how this genius maintained control of his surroundings, maneuvered in and out countless political and battlefield disasters. I'd never understood the Civil War well, even having toured Gettysburg iteslf, and reading Goodwin's decsriptions opened my eyes to exactly why things happened as they did. 'Not one bit boring as one might expect an historical book to be at all.................Utterly fascinating and riveting."
5,"To understand anything about the Civil War, you must read this book!","I learned more about the people, events, and effects of the Civil War from Team of Rivals, than I ever did having college degrees in the history of the United States! It is as easy to read and as beautiful as any prose, and the brilliance and passion of Abraham Lincoln leaps off of the pages. The movie, Lincoln, is based only on a very small portion of the book, and reading the massive volume is like watching 100 movies! To understand modern American life, and modern American politics, it is incumbent upon everyone to read Team of Rivals. The loss of Lincoln in America's future after the Civil War, becomes astoundingly clear."
4,Team of Rivals by Goodcwin,"I enjyoed the book and its good history facts. Maybe I missed when he did the emacipitation procerss.I brought me right into the time. Good facts and isights,'I would recommend it."
4,Yes Indeed,This book is still resting on the shelf nearby waiting for me to read it. I just have to finish my other reading projects first
5,A book that could turn anyone into a fan of history,"Kearns tells Lincoln's story by focusing not only on him, but on the individuals and setttings that helped to shape him andn his ideas throughout his political career. It's a must read for anyone who loves American history and a great entre into biography for those who are not yet fans of this genre or of history in general"
4,A Good History Text,This book is written in history text style but is in general more compeliing than most texts. It's an interesting story of a leader who was wise enough not to surround himself with snycophants.
5,Savor It,"I have never reviewed a book, but this one is worth a little time. Doris Kearns Goodwin examined so many authentic documents and letters to create this well conceived work of nonfiction. The gems she chose to include had me highlighting often. I started to read the book in paperback (Costco purchase). It wasn't long before I downloaded it onto my Kindle for a few reasons. First, I was finding a considerable amount of words that I chose to have defined. Second, I wanted to easily highlight the jewels of wisdom. Third, I was going on a trip and wanted to reduce bulk. It's long, but deserves to be read slowly. I truly appreciated this fine work and will read others by this author."
5,Must read,"Great book. Goodwin is a captivating writer, who makes the inner workings of Lincoln's cabinet an interesting read. She is my favorite presidential biographer and this is one of her best books."
4,Another aspect of the Civil War,"I thought the book was a comfortable read for being so detailed in the lives of the rivals. I learned more of the details of the attempted assignation of Seward, who was forward thinking enough to purchase Alaska. I have a book of some of the speeches given by Lincoln which I could refer to when they were suggested in the ""Team of Rivals"". This in gave me a broader view of Lincoln's thinking and enhanced the book. In the book of speeches of Lincoln's is a speech on the Missouri Compromise and Lincoln's clear statement on the history of the compromise helped showed Lincoln's thought process. The ""Team of Rivals"" helps everyone to see the true character of Lincoln. It is worth a re-read."
5,Team Of Rivals,Learned a lot of history from this book. Most of Lincolns history and the man that he was is never learned in school. Great read.
4,"Good, sometimes (understandably) slow","Excellent book, well written and researched. There are some sections of this book that will absolutely enthrall you and there are some sections that you will have to struggle through. The story is phenomenal and worth those few moments of struggle."
4,One of the Best,Thank you Amazon-- you are a wonderful company!! I was lucky to get this book and audio before the movie of Lincoln was released. I was amazed at the detail that Doris covered in this book. She does a wonderful job in giving the reader a picture of good leadership in the Oval office during some very difficult times.
5,The best history book ever!,"This book was so fascinating on many levels. First, the description of Lincoln himself. He can only be called a higher soul. The detailed inclusion of his cabinet, staff, & generals. Finally, the style of writing. I could not put it down a s it read like a novel for which I did not have a clue what was going to happen."
5,History at its best,"Kearns has undone herself. This brilliant historian gives us a thoughtful, insightful look into the complex relationships of extraordinary men like Seward and Chase. She adds another important layer to the loving, flawed humanity of Abraham Lincoln. This is the most interesting book of history I've read in five years."
4,Team of Rivals,"I found the first 100 pages or so very, very dry. But once, Lincoln wins the Rep. nomination it becomes a fascinating read. Especially if you enjoy history. Lincoln becomes REAL!"
5,Good read,Interesting portrayal of an interesting and volitale time in the history of the United States. I am intrigued to read more about Lincoln after reading this.
4,Team of Rivals,"This was a fascinating story. I knew Lincoln is considered a great man, but a genius? Now I know he was. He used those who would have defeated him in his bid for the White House to help him run this country at a critical time. Those who would have used him he deflected with grace and tact. He appointed men the army had no use for to run the army. Grant who had been forced to resign from the army. Sherman who the newspapers would accuse of being insane. But Lincoln saw in them the leaders they would become. Read this book or listen to the cds as I did and you will gain a greater understanding of the man, his time, and his legend."
3,Good quick read...,"Overall I enjoyed reading this book. Having read very little about Lincoln or the Civil War, I found this book informative and a rather quick read. I'm always surprised when reading history that we (humans) keep making the same mistakes over and over and over. There are many parallels between the challenges faced in this book and our modern times. It takes the passage of time to spot a Lincoln. I wonder if we have any around today?"
5,Amazing Book,Doris Kearns Goodwin weaves the biographies of 5 men with history to tell the story of Lincoln's political life. More than worth the time it takes to read.
5,Reads better than a novel,"I'm so glad I read this before the ""Lincoln"" movie comes out here in South Africa. I've recently been on a biography binge, first reading about Benjamin Franklin, then Thomas Jefferson before starting this book.This detailed multi-biography flows like an engrossing novel, including not only the life of Abraham Lincoln but also his main political rivals whom he included in his executive Cabinet. I will forever equate the word magnanimous with the name of Lincoln, that's how deeply the detailed narrative etched itself in my memory.After 4 days and some nights of reading, I was left with the feeling I had witnessed the sadly shortened career of a truly great man."
5,Outstanding.,"I'm almost through with reading the book and have found it very interesting how Lincoln became involved in politics, and then worked his way through the various challenges. The author did an amazing job of researching historical data and individual correspondence (150 pages of acknowledgements) to pull out a realistic story of our government at work. I am definitely looking forward to reading more of Ms. Goodwin's books. It would be good for our elected officials to read this book and learn how one keeps the focus on what is best long-term for the country!"
5,Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,"Ms. Goodwin has outdone herself this time. I have cradled this book gently, reading a few pages a night to make it last longer. I had always indulged a bit of curiousity about the characters in Lincoln's cabinet, and read a bit about different ones from time to time, but Goodwin has brought it all to one place and put each of them in perspective. Like most Lincoln authors, she ignores the Great Sioux uprising of 1862, and Lincoln's active engagement in it, but that is a minor quibble. This will become required reading for anyone interested in Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War."
4,Worthy of owning,"The best review I can give Goodwin's treatise on Lincoln and his cabinet is that I got the book from the library, and midway through I bought it. (Yes, from Amazon.) Goodwin's prose is not as captivating as Ron Powers' Mark Twain bio, but it's fluid and easy to read. There is no need to constantly re-read passages to obtain the point, a style I wish many academics would copy. Goodwin reveals Lincoln's relationships with his diverse cabinet and demonstrates the man's genius at getting the most out of subordinates while maintaining their respect. I gave her four rather than five stars because of her penchant for throwing in interesting facts that were not necessarily relevant. Still, these incidents are not plentiful enough to be obtrusive. Recommended for everyone."
5,Outstanding!,"I'm about half way through the book, and I can hardly put it down. We all know ""how the story ends,"" but the details the author has to get into the very lives of these people makes for great reading. Oh, how I wish we had such statesmen today!"
5,Team of rivals,Don't be put off by the large number of pages! Nearly half are notes at the end. This was a well-written true story of Lincoln's life and interactions with his cabinet and congress during his last 5 years. I found it fascinating/`
4,Good history and a good read,"Kearns Goodwin does a fine job giving us insight into the cabinet that Lincoln not only assembled but held together. For a reader who has consumed many good histories of the Civil War, much of ""action"" of the war seems to be left out, but in its place is an interesting and well told tale of big egos grinding away on each other, serving a cause that might well have foundered had this crew not produced for a leader they all initially undervalued."
5,Excellent historical novel!,"Ms Goodwin does a fantastic job of capturing the drive and mission of her characters. I've read several Lincoln biographies, but this is the first that really brings to life Lincoln's contemporaries."
4,Not As Good As I Thought,"Don't get me wrong. This is a good book, but it's not as good as I thought it would be or had heard it would be. I expected more from Doris Kearns Goodwin. It didn't go into the political genius as much as I wanted. It details the four men in Lincoln's cabinet that play a major role. It's more about them and their interactions than it is about Lincoln's political moves. There is a lot of interesting descriptions of the generals, but I got tired of the McClennan drama being detailed. I definitely didn't enjoy the pleasure that Ms. Goodwin got from detailing Kate Chase's every move. I just wish this book had been a little shorter and concise about events. It needed in my opinion to be more about Lincoln's political thoughts and why he did what he did. However, I did enjoy the background of Seward, Chase, Stanton and Cameron. I would only recommend this book to amateur historians and not the general public who are picking it up because President Obama mentioned it."
2,Christmas book,This book was purchased as a Christmas present for a family member. It is not something which I would read
2,hoping the book is better than the movie....,"THe Movie was Torture....too long... D.D. Lewis tried so hard it was painful to watch him do the basics...walk, talk etc. In spite of that I bet he wins an oscar for all that trying.... They could have knocked off 30 minutes and it would have been better...hoping this book is better."
5,Wonderful,"Saw the movie, Bought the book. Now I want to see the movie again. Love the book, I would recommend it."
3,it was pretty good.,the book was funny and it has a really good ending. lots of my friends read it. I really think that you should read it. Bye
3,Not great but OK,Fiskars makes a lot of good products so I decided to try their pruning saw. The first thing you notice is that it is not well balance. The handle feels like it is not aligned to the sawing action. When you saw it sort of floats on the wood. You have to apply pressure to get it to cut into the wood. I compared this saw to a Coronia razer cut professional saw. The Cononia is half the weigh. It is designed to cut on the pull stroke and has a replaceable blade like a Japanese pruning saw. It cuts into the wood with hardly any pressure and you are done in half the time. If you do a lot of pruning go with the Coronia.
5,Very Good Value,"It's not exactly a Japanese pruning saw but, at the price, one shouldn't expect it to be. It is, however, a high quality mass produced item that performs exceptionally well enabling the user to handle even large branches with consummate ease. And, as I have already suggested, the price is irresistible,"
5,The Series Continues...,"The ending to this one sure was a surprise! I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book, with football playing a large role in it. But the characters were as fun as always and the plot was more of a shock than usual. While I am looking forward to the next two books, the formula of the frame-up defense is wearing a little bit thin... I guess these books aren't really meant to be read back-to-back like this."
2,"This ""Carpenter"" entry needs fixing!","""Sudden Death"" is the second Andy Carpenter book that I've read(I was introduced to the series last year when I read 'Bury the Lead'). As with the previou book, the charaters are inteesting, well-developed and quirky without being too annoying.The plot is the biggest problem with 'Sudden Death'. There's a lot of build-up, but very little payoff. This won't stop me from reading other entries in this series, but Rosenfelt needs to tweak things a bit. Some of the similarities to Robert B. Parker and the 'Spenser' cast are rather obvious here. Maybe Rosenfelt needs to work on finding his own 'voice' and motivation for these characters, rather than simply emulating what others have done before."
4,Andy Carpenter is at it again.,I love this series. Rosenfelt makes all of the lead characters interesting and he manages to make the courtroom bearable.
3,Series slows down,"With the 4th book in the series Andy Carpenter's witty observations, love of his dog, relationship with Laurie, as well as his springing rabbits from hats to get his clients off all don't seem as fresh and compelling as they were in the firsr couple of books. The continuing cast of characters are comforting in their familiarity, but Andy and company seem to lack some kind of edge compared to other series. Maybe Laurie returning to her childhood home and Andy seeing other women will add some interesting aspects to the next few adventures. All in all, it is a series worth reading - the last two books just have not been as gripping as the first two novels."
4,entertaining,"murder in a robert B parker kind of vein -- andy carpenter himself is not a tough guy, but he has a tough guy to protect him, and like Spenser, Andy has a dog companion (although the author could use her more). I read this book in an afternoon and enjoyed it a lot; my one warning is that the plot has some holes in it that some may find irritating."
4,A must read,A must read for all Americans who should understand how our healthcare system really works.Extremely well documented. Mahar didn't shy away from any issue.
4,a great primer for better understanding the issues,"edited by author's son and it shows. but it is chock full of data, insights and anecdotes that i think help frame some of the issues we are facing as a nation. it does not offer solutions, just some background for more intelligent questions. i would highly recommend as a primer."
2,A Waste of Money!,"Of the nearly 100 books I have ever purchased from Amazon, this is the only one I returned. It does not even come close to living up to it's title ""... How to Light Your Fire and Keep it Burning..."". Instead, it's full of circular reasoning. If one is motivated to live a selfless life, in the balance suggested by Durand, then one can be motivated. It makes no sense. On top of that, the book is full of religious propaganda. This book should have been titled ""How to Live in Society's Box"". In short, the author confused Motivation with getting along in this society, as do so many authors on the subject of Motivation. The answer I was looking for was ""Why"", not ""How to"". Don't waste your money or time on this one. There are plenty or real motivational books on ...."
2,Keep searching for a better read!!,"I don't think there is a message in this book that cannot be gained from mere common sense. The writer touches on most subjects that are already in our thoughts, i.e. life balance, less ego, etc.Find a book that illustrates motivation more poignantly."
2,book review,Haven't really been able to go through this book. It doesn't hold my attention too well. Wouldn't really recommend it.
3,Honestly: I Was Bored,"I love wine, and I have a geeky love of science, so this book seemed perfect for me. When I found myself gritting my teeth at the thought of finishing it (about 3/4 through) - I just skipped to the last chapter to be done with it.This tale of vineyard woe follows the worldwide incursion of the maddeningly mysterious Phylloxera vavtatrix mite (try saying that five times fast). Campbell's blow-by-blow account of the ecological disaster is very well-written and is cleverly divided into sections named after the stages of death (On Death and Dying (Scribner Classics)). The different methods employed to banish the mites read like a dossier for Homer Simpson, however, it is about as interesting as a book about insects can be to a layperson (not very much).I think this subject matter is very interesting, but I would have been satisfied with aMental Floss (1-year)article."
2,Interesting story - poorly conveyed.,"This is an extremely interesting biological and viticultural story. Unfortunately the history is poorly and haphazardly organized. Although Campbell strives to make the characters (scientists, viticulturists, and bureaucrats)three dimensional - his insistence on chronologically following the activities of multiple individuals comes at a high cost of understanding. The story would have been better told - I feel - by focusing on fewer players or including a more organized interspersion of biological context."
2,Lamy needs to work on their nibs,"I went through two of these, both purchased on Amazon, and returned both. The pen has great ergonomics, a nice piston filler system, and an ink-view window that is (contrary to some people's opinions) functional and discreet. So why did I reject two of these? They both wrote very jagged horizontal lines - it looked like ink flow was very uneven on cross strokes. And yes, I did thoroughly flush each pen and tried several different inks - and the problem remained.I know Lamy USA has good customer service, but there is no way I was keeping a pen that needed service upon arrival."
3,Lucy Sullivan Wore Blinders,"I enjoyed the book in the beginning, but I honestly could not stand the way Lucy blamed her poor mother for everything! Nor did I like the way she talked to her mother, and seemed to think that was okay. Lucy seemed retarded to me, and I mean that in the true sense of the word. I read most of the other reviews, and I have to ask, why does everyone seem to feel its okay for Lucy to constantly denigrate her mother? Yes, I am a mother, and yes, I wanted to bash her (Lucy's) head in when I read about all her mom had to put up with from her father, and then from Lucy, too. Is anyone really that clueless? I suppose her boyfriend could have beaten her, and maybe that would have opened her eyes, since nothing else could."
2,"This is no Bridget Jones' Diary, no matter what the blurb says.","This book kind of reminded me of the HBO series Girls...a lot of young women with no self-esteem making fools of themselves over guys. The blurb compares it with Bridget Jones' Diary (""Fans of Bridget Jones will be delighted."") And I can see the comparison, but delighted? Um...no.The book spends a long time following the main character through her disfunctional relationships with her parents, her brothers, her room-mates, her boss, her co-workers and, of course, her boyfriends. It took a very, very long time for me to even care about the character; the author was lucky that I don't give up on books easily. Lucy does ultimately grow a spine, but it's a long slog to get there and there are few surprises except for how quickly everything gets resolved."
5,Not heavy - Just fun,"I really enjoyed this book. Yes, it's sort of corny, and boy-crazy, and predictable - but it was entertaining, funny, and just plain fun."
3,Not as good as Watermelon,"After reading Watermelon, also by Marian Keyes, I waited in great anticipation to read her next novel. Finally, having gotten it, sat down, and read it, I was not as fulfilled as I was reading Watermelon. It seemed to drag on, for too long, only picking up near the end. I have to admit, I did rather like the novel, upon finishing it, but it was probably not worth the time I put into reading it. If you are looking for humor and fun, try reading Watermelon. I think you'll like it much better."
3,The least enjoyable of the lot,"I just finished reading Lucy Sullivan and of all the books Keyes has written I think this one is the least enjoyable. The first book I read by Keyes was Watermelon and I loved it so much that I immediately arranged to get all her other books. (Since I live in Israel that requires more than just going to the local book store.) Although this book was at times very funny, and insightful, I have to agree with one of the previous reviewers and say that I just didn't care about these characters (namely Lucy Sullivan whose behaviour after awhile really got on my nerves) like I cared about the characters in Keyes other books, especially in Watermelon and Rachel's Holiday. But Keyes remains one of my current favorite authors and I look forward to anything she writes in the future."
3,"This is no ""Watermelon""","I recently made the joyous dicovery of Marian Keyes's ""Watermelon"". So, you can imagine how excited I was to receive her new novel ""Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married"". Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I didn't ""suffer-through"" this book, I did find parts of it enjoyable, I just didnt' have the connection with the characters that I did with ""Watermelon"". In all honesty, I didn't love these characters, I didn't even like them very much-namely Lucy. This alone makes it difficult to recomend this book. Read this book and be slightly entertained. Read ""Watermelon"" and laugh-out-loud from start to finish! I do look forward to Ms. Keyes next book!"
4,Slow in spots but worth sticking with,"I loved Marian Keyes' other books, and by the end, loved ""Lucy Sullivan"" too. Keyes does a great job of capturing the Bridget Jones-esque lifestyle and man-quest of 20something women. Her characters are believable. And the book is so darn funny! I laughed out loud a number of times, and kept reading passages to my husband, who found them as amusing as I did. This book does, however, have a tendency to ramble and could have used another edit or two to tighten it up. (In particular, conversations, especially nonsensical and ultimately annoying Gus-Lucy conversations, went on way too long.)"
2,i'm thinking....no.,"Everything was way too obvious and drawn out. I'm not sure I would recommend it unless you want to read about someone being depressed all the time...and ignoring the obvious fact that her father is an alcoholic...and that she only dates lazy bums...and that she is so blind that she can't see that her friend likes her throughout the entire 400+ pages!!!! Lucy Sullivan whines too much for me. And everything in the book is too obvious and her views are way too pessimistic for light, enjoyable reading. For light, funny, enjoyable reading...I would recommend the Shopaholic series by Sophie Kinsella."
2,"""Er...Lucy Sullivan is so tiresome.""","I enjoyed Watermelon, but ""Lucy"" left me wondering why anyone would consider this poor girl a laugh-out-loud entertainment. She was annoying in the extreme and, at one point, I was ready to shred the book because of the repetitious use of ""Er.."" to begin each character's statements. Was Marian Keyes being paid by the word; was the English version longer because there were more ""Ers""? Are promiscuity and alcohol dependence really so funny to so many of Lucy's fans?"
3,It's no Watermelon,"I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book after LOVING Watermelon so much! Unfortunately, it just wasn't as good. I, too, dated an immature, commitment phobic, alcoholic Irishman...and related well to the story, but this book just wasn't as funny or gratifying as the author's other works. I do still greatly enjoy Marian Keyes' style of writing and look forward to diving into her other efforts. However unlike Watermelon, I'm not passing this one along to all my friends!"
1,Boooring!!,"I love Marian Keyes; she's one of my favorite authors. However, this is her worst book by far. Lucy is so dumb and exasperating; it was hard to finish the book. The plot was ok, but the ending was so predictable and Lucy's personality so frustrating that I wouldn't recommend this book."
2,Did Not Like Lucy!!!,"This is not the most horrible book that I've ever read, but after about 150 pages of Lucy's whining, I skipped through to the very predictable end. What I hated most was Lucy's rampant self-denial regarding her relationship with her parents, her overbearing roommate, and finally the men in her life. It all seemed like a contrived plot point to give the story a purpose. Lucy was more like a 14 year old girl with no self-awareness. ... I would only recommend this for young women who are graduating from young adult romances ..."
3,Cute,"I thought the story was cute, but I found the authors writing style very frustrating. The endless paragraph-long sentences made it feel as if someone was telling a story without taking a breath. The way she would ramble about 2 or 3 different stories in the middle of a story seemed to draw out the book. It was pretty long for chick novel, and I think it was mainly because there was too much rambling.I found myself just wanting to finish the book already, and reading to find out what happened in the end. It's weird, because I enjoyed the story, but I just didn't enjoy her delivery. :("
2,Disappointed,"I really enjoyed Watermelon. Compared to Watermelon I found Lucy a difficult book to read. It was predictable, too long and was very slow in the middle. During all the early nonsense with/about Gus I wondered if I should even finish the book or move on to something else. I did finish reading the story. Read Watermelon instead."
2,Lucy Sullivan is Needing Therapy Not Marriage,"Lucy Sullivan is having troubles, the least of which include her marriage prospects! Expecting a light read, I instead found myself plunged mercilessly into Lucy Sullivan's world of depression, drink, and family discord. Attempts at humor were sometimes forced and rather ...trite? Example: the bit about the wining, dining, and six...you get the point. Instead of identifying with Lucy I found myself becoming disconcerted with her incredible lack of insight. Repeating the same blunders for 740 pages, it seems Lucy Sullivan will never sort it out. Her relationships with others are plagued by her lack of perception and intuition. The reader knows what Lucy Sullivan should ultimately do...740 pages (and as many social miscalculations on Lucy's part) later.. Lucy sullivan DOES seem to ""Get It"". But what a time getting there! Definately will not be recommending THIS one to my friends."
2,A poor copy of Bridget Jones,"This book is amusing enough, but I found it to be a poor copy of Bridget Jones's Diary. At times, the dialogue seemed to drag on as well."
2,Junk food for the brain,"I'm a full-time Mom who doesn't get much time to read these days, so I guess that makes me more critical of the books that I do pick up. But I didn't feel like this one was worth the effort. It wasn't that it was terrible - it's a quick read and amusing in parts - but it didn't stretch me in any way and I felt like it was too long and not amusing enough for the simplicity of the story. It started well but didn't keep the momentum up. I wouldn't recommend it. Life's short and there are too many better books out there."
2,Not her best work,"It was interesting to read that perhaps a European would identify more with the characters than a North American, but I thought it was awful and shocking how Keyes' characters were cruel and bullied the overweight character, Meredia. I thought that Keyes' addressing the reasons for Lucy's depression was an interesting approach for light reading though."
2,I could not finish it.,"I loved ""Watermelon"" so much that I read it twice. I really wanted to love ""Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married"" but it bored me to tears. It was pretty obvious, early on, who Lucy would end up with. I forced myself to read half of it and then I gave up. I skipped to the epilogue, confirmed the obvious, and called it a day. Oh well, hopefully ""Rachel's Holiday"" will be much better."
4,Great book,"I really like marian Keyes way of writing. She always manages to tell a story that somehow gets you thinking about your own inner self. Lucy was a realistic character. As the book progresses, you come to understand some of the things about her that didn't make sense at first. You really come to care about her too. There were parts that could have been edited a bit more, so the book was a bit longer than it had to be. But all in all, I truely enjoyed the book."
4,Happy Brain Holiday,"This was a nice Brain Holiday book. This is not a book I would normally read, but was told it was quite funny when a waitress told me my fiance reminded her of a Gus in this book. So I bought it. I camped on the couch, turn my brain off, and read all 600+ pages in a couple of days. Happily aside from being unique, he is nothing like Gus (the fiance). Point being, the book is fun. It is an easy read and a page turner. No, the characters are not deep bright people. They are sterotypes of people you know. This limited development is meant to be fun. Not much more. It will not change your life, but guys it IS fun!Next time you want to take a break from purpose, this will make a good read."
4,Such an easy read!,"I got this book on a Monday and finished on the following Thursday! All 440 pages are worth it! Lucy is such a realistic character. She is like alot of women I know. Hopelessly in denial and willing to help at any cost. I wanted her to find her love so badly that I struggled with putting the book down. At times I wanted to crawl into the book and shake some sense into her and other times I felt so sorry for her for the situations she was in.I truly wanted to be her friend. Marian Keyes writes a character that I grew to love. When I finally reached the end, I found myself wanting more!"
5,I LOVE MARIAN KEYES' BOOKS,"I am going to keep this short and simple as so many others have gone into great detail. ANYTHING written by Keyes is a guaranteed winner! This book is absolutely no exception. After reading it last year, I bought copies for all of my girlfriends. The way Keyes depicts the characters in all of her books just leaves me in stitches. I am dying to get my hands on anything new she has written. For those of you who are new to this author, you too will become an addict."
3,Good Within Its Genre,"Like many romantic comedies, you know in the first 50 pages who the Lucy of the title is supposed to falling love with and marry. True to the genre though, she doesn't, and it takes 400 pages for things to play out to the point where all is as it should be. The 400 pages in this book mostly work as 20-something Lucy searches London for Mr. Right, deals with her shrewish mother and alcoholic father, her girlfriend/ roommates (one domineering, one ditzy), and her co-workers--who are obsessed with not doing a lick of work. At times the book suffers due to Lucy's stubbornness and inability to see what's so apparent to the reader, but on the whole it's not without it's charm, albeit with few surprises."
3,Er...,"I bought this book because I read ""Rachel's Holiday"" and really liked it.I thought this book was O.K.What annoyed me about reading this was the way the author had the characters talking. On every page there is a ""Er...well..."" and that bothered me after awhile. It was distracting to me and about 100 less ""er""s would have been good.Er..well..I guess that's all I have to say about this book."
1,I don't care what Lucy Sulilvan does!,"The book begins with Lucy explaining that she dumped a man who loved and cared for her--becuase he was ""stiffling."" The author has created a character that doesn't love herself and is truly sabotaging her own life. She's a miserable person and I have no interest in reading about miserable people.When good things happen she can't be happy, when bad things happen she says ""of course!"" Why would I care one bit about this character??"
5,Great,"I get annoyed when all books end too perfectly! Other than that, Keyes really can touch your soul. Her characters are true to life. The depression she touches on in this book, all her characterers in all her books, are very realistic.Excellent story too!!"
4,"Fun, Cute and a Load of Laughs","I read ""Watermelon"" and it wasn't one of my favs. but so many of my friend had told me what a wonderful writer Marian Keyes is, so I decided to try again. So, I did, with ""Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married"". Boy, am I glad I did. This was such a fun book. I truly enjoyed it. It was light, humorus and a real treat to read. It's not deep and emotional, but then again it doesn't claim to be. It lives up to my friends high praise. Good Call!"
2,Not a favorite of mine,"I've read all of Marian Keyes books so far. In fact, I've picked up most of her books through the UK Amazon.com just to get a jump on the American publication date. So, I guess you could say I'm a fan of hers.However, I was disappointed with this book. You know how good directors tend to sell out a bit when they get popular? It kind of feels the same way with this book. It seems it's written for the masses and not from her heart.Oh well. It's certainly not a bad book, but when compared to her other works, i.e. ""Last Chance Saloon"" and ""Rachel's Holiday"", it just doesn't measure up in my opinion."
4,Very Insightful,"I found this book to be a very interesting look into the single woman's mind. Not only could I totally relate to Lucy and her character, but the way she kept getting in these self destructive relationships, even though she knew she was being a doormat, was very realistic. I dont know about you all, but I have been Lucy and done the things she has done from time and time. And God, help me, I can also agree with her logic. The ending was somewhat predictable, but pleasing nonetheless. I recommend this book."
1,"boring, repetitive, and NOT a romantic comedy","Okay, first of all, how can a book be called a romantic comedy when its not really that funny and there's DEFINITEY NO ROMANCE?? There was not a single romantic scene in the book. Also, the main character, Lucy, has no spine. She is rude and callous to the nice people in her life (her mother, Daniel) and is pathetically meek and mild and lets others walk all over her (Karen, Gus.) And how many times can one person's name be repeated over and over??? ""Hi, Lucy Sullivan. Let's go to dinner, Lucy Sullivan. Hey, Lucy Sullivan, how are you?"" If you think thats annoying, try reading the book, where every other line of dialogue is like this. REAL PEOPLE DO NOT SPEAK THIS WAY. I wish I spent my seven bucks on something else. NOw, if you're looking for a real romantic comedy, try out Come Together by Josie Lloyd and Emlyn Rees. That was romantic, funny, and touching. This book was pure drivel. Awful."
3,"Predictable, but I could not stop reading.",A cute tale about a sensible young woman in England that has a wonderful platonic relationship with a friend of her brothers. I raced through much of it just to get to the end.
2,So predictable... didn't even bother finishing it.,"I didn't even finish this book because it was so boring. It was very very obvious from the start who she would end up marrying (and I checked the last page to confirm my suspicions). Anyways, this isn't really such a great book. Lucy is attracted to a drunkard at a party and that's the end of that for me."
2,2 dimensional characters,This book was ok. An easy read which was what I was looking for. But what I found most disheartening was the characters. They all seemed shallow and I especially hated the way Marian Keyes portrays gay people. The gay men in her novels are so painfully stereotypical it makes me wonder if she's ever met a gay person. The characters were far too 2 dimensional for me and I couldn't care about them enough to really enjoy the book.
3,"Enjoyable, but a bit trivial","'Lucy Sullivan is getting married' is set in London and is of the city-girl genre: young scatterbrained twenty-somethings sharing a flat and looking for romance. It's amusing while it lasts, but a little forgettable; it would probably appeal to people who liked 'Bridget Jones' Diary.'I enjoyed it, but much preferred 'Watermelon' and 'Rachel's Holiday.'"
5,They finally made it available to the U.S readers,I found the Marian Keyes books about three years ago and I bought all three of them upon reading the cover description of the first. I loved them from the first page on. She writes so fresh and poignantly true that you expect your best friend to pop up any minute. What I really loved about the books is the typical English way which differs so greatly from the American books of this genre. I recommended the books to all my friends but then nobody in either the States nor the Australias had ever heard of her. I don't know how the American version reads itself but if you can get hold of the British one do so and do it in hardcover for you will read it many times!!!
4,"fun, fast read","I have been on a British chick book kick ever since I found Bridget Jones last summer. The teaser for this book really got me curious, so I just had to find out who Lucy Sullivan was, and who she was going to marry. I will say that at times the book was a bit tedious....but then again, isn't life at times? I found myself rooting for Lucy to get with ""the guy"". How I wish a psychic would tell me I was going to get married within a certain amount of time, and find myself hurled on a road of romantic adventure."
4,A joy and a surprise...,"Four friends seek out the most remote, and therefore the most reputable fortune teller in London. Although Lucy Sullivan does not believe her predicitions are at all believable, as her friends prophacies begin to ""come true"" she can't help but wonder.... The characters fleshed out wonderfully well, and I couldn't put it down. A wonderful summer read, rainy day read, any day read, with an ending that's not quite what you might have predicted."
4,Will she wise up or won't she?,"When Lucy Sullivan visits a psychic with a group of friends from work, the psychic predicts that Lucy will marry within the year. Will she or won't she? That's the fairly slender premise on which this longish (for a romantic comedy) book is based.Shortly thereafter, Lucy meets Gus, an unreliable, broke, but charming (to Lucy, less so to me as the reader) man who soon becomes a serious romantic interest.The scenes of Lucy's heartbreak are familiar but nevertheless charming, as she and her roommates (the sympathetic Charlotte and annoying social climber Karen) fall in love and out again. Due to a slow middle section in which Lucy pines for Gus, the book bogs down a bit but picks up near the end. To reveal more would spoil it for future readers (although you'll probably see the ending coming after the first 100 pages).Predictable, but charming. Probably much like Lucy herself. A good, light read."
5,Loved it!,I picked up this book while on a trip to England and was so very happy that I did. I absolutely LOVED this book and have read it several times since then.
4,Yeah for Lucy Sullivan,"I have read and enjoyed several of Marian Keyes novels. ""Lucy Sullivan is getting married"" is no exception. Any woman can relate to Lucy; a young, single girl trying to have fun while having the dreadful task of holding down a job-with the hopes of meeting Mr Wonderful. Add to this young, fun girl a few roomates, a dysfunctional family and a psychic and you are in for a great read."
3,"Ah, to be young and single in London","LUCY SULLIVAN IS GETTING MARRIED (at least according to the fortune teller Lucy is badgered into visiting by her co-workers)is a fun and easy story. WATERMELON, a later novel by the same author, seems funnier and quicker paced, but both books prove that Marian Keyes is a writer of genuine talent. After finishing LUCY, the reader will know what life is like for young, single women in contemporary London."
3,A bit of a let down but...,"Lucy Sullivan Is Getting Married was a bit of a let down for me. I read Watermelon and I loved it! I just thought Lucy was TOO vulnerable and TOO neurotic. I found it hard to like her.However, in spite of my differences with the main character (and the other characters), I do like Marian Keyes' writing style. Even though I found the book to be predictable, I still enjoyed how Marian Keyes told the story. It's worth a read but I can't list it as a favorite of mine."
5,SOOO good!,"I absolutely *loved* this book and could barely put it down. I laughed out loud and enjoyed all of the characters - especially Lucy. I also loved Watermelon, but this was my favorite so far by Marian Keyes. Can't wait for the next...."
4,Reads like a mental health textbook,"Why is romance and entertainment built on such a sad topic as alcoholism? LUCY IS GETTING MARRIED is the kind of book that begs for an answer to this quetion.It's no secret that a deep hopelessness and despair is what every alcoholic suffers. The drunk state gives some degree of relief from the pain of facing reality and other emotional conflicts. It's a kind of sedative. Lucy needs a sedative at times, thus gets drunk herself. Probably too often. Lucy at age 17 had clinical depression. Is this really the stuff that romantic comedy is made of?This book is interesting to read but not as comedy - it's too sad for that."
5,Fantastic,I was given this book by a friend and as soon as I started reading it I was hooked. Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married is the most fantastic book. Marian Keyes is a genius.
3,Predictable and long,"I thought this book was overall okay. I had read ""Watermelon"" and loved it, so I looked forward to reading more Marian Keyes. Unfortunately, ""Lucy"" did not live up to my expectations. From page one, you can tell what will happen - which is typical of most chick lit - but this went on for hundreds of pages of the same situations over and over. I think maybe this book is a fluke, and will try another Keyes book, but I would not recommend this one!"
2,ehhh,"the only reason that i finished this book is because it was the only book i had with me on the plane. usually i like these chick-romance novels, but lucy just lets every other character in this book walk all over her and i was left feeling no sympathy for her. it's just hard for me to read a book when i dont even care about the main character."
2,not the best Marian Keyes novel..,"I was first introduced to the world of Marian Keyes through reading ""Watermelon."" I loved this book so much, that I immediately wanted to read more so I chose to read ""Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married,"" thinking that it would be a fun read. After all, on the cover of the book implies that readers will 'Laugh till they cry.'But after reading it, the books actually wasn't as funny as people said it would be. The main character Lucy is quite nasty at times, especially to her friend Daniel who is so kind to her. The only reason why I finished this book was because I thought it might get better, but it didn't really improve much. I was a little dissapointed..but I will probably still read more books by Marian Keyes. But this one was definitely not her best."
3,Not the best Marian Keyes,"I have read Sushi for Beginners, and The Last Chance Saloon. Those are better, with more sympathetic characters. This book really dragged in the middle. It picked up for me after I visualized Lucy as a child of an alcoholic and understood the issues that causes. As others have reviewed, you can tell by the first 50 pages who she ends up with. It's too bad that the book drags out this conclusion for so long. Don't start with this as your first Marian Keyes, as it may then be your last."
3,Mixed feelings...,"The storyline was great and kept you on your toes throughout the book but the writing style left something to be desired. I felt that sometimes the descriptions were overly detailed and every single event that happens in the book goes into a flashback about the past. It made it sometimes torturous to try to get to the part you really want to read.Also, some of the characters were downright irritating. Although you are supposed to kind of love/hate them, you just end up hating some of them.. namely one of the boyfriends and roommates.Also, the author treats you like you are psychology idiot. The bouts with depression, alcoholism and picking bad men because of the example your father set are common themes that most people are familiar with. The main character treats them as though they had never heard of such phenomenon before. Not entirely believable.Therefore, I have mixed feelings. It kept me entertained but tortured me a little too."
1,Nothing to like . . .,"I enjoyed the first Marion Keyes book I read, ""Last Chance Saloon,"" so I was really looking forward to this book. I have struggled through half of the book, however, will have to quit. The characters are so unlikeable including the main character, Lucy, that I can't identify with any of them. The plot (what there is of it) is slow and predictable to the point of inducing sleep. I will try another of Keyes' books, but this one was, like its characters, a loser."
5,Great Love Story,"If you're in the mood for a happy-ending love story, this is it. I couldn't put the book down. Lucy is a naive, loveable woman, looking for love in all the wrong places, but ends up finding happiness and love somewhere she never even considered. I found myself rooting for her throughout the book, through every obstacle she encountered.Marian Keyes is wonderful at bringing her characters to life. They're believable, with real issues, and always seem to come out ahead in the end. This is chick-lit at the best!"
3,Lucy needs a good kick in the [rear]!,"I Love Keyes books and have read most of them and really enjoyed them. But Lucy got on my nerves so bad. Not only is she a whiny whimp who lets friedns and Gus walk right over here but she is also sooo ""respectfull"" towards her mother. I felt like slapping her so many times. I felt genuinly sorry for her mother. This was one of Keyes less good books, but still worth the read if you want to get annoyed at somebody. :)"
2,Marriage-in a year?,"That is the question for Lucy Sullivan, after a fortune teller reveals that she will meet and marry her dream-guy within a year. The fortune-telling opens the story, and then it continues telling Lucy's tale of ups and downs, her dreams, her search for Mr. Right. It has all been written before. The feisty room mate, the naive room mate, the gay-friend, the confused but cute heroine and the search for love. Not necessarily a bad thing to write a book about, but Lucy and the other characters never seem to come alive in a believable way. There are too many pages, and the story does not have enough 'meat' to be so long. It was, all in all, a disappointing read from an author I have enjoyed a lot before."
3,What a Whiny Character!,"I've never read a book before where I had to put it down because I was getting so annoyed with the character. Lucy Sullivan is weak. She lets her coworkers, her goldigging ""boyfriend"", her parents, and her roomates walk all over her. Then she whines about it the whole time. The only time in the whole book that I was happy with Lucy was when she walked out on her wretched pig of a blind date & left him with the restaurant's most expensive bottle of wine sent to him as she snuck out. Then just to annoy you, she calls the restaurant to try to pay for the bottle the next day because she felt bad for the man who insulted & belittled her. Give me a break! Lucy needs some balls."
1,They rarely work...,I have yet to enjoy these chimes in action. I am glad I got them as a gift otherwise I would be angry. Save your money!
1,Cheap Imitation,"I have bought dozens of replacement seats for my Breuer Chairs over the years and these were clearly an inferior product. They were much thinner than the normal ones and the workmanship was shoddy. I returned them for a refund and am still waiting. Don't be fooled. I recommend you purchase from Seats and Stools, who sold me a proper one."
4,Great for camping,We went on a group campout (12 parents & >30 kids) in November where the temperature got down to 32 deg F. We use the whole box that day/night. A little slow to heat up but it lasted a long time. Everyone loved them.
5,Lasts a long time,"These last for a long time and they reach a comfortable temperature instead of just a little warm. I have re-used these by placing the pad in a zip lock bag and squeezing out the air, if I did not need them to stay warm for the entire 18 hrs."
4,Good product for the price.,"Can't complain about these, have not had one yuet that didn't work. Best to let the ""warm-up"" for about 30 minutes to and hour. Trying to activate these once you get to the 15 degree cold duck blind, just takes hours for them to get started."
4,Not for Ski Boots,"I got these in time to go skiing in Vermont where the temps at the summit routinely fall below 0 degrees.The good: Stay warm as advertised. Even hot, actually. Definitely stay warm for the time advertised. Kept in pockets keep the core warm.The Bad: These are fairly bulky and there is no way to place them in the ski boots to keep the toesies nice and toasty, my original purpose for buying them in the first place.I will keep them, but definitely not use them as I had originally intended to."
2,Not for high altitude,I bought a box of 40. I tried one to see how well it works. It claims average temperature of 126 to 144 deg. F. I folded one of the activated product around an electronic cooking thermometer; it built up to a max. of 100 deg. F. while surrounding the thermometer. It's not warm enough to do much good. I live at an altitude of 6400 ft. The air may be too thin at this altitude to heat correctly. I'm not satisfied at all.
5,I am in the sticks,"I have made a temporary movie to SE KS. Electrical can be tricky in this extremely small town. When I purchased a below zero sleeping back I purchased these also. This is an item, that when you need it, there is no substitute."
4,Keeping the Kitty warm,A stray wondered onto the front porch in November and my wife and daughter started feeding it. We didn't want to take it to the shelter and we couldn't bring it in the house because we have other cats and dogs. So we got a box and put one of these in every day. Here we are nearly 4 months later and the cat is still sleeping in the warmed up box.
3,1/2 of them worked,"The 1/2 that did work were great! Must have been an old boxI will buy more of them cause they help my dad with his hands, he had Shingles and it leaves one of his hands cold. He just puts one of these in his pocket and he is good to go! He thinks they are the greatest things ever! He is 87 years old. If they make him happy... I am happy!"
5,Nice and warm,I use them in my shoes under my toes. They work great. Would recomend to anyone who spends time in the cold.
5,GREAT VALUE!!!,"This is the best value all around. take the time and read the descriptions of all around, this is it!I personally use these all over. I camp and hike year round and these are invaluable for both safety and comfort.As a skydiver, I also use these to warm my arms, legs, and neck after a jump (it gets a bit cold up there).p.s. you can also use these as a reverse cooler to keep food warm (think pizza delivery warm)."
3,These work OK,"I hate the fact that the contents shift so much that it all ends up as a large lump on one side so attempting to keep it pressed against the back or stomach is almost impossible. The heat is also very inconsistant, running very hot at first and then becoming too weak for most of the claimed time. They are still useful, but for my uses BodiHeat brand works far better and for longer."
1,Waste,"Please for the sake of your hard earned dollar, DO NOT BUY this product. This is a disaster. It's a total waste of money. It takes forever to heat up and how in the world is it supposed to stay on your body if it's non-sticky? This thing moves all over. Go for the Grabber. They are the best. Speaking of hot, yes, they are hot and they stay that way for hours. So please spend your money wisely. Buy the GRABBER."
2,Instructions on a box is a joke,"Well, tested 2 of them, waited about ten min, yes it warmed-up. Shaked it, beat it, not even close to promised temperatures :)"
5,Keeping toes and feet warm in the winter,I don't know how I could have worked outdoors with my feet comfortably warm this winter without this great product.
1,Worthless! Luke Warm at best!,"I am a professional gardener and need to use disposable hand warmers inside my gloves to keep my fingers from freezing in the winter. For the past two winters I used Heat Pax warmers and was extremely pleased. My normal day lasts about 5 hours and it was rare that I would have to change them out for a fresh set. But this year I couldn't find the Heat Pax, so I bought Hot Hands and I couldn't be more sorry. The Hot Hands by Heat Max are barely perceivably warm. I have to put 2 in each glove at one time, one on each side of my palm, to feel any measurable warmth at all from the ""Hot Hands"" and that's inside a gardening glove, covered by a latex glove! On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the hottest, these Hot Hands are a fraction of a one. Heat Pax are 10. Heat Pax sometimes got too warm. Hot Hands are just luke warm. Don't waste your money!"
2,A little heat for a long time.,"I wish I had not bought these HotHands2. They seem to be half the heat of others I have used. They last a long time, but I need a lot of heat for my fingers, not a little. I will have to use two for each hand."
5,Hand & Body Warmers,"The warmers have come in handy with the frigid temperatures we've been having, I would recommend this item. The only thing that I would like to see is a glove sized packet, something you could slip inside the glove. Otherwise, an excellent product!"
5,tested in Saskatchewan,These warmers lasted as long as advertised and made it possible for our hunting group to remain comfortable while staying in our blinds. We were on our stands for 11 hour days in sub-zero weather in Canada for a week and we had no complaints.
1,hot hands i think not,"they should be called luke warm hands...these were not very hot at all, a waste of money!"
1,very disappointed,"This is not the first time I have ordered this item. Previously, I have been satisfied with the product, however, these are definitely NOT WORTH ANOTHER ORDER!!!I can only assume this is an old box of hand warmers. More than half of them are already spent. Don't know how that can happen; they are not supposed to start the chemical reaction until you take them out of the plastic package. But these were already hard, the way they get after the chemicals are spent. There was no way to shake them to get them started, and even after breaking them into smaller pieces, they do not get warm. So that is half that don't work at all. The other half last for maybe 6 to 8 hours, not the 18 hours one is led to expect. A total rip-off, in my opinion."
1,WARNING!! VERY DANGEROUS!!,I fell asleep with one of these on my abdomen and woke at 3 in the morning with third degree burns that required a doctor's visit and lots of follow-up attention... and still not healed!WARNING!! TEMPERATURES ARE DANGEROUSLY HIGH FOR MANY HOURS!!!!
1,"wrong picture, wrong size","I ordered this product based on the picture advertized by amazon because I had an empty package of the product and matched it to the picture. The actual product that arrived said ""super"" and ""bigger and lasts longer"". I now have the wrong product which is twice the size."
3,was a gift,Don't know much about them. They were a gift and I know she likes them and have had no complaints.
5,18 Hour Super Handwarmers,"These 18 hour warmer are the best by far!!!! Awesome! These last all day, and beat all other handwarmers; bar none!! If you want the best, get the 18 hour Super Handwarmers!"
4,A good book to learn from,"I did some synthesis through my BS, MS, and even PhD career, and used a number of books in order to truly master the subject. Overall, I recommend Odian, Sperling's book, Allcock's, Rodriguez, and Craver & Provder. I used other editions of these books during my BS when I was doing synthesis."
3,Some good songs but buried in Too Much Horns!,"Kill City has some great songs on it and Iggy sounds great. James Williamson's guitars are killer too. The problem is there are saxophones and brass everywhere. It sounds dated and dilutes the guitars. My advise is to find the early recordings of stellar songs like Johanna on ORIGINAL PUNKS or other demo sets so you can hear the songs raw and heavy STOOGES Style! But this album isn't a total waste because songs like Beyond the Law, Sell Your Love, No Sense of Crime and I Got Nothing are stellar despite being over-saturated with brass."
3,weekend loony bin rock,"Everyone knows Iggy did this record while on leave from a mental institution. It's not a great record, but has some good songs (Kill City, Johanna, a few others). If you're on the fence about it, pick it up if you have all the Stooges stuff and good Iggy solo records (there aren't too many). If you're just starting out, you can live without this for awhile.It's a shame they never recorded all those great lost Stooges songs in a real studio (Head On, She Creatures, etc).Check out Mighty High...In Drug City."
5,Iggy's Exile on Main St.,"It really is. I guess the rock press ignored this album 'cause it was released on a small label ...or they were just being wankers. Or maybe this restored, remastered version is much better than prior versions. I don't know. I don't care. All I can tell you is this is pure, no compromise, heartfelt rock n' roll with a great signer and a top notch guitarist knocking out monster riff after monster riff. This is definitely the follow up to Raw Power. Sounds like the natural next step (and it foreshadows Lust For Life). This CD sounds great and again: It rocks.They were making the myths with this one.And only cool people know it."
4,Nicely Choosen Puzzles,"I am a firm believer that tactical work books, books on chess traps in the opening, and going over analysis of instructive games are the best type of books to improve your play.There are one thousand nicely choosen problmes containing some of the more important tactical patterns that will prove helpful in actual play. I don't like problems that are composed and have patterns that you would never come across in real play.A suggestion for improving most tactics work books. I would like to see a building of the same tactical pattern. Start of with a simple use of a knight fork, then make it so that the same type of knight fork must be found in two moves, then an even more complicated position that requires ideas to set up that knight fork in 3 or 4 moves!!! Are there any tactics work books that do that with at least 500+ problems? Yet to be seen."
5,Beads & Braids bt Jacqui Carey,This is an excellent knmihimo book for beginners and the experienced. It outlines everything in detail and steps you through the process. It is also filled with wonderful colorful pictures. There are many patterns provided for variety as well. Highly recommended.
4,Great Hose but not perfect.,"I got this hose was a little scared because of the negative reviews I was seeing. My experience is that the hose is MUCH better at not kinking compare to my Flexogen (expensive) hose. The Flexogen was almost unuseable in my backyard 3 to 4 kinks constantly and losing water pressure all the time. This Teknor has in 5 days of watering only mildly kinked once and when it did, a shake of the hose freed up the kink. The flexogen I would have to actually pickup the kink and straighten it; with the Teknor just a simple flick of the hose while still watering was enough to fix it. Huge Improvement! I give it 4 stars because it can still kink so Neverkink is a misleading name but works so much better its really more of a 5."
1,"Neverkink hose burst, basement flooded","Came home today to find my basement in over 6"" of water. My neverkink hose burst (granted, it did not kink) and filled my entire basement with water. Thanks a lot. It's not like it froze and split or anything. Today was 70 and sunny. Don't buy this."
1,This hose kinks all the time,"I have three Apex Neverkink hoses. Contrary to the company's claims, these hoses kink all the time. I don't think they are better at not kinking than much cheaper ones. I'm disappointed that I let myself get snookered by the claim on the packaging. If you are looking for a hose that doesn't kink during use, suggest you try a different brand."
1,Teknor Apex NeverKink Hose Kinks Badly and has No Stifness,"Bought the 100' length of 4000 series commercial duty hose because reviews were good. In warm weather this ""commercial duty ??"" hose becomes very soft and kinks badly. It has NO flexural rigidity in bending or squeezing. It is tangles easily when being dragged in sections across the yard. Product is NOT Recommended. Product returned to Amazon."
2,These hoses DO KINK,"If this were advertised and priced as a regular hose, it would be fine. It's a decent hose. But it absolutely does kink, and the false advertising is annoying."
3,I loved it while it worked,"I have loved this gadget; it is wonderful for a quick vinaigrette, mincing garlic and herbs (with the food processer attachment), and it works like a dream pureeing soups. When we used it to chop nuts (after a year or more of wonderful service) it died a sudden death.I have used the whisk to beat cream, but the consistency is uneven and you have to really concentrate to avoid spraying the world with cream."
1,Broke after a year of using,I was very disappointed to see that crucial inner parts were made of plastic. The lower hand blender part had a broken plastic part after a year of moderate using ( I mostly use it for blending soups). The mixer bowl is still working fine. I cannot ask for replacement because the warranty year is over... Research more before you buy this one.
4,Great Stick Blender!,"This is a powerful, versatile, and easy to clean piece of equipment. The cord is a good length and does not seem to get in my way. It has the power to crush ice, make good hummus, and blend just about anything. However, as I note below, it is NOT invulnerable, and that is to be expected.I purchased this to replace one that I had for a few years and burnt out (my fault, not Braun's). This one has a larger chopper than the old one, which is nice. It functions well as a small food processor.I do wish the smaller, higher button were the one that went to full speed, as that one is the more intuitive to press. If I want to use the variable speed feature, I have to make a mental effort to press the small button, and that is poor design. I also wish it still came with the more slender, stainless steel blending attachment. However, I still have the one from the one I burnt out, and it still fits."
4,Worth the money,"I love this gadget: I've been able to turn even frozen fruit into smooth shakes, and the chopper is great, though I've not used it as much as the blender.The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I found it kind of hard to control the whisk attachment even in most high necked bowls or beakers, and ended up with a couple of big messes in my kitchen."
4,versatile and practical gadget,"I find this product to be very useful in everyday food preparation, despite the fact that I had to re-order one of the blades as it broke one of the first times I used it (I learned that harder ingredients need to be chopped roughly before processing them).BRAUN customer service were very obliging, but it took 3 phone calls before obtaining the right type of blade (despite providing them with all the details available from the product's packaging and instructions).Nonetheless, I still gave this product 4 stars as it's really versatile, easy to assemble, clean and store and in general very good value for money."
5,The MR5550CA,I can't believe how fast I got my new MR5550CA hand blender! It took only 4 days! I am happy with it! It has a design to stop over the top splashes and it works great at 400 watts! I am going to like it as well or most likely better than the one I bought a year ago and I just love the first one that is 280 watts!! It is still like new and powerful for 280 watts! I have used it to make drinks with and grinding up ice in them! Both are Braun blenders!
5,a real time saver,"I recently purchased this product and am so pleased with it. I no longer have to take out my food processor and deal with blending several batches and cleaning the food processor. I now just plug in my Braun blender and place the blender into the same bowl/pot that is on the stove and chop, liquify or blend. I then simply rinse the blade or put it in the dishwasher. No extra bowls to clean and it does a fantastic job. Very powerful. My sister (who is the real chef) is going to get one as well since I can't stop talking about it. Excellent to make soups."
4,400 watts is good - but 600 watts is better,This is the second of these products that i bought. Loved my first one I bought in Europe but it didn't work in the States so I bought my second one. The one from Europe is 600 Watts which gets the job done. And I prefer the stainless steel piece on the immersion tool but overall I use this for more things that I ever could have imagined... and recommend it highly over the other products like this. You can't go wrong.
5,Most used item in the kitchen...,"...after our coffee pot.I'll just add my voice to the many here who proclaim this little baby's versatility and ease of cleaning. I received this as a Christmas present last year and was skeptical, but it has quickly become the most versatile and indispensable item in the kitchen. Fruit smoothies are so simple that in the summer we have them almost every day. I just used it last night to make butternut squash soup - scrumptious! and something I never would have attempted had I not had this stick blender. I purchased one of these for both my sister and mother-in-law this year.The complaints about having to hold down the button and the width of the blender head are legitimate, but very minor when compared to the overall value of this tool."
1,Confusion abounds,"Unlike the case of other products of its kind, this maker has valiantly tried to describe his product but with little success. For instace,""Weekly watering cycles may also be programmed with the exception of the days you wish to omit.

5,My search for Eddington's theory.,"Ever since I was an undergraduate in physics at MIT in 1974 and found an obscure reference to Eddington's theory in another book (Applied Group Theoretic and Matrix Methods by Brian Higman), I've been reading Eddington's books and papers dealing with his theory and trying to understand his ideas. Finally there is a book that was written by someone who has studied them extensively, published papers dealing with them and obviously has an excellent understanding of this subject.I have read this book several times and now have a good idea of where Eddington got his ideas and why he got them. The book has explained much of why it is so difficult to understand Eddington's writings. It has made me understand why he was convinced that his algebra was crucial to understanding physics. Also it points out some of the errors in his thinking.If you are familiar with Eddington's works and want to understand them better, this is the book for you."
2,"Not Really ""Roots"" of Power Pop - More Like the B-Sides","Not much of collection - essentially the scraps of the Power Pop Colection barrel. First, since these are all tracks from the 1980's - these are hardly from the ""root"" era of the power pop movement/sub-genre. But more importantly, while the Plimsouls and Romantics are featured and yes, we really don't need yet another collection with MILLION MILES AWAY or WHAT I LIKE ABOUT YOU - the fact that those two tracks are NOT on this CD is very telling - Very few people need some filler tracks from the Plimsouls or the Romamtics. There are no hidden gems or forgotten tracks, just a collection of passable power pop tracks from the 1980's - if you're a completist and you don't have the original LP's/CD's, you might want this ...If you want the real roots of power pop, check out - Friday at the Hideout: Boss Detroit Garage"
3,Informative book,"I bought this book only because I met the writer. He worked for me during a stint doing border security on the Arizona-Mexico border. The book was very informative and well written, it is a bit dry but not unreadeable. I would probably buy his other books l\once I find them because they are out of print."
4,"""I'ts about time somebody said it!""","Although I have not fully read the book, I already feel as if I can understand what is happening around me much clearer. Mr.Willer often makes remarks about the ""Cell Phone People..."" I just thought, ""THANK YOU!"" I now see I am not the only one that realized what all of this advanced techno hubub is doing to us! The author has many stories to tell, and I truly respect what he is doing now. There is so much to see in this world...so why not see it and beome closer to it also? Thanks James"
4,"I wanted to like this book more, but...","The first page or so was brilliant. Funny funny stuff. However the other two-hundred odd pages were lacking the wit and story I expected. I felt like I'd heard every story in this book before. It got old fast, and the characters were all grating cliches. I had to stop reading before I got to the end, and I never do that. Look at the cover in the store, flip it from side to side and say ""ooh"" and ""ah"" and put it back down, because that's as good as it gets. However, my sister read this book and totally loved it, so to each her own, I guess."
1,Too much cheese.,Just because this is one of the few fiction books set in the realm of graphic design doesn't mean it automagically gets a recommendation. I was very disappointed in the story and characters - straight out of clicheville 101. It seems Chip Kidd is better seen than read.
4,Huh?,"I love cheese, and own several capuchin monkeys, and neither cheese nor monkeys are featured to any real extent. A real letdown. I suppose, however, that if you're into sadistic teachers and package design this'd be right up your alley. Worth buying just for the Chris Ware cover design, though."
1,"Little Revealed, Wretched Plotting","I bought this book hoping to get a view of how people in design look at their craft and was disappointed. There isn't much I didn't already know or intuit. The sparse insights were not worth going through the absolutely preposterous plot machinations and the tiresome banter of the characters. Besides the numerous anachronisms, I knew tons of pretentious, edgy undergrads and these characters don't ring true. Forget it. I can't believe people are crowing about this book."
3,Manipulated.,"Four stars for cleverness and fun. Two stars for not being able to close a story. Notice I'm not saying,""Resolve."" Kidd is clever, entertaining, and offers wonderful--often hilarious, justifiable insights in to the demimonde of Art and the creatures to be found therein. Yet with the closing chapter, possibly two, Kidd becomes facile and employs a preposterous ""deus ex machina"" which more than anything suggests weariness with the story and/or an inability to end a thing which has moved beyond his ability to control/complete. I was entranced right up to the last two chapters and then felt Kidd reneged on all those high sounding principles he earlier expounded."
3,Funny and interesting. Should have quit while he was ahead.,"Amazing the things you learn by reading Amazon customer reviews. I didn't know Chip Kidd was a book jacket designer.Well, the beginning was very funny. The story was interesting, especially from the perspective of someone who is not an artist and only took one art (photography) class in college. The creative process was fascinating.But then what happens toward the end? The tone of the whole thing changes, and the book until that point doesn't really prepare you for how dark and disjointed it gets. The last chapter just seems very rushed."
2,Not terrible,"There's nothing really terrible about this book, but the writing feels immature, the ending slapdash. I enjoyed reading it, however, I will likely forget I ever read it, come summer. A good book for a long flight. I didn't hate it."
2,"Kidd tries too hard, or perhaps, not hard enough.","Like most other readers of this novel, I was immediately drawn in by Kidd's skillful metaphor, colorful wit, and quirky character development. The first 200 pages or so are absolute *gold*, but thereafter it seems almost as if the became bored with what he was writing and took it in a completely different direction (a transition much akin to switching from drive to reverse in a car while it's still in forward motion.)Toward the end of the novel, Kidd cops out with a lack-luster, anti-climatic ending, and leaves the reader feeling confused (what exactly happened to the oh-so-promising beginning?) and rather disgusted.Chip, I'll read another one of your novels when you have the patience to *apply* your skill (and you do have immense skill), rather than trying to make a statement by squandering it in flashy unconventionalism and cheap thrills."
2,Not bad for a first novel,"But Kidd needs to work on character development. Cheese Monkeys has the standard key players in this kind of scenario - Naive Young Narrator, Shocking Misfit Who Dresses Oddly, Southern Transplant, Egotistical Professor Who Teaches Through Fear, etc. No idea who these people really are or how they became the sketches of personality we are presented. Kidd also needs to work on better endings. Read Donna Tartt's Secret History instead."
4,Hilarious yet completely twisted,"I picked this up in search of a book for a presentation...I'm the person who looks at the book jacket and says 'oh this is interesting'... so as a coincidence I ended up reading this delightfully funny book. I found myself laughing out loud numerous times throughout the novel. Although sometimes a bit confusing, the characters have a nice mix and compatibility to one another. I could ""see"" and picture the characters just from the personality details.Toward the end of the novel, the plot took a mysterious twist and the mood (of the book AND of me i found) changed. All in all, this novel was definetely worth my time and reminded me how much I loved reading. Highly recommended..."
4,Teacher Insane...Book Awesome!!,"As an aspiring Graphic Design student, I found the book to be very insightful. The critiques made me laugh out loud, and Kidd shows that not only is he an excellent graphic designer, but he can capture the reader and put them in the classroom with his outstanding writing abilities. It was the eclectic cast of characters who made this book was a great read. I certainly recommend it to those who are interested in Graphic Design (or Commercial Design...whatever your preference), or for those who just want a good laugh."
2,clever moments,"The dialogue can be witty, and some of the writing wonderful, but it's too self-consciously ""clever"" and the smugness of the characters can be grating. When you go through college, you discover that the ""rebellious"" artistic types, the ""noncomformists"" that make up this book, are just as conformist as the sorority and fraternity crowds...it's just that they drop different references in conversation and are conformist to a different set of mores....but that nonetheless are a standard set of mores. ""Mies van der Roh, dahling."" So I didn't buy the whole ""free spirit"" aspect of Dodd, nor the others. I found her smug and grating and little else. But this is better written than a lot of other ""hip"" books I've had recommended to me, so can't dismiss it altogether."
3,Worth it?,"If you pick up The Cheese Monkeys, and expect a literary masterpiece with an engrossing story and convincing, fully formed characters, you'll probably be disappointed. Don't get me wrong; the story isn't horrible. It's just not going to blow your socks off. If, however, you pick it up expecting an interesting look into the world of Graphic Design, by virtue of form and content, you're in business. The strangest thing about this book, in my mind, is that I was never overwhelmingly impressed by it, but I don't regret buying and reading it. I say give it a spin...."
3,"Funny and impressive, ultimately dissappointing","While this book was funny, interesting, and at times eye-opening, it was dissapointing. I found it very easy to get through, and laughed out loud quite a lot (causing many curious stares in the coffee shop), but I couldn't help but be upset by the way Chip chose to end the book."
4,Good is Dead,"I dove into this book and devoured it with ravenous pleasure. I loved it all the way up to the last chapter ""The Final Exam,"" when the whimsical insanity and humour which had defined the book thus far deflated and was replaced with an ending which left me scratching my head and muttering ""what the hell?"" Perhaps this was Kidd's purpose. I know one thing is for certain, this book presented me with images that I had ""never before seen, and will never be able to forget."""
1,"...a poor, very best album!!!","Unbelievable, the poorest release so far from Sinner. This should be The Best Sinner but we get The Poorest Sinner. What's idea?? Who did make this?? This cannot be called the Sinner.Being around more than 20 years they deserve way better status in HM scene but with this CD their picture hit hard bottom.Hey, this CD should be avoided by any means.I assure you all just pick any of his album CD and you gonna feel and say everything The Best about SINNER."
3,"Nice, but limited storage","I got this product in hopes of storing several chair cushions; however, i can only fit two full-sized ones due to the seating space that is taken up. I still like the product so far, but should have done better measuring on my end. I may just move it to the garage for storing outdoor shoes and such instead of on the patio."
1,Of limited use...,"The marketing for this states: ""Can be used with patio cushions.""This is true only if it doesn't rain (or you like wet cushions).Also, there are no instructions enclosed, but it's easy...once you know the order of assembly by trial and error."
3,The tent doesn't match the picture,"Ok, I'll admit it. I read the other review on here, and I thought the lady had just ordered the wrong thing or hit the wrong button on her computer. So I ordered the tent anyway. And guess what? She was right! This is the wrong picture. The description is accurate, and it's a cute tent, but it is NOT WHAT IS PICTURED."
4,good,"I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level of fitness.Seems to be an earlier workout from this instructor, not as polished as later ones but still cuing is decent and encouragement is given without being overly peppy. Music has a beat, camera work is fine, her usual backup crew are non-annoying, as always.Kickbox sections flowed well and kept me on the low end of my target heart rate zone. Legs and glutes section was challenging but on the short side.Overall, one of the ""easier"" workouts but still a keeper."
5,Great backpack!,"This is a great pack! I used it for weekend travel while studying abroad in Europe for three months as well as traveling through Asia for one a half months. It has plenty of space to hold all of my items, and the build quality is top notch. Everything about this bag screams quality. Even the plastic buckles are built like a tank. No worries about accidentally stepping on them and having them snap like with cheaper packs.I really love the ability to tuck the straps in so that they don't hang loose and get ripped off if you want to check the bag at airport. This pack fits perfectly on trains and in the carry-on compartment of aircraft (even with Ryanair's strict rules!). Honestly, I can't say much about any gripes with the pack aside from maybe wanting some extra shoulder padding at times, but that's usually because sometimes I'm packing it with a ton of heavy items.Overall, a great back with great workmanship that I can't even foresee breaking anytime soon."
3,On the go!,I used this bag for a 2 week city roam-urban trek in Europe (Spain).All-in-one hand-carry bag. Good for an on-the-go people. Very versatile. Light. Neat design. Can use in business or off-road travel.
5,Excellent,"Family of five all just used Osprey Porter Packs for trip road through Patagonia - durable, fits a lot, like the backpack straps you can tuck away, and the cinch straps that tighten your bundle down to smaller size. Good colors too."
4,Solid Product,Used the backpack on a 2-week trip through Peru. Good capacity and comfortable on the back. Wife wants one for herself.
3,"Good concept, but some problems.","I phurchased this toy for my 3 years and 7 months old son. Shipping was fast and good. My son just started to play construction toys. This toy seems very educational and fun for him. But after we tried it, we were very diappointed with its quality and the instruction book. First, the color of the pieces don't match with what are in the instruction book, so it became very difficult to find the right pieces. Second, many of the screws can't be screwed onto the nails by hand. Some of them don't fit onto the nails, even with the tools that came with the package. All the pieces are made by plastic and very thin. But with this price, we don't really have compliant on this point. But if you prefer wooden toy or more elegant looking toy, this toy is not for you."
4,Pretty good,"What was one of several compilations released by TH Rodven, this album includes several of D'Leon's more memorable tracks like ""Se Necesita Un Rumbero"" and ""Hechicera."" A great thing about this artist is his wide range of themes as exemplified here with ""Mis Hijos"" (My Children) and ""Mira Pa' Ahi"" a song about prejudice and undeserved criticism in general, by people. Overall, the album is a bit short although these CD's went for $10 when originally released, so you can't ask for a lot more than that. I still would rather recommend Exitos Vols. 1 & 2, which are much more complete than this one. 4 stars in my book.For the benefit of all since Amazon has not yet provided track listing:1. Para Chango2. Hechicera3. Zapato Viejo4. Mis Hijos5. Se Necesita Rumbero6. Mira Pa Ahi7. Se Solicita un Novio8. Un Beso Tuyo"
4,sturdy bags,bags hold up well and are are priced well. No longer use since I now live in an Independent living facility where housework is done weekly.
5,Eureka Vacuum Bags,Have a cleaning company and am always looking for a good price on vacuum bags. Good value. Good bags. Will definitely order again!!!
5,Great Buy,These bags are great for the environment and the purchase price is great. I will definitely purchase this item again when needed.
2,SECOND THOUGHTS,"My original review was too harsh. The vac is good enough for picking up cat litter off white tile, when you don't care whether the job is well done or not."
2,"Misleading part for Eureka ReadyForce Bagged Canister Vacuum, 900A","It appears on Amazon as though these are the correct bags for the Eureka ReadyForce Bagged Canister Vacuum, 900A. They are not! Keep this in mind if you purchase the ReadyForce. Unfortunately over 30 days went by before I realized this so I'm stuck with 9 bags that don't fit my vacuum. The bags you will need are Eureka CN-4 Style Bag."
3,Its a bag man,"Well lets see, it's a bag, it fits and it holds dust without leaking. So if the price is competitive buy it."
3,Vacumn Bags,I'm sure trhe product is ok - its just that there was not enough information and the productwas wrong and no way to return it - couldn't tell it was wrong until package opened. Not happy.
3,Good Bags but Won't Fit Older Model Mighty Mite,"If the bags in your older Mighty Mite are marked ""Style C"" then these bags won't fit. Rather, the cardboard base won't fit. You can cut it to fit and use in the vacuum but look elsewhere for a true fit."
3,not bad,good bad just only one thing didn't like when its full its starts leaking dust every where make sure when its half full throw it away only thing wrong other then that not bad
2,Wrong Bag,"Style MM is the wrong style for my Eureka Mighty Mite vacuum, but there was no way to predetermine this. However with a little surgery with a knife, I was able to use them"
4,Wrong size,Kept them anyway. Cost too much to send back. I found the correct bags that work on the vacuum cleaner.
1,wrong one,I would review these vacuum bags except I had to send them back since the wrong ones were sent and they cannot be replaced for some reason.
5,Seem to work great.,"Bought them for my Eureka SC3683A. They seem to work great. Suction is super strong and I don't get any allergy issues from dust (along with attached HEPA filter) Probably not authentic OEM product, but I don't care. It works fine."
5,Good deal,"I purchased the Eureka 3670G Mighty Mite at the same time I purchased this 9 pk. of generic Eureka style ""MM"" vacuum bags. I wasn't sure if the vacuum came with a bag so I wanted to make sure I had bags so I could use the vacuum as soon as it came in. The vacuum did indeed come with a bag so now I have 9 bags waiting to be used. Getting the 9 bags was a really good price compared to buying it locally at our so called ""Discount Vacuum store"". I haven't had a chance to use one yet but I know I will be very happy knowing I don't have to go to the store an buy any bags for a long while."
1,WRONG BAG FOR EUREKA 900A MIGHTY MITE,"I received the MM vacuum bags and found they were the wrong ones. I got online, and found that I could talk to a Amazon rep in person. Put in my phone number, waited 5 minutes (my choice) and got a very nice rep named David. Now David researched my problem, and lo and behold found the correct bags for my 900A Eureka that I had just received (compared bags with one that came with vacuum-that's how I was certain the MM 9 pack bags were wrong), and gave me this number-B003L20FT0. He also gave me a credit for the wrong bags. I promptly went in and ordered the above replacement bags. They were only $4.99 for a 5 pack. Hope this helps everyone out that bought the Eureka 900A Mighty Mite vacuum.."
4,vacuum bag,i havent used it yet but it looks like the right one... looking forward to using it in the future!
1,Sound nice but flimsy,I bought these chimes as a fathers day gift. They sound nice but are cheaply made. The string/cord used is not run through the wooden blocks in anyway but is rather just stapled to the top and bottom and as a result of this just 33 days after hanging them the string that they hang from has torn. I will be contacting the manufacturer about replacement and we will see how things proceed from there.
2,NOT what I thought,"I am very disappointed with the chimes. The reason I ordered them was because of reviews that said they sounded like church bells...well they do if it hits once, but if you have a breeze and they move around alot, they don't."
4,Not as advertised,"I recieved this item a few days ago. Not that it matters but came in a box large enough to ship a fridge and the actual box inside was about 36""x1""x 6"" and weighed about a pound. I thought they shipped the wrong item. Anyway, I opened it up and the sound was great even though the chime was so light. My wife and I worked in the yard all day today while listening to the beautiful sound it made. The only thing that really irritated me was that it is advertised as US made and the box says made in China. It seems to me that this company should have to state the truth or not be an amazon vendor."
5,WOW,If your trying to decide if you want to purchase these do especially for the price the sound is amazing
5,Beautiful,"This is very beautiful, but much longer than I expected. Deep rich sound, like church bells. Excellent feng shui/vastu piece. Also, the price was so reasonable! I so the much smaller version for double the price. Shipped in perfect condition. Woodstock is a manufacturer with integrity."
1,Not thrilled,"The vacuum bags came extremely quick but when I put them in the vacuum, the bag ripped and became useless."
5,Great!,"I purchased the perfume as a gift! I knew it is one of my mom's favorites, she is using it for years...Even i sneak sometimes in her room to use it :0)It's for everyday or going out at night... Definitly worth to try!!!"
5,Much better than the Stones!,Anyone who listens to this magnificent cd and gives it less than 5 stars is a real goofball!!
1,A Pathetic Stab at Mediocrity,"Instead of buying the whole album, do yourself and your wallet a favor by only downloading only one song considering they all sound exactly the same. On the other hand, if you like talentless droning, lack of depth and variety which can only be compared to watching the landscapes change while driving through Nebraska, then feel free to waste your money on this mockery of an album."
4,Mocking the Music Business,"I think that this album rocks and not only because of the music, but the attitude as well. The Jonesers hit the nail on the head with the title of the album. It seems like this is the album the record producers want to see, but they do it in such a way that they are really mocking the system and its evil forces. Long live the free!"
5,poetry in motion,"Anton is a true genius of the Syd Barret/Rocky ericsson styleee! refreshingly beautiful rock from the 90s that sounds so familiar and cuts through one like a knife and leaves you wanting more, everyone should own a little bit of the BJTM. nothing has sounded better while high 4 a long time. play it over and over again, never tire of Antons beautiful lyrical madness and buy more..its all good man."
3,A truly underrated Merengue group.,"This budget-priced collection is really a compilation of their 1989-1992 recordings for the TH-Rodven label. This was a Merengue group that definitely deserved far greater acclaim and recognition than it got. While this compilation is far from definitive, it does offer eight of the group's hits at a very reasonable price. The remastering could have been better, however."
4,"Omar from Los Hijos, one of the best merengue vocalists","I met the group back in Puerto Rico and saw several shows I personally believe Omar Demorizi is one of the greatest merengue vocalists of all times. Great vocals, great group.Mirthy"
4,Nice variety,"Truly Nitty and Gritty... I was after old bluegrass, guess I found it. Seemed some of it was in need of a little lawn maintenance, but overall, an enjoyable CD, and nice set."
4,Still worth it!,"This is not the landmark CD of vol. I. It lacks the generational impact of that landmark event and seems to lack the good feelings of vol. II. These ""short comings"" mean that the third CD is the weakest of the family NOT that is a bad one. Coming in third, in a race with the first two CDs is not the same as being a poor CD. I like this one the least but listen to it often and always enjoy it. It shows me how bluegrass has grown and changed but still manages to keep the circle unbroken and remain true. This is the third generation working with the second generation and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. You can hear the changes in presentation and how the third generation differs from the first generation. Some of the songs do not work well and this detracts from the overall value. However, my clinkers differ from people I have talked to about this. This completes the series and you will want it."
5,very nice,Good quality product. It doesn't take a hurricane to hear the bells like some wind chimes. Definitely recommend.
1,This band is horrible.,Being the fan of the Rolling Stones I picked up this CD thinking it was something similar. Well they do try to emulate the stones sound but fail miserably. They have no originality or heart in their music who ever lets them make CDs should be forced to listen to it. If you buy this you are either a masochist or an idiot.
5,"Took a bit, but I love it","It took me a few weeks of listening to it to really get into this album, but I now love it. It really puts together alot of the elements of their past albums perfectly. My favorite song off of it at the time is ""The Devil May Care (Mom & Dad Don't)"". Every other song is good too, besides the last track which i rarely listen to. Great Cd by one of the best groups out there."
4,very helpful once you have a base COM & Ole db understanding,"this is the only book I could find on OLE DB besides SDK docs, so for that alone I am happy to have it. I did find his step by step approach to developing an oledb app was very helpful, once I had gathered enough knowledge from other sources about COM & some basic Ole db knowledge. this is a good book if you are an intermediate at com and have a basic familiarity with oledb and of course have a good grasp of c++; it was at that point that I found the book very helpful. But plan on reading other materials first to get your base understanding of com & ole db before benefitting from this book (and it was annoying to see comments stating that memset was allocating memory). This book does fill a good niche though to help you get from a base understanding of ole db to a very strong intermediate level (helped me do that anyway) and it saved me a lot of time making that leap that I couldn't have done without reading this book."
1,Waste of time/money,"This book seems to be mostly a printout of the help documentation with a few frills. It is downright insulting that books like this can actually reach the market :( It is riddled with statements such as 'Using storage interfaces to access BLOBs is covered in Chapter (Day) 5, but there's nothing remotely like that in Chapter 5. You're better off just using the SDK documentation."
2,No Visual Basic Examples,"This book contains a number of examples, but unfortunately a lot of them are for C++ followed by J++ and finally VBScript. No Visual Basic examples at all. If you principally code in Visual Basic, expect to do a lot of reserve coding from VBScript to Visual Basic.On the plus side, if you principally code in C++, the examples are fairly usefull and applicable. Also, the examples do not try to write an entire application in one snippet of code and I liked that.If you need information about ADO with Visual Basic, I would stick to the Microsoft Web Site and their ADO documentation in HTML form (also available in the Ole DB 1.5 SDK)."
3,"This is my experience with the Woodstock Garden Bell, Large","These bells are beautiful & definitely add to the front yard. They need either a strong breeze or a brush with your hand to make them chime. I would not return them as I'm pleased with my purchase & in the future would like to buy a second one. I can say from looking around this is a very good price. They do not chime alot but they are ""bells""(I wonder if they would chime more if the bells & their stems were hung upside down?? *grin* just kidding). I put them next to the path to my door so I can ring them when I walk by. I was disappointed one windy day when they fell over & some of the bells came off the stems although all I had to do is put them back in place. I think before winter comes I'll sink the base a little into the ground & add rocks on top of the base stone to keep them from falling over again. I hope sharing my experience with them has been helpful in your decision about this product."
5,A Delight in my Garden,I LOVE my garden bells! They make my garden sound as pretty as it looks. I enjoy hearing the gentle notes as I work in my garden. I followed the directions to adjust the bells for the wind in my area. The bells have done well in light summer breezes and survived well our nasty winter weather. One of my friends lined his entire garden path with a dozen garden bells. It is awesome - both in sight and sound. Gardens bells are a great and different gift for gardeners.
1,So where is the Garden Stone?,"I ordered two sets of Garden Bells as Christmas gifts weeks ago and one of them finally arrived today. But no ""garden stone"", as advertised, was included! I received the ""Stake model"" instead and it is now to late to send them back for replacement! The item number on the box is totally different from the item number on my invoice and there is no explanation. They are going back for a refund, this is no way to do business and I am very disappointed."
2,chime?? not these,"These are visually pleasing and made in the fine manner that all woodstock chimes products are.However, they are supposed to chime. These don't. I've adjusted them and moved them around my property. While all the other chimes are chiming, these are silent. Perhaps they are snow chimes- we'll see/hear next winter."
5,Woodstock Percussion Large,"Hallo,I want to order one the WGBLG2 big garden bell. How much did the shipping cost to Germany, 45721 Haltern, Talstr. 72.How long did it last.If shipping by an order of 90 dollar is free, I order the small one too. I pay by visa.Thank you and best wisches Karin Haberer-Unger"
3,"Neat idea, doesn't quite work","Some friends gave us a set of these as a house-warming gift about 10 years ago. We've had them at houses in both Washington (lots of rain) and California (lots of wind). Honestly I've never heard them chime except when I or the dog bump into them. Natural forces just don't push them around enough to make any noise. They do make a pleasant noise when bumped. It's a neat idea, and they don't look too bad sitting around, but you'd be much better off with a conventional wind chime if you want to hear anything."
2,not very well made,"They don't really make any sound. Wasn't that the point? I'd only buy them if you like the look, and want them for an interesting piece in your garden. They won't chime except in the highest winds (which, by the way, will bend the bells over, forcing you to constantly bend them back)Definitely not rain bells (to be fair, they're not advertised as rain bells, but I was hoping). The cups do not tend to fill with water, and do not chime in rain whatsoever."
2,the bells don't chime they clang,"I was really looking forward to receiving this. The shipping was exceptionally fast.The chime bells really don't make a nice chime, they sort of clang, so needless to say, I was quite disappointed.I thought they were way over priced considering the poor chime."
4,"Deck the Halls with a Good, clean vocal rendering.","Mr. Nabors early Christmas album is pleasant to listen to and when put on shuffle, with ten other CDs, he melts right into the fabric of Christmas with the likes of Der Bingo, Dean Martin, and Nat King Cole. The CD contains an excellent diversified listing of Old Reliables, and standards...I particularly like The Little Drummer Boy. You can't go wrong with Jim Nabors, Christmas standards, and his singing ability. Merry Christmas everyone!"
2,mario,"I ended up sending this back. Very cheap looking, and the stick on eyes and features were cracking , so they would not have lasted well. Fabric is very thin, you can see the stitching on the inside of the doll on the outside. There are more durable , cuter Marios out there."
4,Bought for collection,"I bought this Mario plush for my collection of Nintendo things. And from what I can tell, I think it will suit that purpose just fine. The face looks a little different than I thought it would, but that's really no big deal.I didn't buy this toy to actually be played with, however from the looks of I wouldn't think it could stand much abuse. Especially if it was for a young child. However, as far a collectible goes, I pretty much got what I wanted.So if you want something for a collection, then look no further. If you something for a child, you may want to get something else."
5,Mario and Luigi make Christmas!!,The Luigi and Mario toys were the only things my son asked from Santa. This was the only place I could find the plush toys. They arrived promplty and totally made his day.
5,Great meditation music,I have owned this in the past but someone decided they needed it more than me so I ordered another one to replace the one they took. It is an awesome CD.
4,Soul Retriever,I first encountered Marcey's music on a Hypnotherapy/Shamanic course called Soul Retrieval Therapy. The intensity of this music enhances the deep trance experience. A must have CD for therapists.
4,Inner Calmness,I can tell that I'm a lot more calmer energetically. Listened to it practically 24/7 the first two weeks I had it. Sometimes would feel the vibrations traveling.
2,"I love this cd, but.....","When Ms. Myss refers to this chakra and that chakra and says see this, what?, see what? Its a cd? I have no idea what she is refering to because it is a cd! It would really help if it was adapted to people who aren't there at the lecture looking at what Ms. Myss is pointing to at her lecture. However, I did feel as though there were many important points she brought out and I learned quite a few things from this cd, I have many of her lectures. Also, it would be sooo helpful if Ms. Myss were kind to her audience, sometimes she snaps at them rudely. It seems as though she doesn't have patience for any form of ignorance from her audience. Give them a break, they are just learning this stuff like I am and I find it fascinating."
5,Sufficiently Complicated,"I enjoy ross MacDonald because the plots are sufficiently complicated, but nonetheless logical. Throughout, the story and background are credible. They are all I look for in an interesting entertainment."
2,A so-so first book,"'Moving Target, The' is the first novel in which noir-American writer Ross McDonald introduces his most famous detective, Lew Archer. Published in 1948, in a time when noir movies was at the top, the book is just a unremarkable pulp fiction story with classic ingredients as murder, treason, much money, kidnapped and poor ladies in distress.When you read 'Moving Target, The' you feel that McDonald was very far to develop a strong and convincing work; in fact, most of the time the reader will feel the influence of some other authors hovering above Mc Donald's style. Great authors, to be sure, as Raymond Chandler, for instance.The story is just normal, and sometimes even full of flaws. But Archer is a good characther. In a way, his sympathy and easy way saves this book to be a complete misfire."
5,Excelent watch,"excelent watch, i gave this as a crhistmass present and he was shock with it. im thinking in buy one to my self..."
5,Last watch (same version/style) lasted close to 10 years,Excellent watch. My husband loves this style so we ordered the exact same watch. For the price you can not beat the value.
1,This is a forgery!!!,"There are several books with this title. I have not read all of them, but one thing is for sure, this book is a forgery. Published in 1829 supposedly translated by Flaccus Albinus Alcuinus. Nothing in this book will help anyone trying to learn more about Bible/Jewish history."
2,Disappointing,"Because of the price, I assumed this doll would be much nicer than it was. It was very run-of-the-mill; a real disappointment."
1,how many times???,How many times is this band going to release the same songs in a different order on a different cd with a different cover recorded from a different angle in a different shoddy studio??? make it stop...
1,Lame.,Spacemen Are Go! sounds like it was recorded on a hand-held microcassette recorder duct-taped to the bottom of a toilet in the back of a noisy bar. There's no way Spacemen 3 could have sanctioned this release. It makes Daniel Johnston's Homestead recordings sound like 48-track digital.
1,Fautly suction mechanism,"My wine opener worked beautifully for about four weeks. Then the suction mechanism broke. Without this, the device will not stay in place on the table and makes it impossible to use. Disappointing."
4,so it is plastic....and the point is????,"Unlike several previous reviews, the fact that this is plastic just means that it is affordable! Geez, if it were metal it certainly would not be under $20.00. Having said that, the Wine Wizard works as advertised and should last indefinatly with a little common sense. The vacum base only works when it is placed on a completely smooth service but with practice I found that I can use it without having to depend on the vacumn feature. Also I have found that if I leave the handle in the ""OPEN"" position, it is less top heavy and less likely to tip over. Bottom line, I love mine and have given several as gifts."
3,Mine broke after about 5 uses...,"The first time I used this opener I thought, ""What a great opener! The leverage is great!"" The 2nd-5th time it pushed the cork into the bottle each time and the last time I used it the adjustable neck broke.I gave it 3 stars because I fully intend to return it and perhaps the next one will work better."
3,"Nice, but be careful","First of all, its' a great price, but like the title says ""be careful"" with it. Mine broke at the vertical adjustment. If you buy this item, be sure to lift the lever straight UP (not back) and the leverage is better. This is how I broke mine (after about 20 bottles opened) It would be helpful to place the opener on a surface lower than a kitchen counter for the best leverage.I found the vacuum base so weak that I usually didn't bother with it.Would I buy this again? Probably not. Considering how much I enjoy wine, I am going to spring for a higher quality opener."
4,Cheap but functional,"The base is plastic and seems pretty cheap but I must say .. it works great. The only issue I have had with it is the suction base can take a good 3 or 4 times for it to stick. But what do you expect for under $10. I recommend this product, easy to use"
5,Meeting God in Quiet Places,"Perfect, I loved it, My daughter loved it, because she and her husbandare friends of LaGard Smith. Have stayed at his Cotswall home."
4,&#65533;Spiritual Warfare&#65533;,"""Spiritual Warfare"" by Dr. Jimmy Lowery is a clarion call to arms against the forces of evil and darkness. Clear, concise and with vivid accounts the Devil and enemy of good is exposed as the sneaky, low down, trickster ready to attack the unwary Christian or the nave who fail to take the danger of evil seriously. Well done! -----"
3,Timex Watch,"A good midsize watch, it's moderately easy to use. The day of the week is easy to miss during initial set up. Alarm function is easy to use. It does have 24-hour time which is a big plus since I work in healthcare. The pictures and description are better on the Timex website."
4,La Blue girl GOOD SERIES,"Very, Very good Hentai series. If your going to get any of the Lablue girl books, get this one or any other one as long as Maeda is the artist. The La blue girl series that isnt from Maeda is not nearly as good. I recomend this book very much"
5,Beautiful Book!,I am going to use this next year with my students. They will then make a Texas ABC book of their own. I love it!
3,"A good collection, but I expected 'Chaconne' and . . .""","It's a good collection. I wish I would've been able to see the contents before I bought it. Some of the pieces are in my general compilation books. The tableture is a great feature.I was expecting Prelude BWV 1006a and Chaconne, but still a good collection.I highly recommend this item to anyone who wants to learn Bach on guitar.But, no Chaconne and 1006a as I mentioned."
5,Bach made a little more easy...,"This book has a good selection of Bach's work...and there's a tablature under the notation music...This make things more easy...I think...If you find difficult to read notation music for the guitar, by this book...Your work will be more light..."
2,No spray top,"This item does not come with the spray top, and it is not called Spot-and-Clean Stain Cleaner. What I received might be the same stuff with a different label, but it is not what is shown. I emailed the company but got no response."
4,Pretty Good Dethatcher,I purchased this item to get a neglected yard back in shape. It does a pretty good job removing the thatch and scratching the ground without putting extra weight on it. It also pulls pretty easy. The handle is long enough to let you operate the lift without having to reach too far while driving.
4,"Well written, well played, what a guy","Winter pays for summer was wonderful...there is no doubt. It is obvious (to me), who brought Toad together. I think another TOAD album would be better than any solo project, but this album is SO enjoyable. Thank you, Joyfull noise, Anything but you...is just thoughtful song writing. I don't believe Glen will ever be able to put down his guitar and stop writing, and we should all be thankful. Thank you Glen. Your music adds emotional freedom to this world."
2,The Lone Dissenter,"Hooray, I'm the first not to give the album 5 stars. How much you like this album may depend how much you like folk music. The music lacks vigor and one may have a hard time staying awake listening to it. This is quite a contrast to any Toad the Wet Sprocket album, with its slick production and melody hooks, and even different from Phillips' last album, ""Winter Pays for Summer,"" which is somber but still a well-produced pop album. This album is very quiet and barebones, hardly ""pop"" at all - if you like that sort of thing. Still, I managed to like ""I Want a New Drug"" and ""The Next Day."" Other than that... nope."
3,Adequate but neither loud nor sturdy,"Don't get me wrong - this headset does get the job done, and is more comfortable than those atrocious ""ear buds"". This device clips on over your ear and positions the mic perhaps midway down your cheek (unless you have a really tiny face). Audio reproduction is thus adequate but tends to pick up background noise. Similarly, the speaker in the headset would probably be pretty good if it were form-fitting with your ear, but as it stands I find it hard to hear, especially when driving. (And after all, that's what you usually want the headset for, right?)My final concern would be the lightweight construction. It isn't falling apart, by any means, but I get the impression that if I accidentally sat on it - or subjected it to the sort of manhandling it'd get when tucked into my laptop bag - that it might readily be damaged.I'd still rather get a better headset, if one were available. That being said, it does do the job."
5,High Quality Component Cable.,"So I was felt the price was a little insane but I got some better graphic quality out of my games and that's what I wanted. I think with my current game selection it does not show as much since the current selection I have was not particularly designed for this, but I am content."
5,Beautiful collection!,"It is true that this recording has some additional works that do not feature Sumi Jo's voice, but this did not bother me in the least. All of the pieces on this album are performed with great musicality and depth of expression. A real treat for those who enjoy Sumi Jo's brilliant bel canto voice and vocal masterworks that are not often performed."
2,what a disappointment!,I personally like Sumi Jo's voice but this album is a huge disappointment. It is clear that she is just trying to put out yet another album without putting much effort into it.
2,Please show us more respect here!,Personally I like Sumi Jo but this album is a huge disappointment as it seems that she is just trying to put out yet another album. I am very disappointed.
1,never even was sent to me after I ordered it,"This company is terrible. I waited and waited for this thing to come so my teenage daughter would STAY OFF my computer, and we could get hers working better. I waited for TWO weeks before this company responded to my email ""sorry, this was never in stock."" All this after I ordered it, got an order number, had my amazon card charged etc!!!!!!!! DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS PLACE!I now have to start all over again, finding a new place to buy this difficult-to-find memory stick.THANKS FOR NOTHING!"
3,"Good, Could Be Better!",The transfers are professional and good looking all the way. The selection of episodes is very good as well. My only beef that you should get more episodes for the money. These 12 episodes cost more than the whole 5th season of 'Make Room For Daddy' (6 Discs 33 episodes). Why not put 3 episodes of each show on? It would seem a better deal then and I'm sure I would have given 5 stars.
5,Great recipes!,"I bought this cookbook a while ago and have really enjoyed it. Everything I've made has been quite tasty, and many recipes have been excellent. I really like that they included comments from their website, because often the comments will include variations on the recipes, as well as what others especially liked about the recipe. There are a wide variety of recipes, from appetizers and beverages to main dishes, breakfast items, and deserts. Some use everyday ingredients, but there are also recipes that are a little fancier, so it's a really nice mix. I would definitely add this one to your collection--I use it all the time to cook for my family--plenty of child-friendly recipes, too!"
5,"Three ""Keeper"" Recipes the First Week","I own a LOT of cookbooks (more than 400) and am both a serious home cook and an inveterate ""arm chair"" cook. Some cookbooks are great for reading; some are great for cooking. A very few are great for both. This one fits in the latter category. But even more importantly, EVERY recipe I've tried from this book during the first week I owned it, deserved to go into my ""keeper"" box--things I'll make again and again and that I would be proud to serve not just to my family, but to guests. If you are going to own only one Southern Living cookbook (which I do not advise; the more of these you own, the better a home cook you are likely to be!), make it this one."
2,Plasma Lamp,"I was disappointed with this little lamp. I though it had a red background which it doesn't. I would not recommend or purchase this product again. Although it does react like the other plasma lamp I have, in fact the coloring of them are the same."
3,Missing Details,"This book has a good history and digital video section. The book should be called Digital Video Demystified, it is lacking the disc part of the DVD. He does cover the digital video and authoring parts of the process, but only a little bit of the ROM process. He barely touches on disc production or play mode. This book does not give all the details of the DVD format. It is a good book for anyone that is in authoring or cares to know how Digital Video is made, but after that he is missing it."
4,Good book but outdated by today standards,I read this book some years ago ... it is pretty good. But as technology has changed now it is outdated.
1,Don't Use One Word Where 20 Will Do,"Don't be fooled by the size of this book. It is 90% irrelevances and padding. For example does it really need a discussion on whether the word ""disk"" should end with a ""c"" or a ""k""? The diagrams are difficult to follow, mainly due to their mistakes, and I did not find enough technical information for the book to be of any use whatsoever."
2,Not all There,"This book is not all there. He misses many points about DVD and makes many mistakes. His mistakes range from why a CD-R can't play in a DVD player to the effects of Jitter. He does explain the pre-production process well, but misses on the production process. There is also more to testing a disc then watching the video and audio. If a disc is of poor quality from the manufacturing process it can cause play problems that he is not even aware of nor states in his book. By the way he has written this book you can tell what information he has and what he doesn't."
2,DVD Demystified Maybe two years ago,"The search continues for a truly up-to-date review on the technology relevant to DVD players. Whether for home audio/video use or for computer DVD drives and burners, this book is out of date by almost two years due to the fast paceof DVD drive technology. High time for the Third Edition."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH ALL PHONES!!!,"It says it works with all phones, but it dosn't!! In fact it dosen't even fit any of my friends phones! I have a ""V series 2397 motorola"". I've not been able to find the correct adapter anywhere on the web or in town. I've tried everything, I'm almost going to give up on this issue. - Micxz"
1,Bogus,"BEWARE - Amazon allows bogus book reviews. In case you have not noticed, the first 5-star review is from the author himself, and the second is from an author they got to endorse the book cover. This brings the average review up close to a 5, regardless of the 1-star comment from an objective reader. Ridiculous!"
3,A very good and cautelous reading apocriphal book,"I have never heard about Enoch, until I read the Bible, and the Bible says in Jude 14 a reference to this apocryphal book. The book of prophet Enoch describes wonderful things about the past, when Adam & Eve have not been here in this world. You must pray before reading, is just a sugestion."
1,No longer among my favorites,"EQ used to be one of my favorite works, but the series no longer has the quality it once enjoyed. My advice is to avoid later volumes and stick to the earlier books which are among the best comics ever published. The later work is embarassing."
1,Not nearly Pini quality,"When Wendy Pini stopped drawing, the life went out of her characters. The storyline began to drift from being fresh and exciting to the type found in dime romance novels - the same thing over and over again. At the time this was first published, there was a great cry from long-term Elfquest readers stating that the art and story were deteriorating and the response from Richard Pini was that they were ""going to take all the negative letters and put them in a blender."" When fans stopped buying the new artists' work, Wendy began to draw again (see ""Dreamtime"") but I wonder if she can truly salvage what has been lost. The beginning of the death of the Elfquest Universe, sadly, is in this book."
3,An ok representation,"I know that for die-hard Elfquest fans, the turn to other artists is difficult. Shards is a prime example of the shift to more comic book-like writing and art. It will never compare to the original Series 1-8. However, I had prepared myself for this when, after 5 years of not picking up an Elfquest, I decided to start back up with the series. Expecting the unfamiliar style of art, as from Worldpool, I was pleasantly surprised at the art in Shards. The characters were recognizable and often strikingly like Pini's work. Her art was mixed in and it made for an adaquate and enjoyable read. Although we would all love for Wendy to be doing it all, I think this will do. But I really hope the movie is worth all this!!"
1,Do they write their good reviews themselves,"I can only assume the Pini's are writing the glowing reviews of the EQ graphic novels themselves. These books are so bad, so badly drawn, so awful, with such lousy reproduction and quality control that I can't imagine any EQ fan actually likes them.The art looks like it came from a fanzine. It is not professional. The reproduction of the art looks like mud.Buy at your own risk."
5,Fun and smart,"Sometimes reading is just about being entertained. Sometimes it's more than that and Book Club by Curtis Bunn was more than just entertainment. It really is a smart book with very interesting characters with a lot on their minds. It's kind of amazing a man can write so realistically about a woman's thoughts and motivations. I'm really impressed.This book gives you a message -- five of them actually. And they all are like life lessons to hold on to after you finish the book. And when you finish you'll be tempted to start over and read the stories again.For me, someone who reads every single day and every single genre, that's the tale-tell sign of a good, intelligent book.Cynthia Martin, Chicago"
4,A Must for Tourists to Mexico,"This valuable guide is a must for anyone wanting information on Mexico. There are many easy to read, easy to find indexes, and maps of specific cities and points of interest. If you're headed on a road trip south, this needs to go with you. All the roads are clearly marked, with a brief introduction to the major cities of interest."
1,NOT GOOD!,"This is not a ""kaleidoscope"" of colors. It is red, green, blue, period. It stays red most of the time, then green, blue, for about a second each, then red again for 20-30 seconds. I'm very disappointed with this product."
3,This company sucks,"The two CD set is great BUT note that this is volume 3. Guess what...it's the exact same as volume 1!!!!! Different cover, one less CD, exact same order song list. TICK ME OFF!!! I could have spent my money on something I didn't have. I plan on boycotting the maker. Buy volume 1. You get the extra CD, even though that CD isn't that good."
3,would have been a winner except for the echo,"Easy to take on and off (once you figure it out!), and usually stays in place. However, if my ear is sweaty or oily (a lovely thought, I know), it tends to slide around my ear. For the most part I had no problems hearing the other party and other people never had a problem hearing me. Background noise from being inside a car didn't affect the quality of sound that was transmitted.The biggest problem I found was that most people I talked to complained that they heard their own voice echoed back at them. This was not something that I could hear on my end but I verified it when I had someone call me using this headset. This is *very* annoying for the person being called."
1,Didn't work for me...,"I tried, for quite a while, to get used to this headset. I liked the fact that it had a mike that came close to your mouth and didn't dangle. First of all, I found the earpiece very, very difficult to get on. Second, once on, it would slip so that the mic was moving away from my face and the ear piece was moved away from my ear, eventually falling off. And, finally, when I would get it to stay, it hurt the outside of my ear.To be fair, I know other people who use this and like it alot. Maybe I just have larger ears, but, it just didn't work for me."
4,Nicer than expected.,"This is a very nice cleaning kit for the money. I took it to the range for cleaning the barrel breaking in a new rifle and experienced no problems with any of the equipment. I believe this is the best you can do for this price range. The box is a bit small, but if you put the rug somewhere else, you can fit everything you need in it."
5,"dude, it's nausea","nausea is probably one of the best crust bands to ever emerge. extinction reigns as one of the greatest, if not the greatest lp's to be released. it doesn't get any better than this."
3,"A good reference, but need further revision","The approach taken by this book is neither too mathematical, which makes the subject untractable, nor too engineering-lized, which missed out important insights. I am an engineer with a master degree in mechanical engineering. I found this book very readable, given enough coffine and a good mood. The subjects covered are self-contained.However this book needs further improvement to be called classic. First, contact-impact chapter is palely presented. LS-DYNA theory manual provides a more complete description on this subject. Secondly, typos need to be reduced. Thirdly, the language is somewhat boring. Fourthly, I would like to see a Latex-ized version of this book."
1,Worst book,"This is one of the worst books on FEA. The notation is terrible. Dont waste your money. Get Bonet and Wood, an excellent one on this topic."
4,Learning nonlinear FEA?,"This is not an easy book. Nevertheless it is worth the price as it presents a detailed and rigorous treatment of nonlinear solid mechanics and how it can be implemented in finite element analysis. Some of the material covered is better understood if one has other references to compare with(e.g. Bonet and and Woods)Comparing both books, Belitschko is more comprehensive and detailed but in some aspects Bonet and Woods book is simpler and easier to understand. It helps to have both.For those who are new to the field, like me (Untill know I have been dealing all the time with linear static analysis and geometric nonlinearity) it takes more than a reading to become familiar with the subject. Jumping to Bonet and Jones a few times helped a lot in understanding Belytschko."
2,Less than satisfactory,"This book looks much more like a collection of research papers thatthe authors put together than a book which could profit the student population.They are other books in the market that are more succint and to the point in approaching the topic of non linearity, a good buy remainthe two books of the late M.A.Crisfield"
2,Not Factory Finish,"Just received my stereo install kit for my 2006 Volkswagen Jetta.Not too happy with this product at all. While i didn't expect it to match my dash exactly this isn't even close.The VW dash is a soft rubber material, this is a hard ugly plastic.I am not sure whether to install it or to sell it locally (if I can find someone who wants an ugly dash)."
1,This is our second explosive gas detector.,"After about a year our first monitor started going off and each time we called the gas co. They came and did a check and said everything was ok. The second time it went off we called the next day and they came out again and checked every line and everything. They even left a very expensive system to monitor the house for a week. NO problems. I called the company of the gas monitor and they said we had a problem, and should get out of the house and call 911, but after I explained we had it checked out and it's done it twice, she sent me out a new one; we have had it for 6 months and now the new one is doing the same thing as the first one did. She said they are very sensitive and at the time the monitor was going off we must have had a problem. I give up. You should be able to trust them as an accurate device."
2,Too many scary false alarms,"I had nothing but problems with this unit and eventually threw it away (wish I had read the reviews and called Kiddie to get it replaced). If the power went out, it would alarm. If I used hairspray two rooms away, it would alarm. If I used the stove or something burned on a unit, it would alarm. The final straw was during a power outage at about 2:00 am when it went off and, not knowing what to do, I called 911 and had the fire department come out. There was no explosive gas or CO at all. It was just blaring for no reason."
2,GAS EXPLOSION DETECTED,"WOW, was I scared out of my pants last night! I have this Nighthawk detector and the alarm sounded at 10pm. The detector indicated ""Gas"" with a number of 288. I called 911 and the fire department came. They found nothing that would make the alarm go off. I checked the internet and discovered that this detector gives false alarms. I went out and bought a different one. Need to take that detector off the market!!!!! You are scaring people to death.."
2,I doubt this thing will detect anything,"This device sits 1 1/2 feet from my gas stove. I can leave a burner on (unlit) for over an hour and this thing won't sound. I know this because it happened. Well not on purpose but yea, it happened. But if I create too much steam from boiling water the damn thing wont shut up; I ended throwing it out into the yard just so I wouldn't have to listen to it."
4,CO2/Gas Detector,Easy to install and seems to pass all tests without problem. It is convenient that one can mount the detector at the proper height in a room. I will only know if it really works when I have a gas or CO2 problem.
2,Concerns,I returned this item unopened. Unfortunately I read reviews of this item after I ordered it. Many reviews stated that the gas part of this unit went off regularly incorrectly. I was going to live with false alarms. By law all explosive gas must have a detectable odor additive when delivered to a home and my wife has a wonderful nose.
1,Constant False Alarms,"We've had this combo unit for about a year and about every month it goes off with the ""explosive gas"" alarm (for methane and propane, neither of which is present in our house).It's a very loud and piercing alarm, but it will not turn off even though we hit the reset button - we have to unplug it from the wall and take out the 9 volt battery to stop the alarm. We would let ours sit for a few minutes, then re-plug it in outside - the alarm would still go off on 'explosive gas'. Yikes - it's like a cry-wolf alarm - we'll never know when to trust it."
1,Most stupid thing I've seen in my life,"1. Battery dies in about 1 month even it is always on wall plug. When battery dies, it alarms no matter when. So be aware that you may have to get up at midnight to buy/change battery for it.2. It is very sensitive to cosmetics and wines. When my wife applies some certain cosmetics, it always alarms. When we gather together with friends for some alcohol, it alarms too.3. It is very insensitive to carbon monoxide. We once had some problem with our gas stove. The smell was so bad that we all evacuated, but this stupid thing was as silent as a rock.So buy it if you:1. like to get up any time when you are asleep.2. never let any one drinks or uses cosmetics to get into your house.3. don't mind that it doesn't detect carbon monoxide."
1,False GAS alarm,"Our alarm registered a GAS reading of 235 this afternoon. After resetting and moving to a different floor, the unit continued to beep. We called the fire Department and after they toured the house, we were told that all was fine. False alarm!Our unit was manufactured in 2007. The fireman told us that after the 5 year mark, we should replace the alarm. However, after reading the other reviews, I believe that this particular unit is too prone to false gas alarms. We will be replacing with a standard CO2 alarm."
1,"False alarms... If you want a rude awakening in the middle of the night, buy this!","I bought one of these from Home Depot thinking a CO AND Natural Gas detector was better than just CO.Heck no.4 or 5 False alarms later that woke me up in the middle of the night and SCARED the heck out of me, I came online and read that EVERY other review says the same thing.Just go for a straight carbon monoxide detector. The GAS detector is hypersensitive and sets off false alarms WAY to much to be useful."
2,False Alarms,"Seemed to work great, until false alarms started going off. I had this detector for about 18 months before I started getting false GAS alarms. At first I thought my fireplace may be leaking propane. I shut off the gas, aired out the house, and left it go because the warm season is here. Even though the gas was off for several days, (at the wall and the tank) the alarm started going off again shortly after walking into the house after work. I know there was no gas buildup because I didn't smell the scent that is in with the gas, the windows were open, and the gas is off! Oh well. Time to try a new brand. Sorry Kidde."
1,Absolute Junk,"As with most others posting reviews, mine throws false gas alarms. A false alarm at midnight and a visit from the fire department will keep me from buying any Kidde products in the future."
2,Annoying GAS alarm goes off after about a year of use.,"Bought this before we moved into our home as we had gas heat, water heat and stove. This was a nice unit and we did have one instance where gas was detected and then about the one year anniversary it started beeping with the GAS alarm, despite the windows being open and no stove use and no smell. I reset the battery moved the unit to another room that is not near the kitchen or utility room and received the same reading. After doing this I removed the battery and replaced with an all new, the same thing. I will be looking for a better unit that is more reliable."
1,False alarms,"It's 1AM and it just went off due to a false alarm, this is the second time it has happened in a few months."
1,CUSTOMER SUPPORT RUNNING AWAY FROM RESPONSIBILITY,FALSE ALARM ALL THE TIME - ALWAYS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.7 UNITS LATER - SAME THING WITH ALL OF THEM.REMEMBER ABOUT 5 YEARS WARRANTY - CALL 1800-880-6788 FOR A REPLACEMENT ( SEND THE OLD UNITS BACK FIRST )IF ONE CUSTOMER REP HANGS UP ON YOU OR SAY BUY NEW ONE - CALL AGAIN AND TALK TO DIFFERENT REP.OTHERWISE - DON'T BUT THIS UNIT...
1,False Alarms -,"Fortunately, Kidde customer service has responded well to our false alarm problem with the GAS side of these devices.Now on our third, the other two each lasted about a year before giving us false GAS alarms, this one is up only about 2 months and here we go again!This time, I asked Kidde if they would replace the unit with the Carbon Monoxide ONLY product... They were kind enough to do so.Thank goodness Kidde stands behind their products with representatives trained to listen and respond to consumer issues."
1,Gives false alarms - waste of $60,"The explosive gas part of this detector has given us several false alarms (very disturbing in the middle of the night). We just had the gas company come and make sure we don't have a gas leak and the gas man said he sees false positives on these combo units all the time. He recommends a CO only detector. Gas has an odor so unless you have no sense of smell, you can tell if you have a leak. We threw out our $60 Nighthawk and will buy a CO only detector now."
1,Too many GAS false alarms,"I purchased this product instead of a CO only detector for the peace of mind of having an explosive gas detector. The problem is too many false alarms. The unit goes off for no reason which can be very disturbing. Stick with a CO only alarm, and use your nose to detect gas leaks."
1,Flawed Design - Eats Batteries,"Product has potential, but has a serious design flaw that makes it a battery eater. When you lose commercial power, the battery backup takes over as it should. The problem is that when power returns, the unit will continue to run off of the battery until you manually ""reset"" it. Even worse, there's NO INDICATOR to show you its running off of battery power, so you never know that it needs to be reset. Only when you start getting the ""LO BATT"" indicator do you realize its been sitting there on battery power for who knows how long. By then, its too late and all you can do is feed it another battery. Finally got tired of wasting batteries so I no longer use the device. Stay away."
1,FALSE ALARMS A-PLENTY,"DO NOT BUY this piece of junk. False alarms regularly. Gives readings of 3 times the ""lethal"" levels of gas, when there is NO gas present. If, for the sake of argument, the gas detector was accurate, wouldn't you want it to go off before reaching that high a level? It's NOT just sensitive, it is a piece of crap. Do a little research before you buy a detector, you'll find many issues with this one. I wish I had done that research before buying."
3,Battery eater,"Even you plug this thing into the electrical outlet you have to put a battery in it for a backup in case of power failure. The thing justs eats batteries even when it is plugged in. After one month after putting a battery in it. It ends up chirping in the middle of the night to let me know it has a low battery. I thought I just take the battery out and plug it back in. No it continuely chirps even when it is plugged in, so I have to end up pulling the plug. That is the reason I bought it so I didn't have to buy batteries."
2,Batter Killer,"I have had two of these units in the last 8 years. The product life is 7 to 8 years per Kidde, the manufacturer. After 7+ years of use they will go on ""Err"" error and will not reset but must be replaced. Both units tended to drain and kill 9V backup batteries rather quickly; i.e. 2 weeks to 6 months. This happened while constantly connected to AC with no apparent reason. The battery low chirp noise always seemed to happen in the wee-small hours of the morning on a workday. If you purchase it, I hope yours is kinder to backup batteries than my two units.Kidde KN-COPP-3 Nighthawk Plug-In Carbon Monoxide Alarm with Battery Backup and Digital Display"
1,Constant False Alarms,It's garbage. I have two of these and they randomly give false alarms. They're absolutely false alarms since I keep them close (since they're useless anyway) and only one will go off (usually in the middle of the night). I'd heard Nighthawk was the best. This unit is a joke. Buy anything else or simply flush $60 down the toilet for the same result.
1,Many false alarms,I've had the same problem with this Kiddie combination CO/explosive gas detector mentioned by other reviewers: sporadic false alarms for explosive gas. I'm tossing this piece of junk and buying a CO-only detector.
2,False alarms all the time,"... cannot use hair spray, spray cleaner near this. I rarely use hairspray, but on those occasions I do, I either have to go down to the garage (3 flights) or close the door of the bedroom that is on the same level as the alarm and spray my hair at the window. Normally I could live with this, but my dog is sometimes alone and this thing really freaks her out when we ARE home with her and the thing goes off."
2,Frustrating and buggy,"Device is too riddled with problems. If there's a false alarm, or the battery's dead, you can't shut it up. Annoying, buggy, and the 3-digit display doesn't give you enough information to know what to do. The battery cover keeps falling-off and is annoying to put back on. I would suggest getting another brand."
1,Started giving false gas alarms after two years,"As the other reviewers noted, out unit began giving false gas alarms after we had owned it for two years. I can't even really remark on whether this unit worked properly beforehand or not. Since we haven't had an emergency, for all we know, it worked perfectly until recently or never worked at all."
1,Had a serious gas leak: no alarm,"I could live with the few false alarms we had with our unit - but in January, when a knob on our natural gas stove had been left partially ""on"" - I came home to a house sickeningly filled with gas - and the Nighthawk blithely read ""0 PPM"". No alarm - not a peep. It was by the Grace of God that my house didn't explode when I flipped on the light switch before I smelled the gas. An hour after opening all the doors and windows, our utility technician arrived - and her ""gas sniffer"" went crazy - it was still reading 4% concentration of gas. I'm sure the initial concentration had been 3+ times that much.If my light switch had sparked - I could have been killed. For this unit to NOT have sounded any kind of alarm is truly scary."
3,Cooking with wine sets it off!,"We have had this detector for 4 years with no problems. We have it located our basement furnace room. All went well until I tried a recipe for Coq Au Vin (Chicken With Wine). The first part of the recipe is the marinade - cooking the chicken for about 10 minutes in wine and veggies. The GAS alarm went off. I checked our furnace room and didn't smell any gas. We turned off the furnace and opened the windows. I called my furnace guy and he couldn't find any problems. We called our utility company and he used a gas sensor and didn't find any leaks. I figured it was just an anomaly. The next night, while cooking the Coq Au Vin, the alarm went off again. After several heated moments attempting to convince my husband all was well (HECK, you know when you have a gas leak!), I went online and read these reviews. Whew! I cook with wine/alcohol frequently, but this recipe required a full bottle of red wine. Well, now I know. Just wish I had read these reviews sooner."
1,False Alarm Device is what this is,"This things has caused too much panic. Gas alarm was going crazy so I rush home, have the kids and wife with the doors open in the sub zero temps and find out that the gas was going off due to my wife cooking with wine. Oh yes, this was the second and final false alarm. First time was after the fire department showed up and found nothing. Found out that a Lysol spray during cleaning set it off. (just google similar questions)DON""T get these multi-sensor alarms. Stick with the CO2 only.Oh, and calling Kidde got me to someone saying the unit was defective, and I should send it back for replacement. They would not even offer to cross ship, so the company thats trying to sell products to save my life is ok with me not having their product while I ship it back. The irony!"
1,False Alarm,"Just finished up with a dramatic afternoon visit from the Atmos gas man. After my unit was screaming ""GAS"" for a while and saying 216 PPM CO, I figured it was a real emergency. The unit in my basement about 20 feet away from my hot water heater. My wife was taking a shower at the time, and the heater was on. I figured it was the real deal.Long story short, Atmos sent a guy out within 20 minutes, who did a battery of tests on the gas lines, meters, and even took a longer look at my water heater than my plumber does. He spent well over an hour diagnosing things, using his professional meters, recreating the same conditions, etc. The only possible cause was a faulty meter.DO NOT BUY THIS CRUMMY METERThe one good thing was that the Atmos guy wrote the issue up as an outside gas meter replacement - not a faulty meter - so he didn't charge me anything! And he spent lots of time explaining everything to me. Go Atmos!"
4,Safety first,"This was a gift for our college-aged daughter. She lives in a basement apartment, this gives her and us peace of mind. Easy to install and reliable company."
1,Kidde will throw it in the trash!,"Wow, I called Kidde to see if I could send it back to have it worked on or recalibrated...they said don't bother because they just throw it in the trash. So much for customer service and standing behind your own product. The lady said dog gas and human gas could make it set off. I said there are no dogs and my husband is at sleep in the middle of the night when the thing goes off. She said cleaners, candles (even unlit), furniture polish, nail polish could make the alarm go off. Then she said I should be calling the gas company. I said if it was gas I could smell it and there was no smell. Totally ridiculous. And I could have taken it back to Lowes or Home Depot if my hubby had kept the receipt. What a waste and so expensive too."
1,It does not work,"I read multiple reviews of users commenting of false alarms. Apparently Kidde has done the opposite now. It lower the sensitivity to a point where the product it not just useless but, it endangers lives by creating a false sense of security.In our case, we did have a gas leak in the laundry room. After smelling it, I moved the Kidde detector to the room to check the readings. Nothing!I figured the smell was similar to gas but not quite. It took us a week of feeling sick and having headaches before we called the gas company.I do not recommend this product to anyone"
2,False Alarms,"I bought this item for a home we purchased last summer. It worked fine for about 9 months until we started getting false alarms for Explosive Gas (as others have noted). We also called the gas company and they did not detect any leaks. Enough odorant is added to natural gas that one can smell it--during the false alarms, we didn't smell anything. The alarm is VERY loud and will wake you, which is reassuring. We're switching to a CO model only and giving this model to my dad for use in his home in Mexico which may not have the same code requirements as homes in the US."
2,False Alarms,"We've had this unit since 2007. Up until recently it seemed to be working fine (no false alarms). Lately, however, we get false alarms repeatedly. When we cook with any type of wine or vermuth we have to unplug the unit or it will sound. Just as others attest, this unit will sound if anyone passes gas near it. It also sounds when you use hand sanitizer anywhere in its vicinity. I am contacting Kidde to see if they will exchange it for just the CO2 product."
1,False alarm on Christmas Eve!!!,"So it's Christmas eve, I'm cooking prime rib, just about done with dinner, when the alarm goes off. We evacuate our home (after turning off our electric stove) call 911, fire dept comes out and...Drum Roll please....a false alarm! On Christmas Eve! Then I decide to google the model number and find all these horrible reviews. Well I guess I can't say this wasn't an exciting Christmas."
2,False alarms,"I purchased this combo unit because I wanted a good unit that I wouldn't have to replace every other year. What I received was a unit that gave me explosive gas false alarms in the middle of the night. Since I work as a cumbustion engineer and knew that based on the fact that there was no smell, there was no chance that I was in a hazordous situation. It spent a number of nights in the garage so that I could go back to sleep."
3,Explosive Gas False Alarms,This is the 2nd Kidde Carbon Monoxide/Explosive Gas detector I've had. The first one kept having false alarms for explosive gas. Kidde was kind enough to replace it with a new one a couple years ago.I am now having false gas alarms again. I am in touch with Kidde about getting a carbon monoxide detector instead. I am hoping things will go smoothly with customer service again this time around.Update: Kidde customer service is excellent and gave me the carbon monoxide only detector.
5,Safty and Peace of mind,"After installing the new gas fireplace in the room, this item is bought and used to monitor. Product design makes plug in easy and easy to read. Amazon's price is much better than anywhere else."
4,Cat Urine?,"I cannot vouch for the effectiveness of this item in detecting explosive gasses, however, it does seem quite capable of detecting cat urine. We had mounted ours about three or four feet above a litter box and if our did not cover after peeing in the box, the explosive gas alarm would go off. Simply relocating the detector to another outlet in the room solved that problem but we thought it was interesting nonetheless."
1,Avoid Like the Plague,"Seriously, avoid this product and buy another Kidde detector. I bought this unit, because I liked the digital display, but it has a serious product defect.This unit gives a ton of false gas alarms. I'm not sure why Kidde doesn't recall all of them. After having this detector for a few months, I eventually just stopped using it and bought another."
1,Did not detect leak,We have a version that has carbon monoxide and explosive gas detection. We had a leak in the same room as the alarm and it did not detect anything. Do not be too reliant on this.
1,Too many false alarms,"As most others seem to have been experienced, this detector frequently has false alarms. Not too much more too say that hasn't already been said in several of the other 1 star reviews. Look elsewhere for a reliable detector that won't wake you up in the middle of the night."
1,False Alarms Galore,"I've owned two of these units, and both had problems with false alarms. They are particularly sensitive to spray products that have a smell, like perfume, cologne, and cleaning products. The remaining unit I have now instantly alerts to GAS every time I plug it in, so I was forced to go out and buy a different unit today - which gave me an all clear."
1,What a wake up call!,"If you enjoy waking up and thinking your life and your family's life is in danger please buy this. When we first bought this it worked fine. After 8 or 9 months it started going off with a GAS warning every couple of months...and then it became more frequent. We got scared at first and kept trying to replace the battery it helped for a while, but then it didn't help at all. This was not worth the money we paid for it."
3,Is the warranty pre programmed?,I must say I have only had 2 false alarms with this unit. I bought a Honeywell gas detector as a backup. At just about 5 years and a few days I got a gas detected alarm.. I used the Honeywell to check and it was a false alarm. Is this thing programmed to go off at 5 years when the warranty expires?
1,Too many false alarms for explosive gas,"Everytime I make a curry dish or one using beer, the alarm sounds and I have to throw it outside to make it stop. The first time I thought I should be worried, now I ignore it. Remember that parable about crying wolf? Don't buy it!"
1,Just chucked it in the garbage,"Well, it's 2:17am and I'm typing this in bed. Since I'm wide awake after ANOTHER false alarm, I have to find something to do to get tired again. My Kidde is lying in the garbage, back cover ripped off, battery pulled out. Maybe they should stop making gas alarms and turn their efforts towards alarm clocks. I guarantee you'll never sleep through it. I could care less if their customer service backs it or would exchange it for just a CO detector; any company that makes this crappy of a product will not get the chance to make amends with me.Ok, well, I'm off to other random web sites in a vain effort to shake off the cold sweats and ringing ears the Kidde gave me for no good reason. Unless you like loud screeching false alarms in the dead of the night, avoid this POS like the plague."
1,Too many false gas alarms.,"The title says it all. What good is this thing to anyone if it constantly false alarms? To make matters worse, the first few times it happened I would unplug it and then realize I also had to take the time to remove the battery. So, I'd get a nice dose of high decibel sound at point blank range for a few extra seconds while I fumbled with it. What a waste of money. I like most others on here will be going with a CO only device."
2,Dog farts set off explosive gas alarm,"It was like something from a comedy, the dog sleeping next to the detector sets off the explosive gas alarm every few nights when she lets one rip towards the unit plugged into the hallway outlet. Although, at 4am, it isn't so funny. We will have to replace this unit with a Carbon Monoxide ONLY detector or replace the bulldog with a less gassy breed."
1,Absolute crap!,"More false alarms please! I bought this a couple years ago, it was replaced once after the fire department arrived at my house because of a false alarm. Now, false alarms are nearly a weekly occurrence. Absolutely the worst device I currently own! Buy something else!"
1,Piece of Junk!!,"Amazon should add a ZERO-star rating. False ""gas"" alarms have averaged every 4-6 weeks during the year we've owned this detector. Air fresheners, food cooking, and pee diapers have all caused alarms in addition to random alarms without any obvious cause. The gas company confirmed no leaks on multiple occasions. This product is headed to the dump. Don't waste your money!!"
1,Just had a false gas alarm,"We just had an explosive gas alarm tonight. I picked up the baby and ran out of the house into the 27 degree night, the fire dept came out and found nothing wrong. I decided to see if there were any reviews on this unit. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this. I don't want to throw it out just in case it does detect gas one day, hopefully there won't be any more false alarms. I know gas has a smell, but I used to live in an apt. before where there was a gas leak and I didn't know it, so I'm sort of paranoid now. The fire dept. gave us a new battery so we'll see. Why can't anyone make a reliable gas detector?"
1,Had two of these - both failed,"I have owned two of these devices. I got rid of each of them because of false alarms with the gas detector. I tried unplugging it and waiting, but the gas alarm continued to sound. I tried vacuuming the unit, but still no help. I'm going with a CO-only detector this time. I have used the Nighthawk CO-only detector in the past and was happy with it. I wish that I had not switched to the CO/gas detector."
2,...You're Kidding,"On page 5, the author admits that he just discovered the difference between grilling and BBQ'ing. What? And he is from the South? Aside from spending the first 20 pages on non-rib essentials (like a full page describing an Apron), I found that the best part of the book was the last 12 pages describing prepared, retail, bottled BBQ sauces. The tone of the center piece pages is set by a picture of pulling ribs out of boiling water. Yuck! While he admits that boiling is not the preferred way of cooking, he suggests that you can produce acceptable ribs in this fashion. I'm sorry, but I'm looking for a much more professional treatment of rib cooking from an expert..."
2,Nothing special,"Here in the deep south, cooking ribs is something of a religious experience. I had to dismiss this book as soon as the author discussed boiling ribs. Boiling ribs is a sacrilige! Any experienced outdoor cook can tell you that - and they can also tell if ribs have been boiled (or parboiled, if you will) prior to placing them in the cooker. Other than this, the other items in the book are common to many other cookbooks. So, there is nothing new or special in this book."
4,enjoyed it !!,"i read this book in about three hours i liked it so much.the story moved along nicely, no page after page of dragging out story lines that make your head spin. the hero of the story was like a real person, flaws and all.he had been hurt and betrayed so it was not easy to put his trut in just any one.the heroine wanted what most of us want, love to last a lifetime and security. this is a great night read if youre like me and if you get into a book that is pretty good you dont want to put it down until youre done. iv read almost all of her books and seem to enjoy them all. i would definatly recomend for a decent love story."
1,Uneven,"The plot was very promising and I really wanted to like this book, but the writing threw me off. It was very uneven and awkward. Bad writing effectively ruins it for me, no matter how good a plot. I hope this book isn't indicative of the rest of this author's work, because right now, she is definitely on my ""to avoid"" list. The reviewer below who said her writing is choppy and has no eloquence was spot-on."
4,Another wonderful read from Gayle Callen!,Gayle Callen once again demonstrates her creative storytelling talent!
5,Every American Parents' Required Reading,"In today's world, we look at serving in the military as a second class job, but what about the heritage of our country, the growth and confidence of our families and their children and/or husbands.This book reminds us of our military heritage, that it used to be honorable to serve in our military, and the foundation serving in our military can give a person entering today's global world.An enlightening book in today's negative world regarding serving in the military, our government, and serving our country.The book shows the negative perception since Vietnam to Iraq, but gives examples of people that have grown through our military into our government. We need more examples of these quality, dedicated, honest people in our government."
3,"Can the U.S. military really survive a large dose of ""elite""?","Since it went all-volunteer, the U.S. military has become the most effective in the world. Our other ""elites,"" however, have been in steady decline. Do we really want the offspring of the people who made the New York Times, CIA and Harvard what they are today to do for the military what they did to those institutions? Come to think of it, it wasn't so long ago that we had a greater coerced ""elite"" membership in the military - during Vietnam. Do we really want more of that?"
4,An Interesting Perspective,"This book offers an interesting perspective on why there seems to be a disconnect between the US Military and the upper/ruling class of the United States. Lately, it seems that a sure fire way to make your way into public service (read, political office) is to have plenty of financial backing. With that said, the majority of political offices in this country are held by members of a more privileged class who have little or no connection with the military. This lack of connection and the effects of such a disconnect are highlighted and discussed in this book. No matter what part of society you come from, I highly recommend reading this outstanding work."
1,"WARNING - This ""gem"" does not run on Windows XP","I was delighted to find this little gem of a ""living history"" CD for our study of the decades of the 20th Century - until I tried to actually use it. No matter how ""compatible"" the CD claims to be, it does not run on Windows XP - even after several frustrating hours of tracking down and applying all of the various fixes provided somewhere by DK.I've been unable to find any other equivalent product and would instead recommendLIFE: Our Century in Pictures for Young Peoplefor classroom use."
3,Tells it like it is...that's the problem.,"Anyone expecting a ""true"" version of ""Hunt for Red October"" will be sadly disappointed. Author Dunham took his secrecy oath seriously -- even though the a lay reader will soon figure out that the ship in question is the USS Halibut, Dunham won't even reveal the ship's true name. ""Blind Man's Buff"" has revealed many of the details that Dunham kept secret, that of a mission to locate and photograph the wreckage of a sunken Soviet missile submarine.Reviewers below have slammed this book because it's not exciting enough. The truth is, this IS daily submarine life--lots of boredom and tedium, and occasional moments of sheer terror. Andrew Karam's book ""Rig Ship for Ultra Quiet"" is a better-written look at the silent service, but Dunham's book does have its place."
5,a page turner,"I served twenty years in the surface Navy, but I never served on a submarine, so this book taught me new and interesting things in addition to taking me back to some familiar places and situations. It's very well written, easy to read; if I were younger, and if my eyes did not get tired so quickly, I could have read through this book easily in one day."
3,Al-right,"This book was alright. It was an easy read but I was facinated at what actually happened during the Cold War under the sea. I liked Blind Man's Bluff more than this, but this is still a good read."
1,"Please, save your money!","Is it possible to give a ""no star"" rating? Poorly written and researched, this is a book to be missed! Save your money and time. Avoid this book at all costs."
1,The secret should be out... it's bad.,"This book is all about secrets, the secrets you keep to yourself after you've bought it: Why did I do it? What could I have done with the money? How many trees died for this one? This book's cover isn't too misleading, because it is apparent that no one will say what the big deal was with this submarine. It is boring, and will have you reading the White Pages for something more enlightening. It is unsophisticated, which makes for an easy read. That may be its saving grace-- it won't take long to finish, keeping your brain from rotting entirely. There is nothing to see here; instead, look for an accident on the interstate, rather than on these un-literary pages. Please, if you are looking for military adventure, it would be wiser to purchase a bag of green army men at the five & dime store than to waste your money on this book"
3,"Good story, but a little skimpy on the technical details.",I served aboard this boat from 71-74 as a reactor operator and enjoyed the author's account of life aboard the ship. The technical details could have been a little more explicit. Some of the Halibut's later missions made this one seem tame in comparison.
1,Dishonest - Not worth reading,"I felt cheated after I finished this book.The title implies that it describes top-secret missions in the pacific. In reality, it is the story about a sub crewman who did not know what was going on because he had no need to know."
1,"Should be renamed ""My little adventures on a submarine""","What a major disappointment. If it wasn't sold under the pretense the author would share information about covert sub recovery efforts, I might have enjoyed it. The photos (and story) are of the SS Halibut, a submarine famous at NAVSEA for being without a mission or purpose. It was an incredibly ""ugly"" sub, with a blister on the forward bow giving it the appeal of a woman with a goiter. The halibut was clearly a boat headed for the scrap heap long before her launch, and only after extensive investment was she later judged to be only a minor failure. The story of US Navy efforts to recover information/material from shipwrecked Soviet subs is fascinating. This book, however, is a dud in that respect and should be renamed with a less deceiving title. There are no secrets revealed in this book, and I found numerous factual errors. This is obviously a first novel for the author. Better luck next time."
1,Classified Lack of Details,"Viperfish -- really was the Submarine Halibut.(Source: _Spy Book:The Encyclopdia of Espionage_)Other details are revealed in the new book _Hostile Waters_.One wonders if the author of _Spy Sub_ and it's publisher simply left out these ""classified"" details to help sell the book as a ""Top Secret"" mission. Some secret.The book doesn't even BEGIN to talk about the mission's real core until chapter 12 -- the last.A total waste of time."
2,"Lots of pages, no story.","Details regarding the ""SPY SUB"" are as hard to find as themail buoy or sea bat that fellow bubbleheads will recall.Roger does provide an interesting view of daily life ona nuclear sub which may be entertaining to those with noexperience. As an old salt, I was waiting for the punchlineand never saw it. As Roger's editor, I would have advisedhim not to write the book at all - if you cannot tell thestory, then you have no story to tell. At best, it servesas little competition to the A&E television series onsubmarines. I thought it was a waste of my money.-Bill Kelly, USS Andrew Jackson, SSBN-619, 1973-1978."
1,"If this was a movie, I'd have gotten my money back","The actual text of this book begins on page 13, but by page 21 I had lost interest. After having read the poor reviews here, I knew going in that the book may be a bit lacking, but what killed it for me was the author's description of having gone to the library to find out what a ""viperfish"" was, and then describing the creature. Since we all know by now that the boat was in fact the Halibut, this obvious, unneeded lie in a 'secret mission' story (one that is no longer as much so) is certain to make any reader question whether or not what he or she is reading is distorted, hidden fact, or outright fiction.I would instead recommend a book such as Red Star Rogue. While that book itself is poorly edited, the story is fascinating."
1,Most boring submarine tale...,"I have read dozens of books about submarines and Spy Sub is undoubtably the most mundane, tedious and rambling sub story ever. The book is packed with the author's self congratulatory accounts of his love life and career but very thin about anything related to this subs mission. Spy Sub should be recalled and burned by the publisher"
1,This book is simply BORING,"Page after page of boring day to day operations of the nuclear reactor. Zero story about the cable tapping. Almost zero story about the retrieval of the Soviet boomer, and even then about all he said was ""I kept the reactor online while others searched for something secret."" Do not buy this book."
2,Life Of A Nuke On A Sub,"This book greatly exagerated what it was about. It appears to be a good description of life aboard a nuclear sub during the Vietnam war( I have never served, so I have no knowledge if it is accurate or not), but has next to nothing to do with the search and recovery of the Russian sub. The writer was on board the sub, but knew little to nothing of what went on. The book is about his life on board the sub, not about the mission."
3,Very difficult to clean!,"My food cooks wonderfully well on this grill, but it is SO difficult to clean! It definitely is not non-stick, and you will have to put some strength behind your scrubbing."
2,not so great...,"This is my first piece of Le Creuset, and i am not feeling inclined to add to it. I grilled chicken breasts on it, and while they came out just fine with lovely grill marks, cleaning it is very difficult."
5,One great grill...,"This is now by far my favorite le creuset item. It is a little hard to clean (make sure to season it well before using) but well worth it! It cooks vegetables beautifully, and is large enough to comfortably fit two LARGE chicken breasts. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes to grill, and you can pass this piece down to your grandchildren's grandchildren. It lasts forever!"
4,Cleaning Not So Fun,Everything most people have said is correct. It is a great grill and it does a good job however cleaning it is a different story.You need to soak it after you cook and trying to clean as much off as possible and then leave it alone.let it dry and the next day you'll be able to scrape almost everything off.
1,Book seems to have been fleshed out from an old diary,"While I'm sure Mike Krutko is a heck of a guy and would be wonderful to kno w in person, I'm afraid his book is not very exciting. The prose is flat and full of useless details, like the number and species of fish he caught from day to day. Although he led an adventurous life, you can't really get a feel for it from the way he's described it."
4,follow the coast,Following The Coast is about a trip Jim Arnosky and his wife took to the coast. They teach us all about the animals that live on the salt marshes. The book tells us facts about observing nature. It taught me that low tide is the best time to find birds in the salt marsh. When the water is low the birds are able to find food there better.What did you like or not like about the book?Following the Coast is a very informative book. This book will help children understand these creatures of the deep better. I enjoyed looking all the pictures the book had of all types of salt marsh creatures.Would you recommend this book? Why or Why not?We recommend this book to children ages 5-8. Kids are curious about life near the coast and ocean and this is great book for them to read to learn more about it. The book would be a great read aloud to science classes as well.
4,Earbud,Great product because it allows you to have both hands free while on your cell. It is also very easy to install.
4,Pretty good watch.,"The USB port on the side is a little hokey and will get dirty and scratched, but overall this is a great watch. It's easy to use and stores tons of information."
5,Timex datalink watch,I was looking for a watch to hookup to my computer so I could download items that I want to access to. The Timex filled that need I had. It is easy to use. Connects by a usb cable. Information is easily imputed and stored onto watch with easy access to it once on the watch.
4,I do like it. It does scratch.,"I just love data watches. This one has so many features...I can't even use them all. I do recommend this one.One thing to note, even though it says it has a mineral crystal face, it still scratches like a plastic face. This is the only drawback I can find and is something you should know before you make the purchase."
4,Great Watch,"I am buying this watch to replace the exact same watch that I have had for years. I have been very pleased with it. I wish Timex would have come out with a new model after all these years, but I guess it is not a priority. There is no comparable product when you look at ease of use, durability and features."
2,A War of Emotions,"Ever wonder what it would be like to be in the middle of a war? Rosemary Monica Stafford Leigh found out the hard way in Patricia Clapp's The Tamarack Tree. Her feelings caught in web of choices, Rosemary Leigh narrates the events, creating a gripping tale that exemplifies the hardships of a teenager during the civil war. This novel is great for young adults and teens who enjoy historical fiction. It delivers a powerful ride through life as a teen during a time of chaos. While giving lots of information to the reader, it brings the reader around twists and turns of the secondary plot. Including thrilling action sequences, heart-stopping suspence, and heart-throbbing romance, as well as historical background, this book could easily be the best novel of its time."
3,The Tamarack Tree Review,"I like the book the Tamarack Tree by Patrica Clapp because it is about thethe Civil War. So, if you like learning about the Civil War then this is a good book to read.The book the Tamarack Tree by Patricia Clapp has many characters like Rosemary, Derry, Mary Byrd and Amanda. It takes place in Mississippi in 1859 intill July 1863. The Tamarack Tree is a interesting book."
4,The Tamarack Tree,"At a young age actually growing up to be a young women, RoseMary Liegh was orphaned. ""I was thirteen when mama died, fourteen when Derick and I arrived at the states."" As RoseMary grows up she has been enjoying the social pleasures of her life but a little later on she has to make the courage to deal with the sound of cannonballs and gun shots and being scared all the time.Now, as she is eighteen she is going to have to make up the courage and will to survive, for herself for her lover and for her family!"
3,A War and Friends,Can you imagine how you would live through a war with out food and loud noises all the time when you just moved from London to the United States? Rosemary Monica Stafford Liegh got through the war with her wonderful friends and family. Rosemary had many incredible friends like Mary Byrd who hepled Rosemary settle in when she got to the states.
3,The Tamarack Tree,"Rosemary Leigh was an orphan at thirteen years of age. She was moved from England to Vicksburg, Mississippi in 1859. After four years she remembers her fear as cannonballs were shot, she writes about what she been going through to distract her from the war. There were many problems that Rosemary and her brother Derek were going through such as the beginning of the Civil War with no parents."
3,Can You Imagine?,"What would you do if you lived in a world with danger every minute? Along with a supply shortage of food, clothing, and anything necessary? When Rosemary lived in England with her mother she was as happy as can be. But after the tragic death of her mother, she and Derek, her brother, went to America. Derek , Rosemary and their friends in Vicksburg are near starvation during the war. Many people died or went poor. Clothing, food, and building supplies were scarce. After the war Derek marries Mary Byrd. Then Derek Mary, and Rosemary go to live in England in their old house. Rosemary and Derek live a hard life in Vicksburg, but it was a good one. It was full of danger, excitement, love, and fantasy. Can you Imagine the life they had ?"
3,The Tamarack Tree,"By:Chansy JonesWhat would you do if you were in the middle of a civil war and everything you needed was limited? If you really want to know what it would be like, then you should read the book, Tamarack Tree.Although it has little action it is full of decisions and opinions. Like everything there's a big problem, war!!! The civil war to be exact. Rosemary, the main character, has to live right through the siege of her new home, Vicksburg. Although she dislikes slavery, that is all her friends have ever known.If you like action packed stories this may not be the book for you. But if you want to know what it's like to truly want something, in Rosemary's case the end of war, then you may find this book interesting. Will Rosemary survive the conflicts of war? Read the book to find out."
1,The Tamarack Tree,"I thought that this book was very boring because nothing really happened. The plot is really trite, lots of people have used it before. They are in the middle of the Civil War, they are under siege and their supplies are running out. The main character, Rosemary, is very indecisive about which side she is on in this war. She loves her home in the South but she hates the idea of owning another person. Her brother, Derek, is a very different matter. He feels very strongly that the North is right and the South is wrong. There isn't a lot of suspense or foreshadowing. Also, you know how the book is going to end at the beginning. There is very little excitement in this book. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but a person who really likes history."
4,My opinion of this book,"This is a good book. It is easy to read. It gives you a perspective of a 16 year old girl who came from England. She isn't in the war, but the war is all over her town of Vicksburg. The Fighting can always be heard and sometimes bullets come really close."
5,This is a great video.,The 20 minute aerobic exercise portion of this tape is easy to follow and enjoyable to do. The 20 minute stretch routine is perfect for relaxing at the end of the day. I've had this tape for years and I love it.
4,"Aerobics for beginners, stretching for everyone","This video contains the best short stretching routine that I've found in exercise videos, and I've tried a number of them. There are better, longer stretching routines, but she gets your whole body stretched out really well in only 17 minutes. The aerobics part is very short...only 11 minutes aerobic and 21 minutes in duration. It's great for beginners and good for anyone to use before weight training or stretching to get you good and warmed up. I'm not a fan of progressive relaxation (where you tense your muscles to get them to relax). So, I never use the final segment of the tape. Overall, I'd say that the stretch routine alone is worth the price of the video."
2,Bad audio quality,"I can't get past the hideous audio quality here. I have owned and listened to CDs for years. This mastering is unbearable. Sounds worse than MP3. The musicians are great, but I can't say that I can enjoy this CD. The instruments sound muddled. It's as if someone copied this to CD from tape, then took out the hiss."
3,"Interesting, but ultimately dissappointing","Like all C's work, this book is stimulating and easy to read, in parts inspiring, in parts depressing. C says that no one can be Creative with a capital C, unless he masters all that went before him in his field. Accordingly, children, no matter how original, cannot, by definition be creative. A paradoxical and, I guess, creative observation.. C is especially intriguing when he discusses creativity as the result of interaction between the individual, the field, and the domain. Creativity is not a private enterprise but occurs only when an individual, who has mastered his subject matter is acknowleged by the gatekeepers of his field of endeavor or if, like Freud or the Wright brothers, creates his own field. The social aspect of creativity is nowhere better discussed. Unfortunately, C articulates no clear thesis, and with the exception of long quotes from notably creative people, the last third of his book degenerates into platitude and truism"
3,Not as good as his other books,"By and large, the book is OK, but it doesn't have the same impact as his other books. There are also some things that I strongly disagree with, namely his definition of ""creativity.""Real ""creativity"" happens when the work is ultimately appreciated by society. To me creativity is anything that is the antithesis of the ""consume and destroy"" philosophy. Rather, creativity is ""creation and conservation."""
2,Presumptuous,"Creativity is a very broad concept and bears on equally broad, elusive and poorly understood fields such as spirituality, philosophy and religion, and as such should be approached with humbleness. The author tries to over-rationalize something that, like faith, love and poetry, cannot be grasped by the scientific method. Trying to squeeze that very thing that makes us humans into rigid, objective, artificial, methodological scientific research reduces it to a parody of itself. In the end, the author equates creativity with worldly success. He stands within one inch from concluding that creativity is The Art of The Deal. Nothing is said of the creative process itself, and only a very UNcreative person could have written such book.Very disappointing."
5,My favorite book,"If you are interested in how to motivate a person to become more creative, this book is an excelent option !The author has a great expertise in this issue. The book estimulates new ideas ... In fact, this is my favorite about about creativity. It's an amazing experience ! I do recommend for all people interested in learning and education."
2,an odd definition of creativuty,"This book narrowly defines Creative people as those who have made a name for themselves by ""changing their domain"". While it is interesting to read about some of the world's most Ambitious and Recognized creatives, it thereby instantly excludes all the people who are true artists in their craft, but simply have not been recognized publicly by society or become famous in their chosen fields. A frustrating and exclusionary take - much too narrow for me."
3,I don't really get it.,"I had this book, or one like it, a long time ago and got a lot of inspiration from it. It is a difficult read."
4,"New, revised edition in the works","Don't pay a ridiculous collectors price. A corrected, new and better edition is in the works, and the profit will go the the author/publisher."
2,Phone Home?,"This book offers some good ideas for some different adventures in the San Rafael Swell but is somewhat confusing and deceiving. In some of his hike descriptions, Steve uses time instead of distance to detail his routes e.g. hike 19 minutes southeast to the wash, then turn east. This can be misleading because everybody hikes at different paces. If you hike especially fast or slow you may make a turn at the wrong landmark. He also described a route as turning at the E.T. looking rock. - Huh? We missed our landmark and had to phone home. His maps (though meant to be supplements for topo maps) look deceivingly one-dimensional, which give a false sense of easy, flat walking. If you're experienced in the backcountry, it's a good list of routes. I would, however, recommend Kelsey's San Rafael book for better maps, landmark descriptions, and distances though you do have to adjust his hike times as he hikes much faster than most. Add time and a half as a general rule."
2,dangerously wrong info,"We used Allen's books many times. The information is wrong way too often regarding exit and entrance points in canyons. It seems that nobody reviews guidebooks before publishing. The worst trio we discovered so far are: Steve Allen, Michael Kelsey and Vivian Lougheed. Hiker beware!"
2,Nonstick coating peels off,"Although Le Creuset replaced my original pan, the problem persists.....the non-stick coating peels off! This is one of the best pans I have ever owned besides the little coating issue! I followed all recommendations regarding heat source, cleaning, utensil type used, etc. & the coating still peeled off. If you are going to spend the money for Le Creuset products, skip the ones that have a non-stick coating & 'stick' with the traditional products."
5,expensive but worth every bit,"It took me time to decide for Le Creuset, especially for the price, but now I am using it every day, so easy to clean and so neat to use from the top of the stove to the oven."
2,Mats were stiff and did not live up to cost. Took away from car's interior feel,"Not what I expected especially for over $100. The mats that came fit my car except on the edges, there was a slight gap and over the next two weeks that gap got bigger - did not look good. I assume it is because they are plastic and stiff and there is nothing to hold them to the sides, think truck liner material. We went to the beach and the mats got sand/pebbles on them - they scraped and appeared years old instead of 2 weeks. The color of the mats did not match my interior (tan) and since the mats are very large going up on the sides of the floor, a lot of the carpet was covered making my car look like it had a lot of plastics in it. Finally, they do not hide the dirt instead it sits on top of the plastic mat. Recommend only if you have a truck or a car with a black interior and need them just for the winter."
5,Great mats,Great mats. Protects carpet and fits. Holes do not line up with holes for anchoring the carpet mats. There are small gaps between mats and carpet though.
2,weather Tech FloorMat Honda odyessy 07,"2007 Honda odyessy weather tech mat floorI used this floor mat about 2 monthspro - Perfect fitcon - hard to clean and can not use any cleaner product such as windex or anything else. It is painful....so on top of cleaning my car, this floor mat created more work for me...ugh...close to paying around $230..not worth it...conclusion: I bought the tan color so I recommend get the darker color so you will spend less time to clean. I would like to refund and get the darker one, but i don't think weathertech would not allow me to that."
1,They sent the wrong item!,I requested Weather Tech front floor liners for my 2005 Boxster. When they arrived I found out that the drivers side fit but the passengers side did not. The labeling on the box said that it was for a Toyota Prius. The passengers side was not even close. I checked and double checked the amazon website to make sure that I had ordered properly. They were wrong!
1,What an awful book~,"I checked this book out of our local library without fully reading it through. I had to skip over big sections of it when I read it to my son that night. The young boy in the book eventually accepts and loves his new sister, but in the meantime, he hits her, steps on her and wishes for a rope so he can hang her outside so he can't hear her cry. We returned it the next day and showed it to our librarian, who removed it from the shelves. There are much better books out there about being a big brother or sister."
4,"I'm New TO CB, and this was a good intro !!","I'll admit, I first heard Clifford Brown's name at a Rick Braun concert a few years back. Based on that mention, I purchased several different CB projects. Although I have listened to another one, this is my first review of his recordings. I also have read the other reviews. Briefly, this CD has more ""laid back"" tracks than other CB work. Although every track is not that way, it appears to me to be restrained. Other reviewers have the historical notes. My research indicates they are correct. Essentially, later CB projects became edgier and ""hard bop."" Like most music, your mood dictates what you want to listen too. This project is for that soft or smooth side. Enjoy!!!"
4,Stronger than dirt,"They're vacuum bags, and they work fine in my vacuum cleaner. The service was fine. I don't know what else to say..."
3,Just what I ordered,"After ordering, the product came quickly and was as described on the Amazon website. Bit too much packaging though. Not sure it was all necessary."
3,Eureka Style RR bags,"I got these bags quickly from amazon.com and I thought they were paper thin, or thinner than the 3M bags I normally used from target. Ran out of those and tried these. I think they did okay, but the 3M bags were clearly better as it was thicker and heavier than these bags. I did like the flap on the top to enclose the dust/dirt in the bag, which I don't think helped much because the dust still comes out as you try to take off the backing and enclose the bag. I think the 3M bags smelled better after the bags were full, not that they smelled nice, but these bags did smell worse. I haven't tired the Eureka bag because I haven't been able to find any since I bought the vacuum."
4,Very great cheap bags,I buy these because I can get a better deal on Amazon than buying them at a store near me. I can see no difference from Eureka brand and they work very well in my vacuume. I recommend you try them.
2,Very Disappointing,"Overall I find this album disappointing. Many of the songs are boring and sound alike. Coalmine, A Real Fine Place, and Tell Me are the only standouts. I can listen to these over and over again and not get tired of them. Bible Song and Missing Missouri are also good but a notch or two below the previous named songs. I prefer Born To Fly and Restless to this cd."
3,Few Tunes are too Bland,"Hey, I purchased this Sara Evans CD strictly for the song ""Coalmine"". I love it.. the song is awesome, and definetely worth the CD in itself.The rest.. bland. Her singles are ok. ""real fine place to start"" ""Cheatin""(one of my least fav singles) ""you'll always be my baby"".. but they are still nothing I would buy. Mostly, I put Coalmine on repeat. I can't get enough of that song.The song by Lori McKenna (Bible Songs) is fairly good, and ""Mama's night out"" is another stand-out. ""Tell me"" is good. But the other ones.. Bland!I could do without this CD if I could find some other way to listen to Coalmine. But I don't regret purchasing this CD due to how much I love Coalmine. And the ones I do like on the CD I enjoy.. but overall, it is a bland CD. Sara is ok.. her voice doesn't do much for me, but it is certainly not the worst.Do I recommend the CD? No. I recommend listening to the 30 sec clips first, then make your decision."
3,"Sara is good,but Dolly is great!!","after buying both of these ladies cds, Ihave to say that Sara's album is a good album. She is startin to go back to the coutry sound that we all loved before she went to a morepop sound! some great songs include ""coalmine"" and ""these four walls"". the best track on the cd is""Tell me"" but the rest of the album falls flat and is easy to forget about! Now on the other hand Dollys new album ""Those were the days"" is a great album and dolly has continued the blugrass sound that we have come to love! best cuts are ""where have the flowers gone"", ""crimson and clover"" and ""blowin in the wind"". two great cds,from two great ladies! I would urge any one to buy both , but if you could chose one, ""those were the days"" is a stronger cd!"
5,Extremely honest,"Joan Rivers did a fabulous job with this. She was extremely honest in her descriptions with show business and describes the ""business"" of it so openly. Her vulnerability and strength are intertwined so vividly.She is funny,honest,intelligent,good-hearted and insecure as most, but brave enough to admit it. I would highly recommend the audiotape and book as well. It is a great tool for anyone dealing with the emotional aspects of show business rejections. Joan Rivers proves that not only has she been a survivor thru tremendous hardships,but that she is indeed a fragile,yet strong human being. The audio makes for great listening for days stuck in traffic jams."
5,"great ""mommy"" watch","This is the 2nd watch I've had like this. I wore my other for over 4 years before the battery ran out (I just replaced the band a couple times because it just kept right on working). I love the fact that it has 3 alarms (you can set to go off daily, weekdays, or weekends) because as a mommy sometimes I get so busy that I need a reminder. I didn't like the little compass on this model, but I just cut the little band off (it's not functional to keeping the watch band on)."
1,Worst RTL example I have ever seen,"The CPU example uses some of the worst design techniques I have ever seen. Several examples of things are shown that should not be used in RTL design work. For example it uses multiple clock lines and has this great ""reg"" block with a locally generated clock line. To make the design simulate correctly the author adds (after 1 ns) to all assignments. Why, because he does not understand concurrent processing and VHDL. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IT IS A TOTAL WAIST OF MONEY!"
3,"too many bugs/typos, but explains basic ideas","Perry's 4th edition seems a little hastily put out on the market. Many inconsistencies between the text and the contents of the enclosed CD. But if you are willing to tolerate this, then the book is actually ok. It teaches VHDL with many examples of source code. You should be able to ascertain that VHDL is a pretty simple language. From a theoretical computing viewpoint, there is nothing too abstruse in VHDL.What you do have to be careful about is if you actually want to use the example code that's either in the text or on the CD. Here, you should go carefully through it, because of possible bugs. Which does afford the advantage that it forces you to understand the code. An inadvertant pedagogic property of the book!"
3,OK for a starter but you will need more references,"This was my first VHDL book. VHDL is hard learn and Perry managed to get me through to my first model. However, this book has a lot of problems as a reference work. As a tutorial, it is OK, but there are often concepts that are used but never defined. For example, nowhere in the book is there a list of primitive operators for VHDL! Still, what he does explain well is what each individual language concept is use for. That is what makes it for this book."
2,Confusing and not well written,"This seemed to be THE VHDL book, I always found in bookstores. So I bought it. I know other people seem to like the book, but I found it confusing, whenever something important (like the instantiation of flip-flops) comes up. loads of extra confusing detail is thrown in. It really confused me. I just needed the basics first and once I got the hang of that, then I needed more details. With this book, it all comes in one lump. Also, it may be because it is a 3rd edition, but its not very well structured, I had to leap about the book a lot and the extra material didn't seem to link in well with the other stuff."
2,Not in original package,"When the package arrived, it had obviously been placed in a box that had already been used. I won't be ordering this item again."
2,a massive disappointment,"this box-set is reasonably cheap but even its low cost has not been a consolation for my disappointment. Given my tastes, this is ""cold"" Schubert. To me the worst experience has come with the ""Unfinished"" symphony. One of the most tragic statement in music history is transformed in a lifeless, boring, scholastic exercise.Please give me back Furtwangler, Klemperer and Bruno Walter!!!"
1,SassyBax Booty Boosting Legging,"Sorry, but this product does not do the job. I returned them. They don't boost the bootie. They are soft and nice to the feel, I just think they need to double up on their fabric in the bootie department in order to get the job done."
4,Thick and snug,"These tights are a nice, thick, opaque material. They are very snug, especially in the midsection. The first few days I wore them, they were a bit uncomfortable because of how tight they are, but I have gotten used to them. The top comes all the way up to my natural waist, so it sucks everything in. I love how they shape my thighs, inner and outer. I am 5'5"" and 125 lbs, and the medium is definitely snug on me, but the large would probably be not snug enough, so the medium was the right choice. Overall, a long-lasting pair of tights in a shaping material that is super versatile."
4,"great fabric, but need longer lengths & opaque seat","Pro: This is an awesome fabric: light, soft, a lot of compression. Love the simplicity, just a nice weight opaque footless compression tight, with a waist-high waist. No ruching, or foldover, or lo-rise or zippers, etc. Con: Not completely opaque in the seat. Weird. Even with a long top - I don't think so. Also, the style is really more ""shapewear,"" and thus more like 7/8 length instead of full length. On top of that, I'm 5'10"" and these were 5-6 inches short of where I'd want them to be lengthwise. Sassybax, you are on to something. Offer this in a full length, better yet in a full length with tall option, add some larger sizes, and make the seat opaque. Then call me because I'll buy at least 5."
4,What's in the stew?,"Nancy Pickard's THE SECRET INGREDIENT MURDERS is the last of her efforts to continue the exploits of a character created by the late Virginia Rich. The story has complex story lines that are loosely woven together, but I found the mother's actions and concerns for her children who turned 18 during the story to be excessive. The idea of threatening a son with military school when he will be entering college doesn't fly, maybe if the son was 14 this story line might have worked.Other than the above the plot is tight and the conclusion is satisfying.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHER."
1,What happened to the real Nancy Pickard?,"Secret Ingredient Murders reads more like an amateurish first novel than the product of a fine writer like Nancy Pickard. Even the author seems to be bored with the plot as she experiments with potential motives and villains. Pickard did a fine job of completing work that Virginia Rich left unfinished on her death, but Pickard is far better suited to the delightful social activist Jenny Cain than to the ""Murder She Wrote"" cozy style of Eugenia Potter.Skip this book and hope the real Nancy Pickard reemerges soon, perhaps with Jenny Cain in tow!"
1,If you can make it past the first few chapters,You might enjoy the book. The first chapter was so full of similes that it almost made me sick - as if this was the writing element being practiced at the moment. And yet I continued on - tortured - just to discover who did it.
3,Tracks missing from copy I bought...,"This review is not really about the music as much as this particular recording. When trying to put this on my Zune, I found that this CD has only the first 15 tracks, while on the CD documentation itself, over 20-21 or more tracks are listed. So there appears to be a manufacturing error, at least with the copy I purchased. So, if you plan to purchase this particular recording, ask the seller how many tracks are actually on the CD itself. Be sure the seller doesn't just read off the printed listing to answer this question. I viewed the CD tracks also in Windows Media Player, just in case there was a display problem with the Zune software, but it also only listed the first 15 tracks."
3,Adagio too fast for my taste,"Yes, I agree with the Reviewer that in this work if one disagree with the slow movement tempo/interpretation, then it will not satisfy. I find the tempo here too fleeting. I suggest the Melos/Rostropovich."
4,Acceptable,The headset works very nicely and I can hear very well with it which is a surprise considering I have a small percentage of hearing loss. It doesn't get 5 stars from me because it just doesn't fit in or on my ear comfortable. I expected a better fit or more adjustments from it. Then again it could just be that I have an odd shaped ear.
1,Vintage Garbage - Modern Marketing,"This DVD set is just plain awful.Obscure, bottom-of-the-sewer episodes replete with authentic 1950s television broadcast quality.Avoid this purchase like the plague."
5,Lush sound of Henry Mancini,"Another of my favorite albums from my youth. This particular recording I consider lush and romantic. The same goes for his album, Six Hours Past Sunset. You could always count on Henry Mancini to produce some great easy listening music."
5,Demstifying TCP/IP,"As a librarian I am always looking for books that get to the heart of the information and can give the reader implicit information. Camp delivers. As a student in a VOIP course, the book filled in the missing information that was not understood by the professor. I recommend this book as a place to start. Camp explains how the OSI model layers are affected by the implementation of VOIP. Additionally, having had a network course I still did not understood the function of the DNS and the DHCP which are very important to the precise functioning of a network. Camp explains without missing a beat. And Camp erodes the confusion about VOIP being IP telephony. You get more than you bargain for when you read this book."
3,Didn't Deliver on Price and Promises,Less than half of the book had any real information. The balance was fluff and contained no specifics or facts. I got the feeling the goal of this book was to get something out fast and make sure it was 200 or more pages.
2,Not a practical book,"The book is sold as a: ""Practical book that provides students and managers with all the tools needed to implement and manage these changes.""Unfortunately this is not the reality. This is a book written by an academic and is of no or limited use for conducting change processes in practice. The major idea in the book is that change can be carried out by filling out forms and going through checklists.The author gives many references and discusses theories of change management. Parts of the book may be regarded as a collection of ideas from the academic world and could therefore be of interest for academics."
5,Fun!,"This is a fun book. A lot of pictures and a not so serious attitude. (...) It has a lot more of the cadet perspective than most of the other books and even pokes fun here and there. (...) it clearly says that all royalties are going to West Point's alumni association. I will agree if you want a text-heavy history of West Point this is not it, or a long-winded treatise on West Point's philosophy, but this is a great gift or souvenir book, and there's nothing wrong with that during West Point's Bicentennial celebration. I liked it a lot."
4,Out Door Watch,"Nice watch if you are hiking, biking, in the outdoors, its a comfortable watch to wear, in fact I have it on today!"
4,Fits fine,"Not worth 5 stars as it isn't quite 100% the same as the original, but to actually see any difference you would have to really look closely at the two. and nobody does that. It took all of about 2 minutes to install, lit up perfectly fine, has its own bulbs, and is waaaaay cheaper than going to autozone and getting the part for $100, which probably would have been this exact same piece, only in some nice packaging that i would have had to use a knife to cut thru. I'm happy with it."
3,Police Finder,"This radar detector is ok, it pick up the signals from police running radar. The only thing I dont like is the false signal from grocery stores,other radar dectector,burg.alarms ect.The X , K , KA , Bands features is good on it. I had to turn the X and K band off because of the false signals. Most police are running KA band anyway."
2,More boring than I could imagine,"I loved one of the songs he did in a movie I saw so bought the CD. It is one long, boring cd. I cannot recommend it to anyone."
1,Average,"Joshua Radin is not my cup of tea, I found him to posses mediocre song writing abilities with predictable melodies. I'm sure he has a following out there but his music is not for me."
2,boring,"I bought this based on the reviews and audio clips. However, the more you listen to it, the more annoying his voice gets. By the end of the cd, his ""breathy, whispery"" sound is just too much."
2,it is nice but nothing special,"Its nice mellow stuff. No way should Elliot Smith, Paul Simon, James Taylor, or Cat Stevens be mentioned in comparison. It is vapidly sincere like Zack Braff's voice over in the last five minutes of a scrubs episode. So if you are here becuase you like Scrubs, check out Colin Hay. Have a nice day."
4,Soft and beautiful,"This CD is great for cold october mornings while getting ready for the day, sipping a coffe and window-gazing. The lyrical content is unique and well delivered and I found the instrumentation to be moving.Anyone who likes REALLY soft music and isn't bored by an album that tends to flow between tracks almost like one long song should pick this one up! You'll be glad you did."
5,LOVE this!,This has become my absolute favorite CD. His voice is so soothing and amazing. I never get tired of it.
5,Closer,"Pity, that I can only give it 5 stars, it deserves another 2 stars. This artist was used as background to give perfect poignance to two Scrubs episodes. ""Closer"" when I heard it on the 4th season episode ""My best laid plans"" was so moving, so appropriate, and sounded so good, that I just became obsessed with hearing it again. Oddly, I am not a music afficianado, and prefer instrumental over vocal. However this song and this artist trumps all other music preferences"
1,Very Mellow,"Too mellow, for my taste, but the talent and quality is there. I just don't see myself listening to this artist."
1,"confusing, and no purpose","i ordered this toy for my little boy recommended by many blogs and reviews, but when i opened it up there was no pamphlet instructions to help build it. Was a little frustrating for my three yr old to make anything, and the ladders don't stay together. wish i would have spent my money on something more useful."
5,Wonderful toy,"This is simple yet ingenious toy. The ladders can lock in amazing ways and create very complex shape. Anyone, including adults, interested in construction toys, will find it a very fun toy. You can literally spend hours on this toy, just imagining and making shapes and structures. The pieces are big enough that even small kids can play with them. I'd personally say this is more of a 4+ years toy than a 3+ toy as advertised.The only flip side is that the plastic of the toy, though good, could be better."
3,Not as easy as discribed as easy piano.,The book stated easy piano but my daughter is in her first year of piano and it is at a higher standard than her present playing ability.
4,Good Collection,"Believe it or not, I was looking for the 45 version of ""Gimme Some,"" which is included in this solid collection. Great service by the seller."
4,"Speaker could be better, but it's okay","The charger works fine, but the sound quality on the the speaker could be a little better. I found the ""fade-out"" (loss of sound at beginning of conversation) excessive, but nothing that would keep me from buying another one. It's okay."
1,Too Tame to Tittilate,"Having met and known a number of porn stars during the years that I lived in Washington, DC, I've come to expect that they can be funny, insightful, or at least have an interesting point of view on life's practicalities.I was expecting some degree of this wit or practical wisdom from this book, but I was terribly disappointed. Further, I think anyone who's read the clever interviews by Jamoo in ""Freshmen"" magazine will find these snippets really lacking.If you're looking for something that's both clever and interesting about the porn industry, I'd recommend the video ""Shooting Porn,"" which has far hotter images and far more interesting comments from the participants."
1,"Great Title, Crappy Book","I'm not saying that porn stars are the most intelligent people in the world, but the quotes are STUPID! I'm sure porn stars have more going on up there than what they're made out to be in the book. The stories are boring. It's like the author was sitting a restaurant near a porn star's table, and overheard only part of what the porn star saying to his friends and tried to write a book about it. The pictures area all in black and white, and there are only a few pictures of any stars of any interest. Most of the stars are ""bear types."" Not that that's bad, but if you're not into bears.... All and all, this book is a coffee table book, that should be better kept under the coffee table's short leg to keep the table and your coffee cup from tipping over."
1,"Jerky Quotes, Infantile Interviews, and Useless Trivia",The most desirable men on earth have been interviewed by some brainless author. These well recognized and respectable actors of porn must have been paid top bucks to be interviewed by some prebuscent interviewer...that's fine...but the results are an insult to any intelligence!
5,The most entertaining and thought provoking humor book out.,"I re-read this book today as I was just sitting around and watching the rain fall. Not only did I get ""excited"", but I laughed and sighed with pleasure all at the same time.Can't wait for the sequel or ANY other new books written by this remarkable author extraordinaire !"
5,Quality item at a great price,"I ordered this to hold a 40"" LCD for the corner of our bedroom. The product quality was top notch and the Amazon price was fantastic."
2,Vantage point AX2ACL01 mount,"2 Stars because it did not my fit my 42"" TV and the description says up to 42"" I got a Vizio in case this makes a difference. This only fits 1 hole mount pattern so make sure your TVs holes are only an 8"" x 8"" pattern. As for as build quality and features I really DO wish it would have fit because it looked great mounted where I wanted it. Tey need to re do their description or add another mounting bracket with the TV to fit different Vesa patterns"
5,Miss this show.,"This show had me hooked when it was shown in the UK beginning with 1987 episodes. I had heard that the show was at it's best in the first few years. Now we can find out, this pilot movie is fantastic, it has everything you could want in a soap and more. Fine acting from Lloyd Bridges, Wesley Addy, Lauren Marie Taylor (sadly not in this pilot)Susan Walters and many more."
5,A winter must!,"While the weather outside is frightful, warm feet are so delightful, and to work I have to go, so let is snow, let it snow, let it snow!These socks rock!!!! Just remember not to put them in the dryer!"
1,Tripe,"Spell check would have helped with the flow... aside from even just that trivial stuff the whole book is just one constant stream of 'yeah, thought that was gonna happen' or 'where did they come up with that? That makes no sense'. The constantly changing point of view and story telling means absolutly nothing even at the end of the book. Joe Blow A goes to visit the future in-laws... great...where does this fit in with the story? Oh yeah, it doesn't at all. You killed 3 trees to waste 6 pages and 2 minutes of my time... and that's only one of many instances of things like that. Notice that people are selling this thing used for $0.72... that should be a good clue for you..."
3,Decidely unremarkable,"Not much to say about this book. Jay Gridley is front and center, but everyone else seems to be just thrown in as filler for a mundane plot. Definitely not the strongest of the series and probably is the weakest. This book isn't bad, it just isn't good."
1,The Archimedes Effect,The only pleasure I got from this was watching it catch fire and burn in my fireplace. What a crock of crap.
3,Lack Quality for Convenience,The earbud provides convienent hands-free phone operation. This is a great safety feature while driving. The earbud/microphone has a sound delay and is less clear than phone use without the adapter.
5,The idiosyncratic gaze!,"Samson Francois' Chopin has overtly overtopped and even redefined the whole concept around Chopin's universe.As a matter of fact, Alfred Cortot, Dinu Lipatti, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli brought not only a refreshing vision but still better, new perspectives of interpretation, leaving behind the romanticism and approaching him under the idiosyncratic emblem of a bygone era. That's what the previous reviewers have denominated eccentric rather than interpretative renovation, where the dimension of every piece is considered in its own individuality and specific weight, where the concept of miniaturist composer has been substituted by the thinker poet, earning an organic quality and major dramatic scope.I cannot think about another pianist who may phrase Chopin as Francois did it. So, please do me a favor and firmly decide to acquire it. You will surprise yourself!"
2,No thank you,"I read her first two books in this series and could not put them down. Both Braden and Rowena's stories were excellent. They were very intense. Quentin's story I found to be very hard to get into and stay into. When I choose cleaning or tv over a book I know I don't like the book. I wish I could have gotten out of it what the other reviewers did, but I had no desire to even finish the book. I have read all of Susan Krinard's books and this is the only one I found that I didn't like."
1,So Disappointed!,"I have been a fan of Ms. Krinard since I read Prince of Wolves and Prince of Dreams. I was sorely disappointed by this latest effort. Her strong characters, romance and sexual tension---well they seem to be missing in action. Oops, the action was missing, too!This book was booring. Too many characters and too much effort(and it did seem to be an effort on Ms. Krinard's part) was taken with the mental illness explanations. A third of the way through the book, I totally lost interest. It really was a chore to read.I sincerely hope that Susan Krinard's next novel will revisit the intense characterization and depth of her previous works. Fantasy and Historical Romance doesn't make a good platform to campaign on mental health issues."
2,Plodding & unromantic,"After enjoying Ms. Krinard's previous two books in this series, I was looking forward to Quentin's story. It was a big disappointment and took me forever to read. Quentin almost seems like a different person from the previous books. While Johanna is a strong woman, there is almost no chemistry between them. This book is much more a study in mental illness than a romance. If you can read it for that, it's somewhat enjoyable. The action really didn't get going until 3/4 of the way through the book. The happy ending is very abrupt; it reads as though Rowena is there, but she isn't. There's very little werewolf in it either.There'll be a delay (at least) before I try another in this series...it was that dull."
3,"It Was OK, But Had Flaws","I was really looking forward to this book; I've read all the others in the ""Wolf"" series.The book didn't hold my interest very well. I'm not sure if it was the plot (a drunk who's really a split personality, who happens to also be a werewolf, and both personalities fall in love with the doctor who can cure them; plus all the other residents of the Haven), or if the writing just didn't work for me this time.Plus, the whole climax was a bit too much. All of a sudden, our hero, in the middle of a fight for his life, just merges with the other personality and wins the day, and then is completely OK with himself and who he is. There's no continued mental problems or therapy here. He's just OK.All in all, the book was OK, but not good enough to keep me from thinking about the flaws."
1,One weird romance...,"... well if you call the heroine-doctor falling in love with her multiple-persona (due to torture as a child by a relative), werewolf patient a romance. This isn't a romanticized Jekyll/Hyde with fur type of story. I kept reading it wondering where the story was going and how she could give us our happy romantic ending. It does, but it's still a weird read.If you like your romantic couple to suffer before ending up together then this might be the book for you. I found it tedious.Ms. Krinards descriptons and scenery are very good, but her jumping from each character's point of view (sometimes within the same paragraph) got confusing.There are many other books of supernatural romance out there... I would strongly suggest you read one of those."
5,High quality and value,"Having had experience with other Fiskars outdoor tools, I purchased this and have used it about 2 months splitting small amounts of green hickory for my smoker. The handle is quite comfortable, the edge is sharp and hard, the tool is well balanced. I'd buy another."
2,Not very durable,"I purchased this item as a gift for a person who does a lot of camping. It loked like and rugged. I have a full size Fiskars Ax and have been pleased with it. The 14"" hatchet I purchased broke on the first day. It actualy broke on the first piece of kindling he was splitting and went flying across the campsite. The handle just cracked. Granted it was cold out. Maybe 20deg.F but that's when you need to chop kindling and firewood....when it's cold.I sent it back to Amazon today and bought a steel handled hatchet. That won't break I'm sure."
5,"GREAT hatchet, super sharp bargain","I haven't had a hatchet since childhood camping days. Recently, I began to experiment with building rocket stoves. It was tedious to collect dry kindling. I got the idea of burning cutoffs from construction but then was faced with unwieldy flat lumber which was hard to ignite. If I used wadded paper, it made smoke and left a cleaning mess. This hatchet was the answer. It is SHARP and can easily slice off slivers of 2x lumber without any problem at all. The slices are so clean, it looks as if you used a knife. It's lightweight too, so you can make quite a lot of kindling out of a bit of 2x4 at one time. I accidentally left it out in rain overnight and it's as good as new. Unlike my previous hatchet, this one seems able to take care of itself. I would buy it again in a heartbeat. Anyone who needs to make kindling without wearing themselves out should buy this Fiskars hatchet. It's small, tough, easy to use and SHARP."
4,Best i've owned.,"I have owned and used a couple hatchets, this one surpasses them all. It is nice and light for putting in my hiking backpack, but the head is heavy enough to allow powerful strokes. The design of the head really makes it easy to swing through the wood I have cut, and comes out of logs which it didn't go through easily. The handle was a little bit slippery when wet, compared to a wood handle hatchet, which Is why I gave it a 4 star. Better still than the coleman type rubber handle."
3,an axe to grind,"bought two of these for gifts. when i got them , i got two different models. it was too late to send one back. please pay attention next time"
2,"tiny axe, dont buy","the head on this axe is so stupidly tiny its a JOKE. This would be an appropriate axe for a 2 ftmidget. If you want to make kindling, forget it. You want a head that is twice as big as this."
5,camp ax,"a very well made item, just the right size for around the campsite, perfect for pounding in stakes, and a perfect size for kindling"
5,Great hatchet,"I purchased theFiskars 7884 X27 36-Inch Super Splitting Axe, and was very impressed with it, so I thought I would give the hatchet a try. It is great, the blade is heavier than other blades, which helps build up the momentum and splits the wood nicely. I like the plastic handle because it feels a little more durable than a wood handle."
5,Great Little firewood helper,"This is a great addition to the firewood tools, when splitting Elm on a hyd log splitter it gets Very Stringy, this little ax is sooo sharp it cuts the tangled stringy wood with no problem.."
2,Dull,"Everyone seems to think this is sharp, but mine won't cut warm butter. My worn out 30 year old hatchet will cut better than this. Maybe I got a bad one. I will use it for a hammer. I ordered a Estwing after I received this joke. Now THAT'S a real hatchet. It cuts like crazy and is American made to boot."
2,nice axe but handle doesn't hold up,"This hatchet seems well designed and I loved the blade protector/carrier.But the hollow ""polymer"" handle transmits vibration to your hand pretty severely. I think I had read about some models having a hollow shaft, but didn't realize that THIS model was hollow.Then, on my third or fourth use, the handle shattered when I was splitting fairly ordinary kindling. Admittedly I was using a hammer to 'persuade' the blade down through the wood, but it seems to me that a hatchet SHOULD be able to handle that kind of usage.Next time I will stick with a steel handle, and perhaps something a tad longer than this 14"" size."
3,An OK Hatchet,I agree with the reviewer who was disappointed that this product from the reputable Fiskars company is now being stamped out in China. But it does what it's supposed to do and it seems pretty darn rugged.
3,"Good hatchet, lousy sheath","The X7 is a 5 star hatchet that comes with a 2 star sheath. The hatchet has a nice swing and balance; the edge comes sharp and the anvil is adequate for pounding. The sheath is passable if you have no need to attach it to a tool belt. But if you want to carry the X7 in the field, you'll have to buy a better sheath."
5,More than 5 stars!!!!!!!!!!!,"This. Is. Amazing. It was very sharp out of the box, and continued to be so throught the long line of 7-inch thick mini-logs that I chopped through. On the other side of the spectrum, it is sharp enough to slash twigs like a machete! Works very well splitting kindling, as well. The handle is very ergonomic, and my hands did not get tired from holding it.The sheath is nice, as well. (It does look like retail packaging, that's what I thought at first, but then I realized it would cut through a fabric one!)This is amazing!!!"
3,"Good handle, not so good head/steel","I bought this axe after watching the Fiskars axes being run over with a giant truck and not breaking. Fiskars axes being made in Finland so they seem like good quality. I've been using this axe to split a lot of wood. It does a decent job on softer wood like pine. It doesn't do so well on the harder woods. This is due to the edge being too soft. It rolls very easily. Now, I'm not a metalurgist but I can tell you that either the steel used in these axes is very low quality or they just harden it very soft (53-54RC)so edges won't chip. I think it's both. In contrast, a high quality, axe type steel can be very though yet at the same time can have a thin edge to chop well. This isn't the case here. I do like the fiberglass handle that's why I still use this axe. The handle is very light so most of the weight is on the head. In summary: Good hande, not so good head/steel."
3,"Ok, but not for splitting hardwood","I agree with most that this is a decent hatchet, light handle and the blade could be harder. It certainly doesn't have the heft or leverage to really split hardwood though. It is handy if you need to notch wood, or cut small limbs off a tree, but keep it away from anything that can dull the blade."
2,Wouldn't reccommend,I purchased this hatchet at my local Lowe's two weeks ago. I used it primarily to make kindling from larger seasond firewood. It worked very well until last night when the handle shattered just below the head. I sent an e-mail to Fiskars and am now waiting for their response.
4,Great product,"Work great, Best gift I every bought for he. He chopped all his wood it to little pieces. I'm thinking of buying the next size up."
4,Good stuff,Does the job and takes a beating. Just keep in mind that it is a lot smaller than some standard sized hatchets (blade profile especially). It would be even better for camp if it came with a sheath of any sort other than the cheap plastic housing it hangs on a shelf in.
4,Great little chopper,This item is a high quality item and is perfect for camping or back pack trips. It is light wieght but delivers when put to use.
5,Best hatchet I've ever had,"Super sharp, good heft and easy to resharpen again and again. This hatchet is Definitely worth the price in my opinion."
5,Awesome,I have an Eastwing 16 inch and its just to big to be hiking with throughout the woods. I use this to clear our spots for hunting when I'm on the ground or in my climbing tree stand. I found that is exactly the same as the Gerber series but cheaper. I would definitely recommend this for someones else.
5,excellent hatchet for small to big jobs,"This hatchet is designed for small jobbs, but I think it is quit good for chopping thicker trees too. It is very sharp and the other side can be used as a hammer. This tool is what I was looking for!"
5,Quality product,"Quality product, dependable and prompt shipping. Liked it so well, we bought 4 more!"
4,Nice hatchet,"I really like the feel and light weight of the hatchet but i did not expect it to have a hollow handle, i plan to use this for my back pack so the light weight is great but if your going to give me a hollow handle then lets make it useable, like a knife that fits into it or even just a plug on the end to keep some dry tinder inside, maybe i should just invent my own hatchet.I do like the curved end to help keep your hand from sliding off if it's wet or something, Low's also has a nice hatchet with a curved hook end, but it has nail puller on the head, nice extra. could not find it on line only at our local store in the garden area.Chop, Chop, Chop,"
3,Not impressed,"I purchased this because of the great reviews, but really, im no more impressed with it than I would be a 10$ Coleman axe. After 1 trip the edge has dulled and even pitted. Dosent seem to hold its edge well... Soft metal? The cool graphite finish also wares off after the first use.at least the orange handle makes it easy to find around the camp..."
4,Irri-tape Bird Repellent,"The product has been in use now for approximately 90 days guarding our magnificant cedar arbor against woodpeckers. It has done a fine job of guarding the arbor and warding off attacks by the areas many woodpeckers. It is noisy when it is windy and the Irri-Tape is somewhat fragile for a product of this price, coming apart in the wind and requiring regular follow up and repair efforts and associated time that should definitely not be necessary. The product would be enhanced by and should be strenthened with fibreglass or nylon threading in the manufacturing process."
2,don't waste your money,I have used much cheaper products that worked or at least greatly lessened the coarseness and quantity of hair. None of them completely got rid of the hair and some are no longer available. The e-pen did not help in any significant way and it's inconvenient and expensive to have to order replacement pads and gel.
4,Engrossing,"I picked this book up in the store and read the whole thing right there (and then forgot the title and author! I'm glad to have rediscovered this information). The book doesn't quite feel like fiction-- with its attentiveness to detail and its impressive ability to convey the complexities of both author's and patients' situations, all the characters feel so real. What was the Kirkus Reviewer yawning over?"
5,The American Story,"While reading a Bridge from Nowhere I had a persistent thankful feeling that I'm talking to a close friend. I wasn't alone anymore in trying to explain the way it was and the way it is. Somehow if we don't remind others, they forget and their forgetfulness is dangerous, it could hurt the ones who just started on their courages way to our America. The story of America is a story of each and every person who came here from somewhere else and then it's the story of continuation - it's about our survival. Thanks Bena for reminding us."
4,Disney Passporter,I like the ability to store any of those necessary and not so necessary extra travel papers/plans in the pocket.My son liked this guide immensely. He used it to scout out the rides and shows he wanted to see so that we could all compare lists.
4,Great tool for planning you Disney vacation!,"Are you planning a trip to Walt Disney World? If so, this book is as far you need to look for information! It includes in depth reviews of all on-site restaurants and hotels and reviews for all rides and attractions from multiple points of view. (even a kid's review) All the pockets and blanks to fill in also make it super convenient when it comes to making all of those final plans. You can keep all your travel and reservation information in one secure, easy to carry item! The only reason I give this 4 stars is because some of the ticket information is a little outdated (but who can keep up with Disney and its ever changing ticket system). The Passporter has been an wonderful tool to help plan my vacation!"
2,Not very informative,"This book is great if you know absolutely nothing about WDW. However, if you are a veteran or have even minimal working knowledge of the parks and resorts, I wouldn't recommend this book. The organizer is way too simplistic to be useful and most of the information is common knowledge to most WDW fans."
5,Vacuum bags work great - great price,"I was always trying to find these bags and had to go to a local (very rude) vacuum store. I finally got fed up and looked online. I saw these bags and thought ""what a great price"". They came shipped quickly and the product seems to be performing well. I have no complaints and will be ordering more when I need them."
3,Vac bags,"Works on other manufacturers and models, too. Here, these bags serve their purpose in a Hoover. Bad enough I have to use bags at all."
3,GREAT...until...,"This MP3 player was GREAT when I got it, at a great price. The company discontinued making MP3 players while I owned it, so when the hard drive crashed, I was unable to get it repaired anywhere. I used it a lot, so it wasn't that old when the bad drive made it...useless. Thank you, Virgin Electronics, for not supporting what you sold! Keep up customer service like that, and you may lose users (a.k.a. CUSTOMERS) of devices you still make!"
1,Do not bother with this junk!,"I purchased this MP3 player about 18 months ago. I bought new, not refurbed.PRO:- When the player works, it plays music.CON:- This has been orphaned by Virgin. No updates. No information- Only works with Windows Media Player 10. Does not work with WM11- Uploading of songs is slow. Not the transfer, but the management in WM10- Regularly loses list of songs. This requires format and reinstall of MP3 Player OS and upload of songs- Battery has limited life. Recharge after 8 hours is a good day- If you listen to audio books, this is a horrid player. It does not have any bookmark capability, so you will have to learn to split MP3 files to 5 minute chunks or you will spend much wasted time moving forward and back in your file to find your spot.- Fast forward and rewind are incredibly slowI just gave my teenaged daughter an MP3 player for her birthday. This time, I stuck with the big names. I gave her a Creative Zen. Do not waste you money on the Virgin piece of ****."
5,Simple If You Read Directions,"I purchased this even after reading the number of bad reviews. I figured at the $79.99 price, what the heck. I have been pleasantly surprised.No problem transferring songs. Sound is great, radio works wonderfully and I am even able to transfer files to and from work using it. You can't ask for anything more!!It seams the other problems people are having is trying to make it work the way they want it to, not the way it is designed. Follow directions and it is great!"
1,Junk,This is the worst pice of electronics I ever bought. Started falling apart after few days only. Battery life is a joke.Software that comes with it is totally unfriendly and even if you manage to install that thing on your computer it won't work with OS prior to XP. You will find that out after you're done installing it. Mediocre performance. Don't waste your money on this one.
1,Worst product,"Please save yourself from this crap. This is not worth even a penny. I recvd it a couple of days back and opened the box today for the first use. Connected to the PC , completed that really tough installation and started transferring the files... and guess what .. it crashes all of a sudden !!! I follow all the instructions in the FAQ section of Virgin Electronics, but none works. All the time it has only this piece of info to displayOh dear! This hard drive isn't working properly !!!........Decided to return it. Do not even for a second think of taking this product. Save your hard earned money for some other worthy product !!!"
4,Timex Men's Camper Fullsize Watch #T46141,"I'm a nursing student and I wanted a watch that had a second hand that I could see. I like the watch because it has a big face, numbers, white background and the day. Shine a light on the watch and the hands, second hand, and dots by numbers glow in the dark. (I like the Indoglo light feature also.) I didn't care for the watch band so I changed it. I checked hundreds of Timex watches on-line and finally found this one that had all features that I was looking for. I got it for under $27 & free S&H. The only other Timex watches that came close to what I was looking for was the T42571 and the T46131."
1,misleading description,"First of all, the product description is wrong. The case and bezel are not stainless steel, but cheap black plastic.Second, the watch ticks very loudly. I don't know if this is a mechanical problem that only affected my watch or if it's a feature of this model, but the ticking was so loud, I couldn't fall asleep with the watch on my nightstand. And when I was wearing it, I would constantly hear it ticking, no matter where my arm was.If you are in the market for a cheap, plastic analog watch, you can find something better for half the price."
3,"This is the Kirkpatrick, not the Hollander edition!","All the reviews so far are for the translation by Robert and Jean Hollander; however, this version is NOT their translation. It's a new version by Robin Kirkpatrick, which I've yet to see, so I can't comment on it, except to recommend others not rely on the reviews here too much, since they are of a different translation."
5,No need to say more,"I love this book! It's the third in the ""Legend of the golden feather"" series and I did all my praising in my very limited English vocabulary under the prequels ""Bristlecone Peak"" and ""The protectors"". So there is no need to say more, because everyone reading this either already found the other two books or should immediately search them because this is definitely not a stand-alone story. You will love Jake and Wiley and will close this book with a big grin on your face after finishing. Promise!"
3,Reasonably useful and very boring,"No idea at all in this book... Just check lists. Long, very long check lists (I hardly exagerate). You may find it useful, and it certainly is, at least a little. Or you may find that succeeding in a merger is not only a matter of ticking all the items of a long list..."
1,Terrible Packaging,When I received HP Brochure paper I ordered it came without the HP box in a thin USPS mailer that was torn to shreds leaving the paper inside useless. The Brochure paper was too heavy for the thin mailer. The paper should have been left in the HP box shown on the product page an protected by a regular box.
5,Very helpful! Demystifies Indian Cooking,"This book has been very enjoyable. This book has a wide variety of recipes, and they are made with ingredients that are easy to find. I was amazed at how many recipes can be made with ingredients that we have on hand. This book is well organized, and best of all it offers a picture of every single recipe. So you know what it is going to look like. The recipes that I have tried have been very good, and enjoyable. This book gets very high ratings since the recipes are written clearly, even for the begining cook. My only minor complaint with this book is that all recipes are not given in their actual name but generic names. Still if you are looking for a book for the beginner, or if you are just starting to get interested in Indian cooking, this is a great book to start with."
1,Do not waste your time or why is Amazon Pushing the Junk,"Do not waste your time or why is Amazon pushing this piece of junk.Poorly written, combined with poor advice makes this book a waste of money and time. Commercial interests hype the book, yet there is little in it that is compeling."
1,Speak to influence who?,"Quite honestly I found myself very bored reading this book. It's an OK book if you want to learn how to speak in general, but look elsewhere if your wanting to get into voice-overs. This book did absolutely nothing for me, in voice-overs or otherwise.Yawn."
3,wide heel,"The leather in this shoe is soft like butter. Love that. Love the support and the soft, flexible sole. My big complaint is that the heel is so wide that my foot slips out. I never have this problem with any other brand. This is the second Easy Spirit shoe to give me this grief. This is very disappointing because they are one of the few brands to offer attractive but comfortable shoes."
5,The Lost Art of Burlesque,"This book was obviously a labor of love for author, Jane Briggeman. She brings to life a time when showgirls started in the chorus and the outstanding ones went on to become stars of Burlesque. The pictures are wonderful. This would make a perfect present for someone who longs for the ""good old days.""Every fan of vintage theatre performances should have this book. It is tasteful, imaginative and informative, bringing back the days when couples went to Burlesque theatres for a wonderful show. These were the days of glamour when beautiful women danced across the stage in fabulous gowns and furs."
5,"""Burlesque "" by Jane Briggeman","Slipping behind the scene, author and founder of the Burlesque Historical Society, Jane Briggeman,draws the reader into the dressing rooms and personal lives of the woman and men of burlesque.Peppered troughout the book are beautiful photographs that show lots of curves, georgious gowns and costumes that bring the art of the dance into the readers mind.Jane Briggeman covers all the ground from men performing baggy pants comedy to the burlesque stars and big production shows.The author writes about burlesque's high popularity as well as its low periods when threatened by repressive times. Her impressive collection of burlesque memorabilia would be a welcome addition to any writers research library. Briggeman reveals heart and soul in ""Burlesque"". The size of the book and the attractive high gloss red cover makes this a very classy coffee table conversation piece. Go out, buy the book and have some fun, it's a very exciting read."
4,"Good, but...","This book is full of wonderful memorabilia, but it's a little weird that the author doesn't mention, or never has heard of, the neo-burlesque movement that has sweeped America and parts of the World. Rhapsodizing about performances she has never seen seems to be her way of romanticizing the past. There's no denying the book has wonderful photos, and the author's collection is full of amazing items. Even if she doesn't like the current burlesque scene, it's something she should comment on. Even the NY Times has written about the current burlesque revival! Nowhere does she mention Teasorama, the NY Burlesque Fiestival, or Exotic World, though she talks about the Museum. It's a flaw in an otherwise entertaining book.Caveat: I am very much a part of the NY scene, stage managing and helping in a variety of shows, so perhaps I'm prejudiced."
5,Great!!!,The books in the series are short but well done. The ending was great and the whole book was action packed. If you liked lord of the rings books or movies you like these.
3,Could have been better...,"It seems to be a fairly common complaint, but this is just not what I'm used to getting from Ms. Cornwell. Is she shrugging off her readers because of the personal drama the press has played out about her Lucy-like experiences. I don't think that gives her an excuse to be a bad writter. This is an amazing storyline but the book is a shell of what it should have been. I've always admired the reality of her writing (having lived in Richmond, I know most of these places). Until now I've been able to believe in it. I've been to Tangier Island, and although her description is dead on, it's only a half-truth. She should have made the positive, quaint feeling part of the horror. There are too many questions left unanswered (and we shouldn't have to wait till ""Point of Origin""), too many characters that are acting strange, too much laziness in the writing. I'm definitely not snatching up Point of Origin until it's gone to paperback. I'm almost afraid..."
3,"A page turner, but I want a new last page!","Kay Scarpetta must be sleepless at night. Not a single character followed his/her personality. I was even disappointed in Marino. Cornwell is definitly one of the best mystery writers out there, and I have read about 7 of her novels. I will continue to do so. But this time, I did not want to be Kay Scarpetta, I wanted to be one of the reporters-talk about angst against a single group of people. Can't make up my mind about this one. I think I'll go back a ways and try some other older ones. The publisher needs to be more critical, her name will sell the book, but her amazing and gripping writing will keep the readers. Better luck next time, Dr. Cornwell."
3,Good but not her best,I read anything that Cornwell writes but I have not thought her last couple of novels have been up to the extremely high standards she set in her initial novels. Still - I'll keep coming back...
2,1st and last Scarpetta book I will ever read.,"Never read any of P Cornwell's books before. Since I like mysteries with tidbits about some interesting hobby, avocation, or profession, the Scarpetta seemed like a good idea. I was totally turned off. what intelligient person would be so mellow about exposure to smallpox? scarpetta's character makes a big deal about an assistant's hiv status, then when the caca hits the fan, the potboiler approach to the assistant's status is turned way down. his part in the outcome is dismissed in a few short sentences. plot twist at the end stretches even the most ignorant person's credibility. from now on i'm sticking with kinsey milhone and holly winter."
3,"Well, it was a book.","This was my first time ever reading anything by Patricia Cornwell. Being a high school student I thought that the book wouldn't keep my interest for very long...well I was right. The book in my opinion started off quite slow but as the plot progressed it became a little more interesting. I wish I could say I read it in a matter of days, but the truth is it took me a Little bit longer. I had to read the book in sections because some parts just wasn't doing it for me. The ending was a little disappointing but did provide some closer. Aside from the technical drivel and totally gruesome descriptions, I'd say it was a book."
3,I will wait for paperback version of next Scarpetta book....,"I was such a fan of Cornwell's when she started the Kay Scarpetta books. The forensics, plots and characters were terrific. The last couple have gone downhill and this one hit bottom. Scarpetta, instead of coming across as intelligent, interesting and human is boring and tiresome. Can this woman never have, even a modicum of a sense of humor? Personally I don't know how she can be an M. E. and not have any light moments in her life in which to keep her sane. As far as the plot goes, there was a lot to be desired here. If you were not paying close attention, you would not know who the ""killer"" was, as they were mentioned very casually earlier on. There didn't seem to be much motivation for said killer to do what was done. I am not motivated to recommend this book."
2,Killer has little to do with the story,"As usual, Patricia Cornwell writes a great story that seems to be moving towards a very climatic finish -- only to produce an obscure killer who had little or nothing to do with the plot. This is a tremendous let down for the reader. In ""Unnatural Exposure"" this is particularly frustrating. The ending happened so quickly, I went back to see if I had missed something significant (like a clue) that would have let me know that the killer was actually tied to the plot. Someone needs to instruct Ms. Cornwell as to the importance of character development and relevance to the storyline."
3,"Good, but not my favorite","This story is a good read, but I'll admit I enjoyed the others better. Still, if you're a Kay Scarpetta fan, you'll want to include this in your reading of the series."
5,An unidentified virus epidemic appeared in Virginia,AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARH!! This is THE BEST book that I've ever read. I just couldn't put it down!!! My teacher had to tell me to quit reading it!!!! Read is book!!! It's SO captivating!!
4,She keeps getting better,I've read all of the Dr. Scarpetta mysteries that are out in paperback and each one gets better. Cornwell is developing a flair for character development. I'm waiting desperatly for the next one to come out in paperback so I can find out what happens next.
1,reality check: pathologists are the dumbests MDs around,"It's funny: at med school a continuing joke is that the worst med students, at the bottom of the class, wind up as pathologists, because at least then they can't kill anyone. Here we're presented with a humorless, unlikable protagonist who is constantly flattered and told how brilliant she is -- I had heard these were bad, but I tried two and these really are the worst crime novels I've ever read. I know my dissenting vote won't affect the true fans, but this is subliterary dreck."
2,Misses the mark,"I've been a fan of Patricia' Cornwell's books for some time, and this one just not up to her usual level of quality.The book has a wonderfully interesting idea regarding the MO of the killer, but dissapointingly, this idea along with the character of the killer, is not really developed to the extent that you expect from earlier Cornwell novels.Most of the book revolves around sub-plots of the relationships between the many characters that have become part of Kay Scarpett's life over the series of Novels. Unfortunately this comes at the expense of the story about the villain and the crimes.My preference is for the earlier, leaner, Kay Scarpetta books that concentrate on the murder mystery, the science of forensics, and the interplay between Marino and Kay."
5,Unnatural Exposure by Patricia Cornwell,"Once again Patricia Cornwell does not dissapoint her avid reading fans with ""Unnatural Exposure"". This is the second time I have read all of her novels except the latest one that just came out in 2005. I turned 50 this year and treated myself to all of her collection in hardback. I have to honestly say she is my favorite writer...hands down. This novel just like any of hers is facinatingly detailed with forensic discoveries about medical examiner, Kay Scarpetta's,fast paced life in her Virginia hometown. Not only do you visualize the crime detail through her writing, you are also treated to a glimpse into her home, and her Italian heritage.Can't get enough,Maggie"
3,What happened to the climactic ending?,"This was the first Patricia Cornwell book that I've read and I was impressed with her attention to detail. It was a good read, but the ending? Where's the climactic ending? It was as if the author ran out of time and came up with some lame ending just to meet a deadline. After reading the reviews of her other books and I might take a chance and read another one of her books."
2,Not As Good As The Others,"It'll do if you just need to read something. Kay Scarpetta has just about played out with me. I'd like to read a book by Ms. Cornwell entitled ""The Bloody Murder of Lucy"" with this happening in the first paragraph. This character elimination would delight me and I'd certainly buy that book."
2,"Overall, I was disappointed","I think that Patricia Cornwell is heading downhill. I was very disappointed with Hornet's Nest but I hoped with a return to her regular character, she would regain her prior form. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The first half of the book was fine, with lots of detail, but in the second half I felt like she was rushing and left out every other sentence. At one point Kay Scarpetta was in Utah, and in the next sentence KS was in Virginia. What happened to transitional sentences, like, ""I got on the plane and flew home.""? Major plot lines were left hanging; manycharacters were introduced but issues were never resolved. Some characters were introduced--as if they were important--and then never visited again. I felt like the whole book was rushed and not well researched. On the issues of virology, it is clear that Ms. Cornwell is not an expert--and when the writing gets technical, she just skips over details big and small. Overall, I was disappointed."
2,Boring.,"Redundant in many technical explanations-and not so technical.Pat, do you really have to explain what every acronym means? I pitythe person who doesn't understand that AOL refers to America Online. Give readers a little more credit than that!"
4,What a relief!,"After a disappointing showing with Hornet's Nest, hurrah to PatCornwell for a return to Kay Scarpetta. Not only does she decide tostick with the tried and true, but the development of Dr. Scarpetta as a woman with a real life (complete with love and loss) gives her readers something more to anticipate. I just can't wait to know what happens to Lucy's career."
4,amazing,"i am a fan of all Patricia Cornwells books. i found this one very interesting and it passed the time by very fast. i couldn't put it down. i must agree that Kay isn't the most open with the people she loves but that is her character. i find it easy to slip into her world where men used to rule and now she is stepping on toes. i'm very interested in the forensic part and the actual autopsy she illustrates. i also like how she links actual events into her stories. for example the oklahoma city bombing, waco texas,and the unabomber. it gives it a more real feeling. i love these books and i slip into the complicated and fast paced world of Kay Scarpetta as often as possable."
2,The Brilliant Cornwell is slipping,"What promised to be yet another great book by Patricia Cornwell ended up being a less than average read. This book along with her last; Hornets Nest were both a disapointment compared to her other brilliant books, my favourite being Cruel and Unusual which was a Golden Dagger winner."
3,First 2/3 of the book is good--last 1/3 DISAPPOINTING!!,"I enjoyed the first 1/2 or 2/3 of the book--there were some ""annoyance factors"", but liked the story. What happened then? Was the last third of the book tacked on in an evening or what? The ""resolution"" was confusing and made no sense to me, there was no further explaination of what happened to 2 major characters that were more fully explored in the beginning, and many loose ends were left open. I stayed up late finishing this book and wish I'd gotten some much-needed sleep--I am starting to feel as ill-tempered and obnoxious as Dr. Scarpetta is beginning to seem! :)"
1,Run out of ideas,"I am not going to take the time to write a long review, because PC's most recent effort simply is not worth it. Having resd a number of Dr. Kay books, I was expecting an entertaining read. Rather, I was annoyed and disappointed. I felt that I had read it before. There was nothing new. Her niece is in trouble, her love life in shambles, no one under stands, blah blah blah. And, she ends up in the house alone with a killer, needing to be rescued by the FBI or Marino, or whoever...Can we say ""I have run out of ideas."""
1,This was a book?????,"As a virgin Patricia Cornwell reader, I'm sorry to have lost my innocence on this piece of trash. If Kay Scarpetta is anyone's idea of an intelligent, caring, ""functional"" individual, my heart sincerely goes out to that person. ""Unnatural Exposure"" was an average book outline - with much work left to do to flesh out characters and complete storylines within the plot. What was the point of the possible tie-in to dismemberments in Ireland? Why did Scarpetta have PMS throughout the entire book? Did Ring ever get the come- uppance he was supposedly going to get? What drug was Cornwell on when she devised the ending - or was she merely sleeping?Actually, the real question is ""WHO CARES!"" My primary problem with the book was that I felt obligated to finish the pathetic thing, hoping against hope that it would get better. I was wrong. Sorry, Patricia - I lived my whole life without knowing who you were prior to seeing this book, and I'm headed straight back there . . ."
4,Pretty good quick read. PC's been better and worse.,"Up until Unnatural Exposure, there has been a trend towards the unblelievable in PC's Kay Scarpetta books. Early on, her books were straight whodunnit -- in the tradition of Sherlock Holmes. Kay is at her best when she's picking apart fibers, doing autopsies, and doing straight forensic work. And when she's in a good mood. In Unnatural Exposure, Kay was in a bad mood the whole time. She did, however, manage to get back to a bit of what she does best -- being the Medical Examiner. All in all, I was pleased that Unnatural Exposure was better than Cause of Death -- which reeked. But it's still not her best. Before writing her next book, I hope PC goes back and reads Postmortem, Cruel & Unusual, All That Remains, and From Potter's Field. They're vintage Kay Scarpetta and Patricia Cornwell. One last note: I agree. Chuck the Lucy storyline. She's obnoxious."
4,"Very good, although not excellent, return to Scarpetta","I'm not sure if I enjoyed this book because I thought""Hornet's Nest"" was so bad that I was relieved or if it wasthe return of Kay Scarpetta that hooked me.For whatever reason, I thoroughly enjoyed this latest entry in the Kay Scarpetta saga. I really enjoyed all of the technical stuff as well as the personal relationships -- particularly between Kay and Lucy.And, I really didn't know ""whodunnit"" until the end and was surprised.I would recommend this book highly, especially to those who have enjoyed Cornwell's past books. If you've never read a Patricia Cornwell mystery before, I'd start with one of the early books and work my way forward to this one."
2,Adieu Patricia Cornwell,"After having been disappointed with HORNET'S NEST, I relishedthe idea of reading about my friend Dr. Kay Scarpetta. However,Patricia Cornwell's new book UNNATURAL EXPOSURE was even more of a disappointment. I, for one, believe her greatest book to be BODY FARM. The villian had a sense of purpose, character and became a challenge to Kay...Alas, I felt the character development was weak, the plot predicable and far below standard. I'm sorry to say I will not be wasting my precious spare time dawdling over a Cornwell book when there's so many eloquent writer's out there."
2,If you like Scarpetta - -,"Then you'll probably like this story.My wife and I read books together and I'd sworn off Cornwell after Hornet's Nest (which on TV Cornwell admitted was some warmed over college material - and it showed horribly). The Scarpetta character (in some books) is unbelievably emotionally ultra-hyper (going from confident to terrified every time Marino knocks on the door).In this book she was mercifully level headed almost ALL the time! What a relief. And there was a real story. I'm not really a fan of her work over the last 10 years but there's almost enough lab details here to satisfy. Sure wish she (Scarpetta) would learn to delegate - imagine the top lab expert for her state and she has to go to every crime scene and move bodies herself!Anyway don't start here with the Scarpetta series - but if you already like the character, this one is a B+. Compared to other crime novels in general, it's still a C- in my estimation."
2,Worst Cornwell I've read,"I've generally liked Cornwell's books, but this one was weak. I'd look elsewhere if you want to read Cornwell. The ending came very abruptly, with little climax or excitement."
3,Not one of her best,"It was a relief to get Dr. Scarpetta back after the awful ""Hornet's Nest"", but this book certainly doesn't measure up to her earlier work.I find it absolutely unbelievable that Dr. Scarpetta would be allowed to leave the isolation unit that quickly. It also bothers me that one of the victims, who is 52 years old, is described as ""elderly"". Excuse me? If a realistic time line were followed in these novels, Dr. Scarpetta herself would be 50 or very close to that. It seems an author's vanity to have the main character remain ever young and sexy, while her niece ages by approximately l5 years! If Cornwell wants us to believe Kay is one hot mama, she ought to keep Lucy at age l5!"
4,She swings for the fences and hustles out a triple.,"I was also disappointed by ""Cause of Death"" and was waiting for Cornwell to redeem herself. I think this book is a sign she's on her way back. I found the plot thoroughly believeable because the Maryland and Virginia coastline are now recovering from a mysterious fish bacteria that has stymied seafood sales in the area and threatened the economy of the fishermen. I also didn't mind her saving Lucy's court showdown until the next book. It will be interesting to see how that turns out. Yes, the villain was kind of obscure but I still enjoy Cornwell's melding of medical science and mystery. It's no ""Cruel and Unusual"" but, I'll continue to read her stories and appreciate the insightful forensic trivia that comes along with it."
2,Unkept Promise: Cornwell is 'circling the drain'.,"At what point in a successful writer's career does she get bored with her own work or, worse,become so valuable a publising property that any evidence of editorial assistance disappears? If you were charting Cornwell's stock as a commercial endeavor: BUY, but as a developing work with tighter plot lines and more intricate personalities: SELL. The 'willing suspension of disbelief' is essential for any fiction:Cornwell's plot lines stretch the faith,and the endings are moving from fiction into fantasy. The fact that all her titles become bestsellers is akin to gulls following the garbage barge. It's a boat I have been on.............I'm getting off."
2,Definitely not her best,"After the disappointment of Hornet's Nest, I rushed out to buy UE. I enjoyed the beginning, but got more and more disappointed. Like other reviewers, I did not remember the villain.Was this a rush job? Also, PLEASE, Scarpetta, stop whining all the time!Scarpetta has changed a lot from the strong woman she was in early books - maybe she should get rid of Benton - he seems to bring out the worst in her.Please no more Italian recipes - if I want them, I will by an Italian cookery book.Still, I am most probably going to by the next Scarpetta novel, to see whether things (plots) are improving.Susanne"
1,Call the medical examiner!,This patient is DOA! I anxiously awaited the release of this book since Kay Scarpetta is one of my favorite fictional characters. Thank goodness I got it at the library. It was awful! The plot was old & tired. It was also a very easy read (large print and big margins). I hope Ms. Cornwell doesn't succumb to publisher pressure with her next Kay Scarpetta. Let's get back to the original plots and developed storylines.
4,the book was not that good but better then the last one.,I think that scarpetta is getting to jumpy and suspisice ofevreything . I think that the only interesting part of the book wasthe villian and it does not come together untill the last chapter. Also is the last words of the book was as corny as the subject. So cornwell ethier needs new ideas or scarpetta needs to expire.
2,Yet another formulaic page turner,"Ms. Cornwell tells us about Dr. Scarpetta's sad and unhappylife once again. At one point, I actually hoped Kay Scarpetta didhave the dreaded pox so Cornwell could move on to another character. I have heard in the past about her sloppy writing with respect to dates and locations. I have another to add. While they are investigating the camper van for clues (in full biological containment suits) Kay stirs a cactus pot and feels that the soil is damp. Interesting thing to do with gloves on. She also visits previous territory done much better by Reich's in ""Deja Dead"". The cut marks on bone did get a bit gruesome. It is nice to see Cornwell is reading other people's books as well. The end was sappy and allowed for an even sappier sequel. Maybe if she had gone the conspiracy route the next book would have been better. I did not spend hard earned dollars on this book. I borrowed it from our local library (I love being married to a librarian!)."
1,"Could a ""bestseller"" be any more disappointing?","This was my first PC book. It will certainly be my last. The characters were so pooly defined I never did relate to them. The dialog was shallow and inconsequential. And while the premise of the book did, indeed, hook me - it failed to deliver even 1/10th of its promise. Particularly disappointing is the author's attempt to inject modern technology and themes into this novel. Please - at least do a little research! It is painful to see her try to explain that which is obviously out of her reach. My recommendation: pick up another book .... any book!"
3,Too much autopsy - too little suspense,"I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's books with Kay Scarpetta so far but I'm not sure I'll keep on reading them. All though Unnatural exposure is somewhat better than Cause of death it was still a disappointment. Cornwell has moved away from the suspense that was prominent in her earlier novels on to page up and page down with autopsy details and an unbelivable admiration for the FBI. Many sideline stories and persons could have been developed more, now the ending was abrupt and the reader was not given much of a chance of guessing the identity of the killer. It feels like massproduction (of crime novels)."
2,Not as good as the others in the series,"I first starting having problems with Scarpetta when she had the affair with Benton and seemed entirely too cavalier about the whole thing. The character started to get on my nerves then and has continued in this book to be so. She is basically entirely unsympathetic throughout, being either b*tchy or whiny in turns.As for plot, I was completely baffled by the revelation of the murder at the end. Where did that come from? What was the tie-in with Ireland? Why was she so dismissive of her (always loyal) lab assistant? And where was the fear that was so much a part of the other books?"
2,"An o.k. book, but not one of her best.","I have to say I was disappointed by Patricia Cornwell's latest Scarpetta novel. I'm getting the feeling the author is running out of ideas for her main character(s). Perhaps Ms. Cornwell should consider taking some time off to get away from the world of Scarpetta and to develop entirely new material. I'm REALLY glad I waited to get the paperback, instead of springing big bucks for the hardback. Better luck next time."
2,Never again,"I am a big Cornwell fan; however, this is the first time I purchased an audio version of her book to enjoy on a long car ride. The book is ruined by this particular reader, Kate Reading. I cannot finish listening to it so I plan on getting a printed version to finish it. I am not against audio versions and have enjoyed many other authors in the past. The publisher/author need to do a better job finding an appropriate reader to interpret the text."
3,Better than Hornet's Nest,"Scarpetta's back and that is very good news. This is a much better book than Hornet's Nest, but then again, what book wasn't, however, this is far from the normal Kay Scarpetta adventure. The plot line is good, but you get the feeling all through the book that the author was rushed into telling it. This is absolutely true at the end where everything is explained in a brief, somewhat unbelievable burst. There are many questions unanswered, even when Cornwell does answer them. The ending to Scarpetta's lingering love for her dead boyfriend is outlandish and much too pat. And the identity of the killer!!!!, Patricia Cornwell should definitely get the dreaded Red Herring award for this one. No clues, and no satisfactory reason why or how it was solved. I'm glad Cornwell has returned to familiar ground, but this one was very unsatisfying. Maybe it's just the lingering malaise from Hornet's Nest, we can only pray. Steve Isenhowe"
2,Unnatural Exposure not as good as earlier books,"Patricia Cornwell's newest Kay Scarpetta novel, Unnatural Exposure, is almost as disappointing as Hornet's Nest. While the main story line of a disturbed person using biological agents as a weapon is interesting, the book ends in a rush without a satisfying conclusion. The writer's attempts to flesh out the characters' personalities fall flat, swinging wildly from important details of the character's motivation to an intrusion to the storyline. Some of the details seem to me to be very contrived and more than a little implausible, especially Dr. Scarpetta's ability to mobilize the Army and the CDC on a moment's notice. I bought this book in hardcover, as I have all her recent books, but I'll be waiting for the paperback from now on"
4,Typically suspenseful Scarpetta novel.,"Another typically engrossing classic Scarpetta, but one criticism is that it came to an end all too quickly. I felt that Cornwell had been limited to the number of words allowed in the novel, and found that she had reached the limit and had to reveal all in a page or two. It was as if the killer had appeared ""out of the blue"", that is hadn't been introduced in order that we may add ""the killer"" to a list of suspects. That will not stop me buying the next Scarpetta novel. I've bought them all. I can't wait till they come out as movies. Well Patricia"
1,Save Your Money and Your Time,"I've been a Cornwell fan for a long time, but lately I think she's on vacation from writing good books. If you're interested only in reading about grisly body dismemberment and disgusting diseases, then this one's for you. There was so little story to go along with the sensationalism that you'd be better off reading anything but this book! This is going to be my last Cornwell book!"
3,Entertaining,"Reminding this book is suppossed to be a forensics thriller, I liked it. I mean, I wasn't expecting car chases or a M.E. turned cop carrying a gun or wrestling someone into the ground. The descriptions of virus, methods, and so on are good for me. This is not suppossed to be Tom Clancy or Fredric Forsyth. If you're interested in forensics this is a great read."
1,Same old material and too too much personal angst,"I've read several of Cornwell's mysteries, and perhaps I've just picked the wrong ones. I'm so tired of hearing of the evil Carrie and what she did to poor Lucy and other recurring major characters. I've also lost interest long ago in the love life of just about every recurring character in this series. Furthermore, it's too bad the author can't present pathology without excessive gore. Please, Ms. Cornwell, come up with something new and ease up on your noble heroine's ongoing private problems (or at least change them a little). I really enjoy ME mysteries and would like to see something similar to the approach of ""Silent Witness"" or the latest J. Deaver books (minus the heavy gore)."
4,"Unnaturally Good, Just Not Great","This is a good medical thriller. It involves a weird pox-like bug that keeps killing individuals. Scarpetta is forced to find out who unleashed this horrid plague in order to prevent further death and demise. I am not a doctor, well not a medical doctor, so that portion of the book sounded realistic to me. The suspense was set very nicely in a readable book that moves along very quickly and is never boring. The writing is very good and serves to set up a good summer read. Anyway, it is worth a read, so get it and enjoy."
2,"Disappointing, slow-moving,far-fetched Kay Scarpetta tale!","Thank goodness I'm not the only one becoming disillusioned with Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta character. As oftentimes happens, her first novels were much better than the last several published. Are they just being turned out for their dollar return. Unnatural Exposure reached midpoint in the book before it gained any interest for me. The story line is so unbelievable it makes one wonder that we should reclassify Cornwell's tales as Sci-Fi. The ending was just as anticlimatic as the entire book. Bring back the interesting, thought-provoking tales of years gone by. The only interesting character remaining is Det. Marino"
2,Not worth the read,"The synopsis on the book made the book sound ""WONDERFUL"" but unfortunately, it told you the WHOLE ENTIRE plot of the whole story...The Ending was horrible too....And I had no idea who the killer was in the end"
1,The whole book was a bore from start to finish.,"When Cornwell started the Dr.Scarpetta stories I was very happy to find a new thriller on the market. With this book however, I feel that it is time Dr. Scarpetta went to Never Never Land. The book is dull and lifeless and the plot is like trying to get through a maze. Terrible ending. She (Cornwell) does not seem to have the capibility to keep Scarpetta on the cutting edge. Time to move on to new people such as the ones in Hornets Nest. Cornwell evidently does not have what it takes to keep writing about a characture book after book (ala J.A. Jance). Don't waste your time or money"
2,"OK, but definitely not her best","Having read all of PC's books, I find with each one published they seem to get progressively worse. Unnatural Exposure as usual was researched well but there seemed to be too much missing.And Lucy, give me a break. I think the character Lucy is PC and I'm very tired of her. I'm also tired of Kay Scarpetta and Wesly Benton. Which only leaves Marino. He seems to be the only character in her books that has any sort of personality.And what about the ending. Were the publishers pushing her to finish? I thought it was slapped together. I had to go back through the pages to figure out who the killer was.I guess we know what will be in the next book, the continuing saga of poor Lucy and her continual screwups. And please Kay Scarpetta find another boyfriend, one with a personality"
3,Good -- But Not The Best Scarpetta Novel,"This was an enjoyable read -- similar to how eating vanilla ice cream is enjoyable -- but certainly not the calibre of storytelling I've come to expect from Ms. Cornwell. Usually, after I finish a Scarpetta book, I immediately re-read it. Not this time. The story was good -- but the ending was too tidy and put together too quickly. Very happy to see the ghost of Mark being put to rest -- get over it already and move on, Kay! Yes, I am looking forward to the next Scarpetta novel, but I will wait for it to come out in paperback before forking over the big bucks for hardback. Not enough of Pete Marino in this one. Also, I love Lucy -- perhaps a Lucy series about the stuff she works on and her cases for the FBI"
1,Not Even Worth One star,"A big headache,this book has no plausible plot,no story and the way the theme is handled is really pathetic.Patricia tries to do ala Robin cook but she is not even 1% successful.Avoid this book at any cost, or read it at your own headache."
4,Very Good,"""Unnatural Exposure"" is a page-turning read. The use of e-mail in the narrative is an interesting device for anyone like me who is e-mail crazy. ""Unnatural Exposure"" is one of the best thriller novels I've read since Craig Furnas's ""The Shape: A Novel of International Suspense."" (Although I'd rate that one even higher: a 10+. You can get that one on Amazon.com). And the setting of ""Unnatural Exposure"" was particularly welcomed since I'm a fan of Ireland and things Irish. It's a setting not often used in thrillers. For a good read, try ""Unnatural Exposure."""
2,Like so many other authors..,"I just hate it when authors feel they need to produce books..and I do mean produce...not write..Just like Grisham, King, and many others..I would rather wait a year and read a good story rather than have them come off the brain dead assembly line. I do or should I say did like the character of Kay Scarpetta. The whole bit with the e-mail is a bit silly..for such an intelligent character this is one mistake I can't seem to forgive."
2,This work is half a novel with an implausable ending.,This New York Times Bestseller gets two stars because I enjoyed the first 66% of the book. The last third was terrible. The ending does not fit. What happened to Ring? She spent more time describing the military transport aircraft than Wingo's death. I'm also getting tired of the use of two dimentional homophobe characters to validate Lucy's homosexuality.
3,"Recovery, a little, after CAUSE OF DEATH","After the reading of CAUSE OF DEATH, with that silly end, I was worried with the plot of Cornwell's new book.After all the plot of this one is better, so it seems CAUSE OF DEATH was just a low time and now Cornwell is just taking off again. I hope total recovery in her next book."
4,A very definite female perspective.,"Not bad, however the ending could have been more revealing. Left me feeling as if it was quickly ended to meet a deadline. Too much like the silence of the lambs. On a more recent note it was better than the five minute dialogue with the ""bagged"" scientist on Alien 4."
2,Not one of her better efforts - disappointing,"Patricia Conwell's most recent effort was disappointing, at best. The book was difficult to get involved with. Her characters didn't seem sincere - she did not make you care about them - even the victims. Ms. Cornwell rambled through the story until she had enough pages to classify this as a novel - then ended it. There were too many loose ends and the ending was not believeable. If this had been my first purchase of a Cornwell novel, I can tell you that it would be my last. Get with it, Ms. Cornwell."
2,Not One Of Her Best,I am definitely a PC fan. I have read every book that she has written. This one was a big disappointment. The ending made no sense at all. I hope first time readers will not give up on this wonderfully talented writer.
4,Another Kay Scarpetta saga...,"Patricia Cornwell is a brilliant author, making an easy to read murder mystery fascinating and page turning. I have only read a few of the Kay Scarpetta stories, but I have enjoyed them all. This one is not a disappointment."
1,Not impressed,"I've never read one of Cornwell's books before but I've been sampling various authors in this genre this summer. So far this was the worst. Very little suspense, the ending stunk and was unbelievable. I thought, ""I got all the way to the end and that's it!"". The technical detail on computers and the internet was obviously not well understood by the author and in same cases wrong. Makes me question the medical details. No more books by this author for me."
2,Not up to Cornwell standards,"I thought the book was too involved in gorey details..Dr. Scarpetta has always been a character I liked, somehow in this book, I didn't. She seemed to lose her ""personality"" amongst all the saw cuts and body parts..a friend told me not to read it because I would be disappointed - didn't listen..should have..would have stopped reading in the middle if I wasn't such a compulsive book finisher. Here's hoping Scarpetta gets her personality back in the next book."
2,Very descriptive until the ending; where detail is wanted!,"I enjoyed reading about Dr. Scarpetta and I even enjoyed the science, but the ending read as if it was a rushed, ""I better rap this up now"", non-conforming to the rest of the story attempt. Sort of like most of the Star Trek episodes. I hope all Cornwell's books aren't this way."
2,Where is the real Dr. Scarpetta/Patricia Cornwell?,"I have read almost all of the Dr. Kay Scarpetta tales, but this is one that left me more disappointed than satisfied. This story left more cliff-hangers than a Melrose Place episode! It seems as if I have been ""enticed"" into buying the newest addition to the Dr. Kay library just to find out what happened in all of these unfinshed plot lines, but I will wait for the paperback. I enjoyed and miss the thrills of previous books such as From Potter's Field and Cruel & Unusual."
2,Much too technical to be a good read.,"Knowing this was another Scarpetta book, I thought I would be in for some excellent reading. With all the technical language I felt lost in a world of science. And when did Scarpetta become so self centered. I never knew the medical examiner owned the building they worked in. Somewhere along the line, Patricia Cornwell has lost the flavor of Dr. Scarpetta or are we seeing Cornwell become a part of her creation."
2,Suspect??,"This is the first Particia Cornwell book Ive read, and I think that this might be my last. Her attention to detail was spectacular but that was about all that enchanted me.Kay, the famous detective finds a body, but just the torso in a landfill. Later, she recieves anonymous e-mail with pictures of cut-up woman, and finally... a strange virus...?This book is rather grotesque, and is dark. Its not a book to read by the beach, and its not heartwarming nor heartbreaking.As a mystery novel, I felt that Cornwell just needed the suspect. There is not the ""oh my god, who is doing this killing?!?"" kind of excitement nor can one do the usual ""guessing"" of the suspect as in many detective novels.Perhaps for those reading Cornwell for the first time, this is not the perfect book."
2,Predictable,"This is the second novel I have by Patricia Cornwell, and I was greatly disappointed. I felt that there was too much personal struggle and not enough action. One minute the book is dealing with Kay's personal issues and then the book goes back to the terrorist. The themes did not blend as smoothly as they did in The Hornet's Nest."
1,Thank goodness it's over..........,"This was a very ""wordy"" book. There are entirely too many abreviations of agencies that actually don't make a difference in this storyline. I think that the ending was weak...give us a break, at least let the villian be in 2-3 chapters...and by the way, what happened to the neice and her ""lady friend""?? This was left in the air........and, please get your facts straight...there are NO moving sidewalks in the Atlanta airport!!!!! I travel there quite often.....I was happy when it finally ended!"
3,Not Her Best,"I've been reading the Kay Scarpetta series in order from book one, and if you are reading the series, by all means don't skip this one. That said, I got lost in some of the forensic details, I'm just not as up on my saw blades as I should be I suppose. As you can tell from the book jacket, there are murders where the bodies are dismembered, arms, legs and heads sawed off. There have been previous cases in Dublin, and in Virginia. The latest doesn't seem to match that killer though. (we never know who that killer is) The book goes on to a pox like virus and a national health emergency. The killer was introduced early on, but I didn't see the clues leading up to the revelation. But by then, I was just trying to keep up with the different scenarios and lost somewhere in the microbiology and saw blade details.In a long running series such as this, there is bound to be a book that everyone doesn't connect with. It will not deter me from reading the next one."
3,What's with all the high ratings?,"Another Scarpetta book was definitely overdue. I miss Cornwell's writing style that was found in her early books. She is taking Dr. Kay's character on an emotional roller coaster. Get on with it already. She is an intelligent, strong and determined individual. In this book, she appears to be a self-absorbed cry baby. What is with all the self-pity and self doubt. Grow up. This book was too short, too easy to figure out and too depressing. Bring Marino and Lucy back into the big picture. Enough with the psychos chasing her all the time. I want the old Dr. Kay back"
3,Great Value and Some Unusual Items - OK performances,"I give this set somewhat mixed reviews. On the positive side, it is a great value, is well-recorded (especially given that some of the recordings go back to the 50s) , and includes come unusual orchestral works, in addition to 9 operettas. On the negative side, I just don't think these are the best performances of the operettas, in that Sargent really does adopt tempos that often just too slow and the singers sometimes sound just a bit too serious for the roles. My favorite G&S are the recent Telarc performances (Pirates, Pinafore, Mikado, Trial by Jury, and Yeoman) -- great sound, fine singing, and very lively performances."
5,No Better Bargain for Gilbert & Sullivan Fans,"More years ago than I care to remember I purchased Sir Malcolm Sargent's recording of H.M.S. Pinafore and it sold me on Gilbert and Sullivan. Considering its age the sound on this collection has held up wonderfully well and is actually far better than I remember my old LPs sounding. The cast and performances for these works is consistently excellent. Although the set doesn't provide librettos, that's a minor complaint since they can be downloaded at several sites on the web. All in all, this set is a major bargain at the price."
3,Be cautious,"This looks very tempting, but I would really like to hear several excerpts before investing in it. What I have heard of Sargent's turgid tempi in the past have put me off him a a conductor of Sullivan's bright and sparkling melodies."
2,Not the best service,"They resolved my issue however:* My order came in an EMPTY, old, box* When they agreed to send my order they did not overnight it* Customer Service is really poor* The Company has very unprofessional employees* I finally got my watch at a REALLY good price* The warranty certificate through Seiko was missing* I would never order from them again!"
2,ALPHA program rocks!,The Alpha program is a great tool for spiritual formation for any size congegation. My church just started using the program and have developed new relationships amoung members.And we have deepened our understanding of God's purposes for our lives.
1,build your own styrofoam cooler?,"Not good, thin pieces of styrofoam, cut out instructions on how to line your tank with it and some adhesive, wow. Thought I would actually be able to stop my sweating toilet tank from dripping water on the floor, not at all. Waste of money. Would be excellent if you want to make one of those cheap one-use coolers for a camping trip though."
4,perfect size,these dishes are just the perfect size to fix and cook individual meal I wish i had ordered more of them. I am intending to do so later.
5,Great pendant!,"I really enjoy this pendant, it is really good looking and gets people looking at me, not in a wierd way, but in a way that encourages witnessing. When people see this and ask/ know that its Jesus Christ they are prompting the wearer to maybe open up and talk about the person of Jesus Christ and share their faith in Christ.This is a good jewerly peice that encourages conversation and can help one open up with others perhaps a little easier than before."
1,What's up with this ad?,"I am very confused by this ad. I see a picture of a printer, the C9800HN Color Led Printer 36/40PPM 120V E/f/p/s for $193.97. I realized that the price had to be wrong for the printer because other sites offered them for a much, much higher price. When you click on visit this website, it takes you to a page offering a toner cartridge at the price listed but it is not even for the model of the printer pictured in the ad. So this misleading ad needs some cleaning up. Oh yes, and if you go down to product description, it says the product weight is 152.1 pounds. Never a saw toner cartridge that big. If I am wrong and that is the price of a new printer as pictured, I will buy one right now!"
4,JAR,"Does its job, works well. No complaints so far! I like the backlit screen, it can be used easily at night!"
1,not worth it,"If you want a well made gauge, don't buy this one. Very cheap feel and looks, picture only looks good. Instruction say you can release tire pressure, but button at the bottom is only a fixed piece of plastic, it has no function at all. ""SET Your Pressure"" has no purpose, I assume it had something to with the pressure reading but it doesn't. Look for something else."
1,Stopped working within a week,"I purchased the myPSI for myself, and for gifts for the guys this Christmas. My unit stopped working after 1 session. Light works find (very, very bright), but pressure gauge will not take a reading (shows 0.0).I do not recommend this unit. Will be returning mine if I can get it back for less than it cost originally.I have not heard feedback from my family on their units but will report back if I do."
4,good product,"I haven't had a change to really use it yet, however, I tried it see how it works. The light makes a really big difference!"
2,Too many little faults,"After 3 months I have become disappointed. Obtaining a seal has become more difficult. Display becomes unreadable in freezing weather. Too easily switching between psi, bar and kpa. Odd polarization of display lens makes certain angles difficult to interpret the digits. Already a short display time is additionally cut by 2 second boot up cycle."
1,Lousy detector bugged by wireless communication issues,"I have bought this detector one week ago. Upon installlation I was unable to get the antenna and the unit to see each other with the motor running. Still there are certain moments when i can get them to see each other, that is when the engine is off. But you can't get much speed with the engine off unfortunately so I went asking the local Whistler dealer to see if i got a faulty antenna unit. They advised me to return the unit as they had numerous problems with this type of unit and get a 3450."
2,"Great concept, but doesn't work well","I have used Whistler radar detectors for many years and have them on all of my vehicles. This model, which is wireless, was very attractive because of the ease of installation. Unfortunately, the unit mounted under the hood and the display on the interior of the car do not talk to each other well and you are plaqued with messages and beeps saying they are not communication. After having spoken to Manfacturer technical people and doing what they suggested, I have returned the unit for a new one hoping I just got a bad one.Great concept, great features,easy to install as there is no wire to run through the wirewall yo connect the two components. Hope I just happen to get a bad one. I will review the new unit after it is installed and, hopefully, working properly."

1,Poor quality gives one a headache...,"This was a set I was really looking forward to, being a child of the 50's. What a disappointment! The transfer to DVD has a quality reminiscent of a VHS copied twenty times, each from the last copy rather than from the ""master"". I couldn't even bring myself to give them away; I tossed 'em in the trash."
5,An interesting and different format,"I recently had the pleasure of reading Enid Futterman's Bittersweet Journey. Bittersweet is a portrait of Charlotte, her friends and family brought alive by exquisite, unadorned prose and gorgeous photographs. The story of Charlotte's relationship to chocolate parallels her life. The book is interesting also because it contains intriguing information on the myriad varieties and forms of chocolate."
4,A fabulous confection,"Literate and funny, rich as a truffle and light as a souflee. For those who have a hard time deciding between which you like better, sex or food -- now you don't have to."
3,A Bit Dreary,"Perhaps this review is a reflection of similar recordings I own such as those by Trevor Pinnock, Boston Baroque, Talfelmusik, but isn't the pace of these recordings a bit slow? There were times while listening to Suite for Orchestra No. 1 in C major as well as Brandenburg No. 1, for example, that I thought I was going to slip off my chair. Or is it that Menuhin as it right and others have more zip than Bach would have originally desired? Maybe it's just my sense of tempo, but some of these tracks are more mindful of a funeral dirge."
5,A Smart and Funny Book,"My seven year old daughter loved this book, and I did, too. There was a lot of humor, and my daughter was laughing out loud to parts of it. One thing I appreciated was that the book doesn't talk down to kids, the way I think the ""Junie B. Jones"" books do (by using improper grammar and words like ""bestest"" to seem cute). Highly recommended!"
2,didn't enjoy,"I bought this book based on a recommendation in the back of a book I have tons of respect for. I read it to my 2 year old who has had some serious tantrums lately and was not a fan of either the illustrations or the story line. It is not enjoyable to read as the entire thing walks you through the temper tantrum of an annoying toddler and I personally didn't feel that the issue was resolved at the end of the story. My husband read it when he got home and told me later how much he hated it. I hate to give such a negative review, but I really wasn't a fan."
5,childrens book,This story illustrates the very common tantrum we see in most children . The story depicts a child seeing something he/she can not have and acts out accordingly in a very dramatic scene.The pictures help with the true understanding of what the child and adult actually go through during a set back of this nature.
3,In the dirt...,"Meant for academia, it can be dry in areas. However it is thorough and lucid enough for the general reader."
3,Good book for absolute beginners,"I purchased this book along with The Complete Book of Woodworking by Tom Carpenter. Although I like the later more, these two books compliment each other.Perhaps it is a little to strong to say this is a mile-wide and inch deep, but it really is more for the person who knows absolutely nothing. One thing that I especially like is the list of different wood species -- it gives a good comprehensive list.Otherwise, it spends most it's time going over every tool known to God giving a short blurb on each one. If you don't know your tools, this is a great place to start.Anyway, if you were to buy one book, I would recommend the other one mentioned above, but this is still good for a beginner.Michael"
4,"Great book, not so great graphics","Overall I like this book. For a beginner, this is a great book that explains many concepts about woodworking. I especially enjoyed the wood bending techniques explained in the book. It is a great reference for the properties of different species of wood, joinery techniques, and tools.The only thing I didn't particularly care for were the graphics. They're way too busy and have a sort of haphazard feel to them while they're not actually haphazard (if that makes any sense).With some more clear graphics, I'd rate this book 5 stars."
3,Value for money any way you look at it?,"I am using this as a dictionary to look up technical terms: it does cover a lot of ground.Although there are some great pictures in here, on the whole it is too crowded to be useful other than as a dictionary or for getting a few quick pointers. For instance the section on wood has the wood samples so closely together in the pictures that nothing much can be seen of any of them. These same woods are much better treated in 'The_Good_Wood_Handbook' by the same authors (2/3). The same goes (to some extent) for the sections on tools (quite a few of them DO look dated).There is so much in this book that it must be value for money, but actually it is too crammed full of all sorts of stuff to be likable."
4,Great Reference Manual,"This book is ""complete"" in scope and detailed enough. I would recommend it to anyone starting out in woodworking. It is encyclopedic but not an end-all reference. It is a great reference which provides enough information on just about everything you would need to know about woodworking to get started and guide further research. I would give this 4 1/2 stars if I can and would have given the book 5 stars had it been twice as long and gone into complete detail of the more important aspects or most commonly referenced material by amateur and intermediate level woodworkers. This book stays on the side table and I reference it first before further researching whatever I'm trying to do."
5,great reference,"This is NOT a how-to book but it is a superb reference for any questions on tools, joints, woods and basic construction. Look elsewhere for projects because there are none here but definetly a must have from the reference stand point."
1,Horrible guide,"I agree 100% with the other 1 star comment. This is a horrible book if you want to actually ""learn"" how to do any methods in woodworking. First off, the organization of the book is horrible. Twenty pages in the book they already have busy, kid like, unprofessional drawings of building chairs and closets with no background knowledge whatsoever..the schematics are basically useless. This book really is more a picture encyclopedia if old woodworking tools...and I mean old. There is no actual descriptions of methods, basically you will find small, several sentence abstracts about tools INVOLVED with a certain method..but there is still no training or description on how to truly do it. I couldn't be any more disappointed with this book. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DONOT BUY!"
4,A book with plenty of general knowledge about woodworking,If you know what you want to do but you are wondering how to do it or what measurements should be used in furniture or what kind of tools to use this book gives you a lot of good ideas. It covers topics from human ergonometry to different decorative woodworking techniques. None of them very deep but enough to give a general idea about the subject.
4,interesting,"This book was recommended to me by our campus wood artist. It is a good reference for beginning woodworkers, with ideas about wood and projects, tips on power tools, and some good plans for chairs, tables, and other projects. good reference to have, although may be a bit too general for advanced woodworkers."
3,Good House Song with Junior Mix Brings Back Fond Memories from Mid 1990's,I remember jamming to this song in South Beach during the mid 1990's. Good re-mixes of a talented artists who never really hit it big mainstream.
5,ayudame,i need help finding the lyrics to mia! will you help me? please send to maaj16@excite.com. please oh please oh please!
4,helpful and handy,very helpful in areas a regular phone antenna could not handle. gives great reception and makes good phones better.
2,A C- guide,"If you are absolutely desperate for a guide and totally lost...go online and find a nice FAQ or walkthrough. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS unless you have no access to the Internet and have money to waste. The walkthrough is very inaccurate, there is NO ABILITIES SECTION, the last third of the book dealing with ""information"" is useless. It glosses over a great deal of information, and the rest is not mentioned at all. Really, if you're going to buy a guide, buy the Japanese version. It's 20$ more and all, but even if you can't read it at least it has nice pictures, you could probably figure most of it out from them alone."
3,A guide for everything,"If you want a step by step describtion of every event in the game get this guide. If you want to raise monsters, seeds, golems, etc. then don't. The guide only goes over the events in the game and touches on the other stuff only briefly. The other problem is that the guide has you get the final artifact right in the beginning of its chapter 4, this leaves about 35-40 even events to do before it goes over it. I don't know any gamer that would be able to complete the game knowing very well that they could just lay down the Sword of Mana and win the game. The guide was very poorly set up and should have been planned to ensure that the player would get through more than 90% of the game before they could initiate the end game sequence. Don't buy it if you don't have to."
4,It tells the information!,This is a very good Strategy guide for Legend of Mana. It is detailed with maps and a bestiary. This is the best strategy guide.
5,Legend of Mana,"I bought it for my aunt and for my mom they seemed to like it and they seem to be happy with it so as long as there happy I'm happy, so I'm very happy with my purchase."
1,Atrocity,"Legend of Mana is ancient in the game world by now, but just in case, I offer this warning: THIS GUIDE IS A JOKE.The maps are chaotic at best, the events poorly explained, and much of the information is downright wrong. It's as if the authors got bored halfway through the book and just filled in the blanks randomly. For instance: ""Fights: none. When you leave, you will fight Niccolo.""Run, don't walk, to GameFAQS for help on this game."
4,K when you don't know,This was a helpful book to friends and family. It does not promise to be comprehensive and it is not but it is certainly a fair starting point for someone who has not taken up K's teaching yet.
2,Superficial overview of a complex thinker,"Although this book may meet its objective of a brief introduction to Khrishnamurti, I do not think it dwells enough on the critical issues of Khrishnimurti's thought. He may well be the most important teachers of our millinieum, but one does not get enough details from this brief account or his historical importance."
3,"Not such great quality, but ok after we repaired it","This arrived fast - looked pretty good, color was just right.But, the joints were not glued properly and came undone after we put it together. My husband had to do some wood trimming because the joints were not shaped right on the ends of the poles. He also had to glue them and touch up the paint, so overall, it was slightly disappointing, but works ok now. It is sturdy enough for our comforter that we put on it at night."
3,Winsome Quilt Rack,I debated whether or not to rate this as a 4 vs a 3. The reason I rated this as a 3 is that I ordered two of these and one came with two left sides. It took a few weeks to get the right side piece from them. The quality and finish is what one would expect for this price. What I am happy with is their customer service. They responded well and were always courteous. Even though it took a while to get the part they always responded quickly when I requested a status. So product is a 3-4 and customer service deserves a 4-5. Hope this helps.
4,artificial sunlight,Brighten up your portraits with flattering warm light. This little accessory can turn a cloudy dull portrait into something a little more magical. Only good for outdoor use. Indoors it just makes you look yellow.
3,"A good overview, but poorly detailed.","Midway 1942 provides an acceptable overview of the battlebut some of the illustrations are improperly captioned,the author also duplicates some charts for no apparent reason. He also confuses unti designations making it hard to interpret the details he provides. On the positive side this book provides many good pictures and diagrams of Japanese ships and aircraft."
2,A real let down,"I agree with the other reviewers. This book was a real let down. I thought it sounded really good but once I started it I just couldnt get interested. There was just something about the book that was so... bland. It just wasnt written well. I was reading both this book and The Nine Hour Date (which I loved) and I couldnt help comparing the two. This is one of the worst Love Story books I've read, and I've read most of them. If you're a fan of the series you may want to read it, but if you're just looking for a good teen romance, dont even give this bood a glance!"
4,"Teaches - Yes, Annoying - Yes","This is a great educational toy for a young child. It teaches them to zip, button, tie a shoe, and buckle. He says some cute phrases, and kids love him. But as with most Elmo toys, this mom found his voice VERY annoying. He gives you commands that you have to listen to, he will say Brr Elmo is cold, help Elmo put on his jacket.. and sometimes my kids wouldn't have enough time to zip it up for him so he would repeat it, or move on to something else. It is cute, don't get me wrong, but we had to shut off the sounds several times due to the annoying voice :("
1,Proposition 65 warning,"This toy looks great, but I am worried about the Proposition 65 warning (see link in product description above). This warning is frequently used when a product may expose the user to lead."
1,Junk,This product was garbage. The caps don't fit in there and it's made very poorly. you should just throw you money away if you are thinking about ordering this because it is absolute rubbish.
5,Best Digestion Enzymes on the Market!,"I've tried many brands for many years, and nothing compares to this brand!Great price and great results! Highly Recommended."
3,Refreshing and Anointed,This is my 1st Israel and New Breed CD and I am hooked. It definitely won't be my last! He leads you in Praise and then right into Worship with such a heavy anointing!
5,I AM NOT FORGOTTEN!! PRAISE YOU JESUS!!,"My father died 3 years ago, I thought I was over my grief and my anger has gotten tripple since that time. I couldnt admitt it to myself or others the truth. Last night I vented my tears and anger in full to my eternal father who is ""I am"". I call god ""Daddy"" now, since my own daddy is in heaven. I heard this song on enter his gates through k.s.b.j fm, and remembered it. I had to get it, I woke up singing ""I am not forgotten, god knows my name!"" Praise you jesus for this artist, the song in itself is a strong reminder that god is the father to the fatherless, a mother to the motherless and he wont die and he wont forsake you..god I owe you my everything..anyone who reads this is asked to pray for my deliverance, becuase ""god knows my name!"" PRAISE THE LORD!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,A filler not a filler-upper,The best part of this new CD are the live performances of the older hits from New Season and Live From Another Level. The new tracks are weak and seem more like CD fillers than songs to make your praise.I recommend you buy Another Level rather than this one. It has been in my CD player since 2005 and doesn't look like that will change anytime soon.
5,Very annointed,"A very annointed and wonderful CD! I play it quietly at work to keep praise in the atmosphere. I play it at home to just come to worship. I bought a copy for myself and one for a friend who said the same thing. If you are looking for something that will take you to the throne, this is it!"
5,"Out of print, and really quite nice to listen to.","I haven't heard this music in perhaps 20-25 years, and this was a nice recording. I'm glad to own it. Now I have to get the movie too."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased two of these with several other items. They were dented and dinged due to apparent mishandling before packaged and lack of protection in the box for shipping. I had one replaced because the end was damaged beyond ability to use. The replacement came damaged also, but usable. I had waited 3 weeks from the time they were ordered and had to use what I had. It's a shame to use these items on a new building, even on the back side."
1,Pointless,"Brando is a great actor, but a terrible writer. In fact, I seriously doubt he is even that, since this book clearly comes across as having been dictated rather than actually composed at a keyboard or sheets of paper. Given Brando's tendency toward laziness later in life, that should come as no surprise. You will learn very little of interest about the man, and what you do learn will very likely lessen rather than amplify your opinion of him. If you actually want to know something about his life that at least attempts to be somewhat objective and offer some insight,Brando: The Biographyis a much better choice."
4,Stars for a star,This product is a gift so I am not in a postition to review it except to say that it is in good condition.
3,Marlon has an interesting view of his life.,"Marlon Brando had a very interesting early life and his recollections are very entertaining. Once he reaches fame, his view of what happened in his life, the sequence of these events and their importance becomes rather twisted. For example, he never once mentions his wives. Barely mentions his children, but is very concerned about civil rights. He's different and so is this book. Not a typical autobiography"
3,HinoSenshi's Opinion of Brando-san's Autobiography!,"I'm not under 13 but I don't have an e-mail address.This book was interesting because it made me feel as if I was actually inside the head of this great man and was actually there with him during the course of his life.Only one problem: CAN YOU SAY PERVERTED?!!!!Brando's minorly explicit descriptions of his sex life got on my nerves! He was a HUGE womanizer and he thought of everything in sexual terms; I got so annoyed that I had to put the book down. Don't get me wrong, Marlon Brando was a great actor(and really, really HOT!) but his personal life was a little bit to raunchy for me! Maybe you may like this book better than I did, but i know i won't read it again."
4,Not Just An Actor,"Brando was also a terrific storyteller. This book puts to rest so many rumors and gives an honest self-appraisal of this large and largely misunderstood genius. His life was filled with deepest tragedy, but Brando managed to stay positive and he kept his killer sense of humor. The book is funny! Brando was an actor, but also a humanitarian and a true friend to those without a voice. I encourage fans to hear his story from his own voice, rather than one of the many gossip-filled bios available."
3,Brando revealed.,"This book is an opportunity to ""hear"" Brando, in his own words, on his life and loves, his relationships with his siblings and parents. It sweeps away some of the mystery that surrounded him because he was portrayed by the media as reclusive and difficult. And perhaps he was BUT the book shows gentle humor and deep and abiding friendships as well as strong opinions that sometimes left jaws dropping. However, not may people are willing to put their reputation on the line for something they believe in. Brando was more than willing to be controversial to make a point."
5,A great tool to help one become less fearful of proofs,"I really wanted to learn about cryptography, but my math background is weak and I would always feel intimidated when confronted with a proof. Going through this book, doing the well-written exercises, and reading the solutions really helped me understand proofs better. Now I am not afraid to tackle an introductory cryptography book. I wish I read this book before college."
5,Great for CSET Test 1 preparation,"I purchased this book to prepare for the CSET Subtest 1 since I've had no preparation that I can recall in formal proof writing. I loved this book and it really made me wonder why I've never had to write proofs! In this book, you can go as deep as you would like, however, covering the first 2-3 chapters would be plenty for the CSET. I did in fact pass, and I attribute what I learned in this book as helping my score push me over to the ""pass"" side!Lots of examples and then the real works is when you try to do the proof yourself - which the author suggests will be worth it! I'm so excited to have found this book!"
3,Good explanations,"I give the explanations five stars, but I noticed lots of typos in the midst of proofs. I found myself scratching my head, thinking I was missing something, when it turned out that there was a greater-than sign when it should have been a less-than sign....or some similar error. They were clearly typos, but there are way too many. Also some of the truth tables in the sections called RELATED STATEMENTS are not the correct ones. I see that there is a newer edition, but I've already paid to rent this one for a couple of months, and I don't want to take a chance on more typos."
5,Great Book for the Transition into Proof based Math Classes!,"This book covers the different proof methods most commonly used in Mathematics writing, which is very helpful in the Junior and Senior level mathematics classes. It also has examples using each method. I loved this book and it is a very easy read. I highly suggest it for anyone that is going into any of the more proof based mathematics classes that hasn't had the experience of writing proofs."
1,Never got it,Don't order this toy simply because the retailer doesn't send it. And then doesn't respond to emails.
3,Not that excited,This is not the best Kingston Trio CD that I have. There are not very many songs on this one and I object to the metal case.
2,Very little content,"I was expecting more photos with at least a small description of the motels or their history.Yes, the photos included were of good quality but there was no real substance to the book.FYI - I own a 50's motel and was looking for decorating ideas, etc."
1,Eh.....save your money,This books isn't much and maybe the small size should have been a tip off. There are much better books on this genre. I would look elsewhere.
2,Not retro enough,"Should have been jammed packed with retro motel pictures so you feel like you're on a retro vacation, but seems like many pictures weren't even retro, and some didn't even belong in the book. Small book, thankfully very little writing. Author should use this as a primer to create a real treasure of a book in the future, a major collection of retro and doo-wop motels, and 50's vacation photos."
2,Broke after 1.5 years,"Cable no longer functioned after maybe 20 uses over 1.5 years. Retract feature is fine however, just the actual connecting capacity is lost."
1,Defective item received,"The size and shape matches the one I lost, though I cannot remember what brand that was. I pulled it out and used it the first time to debug a DSL problem, only to discover it was faulty. The connection link kept going up/down/up/down in a fast cycle. I scrounged for another, standard cable, and that worked. So this cable has some wiring fault.Amazon's return process is easy, and the faulty cable is on its way back. I'll update this review if the replacement cable works."
5,good product to eliminate cable clutter,I love this product because it eliminates cable clutter behind the tv. It also has a very good recoil function.
3,Tripp Lite retractable patch ethernet cable,"only 4feet in length, so unless your laptop has RJ45 port on the side your jack in the wall is, your are OK. otherwise just not long enough, you need 6 or 8 ft. Retracts nice, easy to packworks otherwise, 3/5 stars due to length"
5,Very dark and excellent,"These stories are among the most powerful I have ever read. In economical prose they show humanity at its worst but, unfortunately, a very realistic worst. The title story is of a man's cruelty to animals; it is the animals that show compassion. ""Dialith' in, Christaki"" tells of a mother, a foreigner abused within the family, and her love for her deformed son. In ""Ring the Bells"" a successful man retires to the village in which he was raised where he had rung the bells maniacally as a youth. ""Bonds"" is the story of love in a childless marriage - a story that is a bright spot in the generally bleak landscape of these stories. ""Walk On, Old Horse"" is the story of a political refugee returning home only to find no real home. The stories all are astute studies in human nature written in a manner that forces the reader to recognize the dark side of humanity. Not always enjoyable reading but so well done one can't set the book aside."
3,Looks like a xerox copy,What the hell is this? I opened up this thing in the store andnearly dropped my teeth. The is a PROFESSIONAL publication? I couldliterally take the original comics and do the same thing for about the same price. The only redeeming quality is the fact that the story is part of the main mythos. Why are they doing this to their work? . . .they ought to ask for a friggin'handout and be done with it. It's darn pathetic! Buy it if you want ot know what happens to Cutter and crew but PLEASE don't look at the originals first . . . it looks even worse then.
2,Mere punditry,"Liu was once a speech writer for the President - and sadly, it shows. His writing is beautiful, and he touches upon sensitive issues experienced by a great many Asian Americans, but utlimately, he offers no suggestions or resolution. Read this book like the poetry it is - but expect no brilliant insights."
2,Not my type of book,"I was required to read this book before I went to college. Although I read all of it, it just did not please me. I am not one for drama books (i.e. where nothing really ""happens"" in a book. By ""happens"", I mean any action or drama). There were a few parts in the book that had some good life lessons, but was it worth reading the whole book? No."
1,so lame,"Unfortunately I was forced to buy this fraud because of an Asian studies class curriculum. I thought this was totally cliche. I really could only see this being meaningful to an oblivious Hapa or sort of Asian mix who has no sense of self awareness, or has not been outside the house for that matter. LAME!"
4,Who Am I?,"For a young writer (28) who learned English as a second language, Mr. Liu's mastery of words excited my interest in his later writing.Additionally, I had the great good fortune to hear him speak at the University of Tennessee recently, when he was a guest at a Freshmen Gathering called 'Adventures of the Mind'. All in-coming freshmen were required to read this novel. He spoke of the students being 'second generation' people: away from their homeland, learning a new language (of college, the academic world), of making new friends, etc. Then he touched on opportunities; questioning one's own values; finding one's niche in the world... all themes in his book.I especially enjoyed THE ACCIDENTAL ASIAN, purchased through Amazon Books, and look forward to read more of Eric Liu's writing, now that he is in his forty's."
3,A banana makes cream pie,"In this book, Liu attempts to explain away his Chinese heritage and background by saying that just because he's learning from a whiteman, please don't call him white. He attempts to explain away his self-hatred for his Chineseness by saying that the reason he couldn't score chicks in high school was because he was in Chinese. He attempts to explain his marriage to a white woman by saying that he was in love when he plainly shows you that his marriage is in part an attempt to get back at all those white gilrs who scorned him back in high school. If it quacks like a duck and walks like a duck, it's a duck. Read this book if you want to see how far down the river a Chinaman can paddle in the vain attempt to be aceepted by white mainstream society."
5,Well-balanced questioning of middle-class Asian America.,"I certainly do not agree with all of Liu's opinions, but I would recommend this book to any person who is going through that unique experience which is Asian America. I also recommend this book to non-Asians who have an earnest interest in what being Asian in American can entail."
4,"Very informative and brings the truth of what is ""Asian-Am""","Defintely something I would want second and 1.5 generation Chinese American's to read. I certainly could relate to some of the things he feels, but definitely not all the things, such as Marrying a white woman, or even the comparison of Asian American's as the next Jews."
1,Incredibly irritating and self-indulgent memoir.,"Eric Liu presumes to represent all Asian Americans in this short sighted and pretentious memoir. However, he only represents himself, as most of the ""Asian American traits"" he writes about are simply reflections of his moderate middle class views and life.Liu seems to be trying to separate two parts of the Asian American identity: the Asian and American sides. Though is quick to defend himself after writing about Asian American issues and stereotypes, begging to clarify that he is not the same, he subsequently attempts to evoke ""sameness"" when asking other Asian Americans to see things from his viewpoint. I couldn't stand that he seemed to want to speak for all Asian Americans. His advice could have been left out, with only his history making up the bulk of the book, and it would have been interesting and insightful. Instead, it was borderline offensive. He needs to stop speaking for all Asian Americans and giving terrible advice."
2,skeptical of his intent,"How can Eric Liu simultaneously disavow his Asian heritage and at the same time try to profit from it by writing this ""provocative"" book? The irony was just a slap in the face! If it's not such a part of his identity, why title the book as such? I suppose he answered it by putting ""accidental"" in front of ""asian,"" but it also speaks to how race is still an issue and whether he wants to deal with it or not, he will be perceived as a racialized individual. I was not impressed by his story."
4,"Inexpensive, but Very Basic","This is a very inexpensive item that serves a useful purpose if you need to make fast insertion and removal of small mutes. Ideal for straight mutes, it will work for some cup mutes. It can even hold a water glass.Adjustment to fit the lip of the stand is the main shortcoming. It has a tight fit and wide fit option, and the typical black music stand is right in the middle, meaning, if you can't slide it down to a slightly curved end of the lip, it may come off the stand with the mute in it, rather than the mute come out. It is also possible that your mute will stick up enough to block part of the bottom line of your music. A bit picky, and you get used to and adjust to the shortcomings.A good item for amatures who don't want to spend a lot, but if you have more than one mute, a multi-mute holder that mounts on the stand post might be better, though that is a longer reach for a quick insertion."
2,Dragged Out,"When I purchased this book, I didn't realize it was part of an ongoing series. I might have better understood Victor and his relationship with his partner if I'd read previous books, though it didn't matter much with this story.On the positive side, the plot holds an intriguing mystery. Victor is a fun character who approaches life with dark humor, and doesn't always uphold the law as he should.On the negative side, for me, this book had too much dead space within the 499 pages. It could easily have been condensed down to 300 or so for a much more engaging story.The story started out strong, though it quickly became scattered and messy. There was a whole lot going on, yet there were also a whole lot of pages of nothingness. The characters here felt too much like people in an absurd sitcom. Everyone was excessively quirky and this made the entire story seem more like parody than a believable suspense novel.Overall, this one just didn't work for me."
3,okay lawyer mystery,"Another in the author's Victor Carl series. Here we find lawyer Victor waking up after a rough night out with a tattoo on his chest with a girl's name on it, trouble is he has no idea who she is or how it got there.....Victor is a bit of a mess, he wants to be a `player' but has not got a nasty enough streak to do it, so he lurches along wanting to make the jump to the big time, but some deep rooted morals keep him from the edge. In Marked Man, Victor is trying to re-unite a wanted man with his mother while trying to return a stolen painting. At the same time he is trying to find the girl whose name is on his chest and finds there may be a connection with his case.This is perfectly entertaining if a little uneven in pace, Victor is an entertaining lead character and the author also introduces some interesting peripheral ones. The plot is interesting enough although a couple of the twists were rather obvious. So while not one of the author's best, it's not bad."
5,Opens Your Eyes,This book is absolutely revolutionary! This book openned my eyes to some questions that have been bugging me for a long time. And I like the fact that this book is written in a very readable way -- difficult concepts were explained effectively. I feel like I have grown personally as the result of reading this book. I am sure that this book will remain one of the most influential books of all time for me. I highly recommend it!
2,Boring and hard to read..!!,"... The information was repetetive and unhelpful. The main advice in this book was to get a group of manufacturing, marketing, and patenting ""experts"" that would guide you through the whole process of product development ..!! The whole book keeps referring to these ""experts"" numerous times in almost all the chapters. I also didn't like the side quotes found on each page. They were distracting and offered no real useful information."
5,"""From Patent to Profit""","""From Patent to Profit"" by Bob DeMatteis stands out among all the books on the subject. Bob's book has literally become my guide from the patent stage to selling our product on the market. Bob is very knowledgeable. His own success with patents and product development helps him guide the beginner. He takes you step by step through the process in a very precise and understandable way. I am so pleased that I became involved with Bob's teachings early on in my journey to product development. I've purchased other books on the subject and 'From Patent to Profit"" says it best, especially for beginners."
2,Boring and hard to read..!!,"Do not buy this book.. The information was very repetetive and worthless. The main advice in this book was to get a group of manufacturing, marketing, and patenting ""experts"" that would guide you through the whole process of product development ..!! The whole book keeps referring to these ""experts"" numerous times in almost all the chapters. I also didn't like the side quotes found on each page. They were distracting and offered no real useful information."
4,Great Book - Bad product,"This is absolutely a great book full of candid and to the point answers. I would recommend it to anyone. However, the quality of the binding on this books is terrible. It fell apart in two days... pages actually fell out of the book. You will need a 3 hole punch and a 3"" folder to put it in."
4,Lots of helpful information.,"Just because you have a great idea, and spend $4,000 on patent design and lawyer paperwork, doesn't mean you will get a patent. Good information though."
3,Patents and Profit,"Having worked with intellectual property for many years, I was interested in seeing how individuals could profit from their inventions. The book presented a reasonable background on intellectual property in general, and provided some insight into the steps one could take to move from patent to profit."
5,It lives up to its name!,"From Patent to Profit is the first book anyone considering developing a new idea should buy. FPTP catapulted me right into licensing negotiations. It teaches who to talk to, how to talk to them, and how to protect yourself and your product. FPTP is very thorough yet easy to read. It takes you step-by-step from idea to profit. A priceless book!"
5,"On a scale of 1 to 5, I'd give it an 8. Great on inventing","The book is very easy to read, and it is very interesting. The author weaves in the need for patents and other intellectual property protection very well into the invention process. This is far better coverage on the strategy of patents than I have ever read before.But for me the best part was the overall process recommended by the author. He shows us how to have marketing and manufacturing concerns guide the invention process from the beginning. He also presents a very detailed analysis of how to go about inventing a product using the problems and concerns of the customer as a basis for your product. This, again, was very well done.The author has invented, and now teaches inventing. This book serves as his seminar material.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.John Dunbar"
1,read it with a grain of salt...,"I have heard Dr. Newman speak, and I can say that he seems to believe that only his approach to therapy will ""save the world."" He compares himself and his devoted following of patients to Jesus and the apostles. I would take anything he says with a HUGE grain of salt. These some good advice in here, for sure, but I feel ripped off and wouldn't want to put any more of my money in his pocket."
2,not the greatest one ever sung,"This CD isn""t the best of the Gathers. I was a little dissapointedon what I've heard.ThankyouLiza Roy"
2,I only got the GBA version of the game,like many other games before-the gba version of the game is bad comparing the the ps2/Xbox/Gamecube versions of the gamegba is the wackest console in the market
5,Deckle/Vicorian blade set,Yet another great and VERY easy exchange blades for the Carl trimmer making it very versatile and useful.
5,Love the purple,I have bought Shadowline long gowns for several years. I love the colorsthey are so comfortable and last for a long time. Own almost all the colors.THEY ARE WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL
1,Shadowline Nightgown,"Shadowline has been my favorite line of nightgowns for over 10 years. The fabric was silky, luxurious and opaque. I am past the age of peek-a-boo nighties. These gowns had a fabulous drape and substantial length to them. I like the way they slide with me when I turn over in bed without twisting up around me. They have washed well and lasted for these 10 yrs.....I have 4.I decided to buy another one in my favorite color, purple. Found this one, it was the right color, same style, same brand and comparable price to the ones I've had. When I received it, I noticed right away that the fabric was different. It looked and felt like a regular, cheap nylon nightie. It was shorter in length and see through, definitely not the same quality as my other gowns. Thank goodness I was able to return it with no hassle. Too bad Shadowline took the cheaper route. I would have been wiling to pay up for the quality to remain intact on this product."
5,For my sister.,I purchased this for my sister. She loves the gown and when I saw her wearing the gown she looked really pretty. Great quality and beautiful gown. This gown would have cost twice as much at a retail store in the mall. Thanks for the good deal.Susan.
3,Item received did not look like picture,"The gown is nice and of good quality, but it is light lavendar--not purple. It is also a short gown."
5,"Beautiful, soft, and comfortable","I bought matching long and short sleeved gown and robe, all in purple.They look nice on. My husband can't stop admiring me in them. He says I look like a princess (In size 2x yet). They are opaque. So I can answer the door and walk about.I always thought that cotton or flannel would be the most comfortable and that synthetic would cling or be sweaty. But the reviews were good so I took the chance.How wrong I was! They are comfortable and smooth as silk. They don't ride up or bunch up. I machine washed and dried them and they came out fine."
1,NOT WHAT IS PICTURED!,I ordered a purple nightgown that I thought would look just like the picture above but got a house coat looking gown......buttons from top to the bottom and sleeves are long. Definitely not like the picture! I would have sent it back but I threw away all the packaging and placed the folded gown in my drawer and was very disappointed when I pulled it out to wear. So I'm stuck with something I will never wear.....
5,Quality,"This gown is not only quality but comfort. Shadowline gowns have always been my choice of gowns. I love these gowns. If, which is very seldom the case, you have a problem the company stands behind them and quickly responds to making it right."
4,"Pretty color, comfortable, great style but .......","I love the Shadowline nightgowns because they're comfortable & the fabric is usually thicker than similar nightgowns by other manufacturers -- the only complaint I have about this one is that the fabric is lighter weight in this rich purple color -- the lighter colors use the thicker fabric and they should've used the same fabric for the purple -- the lighter the nylon fabric is, the more static-prone they are -- not so terrible, but an issue nonetheless."
4,nightgown,"this gown is very nice, and silky feeling, it is plenty long enough and a pretty color. It came in good time too, so I would purchase this product again in the future."
3,A bit disappointing,"I ordered this tape, hoping for some fine, clear speeches, which I could share with my grandchildren, but this was not all that great! There were some speeches, but the pictures were lousy. Only one showed him in color, but it seems so hard to get good copies of Malcolm X speeches and interviews.However, it did give some good information about Dr. Hale and other black people of the past, so it was okay, maybe good for school-children."
2,These are not 12 gallon bags,"These are mis-labeled as 12 gallon central vacuum bags. In reality, they are only about 1/2 as long as the 12 gallon size. They are the same diameter, however. So they will work in the vacuum but they are not the same size as the VM502 12 gallon bags."
3,Right but Wrong,"The bags fit the central vac bin diameter, but the length is way too big. the description by the seller is not detailed enough and should mention the length of bag. bag will work but not a perfect fit to my size bin."
3,keep vehicle clean,The mill on this roll seems much much thinner than the last roll I bought from another company but the price was triple this price. This is a great price and the plastic works decent enough considering what I paid for it. I'd buy it again.
5,Love this carpet protector,I bought this protector for a party at my house. I put it for a day in main hallways and it stick quite well. Others in party as well liked this product and may buy this for future use. I would definitely recommend this if you want to protect your carpet during party or during painting.The product came on time and in good condition.
4,helped me potty train a puppy,"I used this to protect an area where our new puppy had started pottying. Not only did it protect the carpet, but he didn't like the feel so it made training much easier!"
3,Hard to put on,"First of all, I'm disabled so many jobs are hard for me, but having said that, I think you really need 2 people to put this on correctly so it doesn't get all tangled up. You really have to give it a PULL to get it off the roll. With one person, if you do that, it releases the part already ""tacked"" down from the carpet and you have a mess. It does keep the carpet clean, once you get it down."
5,Perfect--and great bargain!,"This is great-it had everything I needed to take my cross-stitch stuff with me on vacation. I was even able to take it on the plane. It's a very neat, tidy little kit that keeps everything organized and conveniently comes with everything you need to get started for a lot less money than it would cost to buy everything seperately. It even fits a 7"" hoop if you put the adjustment side of the hoop between the rings of the binder. The color of the case looks black in the picture, but is actually a really nice dark blue. Love it."
3,A Deep and Heavy Drama,"This is the second play in Jones' A Texas Trilogy, and takes place in Bradleyville, West Texas. This three act play covers the life of Lu Ann, the title character. In Act One she is 17, in Act Two 27, and Act Three 37. In the opening scene we meet Lu Ann a young, spirited girl who dreams of leaving the small town and making something of herself. As the play continues we see many obstacles come her way- - such as a divorce, death, and an alcoholic family member. Lu Ann's spirit is eventually weakened and caves in. In this drama, the viewer is brought face to face with the struggles of failure in human life. The dramatic strength of the play is evident throughout, and therefore this play is a thought-provoking piece of art."
1,Dok,Ummmmmmmm......NO. Lasting cream is what its supposed to do but its more likeQuicker cream. Ruined a few moments so i will just do without.
2,Did not work for me,"I applied it as indicated on the packaging and it did nothing for me,it was so embarrassing. I searched the web and found something else its called Sexual Longevity for men it really works I was able to last about 30min and its natural, it's made from the sap of a plant in Asia. It does NOT NUMB but it gives this warm tingling sensation that makes you last longer in bed they even have free samples[...]"
4,not bad,"Not as potent as I expected but still effective, but I can't complain and I Would buy this product again."
4,Just the right amount of numbness,This is a pretty good product. It numbs you just enough. You will be able to last longer without being so numb that you dont enjoy the act. I highly recommend
2,Didn't do anything for me,"I did not notice any change. This product had good reviews so I bought 3 tubes of the stuff, maybe I need to wait longer after applying it or something. But it had no effect on me."
3,Worth another half star,"Mr. White worked with his medium wife Betty until (and purportedly after) her death in the early 20th century. He was a writer of western fiction and published many novels. He also published at least 7 spiritual works based upon input from Betty (according to the books). The initial book is quite good--""The Betty Book"" and highly recommended reading whether you accept the premise of its origin or not. The following work is a great classic of metaphysics--""The Unobstructed Universe."" The later volumes are based upon its cogent, logical, and convincing world view and are attempts, perhaps, to lead readers in applying resulting conclusions. Thus, this book has some wisdom, but it's not as pithy as the former two classic works. Other, similar spiritual works include: ""The Job of Living,"" ""Anchors to Windward,"" ""The Road I Know,"" and ""With Folded Wings."" I value White's spiritual works far more than the Seth books or Walsch's ""Conversations with God"" series."
4,Man I wish these nuts would get back together,How the H@ll do all you reviewers know of FDQ? They're from Landis NC.
2,Way Too Many Better Books To Read,"I read about a quarter of the way through...unless you're looking for detailed sexual episodes one upon another skip this book. There are far too many good books to be spending your time reading. This is very base, humorless, unimaginative and just plain boring, boring, boring."
4,Great read!!,"In preparation for a trip to Pulia I saw this title on the reading list from the travel company. Once I started this book it was very hard to put it down! The characters are so real and you really do care about them. Details of the Southern Italy area were very interesting. Also of interest were the recent historical details of political unrest, justice system and the prison system. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Italy as a travel destination!"
3,Enjoyable Fiction,Loved the fact that it was based in Italy. The family was a good depiction of the real thing. Liked the characters. Too predictable. Held my interest enough to finish the book. I would recommend reading.
4,delicious read,A wonderful fast paced novel that keeps moving and turning. I thought it was a great read. Equally as good as her first book.
2,A different reaction.,"In contrast to the previous reviewer, I found both Dr. Gladstone and her assistant Nancy very real and very enjoyable to read about. I couldn't figure out Constable Snow at all. I think his mysterious behavior was due only to the author's desire to place a hurdle in Dr. Gladstone's way, nothing more.As for the comment ""some of the characters behave in such strange manner that their reasons for doing so just beggar belief. Unfortunately I cannot really go into this without revealing plot spoilers)"", this is absolutely correct. I'd say read this for the characters, and give up on trying to make sense of the mystery."
2,Wasted Money,I can't think of anything I liked or disliked about this DVD. Nothing memorable occurred . I cannot honestly recommend this movie.
1,Misleading,This display all these celebrities on its cover but most of the well-known actors only appear as cameo. The story line went nowhere. Am not sure what was the message they were trying to convey. Disappointing.
5,Contradictions Of The Heart,"Item as just as seller listed. Provided fast ship. The plot was cool as well as the acting. I would watch it again in a few years. If I don't like a movie it gets sold. So this is a keeper, but wouldn't pay full price."
3,Wanted More!!,"It was a great start I wished I could have seen more of it! Overall I wasnt disappointed, but it seemed to be missing something.Maybe they should work on a PART II call it MORE Contradictions of the Heart?"
1,waste of time movie that's all over the place,"Watching this movie was a waste of time! It's all over the place. It starts with a group of guys getting together after 10 years and a couple of them are so irritating and unlikeable that it's hard not to turn it off within the first 10 minutes. I wish I had turned it off! Then it jumps into a group of women. I figured, okay, maybe these women are the counterparts of the ensemble of men I just endured. No, they weren't. Then, mercifully (and abruptly), it's over. I agree with the reviewers who said giving one star was generous because a bomb button would be so much more accurate!"
1,A Hot Mess,This movie was horrible.. Alot of good actors in it but you could not follow the movie at all ... it was all over the place. There should be a YOU MEAN REALLY? button..
2,More of the same (yawn),"I am probably rating this too high to begin with. I am seeing a lot of films lately that are very similar in plot (or so they try to be). Showing several different couples (people) with issues (relationship, etc) and then you have the one that has it together, etc, etc, etc. This one was not very funny, where it should have been and I really wasn't feeling the bar scenes. Just not very good. Ok though is you are desperate for something to watch."
5,Helping the execution problem,"My firm facilitates strategy planning for organizations. We help clients design great plans that were realistic yet for years I was disappointed with the lackluster results I would see when coming back for subsequent planning sessions. I began employing the methodology several years ago with tremendous results. Gary Harpst's methodology squarely attacks the execution problem with a sound, doable solution. Is it easy to be consistent on the execution side...no. Is it worthwhile and will it pay extraordinary rewards...absolutely!"
5,Awesome Read,"I was totally engrossed in this charming, funny, poignant and gripping story that I got very little sleep! I literally could not put it down as I anxiously waited for events to unfold. It touched on all of my emotions. Jacqueline truly outdid herself with this book!"
2,Customer Service is lacking,"BearPaw makes a decent shoe but the Clausette has customer service issues. The shoes had glue from the box on the tips of the toe, I asked for an exchange via email and got no response. I originally called but I got a recording saying they were swamped and were only taking emails. So I sent another email and still no response. I bought these shoes the first week of December. Cute shoes but buy them from Famous Footwear."
4,Not Your Ordinary Chess Book,"This is the kind of chess book one is likely either to love or hate; it simply doesn't leave room for an indifferent response. It either has the ring of truth and wit for the reader because the reader shares the beliefs and values of the book or it seems pretentious and overblown. I confess that I loved it. I enjoyed a chess book that didn't look like an algebra text and talked about ego, concentration, materialism and Groucho Marx. I thought there were creative ideas throughout the text. Talking to one's pieces, for example, struck me as helpful - usually I just curse their clumsiness. My good friend hated this book. He wanted prescriptions, checklists, and forced move variations. It is a matter of taste. I should add that all this psychological ""stuff"" might be less relevant if the reader often overlooks tactical ideas that net the opponent a piece or pawn. It's a luxury to worry about perfectionism or thinking too much when you're down a piece."
4,I'm not finished yet but liking it so far....,"This book might be harder to read if you don't have any college experience. It is written and reads just like a college text book but with some anecdotal stories. I would recommend it if you have experience reading books written by doctors, researchers, or college professors. Might be a little wordy for others...."
4,wonderful read,"Just a really wonderful read. The wording is often reminiscent of the period in time, and at first this takes a little getting used to. But after a spell, it flows nicely and replicates a feel for the era. Then your into the mystery; not far along and you find yourself invested in the story, needing to know the solution. If at some point you are thinking the answer is to obvious and are thinking of ditching: don't you dare. Hang on; the ride Bayard takes you on - it's more than worth it!"
4,Great Read!,"What a well-rounded, accomplished, visionary writer Mr. Bayard is! This is a top-notch book that also serves as a great introduction to Poe's work. (Look for the Poe allusions sprinkled throughout the text that serve as a fictional inspiration to some of Poe's best known work.) Plus, there is a great twist at the end that, honestly, I did not see coming. I can't wait to see what literary figure or character this tremendous author tackles next."
3,Rich language but a story sometimes gets boring,Excellent premise and interesting plot but sometimes the story gets convulted and boring. The language is rich and descriptions are quite colorful but dialogue often too long and misguided. The criminal ploy kept me reading and the ending was quite intriguing but if the book had 100 pages less and the story was more intense I would appreciate the book much more.
2,"Disappointing, but redemptive at the end","One would think getting a starred review meant the book was spellbinding, but I did not find that to be the case. The idea of Poe as a character was intriguing enough for me to read the book, and through much of it, the quality of the plot and dialog was top notch. Unfortunately, about 2/3 in, you could see which way the plot was going, and it was a disappointment to find a plot unfolding that was reminiscent of Cornwall or Patterson at their commercial worst. However, things turn around in the last 20 pages and the last 2 plot twists make slogging through the corny initial motives for the crime worthwhile, almost."
4,"If you have an ear for Poe, you'll like this book!","I've read a fair number of murder mysteries. I once enjoyed, but now am bored with PD James. The Pale Blue Eye is one of the few murder mysteries I've read where I wasn't able to figure out who the killer was until the very end. There's lots of Poe-esque writing in this book, which was also enjoyable for me, as a Poe admirer. The author really got the voice down. I also enjoyed the historic setting. So if you like historic murder mysteries, read this book! Most satisfying."
3,Not is best work.....,"I love this guy but this isn,t his finest work. Try ""As the Future Catches You"", a much more provocative and interesting read."
4,Slim but interesting,"This book contains five papers about four little-known Papuan peoples.The first describes the traditions and symbolism associated with marriage, pregnancy and child-birth among the Bauzi of the northern Lake Plains region.The 2nd and 3rd deal with the myths of the north coast Orya people, and the conflicts that arose in their culture now that they can no longer kill to prove manhood!The 4th introduces the world-view of the Iau living along the Rouffaer River, examining both the ""real"" and the spirit world.The 5th paper describes women's life among the Mpur who live in the north of the Bird's Head Peninsula.All papers were written by authors who spent years among these peoples gaining fluency in their languages."
3,Astrology for beginners,"After years of delightful enjoyment regularly following astrologyzone.com I was expecting a lot more from this book. The writing here is eloquent (as expected), but the subject matter is really at a very basic level. Although this would be a wonderful primer for anyone just graduating from reading their daily horoscope in the newspaper comics section, anyone with even slightly more knowledge about astrology will be bored to tears. This material has all been covered before in the many very good and very bad books already out there. Haven't we all already read Linda Goodman's Sun Signs??? I am sure that regular (or even new) readers of Miller's website will agree that her yearly and monthly updates there are far more informative than anything in this book. It would have been great to see a book that came from her offering the same level of complexity and nuance that makes her take on astrology at Astrology Zone so readable and addictive. Maybe in the next book?"
4,Better than anything on tv today,"While Here`s Lucy is not as good as her earlier shows like The Lucy Show, it is still very good. Much better than any of the gunk thatinfests tv today. Lucy is still paired with Gale Gordon. And those two had such a wonderful comedic chemistery together that they justcouldn`t help but be funny.And this season has guest appearances by some of the truely outstanding comedians of the time like Jack Benny, Carol Burnett, andSammy Davis Jr.It`s not one the outstanding comedies of all time, but it is very, very good. Watch it and remember the good old days when tv comedieswere actually funny."
1,Last days of which Covenant?,"I have read this book, and find that the most important question was not asked by the author.. that question in whether the 'last days' of the New Testament were the last day of the New Covenant, or the Old? Numerous passages make it plain that the Old Covenant was coming to an end (Heb. 8:13), to be replaced with the everlasting New Covenant. The Preterist view (use a search engine) properly addresses this question, and shows why the passing of the Old Covenant was the creation of a New Heavens and earth (Heb 12:25-29)."
1,This in NOT original Giovanni music,"DiAngelo did not start Giovanni's career and has nothing to do with Giovanni or his music. This is a re-mixed version of Giovanni's original Promises cd and is not licensed. If you are a Giovanni fan, buy only original Giovanni cds made by NewCastle Records. Not some cheap re-mix that is being offered here."
4,Works fine in my vacuum,"I purchased these vacuum bags because I can no longer find them in stores. They fit and work just as well as the Honeywell brand that I had been using and cost quite a bit less. The pack of three vacuum bags does NOT include a filter, like the Honeywell brand does."
2,those sweeper bags,they say that they should fit the CN1 canister sweeper but the bags were too small we ordered the Honeywell sweeper bags later and they were the right sweeper bags.
2,dosnt even attract!,sure it works.WOW. not! my 2 cats wilbert and sophie leave the computer in 5 minutes. besides my computer is on top of a desk and my kittens will fall. im supposed to let my kittens be entertained. their not. its lousy but i have to say it has great realistic 3-d that i enjoy. but i hardly recomond you get it for yourself if you enjoy fish.at least my real fish stares at it day and night its like they have 3-d friends! not for cats or dogs. only for you and or your fish. hope i helpedOH i bet your thinking its just Y kittens who dont like it well your WRONG my friend brought her dog and cat over so we couid see if it work and NONE of the animals took enjoyment out of it.DUH an animal wont be intrested in fish it wants to break my pc to eat them.LOSERS who made this for cats its for FISH.DUH
3,The book is HUGE,"I was looking forward to receiving this single volume collection of Conrad's, but it is HUGE! It is bigger than Strongs Concordance! This makes for uncomfortable reading. The two positives are that I will be able to read Conrad and build my arm muscles up at the same time. Seriously, they should have made this a two-volume set."
5,A must read for all Christians and Catholics,"Are Catholics trying to work their way into heaven? Why seven sacraments? Why make so much of Mary? Why confess to a priest?This book answers it all....and in language that ordinary people can understand. If you've ever had questions about what your Catholic neighbour believes, get this book. If your Catholic teenager has questions about his faith, buy him this book. If you believe that all Catholics are going to hell, buy this book. It may not change your mind, but should give you something to think about!"
2,Poor Quality.,Bought this for my sister who loves this comedy team. The picture begins very poorly then clears up as it goes along but still not to the point where it's great clarity.
2,"Good at first, but after using for awhile... not so happy","I did a good amount of research before buying this camera. Some of the pluses include a large LCD screen, compact size, relatively easy to use. But, after using it for a few months, I am disappointed with a few things. First off, the delay when taking a picture is often terribly long... so you often lose your subject, especially when trying to photograph kids! Even in sport mode and burst mode this is an issue. Perhaps I have just not found the right setting, but the Canon I owned before this Olympus, was a cheaper camera, but when you pushed the button it took the picture with almost now delay. Another complaint is that is does not come with a battery pack.... you instead have to use AA (which seem to die in minutes) or rechargables that don't last much longer. It seems everytime I pick the camera up the batteries are dead or near dead. VERY ANNOYING. I am selling mine on Ebay."
2,How do you work this thing?,What's with the flash delay? I'm beginning to think it's a little too advanced for me. All I want is for the flash to go off when I hit the shutter button. Any suggestions on a simple setting? My cats won't sit long enough to get a picture.
5,A Treasure!,"I enjoyed this book as a child in the early 70s, then rediscovered it as an art student in college. The watercolor illustrations are simply fantastic, and there is no mention of who the artist is. The story is told in an interesting mix of paragraph prose narration and script format dialog."
5,Tight fit but great price,"This shock mount is a tight fit for my AKG C-414 but you can't argue with the price -- almost a hundred bucks cheaper than the official AKG shock mount. Hopefully it will loosen up a bit over time. You have to plug in the mic cable before mounting the mic, and the adjustment knobs are made of plastic, but I still think it's a great deal."
4,SPSK B Series Mic Shock Mount,This device is well designed though the suspension is a bit stiff as delivered. I found that true low frequency shock and vibration isolation was best achieved by unhooking some of the mounting points and loosening the suspension. Perfect fit for my AKG C414B/ULS.
4,I didn't get all the stuff that was supposed to be included,"I didn't receive the two donut boxes, the headphones, the dance floor, and the disco ball. The only thing that was included was the donut counter and the doll. Did anyone else receive this stuff in their box? Or are they just lying about what's included?"
4,Entertains my son,My son is 17 months old and he likes to play with it.But it does not perform as described.I paid less than $6 for the toy and for the price it is good.
3,Recommended by a Friend - Very Unique,"Not a simple book to read, but has soime unique thoughts. Need to have a rather detaile interest in math to enjoy or follow."
2,Terrible taste but has iron,"If your child will not eat the Flintstones vitamins because of taste, then do not waste your money and do not bother with these. The taste is terrible. They do have 1/3 of your child's daily value of iron, but that's it. I can hardly stomach these as an adult. The taste is that bad."
3,My Kids don't like it,"Though I know this is a good vitamin, the taste is not so good. My 2 children absolutely HATE it, my 8 years old threw up the other day while taking it because he can't stand the taste.That being said, I tried it myself, and it honestly is not that bad. I think it is a hit or miss with children, you never know. Anyway, I advise you go with a smaller container first, until you are sure. I made the mistake of buying the bigger containers, and now I am stuck with 2 large containers that I will probably never use."
5,Great price,"I can only find these vitamins at Whole Foods, so this price for 120 vitamins is great! My child loves the star shape and has no problem chewing them. This is a really good deal!"
3,DO NOT TAKE IF YOU ARE ON ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES,"I was totally in love with this vitamin, it did not upset my stomach and had lots of folic acid, and I loved that it had digestive enzymes. I was taking it for about two months, when today I found out some interesting news.The ""Red Clover Extract"" I found out today you are not supposed to mix with oral contraceptives. I will not be taking this product anymore and am really hoping that it does not cause me to become pregnant. There has been research on Red Clover interacting with oral contraceptives, see drugdigest.org and check your contraceptive with the herbs in this vitamin to see if it might interact. They should really put a warning on the bottle."
4,Easier to swallow than the Just Once pills,"I finished a whole bottle of the Rainbow Light Just Once Prenatals and decided to try these petite ones b/c every so often I would have trouble swallowing the gigantic pill. I like this brand a lot even though it tastes kinda gross. I pop it in my mouth and immediately drink water to help it go down, but I can still taste the vitamin. I'm not pregnant yet so I can't say anything about whether it will make me nauseous, but so far so good. These pills come out costing more than the Just Once pills but not gagging on the huge pill is worth it for me."
3,Still Makes My Stomach Sick!,"I had bought this product because I had read lots of reviews on how gentle it was on your stomach, and I have bought other products from the same brand before so I decided to try their multivitamin. It has everything you need and more in it, but unfortunately just like every multivitamin I have ever bought, aside from chewable chocolate ones, it makes my stomach sick, so unless I take it with food, I am in for a not-so-good time...If you are buying this multivitamin because it is supposed to be easy on your stomach, you probably should look at another alternative, but if taking it with food is not an issue for you, this multivitamin is great in what it has to offer!"
5,Great Prenatal!,These are great prenatals. They do not upset my stomache. The dose if 4 capsules daily so it allows you to take as little or as much of the product as you want up to the full daily dose. I switched to these because my old prenatal was constipating me. This one does not constipate me and actually seems to help with a movement. After about a week of switching to this prenatal i started to have regular movemements again. I have been taking two per day and supplementing just with a folic acid and a fish oil capsule for DHA and omega 3's. Great product. You can feel good about taking it too as it's organic.
2,Not for me,"These pills are quite large and I'm a petite person. I used to only take half a pill and only every other day. Each time I took one of these vitamins, I got some minor unpleasant side effects. There are many vitamins, minerals, and herbs in this supplement but I actually didn't research each one in detail prior to buying - I wouldn't be able to say which one I am reacting to. I've since stopped taking them and given them to a friend to finish since I didn't want them to go to waste."
3,Be cautious if taking with birth control,"I never actually used this product, and I am sure it works great after reading all the positive customer reviews. I gave it 3 stars just because I received it so quickly. I received this product and realized that there is Red Clover and Dong Chai in these vitamins. These two ingredients make birth control less effective, which is why I did not use them. Just a heads up to all the ladies on Birth Control and considering taking vitamins with these ingredients in them. Make sure you use an extra form of protection if already taking these!"
1,"Gummies came all melted together, like they were boiled","Be aware buying from this product from this seller! I didn't open the product till 3 months after purchase and found that all gummies were melted on the side of the bottle! They were either stored this way or transported, but now it is a homogenous mass glued to the side wall of the bottle. It clearly came this way, as I stored the bottle in a vertical position in a cool place."
2,smells bad and tastes nasty,"I have been using the rainbow light just once multivitamins for years. They come in several formulations and sometimes they reconfigure the ingredients. I don't know what they did this time but the smell and the taste of the tablets gross me out. I can't ever remember a supplement in either tablet or capsule form having any significant smell or taste. But this one stinks. I don't expect supplements to be tasty. I'll keep using them. But I won't buy them again.I can't speak to how well they work. Who knows how well any multivitamin works? I can't tell. I know people who claim they can. Every time they try something new they ""feel so much better"". If you ""feel so much better"", repeatedly, wouldn't you eventually be unable to feel any better?"
2,"Prenatal Petites, never again","These vitamins probably do what I need them to do. They are small enough to easily swallow, fill me up with good stuff to help my body be ready for a bebe, but the taste. THE TASTE!!! It took me a few days of thinking about it, but I have realized these vitamins taste just like the fertilizer and weed killer/ bug spray aisle smells at the store. No thanks. I will be looking for a replacement for these vitamins when i kill this bottle."
2,Kids won't eat them...taste like chalk,"I am reviewing the children's chewables multivitamins. I'm sure they are generally good for the kids, but that doesn't help if they won't eat them. I have tried them myself...they taste awful. My kids took them for a few days and now refuse. I don't know why anyone would like these. If you are the type of parent that forces their kids to eat vitamins you should probably buy these, but if you actually listen to your kids like we do I would not buy these. I'm still searching for something healthy and that tastes good."
2,Bad reaction,"I take the rainbow light prenatal and I really like it, so I thought I would try these for my four year old. I was a bit worried she would not like the taste, which she does not. But I get her to eat it with her Omega gummy vitamin and she is able to tolerate it. But ever since we started with these vitamins, she has had very painful gas to the point of screaming in pain. I was very worried when she started these symptoms, but can only conclude they are the result of these vitamins. Nothing else in her diet had changed. I really wanted to love these vitamins, but they just do not settle well with my daughter. Plus the fact I could only get her to eat one a day, so she never recieved the full does of two for a four year old. Has anyone else expirenced this? Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Rainbow vitamins, but not for my child."
3,I love rainbow light brand.,"The above statement being said, I think this particular vitamin needs to be condensed into a one-a-day. Taking six pills just for vitamin use per day seems excessive and hard to maintain."
1,They are horrible,"I bought these for my 9 year old son. Upon arrival they looked cute, but when I gave it to them, he absolutely hated them. Every day I have to force him to take them so when they are done I can try another kind. They are very very large and you have to take 2. To me it is like taking Tums. Sorry, these are a thumbs down."
3,Food coloring,These vitamins may be ok but I can't stand my yearn turning a deep yellow. They must have a food coloring in it to make it like this. It will actually stain underwear.
1,Warning: Contains Ginseng!!!,"I was really liking these vitamins and took them while trying to conceive and for the first month of my pregnancy. Then I read somewhere that Ginseng is a no-no while pregnant and there is 400 mg of American ginseng powder in this product (I found out amounts from the company). Ginsenosides, found in ginseng, are compounds considered potentially unsafe during pregnancy and especially shouldn't be taken during the first trimester due to birth defect concerns.Needless to say I was completely freaked out and stopped taking these immediately. I contacted the company, but they couldn't really allay my fears about safety of this ingredient. I blame myself for not scrutinizing the label before taking or discussing with my doctor.It seems like other people have had success with these and their children have fared just fine. But In my opinion, there's no reason to take something that could cause this much worry."
3,Very big pills,"I bought this item because I want to start taking care of the vitamins I'm going to need at my age.I found these pills too big, the smell is very strong and you have to take 4 pills daily, wich was something I didn't expect.I'm not going to buy another bottle again."
3,Great multivitamin but our kids don't like the taste...,"I think that this is a great comprehensive multivitamin, far better than the gummies. While I don't mind the taste, our children don't care for it at all but choke them down."
2,Giant pill!,"I was happy to only be taking these once a day. Buy I can't get this thing down my throat! I gag on it every day! Am three away drom finishing my first bottle, am going for the pettite bottle. I would rather take them three times a day than gag everyday. I don't mind the smell, just the size."
5,perfect prenatals!,"These vitamins are perfect. They're vegan, organic, whole food derived And gentle on my tummy. What better way to nurture myself and my baby?"
4,"truly petite, but serving is 3","Plus... These are the perfect size. I have used this brand before and loved it but I am excited to have found the petite.Minus... Only downsize is that you have to take 3 per day, but it is totally worth it because it absorbs better to take one with each meal anyway. Also, drink your milk because these don't have a full daily value of Calcium. Reason being that it is the calcium that makes most vitamins huge to begin with. It is a very large mineral. Could be coated better for easier swallowing but they are so small to begin with that this isn't much of a complaint.Ps... Even if you were to only take one per day it is still better than not taking a vitamin at all!!"
5,Super Vitamins!!,"These are the best vitamins, they really break down in your body. My stamina is much better, have recommended them to family and friends and told them to get them on Amazon because the price is much cheaper than anywhere else and the S&H;is FREE!! the S&H; is Super Fast!! Have bought for two of my sisters as well.."
5,Best tasted vitamin D gummy!,"We've been taking this vitamin D gummy for couple years now. The kids and my picky husband never complain about this one. Tastes really good, and you can trust Rainbow Light quality."
4,NO Soy! Yeah!,I believe this is the way to go if you are trying to avoid soy lecithen. Their regular vitamins and even their Vit C contains soy lecithin.
3,4 capsules per dose?!,"I had been taking the regular Rainbow Light pre-natal multivitamin and have not noticed any difference in my body since switching to this except that my pee is multivitamin neon yellow which I don't remember it being with the regular rainbow light ones. Too much infomation there? :-)Basically, I am not super happy about these because a dose is 4 large capsules vs the regular RL pre-natal multi which is one tablet. Considering these are to be taken during pregnancy, when a lot of women experience nausea, I think 4 capsules is too many, plus any others you might be taking like Calcium. Of course you can spread them out across the day but I am too busy for that.On the positive side there is no after taste and I like the organic-ness."
1,Ginseng in this prenatal.,I was taking the Rainbow Light Prenatal Organic Multivitamin.I'm very upset to share that it has American ginseng in it.WHY would a prenatal have this in it?It is unsafe for pregnancy!I wish I didn't take this! I am 10 weeks pregnant and off to find a new prenatal. I really hope this had no effect on my unborn child.
5,I feel much better!,"Since I started taking these vitamins I feel so much better, more alert etc...I highly recommend this product. Easy to swallow."
3,Have to take 4 pills per day!,"I'm lucky if I remember to take this twice a day, let alone 4!! I probably will not purchase it again for this reason."
3,NOT very small pills,They are not mini! They are about the same size as regular vitamins. I originally bought these in hopes they would be small and easy to swallow but they are larger and not coated so they go down a bit rough. I ended up giving them away to a friend.
2,Gross,"The one positive is that my 4-year-old liked the flavor of these things. I tried one and thought they were disgusting, but that's neither here nor there. The disappointment was that after about a month and a half, the vitamins all got gross-looking green spots all over them. It just didn't look healthy. Going gummy from now on."
2,Would not recommend,"I discontinued taking my regular woman's one-a-day in exchange for this product.After a week of using Rainbow Light, I had to quit and switch back to my other vitamin. I found myself to be very tired and it made my pee smell very bad. Unfortunately, I am stuck with two bottles of these vitamins and will not be taking them."
3,Tart Aftertaste,I purchased these for my grandchildren since my husband and I really like the adult vitamins by Rainbow Light. The kids dutifully took the vitamins but did not like the taste. Will not purchase again.
2,"Great vitamins, not so great taste","These are very good vitamins from a good company, but the taste needs some work. Even my very UN-picky 10yo says they are nasty and my 3yo refuses to take them."
1,Beware! Worst Whole Food multi on the market. HIGH MERCURY!!!!,"A lot of people like Rainbow Light because it's an all natural whole food multi, so they generally feel a difference when taking it compared to something synthetic, such as Centrum, 1 A Day and others, even some claiming to be ""all natural"". They don't cost too much more than the synthetics. Whole food multi's are always better than synthetics. However, I have taken many whole food multis, and by far the best is the Vitamin Code line by Garden of Life. I was wondering how this could be, since the daily values on RL is higher in a lot of the vitamins, and they both claim to be from whole foods. Well, turns out, Rainbow Light has been shown to have high mercury levels. Mercury is toxic and extremely difficult to get out of your system once it's in there, and can cause (or contribute to) a wide variety of illnesses. Stay away from this multi especially if you are pregnant!!!"
3,like anything else,"just average multi vitamins. haven't noticed any big changes. i did have some energy boost first few days, but then that little kick went away. not sure if i would ever buy it again."
3,It's ok,I switched to this multivitamin from New Chapter Women's Multivitamin. I noticed my nails are not as strong and I don't feel like I have as much energy. This one you have to take two vitamins twice a day. I am going to switch back to the other one when this one is out.
3,SMELLS horrible_tastes WORSE_HUGE size,"It's too soon to tell whether or not these food based multivitamins are doing me any good or not_ but what i can speak too is the way big size of the pill and the horrible smell and taste it has.-it's 1 inch long. about 1/4 inch wide. and approx 1/8 inch thick.- i don't know how to describe the smell and taste other than it wants to make me gag- the taste is worse than the smell- and it's so huge you've gotta set it on your tongue b4 your swallow with water- it's not the size you can just toss in and drink, you've got to set it on your tongue__and it says you should take 4 per day- 1 a day is all i can stand.-I also ordered the ""Men's One"" multivitamin and it also is large, smells horrible and tastes horrible.....had i known they would taste and smell so bad i would have looked elsewhere for a different brand."
4,Great for the kids!,Love these for the kids but they do take time to get used to. The taste isn't that great but they learn to deal and take it with a fruit flavored probiotic so its all good. Great price and fast shipping.
4,Amazing multivitamin unless you suffer from headaches,I love these pills and everything that is in them but apparently something in it is a trigger for my migraines. I do have a history of migraines but they are greatly intensified while taking these. I've been taking them on and off for 3 weeks now and when i have a major migraine i stop them and they go away then i wait a few days and try them again and my headaches start back up and are super severe. I was really hoping it wasn't this multivitamin causing it but after 3 attempts I give up.I really do think they have great ingredients though and for anybody that doesn't suffer from migraines this is probably the best pill out there for you.
4,Best deal,This is the best deal I could find for my prenatal petite .I used to purchase the same product for double the price from whole foods and vitamin shoppe .The image on the main page of this product is not that of prenatal petite which can be confusing! So i called up the customer service and they were prompt to answer that once you add the item to the cart it changes .Thanks for the amazing price.
5,Great Vitamin,"We have been using this vitamin for almost a year now. The first purchase came from a natural /organic chain store in our area and was much more pricey for a smaller bottle(60 Tabs). I was thrilled to find a larger quantity bottle(120 Tabs) on Amazon for the same price as the store's smaller quantity bottle! The larger quantity is great for us having three boys. We have an eight year old and four year old twins and all of them love these vitamins. Nothing artificial so I can feel good about them AND the digestive enzymes are a huge plus! All in all, these vitamins beat out all the others we have tried over the years hands down!"
5,Better than what is in the stores,"I love these vitamins. For years I have been taking Centrum and One a day w/o really feeling the effects of them. Then after reading The Natural Cures I learned that most of the vitamins on the shelf are synthetic and you don't absorb them. I choose this one b/c although it wasn't organic like he recommended it was all natural. The first day I tool these I felt a huge difference. W/i a week I was more alert, had more energy, better memory and no menstrual pains. I have recommended this vitamin to all my friends. I love it!"
4,Best Vitamin Ever!!,The only reason why i gave this 4 stars is because of the after taste. Other than that i absolutely love!!! I suffer from horrible menstrual cramps and because of the reviews i read about this vitamin helping with that i decided to try it. Omg!! I know longer have cramps and i also have energy on my period days as oppose to being fatigued and sluggish. I highly recommend it!!
5,Great Vitamin,"I have terrible morning sickness when I am pregnant and this was one of the only vitamins I could stomach. I felt great when I was taking it and noticed if I missed a day. My health has been fantastic and I continue taking these vitamins while breastfeeding. I have had two happy healthy babies! Note that you have to take four capsules once a day, if that is too much for you and you don't mind a few less nutrients Rainbow Light also makes a prenatal one a day that is great also."
3,Taste didn't win my children.,"The tablets are start shapes, which got my 7 year old daughter exited initially, but she didn't like the taste at all. I had my 3 year old toddler boy try it. Well, another failure. He spitted it out after about 3 seconds of sucking. I trust the brand since my family has consumed this brand for over a decade. Too bad, this one didn't work for my children."
4,"Good vitamins, easy on my stomach.","I have been taking vitamins for about 3 months and they seem great so far. I only take them every few days so as to not overdo some of my intake. They smell, and are very large, but I have no problem swallowing them. They are also not hard on my stomach as long as i take them with a small meal and lots of water. The only thing I would like is for them to have more Biotin and calcium, which some multi-vitamins have higher concentrations of. All in all, they are a great price and a great vitamin."
5,surprisingly good,"Doctor suggested that I should take Vitamin D during pregnancy and 1000IU. This was rated above 4 so bought it and I liked it. It tastes good, don't have to keep in mouth for long time to dissolve. Feels like I should one more but I don't :) Like the lemon taste. Overall nice deal and seems effective."
4,So Far So Good,"I have been taking this product for about three weeks now on the advice of my maid of honor after I said I wanted to grow my hair longer for my fall wedding and keep it healthy in the process. She started taking these last fall and said her hair and nails started to grow like crazy. Three weeks in and my hair is just about an inch longer and looks and feels healthier. My skin also looks a lot better and my moderate acne has healed considerably. I like that it is high in folic acid and doesn't bother my stomach if taken with a meal.I only have two problems with this vitamin. 1. The size of the pill and 2. The amount of calcium it contains. I take an additional calcium supplement but even if I break the pill in half, I still have a hard time swallowing it. Multi-vitamins usually have a horrible taste and this is no different. But I'm willing to gag once a day for it's benefits."
3,serving size = 4 capsules,"One of the reviewers said you only have to take 1 capsule a day, so i purchased this product thinking it would be the most cost effective, lasting 4 months! Turns out the serving size is 4 capsules, so it will only last you one month!Be advised!"
3,Serving size not mentioned until purchase,Prenatal petite 180 pills. Serving Size is 3 pills daily. I expected with 180 pills that it would be a 5-6 month supply instead of a 2 month supply. Please review before purchase. Satisfied otherwise.
5,A great multivitamin,I love this multivitamin. I was so happy to find something that was organic. The only downside is that one serving is four capsules.
1,Too Bad,"I was looking forward to trying these vitamins, but when my package arrived I found to my dismay that the gummies had all melted together into a giant blob in the bottle.I did manage to pull a chunk of melted gummy vitamin from the ""blob"" and give it a taste. I can only say that it tasted bitter. It wasn't a repulsive taste, and I could have dealt with it, but it wasn't my favorite flavor by far.My overall experience with this product is simply too bad. I may give it another try when I can get my hands on a fresh container of it. Though I don't think I will try to order this through the mail again."
2,One of my kids spit it out,"My daughter and I didn't like it. My 3 year old at first was mmmm (becuase initially it's sweet), but spit it out and cried for a drink. I decided to eat one (duh, why didn't I try it first), and thought it was sweet, but then gritty and had an aftertaste that I found not that great.On the other hand, my 3 year old son and husband each ate one and thought they were okay. My husband did say it was kinda gritty too."
3,Pricy + inconvenient,I rate this product with 3 stars basically because the daily recommended dose is 2-4 capsules which makes this product:1. Pricy: if you take the max amount/day this lasts only for 30 days for $20!2. Inconvenient to use: as taking 4 (or even 2) large capsules at once just feels too much of vitamin and spreading the 4 capsules over the day just doesn't work with the kind of busy life I have - one dose of vitamin is the optimal for me
1,Ascorbic Acid is NOT Vitamin C.,"I was looking for a PLANT-BASED Vitamin C for my kids. The only one I've found is Nutrilite. But my kids don't like the taste and won't take them. I thought Rainbow Lite would be the solution as they claim organics and natural plant based vitamins. However, I had to go to their website since the product info is lacking here at Amazon. And sure enough, Rainbow Lite uses Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) for their kids vitamins AND their Super C vitamins. Do your research folks - Ascorbic Acid is NOT Vitamin C and in numerous lab tests does NOTHING for your immune system. I'll continue my search."
2,Rainbow Light Womans One,"These vitamins are ok but i don't feel any extra energy as promised. Its nice that you don't have to take them with food, but I don't see ay major benefits yet. I've been taking them for three weeks now"
4,Gentle on the stomach,"So far, I am a huge fan of these vitamins. I have a very sensitive stomach and had tried so many other vitamins but they would all cause an upset stomach. I have been taking these vitamins daily for the past three weeks and have not once experience any upsets (I take all vitamins with food). I read an article in Reader's Digest a few years ago that said a test to a good vitamin is if it fully disolves in water becuase this way you know your body will be able to break it down and absorb the nutrients. I did the water soluable test with this vitamin and it passed! The women's one-a-day's never fully dissolved even after leaving it in water over night. I would recommend these vitamins!"
1,Itchy Disaster,"I had a bad skin reaction to these vitamins. I really wanted to love them, but I was an itchy mess after taking these for about a week (twice daily). I broke out in itchy hives on my legs and arms. My dermatologist (and common sense) suggested I stop taking them. Thankfully, the itching stopped shortly thereafter!"
2,Not much at all,It is a good TV program and misleading DVD as some rehearsals of popular tunes provided instead full length songs advertised on a jacket.A doco is of interest to deep funs and interested in rock history mostly.
1,Rip Off,"This is complete rip off. Metallica nor their music are present in this DVD. Just a bunch of fat, old, rockers talking about Metallica."
