1,Poorly written / directed movie,"Plenty of swearing, light on plot. Don't waste your time on this one, folks. I keep up with most of the new movies that come out and this one is a complete BOMB! Please don't waste your money..."
1,"slow, awful, waste of time","Cliched, boring and slow. They didnt show the real ending until after the credits, which I had to find out about from a friend because I shut if off as soon as the screen went black. If you watched the preview, you saw everything you need to know. Superhuman wolves that somehow were always there at every turn. I guess they were an allegory for death but even then it was a shallow allegory. Be productive with your time and dont watch this movie!"
1,So very bad.,"Almost walked out of the theater. Movie was so bad. Acting was poor. Plot, terrible. Ending the worst. Don't waste your time."
1,Weak,the filming was done well...but it was a total waste of time. The movie was almost as bad as castaway.
1,Bad on all Counts...,"It hurts to give such a negative review about a film with my favorite actor. Unfortunately Liam had to know after reading the script that this was a film being created that would only be a win for him. So often this happens with actors who have achieved great success that they begin to lower their standards for the right film, the right script. This was one of the poorest films I have ever seen. The 'F' word used in every sentence and sometimes multiple times, only because the writer could not do a better job. The realism of their plight was lacking, some of the wolves looked fake, all in all I would like my money back. I'll watch 'Taken' again and remind myself that Liam Neeson is still a great actor, however in the future will not buy one of his films without seeing some of the reviews."
1,One of the worst and most depressing movies ever,"Do not waste your money, this film is truly horrible, there is no redeeming factor to it at all, just a horrid, hopeless film with a terrible story and zero purpose."
2,Trash,"This could have been a good movie if it were not for the way over the top, of pouring out of filthy language"
1,What a pointless horrible movie,"A paycheck for Liam Neeson ... but a waste of time for viewers.There's no real plot except to make Liam Neeson look like ""the man"".He knows it all, he will beat up anyone who does not see thing the same way he does.And then some kind of mystical connection to nature and the wolves ... he haswhy ... from shooting them.Not point to this, no reason to see it ... no wonder it popped up on NetFlix for free."
4,Excellent movie,"I love Liam Neeson. However, this movie is not for the faint-hearted. It will scare the pants off of you!"
2,"The Grey, depressing","Ok story,The Grey wasn't what I thought it would be,disapointed. I usually really like Liam Neesom films. Kept waiting for something to happen. Enough depressing things in the world, don't need to watch a movie that is depressing too!"
5,good quality,cool movie if you like the typical liam neeson action style movie. this incorporated some nice action with survival etc
1,2 hrs of my life I wish I could have back!,"Horrible movie! Don't waste your time and money! The only goog thing is that I PAID to see 'Chronicle', which is a lot better then expected and I'm looking forward to watching Chronicle again. After that movie, I thought I would see another movie... 2 for the price of 1. However, I should have just left the theater. The Grey sucks! I wasn't the only one in the theater who was pissed, and booing after. The ending, or lack of, made The Grey 100 times worse! boooo!!!"
1,Not worth seeing!,"When I saw Liam was starring in this movie, I was so excited.Terrible reference to God.. Movie had you on edge no doubt..very disappointing ending!"
2,terribly exciting...eh...just terrible,"Watched this through Amazon's movie rental feature from my ps3 and the quality was absolutely terrible. The movie was also terrible too. The only reason it gets 2 stars is Liam Neeson has an accent and voice like Morgan Freeman. it doesn't matter what kind of movie they're in, they always make their roles enjoyable."
2,Disappointed,This sounded like a good movie and I actually enjoyed it until the ending. The ending ruined the entire movie for me. I would not recommend it to anyone.
2,The Gray,I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I am sorry to say that I was disappointed. There was some good scary moments but I did not like the ending. I think it could have been made better. I am glad that I did not spend the money at the movies.
3,"Slow, but interesting","A good single watch - don't absolutely regret watching it, but not rushing to see it again. The story is difficult to follow, so you watch it knowing the basic plot of: the plane crashed, they need to find a way to safety, and ravenous wolves are trying to eat them.All in all, the movie is slow and you'll find yourself feeling it should be almost over throughout many points in the movie. If you don't take it too seriously and can stand a slower pace, it is a decent movie."
1,The Grey,"When I purchased this movie, it looked like and I hoped, something authentic. It isn't even close. As a biologist who has worked with wolves in the past, I can say that the writer/director's depiction is a complete fabrication and utterly inaccurate. Might be best to read something on the subject next time and do a little research before creating this sort of adventure movie. I was also disappointed that Neeson went along with the sham. He does a disservice to wildlife and wolves. This movie was closer to Little Red Riding Hood than something modern and accurate. It has action, violence and suspense, but little more. Thumbs down. I doubt I will view it again."
1,Steer clear of this turkey.,The Grey is a very depressing and factually incorrect movie. Why didn't you stay with the plane people? The black box emits a location radio signal beacon. Rescuers would have come for you. Gave it one star for the scenery. I wasted $3.99.
2,Thanks for the subtle philosophy lesson *sarchasm*,If I want to see how miserable life can be without any hope of redemption I will just turn on the news next time.
1,"just bad, really really bad",its was one of the worse movies. too many unbelievable parts. it was like a bad horror flick. the only thing missing was the teenage couple getting killed while having sex. give me a break.
4,Very exciting.,"A group of men see their plane go down in an extremely cold climate. The few that survive find themselves dealing with not only the extreme cold, but a pack of hungry wolves. One of the men assumes a leadership role because of his knowledge of the wolves. This is an intense and exciting movie that avoids being a standard action film where characters you don't care about are killed one-by-one. The brutality of the wolves is evident and the efforts of the men to survive are amazing. You will find yourself invested in their determination and saddened when the effort is for naught. This is a good one."
2,Weak film,"Despite the intensity that is depicted in the plane crash, and the overall Alaskan atmosphere, the film is dull, save a few briefs scenes. Rent only if you're a die hard Neeson fan, and love how his intimate authority on the most obscure of situations saves the day."
2,The poem was good...but what's the Grey?,"There are much better written review's, so I'll just keep it short. I was expecting a survival movie, which I got, but I totally agree with others that the idiocy of the chain of events is just so very hard to ignore. Tried to watch and get into the feeling and emotion of men and God....but then the wolves would come back and I couldn't do anything but shout at the TV ""A wolf wouldn't do that!!"" Not the greatest..."
1,GOOD MOVIE TO LEARN HOW TO CURSE,"GREAT CURSING COURSE.I THINK THE LAST 10 MINUTES WERE THE LEAST CURSING PERIOD OF TIME.NON-SENSE MOVIE,I WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK!"
2,Just a disappointment,"I was really looking forward for this movie. What a disappointment. At least kill the wolf at the end, but no."
1,Horrible Movie,This movie has made it into the top ten WORST movies ever. Virtually no character development and when there was it was too little too late. The director is applauding I could have directed this movie better drunk. And villianizing the wolf.....jeez THATS a brand new idea. Ugh. If you want to see a movie about real men surviving and connecting man to man I highly recommend The Brotherhood of the Wolf. Don't bother with this movie.
1,A truly bad movie,"I took my girlfriend to see this (I know, big mistake). She's generally skeptical of these movies, but after watching the previews she was game for a boy-flick. This genre is right up my alley so I was really looking forward to it. The trailer spins it at sort of a man vs wild primal thriller a bit like Anthony Hopkins' ""The Edge"" meets LOST. It's not. It's contrived, over-acted, cliched and full of ""why's"" such as:Why don't they just stay with the plane;Why don't they make spears to defend themselves;Why don't they build shelters to keep out the wolves;Why are they trying to out run wolves;Why is he taping airplane bottles to his fingers;Why aren't the animated wolves convincing;SPOILER ALERT::::::::::The ending was really dumb--think Sopranos series fanale."
1,ultraviolet? confusing,I'm confused if this is a digital copy AND ultraviolet? or if the ultraviolet is supposedly the digital copy included (which is a joke)
2,Delivery was terrible.,"We tried watching this via the Amazon PS3 interface. The sound was terrible. The spoken parts of the movie were so low, I had to turn the volume up to 35 on my TV (normally it's at 14), but when a sound effect or music sequence came up, it shook the walls and made my ears bleed it was so loud. We lasted about 5 minutes having to adjust the volume ever 3 seconds. It wouldn't have been such a big deal if this was the first time it happened, but it wasn't.The consolation I got was that the Amazon rep I talked to immediately refunded our rental price. That's why I will always remain an Amazon customer.Now for the movie itself, it was pretty good. If I would have spent the money to see it in a theater, it would have been so-so. I'm glad I waited, but either way, it was good. It doesn't hurt if you're a Liam Neeson fan."
2,I love Neesan but ...,"I love Liam. Taken was superb. Rob Roy was excellent. But I am a fan of Justice (See Die Hard 1 where Mclean empties a magazine into 1 guy; or - case in point ""Taken"" the scene with electric diaodes in the perp's thigh), and happy endings. But an ending where everybody dies? Ah jees! What a waste of my time ...Nice scenery. Nice philosophy. But then if I wanted this I'd get a screen saver or a copy of Nietzche ..."
3,Wow!!,So graphic and hard to watch for me. My husband loved. The actors did a great job I thought. I liked the unfolding of their inter-selves as they worked to survive.
3,They Grey,"I thought the acting was good, but the ending left something to be desired. I don't like movies that end on a down note."
3,Not as entertaining as the trailer.,There are a lot of scenes that bore you to death as their literally nothing interesting happening. The only parts I enjoyed were the battle scenes between the victims and the abnormally aggressive wolves. This too gets me wondering if there is more to the plot than just 7 lost men and wolves trying to take them out one by one.
3,Deep and thought provoking,I have come to realize that most movies are not going to be realistic. It makes watching a movie more enjoyable once you accept thatThat being said this movie is no exception. Many people have already pointed out the things wrong so I will not go into those here.I thought the movie was thought provoking in the respect of what a person's emotions go through when dealing with death and loneliness.
3,Glad I didn't pay much to see it,"Good story line, good acting, just very long. Don't watch with your girlfriend or wife if their not into it, or you will be watching it by yourself."
3,Starts with a bang; ends with a fizzle,"When I saw a movie starring Liam that featured wolves, I was all in! The scenery was fabulous. The story was ok. Liam Neeson, as always, gave a stellar performance. The wolves weren't as realistic as they could have been.The ending was predictable and leaves you dangling. I really don't like that in movies...it's a personal pet peeve. Overall, it is worth watching...just prepare yourself to be left hanging at the end."
3,somewhat disappointing,"thought this would be a great watch since the reviews online were between 4-5 stars. but unfortunately,it didn't deliver for me. the movie plot is like watching ""Alive"" meets ""White Fang""."
4,"""Bark at the Moon""","I loved almost every second of The Grey. Movies about people surviving out in the wilderness have always interested me.The cast was believable (Liam Neeson at his best), they filmed on location (you can almost feel the cold), and it dove into deeper issues than just surviving a large pack of wolves. This film is like a horror and action film rolled into one. The wolf attacks are almost horror movie gory.Some people are complaining about the open ending, which I liked, but if you stay after the end credits you get about a 5 second look at the aftermath.For a January release, The Grey is much more of a high calibur film than I expected."
1,garbage,"I thought it looked pretty cool from the cover and the trailer. In fact, it appears to start out with some credible entertainment in the beginning and when the plane crashes--however quickly denigrates into a monotonous and unrelenting chase by a pack of fanciful, fake appearing wolves. Somehow the actors can only speak in 4 letter words to express themselves. ***SPOILER ALERT** Ends with Liam Neeson vehemently rejecting faith, considering his prior suicide attempt, focusing on his own self-absorbed nihilism and then dies. I ended up just skipping chapters which I never do in movies. Leaves you feeling hopeless and unhappy with yourself that you wasted 2 hours and three dollars. Find a more uplifting and creative movie elsewhere."
4,The Grey,"The Grey was what I expected from Niam Leeson, and was fairly predictable. The end, however, left me feeling like it was unfinished. I understand what the director was going for, but nonetheless was not satisfying. Definitely a rental and glad I did not pay movie theater prices. Recommend watching."
3,An experiment gone wrong?,"This album seems to mess with the tried and true Kottke formula. It is mellower, more New Age than, say, 6 & 12 String Guitar. On several songs you also hear Kottke using a synthesizer to make other instrumental sounds. If you happen to like that, great. If you're buying this because you liked 6 & 12 String Guitar, you might be disappointed."
5,Best Racing Game Ever by far,"This is the only game that I have that I can play over and over and not get bored. The graphics alone blow any other racing game away. Even the sound is good. But, the greatest feature of this game is that you customize everything to your liking. You want to race 1 lap? Done. You want a 20 lap race? Done. You want your own music in the background? Go for it. I could go on.This game is so realistic that it makes you wonder why all racing games can't be like this. I will admit, this game is hard when you first begin playing. But once you get the hang ofit, there is no racing game on this planet that can touch it. You can do burnouts, wheelies, endos, and more. Do you need moreproof? Look at the price of this game. FIFTY DOLLARS! What game this old is still that high? Enough said."
3,good enough but . . .,"The sense of speed is great, but you will either love or hate the ""realistic"" steering. There is no arcade steering option so you will have to make carefully plotted turns and adjust your bike's engine to win races. But more importantly, the graphics are a bit plain, with lots of stuff in the far distant background of the track. The bike models look great but you won't see much of them on the track after the first lap. You are basically driving for the best time, with the other bikers in front or behind you in the distance. It makes for a somewhat sterile racing experience."
5,The BEST Health Journal I've Seen!,"In my work, I see and evaluate many health journals. This one is, by far, the best I have ever seen. I will be recommending it to all the readers and patients with whom I work. Keeping one journal page per day, this will let you journal for three months. The plastic spiral binding lets it lie flat, and the ends of the binding don't snag. The vinyl cover makes it quite durable, and it's size allows you to carry it with you quite easily."
4,"Memory Minder, Personal Health Journal",A good little diary & symptom log if you need to keep taps on your medical progress.
2,Memory Minder Personal Health Journal,I think this journal is too descriptive. It takes too long to fill out the pages. FOR ME? I didn't like it much.
4,I love it !,"I like this book a lot, it is just what I wanted. I would add a zipper pouch to the back for health receipts then it would be perfect !"
5,memory minder is a great product for a health log,"The memory minder is a health/medical journal. You can keep records of your daily health information along with food log, and dr. appts. exercize and other observations. It is very well organized and easy to use. I recommend it."
4,My grandson said is the best birthday gift ever.,"I feel this costume was overpriced for the quality. It is not just like the picture and not really good quality. That said, my grandson will not take it off and loves it. I guess that is what this is all about. Thanks, Ruth Posey"
4,Halloween costume,"I got this for my son for a Halloween costume. He enjoyed wearing it, I bought a lightsaber to go with it and he was pleased. It is not very sturdy, but not a lot of costumes are."
2,Where's Garvey's Ghost?,"There's almost no information anywhere about this re-release, but so far as I can tell, it only includes the 10 tracks of Marcus Garvey, not the additional 10 dubs of Garvey's Ghost. The label website says 20 tracks, but the CD itself only lists 10. Strange. For now, I'd recommend sticking with the 100th Anniversary edition that has both albums on one disc. I haven't listened to this, though, so I can't vouch for how the remastering sounds."
2,Not That Great,"I bought this CD because I've always seen it near the top of lists of the greatest Reggae albums. I've given it many listens but I'm afraid I just don't get it. Every song is basically 3 1/2 minutes long and all start to sound the same. I didn't like this nearly as much as Marley, Tosh, Toots and the Maytalls, Jimmy Cliff, etc.Even the dub versions disappointed me, being in the same lengths as the vocal versions. I guess I like my dub a lot more stretched out and adventurous.I thought this sounded dated, same-y and boring."
5,one of the greatest,"ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO ANY RECORD COLLECTIONpowerful lyrics, great melodies, untouchable rhythm"
2,Argh!,"Less than 30 days after installation, ports 27 & 28 stoped working. This problem was painful to diagnose due to our LAN configuration.Netgear customer service was easy to deal with, but charges to ship a replacement before receiving the defective unit. If you need to keep your network up until the replacement comes, you'll have to pay.Update: The replacement unit is still working now after a few months but I wouldn't give it any more stars."
5,Reliable switch at a great price.,I bought these switches to connect two separated building over fiber. They seem to do the job well and we have had no need to reset so far.
5,Great Value,These shocks are a great value... Good quality handling at a great price. 1990 BMW E34 205K. Still rolling and still holding its own.
2,Chopped and confused,"Writer clearly struggled writing this book, and could not figure out what he was trying to say. Choppy inconsistent and generally boorish."
2,Defective,"I agree this is a defective controller. This breaks my heart too because I love the feel of this control over any other PS2 controller on the market. The problems are the potentiometers break on these, causing it to stick right or left. Unfortunately, I had the same problem -- the right analog stick thinking I was pushing it to the right. This happened on two controllers. I finally took it upon myself to open both of the controllers up and looked at the board. To my amazement, the construction of the board on these is extremely cheap.I'd pay $75 for this controller if it actually was solid, which it unfortunately isnt."
1,Defective,"This is an extremly defective product. I have bought two of the already. i returned the first one because it kept telling the ps2 I was pressing the select button when I wasnt. after I got the second one, the second I took it out of the packaging, the right analog stick pushed to the left and stayed there. This one also had the select button problem. This would be a good product if these problem were not here."
3,too heavy & batteries wear out too fast,wears out the batteries too fast & its too heavy for long playing not too cool of a controller
2,Different item than what was ordered,"My husband and I had ordered the Minn Kota ""Vanishing Prop""(or so we believed), as it was pictured above the item #. What arrived was a solid black prop, not the smoke/clear deep cup ""vanishing prop"" we thought we'd ordered. Very disappointed, will keep the prop; as it will do as a ""back up"". Will order the ""Vanishing Prop"" from another site/source. Unacceptable business deal, will NOT use this seller again."
2,McDowell should stick more closely to matters of faith...,"When McDowell honestly sticks to matters of faith, he does a little better, but here he falls into his regular pattern of sneaking in right-wing conservative opinions and presenting them as ""Christian"" values. Granted, our children need more guidance, and they need to learn right from wrong, but McDowell's opinions and interpretations might tend to mislead rather than enlighten. In fact, they can tend to foster and contribute to the religious hypocrisy, religious bigotry, intolerance, prejudice and divisiveness out there. He conveniently forgets or ignores some of the most the essential teachings of Jesus, and he seems to be oblivious to the fact that Jesus would actually be an advocate for many of the things and many of the people that McDowell hates. I'm sure he means well, but his views reveal that he has been heavily indoctrinated by ideas that have more to do with right-wing conservative politics than with true Christianity."
2,Misleading picture and title,"The description of this toy is 15"" and the picture is different than the Disney store one which I could of bought for $16.50 from their store. This not what I received; I received exactly what the Disney store sells and has their tag on it. In short I paid almost 3x what this toy is worth for something that is not what it looks like in the pictures, and is 12"", not 15"".The toy itself looks fine for a child, so I have no complaints there but I am annoyed by the misleading of what is being sold. If I wanted a Disney item I would have bought from them, I wanted something softer for the child.Caution when buying from this seller."
4,Fun latin hip-hop workout,"I enjoy doing this workout. I've been through it twice already but probably need about two more times to really get the moves comfortably. You go through about 4 different segments and then combine them at the end into a full routine. I like the choreography, a lot of it looks straight out of the music videos. Gloria is a wonderful dancer and excellent at cueing. Her background dancers are also pretty good, and give a variety of dance styles to watch. The music is instrumental, and doesn't quite have the driving energy of the reggaeton music we're all used to hearing, but it's okay. The workout is about 35 minutes long."
2,O.K. Workout DVD,"I gave it 2 stars b/c it wasn't what I expected. I was expecting real Reggaeton music, Boricuas or Latinos doin tha dance workout, and real Reggaeton dancing, a.k.a. EL PERREO. The video is real corni especially the backup dancers but it is a workout dvd that got me out of breath by tha end of it. I'm a slow learner & begginer at these dance video workouts, so it took me 3 times to be able to learn the moves without messing up so much."
4,fun and energetic workout,"I was leery of this DVd since her other Urban Heat DVD had been roundly mocked, but this one is a lot of fun. Its not advanced choreography but she keeps it moving and she does know how to build on the phrases to keep you focused. I found myself going over a few sections just for the fun of it. I also like how her warm-up and cool-down is dance-y. She is a little hard to understand but once you commit to going wit the flow it's all good!"
2,Not worth it,"The romance was too way too slow, their love confessions don't even happen until the second-to-last page, the story was hard to follow, I never saw evidence of Rosamund being prim and proper and ""perfect,"" the intimacy scene was not even described! - It was something like, ""Their coupling was long in coming and pleasurable."" -Skip this one."
5,A TOUCH OF HUMOR,"This story of stoic Richard Maitland (introduced in ""Whisper His Name"" and ""Princess Charming"") will not disappoint. What I really liked, and found a bit surprising for an ET book, was the humor. Since Maitland was always so serious in the books mentioned above, it was a delight to see him in a situation infused with humor and an unconventional heroine. A good plot, with a twist you won't see coming, make this a keeper. Another recommendation I have to make is LAUREN BACH's ""LONE RIDER"". I like to switch between ""historicals"" and modern day stories. ""Lone Rider"" is a sexy thriller. Check it out!"
1,WHO IS THIS???????????????????????????????????????,NO STARS AMAZON!!!who is this guy???/ How did he wind up on the amazon music list under the name PANTERA???

DIMEBAG DARREL/IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THIS GUY INSTEAD OF YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But Who? CAN TURN BACK TIME???????????????????????????????????????/
2,Some Pros some Cons ... a bit of a dissapointment,"I only watched the one title ""Tell Me Why: Plant/Birds/Rodents""It had its merits, but was a bit disappointing for lack of accuracy with video & many 'facts'.PROS: nice & basic for intro to the topicsCONS: often talking about one animal & showing another on the video (e.g. long talk about Mockingbird nesting while video shows two different sparrow species on nests ... and many more like this); many of the 'facts' are not correct (e.g. Peregrine Falcon can fly 70mph ... well they top out over 200mph, and many more errors like it)OVERALL: Obviously amateur production ... and I liked that part! But the producers should correct and re-release after fact checking with experts and making sure that they show the correct animal on the video as it is being discussed."
3,este es le libro de magia para empezar,"Bueno, el verdadero nombre de este libro en ingles es magia practica para principiantes:tecnicas y rituales para enfocar energia magica. es un libro que es demasiado empaquetado y lo quiere abarcar todo y no dice nada y lo peor de todo son los hechizos!! que si tienes las velas las lleve, pues claro, la vela es algo fundamental en cualquier hechizo. LE DOY 3 ESTRELLAS. hay mejores libros como el de ellen dugan ""magia con las hierbas""."
2,"Dreadful, immature work of fiction","I first heard about this collection from a general review that Time magazine gave last summer on hot new contemporary writing. This writing is hot, as in hot and horrible. Most of the stories in this collection are pretencious and incoherent. This is not writing..it is typing..as someone famous once said! There are about three interesting stories in the collection but the rest were truely painful to read. I really didn't respect Ms. Richter as a writer, I thought she was more interested in trends then actually writing about deepfelt characters and emotions. The story about the Cat woman was interesting but indicative of the silly, pop- culture style of writing that Richter seems most interested in. I highly discourage anyone who is interested in serious short fiction from reading this book. The entire thing was just lazy writing."
2,Primetime for Misfits,"Stacey Richter's ""My Date With Satan"" reads like a lite sitcom version of Katherine Dunn's ""Geek Love."" While the book's star ""The Beauty Treatment"" is primetime Emmy material, the rest of the stories might be better considered in the daytime soap category. Lite and silly, yet well-written, ""Satan"" is a good read for college undergrads on spring break."
2,Lite Sitcom,"Stacey Richter's My Date With Satan reads like a lite sitcom version of Katherine Dunn's ""Geek Love."" The book's star ""The Beauty Treatment"" is an Emmy shoe-in."
5,Highly recommended: smart and funny,"I've recommended this book more than any other over the past few years. ""The Beauty Treatment"" is a classic, a story I've re-read several times.I recently read a new story by Stacey Richter in Zoetrope, and I'm happy to say that it was as good as the stories in My Date With Satan."
5,A fresh voice,"About halfway through reading The New Yorker's recent fiction issue -- which focused on young writers and was incredibly laborious with few thinking?? They left out Stacey Richter.I really hope she gets her name out, since I pretty much tripped over it by accident.""An Island of Boyfriends,"" ""Sally's Story,"" ""Prom Night"" all gave me that geez-I've-never-thought-about-that feeling. She has a young, quick style that puts the focus squarely on how it sounds in your mind when you read it.The industry buzz has been that the short story is back. This should be on the A-list of this year's story collections"
3,Amusing and entertaining,"I liked this collection of short stories, but it wasn't enthralling. Some of the stories were really good and very interesting. A few of the stories just didn't strike a chord with me and seemed too pretentious, forced and tried to come across deeper than the story really is. All of the stories are worth a read since they aren't very long, are extremely entertaining and amusing. My favorites are Rats Eats Cats and An Island of Boyfriends . I didn't care too much Beauty Treatment and The First Men. If I could I would give it 3.5 stars out of 5, but amazon's rating system only allows whole stars so I am giving it 3 stars."
2,It's Jackie Suzann meets Tamara Janowitz on fast forward!,"Stacey Richter's non-stop, in-your-face velocitous prose is an exhausting trip through the mind of the modern teenage shopaholic. Brand names become stand-ins for biblical and literary references. Watch any X-Gen sitcom, and you've got the flavor and pace of Ms. Richter's stories. Recommended strongly for the tonguetip-activated brain of the late 90's."
1,Disappointed,"The calendar would be great if it was what was listed. Listed was a 2008 calendar refill and I received a 2009 calendar refill. 2009 is a half a year away. If I was told the 2008 was not available, I would have asked for a refund. The reason I ordered from Amazon was that I have always had great luck with it; and, I had already ordered on Ebay a 2008 calendar refill and I received from them a 2009 refill also. That is why I went to Amazon. Now I have TWO 2009 refills that do me no good until 6 months from now, and when 2009 IS here, I will only need one! What a disappointment!"
4,dirty blues,"This is a nicley packaged collection of songs that would never get radio play due to their explict lyrics. For the most part the songs have suggestive lyrics, but some leave little for interpretation and use profanity. Some of the artists are well known such as Jackie Wilson and Dinah Washington for their mainstream jazz and pop while others are obscure. The cd comes with a fantastic booklet that includes the lyrics as well as pictures and information of the artists. Most of the songs are from the late 1940's or 1950's and are up tempo. If you like jazz and bebop with suggestive lyrics it would be a good addition to your collection. Just be warned that the content ranges from mild to wild and this certainly isn't for everyone. I am instantly reminded of a line from ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" ,""People come to my place to dance erotically."""
4,"Good, but not Dylan's best","No doubt about it, ""Blood on the Tracks"" is a very solid piece of work. Each of the 10 songs is a winner with ""Tangled Up In Blue"" and ""You're a Big Girl Now"" standing above the pack. But this is not Dylan's best album by any means. It falls far short of his true masterpiece (""Blonde on Blonde""), and even pales beside such woefully underrated efforts such as ""Desire,"" ""Street Legal,"" and ""Shot of Love."" Furthermore, once you've heard the powerful live version of ""Idiot Wind"" that appears on the ""Hard Rain"" album, there seems to be no point in even listening to the original studio cut again (and by ""original,"" I mean both the version that appears here and the earlier rendition that was released on ""The Bootleg Series Vol. 1-3""). The lyrics convey plenty of rage and fury, but Dylan's performance does not, making the song one to admire, primarily for the lyrics, but not one to feel in your gut."
5,It doesn't get much better than this,"Wonderful, eclectic, heartfelt and amazing. Buy it, plug it in the CD and it will stay there. His best work."
5,Nothing comes close,"Having read the wafflings of my mainly American co-reviewers, a view from the UK. A friend of mine introduced me to this album in 1976, but being a heavy metal fan, and a Dylan cynic, I wasn't too keen to listen. However, the songs were so strong and the emotions so intense, that I couldn't avoid being enthralled. This is without doubt the greatest album ever written. 'Nuff said!"
5,Dylan Wears His Heart On His Sleeve!,"This is my favourite Dylan album as it embodies all that is great about Dylan, the brilliant use of words and in this case, the emotional outpouring that is very personal and heartrending. Anyone who has gone or is going through any emotional rollercoaster ride can identify and empathise with this album. It's also a great way to recuperate knowing that even the great Dylan himself isn't immune to such downtimes. Almost makes us feel the great man is also one of us. This version has been remastered and comes in a very nice looking mini-lp replica sleeve as well. Highly recommended!"
5,Dylans Best LP,"Simply the best 10 songs ever put together on one LP. (even better than most greatest hits LPs) From the classic ""Tangled up in Blue"" to my favorite "" ... and the Jack of Hearts"", Dylan captures his listeners attention like a giant fireworks display and wont let you go until the last track if finished. A must have in anyones collection."
5,Dylan's Greatest Achievement!,"You could debate for hours on the topic of what is the greatest Dylan album. Is it Highway 61? Is it Blonde on Blonde? Is it Bringing it All Back Home?Though they are all brilliant albums the best of Dylan's 30 plus studio albums would have to be Blood on the Tracks. This is Dylan's most personal albums. For his first three classics he explored the problems of the world. He explores the difficulties of his own life. He explores love being won and love being lost. He sings of being ""Tangled Up in Blue"", looking out for a ""Simple Twist of Fate"", and of a woman giving him ""Shelter From the Storm."" He sings of kindness and generosity. All is done with his brilliant accoustic guitar and a fine backing group.In conclusion Blood on the Tracks is Dylan's most listenable and appealing album. It is a folk rock classic. Dylan's Greatest Achievement. No fan of real music should be without it! GET IT NOW!"
1,"Tape quality extremely poor,. Should have known better!","I've never received a poor-quality tape from Amazon before, but there's always a first time and this was it. It's worse than my old tape. It's nothing I can listen to. Sounds like it's being played on a noisy old ferris wheel going up and down!Thanks for asking!"
2,Picture of the Great Over-rated,"""Shelter from the Storm"" is great; ""Tangled Up in Blue"" is a good song. But listening to ""Idiot Wind"" or ""Rosemary, Lilly and the Jack of Hearts"" is enough to make you want to puncture your eardrums with an ice pick."
2,more like Karo syrup with red food coloring on the tracks,"Fair album. About as good as Highway 61 Revisited.What annoys about his writing is the way he tosses in mindless lyrics that have nothing to do withANYTHING...but the guy does it because he needs a rhymer. Way to go, Bob. You've gotten away with it for decades--and those who worship the ground you walk on don't know any better.To be honest, I have liked some of this man's work: Knockin' On Heaven's door is a clasic; have liked TIME OUT OF MIND, have liked THE ESSENTIAL BOB DYLAN; think his CHRONICLES is a fine autobiography...I just don't happen to think every time the man sneezes that it should be hailed as a work of genius and/or a masterpiece.My 2 cents."
4,"Remaster - Mangled Up In Blue ..., but recovers.","This is my favorite Dylan record and so I was happy to buy this CD a second time to check out the remastering. I was at first shocked by the mangled ""Tangled Up In Blue"" as the mix does not feel true to the original release. There's too much reverb on Bob's voice, the drum's are up in your face, and the bass is buried. But the rest of the record recovers nicely and comparing the remastered tracks side by side with my first copy of the CD release shows these songs in far better detail. It's much louder too without sounding at all compressed. It's a shame about the first track as that song means the most to me out of Bob's entire catalog."
5,"Probably Bob's best, but that's a tough call...",This does not have a bad song on it. It is a work of art! Something I have come to expect from Bob with each album down thru the years.It is minimum five stars...the best of the best.
5,Dylan's best,"This is easilly my favorite Dylan album. With some of the most mature songwriting and clever word play of his career, every track on this album is a standout. From the opening chords of ""Tangled Up in Blue,"" the amazing lead track, this album carries the listener through worlds of meloncholy, lost love, and hope as only Dylan can. It is a soaring and complex achievement, with beautiful instrumental arrangements. This album also features some of Dylan's best story songs, the 8+ minute ""Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts"" being an obvious example. There is simply nothing bad about this album, and in the five years I've owned it it has never sounded a day older. This is a soundtrack for life, for all of our lives, as universal and personal as anybody could want. I can not imagine my life without this album."
4,pretty good as an album,"this is one of those albums youre supposed to listen to all at once not track by track.anyhow,#1 is ""tangled up in blue"".im not sure what the moral to the story is but its a good song.the next 3 songs are ok but of listened to back to back are more enjoyable.the next song i really liked was ""youre gonna make me lonesome when you go"".the rest is just average.but averahe for dylan neans better than 95% of the stuff out there."
4,One of the best,I bought it long before CDs and since now I don't own an LP player I decided to purchase also the CD. If you love Dylan you can't live without it.
3,vastly over-rated,"This is okay. It has its inspired moments; it has its embarrassing moments. It's certainly not one of Dylan's best records. (His best three records are ""Blonde On Blonde"", ""Desire"", and ""New Morning"".) By the bye, the lyrical snippet inaccurately quoted below is really:""People tell me it's a sin/To know and feel too much within/I still believe she was my twin/But I lost the race/She was born in spring/And I was born to late/Blame it on a simple twist of fate."""
3,I Must Be a Heretic...,"Because I'm not that much of a Bob Dylan fan. My initial impressions of this album is that it is *OK* but nothing worth really shaking a stick at. My favorite tracks were ""Tangled Up in Blue"" which was pretty popular, and ""Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts"" which is really upbeat. I'm just not in a place right now where I can fully appreciate slow, quiet music, no matter how brilliant the lyrics are. Perhaps in a few years this will begin to shine for me."
3,this is my only dylan album and here's why,"I read about this being such a great album. The songwriting, the lyrics, etc. etc. So I bought it. The best thing that I can say about it is that it seems to release a soft warm glow, like a coal in a fire. It works well in the background. What I don't like about the album is how most of the characters are these macho types who treat women in the old American stereotypical fashion of ""women are weak and therefore need to be protected and sheltered"". A lot of the women characters in these folk stories only seem to exist to prop up the male protagonist's macho outlaw ego and to ""love him strong"". The guy goes to the strip joint and after the show the stripper is right behind him. Whatever. How lame. I can't help remembering the old story (myth?) about Dylan going over to Kerouac's door and Kerouac yells at Dylan and calls him a fake folk singer. Because folk is supposed to be about singing from own heart and this is more about adolescent fantasy."
5,so far the best of the SACDS,"I have 4 of the SACD/remasters. Now I'm not disputing the music content which does not need a mention, to me all are 5 star. BUT this is by far better than Highway 61 and Blond on Blond for audiophile qaulity. My wife put kleenex in her ears to dull the high frequency responce which unfortunately I have to admit can be become grating on the ear drums from these 2 SACDS(this problem is not on all of the tracks).Blood on the tracks though must be about the best quality SACD I own. Fantastic music and recording. The other SACD I have is Love and Theft which is also a very good remaster though not as good as blood on the tracks. What went wrong with highway and blond I dont know, maybe its the way the master tapes sound and now I'm hearing it as it should sound."
4,"One Great Dylan ""Album' etc","I grew up with Dylan, listening mostly to the classics lke maggies farm, Like a Rolling Stone and tambourine man, but, after a long hiatus from his poetry and music, I was driving in my car after having dealt with a tough fight with my wife of 25 years, when I heard the song ""Shelter From the Storm"" after which I actually found the reason I needed to not only fall in love again, but to actually pick up the acoustic guitar again and start to play. That has to mean something about his talent, Lay lady lay, is also quite special. Dylan wil no doubt be cool again, just you wait and see.Steve Castellanos stevencpr@aol.com"
4,Let's talk about the SACD 5.1 Mix,"Blood on the tracks has been reviewed so often, I just wanted to say this 5.1 mix is amazing. I've heard this album a hundred times and with this mix, I'm hearing instruments I never noticed before. Really amazing."
3,Too much purple,"There is too much purple. I like purple album covers, but this is not a purple album. The music does not have much to do with the color purple. The original was definitely more red. Dylan did not have purple hair at this stage in his career. If you are thinking of buying this because it is purple please be aware it is really not a purple record. Moby Grape made purple abums with purple covers. Tell your kids this was not a purple record. They may think this was originally purple."
2,Be aware of what Dylan it is you seek,"I'll probably be kicked in my Cyber teeth by all of the Dylanophiles online, but this has to be said:If you are into Dylan for his carnalvalistic lyrical rides, then DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM. It is full of much more introspective and straight-forward themes.This is more like a ""beer"" record. Toss one back and reminece. Then when you're over it, go put on Hwy. 61 or something."
2,A few questions,"How is it possible to play the harmonica, professionally, for twenty years and still show no sign of improvement? Zimmerman? Zimmerframe more like, you cactus-faced crock of cack."
2,Bob Dylan's most overrated album,I dont care if someone think I am ignorant or anything but I never felt this was a great Dylan album. Many call this his best but I beg to differ. Definitly NOT his best...but not his worst either. Average album with 3 great songs...the rest are ok..not great.
5,really helped me quit!,"When Anne spoke about my higher power wanting me to be a nonsmoker, that is what got to me the most. I know this intuitively and it resonated within me to hear it verbalized in such a way.Jennifer"
2,It's okay- but I'm still smoking,"This is not what I expected. The audio recording is of poor quality- and it didn't seem to help me. I could relate to several people on the cd but not sure how that was supposed to help me quit smoking- which I am still smoking. Honestly, I believe it all begins with the mind and when the mind is trained to start or stop something, it will."
3,MERE'S MERRY Review,"The book, Like Water for Chocolate was a crafty written book mixing magic with food, sex with violence, and love on horse back, all that fun engaging stuff middle aged women with no sex life like to read. Who is perceisly who I'd recommend this book to. Like Water for Chocolate was an enjoyable read if you like romance in a mystical sense. I gave the book an overall 3 stars."
4,Like Water for Chocolate,"The book ""Like Water for Chocolate"" is a great book. The book deals with a teen-age girl who wants to marry but can't because her family tradition won't allow her to. The tradition is that she is unable to marry because she is the youngest and will need to take care of her mother.I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars. The book gets kind of confusing but overall it is a good book that deals with love and desire."
5,A Mexican Cinderella Story,"Imaginatively told, romantic and sensual - this is a Latin-style fairy tale for adults only. Tita, our heroine, has a life of work & misery, caused by her mother who is cruel beyond reason to her and has brainwashed her since birth into believing that the youngest daughter must remain a spinster and take care of her mother for ever. Fortunately Tita is blessed with magical cooking skills that allow her to attract lovers and cast many types of spells over the people that consume her dishes, amazing events occur all around her. Tita is not the only talented member of the family either, her sisters are notable personalities as well.I recommend this as a light & funny escape from reality."
5,La pasion latina en su apogeo,"Definitivamente, esta obra por Laura Esquivel es facinante. La autora por medio de descripciones vivas nos presenta la realidad del mundo hispanoamericano. La sensualidad, sexualidad, pasion, creencias, opresiones que forman parte de la cultura a hispanoamericana se derrama por medio de las situaciones y personajes de la novela. El lenguaje aunque es simple no deja de ser preciso y crea un ambiente de magia en el cual nos sumergimos mientras leemos y se nos hace casi imposible no impregnarnos de la pasión que emiten los olores de la cocina de Tita, el personaje principal."
5,It was as described.,The book was as described... Nice content and not hard to understand for non-native Spanish speakers. I'd recommend it. Excellent product.
5,Como Agua Para Chocolate,"I ordered this book on Oct.18th it got to my house by the 29th it was in great condition (i bought it new) like it said it would be, so im very pleased about that! I didnt like that it didnt have a way to track it i think it would have been preferable if it had. Great book now i have a good Christmas gift for my mom!"
1,The worse book ever,"I honestly was shocked when i read this book. I arrived until the end only because other people had told me it was amazing. But, with all my heart, with all the good will i put in reading it, i couldn' t find one single nice page! At leat it helped with my spanish, but i could have helped myself with other books if i knew this was so horrible."
1,Wrote with feet/Escrito con las patas,"Do not be mislead, if you want to read something good in Spanish read something else (Gabo García Márquez or Juan Rulfo, for instance). This story was rescued in the film, really! It is curious how such bad writing seems much better when someone else tells the story. It has very nice ideas, but she has this ability to spoil it with her poor language.¡No lean esta porquería! Está escrita completamente con las patas, esta chava debería ir a tomar unas clasecitas. Lo que sí me llama mucho la atención es como se las arregla para echar a perder ideas tan buenas, porque si alguien más cuenta la historia se oye bien, como en la película, donde ni la mala actuación ni la poca naturalidad de los protagonistas no logra echar a perder el cuento."
4,good book,"The book i read was""Like water for chocolate"" is a love story It was by Luara Esquivel. the story was okay it had many sad parts. The story was about this family tradition The family tradition was that the youngest girl can't get married unilt her mom has died. Evey chapter is a month and every month has a recipe.The recipe is from the old times.The two main person were Tita and Pedro. Tita is the youngest in her family so she can't get married unilt her mom dies. Tita fall in love with Pedro.I think the sroy was okay so people sould read it."
3,Imaginativo e historico...,"Como agua para Chocolate captura la cultura latinoamericana con su sabor a miel y fuego, con la dulzura de la noche y la agresividad de sus familias. La historia es excelente, pero en cierta manera antigua en la manera en que el romanticismo captura los personajes. Es una buena introduccion a los andares de la literatura latinoamericana pero no una obra maestra en este genero."
4,Amazing Beginning for CH,"This cd is by far one of Cypress Hill's (CH's) best cds; in my opinion, second best to their ""Black Sunday"" album. However, I am partial as the ""Black Sunday"" album was the first of CH's that I had ever listened to... back when I was just a lad.Anyway, the beats are traditional for them (if you have ever listened to any of their stuff); with a heavy bass sound projected from a woofer... along with the frequent ""echo shouts"" and sirens/screech sounds in the background. The vocals/raps are mainly projected from somewhat nasaly, but talented flow-er B-Beal.While traditional, it is a style and sound that I have grown to greatly appreciate... no it is not your 2Pac; or even the current talent of somone like The Game for that matter... but it is what it is. If you have heard and liked any of CH's later stuff, I am sure you will enjoy this cd. If you are new to CH's music, perhaps you may find a better respect for them by listening to the ""Black Sunday"" cd first."
5,Black Sunday doesn't even compare.,"Most people regard ""Black Sunday"", Cypress Hill's second studio album, to be their finest work. Those people are insane."
5,Hip-hop Perfection,"Their debut they could never top. B Real's rhymes are complex and imaginitive, and through subsequent releases get more and more simple. Everything about this album, the beats, samples, rhymes, it's uniquness, makes it a king among kings in the hip-hop world. Did you know the guitar sample in the refrain of How I Could Just Kill A Man is from the Jimi Hendrix song Are You Experienced?"
1,"Looks cute, but not the greatest","I bought this safe for my 9 year-old daughters to keep their money in. I was a little disappointed with this product because it is really hard to turn the knob on the lock around to the correct numbers. My girls couldn't do it at all and I could barely do it. So that kind of took some of the fun out of it for them. Then once it is opened, it is really hard to get closed and then of course its hard to turn the knob to lock it. So if I had to do it over again, I probably would have gone with something else."
1,Returned after receiving from a catalog,"I purchased this item for my seven year old niece. I gave it one star because it is just so darn cute. After receiving through a catalog purchase, I returned it due to lack of quality. The door didn't quite close right (seemed like you could pry it open if you tried) and the knob was not smooth to turn (felt like metal was rubbing on metal). I didn't want to give a perceived ""cheap gift"". I am shopping for something better made for the money."
2,for 6yr old Christmas gift,"My daughter (6yr) loved having her own safe but she can not open herself which caused a lot of frustration. The knob is difficult to turn even for adult..doesn't spin easily. She also had a hard time grasping the ""code"" (turn right to #, turn left past first # to second #). I think I would have waited until she was a little older for this particular safe, or found one with a simpler combination lock."
5,Best workout ever!,The workout segments are great for people like myself that have 2 young kids to take care of. It gets you excited and you can feel your muscles tension.
3,good for beginners,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.Production quality is still poor but not as bad as the Fat Blasting Bootcamp in this series (that one had volume trouble on top of everything else.) For this one, cameras are still rather blurry/too close/jarring transition with oversaturated color. Music is random and not used for timing the moves.Still, I think the instructor did ok in this one and I liked the simplicity of the moves but it was a miss for my target heart rate zone and I did not get a good workout. That said, I would recommend it for beginners who like this instructor (and would not mind somewhat poor video quality.)"
1,Pretty bad,"Agree with previous reviewer; as a fitness pro myself, I find her weight-lifting speed dangerous and ineffective (too fast and thus uses momentum to lift), and in the cardio portion, she's not even with the beat, which is very annoying. Big disappointment."
1,Save your $10,"I do not recommend this workout. The production quality is pretty poor, and the music level is so low you cannot hear it. Those 2 things alone killed my interest before I even got to the workout. The workout is very repetitive and basic - you may get results, but you'll be so bored that you'll likely not return to the workout.Save your money. If you need an intermediate workout, I'd recommend some of the 10 min solutions videos, especially the ones with Amy Bento as the lead.10 Minute Solution: Hot Body Boot Camp10 Minute Solution: Tone Trouble Zones"
5,Addicted,Missed most of Season 7 so I was excited when I saw it came out on DVD. Criminal Minds never dissapoints. My fav show!
4,Intriguing,I enjoyed this DVD set. It arrived in good time and was in good shape. I spent an entire evening watching.
5,one word awesome!!,Great show n great streaming in the comfortably of your home. Thanks Amazon for making it possible so much better than netflixs.
5,Great Gift!,"This was a Christmas gift for my sister. It arrived promptly, was well packaged (in the original packaging & with extra padding), and she said the disks played well on both her computer and DVD player."
5,Acceptable quality for a video series,This is a video series that is available in many places; here it was at the right price. Therefore we purchased it.
5,Amazing!,"As CM fans know, the show is amazing. But the box set also came in perfect condition and everything was flawless when it showed up and was unpacked. Great work!"
5,Always a great show,"I can't believe it's been 7 years.I still look forward to every episode.Great acting, plots and production values."
5,"Season 7, as good as it gets",Another amazing season as they all are. Every Season brings the same intensity while still being fresh and cutting edge.
5,Love Criminal Minds,We got hooked on these in their first season! They keep coming up with great story lines. I suggest purchase.
5,Did not disappoint.,Very satisfied with my purchase. It did not disappoint me. I will watch for future offerings on this very well-written series.
4,Big Criminal Minds Fan,"Criminal Minds is one of my favorite series on TV. I own all seasons through season 7. All the actors are their characters which makes it seem like watching real life incidents. Of course, these kinds of things do happen in real life.I just love the show and will continue to do so."
5,Excellent,Great season. Can't wait for the next one (here in Latin America we have a long delay to see it). Keep up the good work!
5,Almost Perfect,"The delivery was great. The condition wasn't perfect but it was very good. Nothing wrong with the way it showed. I'm totally inlove with ""Criminal Minds"". The only thing I didn't like was back in the earlier seasons when they got rid of Giddeon. :( But still can't stop watching. I recommend this to everyone."
5,favorite show,Love criminal minds. Season's end was good. Eventhough was expecting a bigger cliff hanger. Leaving us dedicated fans waiting for new season. Bitter sweet to see Prentice leave. Hopefully she will return in future.
5,KangaROO'S Lotus Leather Jogger (Pink),"KangROO'S are Back!! Recieved my order today and was very pleased with it, the item was just as described. The colours to me are a little darker in person than in the photo. very appealing jogger and very comfortable. I would recommend if you prefer a good fit to order your normal size. if you like a looser fitting shoe (not-so-snug) order a half size bigger. Overall very pleased."
3,"Good, not great.","Overall, this is a really good radio unit. I bought it specifically for its BT capabilities, but have encountered several glitches when connecting with my iPhone 3GS. Everything works fine, except I have to manually connect it every time I get in and out of the car, and it should do this automatically when the devices are in range. Well, pretty weird, specially for a product thats key selling point is BT. Everything else is great, has some really cool features."
2,Blaugh Tooth,"This unit is difficult to set-up and use. The manual is difficult to wade through and apparently has important set-up info incomplete or wrong. All and all, very frustrating. We had to do google searches in order to get needed set-up instructions from some other poor soul who had been down this bumpy road before us. I would not by this unit again and cannot recommend it to anyone."
2,"This is not a practical book for ""real life"" multimedia","The book does not reflect real life multimedia project planning.The authors spend too much time on overly complex forms and proceedures. I wonder if they ever worked with an in-house client or a small business wanting multimedia development. I doubt it.If you are working on a very complex project with really stupid clients this might be the book for you.If enjoy working with multimedia and you are working with the average clients, who want a web site or interactive CDROM, I'd advise you look for a different book.I'm currently teaching a multimedia project planning course. A former instructor recommended we use this book. My students and I have recommended that we don't use this book for future courses.The book contains a CDROM which is pretty much extra fluff with no real value."
3,viscioup viper hot sauce,Not 2 bad definatly not the hottest but I liked it not a bad taste just not hot enuff 4 me blaires ultra death sauce is hotter
4,The mind and the eyes will never work the same.,"This book is not only a mind opener, but also an eye opener. The classic Allen Ginsberg poems are felt through another channel that is Drooker's eye catching drawings. Howl is one of my favorite poem and drawing combo where a depiction of a man injecting himself with a drug has fire rising from his back and long beast-like flesh and hair. If you like poetry and art this is one book that combinds both in matrimony."
5,a beautiful book,"This a beautiful book, that not only shares ginsbergs work but works with the images created by eric drooker to communicate the poems and songs vividly, providing candy for the eyes and mind. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys ginsberg, no ginsberg collection is complete without it , in my opinion."
4,Works Great!!,"I've had this item for almost a year. It works as advertised. I have a set of 2. I use one upstairs and one downstairs. In fact I buying a 3rd receiver. The only thing I don't like is the controller only works with Music Match, but if you have a RF controller - like the one offered by Snapstream, you could use itunes to play ur music and contol the player using the third-party remote.Sound is excellent also. For the money it's the best on the market!"
4,Great for the price ...,"I purchased this unit a few months ago for using with Musicmatch.I had subscribed to the On Demand from Musicmatch to listen to at work and I wanted a resonable way to listen to my music on my back porch. Considering that wiring the speakers was going to be a pain, I decided that wireless would be the way to go.First I purchased a set of wireless speakers that were a disaster. This was perfect though. I can sit on my porch and even use the remote.The fact that you can't play it over computer speakers is a bit of a pain, but for the cost and the quality. The positives out weigh the negatives on this one. Highly Reccomended!"
5,Works Great.,"I previously bought an Advent Wireless (AW810) indoor/outdoor speaker, but it was difficult to get it to tune in to the right frequency, and it would not stay tuned in.The Lyra works perfectly with no frequency drift anywhere in the house. House is about 4000 sq ft, the transmitter is upstairs in one corner and the stereo is downstairs in an opposite corner. The remote control also works well anywhere in the house.It would be nice if the remote worked with Windows Media Player, but MusicMatch is not bad"
3,Great Product. Bad Audio Quality.,The product does exactly what is stated. But the audio quality is very poor. Most of the highs and lows are lost in transmission.
5,just plug it in,"works with any player on your computer disregard the software, just plug the thing in and you'll have music transmitted to the receiver which connects with ease to any amp you have laying around."
3,I know a lot of people like this product .....but.....,"I would say that my experience with the Lyra has been only so-so. When it's working, I would agree with the other reviewers--it's great, it sounds great. However, there are times (too frequently, in my opinion) where it will just cut out for no reason or the transmission is ""crackly."" What I have been doing lately is just switching the channel and that seems to work for a little while at least. But that gets old quickly, changing the channel all the time. I paid $20 with shipping so I guess I can't complain too loudly. I think the product is worth $20 but I can't give it more than 3 stars for unpredictable performance."
2,Sounds unworthy,"WTF! The sound quality is SO cheap! There's almost no distortion, but also no bass, or treble. No wonder why it cost me $20. My Shure earphones sounded like claws on blackboard. The only thing good about this is that I can control Musicmatch with the remote. If this thing is so call ""crystal clear digital"", then apparently it's not sending enough digits. And did I mention that I tested the receiver and transmitter only a foot apart. Unless you own some sort of give-away stereo, or need another way to scream across the room, this transmitter is unworthy of a hookup.BTW, it sounds just as crappy with Musicmatch. The transmitter basically acts as a soundcard via USB and of course transmission via RF.If you want to get an idea of how this thing sounds like: take a normal mp3 file, and compress it to the lowest bit-rate, or turn on your radio, oh sorry, radio sounds far more superior."
2,Don't bother,There are many far superior products that satisfy the need for remote access to digital music. Don't waste your money.
5,Excellent product for the price,"For the price, this is as good as it gets. I heard this system at my friend's house and had to get one for myself. I've been very happy with it in all regards thus far."
5,More than you pay for!,"This product works awesome.I bought a $250 media player that took me over an hour to connect just to find out that it didn't play the music I wanted it to. It only played the playlists that I had to build into the system, and it used a specific music program. I took it back.The RD900W does the EXACT job I intended it to do, it takes what ever music I am playing on my computer and plays it through my home stereo, wirelessly. Regardless of the audio program I'm using.The sound quality is perfect, and the hookup?.. Less than ten minutes!!!!!!Simply the best device of it's kind......The price is a bonus!"
5,Great model kit,"Excellent, Very fun to assemble, the only problem is that not enough detail when finally armed, would be great if bring more tags. Definitely a fun product for assemble"
5,Gundam Wing Zero 1/60,"I thought this was a great deal, I've found this same model for at least twice this price. I am very satisfied with this purchase and hope to find more deals such as this."
2,I RECOMMEND THIS FOR ANYONE.....,"i recommend this for anyone who wants to pay alot for a cheap cd player. i just got it yesterday and i don't like it. the sound quality isn't all that great and the way they've made the cd player and the headphones is stupid. the headphones fit very losely so they come out easy and when you listen to it, it fades in and out alot because of it. sure it does have a radio and a lot of other features but it's definitly not worth what you pay for it. so if you don't mind the poor sound quality, it's high price, and the really annoying fading in and out of the headphones than i recommend this cd player for you."
1,HOW LONG DO THE BATTERIES LAST,"HOW MANY HOURS DO THE BATTERIES LAST FOR????????plz disreguard the 1 star rating... it was to draw attention to your eye. i personally never saw this cd player before. for all i know, it could be rated 100 stars"
5,Great Book!,My 3 and a half year old son saw this book on the PBS show Between the Lions and absolutely fell in love with it. I was so excited to find it on Amazon and we have enjoyed reading it over and over....and over again. It's a great book.
5,A family favorite,My kids (all four of them) love this book. And I never minded reading it again and again. I originally found it several years ago on the sale table of a local bookstore and could never find it again. Happy to see it is available. It is a family favorite.
4,The Pickle Has Great Endurance,"Kids love this books and request it time and time again. They seem to appreciate its rollicking quality as silly item after the next joins in the chase. Nary a week goes by at my library branch but what some parent, grandparent or babysitter arrives looking for ""that silly pickle book"" because their young charge has requested it. That is (to quote the book) a pickle of great endurance! Encore!"
2,Disappointing,"This was a gift for our grandaughter....the book was one from a library which still had the return/check out cards attached. It was not as described, to me, regarding the actual condition of the book"
1,more suggestion for this book,"I know someone may think he/she got lots of SOI things from this book. As a pioneer in SOI field, I think this book is too mathematical to describe the spirits of SOI devices. Authors should have derivated most important equations, so readers knowwhat's inside. No one cares about ""inside Intel"", but ""Intel inside""!"
2,good SOI PD model,"I like the chapter discussing PD SOI model. It is too concise forcircuit portion, and hopefully the next version will be better!"
1,"Only good for Research, not for Class","I have over 13 years experience regarding to CMOS device modeling, and circuit design. I strongly don't suggest people to buy this book. This book contains lots of SOI stuffs, but less fundamental concepts. Suggestions: 1. Useful for Research only 2. It's better to read another SOI textbook "" SOI Circuit Design Concepts by Kerry Bernstein, Norman J. Rohrer. first 3. too expensive for this book, we expected 30% off compared to current price. 4. Lots of overlap contents found if you read Kuo's previous textbook. 5.Suggest Prof.Kuo to double check all the chapters if Kuo asked his students to make up this book."
2,What's the point?,"Mr. Schonberger hoists the flag of what he calls 'Customer Focused Principles'- with all due respect to Covey's 'Principles' -and waits to see who salutes. He is still waiting.With much name dropping, plenty of abbreviations - see, I know the jargon, many cited 'conversations' - see I am scholarly, and many random and pointless narratives about various companies - see, I am really scholarly and connected, Mr. Schonberger manages to waste the readers time while managing to obfusticate the principle of Total Quality Management and Lean Manufacturing. I came away from reading the book saying 'So what is the point'."
5,I love this air compressor,"It's quiet (good for indoors) great for air nailers, but also pumps up my motor home's 65psi 16"" tires - although slowly because of the large CFM used. I like the fact that it is light, very portable, and pressures up to 135psi. Pressure regulator works well. Did I mention, you can carry it with one hand, and store it vertically or horizontally?"
2,Great compressor but didn't last,"I purchased this unit to inflate tires on my RV (6 tires at 100 psi each). Since I had the compressor, I used it on the cars and bikes also. Worked great, I loved it, nice compact design, not too heavy, and it doesn't draw too many amps. But after 2.5 yrs, it simply died. Motor couldn't start the compressor against more than 50 psi in the reservoir. Repair shop said the electronic device that adds power during the start of the motor went bad, and it would cost more than a new unit to replace. I contacted DeWalt and asked if they could help, even though the 1-yr warranty is expired, since it had such light use. DeWalt was very nice, but told me I was on my own. I ended up putting this 2.5 yr old unit, like-new, out for the trash. If it will only last 2-1/2 years, I've decided a low-cost unit might be a better deal (e.g., Home Depot's Husky brand)."
1,Poor quality control,"Owned this unit for about an hour before returning it for a refund.I bought this item for two reasons, light weight and low noise. Well the unit is light weight but no quieter then my 10 year old Craftsman 3 gallon unit that requires ear protection to use.As with others that rated this a 1 star, the regulator was faulty. If you backed it off so that the pressure on the tool side of the regulator was 0, the unit would build up pressure until it cut out at 135psi. As soon as you tried to bleed any air into the tool side of the regulator there would be a rush of air and the pressure would drop to 20 psi with the compressor running.I bought the DeWalt unit because I thought they made a quality product. You would think that they would run these unit to make sure they worked before packing them up, I guess I was wrong.At least Amazon makes the return/refund process easy."
1,Be careful about ordering this product....,"Purchased this item for my husband and within one month, the compressor stopped working. To add insult to this matter, it quit working after the time I could return it for a full refund which was only after one month of receiving it!!! I was charged a restocking fee even though we added a note when returning the item that the compressor didn't work. So, this is a warning to anyone who wants to purchase this item that you may receive the faulty one that we returned. Between return shipping fees and restocking fees, we spent an extra $50 on this item."
1,Short duration of service,"I bought this compressor in 2010 from Amazon. Completed the break in process as described. I wanted a compressor to use on home projects primarily operating a brad nailer. The compressor worked well for that purpose while it lasted. I used the compressor a total of 10 times on small wood working projects. The compressor was garage stored. I plugged it in this week to finish the trim work on a built-in entertainment center and the compressor would run but wouldn't build pressure. Checked for leaks, faulty gauges, etc. Discovered the piston was shot. Can't repair these units as they are throw away units. Highly disappointed with the quality of this product. Do not buy this unit."
1,"New compressor leaks, common problem","Turned out to have the same problem that many other reviewers have had. The tank hits 135 PSI and caps, no line pressure. Regulator cap leaks and DeWalt will not service it.Huge pain, since I've just had the time to unpack it after being busy with work, and it's outside of the Amazon return period."
2,did not perform in terms of PSI,"Purchased as a gift for immediate need by a family member. Transaction/delivery (Amazon/UPS) was great. However, the unit would not go much above 30-40 PSI contrary to the 135 psi stated. Unit was returned since it did not perform as stated/needed. Disappointed in the product itself but would use Amazon again."
1,Highly Disappointed,Defective out of the box. Regulator valve leaked and the compressor pump sounded like there was a ball bearing bouncing around in it--otherwise...it had a nice paint job? I am currently returning it and plan on buying a compressor locally and of a different brand.
1,Money wasted.....,"Owned one of these. Used it rarely, it lasted about the equivalent of 4 hours and the motor quit. Before it quit the regulator was failing, I reached for the switch and it made a funny noise and stopped. Never to restart. Nope, this is the third Dewault product I've purchased from Lowes and they'll not get another dime.I took it back and unfortunately it was out of warranty. If they're going to have the Chinese make these things they need to define a QA spec, cause they're just selling junk these days. I've gone back to Ace for my supplies."
3,Great but does not last long,This is a great little compressor to run a finish nailer or brad nailer. I did not see any performance difference between this little guy and my larger 4 gallon stack compressor when running just a single gun. Unfortunately it went completely dead the first day on my second job. I probably only used it about 4 days total. Now I hope the replacement lasts more than 1 month. I really would have gave it 5 stars if it never broke.
3,Broken regulator,"I ordered this because it was on a great sale and I have always been pleased the quality of DeWalt tools. For a small job this compressor might have been a good buy. Light weight and compact, would be good for a trim nailer, or such. I was surprised with how quiet it was. However I was never able to use it. New out of the box the regulator leaked. If air output was set on 0psi it would fill the tank and shut off, but as soon as the output pressure was raised the air just leaked out, and compressor would run no stop, unable to catch up and fill the tank to the shutoff pressure. I called DeWalt and was told it was a defective item and I should return for a replacement. I chose to just return the item and look for a larger compressor that I could just leave setup in my garage."
4,Dewalt Compressor,"We like the fact that it is small, easy to carry and still powerful enough to get the job done."
2,Possibly good for home garage...,"Read carefully that this is a ""trim"" gun and NOT a ""Framing"" gun compressor. I had two framers tacking trusses together and this compressor burned itself up in less that two hours on the job. Think long and hard about a gas powered(Honda) compressor (Rolair for example) if you need any volume of usage. Yes you'll spend three times as much, however, it will not let you down... Typically atleast.Regards, Matt Garrett."
3,Very irritated,Tire on my car was slack so was very excited to use my New air compressor. Opened the box. And discovered that it can't be used because there are NO HOSES OR ATTACHMENTS!
1,Came Broken....,"The regulator adjustment knob is leaking air like crazy. And I need to buy a replacement kit for $30 bucks. Like what the F@#$%^ Amazon???So, it looks like it might work really good...Update:I opened up the regulator knob and adjusted the o-ring inside of it - which prolly had gotten knocked loose during shipping or manufacturing. Then I let the unit run, while gently fiddling with the knob. Then after 5 minutes the knob stopped leaking and the tank started to build up pressure.So it works. Just annoying to buy sh#@ and have to fix it before using it."
4,Dewalt d55140 1 gallon compresser,The compressor shipped quickly and arrived promptly. It came in it's original carton with postage info stuck to the side. It was undamaged and assembled quickly.The air pressure gauge cover popped off almost at once but popped back on with no problem. This unit runs very quietly. Pumps up fast. Little awkward to carry and works best strapped to a hand truck or dolly. A good over all purchase.
1,"Worked for 12 hours, Dewalt won't stand behind it","Really liked the compressor at first. Used it very little and gave it excellent care. It quite working after about 12 hours of use. Dewalt will not help to diagnose the problem. Made in China not America like the other Emglo compressors. Dewalt service is non-existent. I am done with Dewalt tools because I have had similar problems with their cordless tools and portable planer as well. They have a nice paint job but are homeowner grade, not professional grade tools. They do have a professional price tag."
1,Poor workmanship,"Got this compressor as a Christmas present. Really like the light weight and size. Hooked it up and broke it in as per instructions. Very quite unit. When I pressurized the line, it leaked air quickly. Called customer service and they said it was most likely the pressure regulator and offered to mail me one. However, I opted to take it to the local Dewalt Service Center for repairs. After 2 weeks, I checked on status and was told they were awaiting parts. At 4 weeks, I called and was told they didn't know if or when they would get the parts in. So I picked it up and returned it to Amazon. No problems in the return. When the factory service center can't get the parts, it is not a piece of equipment I want to own."
4,Great low noise compressor,"This compressors is small compared to other compressors, and for basic use it is a must. It is very quiet and his a built in quick connect switch is cool for those who like to switch out tools. The regulator is decent but takes some getting use to. All in all it is a great basic use compressor. One side note, the compressor comes in a box with no real packing foam to cushion it so inspect it other than that its a great buy."
4,Good as advertised,The compressor is good as advertised for trim and doing a few framing nails - not for constant multiple nailing - very light weight and easy to carry.
3,"Dear, Wendy Carlos;","A question for Wendy Carlos is in order. I have just re-read a 32 page article and interview given to her by Carol Wright some years ago via telephone.Will Ms. Carlos provide some audio clips for us to gain an earfull of intrigue, if i can say that. Thank You :)"
3,Good condition,"Label appeared to be like a bootleg, but the condition was okay and the quality of the sound was good."
4,Great system but doesn't like bad weather.,"This Directv system is wonderful. You can have access to all cable channels, also local channels through the same dish antenna without having to spend extra money for another dish. Also, going from one channel to another is very rapid compared to the other big company. But there is one thing that is not that great: if you live in a place where there is a lot of big storms, the signal will fade and eventually, you'll lose the signal for a few minutes. The samething will happen if you have a snow build up on the dish antenna. But besides that, the Directv RCA system is wonderful. Great value, sound and image!"
5,Great Product!,"This is a great system! I would reccomend it to anyone interested in purchasing a DSS system. I bought the dual LNB system (system with the satellite dish and 2 receivers) at Wal-Mart for a great price of $199.96. Radio Shack charges $149 for just the dish and 1 receiver. There is only one thing bad about it (and all sytems) if you want to add more receivers you have to buy another receiver and also have to purchase a special digital satellite splitter (to run the cable to different rooms of your home, because a regular splitter doesn't work correctly) which runs from $50-$200. Which I had to buy to add a 3rd receiver. It was a little tricky finding just a receiver and not the whole sytem, but I did it. But overall, this is a great buy, and I would reccomend it to anyone looking for a DSS system."
4,"excellent all around, but make sure you ....",System has superior picture. But beware you have a clear path to the satellite (the one in the sky).Trees and wind will severely hamper or completely knock out your reception. I have even lost reception with just clouds! P.S. NFL Sunday Ticket ! Probably the reason you will buy it. I did.
3,Decent debut and coming of age book,"""Beijing Doll"" reads like the diary of an indecisively boy-crazy teenage girl . Unlike the average youth diarist, however, Chun Sue wrote for music magazines early in her high school career in order to pursue a personal passion and to draw her away from her oppressively strict high school environs. A rock music addict who embraced and wrote about the Beijing punk rock scene, Chun Sue depicts much teenage angst and moodiness in ""Beijing Doll,"" but seemingly fails to grow out of it. Her voice is fickle in the book, but supported with spurts of vague determination and personal strength. Overall, a decent debut and coming-of-age book by a young writer; any later efforts should be more substantial."
1,Disappointing,"This was a disappointingly unoriginal account of ""teenage angst""...another memoir of a privileged youth with no parental guidance and too much free time to sulk around.I'm all for this genre, but this book was totally cliche."
2,Confusing and overated.,I remember hearing about the book in a magazine and then seeing in the book store for 14 dollars. I didn't want to spend that much money so I waited. I'M GLAD I WAITED! until my library got it. I expected the story to be very emotional and inciteful. Reading the story I found to be confusing with all these friends and how the story jumps from one thing to the next without anything inbetween. I felt there was no real ending rather the story just stopped. I wondered throughout reading Beijing Doll if it was the translation that was off rather than the story.Overall made me depressed.
2,Yuck,"I just finished reading this and I don't know whether to feel sorry for the author or disgusted. The word that comes up for me is ""apathetic"". Everything and everyone in the book is apathetic. Chun Sue goes to bed with so many men/boys in this story and not once is there any mention of pleasure either for herself or for the males. There isn't any real point to the story and it is like an extended diary. Also, she must have come from a pretty well off family as she always had money, her parents let her get away with everything and do everything she wanted with no consequences (oh, her father did throw something at her but neither parent plays a part in the book). I get the feeling that this is Chun's world and everyone else in it doesn't matter or is just there to amuse her. Not recommended and I'm not keeping my copy of it."
4,Beijing Doll,"This book was okay. She reminded me of myself. It's basically written like a journal, except with dates and all that. If you like those kinds of stories then you'll probably like this book. It was a little hard keeping track of all the guys and who they were to her. And some you don't know how she met."
1,A BIG Disappointment,"If there was ever a book that I absolutely disliked, it WAS Beijing Doll. Like the other reviews, I too, agree that this book was totally cliche as well as confusing. Books should show some relation and emotion, but I found Beijing Doll to be flat. I read it on a plane on my way to Disney World for laughs, but I barely laughed; instead, there was a frown plastered on my face for the most part.Reviewer's Warning: Do NOT read for enjoyment unless you're ready to stumble over Chinese Words and unresolvable instances."
4,Different,Very different kind of biography than what I'm used to reading. I felt I had a good sense of what's going on in her head but its not as exciting as I thought it would be. Its a bit grunge.
2,"Mmmm, not so sure about this one.","This book is ""choppy"" and that makes it difficult to read. It really doesn't hold the readers attention and takes a huge amount of discipline to actually get through it...almost like when you watch a bad movie that starts very slow and you keep telling yourself: ""It will get better soon, so I'll keep watching"", but before you know it, the movie is over and no, it never improved.This book had potential but fell short in my expectations."
1,One of the wrost books Ive ever read.,"I hated this book.I read it because the summary made the book sound amazing.The summary said that Bejing Doll was about sex,drugs and rock in underground china. The book `s summary should have been ""read about a spoiled chinese loser as she waste her life and parents money"" with "" very little rock music metioned"""
4,A Quick and Fulfilling Read,"Chun Sue's autobiographical novel reads quickly and is chock full of teenage angst. There's no BS here; it is straightforward, raw, and unforgiving. Although it is sometimes rushed and confusing and one can easily mix up the names of her lovers, it is completely worth reading. The ending is a bit of a disappointment, it seems that Chun Sue had more to say and was a bit abrupt in her conclusion.Try it out, you just might like it."
1,bad,"I bought this item in good faith that it was in very good shape as said.it was not as said, it didn't play good then stopped working all together. i dont recommend this seller"
4,Replacement,"This was a replacement for the same one I had for years. Works great. Once in a while it gets a buzz in there, but hanging it upright again seems to eliminate it. Has kept time perfect so far."
4,easier,"was looking for the ML44T, but it was $46, ML88T was $29 and can run 2 sets of lights, no-brainer, now I have an extra ML44T in case something goes wrong on the other one's"
5,Malibu light timer,Received the product in a timely manner. Product works great and was very easy to install.
4,Noisy but works great,"I would not want this inside or anywhere near my house. It sounds like it is resisting a ton of electricity. As if it is getting super hot and will catch fire.Now, it isn't hot and hasn't caught fire. I'm just trying to explain the humm and what it sounds like to me...if you worry about this type of thing, I would skip this. I'm wondering if this is rip off of the real product sold at Home Depot/Lowes..because my old one did not hum at all.It's been working great for me, about 50 feet from my house for my driveway lights."
1,Malibu Failure,The Malibu outdoor light power pack did not work when I got it. I had thrown the box away so I couldn't return it. It was a piece of junk.
2,"Poor design, not very good quality","We purchased this item to replace a similar unit in which the timer had failed. What we recently discovered is that the timer does NOT control the power to the transformer. The timer controls the low voltage output to the lights; which may put less stress on the timer, but otherwise is unsatisfactory. The transformer hum is much louder than the previous unit. Our timer is located in the front hall closet which should prolong the life of the unit, but the transformer hums day and night, no matter whether the timer is on or off. This is not only irritating is also not efficient from an energy-saving perspective. We should have paid more for a better model."
4,Adequate replacement,"I was needing an acceptable replacement for my Toro low voltage transformer which is no longer available. After checking several Internet sources I determined that the Intermatic probably would work the best. It is quite a bit larger than the Toro original and comes with instructions that are not as clear as they could be, but all in all an acceptable alternative and seems to be working as I had hoped."
5,Good Replacement,"I bought this powerpack as a replacement. They are easy to change out and, it beats setting up a new box of lights. Keep in mind that these transformers don't last forever. They last about five years, and then the timer goes or they will start to hum. In my case, it was both."
5,Great replacement!,"We bought this as a replacement when our old power pack quit working. The lights all worked fine, just needed the power pack. It was delivered fast and easy to install. We were very happy to have our lights working again. The old one lasted over 10 years, so it's a great product."
2,Only lasted 2 years,"I bought this as a new, separate 88 watt unit along with 5 separate lights (which only totaled 50 watts). The installation was simple enough and worked well but it would get pretty warm to the touch. The timer portion only lasted 2 years."
3,Intermatic ML88T Power Pack,I had to return the power pack 2 times to get a new power pack that work. The first one had a broken timer wheel that would not engage the timer switches to turn-on/turn-off the transformer. The second one had a broken Timer wheel that would not turn as the time progress. The third Power-Pack work fine. Amazon did an excellent job to accept the 2 defective new Power-Packs and get me a replacement.
5,Great Product,This is a very good product and hard to find. Good price also.The last one I had lasted over 8 years.
4,Malibu landscape lighk transformer / timer,"I received the Malibu power pack/ timer in 4 tays from order. It workes great. I replaced an old Malibu timer (about 15 years old) with this unit. The new one is very quiet, no hum."
1,Tijmer can't keep time,"I purchased this 88 watt Intermatic 12v low voltage transformer to replace an identical unit from Malibu that gave up the ghost after 15 years. Unfortunately, the new Intermatic power pack can not keep accurate time. Every day I reset the timer to the correct time, the unit would be off by 4 hours or more the following day. I tried setting the timer for several days in a row and it never kept time accurately. Deemed unit defective and returned for a refund."
3,Works so far.,"I ordered this for an elderly customer as a replacement. It installed easily and worked like it was supposed to. The only complaint my customer had, was that the switch pins were to small and she was affraid of losing them when she changed the time. The pins are small and can be a bit of a pain, but for the price,and the fact you don't mess with the pins very often its very workable. Plus I found a place to order new pins if they do get lost( sorry no link).Bottom line, I would recommend this product."
5,Plug compatible,"I bought this to replace a 44 watt timer/transformer. I removed the 2 wires from my old timer, attached them to my new timer and everything works great."
4,"It works, as advertised.",I purchased the ML88T to replace a previous power pack that had stopped working after 5 years. No problem. It works just fine.
3,????,Bought timer installed it found out we have some wiring issues buried we have to work out first..As soon as the ground thaws out !
5,best price --quality,"this was absolutely the best price anywhere,packed well, very fast shipping--not a very technical item,either works or doesn't, so i was after price, and it was by far the best deal."
3,The movie is better,"Wow, they really amped up the fantastical nature of this story for the movie, didn't they? Granted, it's been a while since I've seen it, but I remembered something a little harder to believe and a little less mundane. The only two instances that seemed familiar were Edward's encounter with the ""giant"" and meeting the two-headed woman. Otherwise, this mostly sad and philosophical tale focuses more about Edward's relationship with his son, our narrator. The question is still whether Edward's stories are made up, but an extra level is added, seemingly implying the stories might have been made up by William, the son, instead. Still, an interesting meditation on the relationship between father and son, both of which would like for the son to see the father as larger-than-life, a Great man, a Big Fish."
3,Ok....,"This book was okay. For anybody that has already seen the movie, the book isn't quite as good. I know that in most cases, the book is always better than the movie, but not in this case. A little on the boring side, in my opinion. Awesome movie, not so awesome book."
5,BIG FISH - Excellent condition & shipping,"At the wonderful prices, I was able to help a local charter high school complete their inventory of this year's required novel."
1,The One That Got Away,I picked up this book because of the hoopla surrounding the movie. I was very disappointed and have not been able to make myself finish it.
3,Quick and simple...,"I love the blurry line between reality and whatever lies beyond it in this book, but ultimately, I expected more from it. It kept coming close to really revealing some truth, some closure, but never did. I enjoyed it thoroughly, but when I was done (in a few hours) it was too easy to put down and not think about anymore.Having lost my father when I was 3, I tend to be drawn to these types of books that explore the father/son relationship, but ultimately often find them confusing, having no point of reference to tap into the feelings there."
3,Big Fish,"This is a wonderful book describing the complexities of the relationships between parents and their children. It details the results of a childhood lived in the absense of a father. The father, Edward Bloom is a psychopath of sorts with his compulsive lying and evasive techniques used in conversation with his son. These psychopath tendencies create a whimsical tell tale-like facade. A life that young William slowly learns to accept and embrace as the essence of his father. This story is both poignant and humorous. It lacks a strong story line, which can both the novel's down fall and orignality. Wallace's whimisical mythical writing is a definite plus creating a fairytale sense."
1,Not What. I Expected,"This paperback book was ordered as new. However when I received it, it looked like it had been damp at some point in time.The paperback was not in what I would consider new condition."
4,Beyond belief and yet completely grounded in reality,"In this story of stories within a story, the reader is taken to strange places that may seem all too familiar. A character seems ridiculous and then is someone you already knew. And events that never happened - that could never happen - are suddenly remembered to have taken place. In short, the author takes the reader far away from reality to reflect upon the here and now."
4,tall tales sound better than the truth.,"I first decided to read Big Fish because I had seen previews for the movie. I didn't even know there was a book before the movie. I just so happened to land across it when I was visiting my local Borders book store. When I saw the book, I decided to buy it. I got glued into the story and couldn't put it down. All the different tales from Edward Bloom's life left me wanting to hear more and more about this man's life. He truly was a Big Fish, and his son William finally saw that in his father's dying days. Maybe sometimes when all we want to hear is the truth, we realize that the tall tales were actually better in the end."
4,A good read.,"I read this book because I heard Tim Burton was directing the movie. If I hadn't known he was directing it, I would never have picked him for it. This book is far from a typical Tim Burton story-there's very little darkness, certainly nothing macabre. This short novel is the story of a dying man told through the eyes of his son. A tall tale. The book illustrates well the warped (often in a good way) perception sons have of their fathers-as mythic heroes. The book is basically a collection of fantastic incidents, the myths of the father's life. Breaking up these chapters are several versions of the actual death of the father, which the son writes and re-writes. It's in these chapters that you get to know the complicated feelings of the son toward a father who was never completely straight, always hiding behind jokes and fables. It's a good, touching story. Read it before you see the movie if you can, but it's worthwhile afterward too."
4,Better than expected.,"After having watched the movie, I decided it was absolutely necessry to read the book. Sadly, I was expecting the movie all over again and thus was disappointed by the beginning of the book. Not until a few chapters did I realize that I needed to respect the book as a whole different piece of art. Once I did, I was amazed.Wallace has amazing talent to portray many ideas and feelings with few words. The book is more like a long short story. However, it is a fabulous short story. Many ideas are repeated each time taking a different view on the situation.Although ultimately there is no great conclusion, no great accomplishment at the end of the book, the story in itself is such a great accomplishment. It's a feel-good book, with many unhappy thoughts that are interpretted as extremely soothing. This is the magic of Daniel Wallace.This is another quick read, and definitely worth the time."
2,"Never said this before, but not as good as the movie","I don't know what the problem was, but I just didn't see how this was a readable book, good thing it was short 'cause I nearly quit it, maybe I should have. I just thought the book wasn't concieved near as much as the movie was, it seemed that Tim Burton put more fore-thought in the movie than Mr. Wallace did in his book. Now I did like the conflict between father and son and how this is resolved in the father's own special way, but besides that I didn't care much for the book. Now I loved the movie on the other hand, and thought it was excellent, best movie I'd seen in a while."
4,Magical...,"What a cool book! I can't wait to see the movie now. This book is full of tall tales and such wonderful imagination, I'm really looking forward to seeing how it's played out on the big screen. I definitely recommend this book if you haven't already seen the movie...or even if you have."
3,See the film before you read the book,"My first review of this book said to read it before you see the film. That is because that is how I always feel about books in general because I am more of a reader than a film addict....although I passionately love both. When I saw this film, it made me wish that I had not been expecting all the quirky images that were in the story. Sometimes things are better left to the eye rather than the page. And seeing as Tim Burton did the story telling, you know you are in excellant hands. So I retract my statement about reading this book before you see the film. I was PAINFULLY wrong. See the film, be enchanted and then read the book to really get the rhythm and backround of the characters. I stand corrected and I am sorry. Whoops."
4,Big stuff in a small package,"I started and finished this little book on Sunday morning, and I've thought about it all day. This is an interesting story that is sure to get you thinking about your relationship with your own dad, whether or not he's still living. Short snippets of the father's life are recalled by his son, intertwined with fun chapters that show dad's insistence that he tell jokes to his dying day. These will draw you in and propel you forward. And there's one scene which is cleverly brought back a few times throughout the book and fine-tuned until the end. The final chapters are wonderful and will fill you up with emotion. What a nice book to read in one sitting...but I recommed you leave time for reflection about your own life with your dad as well."
3,Sorta fun,"I had seen and enjoyed the movie Big Fish, for its sheer quirkiness if nothing else, which is how I came to pick up this book. Although I liked the book overall, the stories were choppy instead of woven together, and I had to force myself to keep picking the book up to finish instead of moving on to something else. I might feel differently had I not seen th movie first, but, alas, too late for that."
4,Not bad,"I bought the book for a school assignment and it arrived fairly promptly, although I ordered it too late and I didn't need it anymore by the time I received it. The product itself was handled well, with minimally bent corners and almost unnoticeable scuffs. No pages were marked or bent. Overall, I was very satisfied.Plus, the book itself isn't so bad."
3,A Tall Tale With a Sentimental Undertone,"Let me preface by saying that this is not my typical genre so my review may be clouded by that fact. This book is a collection of stories that form the man, Edward Bloom, a never serious traveling salesman. The book is told from his son's perspective as his Father lay on his death bed. While the stories were sometimes entertaining and humorous, they seemed disconnected. The ending, while a bit far fetched (staying with the whole tone of the book) did serve to drive one point home to Mr. Bloom's son: That the jokes and stories that made up his impressions of his Father, the ones that he grew to resent, in the end became the manner in which his Father communicated with the people in his life."
3,"For once, I like the movie more",I have to agree with the other reviewers who felt that this was the rare instance where the movie was better than the book. The story in the book just didn't seem to flow as well as the movie. This does not mean that this was a bad book. Perhaps I would have rated this book higher if I hadn't seen the movie first. It is still an excellent story.
2,Great fun; our first one cracked on the first use,"GOOD NEWS:This is a great ""Frisbee-replacement."" It weighs less for younger hands and travels far. And there are many spaces in between the fabric for little fingers to catch it--so its more satisfying to play with.BAD NEWS: Ours was a gift from Los Angeles, and the plastic frame--underneath the fabric--cracked in two places the first time we played with it. (We were out on the street in front of the house and it mustve happened when it hit the road.) We still play with it but you can't throw it ""on level"" as we used to..."
3,"Sound advice, tacky production","I deeply appreciate Wayne Dyer's way of looking at life and I am sure that I'm healthier because of his insights. I was, however, very disappointed by the production quality of this CD set. It seems like someone casually spliced together segments from various talks and interviews, paying no attention to sound quality and only modest attention to the overall flow of the production. To make matters worse, my set had 2 copies of CD #2 and none of #3. :-( I liked other Wayne Dyer books much better than this one."
4,Good start to inner peace.,I enjoyed listening the author concerning this topic. It was initially hard to understand the authors concept of showing love and forgiving that it will come back to you with interest. The audio cd seemed to be meshed together from live and personnel interviews. At first the cd seemed non-consistent although as you listen understand better the concept and content the break in the cds were ignored. The authored repeats himself on many occasions as I think it is to emphasize his ideas in different contexts.The last cd it the most insightful although you need to listen to the first 3 cds to understand what the author is talking about. Although if you get an understanding of inner peace then you need to listen to the last 2 cds over and over again. It really helps an individual understand the need of forgiveness and inner peace.Enjoy the audio!
1,my thoughts and mine alone.,"poor work...hard to believe he's actually successful at this. again, this is one of his early productions."
3,Not all happy synth tunes,"This 2nd Talk Talk CD has a reputation of being shimmery 80s synth-pop, but while the genius single It's My Life, certainly could be described this way, the majority of the album is slow, moody tracks that aren't anyone's idea of party music. Even singles like Such A Shame and Dum Dum Girl are a bit on the dreary side.Good songs, but it lacks cohesion and doesn't work as a complete listening experience. The tracks just don't gel with each other."
2,Buy the remastered import CD instead,"This is a great album. The two-star rating is for the fact that this is the 1990 CD release, not the recent remastered version. I have no idea why the remastered version of this album is not available on a domestic label, but It's A Shame. The remaster sounds noticeably better. There is much cleaner separation of the instruments. And it's not that expensive. Buy it instead at this link:It's My Life"
5,"A wonderful album, showing incredible growth, still fresh after all these years","I love Talk Talk. They are an enigma to me--how could a band who put out a competent and well composed but ultimately not especially original album like their first album suddenly make a leap forward like this? And how did they get from here to their ultimate magnum Opus Spirit of Eden? (Laughing Stock is amazing, but I don't enjoy it quite as much as SoE). I'm not sure. This album still manages to enchant me even after all these years. Renee is simply searing in its agony, and It's My Life is a classic of the New Wave. I'm not sure what to make of Dum Dum Girl, but it is infectious enough that I sing it in my head. Anyway, a great album for fans of the New Wave, but I implore you, if you are investigating Talk Talk, don't give up before you get to the end of their output. Then check out Mark Hollis' eponymous solo album--also great."
5,New age by definition,"There is no better way to describe what New Age is than listening to this outstanding recording. Not only is the pure essence of New Age: I'm talking about real quality, inspiration and soul.For those who think this music is over-programmed, Ciani has that latin sense that makes her music pure, lively, fresh and with the touch of innocence of her first recordings.I will mention Tuscany as one of my favourite songs of all music I've ever heard: melancholic is the word.Neverland together with Hotel Luna are the best way to introduce to this artist and to this genre which had no equal in late 80's and first 90's."
3,"Great show, poor packaging","As much as I enjoy the episodes from Season One, I have to knock two stars off my rating and give this DVD set only three stars because of its poor packaging. The set contains four discs and in order to fit all 21 episodes and bonus materials on them, the producers have chosen to use the flip side of the discs.In addition to the inconvenience of not having continuous viewing, I also worry about the long-term care of these discs, which would seem to be more vulnerable to normal wear and tear.Had I known that both sides of the discs were used before I purchased the set, I would have reconsidered my purchase."
4,Great show but.........,"Show is great, actors are great, plot is great, double sided disks should be canceled. I have had to return Seasons 1 through 3 to the store and get replacement disks. They were scratched or had major flaws in them that affected play. Fox should be ashamed of double sided disks for such a great show. Called them twice and found that they don't care. In fact, the first time, they hung up on me. Said that we must have gotten disconnected. Tried e-mailing them and because I didn't buy them from Fox's website, I couldn't e-mail them. Please Fox. Get rid of double sided disks. Or at least get somebody who knows how to burn them correctly."
5,Clever Storyline,"Michael Weiss is the PRETENDER! Great Show, acting, clever storyline. All the above.The DVD is nicely transfered. A welcomed addition to my DVD library"
3,One of the better American TV shows,"What's neat about this show is that it shows the difference that can be made in the lives of others when someone corrects an injustice. That is unusual on American TV. The acting and variegated nature of the stories in the various chapters also work well. However, there is a theme that repeats itself ad infinitum of the main character fleeing his captors, doing good, then fleeing again, which becomes a bit much. For 4+ star shows, please see my reviews of selected other American and British TV series. Cheers!"
4,on DVD... at last!,"I was very excited to finally get the first season on DVD. I live in France so I had it imported from the US. ""mking of"" featurettes and TV spots included are always a plus.Too bad there are only 4 discs that you need to play both sides!"
5,The best TV series you've ever known,"I watched ""the pretender"" on TV and I loved that series.It's about a guy who was stolen by an organization named The Centre when he was a child. He escaped when he recognized that The Centre abused him. And he started to help people who are in danger.Maybe this dosen't sound really interesting to you, but you're wrong. It's really, really great."
1,INCORRECT DISC - Cannot be read-UNWATCHABLE,"THESE DISCS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DOUBLE-SIDED, ACCORDING TO THE PACKAGING LABEL. DISC 1, SIDE 1 HAS 4 EPISODES, SIDE 2 HAS 4 EPISODES, DISC 2, THE SAME. My DVD player gives me the same message for both discs, ""Incorrect Disc-C104"" Side One plays properly, side two, not at all. Which means that I have only half of the episodes. And I bought the series too long ago to be able to return or even replace it.My suggestion: I don't care how busy you are, watch it immediately so that if there is a problem, you can return it and NOT waste your money.The Pretender - The Complete First Season"
2,Great Content! (loved the show) Bad disc.,"I have ordered the season one two different times and each time, disc one, side two would not play. Is anyone else having the same problem?On my last request for a new one, Amazon said,""I'm sorry to hear that you experienced the same problem with your replacement shipment.As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement.""However, I do notice that they still have them in stock. But maybe they want me to purchase it at a higher price than I originally purchased it for? Bad Amazon...very Bad!"
5,THE GREAT PRETENDER,I FORGOT WHAT A GREAT SHOW THIS WAS SURE THE ACTING IS A LITTLE BIT ON THE HAMMY SIDE BUT I THINK ITS PART OF THE CHARM OF THE SHOW IT GIVES IT A RETRO FEEL ANYWAY I'M GOING TO GET THE NEXT SERIES WOO HOO CANT WAIT
5,One of the Best Series Ever,"This was one of my favorite shows. I followed the Pretender as it moved from station to station until it finally disappeared. I always wished I could have a copy of some of the episodes but finally gave up. I explained the premise of the show to another friend, and they found it had just been released. This was definitely one of the best gifts ever. I'm glad they finally released it. This show was a classic. While there was a certain level of predictability in each episode there were still enough twists and sub-plots to keep the show interesting. You don't just follow a detective/action hero, instead you follow a child searching for his place in life and experiencing new things along the way. This collection includes my favorite episode, ""Better Part of Valor,"" which involves Jarod investigating the death of a firefighter in a warehouse fire. This show really is one of the greatest. I hope they will release the remaining episodes."
5,One Of My Favorite TV Shows Of All Time,"This show revolves around Jarod, a genius that was kidnapped by an organization known as ""The Centre"" when he was a child. This organization exploited his genius for their own purposes and financial gains. Later, as an adult, Jarod escapes from ""The Centre"" and sets out on a mission to help others, through his ability impersonate different jobs and occupations. He also searches to find the family that he was taken from as a child. Miss Parker, Sydney and Broots lead ""The Centre's"" search for Jarod, hoping to eventually recapture him and return him to ""The Centre"".This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time. I am excited that they have finally begun releasing this series on DVD and I can't wait for the next seasons to be released. Excellent show. Interesting, captivating plot and well acted."
5,The most amazing series on television,"I bought this DVD because I was a fan of the Pretender when it originally aired, and I'm ashamed to say I'd nearly forgotten just how good it was. This show has everything to keep you entertained. Jarod is the super-intelligent (yet clueless in so many ways, especially in the early seasons) hero, Sydney is the not-quite-good-or-evil father-figure, and Miss Parker is the dangerious hunter who is determined to get Jarod back into the Centre.. The last place on earth he wants to go.It's no wonder fans of this show are currently campaigning for a third Pretender movie.. Once you start watching you just can't get enough! Buy this DVD (and the Season 2 release!), you won't be disappointed!"
3,Not the best of her books,"This books is interesting, and has funny moments, but seems to be a less funny version of some of her prior books. I got the ebook, and found myself wishing I had gotten the hard copy instead so that I could have donated it to the library, which isn't the way I feel about ""At Knits End"" which is great and I find myself going back to again and again. If you are looking for a series of short knitting stories, some of which are funny (but several of which will be familiar to you from other Pearl-McPhee books), and don't mind this one not being as fresh or funny, then enjoy. Otherwise choose one of her other books, like At Knits End if you want a great series of 1 page notes which are hysterical, or Free Ranger Knitter which isn't as funny as At Knits End, but is a good series of short stories that you might find yourself wanting to read again."
5,Great book,"I use this book during our 2-hour prayer shawl ministry. As we knit, I'll read excerpts from this book 2 to 3 times while we are knitting, sometimes humerous and sometimes great tips. It's a great book. The author writes with humor and gives wonderful tips."
5,Great book addressing the most important resource available when confronted with sudden violence - the mind!,"I enjoyed the author's ability to address the psychological aspects of combat which are seldomly addressed in self defense books or manuals. The book leaves the ethical questions to be dealt with by pastors and philosophers and focuses on the mind set that must be adopted to win a life or death struggle. I found the book an easy read with the feel of a combat savvy uncle conveying to his nephew real world attitudes and techniques to survive a violent attack. While not a step by step instructional manual, it focuses on key concepts and attitudes that are required to survive outside of the sparing arena."
3,Not at all like seeing them live,"I am a HUGE BNL fan. I've seen them live numerous times & never been disappointed. What makes BNL special is their live shows. Ad libs, changing lyrics, funning jokes. These aren't well represented on this CD. Great songs, but not the best extended versions. See them live, then you'll understand."
4,"Not Anything Special Here, but still, it's BNL","I'm a bit of a Barenaked Ladies collector, and hey, this was cheap. It's some live recordings of the band from several East Coast shows. Good quality recordings, but, honestly, not a lot of the ""spark"" you'll find by actually attending one of their live shows. Good music, but I've heard it before."
2,I love BNL but...,"I'm an avid Barenaked Ladies fan, but was disappointed by this CD.Having attended several live shows, I expected this CD to include some of their ""Interludes"" that they are known to have mid-song. This had none of that... just a short sampling of their songs done live with mediocre sound quality.It was worth $5 to have another BNL CD to add to my collection... but as far as listening to it, there is a MUCH better selection out there that captures the essence of a live show."
3,"What's so ""extended"" about it?","Sure, I like the songs. I have them on the original studio CDs. I was hoping that this live CD would have more of the banter and odd interludes that the 'Ladies insert when they're in concert, but really, these sound mostly like live copies of the originals without much interesting and new. (Exception: ""Enid"" has never sounded better. The imitation of the trumpets and harmonies are really nice.)"
4,"Good, but nothing special","Basically it's just the guys live for some tracks. If you are a big fan, you'll enjoy it, but for casual fans, you most likely won't.If you want REALLY good live stuff, I'd check out Rock Spectacle CD, Barelaked Nadies DVD, and the new Talk To the Hand Live In Michigan DVD and CD (which is the best out of them, and is directed beautifully. The closest to feeling like you are there!)So if you need to add more to your BNL collection, get it. If you want a great live show, get Talk To the Hand."
5,The ladies never let you down!,"As with all BNL cds, this one delivers. The guys perform the classics with a fresh take every time and this album is no different. Buy it. Listen to it. Love it. ;)"
4,Good purchase - Highly Recommend,Les Brown is a great speaker when you need that push to get you going. It doesn't tell you exactly what you are supposed to do in life but it teaches you how to make decisions. I highly recommend this product.NKHomeSecurity.comwww.NKHomeSecurity.com
3,"Not my favorite, but still good","Lily On The Beach, while not my favorite TD album, is still very good. Their sound has changed and evolved so much throughout their career and some people have a difficult time accepting that change. Then again, if the band had not changed their sound over the years, those same people would probably have complained that TD had grown stagnant and repetitive. I purchased this CD to help complete my collection. IMHO, TD is the greatest band ever formed. Their music is surreal, like an abstract painting done with music rather than paint, brushes, and canvas.""All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.""TD for life!!!!"
3,Well...,"I can't really say this is is my favorite TD album but it isn't the worst either (that might be Rockoon, or Turn of the Tides, or both). The music in Lily on the Beach is in the pretty generic 90's TD style that would permeate nearly all of their later releases. But not all is lost, I think. Although the last tracks were plain bad and Desert Drive is just some shortened and up-beat Marakesh (from Optical Race) rip-off with some tweaks here and there, there is also a great Froese guitar solo on Too hot for my Chinchilla (the best track in the album, I think), and some interesting musical explorations on Mount Shasta and Crystal Curfew.It's not bad, just plainly generic and doesn't show anything truly representative of the classic Tangerine Dream. If you are a TD newbie, I'd recommend you to first listen the albums from the 73-88 era (in chronological order, if possible); then, and only then, you can give this one a try."
4,A nice surprise.,"Before I bought this CD I was afraid I wouldn't like it.It isn't otherworldly like Tangerine Dreams early work, but it stands on its own. Very nice, very mellow. I guess you can't keep a good band down."
5,Dare to Prepare,When I considered preparing for hurricane season I thought of the present economy and the possibility of the collapse of the Euro and possibility of going back on the gold standard. I needed to find out what i'm missing other than food and water for three days after a hurricane. Dare to prepare allowed me to prepare to not only save my family but those neighbors who had never taken it to the next level. Dare to prepare takes you from the basement of prepping to the penthouse in thinking. A must read for those who care about family and friends.
3,Solid but not great,"This is a solid introduction to disaster preparedness written by someone who walks the walk. There is a lot of information in this book that is helpful but it defiantly has its downfalls. My 2010 edition has a lot of typographical errors and many formatting issues. While that does not detract from information presented it does create confusion at times. May of the charts that could be very useful were rendered extremely confusing until you figured out what they are supposed to say. Much of the information in this book can be found on the internet for free by reading some of the LDS preparedness material, but the book did bring up some points that I had not thought of previously. All in all, this book is pretty good, but the price tag of $48 that I paid was not worth it. Save some money and read up on the internet instead."
5,An Oldie but Goodie!!!!,"Great salsa music...this is one of the CDs in my collection that I seem to always reach for. One word of caution though, if you have several other Rey Ruiz CDs, they tend to all have the same sound. However, if I had to choose one, this would be it. ENJOY!"
1,"Short, no information dvd","I was expecting a documentary about Gaea, but what I received was a slide show of pictures with music in the background. There was no information in the video. This DVD was a total waste of time and money."
5,Born Knowing on my kindle,I loved this book. John has a very easy and convincing way of writing. The content was amazing and was a confirmation to me of messages that we have received from our son who was murdered nearly five years ago. I just wish he would come out here to South Africa. He has a true gift.
3,"ITS NOT A BAD BOOK, BUT ITS NOT GREAT EITHER","This isn't a bad book, but its not great either. Its mildly interesting.A far better book on basicly the same subject is John Edward's ONE LAST TIME. ONE LAST TIME has significantly more depth, more substance and offers more insight into the evolution of a psychic medium and the medium's work. I highly recommend ONE LAST TIME. Edward's book CROSSING OVER is good too, though, I felt not as good as ONE LAST TIME.BORN KNOWING does not offer the insight and substance. The writing, at times, is fairly trite. But again, I bought it and read it and was glad I did."
5,Enlightening,"I found John's words full of comfort and hope. This is a tender and concisely written biography on the ""inside"" of a medium's evolution, from catching glimpses of lights and warm faces in his bedroom as a child in Boston to attending Authur Findlay College in Britian and eventually landing an appearance on ""Unsolved Mysteries.""I've read George Anderson's books and found that John's is just as engaging if not more, as he writes with a refreshingly candid innocense and color. He includes exercises to develop your own psychic abilities. (We all are born with a sixth sense but lose touch.)Thank you for having the courage to share your gift, John! I look forward to seeing you in Seattle."
5,"A Satisfying, Entertaining Read!","John Holland has hit a home run with this book, his first. John is a medium - someone able to communicate with the dead. In this book he covers discovering his gift and the twists and turns he takes to avoid using his talents full-time. Eventually John gives in to this gift and learns to fine tune his talents so that he can provide comfort to many. The book includes some basic descriptions of psychic gifts that is helpful for beginners and also offers many stories of the tender reunions between the living and the so called ""dead"". Highly recommended book."
2,short sighted,"I bought this for my daughter a few years ago, but she wasn't ready for it until now (she's 8). I grew up with some really interesting kid's books about the parables and wanted my kids to know the stories. I hadn't read this book in-depth (should have) before starting to read it to her. Tonight she asked for the story about a young girl hanging out with her grandfather for the day. It started well, but by the end, it implied that alcoholics, people experiencing spiritual apathy and non-believers were non-virtueous. That's not a message I want to send my kids. Wish I'd kept my old books that just told the stories and didn't apply moral superiority in them. I tore up the book and put it in recycle so it would have more value there."
3,Sliding Dog,"So, I wish I had read the reviews on this item before I bought my Gaiam Premium Yoga Mat. My first down dog on this mat nearly ended in a face plant. As it comes out of the wrapper, it is slippery indeed. Note, I was using the mat with the ""big bump,"" logo side up and the small bumps toward the floor.After consulting with my teacher, I decided to give the mat one more chance but only after spraying both surfaces with Formula 409 and scrubbing thoroughly with a coarse Scotch Brite pad. That was enough to make the pad at least usable on a second try. Right now I plan to proceed with caution, but if I slip again this sucker is going back to the store.Using a yoga mat would seem to be a no brainer, but not so in this case. If Gaiam plans to continue selling this model they need to include some instructions about how to prepare and place the mat for safe use."
1,If you're looking for a slippery yoga mat...,"then this is for you. I can't stay in downward dog without my hands and feet slipping from under me. The mats at my gym don't do this. I'm going to have to buy one of those. This Gaiam mat is well-cushioned so if you want to just sit or lay down on it, then it probably is sufficient for you."
5,Vol. 1 Science and the Bible,"Volume 1, (in a series of three, progressively more advanced texts) for home-school high school or junior high research with mini-labs designed to intrigue the youthful scientist. The 30 simplistic demonstrations provide clear explanation of the Biblical link to science as the readers progress. This text explores the scriptural parallel with science as the proof of Biblical assertions. Great beginning foundation for youth to research their own queries."
1,Not effective,"I have a skin for my Blackberry and love it...but this one for the Motorola is just plain useless. It falls off, doesn't protect the corners where it gets damaged the most, is flimsy, etc. Just not a phone design that accommodates this type of skin...in my humble opinion."
2,Cheaply made-- what do I expect for $0.01,This rubbery thing actually caused my RAZR to sweat! Condensation forming under the skin. The top straps kept slipping off on the fold of the phone.Like I said-- what do I expect for a $0.01 + shipping? Got what I paid for. There ought to be a category for things that cost too little to be worth returning!
4,Pink Silicon Skin,"This item originally didn't fit the phone I had, a Verizon Razr, but after letting the suppliers know they sent me a replacement one that does fit. I appreciated their quick feedback and the quality of customer service. It was definitly a worthwhile purchase!"
2,yeah it is pink,I thought I could get away with buying a non pink phone and skinning it.Bad Bad Bad idea.
1,Absurd,"This has to be the most ridiculous book I have ever read. Especially when I read a review saying that the author had an excellent view on what makes teenage girls tick. I'd hate to see the girls Terry was based off of, they must be complete idiots.A quick read, yes, but not entertaining, believable or enjoyable in the slightest. If it were possible, I would give this book a zero. It's not worth a glance."
3,Just Okay,"This book wasn't that good. I started reading it in June, put it down, and then picked it up again in September and then put it down for the final time. I could not finish. It was putting me to sleep. Put on the bright side, I loved the character. She was very funny."
1,"This album is an odor, an incredibly bad one","This trash is surely going to be on my list of the worst hip hop albums of 2005. Public Enemy has always been a bad group and Chuck D knows absolutely nothing about politics. He's a stupid conspiracy theorist who thinks he's some kind of rebel. The only people who listen to this garbage are people who want their idiotic politics re-enforced. If your into ""concious"" rap, than get Kanye's new album(and I'll even admit that Kanye isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer but his album was way better than this trash). This is certainly one of the year's worst albums and anyone who doesn't need to have their idiotic beliefs re-enforced should not buy this garbage under any circumstances."
4,Biased review on destined cult-classic!,"My longtime friend Weetus Cren stars in this slasher spoof about the movie-making business so my review is most likely biased. However i have long been a fan of obscure film whether it be the heralded foreign film- anime- grindhouse- Corman styled b movie and the low budget independant project. This movie fits somewhere between a B-movie and an exploitation comedy horror. What saves this film is the tongue in cheek performances, great colors, and quirky camera angles and cinematography. Everyone looks like theyre enjoying themselves and many including Mr Weetus Cren give over the top expressions that make you laugh. All in all its a professional wellmade low budget film that is better than alot of films that try to do this type of film. Theres a few faces youve seen on tv or other films and at onetime Bruce Cambell was being approached to participate, but in the end its held by many firsttime actors and handled well!"
5,This is the REAL DEAL,"I am never, ever compelled to write reviews on here, but this record has changed all that. Young Mr. Schroeder has crafted a record of authentic, emotional songs--call it indie rock, call it americana--I call it great old fashioned songwriting. My favorite track would have to be 'The Real World' but thats a tough call to make. It features a beautiful chorus with female vocals adding a counterpoint to Schroeder's honeyed tenor. I work in the music recommendation business, and I'd recommend this record to fans of The Mountain Goats, Ryan Adams, and Death Cab for Cutie. Jump on this now so you can say you knew about it first. This boy's going places. BIG places."
4,mutant rock-o-sauraus,"This album sounds much like wolverine, from the x-men. If instead of adamantium claws, he had three guitars shoot out of each hand, and rocked like the wild beast that he is, with each one. This album is defiantly worth getting if you're a connoisseur of music and enjoy a good bluesy album every now and again. His harmonica playing just sounds nice on rainy days."
5,BRILLIANT. Do NOT miss this album!,"You will be hearing about Aaron Schroeder for a long time. Southern Heart in Western Skin shines and sparkles. From the first moment I heard Aaron's ""Movin' Movin' Train"", I was all aboard. The rest of the tracks on this album share the same kind of magic.On several of the songs, Aaron features one of the most creative and instrumentally tight backing bands out there (Mu Meson). They add interesting sonic details throughout the songs they contribute to. With their collaboration, Aaron's consistenly well-developed up-tempo pop-folk becomes nothing less than phenomenal. It's actually very difficult to imagine improving this album."
5,great,my favorite kind of pencil. they sharpen well and the ink is nice and dark. the lead does not break easily or dull quickly which is always a plus.
3,Good solid compilation for traditional approach,"A very nice textbook, with a broad selection of literature, thought-provoking questions on each selection, short author bios, discussions of literature-related concepts, and even some pictures of authors. By tackling fiction, poetry, and drama all, the book has a very comprehensive and broad approach. A specialist in any of these three areas might look elsewhere for a more focused approach to their field; for a far-ranging english literature, class, the book is very solid."
5,Better than the original??,"This, of course, is the Spanish language release of Rick's ""Looking for the Light"" album, which I also own. Dare I say it, I actually prefer this one. Not all the songs are the same, but of those that are, it is refreshing to hear them in a slightly different way. It shows just how strong an artist Rick Trevino is - the fact that you may not understand all the words (although I speak some Spanish) but can still enjoy the songs all the same. If ""Perdi la Partida"" (a.k.a. ""Full Deck of Cards"") doesn't get you tapping your feet, nothing will."
2,playback quality without the external mic. isn't good,"I received this product last week and used it without the external microphone. I heard more of the ""machine noise"" than the conversation (during playback). I had the settings set specifically for my use, and the noise it made on playback was annoying."
2,Sounds like he was inspired by a sports tv contract,"Quasi-""inspirational music"" inspired by bicycle racing? I can recognize the strains of this from the bad coverage of the REAL Tour de France by American TV networks. Unfortunately, it falls on the side of too light and tinkly to measure up to the strength and grit of the athletes this soundtrack seeks to enhance. It lacks resonance and depth. Sportif types looking for more inspiring music with more of an edge might look to the soundtrack from The Natural."
3,Good book for new readers,"This is a good book for those who do not know Mahabharat story. The reason it is good for the beginners is that it is concise and flows through the subject quickly. So it would be a good book for new readers who can quickly get a sort of overview of Mahabharat.If you already know Mahabharat plot and story, try and get a little advanced book."
2,disappointing,"i love r.k.narayan's narrative, but the way he retold the great epic is disappointing. he relies on the power of his narrative and forgets to stick to the epic style. the book captures most of the ideas, but it disregards the beautiful and magical details that embellish the epic, just like they embellish the culture it belongs to. the retold mahabharata may be a good read for those who want to have an idea of the epic, but then the idea can be obtained from the internet and for free."
4,Very entertaining,"I read this much faster than I thought I would. I understand it's a shortened segment of the Mahabharata, but there were parts I wish were a bit more detailed, especially when Arjuna separates from his brothers in exile."
5,Great book for newbie,"I'm taking a Religion class specified in Hinduism. I myself has never been exposed to the material before, and this book definitely makes it interesting, helpful and very easy to understand for newbies like me. Recommend for beginners."
1,Middle East Science Fiction,"If you only read one book about the conflict, this should emphatically not be it. Tanya Reinhart comes from the Noam Chomsky school of anti-Zionism (Chomsky was her PHD thesis supervisor)...that's all you need to know. The publisher describes this book as a middle east primer, but it is anything but that. In fact, this little book, while providing interesting insight into the twisted mindset of an Israeli leftist who is happy to defame and demonize her own country, its leaders and its institutions (as well as just about every other actor in the conflict, including the US and Arafat!), is in fact a highly creative (read extremely one-sided, fabricated and paranoid) work of propaganda. An entertaining work of science fiction, but not the place to go for a balanced understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
1,Majorly biased,"The book is majorly and unprofessionaly biased towards the Palestinian view. There seems to be little if no consideration of WHY Israel acts the way it does. As such, it portrays Israel as an aggresive predator state and somewhat questions its right to exist. Clearly, the author has no understanding whatsoever of Middle Eastern political history, and her ignorance is sadly reflected in this account."
1,Misleading and counterproductive,"The history presented here is basically bogus. That is the main problem with the book. Oh, sure, there is no consideration for human rights, not for Arab rights nor Jewish rights. But the big problem is a lack of honesty, after which any recommendations that are made become suspect.What is the best way to end the war of 1948, in which five Arab nations tried to get rid of Israel, a nation that formed because it was the only way to defend Jewish rights of life, liberty, and property in the region? In my opinion, I think some way needs to be found to get Israel's neighbors to grant the Jews of Israel these basic rights! But you'll never see this issue in Reinhart's book."
1,My old RCA VCR is worth repairing,"I agree with the reviewer from Los Gatos, CA. I bought this model for the simple set-up and for compatabilty with my RCA TV, but returned it due to poor playback quality on SLP tapings. Thinking it was defective, I replaced it with the same model, but found similar results. If I can return it a second time, I'm getting a Sony or JVC."
2,Well....,"This is a good enough VCR, which I bought to replace a Sony in the same price range. The machine just arrived and I'm both happy and disappointed. Happy because the machine was a breeze to set up, works fine, and is blessedly silent in operation. On the other hand, recording quality is not very good and the construction is cheesy. There is no counter on the unit itself, which is an annoyance (especially since you can't hear the unit playing, rewinding, anything). I'm happy enough to keep it and it plays prerecorded tapes beautifully... but I liked my Sony better."
3,"It's easy to use, dubs and plays commercial tapes well ...","I have this VCR for about two years. The commercial advance stopped working properly and I am starting to get error messages and the tape pops out for no reason. However, I record on a daily basis then watch the shows at night so the machine gets a lot of wear and tear and could probably use a good cleaning. My only real problem with the machine is it doesn't pull in the channels as well as it should. For that reason I only record shows I plan to watch and tape over. I use my SONY to tape any shows I wish to save and have a noce copy of. However, to dub tape to tape or watch commercial tapes, it is a great machine. It is very easy to use and I like that I never have to reset the clock, not even for daylight savings time. But I bought it to tape from the TV, and it is a very poor machine for that. It could use more insulation or whatever is needed to block out interference."
4,Very good unit,"I bought this unit about three weeks ago and it seems to work great. The only reason I gave it a four star is because I have not recorded on it yet, so I don't know how well it records, other then that I'm very happy with it."
3,Old and Outdated view of Thailand's rural sector.,"On the one hand, it is a good view of the past lifestyle of the people outside the metropolis Bangkok. On the other hand, it is also an outdated tourism video. The singers, etc. presented on this video are from a time gone past. If you are a history student who have visited Thailand before and want to get a view of the past, this may be a good buy. On the other hand, if you've never been to Thailand and think this video will show you what it is like - NOT! Thailand has changed so much in the past decade. This video was actually shot in 1983 but redistributed in 1994. Get Thailand - The Golden Kingdom instead."
3,"Dark and evocative, an interesting contrast.","A different side to a familiar author, this book is much darker than the usual De Lint novel. True to its author, however, it captures you with the same pull that so many of his books do. It is very evident that this is a book that De Lint felt he needed to write, ""to get it out of his system"" so to speak, and the finish is rather abrupt. Even so, it shows his versatility as an author, describing with vivid detail the more gruesome aspects that his other novels only allude to. I still would recommend it to De Lint fans, but perhaps not quite as appropriate for younger readers. Don't read it when alone or before going to sleep, though!"
2,What's all the fuss about?,"After reading all other reviews, I was eager to read this one. Now I'm left to ask myself what all the hype was about. I found the characters to be very wooden and the dialogue completely unbelievable. Everyone was either really really good or really really evil with no texture or subtlety. Still, DeLint used some good devices. He then proceeded to run them into the ground and use slight variations on the same scene over and over."
5,and now for something completely different...,"Highly recommended. Fresh de Lint in a new vein. The author says in the introduction that he felt compelled to write the book, and it shows. Different, powerful stuff."
4,A talented Latin duo,"""Mar Adentro"" is a solid Latin CD from the duo Donato y Estefano. My current favorite song on the CD is the opening track, ""Sin Ti,"" an exciting, playful composition with a full, rich sound. ""Agua de Cascada,"" with its fun, bouncy sound, is also enjoyable. Those songs are nicely complemented by the mellow, romantic ""Estoy Enamorado."" The vocal performances on each song are outstanding.""Mar Adentro"" is not, in my opinion, as good as D & E's CD ""Entre la Linea del Bien y la Linea del Mal,"" a truly mind-blowing CD which expands the horizons of Latin pop music. But ""Mar Adentro"" is still a solid achievement, and well worth the attention of fans of Latin pop."
3,Hey not bad,Weird this might be a little off but this is my first time without making this a report so here we go. Well I guess this wasn't too bad. One of the songs was exelent. Sin Ti. This song moved me in every way possible. If this song was a single I would give this a five star rating. Yet with all of the other songs it drops down more and more.
4,for my lawnmower,"So far so good. A bit more expensive than other brands but it's supposed to be better. I dont' know if it's better, but it's worked for me. Would recommend."
5,Works great,"This is a really nice outdoor extension cord. Heavy duty. Good quality. Flexible. I liked the lighted outlet that shows you have power. I used the cord with my electric tiller. I did not have any issues. The bright yellow color stands out in the grass, so there is less of a chance of running it over. Highly recommended."
3,OK power cord. Thick and hard to coil.,I donno if it is the gauge or the wrapping but this power cable does not coil very well. I use it for mowing the lawn but would prefer one that lies down flat on the grass. Definitely heavy duty.
5,Great for DJ Gear,"This cable has a great outer protection and slides across concrete without scratching. The plugs are great and lit, so I can find them in the dark. It is also a thick enough gauge to handel all of my DJ equipment (pioneer ddj-s1), speakers (2 300w PA speakers and an 800w sub), and laptop. Be careful about buying cheaper cords for high wattage usages, as it could catch fire or even break your equipment. Recommend this one, its worth the money and will last a long time."
1,LOST RECEIPT,"Very dissapointed on quality chrome was chipping of welds ""DID NOT COME WITH OIL DRAIN PLUG"" had minor rust inside was going to return but lost receipt & did not want to go thruw all the hassel thank god i sold it to friend!!! hope to get ""some kind of apology at least """
3,postage rifoff!,I bought a stocking cap and the postage was almost as high as the price of the cap. Total ripoff and would not buy from them again. Buyer beware!
5,heard it on NPR and had to have it,Very beautiful and moving music. Wish I would have heard of it long ago!I find several of the pieces stuck in my head for days after listening. Great way to lift my spirits during my daily commute.
3,Mixed feelings,"I feel very mixed about this book. On the one hand the author's smug writing style and arrogant assumption of superiority grate (TJ Cloutier is a world champion and he doesn't write this arrogantly!). On the other hand, the book does offer some good advice on poker psychology and the attitudes one needs to win. It can also be quite amusing in places when Daniel tells some of his own poker annecdotes. I guess I'd say, if you have a tiny poker library and are looking to expand, this is probably not the book to go to; but if you already have most of the basic books, this could be a useful place to expand your perspectives."
4,Way of success,Suceeding in sport is not made by hazard.... it needs specific aptitudes that Mr WEINBERG et Mr GOULD explained very well in their booK. Please to the readers:can you give me the e mail ftom Mr Weinberg and Me Gould. I want to join them. Thank you. MICHEL REQUET
3,OK,It is what you would expect...just a bit pricey for 25 shots...would probably sell MORE if just a bit lower $4 or $5 / 25 shots ??Would LIKE non-lead shot ALSO..Delivery from BIG EDGE SPORTS was prompt.
3,perfect,pefect for huntingbe good for rabbits hope u all enjoy it be close when u take the shot about 10 yrds ut very pricey
5,A must-read for home cooking enthusiasts,"Definitely a MUST-READ if you are a home cooking enthusiast and want to go beyond blindly following the recipe steps but get an in-depth understanding of what's going on in your oven.Had a slew of my culinary questions, like ""why thawed meat is more dry when cooked than the fresh one"", answered.Most of information presented in this book can be found on the web these days but you know, having it all compiled in one place saves you a lot of browsing time.Worth every buck spent on it."
2,"Can you say ""Egomaniac""----?????","I bought this book because I read a glowing review of it in our weekly rag. This same weekly often extols the virtues of local bands that I've never heard of and usually never hear of again. It would seem that the reviewer of this book had as much on-track knowledge of good literature as the music reviewers in his shared rag have of what makes a good band. This book is a painful example of an author who apparently was a monument unto himself. The stories in it are boring and, in many cases, written with a pompous air. The ones that aren't, are mostly depressing. I doubt that I will give this author a second chance."
3,this is crap,"i bought this in june of '99. in september it broke. i had bought a replacement plan, so i got a new one. it then broke again, and yet again (3 times! ) i finally got a sony and it works great."
3,Average Player,"The RCA cd player is a great buy for it's price although it does not offer very many options when it comes to playback of a CD. It does not come with good accssories, but the sound quality is SUPERIOR to any CD player that I have ever listened too! The bass in the supplied headphones is awesome and didn't hiss when I increased the volume. I liked it for a while, but I took it back and got the Sony D-EJ715 CD Walkman whcih I LOVE!!! The Sony CD player offers all the features of the RCA player but includes a wired remote, a sleek-smaller design, a longer battery life, street-style headphones, rechargeable batteries, a carrying case, and a built-in charging capability which the RCA player doesn't offer. So if you have the extra money go for any of the new line of Sony CD players which offer ""G-Protection"". My Sony model which is D-EJ715 cost on average $129.99 but is worth every cent."
2,i can see why its discontinued,this unit i purchased new. it was made three yrs ago. the lid has to be slammed shut sometimes several times for the player to work. maybe when the weather warms up it will work better.the buttons also have to pushed many times.
1,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book. I assumed that Martha had grown along with the trends, so I was sorry to see that the colors in the book are the same ones that have been in her magazine for, like, a decade. There isn't very much useful information in this, and I kind of resent the fact that she is dictating a very limited (and limitING) number of color palettes from which I am supposed to choose. Choice is everywhere in the design world, and the trend is NO trend, so Martha's approach seems very old-fashioned and dictatorial. Even that wouldn't be quite so bad if she were using more current colors than her old stand-bys."
3,More of the same,"If you're into decorating, then yes, this is a book to have, along with some of the other ""home keeping"" books. However, many of the ideas have been in other books as well. MSLO recycles a lot of ideas, so if you have, say, ""Good Things,"" or ""Decorating Details,"" you'll see one or two things again. However, there are many projects and ideas that have not been republished, so it's good to have more ideas in your collection. I wasn't AS impressed as I was with the other two or three on the subject."
2,hnnnnngh... just subscribe to her magazines.,"please, if you regularly buy martha stewart living magazines, DON'T bother buying this book. unless of course you want to see more of the same, but packaged altogether with nice binding and a deceptively original cover. it's not even actually ""more"" of the same, but actually ""the same"" -- this is a compilation of reproductions, old stuff that was published over the years. not too fresh, and particularly aggravating to someone who's a subscriber."
1,How old is this book anyway?,"How can a new book look this old? It's the same old sagey, seafoamy greens and pale yellows that Martha has pushed for, like, 20 years now. I like Martha, but I was assuming that her new book would be about new colors that are more on trend than this. I'm disappointed."
1,Avoid this player,"It seemed like a really good buy - under $200 for a 20GB A/V player,however, don't let the disk drive capacity and the recording features fool you....unless you don't intend to listen to MP3s on it. The biggest annoyance, one that puts you off using it, is a migraine causing loud click at the start of each track. It is there no matter what volume you set the unit to. Secondly, it takes forever (a minute or two) to start playing a track from the menu. Third...don't leave home without a pin to reset the unit every now and then. It just would not turn on."
3,Decent,"This jukebox isn't too bad. It works as a harddrive, in fact, the storage on this device is actually a labtop hard drive. It uses music match, which isn't too bad. You can also just drag music/video/pictures onto the system. The screen is pretty nice. Pictures and video come out pretty clear, although it only plays mpeg video files.It records from the tv also. This is a really neat feature.What i hate about this item is the battery. I would say it lasts about 90 minutes of continuous play for music. For video, its much less. However, if you turn it on or off, it cuts down the battery time by about half. I wouldn't reccommend this simply for its battery life. Its horrible.The menu is also slow, and can be hard to navigate. You cannot navigate through the menu while listening to music, which is highly annoying.When recording video, the audio and video is not always synchronized. RCA def. needs to fix this.Overall, i would not reccommend this device, not until RCA releases new firmware."
1,"Good Idea, poorly made product","The toggle switches are poorly made, first they were very difficult to use and now they have both broken off!!! This product is not worth the money!!!"
1,I paid $400 to be a beta tester.....,"The software is flat out awful in this device. The GUI is clumsy and unstable. If you want to change songs you have to stop the music, go all the way back to the main menu->audio->artist...oops, hit a button that says ""This feature is not available""..wait 5 seconds for that to go away...I have not been able to have this thing play 3 songs in a row without locking up either. If you thought like me that you can spend the same price as an ipod plus get video, jpg and CF, trust me it doesn't succeed at any of them...get the ipod. Or get the Archos...it plays divx movies."
2,"Great Idea. Poor Result. A ""Video MP3"" Player that Wouldn't","Imagine buying a MP3 player that will not allow you to record/playback copyrighted material. Well that is exactly what RCA has released- a ""video MP3"" player that will not allow you to record any copyrighted material. I thought it would be great to record some of my DVD's to this device so that I could watch them on the road just like I listen to my CD's on the road with an MP3 player but witout that capability the Lyra is useless to me and I imagine most other people. I did however record some shows off of the TV as a test and the results were very acceptable although the picture would freeze on occasion. Also the user interface is very clunky. I am sure other manufacturers will improve on this idea in the near future."
5,RCA has a winner with this,"I bought this unit with some concern as the reviews were a little mixed. After a month I can say that it is one of the best gadgets I have ever owned, including the iPod. Used on its own, it makes PERFECT videos off a cable box or VCR. I used it on a recent trip to London with 25 kid's videos recorded. Whether used on its own (as on a plane) or plugged in to a TV, the replay was excellent with good sound. Reviews said there was macroblocking and other artifacts -- perhaps with the old software, I have seen almost none.MP3 playback is on a par with the iPod but with greater loudness available. In sum, in one little device I can hold my entire family photo album, a few thousand songs and over a dozen movies. It is worth more than what I paid for it. Highly, highly recommended."
4,"Dead air in ""Shuffle all"" mode","Just purchased this product. Tryed to get a solution to my problem from the RCA ""service"" dept. They acted like they didn't know what I was talking about and told me to send it back to them!In a nutshell- Quite often in the ""shuffle all"" mode there is a pause of up to a minute between songs! I would like the next song to start instantly after the prior song ends. Can this be fixed?"
3,"Great product, needs a Better Software Engineer Behind It","Cool concept. Put video and audio on the same device? Brilliant! Great display, easy tools, horrible software and instructions. They are working to improve the software slowly but surely, so be patient. The ability to record off of the TV or DVD is very impressive. Very easy.Overall, I think I'll keep it and hope that RCA can figure out the software issues. Huge wow factor!"
1,defective toggle switches,"The first thing that happened to me, was the toggle button for pausing, fast forwarding, etc. broke off the first time I used it. I am returning it for the newer versionX3000 that has one big toggle button and I hope it is not defective. I like the Lyra for what it has to offer and that is why I am trying the newer version. Hopefully, I will not be back here with another bad review."
4,Better than iPOD & Archos - buy this!!,"Got this for my son for his teenage birthday. He wanted an ipod, but they're just so antiquated already. He loves this machine, and all the buds are clamoring over it because he can play movies, funny TV clips, all his favorite music, and show photos. It also can play stored movies and music onto a friend's TV or stereo, or do a slideshow from our camera's CF card. Also comes with a tape adapter to play your music on your car's tape player. The size is still pocket-sized and not too heavy (around 12oz.). The video screen is excellent and shows up much better than the Archos models. Comes with nice earbuds and has great sound quality. A HUGE plus is that it comes with all the accessories you need: case, USB cable, two audio/video in/out cables, self-contained battery, tape player adapter, etc. Has 20Gb memory, and if you go to the yahoogroups user site, you'll see that alot of techhies have upgraded their Lyras to 80Gb without much difficulty."
2,Bad Hardware. Bad Software,"I have already exchanged my Lyra for a replacement because the first one locked up. The second one has taken 2 fatal hardware crashes. Functionality wise the rocker buttons are the worst. I never know what event if any will be processed and it takes forever for the event to be processed. The next issue is the shuffle all functionality is poor. With over 2000 files I should never hear the same song very often. However, the first song played each session is always the same and the same song repeat between sessions. I have heard the same song 3 and 4 times a week. My guess is this file number is used as the seed to the random file number generator, therefore the probability of generating the same file number increases dramatically. I should also be able to shuffle all songs for a specific Genre."
1,Media Player Review,Worst piece of crab I've ever purchased. Terrible navigation and very poor workmanship. Lasted about a year before breaking. Buttons came off even though I took care of it. Horrible menu system and no multi-task capabilities. Worst engineering I've seen. I'll pay extra for an iPOD and be much happier.
4,Nice product,"Got it a few days back and overall its a nice product.Pros:1) Audio, video, jpgs all in one2) Nice set of accessories - car kit, cables, etc.3) Sounds good. RCA software works well.Cons:1) Buttons can be confusing at times2) I dont care for musicmatch jukebox but the RCA softwareworks well.3) Case is functional but makes the buttons difficult t0maneuver (sp?).As for one of the earlier reviews, you may want to try plugging the car adapter into the line out port opposed to the head phone jack - I am guessing RCA figured most people would use the volume control on their car stereo...Over all I like it and its a keeper. I dislike musicmatch because it tends to place all of the songs at the top level directory on the device while the RCA synch feature mirrors the pc hard drive - which is organized they way I like it."
1,How can ANYONE review this product yet?,It HASN'T been released yet - what are these people talking about? They probably have not even touched one of these yet. RCA doesn't even acknowledge this product on their web site yet?
2,"Little promise, more disappoinment","Waited six months to get a device with more promises than hardware. I bought it mainly for the photo function and the video playing ability. Video can be played but only in Mpeg-4, not mpeg-1/2 as promised. Quality of video is okay, but that is not the point. All 3.5"" screen could give you a reasonable viewing experience.Accessories are rediculous. The designer of the case should, let's say, lose his job. The ear plug on the car kit does not even fit the device (it is for phones rather than headphones).Basically, RCA rushed this device out without even thinking that it will ruin its reputation, if it had one."
1,Very dissapointed...,"First of all, the battery life was supposed to be 8 hours. After then initial charge, I was lucky if I got a complete movie out of it.Initially, support was responsive to my problem, but I ended up waiting an additional 30 days for my replacement unit as they were on back order.Upon receiving my replacement unit, I found the battery life to be comparably short (to the first)- this after several hours re-creating my folders and play-lists.So I learned to live with the brief battery life, but two weeks later, the unit dies completely.I'm sure my experience is not indicative of the typical quality for this unit, but it's been quite dissapointing nonetheless. I have heard the battery problem is not unique to my unit, so don't expect 8 hours. I do hope your unit last more than two weeks, though."
4,Great buy but lacking in some areas,"I just picked this baby up and after about 5-6 hours of playing around with it i found that this is a awesome little machine, Copying audio/video is a breeze and audio/video playback is excellent(Note the 2780 handles dark areas pretty bad) The only gripe i have about the 2780 is the lack of features right now, alot of basic features that should be included IE: Playlists,Password Protection & Name Tags instead you get a ""Will be included in a futeure upgrade meesage"", Small price to pay for a new product on the market,Dont let these minor problems effect your decision on buying this gem"
2,The One I Had To Let Go...,"The Lyra was my first PVP machine and I picked one up in January 2004 not long after its release. I was enamored with its sleek screen with dazzling video, cool interface, respectable audio fidelity, and other amenities - including the ability to record directly from a video source. I auditioned one for a month before after much hand wringing, forced to return to Best Buy just before my 30 day return was about to expire. There were a number of factors which led me to do so; glitches with the interface, video issues, system freezes, etc. Finally, I experienced a complete lock-up of the interface that not even the pin reset could undo. Mind you, my Lyra wasn't abused in the least - never dropped, rocked, or jolted. I *really* liked the Lyra even in spite of its considerable flaws but had no choice but to return it. I've moved on since then to a much more issue free Creative Zen Vision M and have no regrets...but you know what they say about your ""first love"". Sigh."
1,Another product built to break,"CONS: Can't really use while walking/running(too big). Headphone jack stopped working. Most of the time it had 5 minute waiting period (frozen) for loading songs. You cannot scroll music while listening, hence going back to the menu and having to wait the five minutes again. The knobs came off so i had to select songs only by growing my fingernail long enough to reach the selector. If you still are adamant about buying this, MAKE SURE you carry around a paperclip to reset this device for its inevitable freezes. The best part is...it stopped accepting the charge from the power source. What a piece of garbage!PROS: 20 gigs/plays/records (some) video / looks nice and feels good when it is shattered with a hammer"
3,not in good shape,"was good at the beginning but now it all falling apart, the audio output is not even working now and I have to result to getting my audio from the line out."
2,It's ok........ I guess,"Purchased early january. Love the video features. Did like the photo features. Mp3 features lack a few things. The video recorder/playback is cool, works fine for me. Being able to connect to the tv is great. The photos were cool until it lost the ability to read jpeg(i still see the photo but it doesnt fit the screen). I get an annoying, file format not supported. Mp3s play ok but you dont get the ability to search for another song while listening to the current selection. Adding costume album art creates, file format not supported, and no play. Desperately needs a current playlist to add songs on the fly. It takes eight seconds to load a song once selected. A lot of features still unavailable. Overall I feel I didnt get my moneys worth considering that two months later and im already troubleshooting problems. I have all current firmware/application updates. I use it with a brand new dell."
1,Good idea but that's all,"This player looks great and the specifications sound nice. However, the firmware is really bad and RCA did not provide a working update. There are problems with so many files, that are not supported. Many DivX don't work at all, some work with bad synchronization errrors. Even some MPegs, a much more standardized format, don't work at all. With some MPegs, I just see Fatal Errors. All the files I tried, and it was a lot, worked pretty well on a PC, a DVD-Player, and even on an iPod. If you want to watch videos, look for sth else, that'll save you some stress."
1,I'm Returning This,"After reading reviews and seeing that most others are having the same problems I am with the RCA jukebox, I'm going to return mine after all. I'd rather not have one at all than be a $400 tester for RCA on this prematurely released product.As others, I am going to go with the Archos. I cannot afford it now, but at $300 more, and 60 GB more, including more features, and it's not a 1st generation, it'll be worthwhile to save and get a superior unit.Update: I returned the RCA jukebox and bought the Archos 20 GB. It was only $100 more and is worth every penny. I won't elaborate here because this is for RCA Lycra reviews. However, I must say that Archos provides software for you to transfer video to the proper codec. Please don't waste your money on the RCA JOKEbox."
3,SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT FOR DUMMIES,"I think that should be the title of the book.Ram & Sabine Reddy have written a practical handbook useful for all Managers, cutting across their specializations & levels. It offers a birds eye view without skipping the details. A book all Managers can use for practical & effective management of costs across the supply chain.Ram's real life experience & Sabine's objective research & analysis make an ideal combination of theory & practice.This book could be recommended as study material for IT/ Management students"
4,GE 35365 Voice-Activated Handheld Mini Cassette Recorder,"Great choice if you want the quailty of a full size audio cassette, but want to be able to tuck it into a music bag or backpack. My daughter uses this recorder to tape voice exercises as well as lectures. Great quality for the price. Cannot go wrong with this one!"
4,Perfect hand held recorder,"This recorder is the ideal companion for us in the paperless society. It fits perfectly inyour hand and once you become attached to it you'll be operating it without have to look to see what button to press for a particular function. Great price, too!"
1,[bad] sound ...,"I'm a student journalist who tends to rely on tape recorders for interviews, preferring them for accuracy's sake. I bought this one about a year ago, and it's given me nothing but trouble ever since. Playback is atrocious, especially in really quiet settings, where all it seems to pick up is the horrible white noise of nothingness ..."
5,:),"i thought this was a great product for the price. i used it for 5 nights, no leackage, no repumping was needed. i found the same product some where else for twice the price. so everall im very pleased."
3,Good for the price!,The valve for adding air is very good and easy to use (it is a check valve).It is a little taller than others I have had which was good.So far so good!!
4,Great for the price,"The only bad thing I can say is that its hard to get full of air, and it seemed to have lost a bit after one weekend. Otherwise for the money its great. I also have two little ones and my toddler enjoyed trying to jump on it numerously and it held up well. Also fits well in the tent with a queen air mattress too. Would reccommend."
4,The Knowland Retribution,"The reason I loved this book, the plot, the characters, and the writing is that there havebeen many times in my own life that I have felt victimized by big companies andpoliticians enriching themselves at my expense. And each of those times, I had no powerto do anything but grin and bear it. In this story, someone takes power into his own hands.The result is like a cross between a suspense thriller and a classy novel. For me, it was aa wonderful vicarious trip, like being in the front car of a roller coaster without having toactually be there.Joana Cannon"
5,Justice has a whole new meaning,"I loved The Knowland Retribution because it's a great read that also makes you question the foundation of our society. Richard Greener's writing is a cross between John Grisham and Robert Ludlum. He creates great characters to which we can connect in both sympathy and dispise. It also questions our justice system, our capitalist society, and our base ethics between right and wrong. Could you turn the other cheek if a big company knowingly released a product that killed all your family because it was a ""statistically reasonable risk""??? You find yourself flipping and flopping on your moral fiber as to the whose right and whose wrong. Highly recommended and can't wait to read Greeners next book."
3,dont waste huge amount of money,"this reminds me of Stuart Woods 'Stone Barrington' series (yes, I know, got very boring) and the amount of money for one of these is outrageous. I thought it was an error but no, they want over 40.00 for one book. So, I got a copy from a friend who was baffled why I wanted to read it.It came no where close to the raves by persons reviews written (mostly about 6 years ago) and cant equate anything these books are about with anything written by John Grisham.I did find out he is a heart transplant survivor and I wont make the obvious crude comment here. There have been no more in the 'series' of two.If it had been the 7.99, i wouldna put this here review up, but, wow, way overpriced"
3,They are okay. They didn't last long.,Basically how it reads above. The product was fantastic for the first two months. Sincerely impressed. Then it got a little colder recently and it's streaks galore on my windshield. Overall they are okay for the price. You get what you pay for as they say. I think next time I'll spend the extra dollars for a hopefully longer lasting wiper.
4,Great gift for Mother's day!,"Great book, but be prepared for a lot of religious themes! I purchased two for both sets of Grandmas. They LOVED it! I can't wait to get them back to give to my daughter when she's older."
4,The perfect gift,The journal was purchased as a gift and it was VERY well-received! The new Grandma didn't even know such a journal existed. She is thrilled with it!
3,The Story of the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem,"This is a good video but leaves some intriguing items out or unexplored - such as the full reunion concert - the alleged IRA ties that Patrick and Thomas Clancy had in the 1940's up to the time they immigrated to the USA in 1951. In addition the sources of their songs, especially the ones in Irish (gaelge) should have been examined. However sparse the material is, the Clancys and Tommy Makem are always engaging and for die hard fans, it is worth it to purchase."
4,"A nice, entertaining video for preschoolers & kindergartners","My daughter, Kelly, who is 3 1/2, fell in love with this video from the rental store. We rented it twice and she was so upset about returning it the second time that we decided to purchase it. It is a nice, sweet, magical story about Christmas. It is the perfect length, about 30 minutes or so, and sends a good message about faith and hope."
4,Not so popular but very competent,"I bought these piano quintets from the initial positive review of them by Enriquez. I would say that I am and still am pleasantly surprised at these enjoyable gems composed by Thuille. Thuille has a Brahmsian spirit in reference to these works and it manifests itself in his total competence of the form. He carefully crafts his themes and developments. There are no superfluous notes. Each movement logically follows its predecessor. What is shocking is that these works are not standing alongside the Piano Quintets of Brahms, Dvorak, Schubert and Schumann, because they are worthy."
1,Thuille? Better Dohnanyi or Dvorak.,"People who enjoy listening to the Thuille piano quintets have probably never had to learn and rehearse them. This music is ""cute"" to listen to once or twice, but extremely trite and boring to learn. I've been a performing pianist for 50 years, and I can't bear to play these pieces. They are just difficult enough that they do require some practicing, and not interesting enough to make the practice and rehearsals enjoyable. All of the chamber music groups that I've performed with have the same opinion. Sorry. Go for Dohnanyi or Dvorak if what you want is big, romantic, and interesting chamber music that includes piano."
3,Uhhh... It was kinda worth the money,"I bought this DVD player a few years ago. It usually works, but can be finicky about whether it will work or not. Occasionally, it gave a NODISK error, but I think this was due to heating or the player not being level, because I moved it, and it seems to work all the time now.The menu is a bit cludgy compared to ""modern"" DVD players, and switching to using captions still bewilders me from time to time.Overall, when it works, its a nice DVD player, ... (better than videotape, at least). It works with DVDR, which is pleasing!"
1,The Poor Reviews are True,"As mentioned in previous reviews the system does crash in a consistent manner. Mine took a year to fail, but it freezes after several minutes of play and the chapter selection fails completely. Also, Thompson Electronics, the service support for RCA, is expensive and provides very poor service. Their solution to fixing my problem is to send a refurished system without even looking at my system. They cannot send a new system, since RCA stopped producing this product. I think that should indicate something."
1,You get what you pay for.,"I used this DVD player for approximately four months before it began experiencing occasional glitches (the Bug's Life DVD was one of those affected). Its performance was unpredictable in that some DVDs it would play flawlessly and others it would simply not play. Most irritating of all was that it was developing a nasty habit of partly playing movies and then shutting down just as the conclusion was drawing close. Needless to say, it's in the shop for the second time (the first time it came back with a clean bill of health, yeah right). The warranty is only three months parts and labor, so any work is coming out of pocket. Also, I found the remote for this unit clumsy and innefficient. My advice, spend more, you'll get more."
4,No problems here,"Given that I've received nothing but top-notch performance from this product, it's distressing to see so many negative reviews from others. I've fed it the most sophisticated discs I can find (including ""A Bug's Life: Collector's Edition"") and have had no problems. I suspect poor quality control on RCA's part. Based solely on my own experience, however, I give it five stars for video and audio quality and overall performance, and dock it one star for the lack of the generally common zoom feature and front panel chapter display (laserdisc owners can identify with the latter). Overall, an excellent player and an excellent buy."
1,FAR from good,"We bought this unit when it first came out. It was good in the beginning and then it just ate it. It would freeze up and pixelate(is that how you spell it? If the player was any good, I wouldn't have to worry about spelling words like this). Some movies worked well and others didn't get through the opening menu. I bought a lens cleaner and a scratch repair kit...it didn't help..this was the beginning of my denial stage. Then I admitted to the fact that it was the dvd player. I'm looking for some closure here! But reading all these reviews isn't helping any. Oh wells, I guess I'll just add buying a dvd player every year to my fixed expenses..just like car insurance."
4,Top value for the $$$,"Of all the entry level machines, I liked this one the best. Although I don't have a Home theater type system, I like the fact that this unit has Digital Dolby/DTS compatibilty so, I can hook it to one in the future. One problem I had when too many remote buttons were pushed, was the system locking up, and scrambled sound coming out. When this happens you have to pull the plug on it to fix it. If you can find it on sale like I did, it's an even better value."
3,Not a recommended DVD player,"I owned the DVD player for almost one year and have had multiple DVD's not perform. Disney's ""The Kid"" will shut down the DVD player after the FBI screen. Disney's ""Dinosaur"" will skip chunks of movie, an 1 hour and 23 minute movie ended up being only 45 mins, because of all the skipping. I called RCA and they also stated consumers had problems with ""Scary Movie"" and others. RCA blames that DVD manufactures are not following guidelines but all movies mentioned play fine on my JVC DVD player. It took a year to find problems on the RCA DVD player, these films were new releases and if the trend follows, soon it could be more DVD's that won't play. My suggestion is don't buy it."
1,WORKED FOR ONE DAY!,"I bought this DVD player 6 months ago for my Mom's Birthday, which was a few days ago. I always buy early and wanted to take advantage of all the deals around Christmas. The first time we plug it in we get the menu and the DVD starts. Then nothing. I have 40 DVD's and every single one doesn't work. I get a no disc error. Tried returing it to RCA and they say no! I have to pay some huge labor fee. I am past amazon's return policy, so basically i spent all this money and havn't even gotten one single use out of it! This is the second DVD player we have owned and it ...(stinks)! we bought one for ...(less money) at target that has lasted over a year and works perfectly! Do NOT BUY RCA!"
1,Don't waste your money,"I hope I save somebody the time and trouble of buying this piece of garbage. As some of the other reviewers have experienced, mine starting acting up after three months. I was told by the manufacturer that for $80 I should send it back for a ""reconditioned"" one. Went to Mail Boxes Etc... and sent it back. I received the ""new"" one about three weeks later and I am having the same problem with this one. The kicker of this whole mess was the woman at Mail Boxes Etc... told me that sometimes the same people send the machine back three to four times! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!"
4,Great Player!,"I don't know what the other people are talking about! I've got the Matrix as well as have rented A Bug's Life and they both played without a hitch! They were very smooth, great sound, crisp picture, and every option on each movie works flawlessly. I saw someone say that this system doesn't play VCD's, but I've had it play a couple with no problem. The only drawback to this system is it won't play CD-R's, but that's ok, since I only own one and am not too big on them."
4,Excellent player for the price,"I've had my RCA DVD player for about 1 year now and have had no trouble at all. I have noticed that it seems to get hot after a long while of use with the glass door shut, but that could just be all the other components in the stack. I keep the door open now and it stays cool. When I was looking for a player, I was informed that RCA players had trouble reading dual and quad layered discs(like Matrix), but it has had no trouble.(maybe he just wanted to sell me one for a higher price? ) I bought RCA partly because my TV and VCR were both RCA. It is a great DVD player for the money. All the other brands are very pricey and don't offer that many more features. By the way, mine will not play CD-R music discs...Just in case you were wondering."
1,You have to unplug it between viewings!,"Am on my third one of this model...each one with the same problem. After a few viewings, it began to get choosy about which DVDs it would read. Sometimes it would not even acknowledge that a DVD had been inserted! I finally figured out how to fix it, since RCA could not. When it does this, you have to unplug the machine from the outlet for about a half hour. Apparently this resets something and allows it to read again. Now, until I can replace it with a better machine, I unplug it each time I turn it off. So far, this works. It's a shame...I have always liked RCA until this machine. It performs GREAT when it works, but I will think twice before I buy an RCA product again."
3,"DVD play good, audio CD big problem","For DVD's this unit works fine. Great pic, great sound, etc. nocomplaints. The major problem is audio CD's. It will play if you putthe CD in and let it play. If you have to switch tracks, I would recommend you do so very slowly b/c it will tend to freeze. I don't know. Maybe it's only my unit...I would spend a little more and get a nicer one. Also mine does not play video cd (VCD)."
1,Player did not perform very well,"I purchased this player because it was the only one I could find that had an RF adaptor to hook up to my old TV. I have purchased some RCA products in the past and had no problems. That was not the case with this DVD player. After having hooked up the player it ran about 10 minutes and lost picture and also had distorted sound. I left it sit for about a half hour and tried it again with the same results, no picture and distorted sound. Some people have had good luck with this player but I DID NOT. It was returned the next day for a Magnavox. I have only had the Magnavox for about one week but so far no problems."
3,Worrisome machine.,"Not having either a DVD or CD player (I just feed discs to my iMac), I found the discounted price on this model to be all the rationale I needed to invest in such a device. It's capable of producing flawless images and sounds--unless it chooses not to acknowledge the presence of a disc in its drive, which happens far too often with my temperamental (fastidious?) machine. I would also advise prospective purchasers to check dimensions, as this model requires extra deep shelves. Finally, its remote switch is more likely to be compatible with GE or other RCA monitors than with Philips, Magnavox, or Sylvania monitors. (It may be important to remember that a VCR plus DVD assembly requires running the latter in ""auxilliary mode,"" which is hidden away somewhere in my set's menu choices and virtually inaccessible.) In short, the machine has done little to alter my high regard for similar products produced by Sony, Panasonic, and other Japanese manufacturers."
1,I'll Never Buy An RCA Product Again...,"I bought an RCA DVD player a year ago. 25 days after the warranty expired, my player DIED. No matter what I did ""No Disc"" was displayed. I shipped the thing back to the manufacturer, had to pay $80 and got a ""new"" one. Now, 6 months after getting the replacement, my player has consistant problems accessing ""special features"" on various disks...video distortion while playing the second half of various disks...and won't let me play the last two episodes of any of my X-Files Season One disks. I am disgusted with RCA. I'll never buy another product from them again. I should have bought a Toshiba."
1,Stay Away From RCA DVD,"Stay away from RCA DVD players-the player which I have owned for 2 years has broken (despite my going to extreme steps to take care of it), and just now, I am discovering that many other people are complaining of the same problems with their RCA player. Movies will not play all the way through, and the chapter search just goes bersek when you try to use it. By the way, the RCA people are of no help when you call customer service-all they tell you is that it will cost $170 just to have it looked at (when I could practically buy a new player for that price). As soon as I get the money, I'm buying a Sony Player, which is what I should have gotten to begin with."
3,You get what you pay for,"With a low budget to start with, I wanted a reliable DVD player that would also play my CD's. I researched several on line and in stores and finally decided upon the RCA5220P model .... Not owning any DVD discs, I rented several from Blockbuster Video and much to my dissapointment, the discs were not compatible. My Staurday night was very much a no go because of this. However, RCA hotline walked me through the process of re-setting the unit which corrected the problem. I was excited the start to watch my movies only to find out that each movie I put in, every so often, the picture would freeze. When it returned, it would skip over several scenes. This totally annoyed me but again RCA sent me a disc cleaner, it seems to be working but should further problems continue the item will be returned to Amazon. I would nto recommend this product, spend a little more money and get a better model."
3,"Great Customer Service, but a cheapo DVD Player","I bought the last version of this player, and it works fairly well. I had it for about 8 mos, and it broke, but when I called for service, they cross-shipped me a refurb one, and I used the same box and sent the old one back. No hassles. It's a cheapie dvd player though, My panasonic has more features. This RCA one pauses a while between layers, and sometimes I get those squares on the screen like the video can't keep up."
2,It Just DIED,Received this DVD Player as a gift and it worked pretty good for about a year. Inserted a DVD last week and it just died. Took it to an RCA certified repair shop for repair and was told that when they called RCA for schematic info they were told not to attempt repair. Repairman said he was given a 1-800 number for me to call and for an outrageous amount of $$ I could send it to RCA for repair/replacement. What a great service policy.
4,"Easily put, it's a good DVD player","I read some of the other reviews, and I was shocked to hear what types of problems they have had with their RCA DVD. I've had mine for 8 months now, and I have not received any errors or technical problems at all. It hasn't had problems reading high end discs like The Matrix, and as for over heating, well mine still has to get excedingly warm first. For the price this DVD is probably the best out there, but it doesn't have all the bells and whistles some of the other ones have. My advice is, if you are looking for a DVD player and you are on a budget, then this is your machine, but if you can go with a better model, do it."
3,Filled with UPS and Downs!,"I bought this DVD player last Christmas from a department store. I always liked RCA. I had no problems with the DVD for a few months and I liked it, it had good features but missed zoom, and the menu screens were easy to get around and the glossry was a nice touch. But then it started making a high pitch noise that sometimes became louder than the movie I was plaing on my Dolby Digital theather system I used. Then the Disk Tray would not come out the whole way and would get stuck. It made noise from the beggining but this noise was crazy. The manufcr. would not do anything for me. I would have to pay for the shipping to get it fixed and for labor. I did not get it fixed and am currently shopping for a new one with a better Rep. I don't recommend shopping for the lowest price. Because the most important thing is not features, but if it works and if the thing breaks, is the warranty going to help you if it is not just a 90 day or one year parts. Look around, Buy smart!"
1,It sucks!!!!!,"This attempt at low cost digital video is just the type of propaganda that you would expect from a company trying to meet standards set by the front runners in the field of digital video. In the future, you should try to surpass your competition. Although I am an avid RCA consumer, I am at this time reluctant to purchase this product, for the simple fact that i am accustomed to top of the line performance from your company."
3,Their Turning Point,"Metallica's fifth album called ""Black"" or just ""Metallica"" was the turning point in their carriere. Their music style changed very much. Now there was less riffs in the songs than in the first four albums. Also there was more peaceful songs.""Enter Sandman"", ""Where I May Roam"", ""Sad But True"", ""Don't Tread on Me"", ""Through the Never"", and ""Of Wolf And Man"" are pieces of the old times. There's now ballads ""The Unforgiven"", ""Nothing Else Matters"", and ""The God That Failed"". Then there are some strange songs that many of fans even never listen to...""Holier Than Thou"", ""My Friend of Misery"", and ""The Struggle Within""...that drumming is so annoying that I sometimes consider to throw this album away from the window. The lyrics are also different kinds of...now there's not so much songs about the politics and government and that kind of stuff. Now there's strange topics...many of them say nothing to me.Stars: Enter Sandman, Of Wolf And Man, Through the Never"
3,"At this point in metallica's career, ""Nothing else Matters""","At this point in metallica's career, ""Nothing else Matters"" except the cash and publicity. I wouldn't recommend this cd to anew listener to metallica, instead go pick up a copy of Ride the Lightning. The black album did have some rememorable riffs such as sad but true, the unforgiven, and of course the mtv-overplayed enter sandman, but not worth buying if you have not heard the best of metallica. Saying this i would only recommend this album if you already have metallica's first four albums."
3,Good but heavily overrated,"Metallica's 5th album is held in high regard but there are some moments on the album that really hinder it froming getting a higher score. The first half of the album is awesome - It's great commericial metal. That in itself, might be a slight oxymoron but the music is enjoyable. After the 5th track, the cd begins to dip in quality. Nothing else Matters and Struggle within are great, though. Metallica first's albums are great, but this one does have some serious low points. It does fill like a collection of singles and filler. Yet, the good music is solid enough to stand on its own. If you can look past the reputation this cd has then you may be able to enjoy it more."
5,"Black Album, Excellent cd. A Must Have!!","Well theres not much to say xcept. This is Metallica at their prime. They took their thoughts, feelings and emotions, and made one hell of a great f**king cd!! Guitar work is excellent as always, and drums are precise, bass is louder than on all of their last cd's, and Jason Newsted's membership to the band was the best thing scince Cliff! This cd gives credit to all member's instead of just the guitar and drums."
5,"a life force, this CD essential to living","The energy in these compositions as performed by Metallica is a life ingredient.I once went for 3 days without needing to eat,living on the endorphins this cd invokes. Whenever I feel myself lagging, I hit the play button again.Cheers,Misty"
3,The lyrics will make you cringe,"I'm not a hardcore Metallica fan. I like the musicianship on this album a lot, I like the vocal style, etc.But the lyrics are painfully bad. The album sounds, for the most part, like something that a spoiled middle school brat would write. And the worst part is that most of the lame lyrics are in the popular songs, chiefly ""Nothing Else Matters"" and ""Unforgiven."" In those two gems (musically, they actually are gems) we're treated to lines like ""Couldn't be much more from the heart"" and ""You labeled me so I label you... I dubt the 'Unforgiven'"" There are numerous other examples, but you get the point.If lyrics affect your opinion of an album at all, you might want to read up on this one before buying it, because you'll actually feel your IQ drop if you sing along. If lyrics don't matter to you that much, then you'll appreciate the musicianship and quality of this album."
2,Shame,"I bought this album after listening to and loving the two albums Mater Of Puppets, and ...And Justice For All. I went to HMV with this CD in mind, because I had heard Enter Sandman, Sad But True, and Nothing Else Matters on the radio and liking them. I bought this album despite the fact i had heard that this was the album Metallica sold out. Well, let me tell you, they did sell out. I preffered Metallica when they played 8 minute masterpieces, not 4 minutes of mainstream crap that ANYONE can say they like. I hate it when people say they like Metallica when all they have ever heard are the Black Album, St. Anger, or anything off the Load albums. If you want REAL Metallica, then buy anything before the Black Album. The first four albums are incredible. Don't buy this one.GOOD MUSIC: Mushroomhead, In Flames, Lamb Of God, Meshuggah, Pre-Black Album Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera, Killswitch Engage, Fear Factory... the list goes on.Keep ShreddingJack Metal"
1,Metallica's Fall,"This CD, simply put is horrible. Enter Sandman has incredibly weak lyrics and is a piece of crap that sets the tone for an album that is incredibly weak and not heavy from begining to end. The fact of the matter is that Metallica sold out and every song on this album is a pop-rock piece of crap. I reccomend you buy Slayer's Reign In Blood, or one of my personal favorites, Megadeth's Rust In Peace. Megadeth is going to re-release their first 8 albums on July 27 so you can but it remastered. Those two albums are true metal masterpieces, unlike this overrated trash."
5,Best Album Out!!!!,This has the best songs Metallica has ever written. I would recommend this album over any other album out by Metallica.
2,Enter Sandman... literally!!,"Wake me up when it's over...It's hard to believe this is the same band that played ""Kill 'em All"", ""Ride the Lightning"" & ""Master of Puppets"". I can see why James ended up in rehab; he probably listen to it!"
2,The Begining of the end,"First of all, the album is called ""Don't Tread On Me"", I don't count myself as a Metallica fan but for god's sake I know what it's called. Now that I got that out of the way, I really dug the sounds of basically all the albums that came before this one, and some of the songs on ""DON'T TREAD ON ME"" were good, but this is from my perspective the last good Metallica album, and it's not even that good. I mean ""Load"" and ""Re-load"" were a complete abortion, but this one was at least ok. Call them ""sell-out"", say they lost the ""soul of the music"", ""they got too old to play REAL metal"" ""when James quit the booze he lost his edge"" whatever, I don't care how you chose to put it. The fact of the matter is ""DONT TREAD ON ME"" is where the sucking started. Once more, just to make sure I drove that home, THE NAME OF THE ALBUM IS ""DONT TREAD ON ME""! Get it right you so-called ""fans""."
5,PURE GENIUS!,"Metallica has done it again. Only they could pull off an album combining a world famous symphony and metal/hard rock. Every Metallica fan should own this one! I was very nervous about buying this CD and to be honest thought that Metallica and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra sounded lame, BOY, was I wrong. I haven't stop listening since I bought this album They orchestra is excellent and they compliment Metallica in all the right places. Enjoy this musical experiment because it works very well and sounds great."
3,A Radio Classic,"Black did not top the first four records but what album ever has? I missed the long songs that went off on a tangent that the 80's stuff brought. This one is more of your typical Intro, Verse, Chorus, Verse, Chorus, Solo Bridge Extro album. In that regard the song writing is somewhat boring. It's good but I find it hard not to compare it to their older stuff. If it were a different band putting this out i would have looked higher upon the song writing. Some decent leads from Kirk. I think the last 4 songs make this record"
3,not there best but good,"it is not metallica's best but its still goodand also to that moron that wrote 3 one star reviews on this you need to shut up, grinch or whatever your name is face it your a moron."
4,"An excellent album, it should be in every house hold.","Let me tell you this, you know that you have an album worth listening to when every where you look it's being played.The lyerics are exceptionly well written and the instruments don't drownd them out.This is an album for any fan of Metallica."
5,AWESOME!!!,"This is without a doubt the BEST Album ever made. Not only Metallica's best, but the best in general. Every song is a hit and you will want to listen to it over and over again. For anyone who appreciates great music, regardless of the genre, this should be a part of your collection. Buy it today!!!"
5,It rocks!!!!!,"This is truly their best album ever.Now I loved Load,Reload,and all their others but this one takes the cake.There isn't a bad song on the whole thang.After hearing just a few songs you'll wana get up and break something.If you don't like it there's something wrong with you!"
5,Last great metallica album.,"Metallica ruled. The black album was the last great metallica cd. The band changed between ...And Justice for all and the black album. You can see the band maturing. Their songs get shorter, and the pop value is there. They still kick all $#@ though. However, when load, thier next album came along, They began to weaken. While metallica's current music is better than most pop crap, (all pop crap) if you want real Metallica, buy MASTER OF PUPPETS. The black album (or anything after it) would be a good choise for people who aren't real metal fans, and I must reccomend it to people who are real metal fans as well."
5,BEST METALLICA CD EVER BUY IT!!!,"SOLD MILLIONS OF COPYS I FEEL IT IS THE NUMBER ONE CD. IT HAS MY FAVORITE AND MANY OF MY FRIENDS FAVORITE SONGS ENTER SANDMAN ,SAD BUT TRUE AND THE UNFORGIVEN BEARLY BETTER THAN THE HEAVIEST ALBUM KILL EM ALL. NOT THERE HEAVIEST ALBUM BUT IT IS THE BEST ALBUM I REALLY RECCOMEND BUYING IT. GREAT ELECTRIC GUITAR, DRUM BEAT AND GREAT VOCALS. ALL 16 SONG ARE GREAT IF IT HAD SANITARIUM (FROM MASTER OF PUPPETS)IT WOULD BE THE PERFECT ALBUM."
5,Metallica's venture into the mainstream creates a classic,"Yes the songs are shorter. Yes the riffs aren't as structured as past Metallica songs. Yes their thrash sound is gone. Yet the Black Album is one of Metallica's best. The riffs aren't as fast paced or in your face thrash, but every song is very melodic, and it does want to make you bang your head. The Black Album is great, but it doesn't quite make up for future releases ""Load"" and ""ReLoad"" (""Garage Inc."" more than makes up for them). The Black Album is a master work, and no Metallica collection is complete without it."
3,This one is up and down,"I have mixed feelings about this album. It has some good songs on it but they don't really compare to old metallica. Most say that Load is the album on which metallica turned sour. I would agree, but you can see the beginnings of it here. Buy it, and recognize it as the last half decent Metallica album."
5,Very good to start a collection,"This album was the first of Metallica's that I purchased. I became an instant fan and since have aquired five other CD's from their collection. I am very happy with this album. Other albums of interest can easily be determined by preferred songs from this title. For instance, anyone who enjoys such songs as ""The Unforgiven"" and ""Enter Sandman"" (as I do) may find releases like ""Master of Puppets"" and ""Ride the Lightning"" appealing. This is a very good first for anyone who is determined to begin a Metallica collection of their own."
5,Simply one of the greatest cds ever.,"If given adequate finances, I would have encouraged Jaymz and company to release every song on here as a single at the least. Kirk Hammet had some of the best and most difficult guitar riffs ever employed by a guitarist since Jimi Hendrix, recorded on this very album. Not to mention each song was more meaningful and understandable that anything they've ever written. Im just glad this album wasnt a rare like Acoustica or Live Sh*t. I along with the rest of the United States would have missed out on one of the greatest albums in the history of music."
4,A Must-Have for Metallica Folks,"This is the album which defined the Metallica I came to love. This is the one that differentiated them and made them special. ""Enter Sandman"" is the quintessential Metallica piece."
3,A sign of worse to come,"Not bad for what it is but this album is not metal. This signified a change in sound where Metallica once were leaders of the big four, but then went on to chase album sales. There are some catchy songs, but if you are into their earlier stuff then the chances are you won't like this album as its very different to when Cliff had control of the band."
1,The decline of metal,"Few alblums disgust me as much as Metallica's self titled release. Certainly, this piece of garbage does mark the beginning of Metallica's enterence into mainstream music-and its terrible. Metallica's Metallica is a horrendous amalgum of slow songs and scattered metal interludes (none of which exceed 1 minute) which fans of the metal genre should consider a slap in the face."
1,Avoid this and St. Anger,"Wow...talk about the ""Black Album"" - more like the ""We sold out Album"". They found some great acclaim with the song ""One"" on the AJFA album, continuing with their great thrash tradition. So what do they do? They totally CHEESE out with this album. I agree with the one guy above; this album sucks ass. If your just trying Metallica, I suggest ""And Justice for All"" and any previous album. ""Garage Inc."" is exceptional - the covers rock! I personally like the albums after the ""Black Album"", with the exception of ""St. Anger"" - If there was a way to get worse, they accomplished it with this one."
1,Worst DVD-Audio Mix,This is the worst DVD-Audio sound I've ever experienced.Better stick to the Stereo CD.
4,Yes it IS underated,"The Black Album is underated, but is still a great album. If you already own all of Metallica's stuff before this then you should definately check it out. It is no where near as mgood as any of their previous material but is a really great listen. If your a Metallica fan you should probably own this album."
3,This is Masterpiece??????,"This is their first selling out. Changing producer, making songs shorter and sound slippery, they might have been satisfied. But where the hell are the anger, power and directness? They got popular and lost core fans. I am not saying this is waste or things like that. But it is like losing a good friend and getting big flirt instead. I miss their old 80s style."
2,Metallica's Decline,"Some say this is the greatest achievement by Metallica, those people are not true metal fans, this is when Metallica turned their backs on their true fans who where with them ever since 1983 when they had no money and no kind of corporate backing but put out awesome music, ok maybe I'm being a little to harsh this album does have some ok tunes like Sandman and Holier Than Though, but overall this album is a complete back stab to the real metal community..."
1,The decline of Metallica,"Following a lackluster ""...And Justice for All"", they follow up with this drivel. i admit, i bought it. i loved it.But, Kill 'Em All and Master of Puppets remained in rotation in my CD player. This album, over time, proved NOT to be timeless like the older albums. Metallica had proven how long they prayed at the altar of the record industry. They sold out. They abandoned us who considered ourselves fans."
1,Sell Out,"There are 2 kinds of Metallica fans, pre-black-album and post-black-album. And that is because this album marked the death of Metallica and the birth of just-another-heavy-metal-band. By any other band, these songs would have been awesome, but by the band that built they're fan base on bludgeoning, epic(in content and length)songs, this was a total and complete sell out. Shorter songs, commercialized lyrics, horrific solos...it's been 10 years since its release but because the let down was so immense, I can remember it like it was yesterday."
1,The start of Metallica's downfall!!,"Not as bad as Load and Reload but highly commercial. Nothing original, only catchy hard rock tunes. For good Metallica get ...And Justice For All, Master Of Puppets or Ride The Lightning. Even my mom is starting to like the new Metallica albums, it's getting scary. Sell outs!!!!"
5,Possibly the most highly underrated album ever!,"For most of the ""Old School"" Metallica fans this album was considered a huge disappointment. And widely considered the beginning of a huge downward spiral for the band. I will never begin to understand why? This album is yet another masterpiece for Metallica. So they slowed things down a bit. So what, This album is still better than 99% of the crap that's coming out nowadays. 15 million fans can't be wrong, Highest selling Metallica album EVER!"
4,Metallica - self-titled {aka The Black Album} (Elektra),"Review no. 1195. Don't believe I've ever covered a disc on Amazon with THIS many other reviews. I don't CARE what any other old school Metallica fans, followers, die-hards, etc. think about this CD. I've always liked it from day one. Tracks I just might never grow tired of hearing are ""Sad But True"", ""The Unforgiven"", the power-house rocker ""Wherever I Shall Roam"", ""Of Wolf And Man"" and ""The Struggle Within"". As many of times as I've listened to this disc, I never once felt it was all THAT commercial. Maybe a little, but still good enough to appeal to fans from the beginning. I start listening to Metallica right after the release of 'Ride The Lightning'. Obviously recommended."
2,Not a classic by any means,"I was 11 when this came out and I bought this and Justice at the same time. I was new to metal and I was a kid but I knew I was listening to Justice constantly while I struggled to get beyond the third track here (it was cassette.) If you liked well played thrash or any kind of music, it boggles the mind why you would want this stuff that gets boring after a few listens. Roam, Struggle, God that failed, Through the never are just filler. I loved Sandman back then, but I liked Smells like teen spirit too."
2,sad,"If cliff was alive when tallica wrote black album he'd probably laugh in their face. The album as a whole blows. A select songs on it are good, ie my friend of misery, unforgivin, through the never and struggle within. Enter Sandman is the most overrated piece of crap song i think i've ever heard (prior to hearing st anger) Load and Reload were worse, and words cant even express how bad st anger was. This was the album that started the mighty Metallicas downfall. You cant go from Master Of Puppets, Disposible Heros, Dyers Eve and such to Enter Sandman, or Mama Said... sad what once was the forrunner of thrash metal has come to."
2,Sterile,"Ah, Metallica's ""breakthrough"" CD. Yes, how wonderful it was that this great band learned how to ""pare its excesses"" and focus on ""tight song structures.""Uh, hello? I LIKED the excess on Metallica's albums. That's why they were great; they made the excess work for the music, instead of against it. This CD, called the ""Black Album,"" is just a dozen songs with riffs stolen from Tony Iommi and lame nursery rhyme lyrics. Sure, Hetfield's vocals only keep improving, but if I want great singing I'll listen to Elvis.Maybe if half these songs hadn't been overplayed so much on the radio and MTV, I might like them. But that's not the case. This is boring arena rock, unsurprising and sterile."
3,Metallica lost it years before this release..,"I am one of many who believe that Metallica simply lost it after Burton died. Their songs lost that epic feel (not so much in terms of length) and this album was the second step. The first step which showed Metallica's limitations without Burton was justice and how every song sounded so much alike. In addition their was NO and I mean NO bass on that album leading to the songs sounding similar. Load and RE-load proved Metallica was through. People have to understand that 3 good albums is an accomplishment in itself. Metallica has been living off of the rep of it's first three albums for 14 years now, wake up people. It's a thought of mine as to how Metallica would have progressed and what material they would of produced if Mustaine and Burton were still in the lineup; without a doubt far superior to this alubm and the loads...."
2,this is metallica?,"any long time fan of metallica will tell you this is not a metallica album. It IS a Bob Rock album. The mix is good, the songs are catchy, simple, commercial, and short. All in all a great album for any other band. But in no way, shape, or form does this album compare to the four LP's that preceeded it. When metallica changed their image they should have changed their name to possibly the cobra logo on the black album & they could call themselves ""the artists formally known as metallica"""
3,Metallica - It takes time.,"Pros: Last decent Metallica album, still musical and heavyCons: I smell change in the air...If I had reviewed this album when I first got it almost a decade ago, I would have said how much I hated it. But now, after hearing what Metallica puts out now, this album truly is the end of a metal era, and should be treated as such. You could hear the changes coming in the songs like ""Sad but true"", but some of that classic Metallica remained in tracks like ""The God that Failed"" and ""Of Wolf and Man"". I appreciate this album more today than I did when it was new, but it is still a far cry of the Metallica of old. You are better off with pre-""the black album"" releases from this metal group. But it isn't a bad addition to any collection either.NOTE: Review written Oct 12 '99"
4,Metallica Reveiw,"This is imo Metallica's break out album ""enter sandman"" is one of the best songs i have ever heard from Metallica that is why they get 4 stars from me"
3,Overrated,"Metallica's 1991 ""epic"" album, which in my opinion is so far overrated, the album rates nothing like the prior effort (1988's ""...and justice for all"") the album's highlights would have to be unforgiven, nothing else matters, god that failed, my friend of misery, the struggle within, and holier than thou. Other than that the songs are listenable but mediocre, although i do not assuage you from steering away from this album, it is a good album, but does not live up to what i expect."
4,"Great Album, Not Their Best","Metallica's self-titled album was a monumental release for the band, but wasn't thier greatest musical achievement. While this album introduced them to a whole new group of fans, die-hard fans had been listening for a long time previous. Die-hard fans will also view this album as a a fantastic release, but will not let it surpass their other albums as no. 1. I highly recommend this album, but I recommend more that you seek out their earlier albums first."
5,You really want this album!!!,"This is a master piece of the metallica's music, you can feel the power of the album when you play ""Enter Sadman"" and listen the heavy songs like ""Sad But True"", ""Don't Tread on Me"", ""Through the Never"" and ""Of Wolf and Man""; or you can listen the slow and melodic songs with a fantastic guitars like ""Nothing else Matters"" and ""The Unforgiven"". You can enjoy all the songs and feel the music and the instruments (The bass of ""My friend Of Misery"" awesome)... all the metallica's fans needs this album."
5,Flat-out Amazing!,"This album is consistently in the top 20 on Billboard's Pop Catalog chart for best selling albums over 2 years old...and for good reason. Sure, we've all heard the brilliant hit singles such as Enter Sandman, Nothing Else Matters, Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, Sad But True, etc. But this album is much more than that...its lesser-known tracks like The God That Failed, Holier Than Thou, and My Friend of Misery shine just as bright as their radio-played counterparts...and the tracks I didn't mention are stellar in their own right. So basically, I'm saying this an absolutely flawless album...a masterpiece by one of today's premiere bands. Every fan of rock/metal truly owes it to themselves to have this album!"
3,?????,why is it that people say st anger is awful when it is much better than this. this is no more heavier than st anger. in my opinion and justice for all is their best work from there downhill. then st anger was released and it is very good. people should actually give it a try instead of saying that its horrible buy the black album or master of puppets.
3,The last real Metallica release,"Here's the good- guitars are godzilla sized. Jason'sbass can be heard on the disc and it sounds sweet.Lars' drums sound even more perfected on here. Kirkhas some shining moments with his trademark wah tone.THE BAD- Where to start. Lars sounds like he fell asleepbehind the kit on parts of the cd. Where's the complexitythat made this band famous to begin with? What's with thepop songs? The begining of the end for James' thoughtprovoking lyrics. There's alot of hits and misses lyricallyon here.The Ugly- The most non threatening metal lp ever- what doesthat say for Metallica? Not much. I still respect Metallicabut I have to agree with some that this is the most blatantlycommercial lp of the bands career and lacks the grit ofprevious releases.Overall- a couple of good tracks- ""SAD BUT TRUE"" & ""HOlIER THAN THOU"", the okay songs- ""STRUGGLE..."" & ""THROUGH...""- the rest just bores me to no end. STill not as terrible as Load but lowersthe bands standards."

EXIT- METALLICA ENTER- ROCK STARDOM."
3,Mediocre,This album was a continued fall into heartless and more mechanical music that Metallica has continued to produce ever since Justice.
2,Ugh.,"Metallica's worst album for all their early fans. Very slow and moody. It has some good riffs, but most of the album has been very MTV-ized and overplayed. END"
1,Anyone seen Hetfield's balls? He's lost them somewhere.,"I challenge anyone to listen to this drivel back-to-back with And Justice for All or Master of Puppets and say with a straight face that the Black Album is good. Hetfield used to have ""Kill Bon Jovi"" taped on his guitar. Now he has Bob Rock, Bon Jovi's old producer, and makes ""Slippery When Wet"" sound like Motorhead. It's sad, really."
5,In a Word- METALLICA,"As soon as I heard Enter Sandman, I knew that it would be the best song ever written and it is. This album is the best ever cut by any band! The music is edgy, hardcore, and truly displays Metallica at its finest! Other great songs include, Sad but True, a look a everyday life metal style, Don't Tread on Me, a classic intimidation riff, and Nothing Else Matters, the Metallica of all ballads. If they had to make a ballad, they couldn't have done it any better. This is a flawless album that will never be topped. It _will_ secure Metallica a spot in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!"
3,"OK, but Metallica's worst",I have every Metallica CD so don't think I am guessing or anything. This is a good album but it Metallica's worst. I got sick of a lot of it easily and now all I listen to is the first 5 songs.
1,Enter Sandman Is The Only Good Song!,I'll give this CD 1 star because Enter Sandman is a good song.Other than that I've heard Wherever I May Roam and it is whatmakes Metallica suck. Here's what to get.
2,The official sell-out anthem- Sandman,"Ok, One was a great video, but they should have stopped there. This album is the true turning point of Metallica. Although this album contains many good songs, it shifted to a drastic commercial appeal. There is no need for an album to have 1/2 of the songs end up as singles and vidoes, that is just a cry for coperate attention, and the trade-mark of 3 year bands who are popular after their first album, then realize they [are bad]. Many people love this album and I have no idea why, it is not Metallica's finest work by far."
3,good intro to metallica but their ealier stuff is better,"This album was my introduction to Metallica and for a while I thought it was amazing. Then I bought the four albums that preceeded it and was completely blown away.I'm not going to criticize Metallica for selling out...EVEN THOUGH this commercially strong album followed the incredibly ambitious ""And Justice For All"". Disappointing that the band couldn't raise their ambitions even further but what they did produce was a lean, mean, no nonsense version of their past four albums. The sound IS essentially the same, the only difference is that each song is about 4 minutes long and has only one riff. Great if you're after something more immediate but for the Metal purist this offers nothing that previous albums do not.Still, a very good starting place if you've never heard Metallica before. Just make sure your second purchase is an earlier album (I'd suggest Ride The Lightning) and not the garbage they released after this."
1,EEEkkk!!! Make them stop!!!!!!!,"This is the first and the last Metallica album I will ever buy! My parrot sings better than that John Cougar Melloncamp fellow! Chimpansee's are not free you know that is why this album must have been so expensive to make. But I really did love the group and their music. It was the music and the group that I prefered not like. CHILI CHEESE FRIES!!!!!!!! From bands like Airsupply and Snoop Doggy Dog, their present was felt on this wonderfully diagnostic tribute to industry which made failures of men and heros of everything else in mind! Wow is this the best of nothing else to be seen!!!This album makes a moccery of what it means to be a proud Canadian. As you can clearly see the bird does not fall far from the tree!!!"
1,Bad,"My record skips on every song and it is not because of my record player. The people who cut this new version did not do a good job. It is brand new, but comes warped. Better off to buy an original off of ebay and pay the extra $$$$. I do not recommend this to anyone."
4,A PRETTY GOOD METAL ALBUM,"I'm not really a Metallica fan. I've always liked the Black Album from them which is pretty good with terrific songs in ENTER SANDMAN, Unforgiven, and GOD THAT FAILED. Get this alongwith albums from Dire Straits, Foreigner, Nirvana, GNR, Aerosmith, and Joe Walsh but avoid all albums from awful bands like THEBEATLES, ZEPPELIN, ROLLING STONES, PINK FLOYD, AC/DC, and BOSTONwho suck."
5,Awesome,"Yes, Metallica does sell out...... Every seat every time they play. Metallica is their best album, with songs like don't tread on me and enter sandman, it's awesome! One of the few albums, along with Smash by The Offspring, that you can listen through track 1 to the end without wanting to skip a song. It's GREAT!!"
2,The begining of the end,"After great masterpieces such as Master Of Puppets and ...And Justice For All, Metallica decided to go mainstream, isn't that a synonim for selling out? From fast thrashing songs full of masterfull solos, Metallica turned into another mid-tempo 5 minutes radio songs. Regardless, all that shouldn't matter, the songs are plain ""not-as-good."" Definitely it's a must have, it's also way better than the albums to come from Metallica, but this is the end, of Metallica as a metal band. Don't expect headbanging stuff here. Expect hard-rock. Highlight: ""The Struggle Within"" great intro, great riff, great solo, definitely one of Metallica's most interesting songs. Low: ""The God That Failed"", just not a good song, slow and boring."
2,Love the Music...Dissapointed with the quality,"Excellent cd and won't waste anyone's time reviewing the music. If you are looking at hard rock or heavy metal, you already know something about Metallica.Just wanted to review the DVD Audio aspect of the cd/dvd. To keep it simple, while it sounded better, definitely had more of a feel for each individual instrument, it in no way is a major step up from a typical cd.I quickly tossed my old tapes out the window and bought as many cd's as I could afford when they initially came out. But, after hearing this DVD-Audio representation of Metallica, the chances that I will restock my collection of cd's with DVD-Audio are slim. Oh well...at least I won't go broke!Haven't heard the SACD format yet so maybe there is some promise there."
5,The single greatest Metallica album ever.,"Some say Metallica sold out. Some say this album is their best. This is one of my favorite albums, PERIOD. I also think it is Metallica's best work. You can listen to each and every song on this album without wanting to skip one. It is different from their older stuff, but that makes it better. Just because the songs are shorter and it doesn't sound as hard doesn't mean they sold out. This album is and will continue to be much better than most of the metal out today. I recommend it to anyone who wants hard rock and a few ballads with great vocals. My favorite track on this album is ""Of Wolf and Man""."
3,No title for this album?,"Yes, it is true. Metallica didn't put a title on this one, as though it is their first release.But it isn't. That goes to show what they think of their earlier works [apparently not much].I guess this is the first one they really tried on, and the quality is certainly better. But the number of great songs is limited to only four or so [ENTER SANDMAN, THE UNFORGIVEN, WHEREVER I MAY ROAM, NOTHING ELSE MATTERS].The rest are fillers, and that is why this rates so low. There was real potential to make a classic, yet Metallica settled for material that leaves much to be desired.I mean, how many times can you scream ""Misery"" in the song MY FRIEND OF MISERY? [Buy this one and find out--- you might be amazed]..Anyway, Metallica does deserve credit for finally making some songs that listen well. It's just too bad they didn't make more of them!3 stars is all this one deserves [4 good songs out of 12]."
4,Good metal album,"I think this album is a bit overrated. It has some great songs on it such as ""Enter Sandman"", ""The Unforgiven"" and ""Wherever I May Roam."" But it's definitely not as ""heavy thrash"" as their previous albums - I'm thinking more ""pop metal."" Nevertheless, well written and produced."
2,When Metallica Went POP!!!,This Release is when Metallica decided to leave there true roots and go for the big bucks. This Album appeals to a much broader crowd. So much that even the biggest Poison or Kip Winger fan could enjoy it. Well produced but wimpy & wishy washy compared to any previous Metallica album.
4,Beginning of the End,All I'll say is that this album is not like the previous Metallica albums. It turns in a direction of more pop metal and away from the longer songs. There doesn't seem to be a theme as in previous albums. Also the quality of the tracks are not kept up. Despite this it is still a good album so it deserves 4 stars.
4,Definitely underrated,"Say what you will; I still enjoyed this one. Sure, I still have some mixed feelings about the direction Metallica took with this album and the direction that they COULD'VE taken, but hey, nothing perfect ever lasts.Enter Sandman - 5 starsSad But True - 5 starsHolier Than Thou - 4.5 starsThe Unforgiven - 4 starsWherever I May Roam - 4 starsDon't Tread On Me - 2 starsThrough The Never - 4 starsNothing Else Matters - 4.5 starsOf Wolf And Man - 3 starsThe God That Failed - 4 starsMy Friend Of Misery - 5 starsThe Struggle Within - 5 starsOverall, I recommend this one. Not as highly as their previous stuff, but it's still worth a purchase for metal fans and rock fans alike."
2,Well..,"Okay, so many old school Metallica fans probably hate, its natural. BUt I think none of them got to the seventh track, Through the Never! That is a great song, sure, nowhere near their best, but its a good song. This album has 3 good songs. The majorly overrated Enter Sandman, Holier Than Though (gotta love that riff), and Through the Never (a good metal track). Wherever I May Roam has one good riff, but thats it. Kirk has some terrible solos on this one as well. I'd reccomend passing over this one."
5,"Yo, Yo","This album makes a damn fine coaster, i used for almost 2 years putting everything from soda cans to coffee mugs on it. Absolutely wonderful durability. However somethin with more absorbansy would've been more to my liking. Oh well, i've since broken the disc while using it as a frisbee."
2,begiining of the end,"This album sold so well because the public was so ready for a new release. It was, to me, a major letdown. All metal heads were salivating for that record. It had been almost 4 years since ""Injustice for All""! The mainstream was also ready to embrace the band and Metallica knew this. The album lacks the creativity of all their other works up to that point. I understand that they didnt want to be a thrash band anymore and that is why I gave the album so many listens. The fact is that MTV can sell them now so they are big. Metallica's musical quality has steadily gone down while album sales go up. It happens all the time."
2,still pretty repellent,"Oof, just accidentally heard ""Enter Blandman.""It brought back, like it was yesterday, the memory of bringing this home from the record store the day it was released, popping it in the cd deck, cranking it, and realizing within 10 min this album simply blows. I don't mean incompetent. Metallica hit exactly the target they aimed for: bland, mawkish heavy pop-rock. Gone, the icily brilliant thrash band. Hello classic rock band. Sure, they picked up a lot of new fans, certainly more than they lost. But I'm one they lost for good."
3,not really that good,"To this date, this is probably Metallica's weakest album. If it's not the entire commercial sound of the album that rubs me the wrong way, it's all the unnecessary plodding tunes such as ""nothing else matters"" or the fake-sounding opening number ""enter sandman"" (check out ""battery"" for a REAL good way to start an album) that drags the music down. To sum up my feelings- the album just feels too much like an intended way to make a commercial album, and not caring about the quality of the songwriting.Well, it has its moments, but it's mainly the vocals that save this album. The guitar playing is unfortunately very bland and uninteresting, in my opinion."
1,CRAP-TALLICA,"Its basically come to this .. a band that was setting standards with metal innovation have fallen behind creatively - and they get rewarded with insane commercial success. So here you have dumb riffs that dont develop and weak songs from start to finish. Put that together with a super-glossy sounding production package and you have the biggest disappointment in music history. This album was created for one reason and one reason alone - sales. If Metallica had retained their integrity, they would have made a real metal album - not this crap."
4,"Sellout album, but still good.","This is a good cd, too bad they had to be stupid and sellout. Enter Sandman is overrated in many different ways. The best 5 songs are- WHEREEVER I MAY ROAM, THE UNFORGIVEN, GOD THAT FAILED, OF WOLF AND MAN, and, DON'T TREAD ON ME."
3,What?,This album is for those who couldn't handle the early stuff. If you like pop metal then this is the album for you. sure there are some really great songs on this album but what happened to the hardened men of metal? its like metallica almost lost a little soul on this one. good songs are 'sad but true' and 'dont tread on me'. 'Nothing Else Matters' is a song that proves my first point...pop metal.
5,ENTER SANDMAN ROCKS!,"GREAT ALBUM FOR THE GREATEST SONG FROM METALLICA, ENTER SANDMAN.IT JUST ROCKS YOUR ASS UP. PLAY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN."
3,The beginning of the end....,"Too bad that the early days of Metallica couldn't last, but they couldn't remain pissed off 19 year olds forever, could they? The new Metallica is not all that bad.... it's just not old Metallica."
3,Metallica Needs A Compilation,"I think this is good but In my opinion, Metallica needs a compilation but with my top ten song, Enter Sandman. But I reallydon't know a lot of their songs, thanks."
4,"Awesome cd, great introspect on The Unforgiven","The Unforgiven is by far my favorite song so far on the cd. It is melancholy and deep, but with still the same sound Metallica is known for. This cd does not disappoint."
3,Overrated,"Sorry to say it folks, but I just don't see this being a great metal album, and it has nothing to do with whether they ""sold out"" or not. The leadoff track, 'Enter Sandman' was of course a big hit, and there are a few other tracks on here that are very good, such as 'Wherever I May Roam' and the hard rock ballad 'Unforgiven'. But almost the entire second half sounds like filler to me, just stereotypical mid-tempo hard rock stuff. Only in isolated moments does this record reach the peaks of aggression that Lightning and Puppets did. Some of this may just be my taste, I really like the old speed-metal material. But after all the hype I heard about this one and how many copies it's sold, I was expecting more."
4,The transitional Album. But still ... good.,"This only gets four stars because there are better Metallica albums. As general music goes, this is 5 stars... easily. The Black album is a simpler, stripped down version of Metallica. The guitar solos are shorter, the topics are less apocalyptic and songs do not last 8 minutes any longer. I prefer the earlier stuff, not because its 'thrashier', but because it is more musically complex and the themes are stronger. However, this is vastly superior to their alternative rock albums (Load, Reload) because the songs are still written excellently. 'Enter Sandman', although simple, is one of my favourite songs because its got a great riff and a cool guitar solo by Kirk. Also, this album is heavy enough to act as a transitional album for those wanting to explore the first four Meatllica albums. Buy this, love it, and then get the awesome 'Master of Puppets'."
5,The LAST Metallica Album...,"...before the band that once stood for liberty and justice for all, but most of all FOR THEIR FANS got replaced by killer money-hungry aliens from outer space. NOT their best album by far, only a newbie fan would say such a thing. A great one nonetheless. When it first came out, the band said it was experimenting with shorter songs and solos. The black album benefits from that experimentation- shorter songs equals more songs equals more variety. You all know the ones made popular by MTV, but their are a bunch of key songs on here that any fan needs to give a good listen to- Through the Never, God that Failed, Of Wolf and Man. Struggle Within also contains one of the most powerful and soulful solos I have ever heard. Despite Metallica being in its 'Old, Fat Elvis' stage as a friend of mine puts it, the real stuff from this album back is still pure gold."
3,where did the passionate feeling in their music go?,"One of the best POP albums of all time, this heralded the beginning of the end for the classic (and imo, real) Metallica. There are still a few fizzling sparks of feeling here and there, but nothing to compare to the nuclear-powered sun of raw, sometimes brutal, sometimes exquisitely sad, but always beautifully potent emotion they once evidenced on the first 4."
5,incredible album,"this is arguably one of the greatest albums of all time. the songs never get old, no matter how many times you hear them...there is always something new to appreciate. agreed, metallica's sound changed radically with this album, but i think it only improved...all the various instruments are clearly heard and integrated into the music while each contributing something worthwhile to the whole...i think this is when metallica really matured as a band, and thus belongs on every music lover's shelf."
5,Call it..... Heavy Metal!,"Metallica is the greatest musical group ever! Bar none! They can explore any new sound and make it into something incredible. The Black Album is what shows how good Metallica is. The lyrics cut through you and the aggression and hard hitting guitar riffs, along with the brilliant drumming of Lars Ulrich and the James Hetfield growls, make this album one of the greatest Rock albums ever made."
4,Good Heavy Metal CD,"This turned out to be Metallica's last really good album to date. Its been 1991 since they put out a really good cd. Load, Reload, Garage Inc., S&M;, and St. Anger are all mostly forgettable. There are some decent songs here and there but overall most of the music is forgettable.But with this album there are several good songs, such as: Enter Sandman, Sad But True, The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, Nothing Else Matters and My Friend of Misery. The only complaint I have on this cd is the over-production by Bob Rock. He made them change around songs and themes to several of the songs, and the result was that most were dumbed-down and ended up sounding too poppy.But in the context of their whole catalogue of music this has to rank as one of their best pieces of work. I would recommend this to anyone who likes rock music in general. Good lyrics, great guitar work and good production all make for a great album."
5,Metallica's Last Killer Classic!!,"I think Metallica's self titled album is very very good as was their last of their classics and was best after great albums like And Justice For All that rocked hard. The song Enter Sandman in my opinion has to be one of the finest songs ever created by them as well as The Unforgiven. My Friend of Misery,Wherever I May Roam,and Dont Tread On Me are other anthems. Highly recommended."
3,good but....,"This album has some great songs, classics, Enter Sandman, Sad But True, The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam and Nothing Else Matters. Then there are others that just don't work, If the album had ended after ""Nothing Else Matters"" it would've been a classic. Some songs are just dull, sound a bit repetitive and don't have the energy or the lyrical mastery of the songs at the beginning of the album. It album could've benefited from being about three tracks shorter its still a solid rock album, not the classic most mainstream rock fans say it is, but still good."
5,The album that influenced many bands,"Many of Metallica's 'fans' (and I use that term loosely) screamed 'sellout' at this album, mainly because it seemed to be their most commercial release, which it was and continues to be, but only because there were 5 singles from this album doesn't make it a bad album. It is actually one of their best.And I can actually state that, since I have practically all of their albums, and I will stick by them as long as I can, refusing to call them sellouts, and I even enjoy St. Anger, so if you think that I will have a biased review about this album, then you can stop reading this right now.The standout tracks for me would have to be Sad But True, The Unforgiven, Don't Tread On Me, Of Wolf And Man, The God That Failed, and the fastest track on here, The Struggle Within.So, if you want to hear to some actual metal as opposed to the nu-metal junk that is infesting the airwaves these days, pick this up."
5,The Dawn of a new Era,"Hands down, the greatest album by Metallica. This is the CD that marked the evolution from all-out metal thrash to progressive thrash. The world's greatest band raised the bar for aspiring metal bands across the globe (Pantera, Slayer, Megadeth, Guns 'n Roses, etc.). The Black Album is a milestone on the path Metallica paved through the music universe."
5,METALLICA IS THE GREATEST METAL BAND EVER,"This album is one of Metallica's best. It may not have the same speed driven Guitars that made them "" Metal gods"", but it is absolutely Metallica at their best. The songs have lost none of the intensity of early Metallica. A big step from their earlier works Metallica still put out adrenaline packed anthems. They may be softer but they still have the sense of something dark and brooding underneath. Every artist must come to a point where their music evolves or fades into obscurity. This album ensured that Metallica will be around for a very long time."
3,The New Era Beggins,"This is not a bad Album, per say, but it's an album that put Metallica on the Radio, anf for true Metallica fans it wasn't what was expected after their previous 4 albums. There are some good songs on there, but I've heard much better music before. A must have for all Metallica hard core fans of their new era, but don't bother otherwise"
3,Nice but could have been better,"Well it's a nice album.But not as good as their albums like ""Ride the lightening"",""...And Justice for all"" or ""Master of puppets"".Well some people may argue this one is better than any of their others.But there r only some songs which come to one's mind like ""The Unforgiven""(one of my fav met songs) and also ""Nothing else matters"".""Enter sandman"" the opening song is good.""The Struggle Within"" is a kinda faster song.""Sad but true"" is good too.But the rest of the songs dont come to one's mind.I wont say this album is bad but it is not met's best effort.Try ride and justice then goto this album.Well this a little mixed review."
4,What a surprise!!,"This DVD was a total suprise...a bunch of head banging metal heads that created a fantastic DVD...who would have thought? This DVD has excellent channel separation, good crisp highs, excellent subwoofer lows, the voices were usually centered and properly mixed, and the rear surround channels had lots of action. I dont care for Metallica's music but was blown away by the quality of this recording. If your a Metallica fan I recommend this with 5 stars. If you dont like their music, I still recommend this with 4 stars."
3,Back in Black!!!!,"It appears the boys from Metallica are Back in Black again!! This is basically the album that started it all for these heavy-metal giants, and the results are certainly astounding!! I remember this album being released during the heart of grunge, as it promptly kicked the butt of every single Seattle band at the time! This is a hard-rockin' album where metal-maestro Hetfield sounds angry the whole way through!! For true metal, this is the album to get."
4,Kings Of Metal,"Metalica were kings of metal when metal was king. Even as they ascended, the seeds of metals destruction were being sown by pointless poseurs and hair bands. Metalica was the real deal, expert playing, angry roaring vocals and well, screechin anger. If metal's your thing, you have found heaven. Fans of more modern bands like Smashing Pumpkins, Stabbing Westward and even Skinny Puppy will enjoy. Especially notable is well known anthem 'Enter Sandman'"
5,A Five Star Experience,"There is certainly much debate amongst Metallica fans, especially the original fans, as to the greatness of this CD. Though it may not be as raw as the earlier CDs, it is one heck of a great rock and roll album. The CD is full of one great song after another. My personal favorite is Wherever I may Roam. Had this been Metallica's only CD/Album, they would have been considered a success. One of the greatest live bands of all time show there skills on this excellent 5 star CD."
5,You like it hard? This is HARD.,"MetallicA has always been a force to reckon with, this album proves this without a doubt. From the incredible force of Enter Sandman to the slower, yet still powerful Nothing Else Matters. Many say this is the greatest metal album ever made, I can't help but agree."
5,One of the greatest hard rock albums of all time; the end of an era.,"You may notice that I said ""hard rock"" and not ""metal."" Once one comes to grips with the fact that this IS a hard rock album, and not metal like the previous four, it can be much more appreciated. This is not ""Justice,"" ""Master,"" ""Lightning,"" or ""Kill 'Em All,"" nor does it try to be.Unfortunately, after this album, whether you considered them hard rock, metal or country, Metallica began to create dull, uninspired poop. :("
2,Where is the bass guitar?,"I put off buying this for awhile - but finally gave in. At least on my system, it sounds like the bass guitar is hardly in the mix. I can hear the bass from the bass drum just fine - but comparing it to my regular CD (and the excellent DVD Video Cunning Stunts) the bass guitar is way down in the mix. This really takes a lot out of the music and makes it sound thin. I don't think I will play this very often."
2,Enter Sandman in the only good song!,"Wow, Metallica really hit rock bottom with this one. No wonder it bombed on the charts. Grant it, it's better than everything they made before it (Master Of Puppets is their worst), but that doesn't merit any respect. Enter Sandman is a pretty good tune, and Sad But True is ok, but it all falls apart after that. The guitar work is simply nueasiating. Check out Megadeath for some true music. If you want a better Metallica album, check out Garage Inc. It's sad, but they're only good when they play other artist's songs."
3,ogay,"I really cant see the obsession with this album, Metallica are a poor mans Iron Maiden. Give me the number of the beast any day.damn yanks."
5,one of the greatest bands on the face of the planet,"i wish more kids would listen to my kind of music(AC/DC,meattalica,nirvana,social d,skinny puppy stuff like that) but unfourtintly most don't and some adults have gone to rap too for those of your who haven't rock on. I don't think this is their greatest album ever(master of the puppets and ride the lighting might be though)BUT STILL FOR ANY MORON TO DIS THIS ALBUM IS JUST PLAIN DUMB!!! damn pepole just don't know a good album when they hear one!"
1,"this album sucks,sad but true!","i bought this when it came out iwas horrified when i listened to it,i threw it off a bridge and watched a truck smash it , metallica died with cliff burton,he would have never played this wussy crap,and they go down hill with each release! this is not the metallica i discovered in 1983,this album sounds like stuff they used to make fun of,no thrash here! avoid at all costs!"
2,Enter sandman is the only good song,I really don't want to listen to too much heavy metal. I'll give this 2 stars because enter sandman is one of my favourite songs of all time and it came out when i was born and rocks. listen to it.
1,garbage gey hate it,okay im so pissed off that people are saying this is a masterpiece its garbage its not a masterpiece if a two year old can play all the song on this album. this is ridiculous i ahte people that say this is metallicas last of the best cause its not ...and justice for all is okay this is gay stuff and this album is junk for all new metal heads do not buy this album it is a comercial gey album with no musical talent what so ever listein to real metallica like kill 'em all ride the lightning master of the puppets ...and justice for all do not waste youre time with this plain old garbage and i cant bealive all the posers that are giving this album five stars you are probably the same people who give great albuyms like hell awaits and kill 'em all and killing is my business...and business is good bad review you all are posers do not try to act like youre real metal heads and do not try to make people follow in youre direction by telling them albums like this one are masterpieces
1,How can some1 like a cd from the group whos vs. Napster,i have no respect for a group who says it hurts cd sales even though the sales are up since napster came out . They have low sales cuz there music is bad and they r old.
3,NO!,"It wasn't their 1st album and it was far from the best. it was good but if u want good metallica try ""Ride the Lightning"" or ""and justice"". Remember: Just because its self-titled doesn't mean it was their 1st. Th@'s all."
5,the best yet,"I'm just having a good laugh at some of the reviews by so called ""fans"". This is THE best metallica album, and to call them a ""sellout"" just cause they happened to sell alot of copies is rubbish. This is full of the best songs, ""sad but true"" would have to be one of the best riffs ever. This cd has it all, and it is everything metallica are about."
3,Metallica in decline,"I was disappointed the first time I heard this, as were other people I knew. This is also the point at which people starting accusing Metallica of selling-out. Metallica countered by saying that it was the mainstream that was moving towards Metallica, and not vice-versa. This is true -- but Metallica were more than happy to accomodate them. I still remember being in a bookstore at the magazine rack looking at the cover of a magazine featuring Metallica and Guns 'N' Roses (whom they were on tour with at the time), and some girl coming up to me and striking up a conversation about how Metallica had sold out.But anyway, this review is of the album, not the band itself. There are some tracks on here that I thought were okay, but nothing fantastic. If you're new to Metallica, I recommend ""Master Of Puppets"" or ""Ride The Lightning"", two classics.I have to add though: does anyone else find it ironic that a band that supposedly hates being labeled chose to name themselves METALlica?"
3,3.5 Stars,"They wouldn't let me do 3.5, so I did 3. Metallica went alternative on this album, which is a stinker, but suprisingly they handle it quite well. The first half is far better than the second half. The first half includes Enter Sandman, Sad But True, Unforgiven, among others. the second half is rather dissapointing with nothing really standout except for Nothing Else Matters and My Friend Of Misery. This was Metallica's most commercially succesful album, due to it being released at the time of the alternative explosion. This album is quite well done, but stay away from their work after this. Their post-black album stuff reeks horribly. This is the last decent Metallica album."
4,Good But Not Great.,"Metallica's 5th studio album, the Black Album or just Metallica is a good album overall. It's not as good as their '80 discography and it's far more accessible than And Justice For All. It was very heavy, technical and under-produced. The Black Album is more mellow and it's more hard rock than thrash/progressive metal. The songs are less complex, very polished and well produced and a more radio friendly and mainstream sound. It's their best selling album to date and it went 15x platinum in The United States. It's not as good as their older albums but Wherever I May Roam is my favorite Metallica song of all time, at least my favorite radio hit."
1,ENTER NAPSTER,"For those of you that think Metallica is a good band and heavy,get alife. Listening to Metallica in this day in age is like listening to Michael Bolton,its not heavy at all,just pure soft rock. Lastly thank you Weird Al Yankovic for making fun of Metallica with the song Enter Napster."
1,"Oversold, Overproduced, Overplayed","It seems that this album was produced to contain 3 or 4 smash hit single songs (Enter Sanmdan, The Unforgiven, Nothing Else Matters) whilst the rest of the disc contains filler material. Thats right folks, this one was made for money.Metallica would never be able to achieve the glory and musical accolades after Cliff Burton's death, so why not cash in ASAP??Real metal is In Flames, Arch Enemy, Dark Tranquility, Nevermore, Carcass and At The Gates"
1,OBVIOUSLY CLIFF BURTON WAS METALLICA,Metallica was never the same without Cliff Burton. What happened?I remember my friend drove up in his car and had just bought this the day of its release.I was in dismay. I was like this is like ACDC. Oh no!It was like the moment when Motley Crue followed up Shout at the Devil with Theater of Pain only they didnt start dressing like girls.That very moment was the end of Metallica for me. They bought into their own hype and did what their label or producer told them to.
3,"Great Music, Poor Album Copy","I was excited at the thought of owning this album on vinyl, but on first spin it skipped left, right, & centre.If you're putting it into a frame, buy it. If you plan on listening to the album front to back without skips and pops...don't."
5,1 STAR RATINGS??? ARE YOU KIDDING?,After reading some of the 1 star reviews i felt compelled to defend this great rock cd. For the record this is not where they started their downfall. This brought them up to their highest. It is so high that after they couldn't keep up with it. every album after just got worse and worse and st anger. listen to every album after this one and tell me again what you think of this one.
2,"Not the original ""black album""...","A certain genius from Minneapolis recorded an album in 1988 with an all black cover...that is the original use of the term ""black album."" Isn't the name of this album Metallica?"
2,Potential But Very Overrated,Metallica from the very beggining had huge potential but never lived up to it. They made some ok songs along the way but never had an entire album that was worth anything. This album is the only one of them all that I think is ok. It's the only one I can listen to and really the only one that is ok all the way through. Still not a huge fan of the album but its the best they did. Overrated but not to bad. Plenty of other bands that are way better.
4,Last true Metallica album.,"Metallica didnt sellout. This Metallica's Heavy Metal stage. All the albums after this are Hard/Modern Rock and THATS when they sold out. The only reason this got 4 stars from me is because it DOES stray away from the original thrashiness that was Metallica. Still a solid Metal album though. Buy it, along with Kill 'Em All, Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets, and . . .And Just For All."
3,Enter SANDMAN,"I love this album for that 1 really great song, Enter SANDMAN...and it is one of my favorites of all time. 3 stars because EnterSandman is the best......BUY IT."
4,good.....but not great,"This album is usually called the ''black'' album.Most people either hate this album or love it.Actually, this album is kind of in the middle for me.Theres no denying that enter sandman is one of the greatest songs of all time,but metallicas first 4 albums were definitley better.Obviously, this is when metallicaentered mainstream.Nothing else matters isn't the best slow song metallica ever recorded,but it probably is the slowest.This album is still awesome, but most metallica fans will be yearning for something more."
5,"MetallicA ""Black"" sounds alot better!!!!","wow, where to begin on this new DVD audio thing!!! For starters this new DVD, totally will make it seem, as though the TallicA guys are in your room playing there music..Vocals from one speaker(usually front) and back up vocals(from back speakers) drums usually from one set of speakers, bass the way it should sound all from a subwoofer...I must say the delays on this DVD are well worth the wait...I can definetly say, that if you give this DVD a spin in your DVD palyer, and have a nice system, you will definetly hear the clarity of the music...I highly recomend the purchase of this DVD by the TallicA guys..."
5,excellent,"""Black Album"" is the one of the best albums of Metallica. it contains""Unforgiven"",Whereever I may roam"",and other lots of excellent songs . If you don't have any metallica casettes or cds, u can start with this.Esp. listen to the songs ""Unforgiven"" and Whereever I may roam."
4,"One of Metallica's Finest, but Still not the Best","Last summer I became a Metallica fan from some of the MP3s i had gotten off the Internet. Soon afterwords I bought The Black Album and immediately loved it. Enter Sandman, in my opinion, is one of the greatest songs ever. Sad But True's rythem is second to none. Despite the early impression of a slow song, The Unforgiven is great. On the whole, The Black Album is an enjoyable listening experience. Although the tempo is slower than their previous albums, this is small handicap. I rank this album third behind Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning. Definitely worth buying."
4,Metallica in their Prime.,"Probably the best Metallica album. Nothing Else Matters is my personal favorite, but probably just because I'm not much of a metal head. But this album is great all the way through, and can entertain even those of us who are not normally into metal. Metallica is truly a creative and artistic force, and they changed music. This is their definitive album, and a must have for all Music fans, regardless of your favorite style."
3,Great Songs Bad Album,"I consider myself an open-minded music fan, so therefore, I am not afraid to say when albums and songs stink - even when they are done by some of my favorite artists. With that said, Metallica is one of my favorite bands. In my opinion, they have great songs, not great albums. On this album I like tracks #1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8. As for the rest of the songs, if you skip them you won't be missing much."
1,Any TRUE fan would throw this into the discount bin!,BAD ! Want to hear where a super group lost all thier talent? Want to hear where they changed everything an desided to sell out ? Well then pick this Cd up. I know music changes an so do groups......but really I think they went a bit over board here....it has been all down hill sence.
2,S-E-L-L--O-U-T,"This would be a great album, if it were done by one of the bands from the 'new' metal scene, but compared to Metallica's earlier standards, it sucks. The talent isn't there. Nothing Else Matters and My Friend of Misery are probably the only good songs on there. I'm not a long time Met. fan, I got the black album before one of their other's. But once I got Master of Puppets, Ride the Lightning, and ...And Justice for All, I realized what I've been missing out on. This album sucks....Load and ReLoad are pure crap. Check out their earlier stuff.Who wants to listen to a sell-out?"
1,ZEPPELIN destroy metallica,"Well what can anyone say about ZEPPELIN? it's the toughest thing anyone can possibly be made to answer. Maybe it's wise to start with the other great human endeavours, the Ancient Greeks, the The European Rennaisance, Beethoven, Einstein. Put these in a melting pot and the end result would stll be vastly inferior to the worst song by Zeppelin. In fact it's false to think of ZEPPELIN as having a worst song. Every ZEPPELIN song is the azimuth of human genius. o the question is not whether anyone gives a rat's @ss whether or not you use your brain but accept it as a FACT.The human mind is simply unable to comprehend the dizzying magnitude of ZEPPELINS genius. It's like trying to comprehend the vastness of the Cosmos. It can't be done. Just trying to comprehend the tiniest fragment of ZEPPELINS talent would make your head hurt. pink floyd aren't even fit to lick Jimmy Pages boots. All hail the Mighty ZEPPELIN!!!"
1,CD cover cracked,When I received the cd the entire case was cracked luckily not the cd itself. They packaged it in just a regular envelope which was probably not the best idea.
1,The Dinosaurs,this album supposebly cause metalica to lose some fans...eh what should i know i don't even listen to metalica..come to think of it...what am i doing here? the only good song was enter the sandman. who is this sandman in which they speak of? friend or foe?
1,Follow The GOD that TRIUMPHED OVER DEATH JESUS,"These Boys lost My respect when they claimed that JESUS failed. Nothing ELSE MATTERS, but the Truth boys, and satan is the god that FAILED Big Time, but has You Buffaloed into believing You can become UNFORGIVEN. Your SANDMAN is satan because You believe him a Winner HA HA, not Hardly. Wake up Metal-Ick-U you can become 4Given if You Really Follow The GOD THAT WON. JESUS. Obey His New Covenant Gospel 2 Thessalonians 1:7-9 2 John 9-11, and drop the god who REALLY FAILED satan Ok."
3,BLACK ALBUM,Please correct me if I am wrong but if memory serves wasn't the BLACK ALBUM originally called SMELL THE GLOVE?
2,Metallica has gotten lazy.,"A Metallica song used to be a work of art. Now, like many great acts that have achieved commercial success, I feel Metallica has just gotten lazy. These new tracks are nothing but neat, packaged, made-for-radio plastic that do not do ""justice"" to incredible talent of all four of the band's members. Metallica continues to be my favorite band of all time, but of their 7 LP's, this is in my opinion their worst, followed by the ""Load"" series."
2,This is Metallica's entrance to mainstream appeal.,"I was very dissapointed with this recording. I am used to thrashing, in your face, heavy and loud Metallica. I must say, this was a big let down. It's great if you've just heard Metallica on the radio for the first time. But, for someone who has followed them since they first got together, it's sad to see that they've sold out to appeal the masses."
3,Black is Metallica's worst album!,"I'd have to place this album as #7 on my list. It has none of the aspects that made Load/ReLoad good, and none of the aspects that made Justice and earlier Metallica good."
5,Metallica's change in style...,"This album is phenomenal, a change of style for Metallica and the new style is somewhat an improvement. This may not be as good as Master of Puppets but non-the-less this is still one of the albums of the decade. Every single song is a classic. Brilliant lyrics, instrument playing and vocals. I also think it is the best production seen on any album. The drums are especially powerful on playback. Simply put: this is a must buy."
5,Metallica - The best band ever,"This CD is by far the best one metallica has to offer. If your just buying it now, you have missed alot."
5,Awesome,My brother has this cd and as soon as I litened to it I thought it was one of the best cd's my brother had I'm into heavymetal my self well you have to buy this cd it will be worth your money Peace OUt
1,Welcome to the world of white college hats...,"and to the world where mall-""metal"" started being played at preppy high school parties. Yup my friends, this is the end for metallica, and where Megadeth gladly took over! This is the album that got preppy football players in their white college hats playing ""metal"" at their lame parties. This is also where you can tell that the only cool member reaming in this horrid, over-rated band is Jason. I would stay in it too just for the money like he did if i wasn't an original member. This also is the begining of pop rock producer bob cock rock. If you've managed to sit thru the lame ass year in the half of selloutica vidoes, you'll see lar$ making fun of their new cd on the part where he goes ""arena rock"". Yup, best to stay away from this kids, get something good like Megadeth, Immortal, Typhus, etc."
1,Beginning of the end.,"I began to listen Met in 1992 and I own every album of Metallica. I think I wasted my money by buying Black album, Load and Reload. But my reason was clear; I had hope that one day they would return to the glory of the past. Their previous works are clearly the best of their time, and a bold turning point for metal. RTL and MOP are extreme masterpieces of metal history. Too sad Cliff passed away, because if he didn't, he would never let this happen. In Whiplash from Kill'Em All, the lyrics go ""We'll never quit cause we're Metallica"" but its SAD BUT TRUE that the band has sold out for more commercial success. If you like metal than listen to Metallica before Selloutica, SLAYER, IRON MAIDEN, BLIND GUARDIAN, MANOWAR,HAMMERFALL and ICED EARTH. These bands are the current shredders.:( Life it seems will fade away,/drifting further every day./ Things not what they used to be, missing one inside of me..."
1,The epitome of selling out,"When you go from an overated pseudo-thrash band to an overrated radio rock band in a matter of one album, and sell millions in the process, you know you've done something wrong (or right if your $$$Metallica$$$). This album pretty much killed the Bay Area scene. I no longer have any respect for these sellouts.Look into Kreator, Vio-lence, or Testament if you want FAR superior real thrash bands."
2,I dont like it,"This is the album that Metallica decided to abandon their thrash roots and go all radio-rock and everything. If you are an avid radio rock listener you probably love this album and all that but I just dont like it. Some of the songs are decent but nothing special. There is no classic 8 minute long metal anthems on here like ""master of puppets"" or ""creeping death"". What we get is 4 minute long, slow radio friendly rock. Well if thats your bag me giving this album a 2 star review wont change your mind but I just thought I should let my opinion be known"
3,The swansong album,"Sure it's a classic rock album no doubt about it. But it's nowhere near the band's best work and its success was just as much a matter of ""right place, right time"" as it was quality. There are a few solid Metallica tracks on TBA, but some filler material as well, which knocks this release down a notch IMO. It was their last listenable album, everything since then has been total garbage."
5,"Good Album, and this 5.1 mix is AMAZING!","Everybody knows Metallica - Black Album, ITs a great album, not he best from Metallica IMO, but very very good indeed (personally I like Master of Puppets and ...and Justice for All more).Listening to this album in surroind hi rez audio makes this album so much better. Its sound fuller as it is greatly mixed.I have to say The Unforgiven and Nothing else matter benefit the most form the rear speakers, but this doesnt mean the rest sounds mellow.Sad but true sounds brutal, Holier than thou makes you want to jump all around the room, and Of Wolf and Men sounds as hard as a kick in your stomach.If you own a DVDA player and a surround reciever, buy this album. If you dont, buy a Palyaer and a reciever. It is worth every penny!"
4,Great Heavy Metal Record,"A lot of people hate on this record, which isn't justified. This album is heavy and full of great songs. It may not be in the league of Kill 'Em All, Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets, but not very many records are! Front to back every track is good and this is money well spent, ROCK ON!!"
5,one metallica's best albums,"The Metallica Black Album depicts a different style in contrast to its precedences. The black album presents a slower but heavy sound and lyrics which is unimaginatively good, as the band was able to create the same quality of awesomeness despite style changes."
5,"Metallica, The legend","If you are a person who enjoy good music and exciting music, you mut like Metallica. Especialy this cd, that has some of the musics that made Metallica what is today... Like Nothing else matters, One, and others...."
1,Tried IT DON'T LIKE IT,"Rock fans love to critize Backstreet Boys, even writing nasty reviews of their songs. So I thought let me listen to Metallica rock fans are always telling BSB fans try them and you will see what REAL music is....lol. OH MY GOD. if this is what rock fans call ""real"" music well I think your brain cells have been desensitized by the very loud guitars and the lousy voices. And what are the lyrics, for half the time I can't hear them, come on ppl if you rock fans like this crap listen to it I would bet more than half of rock fans have to be high when they listen to this crap. But for me I will continue to enjoy the smooth, melodic, harmonizing of the Backstreet Boys."
1,Nirvana Nevermind is better,"I was just listening to this CD, and thought how dangerous this album is. I mean that singer, he just can't sing, this is just dirty, dangerous, loud, angry metal. I mean I like the drummerLars but the rest of the CD is just noisy. The only good song isEnter Sandman. I like Nirvana Nevermind better because Kurt Cobain is much better singer even though he screams some. I thinkthere were more songs I liked on that album such as Smells Like Teen Spirit, Come As You Are, and In Bloom. This is just stupid lousy album. Go get Nirvana Nevermind and any album from Dire Straits, Guns N' Roses, or Green Day insted.PS. This music is gonna make you cry."
5,Intergalactic Metal,"This album is the consensus peak performance of Earth's chosen representative in the Intergalactic Metal Band Competition.If you wonder what it was that hid under your bed when you were a child frightened of the dark, listen to Enter Sandman. You've been warned: don't neglect to sleep with one eye open.If you're angry at the world--perhaps, paradoxically, because of something you've done to make it a little worse, and you need cleansing--listen to Unforgiven. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone.If you want a little perspective on the shortcomings of the rest of the world, listen to Nothing Else Matters. What is it that does matter? By process of elimination, nothing but the pure but harsh sounds coming from your speakers--for this moment, at least.But most of all, if you want to have your posterior rocked off, listen to the disc. It will never, never fail you."
5,Amazing,"I love this album! it's the first Metallica Cd i ever bought. the guy actually searched the entire store for me so i could buy it. i love the songs ""the unforgiven"" and ""Though the Never"" i paid 30$ for this CD and it was and is well worth it. Its got alot of meaning and depth to it. its about life and why we live and things of that sort. a very well made and worth while album...."
5,One of the best Metal albums of all time,"Although not as good as Master of Puppets, the Black album continues where And Justice for All left off, except this time you get to hear Jason Newstead's talented bass skills. This modifies Metallica's sound from pure speed and thrash to a more hard rock sound, creating their most creative album to date. Do yourself a favor and check out one of the most distinct albums of all time. This album proved to the mainstream media that Metallica was here to stay."
5,All I Can Say Is Wow!,"I would never classify myself as a Metal fan. I like darkwave, gothic music, and a little punk/death metal for the most part, mixed with almost anything from the 50s-70s. So, when I heard this really cool song at a friend's house I begged to know what it was. The response was ""Enter Sandman. C'mon."" That caught my attention since I am a devout Sandman/Vertigo fan. I asked who sang it, and got told I was the biggest idiot in the world-that's Metallica. It turns out I was. This album is incredible. The songs are less intense in some ways than on earlier albums, and this brings to light both the lyrics and James' voice, which is at times seductive and at others positively growling. I can honestly say that I have seen the um light(?) and that is to say that I respect Metallica and love this album-every song except track 3. If you don't have it, get it, NOW!!!"
5,"my metallica ""metallica"" album review","Overall I think that this is one of the best album metallica has come out with. I would recommend this album to all metallica fans. There are a total of 12 songs, including; The Unforgivin, Enter Sandman, and of Wolf and Man. This is just a few great songs of this album. If your parents don't let you buy c.d's/tapes that have profanity in them, this one doesn't,so get out and buy it. If you do not have any metallica albums, get this one for your first."
3,the last good one,this is the last good record they made I dont know what else i can say that hasnt been said already.
3,some good spots but mostly boring and monotonus,"there's not much to say about this album, it has osme good spots but most of the songs are the same and boring. a couple great songs but then the others kinda suck so basically a really mediocre album."
4,black,not metallica's best album but still a very good album letting bob rock produce the was the right move to take because the the songs are more stronger than previous albums lars's drumming is brillant the unforgiven has one of the best solos ever heard as well as enter sandman sad but true has a brillant riff nothing else matters is a brillant song.
5,The second best,"This album is Metallica's second best album to date. With a big variety of songs like ""Enter Sandman"", ""Of Wolf And Man"", and ""The Unforgiven"", this is Metallica's most varied album before the Load twins. ""The Unforgiven"" is the best written song on the album, and ""Enter Sandman"" was the first Metallica song I ever heard in my life and still is as good as the first time. Buy this, just about everyone into or even intrigued by metal/rock."
5,A legendary album. No rock fan should be without this !,"This is perhaps one of the greatest rock albums ever written. Any rock fan will appreciate each of the equally brilliant tracks.Anyone who's opinion differs is obviously NOT a rock fan and is not worth listenning to. For any prospective buyers...: BUY IT!!!!!!!! The greatest riffs and the best mosh-pitt provokers are all here. Don't worry, it's not just mindless heavy-metal, but rather the greatest contribution from the most talented band in the world!!!!! Best Tracks: 1) ENTER SANDMAN (you won't be able to stay still!) 2) THE UNFORGIVEN ( Great intro!)"
2,Let Down,"I was not impressed with this disc at all. The 5.1 multichannel is mostly up front,nothing major happening in the rears for any great length of time.The drums have been kicked way up and I find it to be distracting to the rest of the music.Enter Sandman could have been done so much better.Here are Audio DVD's I recommend as being much better.Fleetwood Mac - Rumours,America - Homecoming,Foreigner - Foreigner,Queen - A Night At The OperaDoobie Brothers - Captain & MeSave your money on Mettalica."
3,Cheeztallica: The Beginning of the End,"Before you flame me, the three stars in in comparison to what they had released up 'till then. Gone was the complexity and intelligence of Master and Justice...instead we get monochromatic, watered down rockers, ballads and foreshadowing the travesty of S&M; a few years later-STRINGS for crissakes (made me think of Jon [Deep Purple]Lord's horror--The Concerto for Group and Orchestra).OK, I'm NOT asking that they should have kept repeating themselves like so many other bands have/do. I just feel it was a backward step artistically (I'm glad they were able to make a bunch of money BTW, I just wish that they would release something INTERSTING again.)"
3,uh-huh...yeah,"I'll say it once again: The black album by metallica is good, and definitely worth buying, but it isn't the messianic godsend to heavy metal everyone makes it out to be. It did not influence Grunge music and groups like Nirvana, Alice in Chains etc. (How could it influence them? It came out at the same time!!). The only thing it firmly stated is that Metallica was changing from excellent thrash music to a slower, doomier sound and eventually to blues-based alternirock. I listen to and play A LOT of metal, and firmly state that bands such as Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and Cream had that original ""grunge"" sound that would later influence alternative bands in the early nineties. All the black album did was give metallica their last mega-album before their glory years would end in '96 with LOAD. Buy it as a good album, but..."
4,Still Metallica,"While this album is softer than previous recordings, it is still Metallica. It isn't as fast as the other recordings, but it still has that sound that makes you a little crazy. I give it 4 - and that's only because it didn't have the loudness of the previous albums."
3,"Not their best, just ok","This album was the beginning of the end for this band, and their credibility as a sincere band. Now they are main stream to the max, and METALlica should be POPlica. They used to be the opposite of commercial, but now they are your Sell Out Icon. Don't get me wrong, commercial music can be good, but now they like to make a ton of money and complain because they can't squeeze any more out because Napster. Seems like they forgot who/what they are."
5,Great CD,"From the first guitar solo from ""Enter Sandman"" to the final note of ""The Struggle Within"" this CD is worth it's 15 bucks."
4,A decent album from the band,"Well the black album wasn't that bad of an album from metallica. For some people they say that this isn't the old metallica but some elements of the old metallica are still in here. It's not their heaviest album but it still has some good tunes. My friend of Misery is a song that is pretty good. Even Sad But True is another song that I can say is pretty heavy from the album. This is the album that put metallica into the mainstream and for some they soldout. But hey what band in music today hasn't sold out. Eventually your favorite band will and for Metallica, many fans just couldn't accept that.To me they didn't. I just think they just tried to do some diffrent stuff and explore more of their creative musical abilities. It's very diffrent from their previous work. But if your starting to become a Metallica fan I suggest starting off with this album and then hear the heavier stuff."
5,good ol' Metallica,"I really like this album. To me, it has the elements that make Metallica great: killer riffs, powerful Hetfield vocals, and intelligent lyrics. My one small problem with ""the black album"" is that quite often many of the songs on it get played to death on the radio(Enter Sandman, Sad But True, The Unforgiven, Nothing Else Matters) so it is not hard to get sick of them. All in all, though, it is something worth checking out if you have an open mind to different styles of rock and metal."
2,This is more of a rock album than metal,"Trashers out there would abhore this slomp effort of Metallica. And I, for myself, would prefer Megadeth--for having release the incomparable ""Rust In Peace"" a year earlier. This album is not trash metal that's for sure. There are good songs here. Classics as some might even claim...but just buried beneath frustrated expectations. For starters, stick with the first four essential Metallica albums."
3,Are you kidding me,I waited almost three years for this album to come out. I waited drooling and dreaming of what could they do to make a better album than ...And Justice. The day came. I bought Black and raced out to my car jammed it in the CD player and cried. My favorite band was gone and they put imposters in thier place. Outside of four songs this album is a debacle. In short Bob Rock ruined the best heavy metal band ever. Other reviewers said the lyrics are better on Black than ...And Justice. They clearly haven't listened to Justice. ...And Justice is complex and wicked music inwhich the lyrics are carefully intwined. I'm still waiting for Metallica to make a better album than ..And Justice. St. Anger is a step in the right direction.
3,Dumbed down for the masses,"Although there are some great tracks on this album (Wherever I May Roam, Nothing Else Matters) the truth is that majority of the tracks feature very basic guitar riffs, cliche tempo changes and unintriguing drumming. The album on a whole is less than impressive.If you like mainstream music which is dumbed down for the masses, I recommend this album.However, if you appreciate music which is heavy yet beautiful, powerful yet artistic, I recommend you listen to Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets instead of this."
3,Buy Puppets or Lightning instead,"Ok, if your a yuppie and want to buy this album for Enter Sandman and Nothing Else Matters, then go ahead, make MetallicA Richer. But Those two hits aside, this album is solid, if not average, there are some good songs, two or three excellent songs, and A Couple of Fillers. MetallicA made a radio freindly album, it sold a quizillion copies, and they went on to release the worst pile of tripe ever. This is the last time metallica would play reasonable metal..Blah, By Master of Puppets instead."
2,"Not ""The best album ever"".","This is where Metallica went commercial. It's not the best, but not the worst. This album gets 2 1/2 stars.I liked half of it. It was a big change, but in some case it was a good change. I did like Nothing Else Matters and I would dare say it was one of their best songs.I prefer the old school Metallica and I still laugh when people say this ""was the first Metallica album"". It holds no candle to Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, & And Justice for All.I even prefer Kill them All over the Black album. Anestasia-Pulling Teeth. Need I say more??I will say that it's no worse than Load, Reload, and St. Anger. I still scratch my head wondering what the hell happened when they put those three albums out. I guess they're still making layaway payments for their chin peircings, black fingernail polish and mascara."
2,Not bad but......this is the start of them selling out.,"THIS COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER, I THINK THAT THE SONGS SEEMED HURRIED. LYRICALLY ITS NOT BAD, BUT THE MUSIC OVERALL ON THE CD IS NOT AS GOOD AS WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN."
2,"Their worst album, but still alright","Its their worst album because the transition between old and new is just offputting. Its like the album is caught in a one dimensional time warp, its not consistent, its just not that good. Lars has seemed to forget how to play drums on this one and although theres some good powerful riffs on it, only a handful of songs really stand out. Enter Sandman, probably the simplest song on the album (nice wah wah textures tho in the solo) is so over-played and over-rated its just not funny and Dont Tread On Me, geez, they seemed to just chug a few power chords together and put to tape whatever they came up with, and the solo, Hammetts worst solo on any Metallica album. However shining lights include My Friend Of Misery and Wherever I May Roam.Too many people own this one, MOP and Ride deserved all the accolades and sales, this did not.Still, its Metallica, and they're the definitive metal band."
5,Heavy yet Harmonious,"Well, what can I say. Vast improvement in the band in general between ......And Justice for all and this album. The songsmithing on all songs reaches out to a wider audience than previous albums so should appeal to all tastes, not just us metalheaded moshers! Personal Highpoints, all of Sad but True and the prayer in the middle of Enter Sandman. All in all an album you can safely play your Mother that never the less kicks A$$!"
1,Truly Awful!,"It's astounding how bad this is. Contains possibly the worst song ever, NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. People love to rip on hair bands and their power ballads, but this song is an amazing low point in recorded music history.These guys are millionaire rock stars, I don't get why they seem so mad at everything."
1,Oh please!,You all know this is a fly-by-night band. They have nothing memorable to show. They'll be gone tomorrow.
2,The turning point,"This album marked the sad point when Metallica discarded the incredibly cultivated, dynamic sound they had nurtured for most of the 80's and simply became another sellout band. The songs on this album lack the classical influences of their prior 3 albums, as well as all the emotional involvement of those albums. Hopefully they'll come to their senses eventually."
1,THIS IS NOT METALLICA!,"What the hell is this? This isn't Metallica. Every song is just slow, boring, radio-friendly rock. ""Nothing Else Matters"" sounds like something hair metal band like Bon Jovi would do. Metallica sold out on this one, stick to their first four albums.AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS."
2,Beginning of the End,"This started the downfall for Metallica, one of my favorite bands until this piece of donkey-hair came out.The songs were so overplayed you didn't need to buy the album (and I played it several times myself, gotta point the finger at me too).This was the beginning where they really softened up, yet embraced the media like a crack addict. With touring for 3 years straight, pushing videos, documentaries, live albums, performances on Arsenio Hall, MTV, Metallica made enough money that they should have retired.Load&Reloadwere better, andGarage, Inc.beat all three, but I gave this one 2 stars because it was at least better than their newest piece of garbageSt. $#!T."
3,A puzzle,"Those of us who grew up on the 'real' Metallica sound were thrown by this one. No thrash or speed or tempo craziness or any other thing that was a Metallica trademark up to this point is to be found here. Still, as much as we wanted to hate this album, we all bought it, and even liked it. It spawned top-40 hits, which we early fans weren't used to. Non-metal types were at the concerts, which we early fans weren't used to. This one took a lot of getting used to. Our biggest fear was that Metallica would completely abandon their 'old' sound, and unfortunately this happened. No more Lightning, no more Kill 'Em All, and tragically, no more Puppets. Yea, you heard me Lars, I said PUPPETS!"
2,The record that sent them Spiraling downward,"Wow, what can I say about this album that hasn't already been said? Let's start with the obvious: THIS ISN'T THRASH!!!! What were they thinking? The technicality is still kind of there on this album, but the raw speed which made their first four records so good is almost entirely missing. There are some tempo shifts, but there is not the progressive 'feel' of '...And Justice for All' or 'Master of Puppets'. Next, we have Hetfield's vocals. They're decent, but he doesn't have the rebellious, rip-your-soul-out style any more, going more for the mainstream sound. Overall, this is an OK album if you like the post-1991 era Metallica. But, if you are a thrash maniac like me, DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
1,This sucks!,"I bought this cd because of all the hype surrounding Metallica but I guess everyone has really bad taste because ""Metallica just sucks!"" There's nothing special about these guys. The music was so slow and plain sounding. I think thrash fans should try out the real thrash gods Megadeth."
2,The begining of the downward spiral,"Like I stated in my title, this is where everything went wrong with Metallica. The geniuses we knew and loved for ""Master of Puppets"" sold out, with simplier song structures, stereotypical metal lyrics, and no real drive anymore. If only Cliff didn't die, they would be in much, much better shape. It's a shame when a band that used to be so monumentally great and talented could sell out to become just another cheap rock band. And the problem is, it just got worse and worse from here on, the latest ""Metallica"" release being the ambyssal ""St. Anger"". About two decent songs are included on this album (""Enter Sandman"" and ""Wherever I May Roam""), and a bunch of lame ones. They really lost it with this album."
1,Begining of the end,"I cant believe this CD gets the kind of reviews it does because it does not deserve them.I am proud to say this is the last Metallica Albumn I Ever bought.Metallica use to be a great metal band...now they are MTv's best friend,it's sad But true."
3,cute!,"very cute.. I love kitties :) however.. caused a lot of dust in my car, so I took it out after a month or so."
4,Angel Statue,"I was somewhat disappointed in that the picture shows the angel sitting on a stone or ledge. However, this stone or ledge is not included with the statue so I will have to find some place to sit her where she can be balanced and not keep falling over. It probably mentioned this in the description but I did not notice it. I went solely by the picture.Otherwise the statue is very cute."
5,"Value for Money DVD,s","Another very good Noir collection,though maybe not as good as Vol 1 but fans should not be disappointed.""Crossfire""on its own is worth the purchase. The DVD quality of each transfer is excellent and never mind the other reviews about lack of features etc,what the heck,a few bucks for 5 movies?,a snip!.Anyhow roll on Vol 3"
3,Less Wild about this Set,"I agree with the reviewer above who wasn't wild about this set and would have preferred to see more new, previously unavailable releases in this package. By the way, Dillinger is not a noir film and does not belong in this set; it belongs in Warner's Gangster Collection (C'mon guys, quit trying to blur the genre distinction, who do you think is buying this old B&W; stuff? Kids? Your cinephile customers know...)With studio film libraries being brought, sold and passed around like soda cans, who can say where and to whom RKO's ""They Live By Night"" belongs to now, but that's the sort of title we'd really like to see in the Noir series. Next box, make our eyes pop like you did with the first box"
2,Disappointed in choices on Vol. 2,"While there are several quality ""Noirs"" on this collection,they could have served us better by getting out some titles that are harder to find.I never particularly cared for ""Clash by Night"" and like ""Crossfire"",Narrow Margin"",and ""Born to Kill"" these titles were always easy to locate on VHS. Only the semi-noir gangster genre ""Dillinger' was a bit difficult to find.I was hoping to see previously un-released ,hard to find classics,like,particularly ,""Wilder's ""The Big Carnival"",""Thieves Highway"",""Angel Face"",""Where Danger Lives"",""Ride the Pink Horse"",""Fallen Angel"",Nightmare Alley"" [I see this has been issued as a single],""The Reckless Moment"",""The Night Has a 1000 Eyes"",and others of the important,but uncommon ""Films Noirs"".When you wait a year for these collections you want more than the very good but common ""Narrow Margin"" !!!Jim B. Cleve."
3,It was really good.,"I really enjoyed the idea, and concepts that she offered in the book. Some of the dialog is typical, and common. But the story itself is really nicely done. Good reading for a rainy Saturday afternoon."
1,picture and product not the same,Not what I expected I guess it read my fault did not read what size of turkey or it was made for chicken not turkey.
2,Capacity Issues,"Great size for boiling 5-10 pounds of crawfish or frying wings, but if you plan to have a large boil, don't go with this product. It will take 5+ boils to go through a 40 pound sack of crawfish and that's not counting the potatoes and corn.I have a 10 quart stove top pot with basket and it almost has the same capacity as this one. I expected a much larger basket. They could have easily added depth and width to it without effecting the boil. Very disappointed."
4,Bayou Steamer,"Order arrived in a timely manner....good price...used it for the first time last weekend, and it was great not having to ""dig"" out the cooked items."
5,fry it up,"So far i have used this for chicken wings, breasts, thighs, legs, potato's they all came out great..i have found out not to use egg when frying chicken butter milk is less sticky and wont stick to the...B300 btw peanut oil is the way to go"
4,"Not perfect, but sturdy","This basket does fit the Master Chef turkey fryer that we have, but it is not suitable for steaming as stated, as it doesn't come with a way to keep it from sitting on the bottom of the fryer, which you don't want when steaming. Since we were planning to cook crab legs, we were disappointed at first. However, we figured out a way to use large bolts as legs for the steamer basket, and then it worked perfectly. It should be advertised correctly. Other than that, it is a sturdy basket. As I ordered it through Prime, it came very quickly and in good condition."
1,not what i ordered,"I am very disappointed with the Bayou Classic B300 Accessory basket shipped to me. I ordered this basket because in the Product Dimensions it stated it was : 11 x 11 x 14 inches ; 3.3 pounds . The basket I received is a Bayou Classic B300 but the dimensions are 11.5""w x 12""h basket. I specifically order this basket because of the height being 14inches."
5,Fry Basket,This fry basket is great. It exactly fit the pot that I purchased it for. It is good quality for the price.
2,Not what I expected,The construction of the basket is fine but it was not what I expected. I wanted to fry fish in this basket and it really wasnt suited for that purpose.
3,"Love the shoe, but","Order a size or even a half size smaller than you normally wear. Bought these in a 9, but was swimming in them. Very pretty shoe, but useless for me unless my feet grow some."
2,spider box,"The spider on the spring was not glued on when i opened it. But what can you expect for $1.50. Maybe a 5 year old would think its funny, thats about it. Very cheap!!!!! Sorry Magic Mirror"
2,"Doesn't Really ""Jump Out""","From the title of this product, I thought it would jump out like the snake in the can of nuts gag toy, but it doesn't. The spider is on top of a spring and wobbles back and forth once the lid is opened.Cute toy, but I wouldn't purchase another one, nor recommend this one as a gag gift."
1,Spring not Jump,"Don't expect the spider to jump out at you or some unexpectent person. The spider is attached to a flimsy spring and your lucky if comes out 1 1/2. The spring was bent from being in the compact so when you opened it slowly springs to the side. If they define this as ""Jump"" then I get to call it something else... ""The Run Away Spider Compact"". Run Away before you waste your money."
5,Amazing Artist,I just love this artist. I had the privilege to see her live once and I would love to see her again. She has a lot of new material since then and I wish the big time for her and the band. Oh yeah and the supplier did a great job getting this to me in one piece.
4,Large Holdfast that works,"The holdfast works well I have to assist to get it to grip sometimes, but it does hold"
5,Demon-Powered Dinos,"Remember Buffy's battle with the Mayor a' la Snake? She had all of Sunnydale High and a lot of dynamite to back her up. This time the action pits the Buffinator against all the muscle of T-Rexes, and all the craftiness of a conniving demon. And this time, Buffy's more on her own. This is not to say the Scoobies, especially much-missed Oz aren't players, but the action here is top-notch. Yet what makes this book really roar are the original plot and character development. This isn't just a make-a-buck story plugged into an episode outline. The author has really developed the new characters while incorporating our standard faves, and she knows how to make rising action carry a plot. A must-read for die-hard Buffy fans, those just arriving at Sunnydale, and everyone looking for a novel this Halloween season."
2,A Disappointing Read,"I've read a good chunk of the Buffy novels that are out there, and I have to say, this one was disappointing. It seemed that the author did not have a firm enough grasp on the Buffy-verse characters to write them with the truth or reverence that true fans have come to expect from these novels. The aw-shucks, dino-rific! focus was more appropriate for younger Buffy readers/watchers, while the gore factor was unnecessarily high. If you're dying for a Buffy fix, this'll do, but I'd recommend rereading your Watcher's Guide, or picking up something by the always satisfying Christoper Golden and Nancy Holder."
3,Buffy Meets Jurassic Park,"In this book, Buffy must stop a quartet of re-animated dinosaurs from releasing a dangerous demon into the world. The storyline was good, and the book itself well-written, but it didn't feel much like a Buffy book. Buffy and Oz were used fairly well, but the rest of the Scooby Gang (including Giles) were pretty much window dressing. The sub-plot about Oz's band was interesting, but it needed to be developed further. The author seemed very comfortable with the plot and the original characters (Kevin and Daniel), but not so comfortable writing for the series' charactes. If you like dinosaurs and such, it's a good read, but if your main interest is in reading about Buffy and her friends, you may well be disappointed."
4,Dinosaurs and Demons spell Dynamite,"A clever pairing of dinosaurs and a mythical demon makes this Buffy novel unique. The first half of the book sets up the science. The last half explodes with action. Oz fans will be pleased that he takes a leading role in this story. Set in the scoobies' senior year Angel's expertise and strength is called upon through out. A warning,however, to Buffy and Angel fans there is no romance just breath taking chases and battles. Ms Navarro mixes humor with the havoc. Angel and Xander bicker. Particular interesting is the descriptions of Buffy and the scoobie gang by a new Sunnydale senior. The sub plot which concerns a manager for the Dingos Ate My Baby fits in neatly. A well written adventure. I recommend this book"
3,Super Reader,"Two self-centred paleontology students cause problems after they put to work a theory and spell found in a 1939 researcher's notes. They bring back a dragon demon via the resurrection of some dinosaur eggs.The eggs that they thought were Timimus actually were something more like Rex, and they grow fast, and the demon needs four of them. Four Rexes, even baby ones, can eat a lot of people. With a demon controller, even worse."
2,don't bother,i read this book and the basic story was very good. it dealt with 2 young men who find a way to bring dinosaurs back to life. the story there was pretty good until you remember that this is supposed to be a story about buffy the vampire slayer. the author does not seem to remember that until the end where the slayer and slayerettes get thrown in more as an after thought at the end. i would have given the book a better rating if they had interacted more in the story.
1,Bronto Buffy,"There are some places no Slayer should ever go. Jurassic Park is one of them. Of all the Buffy books, this is the weakest by far. Aside from the odd juxtaposition of Buffy and dinosaurs, the book just plods along like a brontosaurus, itself."
2,Unless you have nothing better to do . . . .,". . . . I'd say you should read this book. Nothing really outstanding. It's set -as most of the Buffy books from the past two years- in that alternate season three universe created by Golden and Holder where Faith and Wesley seem to not exist and Giles was never fired by the Council. But the story has more problems than that. The author seems to hide her tentative grasp of the Buffy characters by dedicating most of the first half of the book to two original characters that most Buffy-fans would not really care about to begin with, and then throwing in a lot of action in the second half so Buffy and the gang are too busy running around to have time to interact with each other in a way we are familiar with, which is good because most of the scenes when they do don't ring true and the dialogue, more often than not, doesn't sound like them either. ...it's about time they took the Buffy novels out of season 3..."
1,poop,"horrible.doesn't even show the editor, so it can't be used as a rightful source to anything you made need to do with it.and it's horribly outdated as well."
1,Disappointing and unreliable,"Purchased this MP3 player because it utilizes MusicMatch (which I use) and has a 1.5 g hard drive.- instructions provided are vague and terrible- impossible to get tech support- sounds awesome (when it works)- great carrying case- built in battery is nice- easy to transfer music (once you figure it out)- no FM tuner- I've returned 2 within the past month (hard drive crashed and couldn't be reset)The first failure I attributed to a fluke but the same thing happened to the second one. Couldn't be reset. Received a full refund. Can anyone recommend an MP3 that has a decent sized hard drive, reliable, MusicMatch software and a proper carrying case for working out?"
1,Died after 4 months!!!,"Steer clear of this one. I bought mine new off of eBay (I think I got for around $125 including shipping and insurance) and it died about four months later. Unfortuantely, I blew off submitting the warranty paperwork so I don't have recourse with RCA. Plus, I can't find a place to service it locally-- even though RCA's lame website said there was an electronics repair place that could service it. That shop said they don't work on mp3 player. Even if they were capable, it'd probably be more cost effective just to buy an new one.I think i'm going to go for the more expensive but more reliable ?? Ipod or similarly highly ranked hard-disk based player."
1,Bunk!,It would change modes while transfering and creat an error. After a system restore it is possible music files changed and would not play and froz MP3 Player. After battery drain it worked but computer would not connect to it. Check on two other computers at parents house and same thing. Right on time before warranty. Lucky!
2,Good while it lasted...but it was a short honeymoon,"It worked at first, software was easy enough to use, and the size was great. After about a year it would no longer play nicely with my PC -- I couldn't add or remove any music. I called RCA tech support and told them I had already tried uninstalling/reinstalling the latest software and they said, ""Well, you've already done all of the tech support yourself. You have passed the 1-year warranty, thank you, <click>"". What a load of garbage. Uninstall/reinstall is the extent of their ideas?? No more RCA products for me."
5,ideal physical size and storage,"Before settling for this, tried two others, but ever since got this, it has just stayed with me. I can easily tuck it into any pocket, file transfer is trivial, it feels light yet not cheap piece of plastic/metal. Bettery life is excellent, sound quality is good and the buttons are well laid out. The only problem was making playlists which I have yet to figure out!"
1,High hopes fall FLAT!,"Received this as a gift.DOESN'T WORK AT ALL WITH MY MAC OS X 10.3It knows it's there but is unwritable and won't mount. If I unplug it and turn it on, it turns off after a few seconds and it's fully charged.Do yourself a favor, buy an iPod!"
5,Perfect companion for my iPOD!,"Love my iPOD. Wouldn't trade it for the world. The iPOD is my ""RV"", the RCA Lyra is my ""Bike"". This thing is so tiny, it's amazing. I use it every morning with my run, my iPOD is a wee bit big for my run. I take the RCA, tuck it in the waistband of my jogging shorts and run till i can't run anymore, and still have plenty of songs to get me back home. Completely easy to use, on a Mac that is. Tried it on my pc, the software was confusing and strange. But on my mac, i plugged in the unit with the supplied usb cord, the RCA icon appeared on my desktop, opened iTunes, and just drug the songs i wanted onto the white RCA icon on my desktop. That easy.i was worried about the ""ok for mac"" on the description, but like just about everything else, it was far easier on a Mac.Buy it, enjoy it. It's great if you don't need a lot of music at one time."
2,Not Flash Based!,"Just a word of caution- this device does not have flash-based memory, but rather a micro hard drive. Think of it more as a small-capacity Ipod."
3,heavy and harder than perceived,The torpedo is great to zoom through the water but it unfortunately is composed of very hard plastic. It might break if thrown out of the pool and lands on the pool deck. If it were made of rubber instead of plastic it would be a much better toy and would be awarded five stars and not three.
4,trouble free,This cassette player works well. I would have liked to know that there was no electric cord with the player. I had one that was compatible so it was not a big problem. The player was a gift for an elderly woman who is blind and owns a lot of books on tape that she was unable to enjoy until we found this player. Glad to find it-- and it arrived in a timely manner.
1,No voices...,"I didn't record any voices from the other side with this.. therefore, it is of no use to me."
3,Tough to beat for $...,"My brother has one of these, which I'm using now. It gets the job done with no frills. I can't speak about the internal mic, as he bought an external one from Radio Shack also. It is true that this is smaller than other shoebox recorders. It runs from DC power only, which explains the plug-in transformer which must be used. Personally, I'd rather have a regular AC cord in with the power supply built into the recorder. That design doesn't hog so much room on power strips. If you're buying the shoebox style, you're probably not all that concerned with the size. What you want in the shoebox style is a desktop-friendly design, right? Well to me this isn't it. For one thing, when pressing the buttons, you have to hold the rear end of the recorder down since the buttons are so stiff. Anyway, the thing doesn't reek of quality, but for $..., it's not bad at all."
1,Sound is horrid...even with external mic,"I never learn...pay more for better quality...I bought the GE recorder and as others have said, the sound is horrible, muffled and hissing. So I paid $10 more for an external mic, with very little improvement.So I bought the Sony recorder, for only $5 more than the GE!, and the sound is immensely better. And the built-in mic on the Sony is even better than with an external mic.Avoid the GE...pay only $5 more and get the Sony, which has automatic shutoff and a carrying handle, both which the GE doesn't."
2,Not good enough,"I bought this unit because the Sony unit was not in stock, other reviews indicated that it was slightly smaler than a standard shoebox recorder which for me is good. I always use batteries so the wall-wart style AC adaptor was not an issue for me.Unfortunatly the unit has issues.First the unit uses AA batteries instead of C cells. This makes it smaller, but C cells last a LOT longer than AA's. Also the internal mic is awfull, lots of tape noise. All recorders will have some tape noise but this is really bad. I never had that problem with my trusty old Radio Shack Model.In order to get any utility out of this I will have to pick up an external mic, which brings the total up past $30. If I had wanted to spend that much I could have just gone to Radio Shack."
2,I liked it when it worked.,"This recorder at first was pretty good for the price, but the plug for the AC adaptor shorted, so I had to throw it out. I probably had it for a little over a year and did not use it frequently. I did not drop or misuse it. I'm going to try the Panasonic next."
2,Have not tried it for recording yet.. but playback rocks,"I am finishing my dissertation.. and I recorded interviews with a handheld and I have been using this tape player from a friend.. and for playback it rocks. i was using a transcriber with footpedal and I never thought I would use a tape player. but the shoebox design makes it okay but more importantly I can hear so much more on this tape player than I could on the transcribers. For transcribing it does have a pretty big backspace (ie.. when I hit return for a second, it really rewinds)but I think it has great sound. My only advice - don't do interviews at Starbucks! :)"
1,some songs too mature for young people; Buy with caution,"Some of these songs contain veiled sexual references that I don't appreciate my 10 year old being exposed to. I protect my children from being sexualized, and this disc does not allow me to do that. To hear my 10 year old asking about the girl in the Whitesnake video and snakeskin miniskirt is not the conversation I expected to have after listening to a Disney Karoke disc. Given some of the movies, I should have known better. Buy with caution."
4,Worked pretty well...,Used this dye to stain a drum shell that I had pulled the wrap off of. Took two coats and looks great with a polyurethane finish. Definitely would recommend this to someone restoring musical instruments made of wood.
4,"Half of the Stories, I believe",I believe the <14 hours of recording only covers the first half of the book. I'm wondering if audio for the second half exists?
1,OK essays but:,"As pep talks and education for beginning artists, I think the demeanor has a feeling of anger and singular religiousity. Most of the ideas presented have been written about or alluded to numerous times in art criticism; nothing wrong with re-itterating them, but the tone is what bothered me. I prefer to not work from a position of anger and rightousness. Although it is difficult to do. In the Umberto Eco interview, Paris Review #185,he talked about two kinds of art he didn't like; that which is better than his and he wish he had done it, and that which is worse than his.Based on Ms. Winterson's writing, I doubt if she is a very fun person to be around (just guessing for what it's worth, but she only wants to be judged by her work, sorry)."
1,Oh. Dear.,"A really quite awful book from a once-quite good author (witness 'Oranges are not the Only Fruit', an inspiring and insightful novel later turned into an equally good television programme). Layers of pretentious prose tumble over each other whilst blindingly fatuous 'points' are made with all the subtlety of, well, any of Jeanette Winterson's other, later works. As Emerson, Lake and Palmer once found out, basing a work around an epic subject does not make the work epic. It merely throws the paucity of ideas into relief."
1,"i still not receive this item, i have wait for a month already!!","i still not receive this item, i have wait for a month already!!"
3,Nice full size cam,I have owned this cam for a year now. I have never had any problems with it. It uses normal vhs tapes so they will play directly on your vcr. The zoom is not the strongest around but it gets the job done. This is a nice full sized cam at a nice price.
1,Be Careful What You Buy Here!,"I ordered this camera, and paid for it. When the camera arrived; it did not work. I now find that I have no recourse at all. I am out all my money for a camcorder that is useless. So, be careful what you buy on this web site. I will never be here again.Note: the one star rating is because there is no ""0"" star rating."
2,CD Player Skips,"The CD player on this clock radio skipped the very first time I tried to use it. I tried different CDs, I tried making certain it was on a very stable surface but it still skipped: about once every minute or so. I'm sending it back this week."
1,Cheap buy,"I recently recieved this product as a gift and was very pleased with its original performance. However, within a week the cd player began to not work, saying that there was no disc loaded. I thought maybe it was just the disc so i tried other ones, none of them worked. I then tried playing the discs in another cd player and they all worked fine. I then decided maybe it was just a flaw in this particular player so i went and exchanged it for a new player. This new player then did the exact same thing to me when i brought it home, however this time it never worked. I would strongly discourage other customers from buying this product. The features are great on the player/alarm clock and I hope that RCA fixes the above described problem soon."
2,Very Poor Quality CD Player,Within 1 month the CD Player was no longer able to recognize CDs (even brand new ones)
2,Another non-functional CD player,"As with other reviewers for this product, the CD player on my unit failed within the first 24 hours. It worked fine when I took it out of the box, but an hour later it didn't. I tried different CDs...tried checking switches to make sure that I wasn't the problem....no luck. Since I was specifically looking for a CD clock radio, that means this one doesn't fit the bill. From the sounds of other reviews on this product, there must be a real problem with these CD units."
2,"Oh Why, Oh Why Did The CD Die?","I had the same experience as Wichita Falls, TX. The unit looks great and worked well but after about a month the CD player just died. That was last year. Since I haven't replaced it yet (for my desk at work) I thought I'd try again. Hopefully the CD issue (if there is one) has because corrected and my replacement unit will work as well as it looks."
3,RCA RP3761 at Radio Shack,"I just bought a RCA RP3761 at Radio Shack in Atlanta, GA, USA.Two differences that I have noticed from the RP3751 are that the color is gray hued plastic instead of bronze and the LED has a light sensor for automatic dimming. The radio tuner display still is not lit and difficult or impossible to see in dim light.I hope that the reliability problems of the CD player that have been reported here have been addressed."
3,Someday...,"Yanni, in his first album Optimystique, 'created' a sound known the world over. Unfortunately, that sound was a blatant ripoff of the artist Styx. Yanni changes style from his prior albums in Niki Nana. The sound here is much more synth-orchestral - something Yanni and many other people thought had never been done before.Some of the reviewers here have been lauding the track ""Someday"" from this album. With a quick listen to Jean-Michel Jarre's Revolutions album, released a year before Niki Nana, one will find a song that is almost exactly the same as ""Someday"" entitled ""Computer Weekend"". Both tracks start off with a water crashing sound, then to an upbeat synth ballad with very similar rhythms. The sounds and rhythm work well for both artists, but I would be very surprised if Yanni didn't based the song off Jean-Michel Jarre's work."
5,In My Opinion,"Martin Sexton is one of a kind. I have really just been getting to know him and have enjoyed everything i've heard from him. Went to see him in pereson and have to put him up there with the top shows i've seen. This is his Christams disc, but all i've heard from him is pretty good."
4,Gets you in the Sprirt,"Martin Sexton's Camp Holiday is an album with all the traditional favorites, yet something is pleasantly different. His acoustic preformances calm down even the most stressed-out xmas shopper. I could picture reading by the fire, tree lit, mom cooking dinner...dog curled up on my lap. Basically all of the warmth one expects is in each song, but the next level is attained with Martin's insightful interpretations of each. My personal favorite is ""O Christmas Tree."" Sexton fans won't be disappointed, and first time listeners will become hooked."
4,"Nice product, good price","The necklace was very nice, better than it looked in the picture. It appears to be well made and has held up so far under extensive use! One complaint is that the box it came in was very disappointing and not suitable as a gift box."
2,Why does the description not point out that the keyboard won't slide out with this on?,"I was very disappointed to discover that my 8125's keyboard won't slide out with this cover in place. Not terribly useful, is it?"
3,Backpack for travel.,JanSport Driver 8 Core Series Wheeled DaypackI like to travel with a rolling backpack as my carry on. My old one had one wheel that was worn down and considerably smaller than the other and no longer rolled well. I purchased this backpack as a replacement. It is well made and the wheels are very durable. The problem is that it is too deep to fit under the airplane seat. I tried putting fewer things in it but everything shifted down and it was still too deep. It is definately too big for under the aisle seat. I was able to move contents around so that it did fit under the other seats. I'm perplexed what to do now. Do I try using a bungee cord or a strap around the outside to keep things from shifting or do I go back to using my old one that is not quite as big. It's a good backpack just not good for what I purchased it for.
4,Exactly what it says on the package,"Handle pulls up easily, lots of space inside, not too heavy if you want to wear it"
4,Two years now and counting....,"Bought this 2100 cc bag for my son's use as a bookbag in 6th grade based on previous reviews. It has been two years now and this bag is still going strong. It can take up a macbook pro, hardcover books, college sized notebooks, extra shirts/shorts and gatorade with no effect at all to the bag's integrity even with two years worth (and counting) of abuse. The wheels have been very sturdy even with all the weight and daily use over a cobblestone walkway. The wheels just won't break! It has also conveniently doubled as a luggage bag for hand carry by a child during plane rides. Really worth the money which is why I'm here to buy a brown colored version this time around."
3,"Good roller, not so good backpack","Had this backpack for a couple of days and, although it seems well-made and sturdy, rolls along fine, it's not really comfortable as a backpack. In addition, there is nothing to protect your back and sides from the wheels so transitioning from roller to backpack when the wheels are dirty (for example, when it's raining) will get your clothes dirty."
5,Great Bag,Bought this JanSport backpack for my daughter in her favorite color (purple) and she loves it. It fits all her 5th grade books and those big folders. The rolling handle is very sturdy. Will buy it again if we need to.
4,Great bag,"I have tried so many travel bags over the years from small to large but this light bag is excellent. Lots of usable space and tracks well, I put my 13"" Macbook Pro in a solid sleeve and packed it at the bottom not using the built in sleeve as it was too large. Haven't tried it as a backpack but will use it again on my next 8 flight week."
1,not what i expected,"good quality , easy to roll around... but no enough room hardly fit my stuff in it . looks big outside but not big inside"
5,great bag,This bag is so good. My brother used it for 4 yearrs and the trolley mechanism remained as new. I am now buying it again for him to use it for next years to come.
5,Great rollerbag,Really like this roller bag- well worth the money! It's light yet it carries all my nursing books I have to tote around. I ordered the black and it's classy. Has a lot of compartments and a water bottle holder on the side. Plus it'll make a great carry on bag when I fly some where!
4,Good item,"I bought for my 8-year son. He is in 3rd grade and needs to carry many books to and from school. This school bag is pretty good. It's enough big for his all stuff. The only bad thing is that there is only one side pocket. Generally, we need two. One for water bottle, the other for umbrella."
5,Awesome!,The quality of the backpack is outstanding. It's pretty with lots of pockets and very spacious inside. The wheels glide easily and the handle is easy to hold. Very good value for the money. Thanks Amazon!!
2,After 4 months it broke!?!?,"I was in the market for a new computer bag and I also needed a bag for school and work. My current bag was putting a major strain on my shoulders and I wanted to get a rolling bag that didn't look too business. When I first found the JanSport bag I was thrilled, it was sporty, had wheels, and looked well built. After 4 monthes of normal use, the retractable handle is BROKEN! I plan on writing a letter to the company to let them know of my disappointment with this product. Buyer beware!"
5,Great quality!,This bag is a bit on the expensive side but I figured I would get a good one the first time around. Lots of space inside it also stands up when loaded and unloaded. Another plus is that the wheels are quieter than most bags with wheels.
4,JanSport Wheelled Backpack,"Backpack is larger than thought - but it is great. Needed the larger size.Zippers seem cheap - but they have not snagged or broken - but we will see. Jansport is a good brand, so I am counting on that for the zippers."
2,Great Bag for the Month it Lasted,"We were really happy with this bag until the release button jammed on the handle just four weeks after we got it. The good news is that JanSport is honoring the warranty. The bad news is that the cost of shipping to their service center, which they refuse to cover, is quite high."
3,Saves my back,I read zillions of reviews online before getting this bag. The amazon price is the lowest of all vendors. I have been it using this for about 2 months now.Pros:Saves my backRolls smoothlyCons:all kinds of hair and gunk get stuck in the wheels from rolling it on streets.The bag is not spacious. The placement of the bar that is connected to the pull-along handle is in the center of the bag. It feels hard and also reduces the stuff that can be in the bag. I feel that my regular backpacks of comparable size hold more stuff.The computer pouch/sleeve is very tight and a 13 inch laptop sticks out on top.
5,excellent bag for under $80,"great bag for under $80...jansport is still the leader in backpacks and with the lifetime warranty, everybody is a winner...if only all other brands are confident enough to give customers this kind of warranty... ive been using jansport since 1990 and i still have my very 1st jansport...now it is my son's turn to enjoy the excellent quality of jansport...thanks jansport!"
1,Disappointed!!!,Ordered this bag after doing tons of research on rolling bags for my daughter to take to school. Was concerned about the price but I sucked it up......Less then 4 weeks after the bag is separating at the back from the wheel section. This is extremely disappointing!!! Poor construction!!
4,very efficient,"this bag is really efficient, seems strong, wheels are working perfectly even in rough surfaces.only improvement would be the inner separations, maybe more separations for your books and the laptop cables and stuff."
1,Very disappointed,I bought this bag for nursing school thinking that i would be a good quality because it was a Jansport. It starting tearing on the seam and now has a whole within a month of me using it.. For that price i am very disappointed and will not be purchasing anything again.
5,Great bag,I've had the bag a month now and so far so good. It has plenty of internal space and appears to be well made and sturdy. Zippers are good quality and so is the pull up handle. It has plently of pockets and overall I'm really pleased with this purchase. The bag was delivered on time and packaged well. I would recommend.
1,"The Company, Light Impressions, is very poor","Please do an online search about this company, Light Impressions, and you will discover that they have a reputation for not fullfilling their orders. Some people get partial orders and some have waited over a year and still haven't recieved anything. It is impossible to get a human being to answer the phone there. Their customer service does not excist! Avoid them."
2,Mediocre at best,"Yes, I know Harry Goz died a bit into this season, but that's no excuse for some of the low quality jokes in the later episodes. Especially the first one with Shanks. Seasons one and two of the DVD's had some high quality commentary, while the only decent commentary on this set is the first episode with Shanks whereas they let a third party completely rip the episode, and the third season of the series, apart, literally saying ""If you bought this I feel bad for you"" I swear, its in the commentary and its very true. Season 3 just was not at all entertaining after Murphy died. The best episode of the set is one in the special features that never aired... Overall, I am strongly disappointed. I only gave it a 2 rather than 1 because Harry Goz diserves better."
1,lacking hary goz(captain murphi's voice),"i sorely miss captain murphi, he is replaced by an annoying football coach type, compared to captain murphi's normal almost doctorial looks with utter craziness going on in his brain and coming out of his mouth, this new captain is a totally obvious idiot he looks and sounds and talks the way you'd expect him to. there's no craziness wrapped in a serious look, like murphi had. he has a southern accent too. which i found very sucky. i believe this(sea lab 2021) captain murphi was the original captian from the original serious cartoon drama from the late 1970's? or 80's? (sea lab 2020), same face, same voice actor(harry goz)... this new captian.... well.... just inst murphi. the other characters are always enjoyable though. but the great murphi mixture is gone. the original cadence is gone. and i watch season 3 strictly in case of emergency of overdose of seasons 1 and 2."
3,The beginning of the end,"After the death of Harry Goz, this show really suffered. Captain Murphy was EASILY the funniest aspect of this show. Shanks can't hold a candle to Murph. And the supporting cast was just there to be victimized by Murphy. This show should have been canceled after Harry Goz died."
3,Has it's moments.,"If you are a fan like me, you'll want it to complete the collection and because it has Harry Goz's Last episodes. It definately has its moments and ""Stormy Waters: Pundit"" is a fun extra. It may be unfortunately the least good season of the show but don't write the rest of the show off because season 4 is awesome!"
3,We'll miss you Harry G.,"Its remarkable how bad the show got after Harry (Capt. Murphy) died. There's a few episodes with him left on here which are always great. If I was king i would have not added any more characters and just made Quinn captain. Or heck maybe even Hesh! Would not have made sense but think of the potential. All the characters are great, except the new captain who I've heard is related to Harry in real life. I don't know his characters name because frankly nobody needed to. The show would have been light years better if they only maintained the original crew and pressed on from there. If for some tragic reason you are buying this DVD set before buy 1 or 2 then do yourself a favor and choke yourself...jk I mean go buy the first 2, watch them over and over for one month straight until you can quote each line and then move on to frisky dingo (ANOTHER MAJOR RECOMMENDATION)"
3,American Sermons,"I'm not really sure what attracted me to this book, perhaps it was an attempt to learn from influential theologians, perhaps it was a desire to learn from past religious periods. In any event, this book is not really all that spectacular. The sermons presented are lengthy and have no real mass appeal. Who selected them and why is never disclosed. They have no cohesiveness and seem randomly compiled. In other words, this book was a disappointment to me."
2,Dining Out Companion 2010,"I don't like this as much as the 2008 edition. It has less restaurants in it. Also, the points value are higher on some things, but it's the same plan, (flex plan), didn't get that either."
5,Excellent!!!,I could not put this book down. If you want to read a steamy novel with a little mystery and a wicked plot twist...this book is for you. I can hardly wait for the next book!!!
4,He/She's Mine!,"Having what some may consider a mid-life crisis, Rose, a forty-seven-year-old married mother of one, decides to go back to school. It isn't easy, but she welcomes the challenge.Her fellow classmate, thirty-five-year-old Derrick, is working on his masters in psychology. There's no denying the mutual attraction between the two. But remember, Derrick is single and Rose is not.As the two fight their attraction, circumstances change setting off a web of jealousy, deceit, love, insanity and even murder.Hands down, Darrin Lowery knows drama and he knows how to deliver a story saturated with it. Now this novel is one of his earlier works so it doesn't posses the finesse of his later works as his skills have sharpened, but it is worth reading. It arches over the top, but it'll pull fans along and not disappoint. The editing was horrible and it could have flowed a little smoother, but neither detracts from the solid plot. I'd love to see Darrin revisit this story and re-release it."
1,I just not feelin' it,"I just have to say that this book was WACK ON ALL LEVELS!!!! I do not know where the author got his degree from, but it seemed like maybe he picked it up at the local pawn shop somewhere. His english and grammar were nonexistant throughout the entire so called book. I wish I could give this book a -5 star rating."
1,IS IT ME?,"I thought this book was absolutely horrible. I am an avid reader and did not find this book in the least bit entertaining or realistic. There were character mix ups, several inconsistencies, and writing in repetitive form. Oh, and did I mention the poor editing? Several words were capitalized that should not have been and words that should have been were not. I don't think Mr. Lowery even proof read his book.I don't think it's necessary to ""self advertise"" in novels and find it a turn off. Unfortunately, Mr. Lowery did so several times which makes me not want to pick up another publication by this author. I was extremely disappointed with this novel."
2,Doesn't stick,"I had colorforms when I was little and I loved it. While the concept is the same, they must have changed the product, because it doesn't stick like it used to. My 3 year old really enjoyed playing with the toy, but would get very upset that the outfits would just fall off. I also was getting annoyed because I kept finding pieces all over my house. I ended up throwing the whole thing away."
4,Great for PreK health,"One of the things I cover with my children for homeschooling preK is health. One of the topics is taking care of yourself and within that topic, I talk to my girls about what clothes are appropriate given the weather.My older daughter is in kindergarten so she has lots of things to do. My 3 year old doesn't have many things that are ""hers"" to do. So, I bought this set used. It is one of her tasks to dress Miss Weather every day in the appropriate clothes. More often than not, she plays with all the few pieces and then when her attention is waning, I ask her to put the right clothes on her for the day. She enjoys having something that is ""hers"" to do.I don't stand the board up, so I haven't had any issues with the pieces not sticking and they are far more durable than paper dolls would be.I recommend this set for 3-4 year olds. I think it would be too young for children older than that."
2,The pieces don't stick!,"I echo many of the people reviewing this item in that the pieces DON'T stick. My two-and-a-half year old twins still like it and will play with it, but the pieces don't stick at all."
2,"Does not stick, not very durable","I bought this thinking it would be a travel toy for visits to Nana/Papa, etc. It doesn't work for that as it is 12"" x 12"" and so does not fit in any travel bag, and the colorforms do not stick at all. As a result, they fall out of the box pretty easily and you certainly can't play in the car. They also move around when bumped, so they don't stay put very well on the picture. After a few times of playing with this, the colors started to come off the stickers a bit, did not seem very durable.That said my 2 1/2 year old daughter enjoyed playing this, and it was good for talking about what to wear on different weather days. Lasted longer than the average sticker chart, but did not live up to my memory of colorforms."
2,"Child loves it, but pieces don't stick!","My child received this as a gift from her Grandmother. She had great fun with it, but unfortunately after the first week, the pieces no longer stick to the board. Now we have a million pieces all over the house, and we can no longer dress Miss Weather because her clothes and accessories fall right off! I would not purchase this again just because of that. I guess I'll throw it in the trash at this point."
2,colorform review,"It's nice,but would have liked a few more outfits, more colorforms for my granddaughter to play with in the set."
2,Does not stick,Great idea but does not stick and the small pieces are easy to lose. I tried cleaning the pieces per the directions but that did not solve the proplem. I'm very disspaointed.
2,Disappointing,"The Miss Weather colorforms are very colorful and the concept is ideal for younger children. The child picks the outfits to fit the season. Our problem was the decals would not stick from day one. Colorforms are supposed to stay on the board until removed. These would not even lay down. I really should have sent it back, but we made do for the one time she played it. I was very disappointed, my son had colorforms when he was young 15 years ago and they always stuck and stayed in place."
2,too bad for me,the plactic pieces do not stand their strength long enough so i had to buy another one at $11.00 . rip off.
2,Much too busy!,"This would have a good toy if it weren't for the dizzying amount of color. The actual board is so loaded with primary colors that it is hard to imagine a young mind getting a perspective on where to put the colorforms. A broader, cleaner white background would have improved this item a great deal. In this case, less would have been more."
1,good idea but pieces don't stick,"I bought this for my daughter even after reading all the other reviews that said t he pieces don't stick. I figures if they didn't stick well she could use it on the window. Within a day of getting it the pieces don't stick anymore. I even cleaned everything with water like they suggested but it didn't help. My daughter loves this toy but the pieces keep winding up all over the floor since they don't stay in place. She can't really use it on the window because the girl is not a piece so she can't dress anything up. The colorforms I had when I was little were great. These are terrible. Cute idea, but poor quality."
2,Doesn't stick at all.,"My two year old loves the idea of this toy - the clothes for different weather, the colors, the teddy bear - but is very quickly frustrated, as they don't stick at all. Not even fresh out of the box. So, every time she tries to add a new peice on, another one is so easily pushed out of place. I was very disappointed with this toy, and with the new colorforms."
3,Cute but they don't make things like they used to,"I love that the pieces are bigger so my 2 year old can pick them up with no problem, but after this is played with a few times, the pieces don't stick very well and the colors chip off of them. Not the same quality from years ago."
1,cool design - does not last,"I bought one of these at Target and really enjoyed it for about 4 months. The battery clip broke (cheap plastic, poor design) forcing me to tape the battery into it just to make it work. Now, target wont stand behind the product and it is inconvenient at best to use. Don't buy this product.."
4,What A Gem!!,I got this little gem about 2 weeks ago and I love it. It's compact and lightweight and downloading was a breeze on Windows Media player. I fit 65 songs in a matter of minutes. The only thing that I find a bit disappointing is that it doesn't have is a backlit it would come in handy since I like to listen to music at night. The armband is very useful during my workouts and I happen to find the volume level exceptional. One thing I would like to be able to do is download songs straight from napster onto my player so if anyone knows how to do that please let me know. I ideally wanted a ipod but I didn't really want to spend that kind of money so this is a great substitute and I highly recommend this item.
1,NOT FOR MAC USERS!!,"This product is a total lie. On the package it says it is compatible with Mac and PC. After having problems being able to play songs that I dragged to the player, I called technical support who informed me that they prefer that you use Windows and that they don't have any information to support Mac OS users. I explained that the reason the player was even bought was because it was compatible with Mac. The woman apologized and explained that they prefer you use Windows. The whole thing is extremely ludicrous and a complete lie. I will never buy another RCA product again. I am furious."
5,This is great,I just got my RCA LYRA 128 mp3 player. I find that the sound is absolutely amazing i could not beleive it when i heard it at the top volume. Set up was much easier than i thought with transferrs being resonably fast this is both on XP and 2000. I like the fact that it is so so so small!! I thought it would have been a little bigger. It is the perfect mp3 player for going to the gym. As a student it is so small that i can and will take it to the library with me. I dont like the ear phones they are too big for me but thats my only complaint. The arm band is also good abd i like the key lock function.
5,Great for running!,"I've been using it for 2 months, and am VERY pleased. The player installed flawlessly with my XP Professional systems, and the Music Match software works OK, but has some bugs. I'm using MusicMatch 7.5, the newer versions might be a little better, but haven't tried them. Some of the other critisims -- such as played songs out of sequence is due to the music match. The trick is create a playlist, save, send and then do not reorder the tracks, or the songs may play out of order.The only weak part of the unit is the headphones, but decent headphones cost $20. I like the Panasonic RP-HS40. I havent't use the SD cards much (I use them for my digital camer, and pocket PC) because I heard they suck up the battery. With the install 128MB memory I've been getting the full 15 hours.Use the MP3 Pro as opposed to the MP3 format. At 96kbps it sounds great!"
4,"I like it, crystal clear sound, but batteries are an issue","I just got one of these things at WALMART today because I was really fed up with all of the annoying plastic CDRs scattered all over the floor in my room. You don't even need to install the software that comes along with the player if you have a place to burn the music like windows media player..just plug it into the USB port and you're good to go. Now back to the battery issue. This player requires one AAA battery. Sounds good eh? Nice and lightweight. One prob. It only runs for eight hours of happy music playing time. I would just reccomend buying some GOOD quality rechargable batteries to save money in the long run. Trust me. You'll need em. If you're used to making cds and have a huge hard drive, i would reccomend making lots of playlists. That way you can erase songs from the player and put songs on easier when you need them. What I really like about this thing is it will burn FAST. Like 7 min for 30 songs. You'll like this gadget."
5,value for the price,"I am using and enjoying this mp3 everyday when going to the gym.it is a cool product for the price and the memory can be upgraded by memory card later, it lets you know what song is playing and you have alot of choices how you want your songs to be played. it is very light and comes with arm strap and i dont even feel I have it on durning workout. head phones are great too!"
3,great if you find a good deal for it-,"Hi, I got this Mp3 player for $10, yes ten dollars, from a kid at school that just wanted to get rid of it. The even better part is that he threw in a 256mb card- worth about $25 in with it. I have no clue how long he had it, or what he did with it, but when I first got it, it worked fine.About the unit itself, it was a medium size screen, and very simple controlls, (too simple if you ask me). Dont even try to live with the little 128 internal mb, that only fits about 25 songs max.this summer at camp, it was in my pocket while we were hiking, and the screen cracked, and since then some other problems have rissen, like the battery door comming loose, and a faint high pitched whine that you can hear when using it.I woulden't have bought this if it wasnt so cheap, and im looking at some other mp3 players now that have 512mb internal for around 75- its probably a bood buy for a kid who will probably end up breaking it after a while-thats my review"
1,Great idea with really bad quality,"I like the shape, the controls and the expansion slot. Too bad the production is so shoddy.The control buttons either stop working or start controlling the wrong commands. For example, I can control the volume from the song selection buttons, so now there is no way to skip to the next song. Hopefully next week it will switch back.The battery compartment top uses a 1/16"" plastic tongue to latch. And of course that broke, so now tape holds the battery in.And finally, once the battery life gets below 50%, a quick movement or change of volume turns the player off. Aggravating to say the least."
1,HIT OR MISS. I SAY DON'T TAKE THE CHANCE,"After reading other reviews it seems this product is either really good for some or really crappy for others. <br /><br />I got this for Christmas last year and it seemed ok as a gift. Windows found it right away and it was easy to put music on it as what should be expected.<br /><br />But I started to hate it because of the fact that I can't adjust the order of the songs unless I delete them and put them back on in the order I want them in.<br />The battery cover is flimsy and the whole thing is made out of cheap plastic. <br /><br />Now recently this thing stopped working all together on me. I put music on it but the thing freezes and says there are 00 songs on it.<br /><br />After looking at other reviews, I say don't take the chance of getting a crappy player."
4,instructions should be better,"Almost returned this mp3 player, I could not figure out how to transfer music from my hard drive, they were very skimpy and not very detailed on how to transfer music. (on the instructions)Tried to contact rca, useless! On the day I was going to return it, I gave it another try, but this time I used the help icon that music match jukebox provided, and it worked! Excellent mp3 player, good sound, lightweight and would have gave it a 5 star if the instructions were more precise. Buy one, you'll love it!"
1,"Very poor, not recommended","It sounded great and has great features, but manufacturing quality was horrible. The 'select' button didn't work most of the time, and the USB connector was very fussy.To make matters worse, it disconnected (bad USB connector) during download to my SD memory card and killed a $60 card.Then to add insult to injury, the customer service from RCA is absolutely awful. No phone support, very slow reply to email questions which led to a toll-call to a secret phone support number, during which the support person denied that the player could be at fault. When I asked to talk to her supervisor, she told me that no one there could help me.For fun, I tried to contact the corporate offices. They don't seem to exist.I would not recommend purchasing a Lyra, or anything else from RCA."
2,Cheap Construction,"This player was all that I wanted it to be when I bought it for my son - I even bought one for myself. Shortly thereafter, though, my son's battery compartment door broke - there's a tiny plastic tab that locks it closed. If mine hadn't broken shortly thereafter I'd say he was rough with it, but I know I wasn't. The plastic tab will first loosen, which VERY annoyingly shuts off the player in the middle of use, and then it will break off completely. It's a poor design (or perhaps this was what it was designed to do so you'd have to buy another). Now we have 2 MP3 players with taped-closed battery doors. I wouldn't buy another."
1,stops when bumped,Doesn't handle bumps and hits very well i.e. wearing while working out or gardening. The player just stops and goes to the first song. Does the same thing when battery life gets low. Not impressed with battery life.
1,Lemon,"Got it home, the software was easy, downloaded tracks successfully, then it wouldn't stay on...I mean not for 20 seconds...tried new battery after new battery, but that wasn't the problem.Funniest part was, when we returned it to Wal Mart, they simply wrapped it back up to put on the shelf for some other poor soul to bring home---they even left our downloaded tracks on it...The good news: The good news is that it came with one kid's promotional song preloaded on it that played fine before we tried to put our own music on there. So if you just want to pay $90 to hear ""Fish at the bottom of the sea""...go for it."
2,Not worth it!,"I purchased this product at Radioshack (for $110) a little over a month ago, and and first I was unbeleivably pleased. This machine held MOST of my music, it was small, and it was very simple to use. Without a memory card, it only held about 30 songs, therefor I bought a memory card for $75 which doubled my memory. Additionally, there is not backlight!Now it is worth $185 with the card and it only holds 67 songs. The machine started to turn off unintentionally, and the music was played with the vocalist being completely drowned out. I went back to Radioshack, and they gave me a new one. It isn't any better. I have been researching ipods and for $250, I could have 2500 songs! That is less than $75 more, and I'm sure the quality is better. Dont buy this product, because it was expensive for doing so little. I would go for the iPod!"
4,Great MP3 Player for running or just around the house...,"I bought my RCA LYRA RD1071 from Walmart about 2 months ago for $79.00. It is my second MP3 player and I have to say I am very pleased with it. I fit 50 songs on the built in 128 MB card (Using MP3PRO). The armband is great for running and a lot better then the belt clipped ones. Yes it will fit the upper arm, I have 17"" arms and I have no problem. The headphones took a little getting used to, but work great while running, I have never had an issue. The main feature I feel is missing is a backlight. If I am running at night I have a hard time seeing what buttons to push. No big deal though there is not that many buttons to mess with. To the person that is having problems with the songs skipping in the middle, that is probably a PEBKAC or ID10T error I would say. I have had no such problems."
1,Don't Buy It!,"I don't care what anyone else who's reviewed this item says, don't buy it. I bought one, got it home, and it kept freezing in the middle of songs--I had to actually pop the battery out to reset the player. I returned it immediately. I foolishly thought I must have a defective player and just got a replacement. That one worked well until shortly after the store's 14 day warranty ended then started acting up. It turns itself off as if on a whim. Sometimes it decides to skip. Sometimes it freezes in the middle of songs and I have to do the reboot thing. When the battery gets even half-way discharged, the player will turn itself off after every song it plays. I used to be able to carry it in my pocket, now if I do it skips or turns off so I have to carry it while I walk (I'm not an arm-band kind of girl though the player comes with one). It's just a pathetic player. Really, don't waste your money. I can't stress this strongly enough. I wish I'd bought ANYTHING else."
2,"good , but lasted an year.","Looked an excellent buy for its price and upgrade capability. Bought it in march 2003 and it finally started giving problems in aug 2004. Worked well till then.The problem I have now is that the audio can be heard only from one headset, there seems to be some problem with the output jack.I would recommend to buy the newer models."
3,I wanted to like it...,"and at first I loved it. It's great for working out because of its size and weight. But it stopped working after 3 months-- and I hadn't bumped it or anything. I sent it in for replacement and the company quickly sent me a new one, which I appreciated. However, that brand new one didn't work at all. Two friends of mine have the same player, 1 had to get hers replaced after 3 months also. The other ran over hers with a bike and it still works just fine. It's really a hit or miss product."
4,Good Product / Great Value,"Here is the good, the bad and the ugly regarding this mp3 player:The Good:1. 128MB with an expansion slot.2. Small and very lightweight.3. Excellent sound, particularly with DSP settings.4. Use of MusicMatch software. (Some hate it, I love it.)5. Pretty good battery life with only one AAA.6. Low price.The Bad:1. No belt clip and armband prevents access to controls.2. LCD is not backlit and has lo-tech look.3. Max volume could be a little louder.The Ugly:1. The headphones are straight out of The Flintstones.Overall, a solid value."
4,It's a great product.,"I bought this product yesterday and I am crazy about it. I bought it for $90 at Circuit City. It is a great product. I like the headphones and the armband, except for one thing. It would be nice if the armband had a clear plastic cover so you can see the song title and press the buttons like pause, stop, fwd., bwd, etc. while still keeping it covered. It would also be nice if the LCD screen had a backlight so you can read it in the dark. The volume is great, it goes so loud! It is so easy to just drag files to the player using Internet Explorer with Windows XP. MusicMatch software is very confusing. I can't figure it out. To convert CDs to MP3 files, I recommend dBpowerAMP at www.dbpoweramp.com. It is a very good product for converting files. It is a free download. It lets you choose many things, like compression size, and the destination file.Overall, this player is a very good player."
1,Major Flaw,"The device isn't bad on the whole, but the the extraordinary difficulty in getting a computer to ""recognize"" the device, enabling downloading, makes using it almost impossible. There is a magic formula (load software, turn computer off, turn comp. on, plug in cable to both computer and device, turn computer off, start again in different order, chant mantras etc.), but I've only stumbled across it once. As there's no telephone support, you're on your own. (the instruction manual is poorly written and confusingly organized) The software comes w/ a number of unrelated applications, that serve to make an irritating experience even more unbearable. After four days of tinkering, I returned mine."
1,I though it would be a good player.....,"I bought this player of a few days ago and i thought it would be great. I put some songs on it and it worked fine, until i was on track 17 and wanted to listen to track 8. I started pushing the ""previous"" button and all of a sudden i hear a loud pop in my ear and the system resets. This happened to me about 4 or 5 times before I decided to return it. I suggest not to buy from RCA...I have bought other products from them before and they turned out just like this one."
1,Stay away from the Lyra and ALL RCA/Thomson products,"When I bought this I had forgotten the horrible experience I had with an RCA e-Book reader three years ago. I've had no end of trouble with it, and as usual, RCA provides no customer support. There is no telephone number to call in the product literature and sending them an e-mail is just as effective as sending my cat an e-mail. Stay way from this Lyra, and stay away from RCA products in general. It will lower your stress level!I wish Amazon would let me give this ZERO stars, but one star is the lowest rating Amazon will allow."
5,Keeps on Ticking!!,"I absolutely LOVE this mp3 player! I received it as a gift in October 2003, and it still works as it did the day I got it! I'm a clumsy person and it's been dinged and knocked around. When it gets dinged a little too hard, it'll shut off, but turn it back on, it's good as new.It's definitely worth the money. I also love that XP immediately recognizes it and pulls it up as another drive. It makes it easy to change music when I'm in a hurry.I also bought an fm transmitter by Belkin (around $20) and it plays through my car stereo flawlessly.I like the earphones that came with them. My ears are tiny and earbuds hurt. I also clip them on my shirt when I'm not using them. This is truly a great buy and worth every penny!"
5,Great Product,"PROS:*small, lightweight, easy to use*great sound quality*holds about 60+ songs at onceCONS:*headphones are uncomfortable (i bought a different pair)*comes with an armband rather than a belt clip*after following instructions provided perfectly, musicmatch software did not recognize the player...if this happens to you, use the windows media player software instead. (another reviewer had this problem also.) after figuring that out, it was really easy to transfer songs.OVERALL: This is a great item that's easy and fun to use, once you get past the kink with their software."
2,Be prepared to install software patches.,"Don't buy this MP3 player if you are uncomfortable with downloading and installing software patches and manipulating hardware drivers on your PC. This player requires additional software updates from rca.com in order to make the music tracks play in the order you want, rather than in alphabetical order. Also, the installation directions from rca.com are not quite correct, so you'll have to rely on your personal experience with computers to successfully install the patch. Once this is accomplished, the player works OK. I also suggest looking at the online discussion boards for other pitfalls of this product. The users seem to know more about the product than RCA ... and there is NO toll-free technical support for this product."
4,Is This All?,"I got this mp3 player for my 14th birthday, and it's really, really awesome. I've never owned a MP3 player in my life, but this seems to be an awesome player. I've had trouble with fitting the player in the armband, though. The only thing I'm wondering is why can I only fit 12 songs on it? That really turned me off about it! Or maybe I just have huge mp3 files..."
2,Electronics Fan,"Just bought the MP3 player got it home downloaded some songs everthing was easy but when I play it not enough volume! Im a much older person then the generation who likes these kind of gadgets but I was disappointed (not enough volume) I have it turned all the way up and can hear my TV over it I even changed headpones to my Sony headpones still doesnt work! I like my music loud when Im listening to Ozzy, you young folks will be disappointed not enough cranking volume!! Too bad, its a neat MP3 player but its going back, I wonder if all the digital MP3 players have low volume??"
2,Its fantastic for about 10 months..,"ok this is a really great mp3 player until it breaks. im not saying yours will, but i had one for about 10 months and all of a sudden it just died. maybe this is my fault but i doubt it because it was never mistreated. anyways, this is a great mp3 player. it's light, it's small, it's functionable and it's cheap. but there might be a reason why this mp3 player may be ""too good to be true"". thanks"
2,Good for windows 2000 bad for windows ME,"I use two computers. The RCA Lyra 128 MB worked great on the computer with windows 2000. It literally took about 4 minutes to start loading songs. Unfortunately the computer with windows 2000 is at my work. My computer at home has windows ME. The RCA Lyra does not work with windows ME. I tried loading firmware, and plugins both from the enclosed CD and from websites, but the computer using Windows ME fails to recognize the device, and assign it a drive. It is too bad I don't have windows 2000 at home. I unfortunately have to return this and find another player."
4,Not stainless steel,"Walker markets a line of ""Quiet Flow SS"" (stainless steel) mufflers. This Saab muffler is constructed of ""aluminumized steel"" and is not stainless steel. ""Walker"" and ""Starla"" are just different branding for the same product. Walker 53059 cross references to Starla 19211. They are identical and both should fit like OEM. The Bosal alternative is usually less expensive (thought not necessarily lower in build quality). I don't have any experience installing Bosal on my Saab however I have hear that the metal is slightly thicker."
5,Excellent toy,"I bought the Fisher Price Doll House and accessories for my granddaughter, 3 1/2, and she just loves it. Her brother, 21 months also likes it. They both love the station wagon, too. Fisher Price toys are amazing--well made, creative, and cute! I have toys my children played with 30 years ago that are still in good condition--the grandchildren just love them."
3,CHARGING IT SUCKS,"First off, let me say that I have only had it for about 3 days. When I first got it, I was extremely suprised at the size. It is actully much smaller than the pictures make it look. It is a very stylish mp3 player, and the rechargable battery could have made it much nicer than many of its counterparts. The drawbacks: When navigating in the library or any other place, you can actully hear it working and loading. Now the worst part. When charging it it has to be hooked up to your computer... AND IT HAS TO BE ON! I was not happy at all when I discovered this, but I guess I should have read discriptions more closely. As far as I know the batteries are not removable or replacable (unless you use a screw driver). The screen does not look as nice as it does in the pictures, but it still looks fine. The sound quality is AWESOME. I personally think it sounds better than the I pod.If you'v got questions e-mail me atymkk@usa.com"
4,cool player,"I just got this player recently and it is a nice player. The screen isint as attractive as the picture shows it to be and the item is much smaller than i expected, which is a good thing. The sound is real nice, but the earbuds had one string longer than the other. anyways, its quite easy to use (for me) but if your having trouble, u just might have to figure out the functions on your own because the instruction booklet dosent tell much at all!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!,"This MP3 player is a peice of crap. I thought that I would get a good deal and a cool looking MP3 player, but it ended up sucking. It does not come with downloading software, and when you use the microsoft program for copying music, most songs don't work due to a copy protection. Also, the thing fried and froze up to where I could not even access the main screen in a matter of one hour. This is a horrible buy and a crappy deal."
5,One Of The Greatest Albums Ever Made.,"If anybody has anything bad to say about hip-hop, play them this album. Chuck D., Flava Flav, and Terminator X proved that hip-hop could be meaningful and intelligent. Chuck D.'s rhymes are classic, Flava Flav is at his comic best, and the cuts by Terminator X are top-notch. ""Night Of The Living Baseheads"" is one of the best anti-drug songs ever, ""Bring The Noise"" and ""Rebel Without A Pause"" will get you up out of your seat, ""She Watch Channel Zero"" is a great commentary track on the downside of television and perfectly fuses rap and rock, and ""Black Steel..."" is an intense story track. The production by the Bomb Squad is raw, loud, and brilliant. Get this album NOW! Even if you don't like hip-hop. This is one of the greatest albums ever made PERIOD!"
5,PUBLIC ENEMY,"WELL, BEING FROM ""THE OLD SCHOOL""...YOU KNOW, ""THE POSSITIVE ERA"", ITS HARD TO FIND TODAY'S HIP-HOP SATISFYING TO MY SOUL.......SO I GO BACK, AND THERE I FIND WHAT I NEED.PEACE"
5,Hip Hop Classic,"PE's second is a work of pure genius. A political masterpiece with probably some of the best songs ever heard. Favorites include Bring the Noise, Don't Believe the Hype, Terminator X to the Edge of Panic, Louder Than a Bomb, She Watch Channel Zero?!, Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos, and Rebel Without a Pause. A true classic in hip hop and should be own by all fans of hip hop. Highly Highly Recommended."
5,Classic old-skool rap,"This album is a straight up classic. This is the first public enemy album that i bought, and i'm definitely going to get more. I was sort of hesitant about buying any public enemy at first because i expected their style to be way different but its awesome. Anyway, i reccomend this to any fan of hip hop."
1,Where Have You BEEN All My Life?,"Why have I been wasting my time listening to Charlie Parker and Claude Debussy all these years? What ever made me think that Aretha Franklin and Gundula Janowitz could actually sing? I must have been high. THIS is the great work of true musical genius that all mankind has been waiting for. It marks the culmination and final, greatest achievement of the human race. What have we left to live for? It's all downhill from here, folks, so let's end it now, on a high note, and go out in a blaze of glory."
1,OVERATED,"THIS ALBUM IS RACIST, THE BLOODY BEEPING NOISE EVERY 2 LINES PISSES ME OFF, ITS PLAYED OUT DULL AND COMPLETELY OVERATED. HOW DID THEY MAKE SO MUCH MONEY OFF THIS GARBAGE ??, I WILL NEVER KNOW. HIP HOP IS MEANT TO BE FUN AND INTERESTING, IF YOU WANT EIGHTIES HIP HOP BY DE LA, OR TRY TRIBES CLASSIC FIRST 3 ALBUMS AND THE ROOTS PLEASE DONT TOUCH IT . ( AND THAT IS HELPFULL )."
1,Played out,"I think this album was played out too much back in the 80's, in addition I feel that this public enemey are anti-government and racist. I would not support them"
1,Want some good revolutionary rap? Listen to 50 cent,"This is crap. Really, who ever think this is a groundbreaking album or revolutionary needs to have their heads checked. This album is WACK and BORING! BORING! BORING! BORRRRRING! I can't stress that word enough. Oh and Check D talking about Elvis? Ok, in 20 years when Public Enemy would be forgotten, Elvis would still be selling and going platinum."
1,You call this music? Maybe on Planet Suck-ville,"This album is half baked, a nonsensical hodgepodge of militiant fight music and boring, repetitive beats. Who is bass? What are they talking about? If anyone understands What Chuck is talking about when he screams BASS at the top of his lungs then you belong on the same planet as these not very fab four. Two thumbs down Professor Griff. Check out Will Smith, Notorious B.I.G. or The Insane Clown Posse for better beats and a more uplifting, wholesome, positive message. Bashing the government is not cool, I don't think George Bush is listening to this record right now. And if our president can't listen to it, who should be allowed to? Certainly not you."
4,Let me hear that again.,"This is generally regarded as Public Enemy's best album. It's easy to see why, because it does feature many of their best songs. Like ""Bring the Noise"", ""Don't Believe the Hype"" and ""She Watch Channel Zero"". Believe the hype."
4,An essential,"An amazing CD, at least lyricaly, musically the cd gets a little onthe annoying side, songs such a Night of the Living Baseheads are great but i find myself half way through wondering if they put anythought into the production of the track at all, however still great cd go buy if you like hip hop"
3,Flava Flav ruined it for me,"This album has some good potential, but is ruined by Flava Flav's voice, similar, imo, to The Rated R ruining Thug Life Vol. 1 with his terrible little kid voice. Is Flava Flav 9 years old on this album? I will give It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back a few more listens and then update my review, but I would not give this my recommendation right now: I am very disappointed with it. Not sure what to say here, but if you want some late 80s rap check out Eric B and Rakim, BDP, or Big Daddy Kane instead."
3,lyrically excellent,"It Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back is a good rap cd, but not a great one. When I bought this disc i was excited, thousands of people told me it was the greatest rap cd ever made. I listened to it and found myself bored out of my mind. Its good- lyrically, and the beats are good but it is not the best rap cd ever made. I couldn't wait till the cd was over. if there was more of teminator x and chuck d id give it a five but flava flav is very annoying, every track he says ""BOYYYEEE"". good cd but overrated."
4,if flava flav wasnt there it would get a 5,this is the best country music album of all time but if they had gotten rid of flava flav it would be even better wazzup wit dem clocks!?!?
3,Ugh.,"Rapping is supposed to be fun! That's the problem with rap today. They've all been influenced by this serious political stuff, which is good, but too dang depressing. Get ""Paul's Boutique"" instead."
5,Epic.,"Simply put, this album brings music to a higher level that is only approached once or twice in a generation. It may be hard to listen to at first, but if you stick with it, you'll find yourself in absolute awe."
5,Message In Their Music,This simply a classic of Public Enemy. The best album they have made. This CD has hit after hit. I have always loved P.E. Chuck D. has the illest flow in the political aspect. He has let the world know of the crooked system of the world. This is the most poetic of their music. This album is a MUST HAVE!!
5,THE BEST HIP HOP CD OF ALL TIME!,"What more can you say about it? I got the cassette tape when it first came out in 1988. No other rap album has been able to surpass it. ""Message"" music seems to have become less popular over the years, but the message behind this cannot be denied. The struggle of the African Americans in this country and the stigma often attached is just as evident today as it has ever been. One might even suggest that Chuck D and the rest of Public Ememy were ahead of their time, especially when talking about police brutality and drug use amongst African Americans. My favorite cut is still Night of the Living Baseheads. They combine a little bit of humour with social awareness and racial awareness. Yes, they have meaningful lyrics, but no one can compare to the Terminator X's cuts. The music is off the hook. This is a CD that will have you partying while you feed your mind with knowledge. Party with a purpose!"
1,yannai schmanni,If I sang like that I'd probably be living in a homeless shelter. Yanni clearly does not have good abilities at singing. I mean I can sing better than Yanni and that's bad.
4,"""Til the Cows Come Home: Rock 'n' Roll Nebraska","A very enjoyable volume on the folks that made the midlands rock in the early days.Full of pictures and stories of kids who played and were famous and not so famous.I would like this book even if my band ""The Shades"" wasn't in it.Every middle aged person should see a copy to relive our youth and the kids that made the 60s and 70s so much fun!"
4,Cute,"There are a few Christmas songs on this CD that are traditional, but are given a Disney twist. Most are original. They're not bad, and any princess fan would enjoy this. The songs are sung by the original voices, of Ariel, Belle, and Jasmine, and they have new voices for Cinderella, Snow White, and Aurora, for obvious reasons. Snow White is actually better, the other two are up to par."
2,History or Novel,Ordered what I thought was history. It tuirned out to be a novel (i.e. fiction)Not what I really wanted. The info did not make this clear.
2,Bits of excitement nearly lost among long stretches of dullness,"Eleanor of Aquitaine must be one of the most interesting women in history. Her intellegence, her legendary beauty and her joint crusade with her first husband, the King of France would make for an amazing story alone. Now add to it that she was also the wife of King Henry II of England and the mother of Richard the Lionheart (and SEVERAL other children) and you have the makings of an epic story filled with love, betrayal, political intrigue and so much more! Instead, Lofts tells a nice story though uninspiring which touches areas of excitement briefly toying with them and then instead wanders down the a road that is interesting but dull. This is my third Norah Lofts novel and I am still seeking the same talent and style I found in A Wayside Tavern. I am again left disappointed and wondering how the same woman wrote that book and this."
2,Dull Account of a Fascinating Person,"Although the writing is fair in this book, I was disappointed by the lack of depth to the characters, including Eleanor. This is one of the most fascinating queens in history, whose story is multi-faceted. However, this book only scratches the surface of Eleanor's life. It does not develop the relationship between her and Henry (or their sons, for that matter), which is a major pivoting point in Eleanor's life. I did like Eleanor's prison companion, Kate, and thought her character was not as flat as most were in this book. And what about the Princess Alys, who was betrothed to Richard from a young age? This book doesn't even go into the possibility of the rumored relationship between King Henry (Richard's father) and Alys as being the reason Richard called off the betrothal. I would not recommend purchasing this book unless you can find it for a quarter or less."
4,Well Written Account of Eleanor's Sad Life,"I think Norah Lofts is an excellent writer of historical fiction & this book was very well done, however, it is not a story with many happy moments for Eleanor of Aquitaine. I usually will re-read books that I enjoy, but I find this one too sad to want to read it again - Eleanor just can't get a break, it seems. I've read Jean Plaidy's Plantagenet books involving Eleanor and she's presented in a less accurate but somehow more cheerful way in those books. This is certainly a more accurate account, but just not something that will put many smiles on your face."
1,Bad recording,Need I say more but a very poor master tape was used on this particular CD (sounds like a beat up cassette tape).
3,James Herriot Book Set.,The pages are very yellow and difficult to read. They are also somewhat brittle. Overall they are okay but I wish I would have paid less for this purchase.
2,Disappointed,"I ordered the set of 4 paperbacks by James Herriot and am pretty sure they had been listed as being in ""good"" condition. Well, one had writing in it, another had such badly dog-eared pages including the cover which had a big crease running through it, the others had scratches, dog ears, even a torn page. I was too embarrassed to give this set as the present I had intended. At best I would say it should have been listed as in ""fair"" condition, certainly not ""good""!"
5,All creatures great & small + All things bright & beautiful,The seller sent me one book with first 2 stories in it. It was supposed to be four books. I accept that change without being asked. But the seller never sent the second book. I have emailed several times without any response at all. I will never buy from this seller again.
4,"Fun, but maybe not appropriate for young children","The book has a total of 18 short fun rhymes, that I am sure most kids would love.The illustrations are very fun, even though the colors are a bit too ""muddy"" for my taste.Some of the rhymes *might* not be appropriate for young children (there is one about an ear getting cut off while cutting hair, one about a man with 17 noses (the image is a bit creepy) and one of a kid with his eyes inside out (not as bad as it sounds, but still a bit creepy).If you have very young children, I would recommend you check out the interior pages before purchasing the book."
3,"A little to ""dark"" for our daughter","I have enjoyed most of Bill Grossman's books, although some of them seem to be a little too ""dark"" for our daughter. I liked most of these poems as did my daughter. However, several of them seemed a little inappropriate and my daughter was noticeably uncomfortable with them (the words and/or illustrations). We no longer have the book and will stick with the other Grossman books in our library."
5,Comfortable,Comfortable chair for my tall/large husband. It did need the side ropes replaced after a year of much use.
4,Good but.....,"This is the only MP3 player i own. I got it for christmas in '04. Its really good and its small. It holds about 30 songs on it. and you can but memory cards for it. but after a couple of months, it wouldnt turn out. so i had to ship it out and get a new one. Hey it was free. So i had to re-put my songs on it and i was fine. As of now i cant find mine! I think my brother took it cause he lost his. who knows. If you want a good MP3 Player this is a good one."
2,Poor Quality,"I bought this for my daughter for christmas and in less thn 1 month she complained that she needed to wiggle the headset plug to get good audio. I disassembled the unit to find that there was poor solder joints on the headset jack. RCA, if you want to keep any reputation, we need better quality from you!"
1,NOT FOR MAC USERS!!,"I will never trust an RCA product again. On the package, this player claims that it is compatible with Mac OS. After having problems playing music that I had dragged to the player, I called technical support. They informed me that they didn't have instructions for Mac users and they prefer you to use Windows. When I told them it said that it was compatible with Mac, the support person informed me that ""It's only possibly compatible with Mac. We prefer you use Windows.""This is the most ludicrous thing I've ever heard of. It's complete false advertising, and I'm furious. It's a waste of money."
1,Don't waste your money on RCA Lyra mp3 player,"You barely tap this thing and it turns off. when you restart, you start back at the beginning, even if you were on song 30. After about a year now, mine plays half a song and just turns off. The ear phones supplied with it are bad also. And the ear phone plug is touchy. You have to twist the earphone connector just right to hear both ears. Spend an extra $30 and get an mp3 player that has anti-skip technology."
4,Very happy,"Just got this little thing for Christmas. Worked right out of the box. Plugged it into a Win2K machine without bothering with the accompanying software. It was recognized, and I could jsut drag and drop. 64 MB players are becoming tougher to find. Very happy with this one."
2,mp3 playa,well i bought this because i droped my cd player and it broke in half. about a week after i got it the volume up clicker thing broke and another week after that the volume down clicker broke too so I have to hold it if I want to get the volume up or down. The battery life is not good. Either buy bulk batterys for it or get some rechargable ones. the only thing i do like about it it does have some good bass and it does still kinda work.
2,common defect,"My brother and I both recieved the RCA 64 MB Lyra for Christmas, it is June and both of our players have developed the same problem. If something so much as touches the part of the player that is slid down to insert the battery it turns off. This is probably a pretty common problem since both of our players developed it. So 6th months after purchase our players are useless. RCA will replace them and I hope they send the upgrade because I will not be happy to have to keep replacing my player every 6 months."
4,rca lyra,"i just love this little thing, i wanted to be able to listen to music while i worked but did not want everyone to notice that i was jamming, the rca lyra is so small it fits in my pocket i did not like the e-clipz headphones so i bought a pair of sony ear plugs, now about the software it's kinda buggy but i use it anyway you can also use windows media player if you want but i stuck with musicmatch i was able to get 28 songs on my built in memory if i burn them as wma at 64kbps over all this is neat little gadgit... oh yeah it gobbles batteries but it only uses one AAA so that is ok anyways if you want a mp3 player buy the rca lyra"
1,Not a very durable product!!,"I was very excited to get this player because of the reviews I had read. Man, have I been dissappointed!I've owned two only to have both break within 2 months. The first one fell on the cement when the velcro on the armband gave out while I was bending over. The headphone jack on the second one went south about seven weeks after I bought it. The left speaker cuts in and out and every once in a while the player will stop playing music and replace it with a very high pitched squeal that won't stop until you pull out the battery. It doesn't feel very good on the ole eardrums!I don't know if I just bought two bad units or if this is how they are, but either way I won't be buying anymore."
5,"Small, easy to use, & inexpensive","I was pretty much a MP3 novice before purchasing the Lyra. I couldn't be happier with this unit. It's super small (great for exercising), inexpensive, and easy to use. I installed the included software and attached the computer cable and was transfering files and songs just moments after opening it. The sound quality is superb with plenty of volume. The 64MB is plenty for me -- about 15 songs, and contrary to other reviews -- I think the headphones are great! I'm really pleased after 4 months use. I've since researched other players and I'm happy this is the player I bought. Small, easy, and inexpensive."
2,Disappointed,Exactly as others said the jack is definitely a problem and only after 2 months. This player had such great potential to then be loss to such a simple problem. I dont know if I could ever consider another product from them.
2,Look out Mac users!!,"I got this product last month while traveling and it worked great when I loaded my first set of music onto it (from a PC). The trouble started when I loaded additional music onto it using a different computer. I can only guess that I attempted to load conflicting file types, because the machine hasn't worked right since. The music comes out 'pixilated' - you can hear some of the music but not the words. It's as if the music is inside out somehow.When I returned home I hooked the little thing up to my Mac and the computer didn't recognize that it had ANY files on it, but the lack of available memory confirmed that those suckers were on there. Imagine my *shame* when I had to bring the player to a friend's P.C. to access the drive and erase the files.To make matters worse, this player apparently will not accept music downloaded/purchased from the iTunes on-line music store.Sign me, ""Saving for an iPod"""
1,DONT BUY THIS,"This mp3 player is a piece of s**T. buy anything but!!! Mine went on the fritz after less than a week. I dont know whats wrong, but I download stuff to it, and it won't play it. take my advice- get another one."
2,Too much history.. not enough ghost info.. BAD editing,This has got to Be the most annoying book to read.. there is at least one error in spelling or the way a sentence is written on EACH page. Makes the flow of reading very difficult.I am half way through this and am bored. WAY TOO MUCH historical facts and not even close to nearly enough about the actual haunting. Most stories go for 2-3 pages of history then ONE PARAGRAPH with maybe two sentences about the haunting.NOT worth reading. I gave it a 2 simply for interesting pictures.
3,hauntingly weird,"Informative, I like his books. Most of the stories I have read in other books but some I have not. I like that he writes about the history behind the haunts, not just tell about the hauntings."
4,Nice Book,"This book provides comfort for those who fear death. I would also like to recommend another book Titled: Hunting The Dead ""methods of ghost chasing"". This book is related as it talks about death, spirits, angels, etc.."
4,Beyond the Grave: The History of....most Huanted Graveyards,"I must disagree with one review regarding ""Beyond the Grave."" One reviewer found it highly irritating that the editors did not discover and/or correct some occurring typos in Troy Taylor's book. Petty,overlooked accidents do happen,such as they are. Enjoy Mr. Taylor's offerings. A true page turner!"
1,Horrible,"I have been pumping this freaking machine since 1:30pm when it arrive. I have used both arms, both feet... This is the worst filter I have ever owned. Nothing should be this difficult to use when it is brand new. I have followed every direction to the T and the water gets about half way up the intake tube when I pump, regardless of how long or hard I pump. This filter sucks and will be going back. Awful!!!!!! Stay away!!!!! Would rate it zero stars if the system would allow me to."
5,Awesome,Works great! It is very quite when the cabinet door is shut you cant hear this system at all running great buy!
1,CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP NOISY,My EHEIM went bad and I needed a filter quickly. After reading the reviews on this site decided to give this a try. I could not wait and went to PetCo which was $40.00 more than Amazon. Glad I paid the $40 more as I'd hate to ship this crap back.All I can say is CHEAP and NOISY and difficult to prime. I'm hoping PetCo takes this back. The plastic used is the kind that breaks easily. If PetCo does not take it back I'll smash it at the return counter.Read the reviews here and give it a try for yourself. You will kick your self for buying this unless you are strapped for cash.CHEAP CHEAP....
1,piece of junk,it had issue with pumping lots need lots of manual intervention to start the flow. it died after few months.
5,"Great canister, great price.",For the money this is the greatest filter. I've tried several other canister filters and they all end up leaking. I've had one of these a year now and no problems. Its very quiet too! I now have another one on a second tank.
5,William's thoughts,"the cascade 1000 canister filter was everything i expected. Is very quality, and easy to set up. It run quit and increased the current inside my aquarium.."
5,"Good for an intermediate student, nice illustrations","This book begins with a short history of music, describing how different types of 'classical' written music evolved from the 14-15th century to the present century. Then, it has one page samples of the different types of classical music (opera, hymns, descriptive, spiritual,..) along with a brief description of the author, or the music. I liked the diagrams that illustrated these descriptions. In the back of the book are hints for playing the pieces. This book is good for an intermediate student, and gives a nice overview of classic music."
2,""" A Struggle For Me ""","I like Smoke Jenson; he is strong and stands for good and right, but after reading other Last Mountain Man stories I could pretty much tell you what was going to happen around each bend in the trail. Smoke leaves his Wife on the ranch in the High Lonesome to save someone from bad guys. He kills many who don't backdown, lets the ones go who turn chicken, and turns very few over to the ""Law"". The same thing happens in other stories with different characters. This series needs some imagination and creativity or I may stop reading it."
2,one of the weakest,"I've read around 40 of WWJ's books and loved most of them but this (along with all the J.A. Johnstone books) is among the weakest. It doesn't have the feeling of many of the other books. It's set in San Fransisco, his opponents are Chinese workers, it just didn't work."
2,This souffle collapsed!,"Take a lot of bad, second-rate, low-budget gay American movies, make them Indian, and you have this untasty dish. The film moves sssllooowww. The timing is off. The actors are all stock characters: the flamboyant one, the actor trying to hide, the guy on the down low, the straight female best friend, and the ""gay everyman"" main character. Surprisingly, the supporting actors are cuter than the main actor, unlike in most Western, gay films. I loved that this film shows that there are gay-identified men in India. However, homophobia on the subcontinent is never brought up. No character critiques this legalized bigotry brought over by the English imperialists. This was disappointingly apolitical, especially coming from characters that are supposed to be sharp, hip, and class-privileged. The one thing I loved about this movie is that many men with sexy, hairy chests are featured."
3,strange candy,"Not the book i thought it would be, do enjoy knowing some of the things she has left out because anita blake is one of my fav series."
2,Not the best,This is not the best of Laurell K Hamilton's works in my opinion. It is mediocre and I cannot say I would recommend it to anyone.
1,Dark.,"I have to say that with the exception of the cupid story the over-all affect of this book brought me down. Granted it wasn't the 100% sex writing that she's turned into, however it was possibly the exact flip side. All the stories together resulted in a sad book."
3,Strange Candy Review,"The title isn't what you expect, at least the candy part. The strangeness of the stories are great, full of color and puzzlement. Without going into detail, I would advise a clear mind. Don't expect the Blake character to dominate the book, there is one story devoted to her and it is pretty nice."
4,Not her best but still worth the read,"Not her best, but it is still worth the read. I enjoyed it though it did drag at times and one or two stories could have been left out. If you're looking for her sexy, sensual writing this ain't it. I bought the MP3 audio CD and the reader helped. If you want Hamilton at her best stick to Anita or Merry, they won't disappoint."
4,variety sampler,"Very good mix of short dark fantasy stories. Rich details that draw you in. I like her style. My first read of this author, I was impressed (a friend recommended her Anita Blake series)."
3,A Mixed Bag,"""Strange Candy"" was a mixed bag of some of Laurell K. Hamilton's old short stories, plus one new one. Some of the stories were pretty good, and I enjoyed them, others weren't very good; mostly, the stories that were ""high fantasy"" with mages. etc. In those stories the characters speak in that wooden cliched style that people seem to think they should speak in. It was also interesting to see how the one new story lost track of the plot, much like her more recent novels do."
4,Fun and Funny,"This is a collection of short stories, discarded chapters/story lines from other books, etc...They are very entertaining, well written, and a few just totally cracked me up. (But then I have a mother who would hire cherubs too - if they were real! Sorry not going to tell you about the story in the book relating to that comment - it would spoil it for those who haven't read this yet & those who have read it will know what I mean.)It's also a great book if you are very busy and don't have time to get involved in a story. If you just have the time for a chapter or two now and then this is perfect because that is all the longer these stories tend to be. Very entertaining.R Walker"
3,Entertaining...,"First, allow me to say that this book is not necessarily literature. However, it has fun imagery and a great sense of character development. That is one of Laurell K. Hamilton's strongest assets as a writer...her innate sense of exploring the mind of her characters. This allows her stories to flow with emotion. The reader can connect with the character - that is truly what engages the reader and makes the story worth reading.All in all, I would recommend this as a bright read. After all, we are living in a rather dark world right now. It is great to have a story that holds you."
3,Strange - but tasty - candy,"It's a decent collection of short stories, with the dark sensual atmosphere that one expects from Laurell K. Hamilton. The stories range from high fantasy to (allegedly) sci-fi. The quality also ranges - from okay to excellent. The excellents - ""Here Be Dragons"" - more than make up for the okay stories, and the quality is always at least enjoyable. It is good - if strange - candy, not high literature but not meant to be either. It is enjoyable, and that is enough."
3,Disappointing,"I love Laurell K Hamilton and buy and read all her books. I bought this while in between Meredith Gentry and Anita Blake novels. While I enjoyed the stories, it felt choppy. I wanted more and was left frustrated at the end of many of the stories, plus the total volume of new material was less than I would have liked. The writing was great, however, and a couple of the stories really got under my skin. I enjoyed her commentary on each story, the little glimpse into her mind interesting."
5,Pleasantly Surprised !!!,"Okay where to start, if you are one of those readers who loved the early Anita Blake series, but are not so impressed with the last few to get released then you will probably love this book. I think I loved every one of these stories except the last one, which I had already read in another short story anotholgy book a few years back.I hope LKH has more old stories tucked away somewhere."
5,See?,"She can write and excellent story (stories) without burying it in endless creative sex. These stories are a collection of various places in her very creative worlds. No Merry Gentry story but two Anita stories an early one and a more evolved later one. And some stories from the world of Nightseer. Ms Hamilton has a very good grasp of how short stories work and an excellent ability to make them pop. The pacing is totally different. The difference between a sketch and a painting. She does it well. Now if we could just get her to do this with the Anita novels: more story, less paint."
2,Tears Easily,"I've gone through two of these. The grey at least, tears easily.Otherwise I would really like this case. It's a low profile case, makes it easy to tuck your phone in your pocket."
4,"Functional, with additional features","In addition to the features listed in the product review, this radio also has a battery back up. The front panel is huge, angled, and hard (impossible) to set things on. The displayed numbers are smallish. Reception can be very sensative to how the power cord is routed. Despite the few disadvantages, I like this clock radio, especially the digital seek tuning with 10 presets. It appears that it has the capability for the two alarms to tune to different stations, but I didn't test it."
3,Public Enemy - Yo! BumRush The Show,It's a good CD but not Public Enemys best. I'd definatley buy it though if you are a Public Enemy fan of Hip Hop fan. But I Think Nation Of Millions is a better LP.
4,The one that started it all.,"1987's ""Yo! Bum Rush The Show"" is probably one of the more underrated hip-hop debuts of the 80's. Most people tend to compare it to the three classic albums that P.E. would release after this, which is a big mistake. If you're looking for another ""It Takes A Nation of Millions To Hold Us Back"" or ""Fear of a Black Planet"", you'll be disappointed. Simply put, ""Yo! Bum Rush The Show"" is in a league of it's own. Chuck D.'s flow, along with P.E.'s overall sound on ""Yo!..."" is reminiscent of other old-school rap groups, most notably Run-D.M.C. Like Run-D.M.C., a lot of the songs are dominated by an impressive display of turntablism, but what really made Public Enemy stand out was Chuck D.'s revolutionary lyrics and Flava Flav's outbursts. Overall, ""Yo! Bum Rush the Show"" is a good representation of the golden age of rap, although it doesn't compare to the next three albums the group would release. Still, this is a fantastic debut from one of hip-hop's greatest groups."
3,"aahh, its AIIGHT","This is the first cd from PE, one of the greatest rap groups of all time. I bought this album excpecting alot more then what i heard but i had heard ""nation of millions"" before listening to this and that if i hadnt heard that before this, it might have gotten a better rating. If you want to hear PE at there best, go pick up ""It takes a nation of millions to hold us back"", on ""YO! bum rush the show"", check out ""Public Enemy #1"", and ""Megablast""."
1,"dull, dreary, repetitive dribble","Never have i had to endure such a droll album. Maybe if i were sixteen again and was sporting a big bomber jacket, kangol hat and big chunky necklace with the words ELECTRO in 22ct gold ! i could be forced into having a bit of a groove to it however at 29 yrs old i really am past this rubbish with a more mature ear able to appreciate a far greater spectrum of contempary sounds. I would also like to remark on the similarity with the late JOE LUCEYS album BRIGHTON to LEEDS."
1,"Poorly written, not at all informative","This book is like reading a trashy tabloid - lots of flashy big colour photos, low on substance. Obviously trying to cash in on current interest in forensics, each chapter is poorly written and is accompanied with 3 or 4 case studies.The material in each chapter seems to be just common sense any adult could write about after doing minimal research and the case studies are too short, repetitive and sometimes don't even make sense.Very disappointing. I suspect this book is intended for age group around 8-15 although it never says this anywhere."
2,Get rid of the HARD peas...Please.,"I LOVE all of your soups!!!!!! They are amazing, very tasty and so easy to make! The only thing my girlfriend and I can't stand are the hard peas in your chicken noodle soup. They don't soften up no matter how long you cook it. Why is that? Your pea soup is my personal favorite!!!!!...no hard peas there. :) Anyway, keep up the great work...and soften the peas...Please.Drew from NH"
3,soup,I needed a replacement soup mix for a function I work at. The old supplier will not sell in our small quantity. (20 gal) I purchased this mix as a trial with others. This one lost. I was weak in flavor. It did not have much chicken pieces in it. (common problem with mixes.
5,Was this album recorded by an earthling?,I cannot believe my ears. This album is amazing! The combination of Indian and Russian music was something I never even thought of.This album is now the CD that has been played the most in my player.I HIGHLY recommend this album to anyone with a need to explore the unknown.
5,Better than the cartoon series,"This full-length animated feature is excellent, and much better than any single episode of the animated Sabrina TV series. There's more magic! Tons of zaps and spells.The voices are different, however. Emily Hart, Melissa's younger sister, did the voice of cartoon Sabrina in the series, while Melissa did the voices for Aunts Hilda and Zelda. Not on this DVD, but that doesn't matter. Salem sounds more like Paul Lynde, but that's ok too.Buy it, buy it, buy it!"
3,"Many mistakes, but ok...","This movie was nice but there were any mistakes.1. It's explained in the cartoon that a half-mortal turns into a full witch/warlock when they are 16 not 13, otherwise the girls used that full witch spell.2. Sabrina could fly and drive a broom in the cartoon.3. How on Earth did the Spellmans go to the Netherworld(or Other Realm in Sabrina the Teenage Witch)'cause they must go to the shower or the attic.4. Why does Salem sound surprised when he said ""Hey, you did magic!""? Sabrina was casting spells scince she was 4! and Salem has seen her do magic b4.5. Salem is grey. (DIC needs to watch the reruns again...)the movie was ok but everyone (except Portia, Nicole, and the other witches) were bad. Hilda, Zelda, and Salem were the worst!but it's cool anyway...:)"
2,The 1st Animated Movie,Just an ok movie.It's about a young Sabrina who goes to a hogwarts like school and the students treat her diffrent because she is half mortal on her 13th birthday.
4,A fun holiday album,You can tell that the musicians had a fun time making this album and love Christmas.
2,Cheaply made...,"I bought this toilet seat mainly because of the price. Like they say, if you buy cheap you gotta buy twice. The seat is made of cheap plastic, it slides constantly. I have installed many toilet seats before which I never had to adjust, maybe once a year. I had to adjust this one every week, I got so frustrated that I threw it out and bought a new one.The only reason why I left 2 stars out of 1 is because it is semi-comfortable. Besides that, it is trash."
2,If you like toilet surfing.....,"This seat does not attatch securely to the base. When you sit down, it slides and you about break your neck!! Ours broke in half. No thank you, toilet surfing is not in my future!"
4,pretty good toilet seat,good seat but it feels a tad less durable than most soft seats.still i would buy it again
5,Essential possession for all serious readers,"It may seem strange for Amazon.com to be selling a toilet seat. But if you're like me, then you've learned nearly everything you know in the bathroom. Hence, a seat is mandatory. I have the white version, which goes with just about anything. In fact, it's good to get a couple - a backup in case of emergency. I'm a purist, so I like the basic, no-frills model that perfectly unites form and function. But if you're the type who likes a few embellishments, you may want to get one with an optional reading light, and a pencil holder. Those pencils come in handy for you constipated mathematicians out there too. It's also a good idea to get some toilet paper. Amazon has a wide selection of that, too. Some of it even comes in book form, a nice touch for you modest souls and immodest critics."
5,AD makes great album,"3 Years, 5 Months And 2 DAys in the Life Of Is one of the greatest rap cd's ever made. Its not just the greatest rap cd ever made it is one of the greatest cd's ever made in the music industry. The best songs on this cd are Mr.Wendal, People Everyday (Metamorphosis Mix), Tennessee, Natural, And Give A Man A Fish. Arrested Development is know as one of the greatest bands of all time just by making this cd. Zingalamaduni is also a good album by AD it never had a hit like the ones on this CD."
5,Too good to miss!,"This music still sounds fresh 10 years after its release! I am SO looking forward to new music from this group - our world needs its positivity in this day and age. Tennessee remains my favorite on this CD, followed closely by Mama's Always On Stage and Raining Revolution. Spirit filled music from musicians blessed beyond belief, with a style that's sure to please fans in several genres, this CD is a must have!"
4,Arrested Development's Debut Is Packed With Tunes That Work,"This album is a mixture of rap, R&B, alternative, and reggae all rolled up into one terrific effort of a record.Speech's rhymes are filled with feeling, awareness, protest, anger, and even love. The thought-provoking ""Mr. Wendel"" is a good testimony on how we as Americans treat the homeless and down-on-their luck people. ""Tennessee"", filled with great beats and lyrics is a cry for equality.I am most impressed with ""Children Play With Earth"" and ""People Everyday"", which has a familiar Toyota jingle ring to it...actually Curtis Mayfield's song put to a call for help on the way some people are and can be. I really like this record a lot."
5,---------,"There are no words to describe how much i liked this CD. Very nice stuff. This CD was beautiful. THe music is a breath of fresh air compared to ""hip-hop"" on mainstream today. Nice stuff, nice stuff. Get it!Thumbs up fo' sho'"
1,Shows its age in 1999,"Track 4 sums up what's wrong with this CD: the band is totally self absorbed. They devote a track to a kind of live-show announcement, reeling off the band members' names and roles. The worst is delivered by Speech, who let's us know more than once that yes, he is the LEADER. Good for you, Speech.This is music that needed a few more months of fermentation, and a better producer. As is, it shows a pretty immature grasp of songwriting and way too much earnestness in its social message.It's late 1999 as I write this; if you haven't got this CD already, skip it. It's not worth getting at this point in music history."
4,Great remixes!,"I really like this CD and plan to get some of the other volumes. These are some of the best remixes of 80s music I've heard, I especially like ""The Reflex"", ""Living On Video"" and ""Blue Monday""."
4,Import/Export Disc Quality Review,I'm happy with the quality of the disc as well as the speed with which it was sent to me.
3,This ain't Wrestlemania 3!,"The pay-per-view was good enough to make fans happy (Sting beats Hogan). However, Malenko and Eddy did not live up to expectations. Luger should have jobbed cleanly to Bagwell. Hogan should be making more crappy made for tv movies. Nash's no show was a let down. But followers of wcw get what they want, the demise of Hogan!"
3,THE MATCH A YEAR AND A HALF IN THE MAKING......,"Overall, the 97 version of Starrcade delivers a average show with the heavily hyped Sting-Hogan battle on top, but with a somewhat misfired undercard (Kevin Nash no-shows his bout w/ the Giant) that brings the show down a bit from it being WCW's biggest event of the year."
1,Horrible,WCW has never had a decent PPV and this one's no exception. Save your $50 and order a WWF PPV and a few pizzas with it.
2,WCW advertised big matches but most of them didn't happen!,"So WCW spends about 16 months hyping this whole Sting/Hogan thing and then ruins it in the weeks heading up to Starcade. Was is ok? Yes, it was, but it wasn't fantastic. This event was also hurt by the Nash/Giant match not happening, the Beniot/Raven match not happening and the DDP/Curt Hennig match not taking place in a steel cage like it was menioned it would before. Trust me folks, this one ain't worth $50!"
5,TREMENDOUS PAY PER VIEW,i was at the event and let me tell you something everyone was pumped up at the event. from the guerrerro match which was excellent to the raven/benoit match to the hogan/sting which was a great main event. Overall a marvelous show a little bit of everything for everyone!
1,Starrcade was rip off city,Only good match was Malenko was Gurrero and that was only ***3/4. The rest was crap and the screwjob at the end of the Hogan vs. Sting match was horrible.
2,Poor Effort,"Some will like the Hogan/Sting match if you have been waiting to see the two collide and have yet to see it. However, the match several years late and both are past their prime (well, Hogan was never a good worker). Malenko and Guerrero have a match that would be good for a house show; however, this match can't even be compared to some of their previous match-ups. Those matches redefined the face of pro wrestling in the United States back in 1995, but this one only stands out because the rest of the card is boring."
1,"This is not the ""Grandaddy of them all""","I saw this thing on PPV, and it was horrid. Possibly the second worst Starrcade ever, 1994 being the worst ever. If you want a Real Starrcade, I suggest you check out the ones from the 80's and possibly 1996."
2,Starcade Dissapoints,"This was suppossed to be the biggest WCW PPV ever....instead it ended up being one of the most dissapointing. The main event was a huge letdown. It was very screwy and not executed properly. Not enough good cruiserweight matches to balance the flow of the show. Too many heels went over the babyfaces in an event where most of the faces should have went over. Several wrestlers no-showed this event as well. I have no idea why a 3 1/2 year old tape is being sold for ... when it was ... to see it live. It may be worth a look because of its historical value, but please don't plop down ... for it."
2,WCW Garbage,"By Ontonio ( I got on Wrestling Radio ) Payne. The average crappy WCW PPV with only a few good matches, a non match and the main event were Sting has the duty of carrying Hogan to a sub par quick ( like 10 minutes ) world title match. See Nick Patricks consistent 3 count and Bret "" SCREW "" Hogan. Also features some decent work by Guerro v. Malenko, DDP v. Hennig and Saturn v. "" The Internet Wrestling God "" Chris Benoit. Only for the diehard WCW fan. ( are there any ) Rent it!"
2,WCW Starrcade 1997 review,"The cruiserweight title match between Eddie Guerrero & Dean Malenko was a hot opener but not their best work. The 6 man tag team match between Team NWO(Scott Norton,Vincent & Randy Savage) & Team WCW(Ray Traylor,Rick Steiner & Scott Steiner) was not great but pretty good. The Bill Goldberg-Steve McMichael match was not good but at least it was fairly short. The Perry Saturn-Chris Benoit-Raven's Rules match while not a bad bout,the stupid rules eliminated any chance of a good match too. The Buff Bagwell-Lex Luger match stinks like a 27-year old hamburger. The US title match between Curt Henning & DDP was 10 minutes of nothing. The Larry Zbyszko-Eric Bischoff match was horrible. The World title match between Hulk Hogan & Sting was short,awful & stupid. I give this PPV a 2 out of 10."
2,Roman Chariot,This was bought for my cousin's son. He loved it. The pieces are very small and are easy to loose.
5,Great series,"love the whole series , all the characters flow from one book into the others, blows me away how this Author can produce such a good series, what a wonderful talent they as writer's have, be lucky to string 2 sentances together 9Asuch as this) and make sense...LOL..Buy the whole series"
2,Area 51,Did not finish the book. Hard to follow and too difficult to keep up with all the character and plots.
2,Review,I did not like this one as much as the nightstalker. This one seemed to drag on compared to the nightstalker.
2,Area 51: Excalibur,"Started reading these with the first novel... By the time I got to this one, the rehashed plot was becoming boring and, while the first 2 or 3 held my attention, it all just got tooooooo unbelieveable... In all honesty, I am a myster buff and rarely read science fiction... *:\"
3,Another Popcorn Sci Fi Novel - but I read it.,"I was once intrigued by these Area 51 books; being a fun and quick read. But then I realized that he has managed to cram what should have been 2 books (maybe 3) into 6 books. The story is fast and readable, but it also seems like he is trying to get into his stories every single myth, mysterious object, and story ever known into the thread of this and his other books. The story of Aliens having been here for thousands of years (Atlantis) and then having gone to sleep (why?), to return to plague the humans with ridiculous situations, in a never-ending story, seems a bit much. Doherty has some good stuff in these stories, nonotech ideas, and has managed to keep my interest in the story enough to consider reading his final novel in this series.If you want a simple and enjoyable read without having to exercise your brain to much (beach or vacation reading), this one will do."
3,Area 51-Excalibur,"The series continues. Reading the first fifty pages one questions all that has gone before. Information and events flow fairly evenly thoughout until the last fifty or so pages when everything speeds up to an almost frustrating pace.A new twist to the Excalibur Legend used as a hook to interest those whose interest may not be ""aliens"". Just when you think it's over, another chapter is forthcoming in summer '02."
3,Area 51: Excalibur,"A good storyline tires from lack of an ending. Each story has potential but when you reach the 'last' page you wonder what happened to the rest of the book.If you have the time, read them all and you will enjoy fun read."
4,prime poetry experimentalism,"Shillock is a journeyman poet from the Twin Cities and, before that, New York. His seasoned wordcraft is clear in this, the first media poetry collection dedicated exclusively to his work. It's a delicious experiment with the mission of extending the experience a live reading from the stage to the reader's desktop. Shillock uses video productively in the clips he includes on the disc, which (in my experience) played flawlessly in Windows Media Player. There are rough edges here and there, true enough. But this is the kind of media poetry anthology one wants to reward and encourage, to see what the artist may accomplish as he masters the medium in fuller strokes. It's prime poetry experimentalism, and you, good reader, are invited to the Ball."
4,Nice,Great product but color was described differently. Other than that it is comfortable to wear and doesnt hurt my shoulders one bit with a 5 pound laptop inside.
5,"The only one, so the best one.","I agree with most of the criticisms aimed at this book. However, it is the only book of its type. This makes it the best you can get. It is, for better or worse, the best education you can get from the only book thus far on the subject. I would like to have seen more and better pictures, as well as an in depth history, but I have no regrets in buying this book. As for the prices being out of line, check eBay to see what people are actually paying. You will be lucky to find yo-yos as cheap as in the book! This book is, for now, the definitive book on yo-yo collecting."

2,It was a good start.,"I agree with most of the other reviews here, not too great. I got this at the same time I got Lucky's Collectors Guide to 20th Century Yo-Yos and I have to say it is a pale shadow of luckys book. Chriss Cooks book can't have more than 40 or 50 yo-yos listed, in comparison Lucky's Collectors Guide has photos of over 1000 yo-yos, and thousands of prices, extensive history. Heck, its amost a half inch thicker and its 8-1/2x11 inchs Its huge. I think I would have liked this book a lot if I had not seen Lucky's Collectors Guide."
3,This book was ok...,This book is not exactally a book on history. it has more of the prices of the yo-yo than the history. I thought that this was a book on all of the history of the yo-yo. I would recomend not gettin this book if your looking for the history of the yo-yo.
1,Incomplete and lacking in many areas,"Although a guide to yo-yos themselves is welcome to collectors and others, this book is seriously incomplete and lacking in many areas. For example, there are far too many yo-yo models that are missing from the guide (either in description or picture); the descriptions are inconsistent, too brief and, in many cases, inadequate because there is no accompanying picture. Many of the color pictures have poor contrast and brightness making it difficult to see details in a logo or decal. The price values associated with nearly all the yo-yos in the book are way out of line with what collectors are currently willing to pay. In some cases, it is hundreds of dollars more! As a casual guide, it is fair. As a serious guide, it lacks depth, completeness, and consistency."
1,It was so cool! It showed everything! NOT! Ha Ha!,"This was a stupid book. It had the most errors you could ever get. My advice, don't get this book. I mean it!"
4,A great place to start.,"This book goes a long way on filling in the blanks for a new collector. It has brief histories of various manufacturers along with chronological order of yo-yos produced with photos. To my knowledge the ultimate guide doesn't exist, and this booklet is way ahead of anything else I've seen on yo-yo collecting."
5,an excellent read,"This novel is both literary and accessible, not something you can say about too many novels these days. I read the whole thing in about three days and then passed it on to a friend. And I'll be shocked if he doesn't love it as much as I did. I've never be to Mardi Gras or to New Orleans and I got such a good feel for the whole experience though this book. It really comes to life. I'd say the second half of the book is better than the first. About half way through the prose really takes off and you can see the author getting into his stride. I highly recommend it!!"
4,the Mardi Gras experience,"Not a whole lot plot wise, but it does get the feel of Mardi Gras real well, some great descriptions, the first scene of Bourbon street and the hook-up scene with the girl. I wasn't really bothered by the plot because the descriptions are vivid, and Mardi gras is that random. the writing style could be a more edited/polished in places. Overall pretty good & reads quickly."
3,"History of Camas Valley, Douglas County, Oregon","This is a book about the early history of Camas Valley, Douglas County, Oregon. It is soft bound, 82 pages with photos."
4,Chinese Tea,This chinese tea is great for preventing a cold or the flu. You drink it at the first signs of sniffle. And again the next day until you feel better. Great stuff.
5,BLM does not have some of the forms,I've worked for the BLM and I've read the book. We do not issue some of the forms in the book. I found the book informative and very enlighting for anyone not familiar with the program.
5,College Students View,"A few years ago I wrote a thesis on this law. What fascinated me the most was the amount of luxurious resorts, hotels and golf courses built on this property. Visit places like Pointe Hilton at Tapatio Cliffs Resort in the Phoenix area. It's beautiful. It was built on this free land. In fact, the World Golf Foundation is seeking this land to build more golf courses. NBC Nightly News called the this program, ""The Billion Dollar Giveaway Program."" If you can claim this free land in the path of city growth you may have something. Land speculators have made a fortune this way. Good Luck! The law and the book are 5 Star."
5,Could this be an alternative to reparations?,I read a pre-launch copy and this definately is a way to claim land. I've heard about this for years and now I know what the major companies know. Congratulations to the writer.
3,"Psychic Skills: Lessons in Clairvoyance, personal magnetism",I thought it was ok because I have read other books of this nature that I found to be better written.
4,Lafayette in Brooklyn,Good account by Walt Whitman of a short historical moment. Enjoyable for Lafayette-ophiles! Good glimpse of what was going on when Lafayette visited the US in 1824-1824 and the efforts that were made to honor him.
2,Very disappointed,I love Mary Stallings and have never been disppointed until now. I hate to give a bad review to anything of hers but I can't possibly say it is good. If you have trouble sleeping play this cd and you won't have any more problems. The album just drags and drags until you finally keep forwarding on to the next track. I have all of her cds and hope that the next will be a little more lively. Sorry Mary!
5,Nostalgic refresher for Viewer having watched show as a kid!,"Realy enjoyed watching show as a kid in the 1960's! It's especially nice treat to see the show IN COLOR!! When I was kid, we had Black & White TV -parents didn't get COLOR set until all the kids left home! Really enjoy seeing show again, but quickly realized is true what another reviewer has touched upon.. that MAJORITY of duration of show is filled up by time consuming, repetitive sequences shown over and over in each episode.. watch me pull a rabit out of my hat.. ect. I never noticed it as a child but now, as an adult, it has literally put me to sleep numerous times!! I've had to play episodes several times to try and stay awake! I suspect that back in the 1960's they couldn't afford to do all new animation each episode, so only the actual stories were new each time. But is nostalgic remenicing to see them again IN LIVING COLOR! Wish SONY would put out Season Four!! I have all three seasons and would snatch up Season Four!"
4,r & B season 2,"It's a shame they didn't use the original music during the credits. Jay Ward didn't own the rights to the music and the company putting out the DVD set didn't want to have to pay royalties for its use. Imagine seeing The Andy Griffith Show and not hearing the whistling theme song. It's also annoying that they used the opening credit segment that showed the name of the show as ROCKY & BULLWINKLE AND FRIENDS, when it was really ROCKY AND HIS FRIENDS. If you notice, when that segment plays, the voice is NOT that of William Conrad, but rather, someone who ""sounds"" like him. Other than these complaints about the opening and closing credits, the material on the set if great!"
5,Timeless humor,"My kids love these dvd's and the voices and writing are so well done and such fun that they didn't even notice that these are the cartoons of my generation.When you're wondering whether or not to take a chance on letting kids get too much ""exposure"" from more contemporary ""entertainment"" put one of these discs in and take a break from worrying about too much that's just too much and just laugh because this is stress-free funny."
3,Unclear Return Info,"My box set DVD arrived broken inside the primary packaging which I unforunately did not open until after presenting as a gift. The return info seemed handled well, but I only got return slip and no prepaid mailer with unclear instructions on where to ship. Paid for return shipping myself rather than dealing with call center in India again. Replacement did arrive quick though."
2,Rocky and Bullwinkle,"We originally thought this series might bring a nostalgia to us. While the stories and skits in these humorous tales of TV of yesteryear were more apt to be appreciated by grown ups, it does not do the same for a grown up who remembers fondly the years of our youth.I doubt kids today would understand much of the humor that these charactors presented.We gave them away and the youngsters who received them did not finish the series. So it goes......"
5,Bulwinkle & Friends,I always enjoyed these cartoons and was pleased to find them here. I'm sharing them with a younger generation who are having the fun that I had. Thank you for making them available. It is nice to watch from anywhere.
1,Show contents in the title are incorrect,"The contents of this episode are supposed to be:Rocky & Bullwinkle, ""Upsidasium"" Part 5, Fractured Fairy Tales ""King Midas"", Dudley Do-Right of theMounties ""Story 8"", Rocky & Bullwinkle, ""Upsidasium"" Part 6But are listed with the same contents as episode 1"
5,Rocky and Bullwinkle Season 2,This is just as much fun as I remembered from childhood. I ordered it when I discovered that my second grade students had never heard of Rocky and Bullwinkle. Now they can't wait for rainy or cold days to have inside recess and watch another episode. I would recommend this for children and for adults who enjoyed it as children.
5,"Wonderful, funny, touching insights apply to everyday life","This book of choice little chapters is funny, touching and applicable to the every day life of almost any woman. The book makes it easy to admit my faults and just as easy to see the grace that surrounds me."
3,Royal Rumble 2003,First match of the nightBrock Leasnar Vs. the 7 foot tall 500 pound big showAwesome opener brock belly to belly suplexed bigshow about 6 times and f-fived him for the 1-2-3 8.5/10MAtch 2 World tag titlesDudley boyz VS. william Reagal and LAnce StormShort and stupid should have been better3/10MAtch 3 Torri Wilson Vs.

Lots of blood and weapons. Funny when the lil M'fer Shannon moore helped MAtt Hardy stay in the matchOVer all not bad but could have been a better way to kick of the Road to Wrestlemania
2,royal rumble 2003,"one of the worst rumbles ever, hhh and steiner match was horrible, the rumble match totally sucked, the only good match was the awesome match of angle and beniot. would definly rent this if you havent seen it"
3,split both ways,"[...]BR>Before I even start on the wrestling, I must warn you that the sound quality is not good. Whoever [...] Sometimes the announcers' S's get fuzzy, and the tape absolutely butchers Kurt Angle's theme music. Also, the crowd seems curiously sedated.As for the matches:Big Show v. Brock Lesnar. This was the first match, and not long enough, either. The PPV started too quickly. Of course, Brock won.Dudley Boyz v. Lance Storm and William Regal. For the tag championship belts, no less. Dudleys won, but this match was merely okay.Dawn Marie v. Torrie Wilson. Oh my God. The storyline was awful and grossly unlikely. The match was worse. Get some actual wrestlers in women's matches, instead of porn stars and bimbos.Triple H v. Scott Steiner. For the WCW belt. This wasn't bad. It just wasn't good enough. Still, HHH was a bloody mess.Kurt Angle v. Chris Benoit. World Title. Awesome match.Rumble: average. I never knew they were this boring, though."
3,Angle vs Benoit one of the best matches of all time,Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoitit was anticapted rematch from uniforgiven where Chris Benoit wisely use da ropes 2 get da victory this time it wouldn't b that easy even though Kurt Angle had a messed up leg due 2 brock f5ing it through da ring post he stucked it up and delievered da best match of da year this match showcase these 2 at their very best da match had wrestling counter after counter some new moves and told a great story but what slightly suffered n this match was kurt angle reappling da chinlock was hurt da match for me but other than that this was slightly better match than their uniforgiven classic and almost as good as their tag team match together against rey and edge ****3/4
4,As predictible as 2002 Rumble,The 2003 Rumble emulated from boston. This was a great Pay Per View.1. Royal Rumble Qualyfying MatchBrock Lesnar vs The Big ShowSPOILER: Who ever wins this match wins the rumble. Desient Opener (3/4)2. World Tag Team Championship MatchThe Dudley Boyz vs. Regal/ Storm (c)Pretty good tag team championship match. Dudleys win with 3D. (3/4)3. Dawn Marie vs Torrie WilsonThe only cool about this match was the build up. NOT EVEN PAY PER VIEW GOOD. (0/4)4. World Heavyweight Championship MatchTriple H (c) vs Scott SteinerOK match. Just a power match. HHH retains with a DQ. (2/4)5. WWE Championship MatchKurt Angle (c) vs Chris BenoitThe Best match of all time. Benoit and Angle can go. Angle wins with an Ankle Lock. The Aftermath is just as great as the match. Nice try benoit. (5/4)2003 30-Man Royal Rumble MatchRoyal Rumbles are great but this one and last years were predictible. Lesner wins it by eliminating Undertaker. (4/4)Overall: Great pay per view to kick off 2003.
3,WWE ROYAL RUMBLE 2003,1.Brock Lesnar vs. Big Show- ok match winner went to rumble. Very predictible and a very predictible rumble. Great when Lesnar gave Big Show an F-5Winner- Brock Lesnar2.Dudley Boyz vs. Lance Storm and William Regal-not that good of a match. Gets boringWinners- Dudley Boyz3. Scott Stiener vs. Triple H- boring match. Triple H tried to leave and get dqed. He finally gets dqedWinner- Scott Stiener by dq4.Chris Beniot vs Kurt Angle- the best match of the year! Beniot headbutts Angle when Benoit is on the outherside of the ringWinner- Kurt Angle5.Royal Rumble- an ok rumble. Undertaker returns. Very predictible rumbleWinner- Brock Lesnar
3,Not a great Rumble but not unbearable!,"This one was a mixed bag. It had decent matches, one great match and one that was pretty bad.Brock Lesner Vs. The Big Show - Decent opener but definitely not as good as their encounter at Survivor Series 2002.The Dudley Boyz Vs. William Regal/Lance Storm (RAW World Tag Team Championship Match) - Not a bad match.Torrie Wilson Vs. Dawn Marie - Painful to watch! Mercifully short!Scott Steiner Vs. HHH (RAW World Heavyweight Championship) - This has to be one of the worst bouts ever! Neither are what they used to be! Plus, HHH said he went 30 minutes but I timed out that bout it was at least 18.Chris Benoit Vs. Kurt Angle (Smackdown World Heavyweight Championship) - This match saves the card right here! It was a WAR!The Royal Rumble Match - Wasn't a great Rumble but didn't suck either. Watchable.Overall, not bad but wouldn't recommend it unless you just like to collect the cards like I do."
3,A decent rumble,I think the only match that brought this rumble down was the match between Triple H and Scott Steiner. It was almost as if triple H didn't try and I really dislike Scott Steiner. I only gave this DVD three stars because of this match if they omitted it I would have definitely gave it four. The rumble match was bloody awesome and the other matches were all fairly cool.
1,"Dull, Boring, and yet another Triple H stinkfest","The Rumble event was one of the worst ppv's of the past year. Triple H Vs Scott Steiner was the worst world title match ever, surpassing Triple H Vs Undertaker from KOR 2002. Steiner is finished and Triple H is still boring and dull. Kurt Angle vs Chris Benoit is a 5 star match, but of course Triple H gets better billing on the card. Go Figure. The Rumble match itself was predictable, with Lesner winning. Complete garbage. The WWE needs to put the axe on the Triple H show and give it to someone who is actually OVER, like Booker T. or RVD. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
2,Honest review from someone who was there...,"The Royal Rumble was a very disappointing show. The Rumble itself wasn't all that great, and all of the matches sucked except Angle vs. Benoit, which is HIGHLY OVERRATED. Sloppy execution by Kurt, Kurt calling spots out loud in the ring, Kurt's disregard for selling, among other things. I loved this match when I was there, it saved the show from being a complete disaster, but every time I go back and watch it, I notice how terribly flawed and overrated it is.Big Show vs. Brock Lesnar: **2/4Storm & Regal vs. The Dudley Boyz- To be honest, I have to watch this again, I don't remember much about it.)Torrie Wilson vs. Dawn Marie - 0- The storyline is just as bad as the pathetic match. The audience was asleep.Triple H vs. Scott Steiner - *- Horrible match. Just goes to show how overrated a worker HHH is.Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle - ***2/4Royal Rumble Match - ***"

5,My Favorite New Age CD,"This is probably the best compilation of new age artists I have ever listened to. You won't find any of that boring, heavy on the synthesizer, ""mood"" music here. Every song is a treat to the ears from James Newton Howard's Plymouth Waltz to Susan Ciani's Neverland. This CD is hard to find - so grab it if you can."
5,PRIVATE MUSIC COMES OF AGE...,"This album was actually the third ""Sampler"" released by Private Music, one of the earliest ""New Age"" labels (their earlier samplers are:The World of Private Music, Vol. 1andThe World of Private Music, Vol. 2), and it is exceptional in every regard.Their two ""signature"" artists are well-represented: Yanni (with ""Swept Away,"" ""Keys to Imagination,"" and ""Within Attraction"") and Patrick O'Hearn (""Reunion"" and ""Forever the Optimist""), but they have now added Tangerine Dream (two tracks), a young pianist named Suzanne Ciani, Michael Colina (two tracks), and even John Tesh (BEFORE he became a TV star and ""Contemporary Christian Music"" composer, thankfully). There is even (heresy of heresies for a ""New Age"" album!) a VOCAL song by Bill Gable, ""High Trapeze.""This is a GREAT, upbeat collection!"
3,TOO BRIGHT!,"Hi, Even though this clock has to settings for the brightness of the numbers, they are just so big they give off enough light that it fills the room. You can read by the light that this clock gives off! If you like to have it dark when you sleep- don't get this clock. The clock has never failed in many power outs, and always wakes me up on time but make sure you are ok for the light it will give off."
3,Volume problems with radio/alarm,"The clock is great. I bought it for the dual alarm feature as well as the easy to read numerals. The problem I have had is using the snooze alarm... The problem is that the volume control for the radio is too close to the snooze button, so while hitting the snooze button, I turn the radio volume off. Now I have to use the second alarm with a loud buzzer instead of the radio. Of course, I could stop using the snooze alarm, but that's what it's there for. I wouldn't buy it again unless they moved the volume control to the side out of the way of my grasp."
5,Had one before,I had the same model before I never thought I would be able to replace it I love the dual alarm
5,Enjoyable DVD,"This is a unique DVD of a carnatic concert (South Indian concert). We watched the movie in a theater and subsequently purchased the DVD. It is a treasure and collection. The quality is amazing, and a bit non tradition in visual presentation. The music itself is purely traditional. Highly recommended to carnatic music rasikas (people who enjoy carnatic music) and to people interested to learn/get to know South Indian carnatic classical music."
4,Anger management,This is a wonderful guide for managing anger for children and adults. It teaches healthy ways to deal with anger. Parents and children should read and follow the advice.
3,Age appropriate,"I preread this book before sharing it with my 8 year old granddaughter. Much of it was useful but it seems the age range was too broad as I felt the things mentioned were inappropriate for a child this young. It would have been better if the book stuck with an 8-12 range and then a teenage version. As it is, the cover seems to be for younger children while the mention of drugs and school work is for older. I wasn't comfortable letting her read it herself, which was too bad."
5,Good practical book,"I bought this book because I'm getting ready to teach 5th graders, but I have a 5 year old at home and began reading it to him when I received it. He loves for me to read it aloud to him. It is a really practical book for children. It gives them lots of real life situations to evaluate."
5,Great,Great tool for kids to learn to deal with theses issues at school and at home. Glad that I came across it
3,Could have worked,I read a few things that seemed helpful but my daughter got angry and ripped the book up so it didn't help her!
2,It's a cute book . . .,"This is a very cute book, but to find the time and place to sit down with an angry kid hasn't come about just yet, it's one of those that I'll have to read and then take the ideas to the kids.Definitely a book I'd suggest though . . . I just haven't gotten a chance to use it the way I'd like yet!"
3,"Book for parents, and kids over age 10","As I went through this book, I felt that the information given required a fairly high level of self-awareness and reading skill to benefit from it. An excellent resource for a parent or teacher, I feel the younger child (10 years and younger) would retain information most from having an adult read portions to them. It would be helpful if it related to the immediate problem the child is having, or is interested in. The book doesn't seem to lend itself to a read from cover to cover, but would be better read and/or discussed in segments, even for the older child. I really like the content, but was looking for a book for younger children."
1,Mo Hotta Mo Betta,"Mo Hotta Mo Betta is a company you cannot count on. I will soon be receiving my Christmas present (one month late????) The company was out of stock and could not meet the order. They must be hard up for money, because after being told to cancel the order, they still sent it and charged the credit card even though being contacted by e-mail and telephone! Mo hotta Mo Betta= Mo Money=Po Customer Service.Why would anyone want to do business with a company like Mo Hotta Mo Betta?"
3,A bit out of date,"Changing countries is always a memory challenge. Lots of new impressions combined with a new language, or just words that are unfamiliar. Moving to the US from Stockholm, i was surprised by my inability to remember people names, especially those I had not heard before. So I decided to do something about it.The memory book includes all of the tyoical tricks such as visualization and linking. And it works. To my understanding the book is one of the classics on Memory, but in my opinion classic is not always better. The book is written in an old language, and is not optimized for quick learning. It goes on and on about things that are pretty self explanatory. Next time I'll pick up something newer, that draws on the wisdom in this book and others, but presents it in a fun and readable manner.Not a waste, but not a winner."
2,Way Too Much Work,"I only found the first section of this book helpful; the part on association. I'm not saying that the rest of it wouldn't work. I am saying that it would be a Whole Lot of Work; more work than I want to put into remembering things. I also think that to use the systems in this book you have to be a very creative person. Even the first section on association requires a lot of creative thinking. I would have to come up with a creative, outlandish mental picture for every single thing I'm trying to remember. A Lot of Work. So, maybe these systems work, but you need to be prepared to work very hard at them."
3,nothing great,I figured I would try some memory books read several and nothing I would recomend. Some descent techniques but nothing great and life changing.
2,Less than I had hoped for.,"This book is 20 pages application, and the rest is a dialogue that doesn't have much bearing on improving memory; complete waste of money if you ask me."
3,Useful Memory Improvement Tools,The memory improvements technics in the book work - all you need is enough motivation to train yourself to use them.
3,Not bad,"After reading a couple of chapters, I was readily able to remember reasonable lists of items for our shopping trips better than my wife! ;-) However, upon reading more, I realized that the whole book could be summarized in just a few statements: To remember, you need to make the effort to remember. To help in that endeavor, associate each item with something you find easier to remember (example: the name Tony could be remembered as the guy with a toe sticking out of his knee). The book also uses sound associations for numbers in order to remember the specific order of things. With those two techniques applied to every situation, you can remember. But part of the key is - you made an honest attempt to remember it in the first place instead of just glazing over and hoping for the best. Not particularly ground breaking information! However, it did help me to some extent, so I still give it a 3 (as in ""okay"")."
4,memories,"Let me break it down. For it's price, this book is quite the value. However, like many have said, you cannot simply read it cover to cover and develop a great memory. You have to implement the techniques. Even 15 minutes a day will slowly help you to master the basic techniques here. The next step once you have the techniques down is to use some common sense and creativity to apply them in real life, practical situations (not just memorize 50 digit numbers). In the 3 weeks that I've had the book, I've noticed significant improvements in my memory with (a) names (b) shopping lists (c) directions (d) to do lists (e) numbers. I can also impress people by looking at a 50 digit number for 5 minutes and reciting it backwards and forwards. Buy the book but only if you're willing to put in some time and learn the techniques and then apply them in a practical way. If anything, the party tricks you'll learn may improve your love life. Just don't forget the girls' name."
4,Good little guide!,"It does what it says it does. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their memory. I've a grouse though, some of the concepts gets too technical at times and makes me go 'huh?' but all in all an excellent memory guide book!"
5,I was skeptical but the system worked!,"I needed to improve my memory and after taking a ""peek inside"" decided to give this book a try. I don't regret it. I will recommend it to all my friends."
5,Get This Book!,"The memory techniques taught in this book are tantamount to taking crib notes into an exam. They are, in fact, easier than writing things down. That goes for numbers, dates, events, lists and on and on.You WILL amaze yourself. You WILL be able to quickly look through a deck of playing cards and immediately name the missing cards, you WILL be able to remember large numbers after hearing or reading them once, you WILL be able to remember lists of large numbers. You WILL be able to recall every scene in a movie or series of events in real life in precise chronological order.The great thing about this book is that it blows you away with your own abilities. It's a 'self-help' book in the truest sense. You WILL feel better about yourself."
5,Kudo's from a lousy memory,"I have a terrible memory. Can't remember names or directions. After only reading chapter one, I went out to a Monday Night Football party and left remembering the first and last names of all 8 people I met. It was great to be able to call someone by their name instead of ""hey pal"". I descibed the methods to my wife (Using the ""keyword"" & ""linking"" concepts I can go through the book chapter by chapter from memory) she thinks they sound hokey. But it's been the best $10 I ever spent."
5,Fun,"I kept an A average in Arabic, in college, in an 8 credit hour class to 5th year language level, throughout. I worked full time and did college full time. I memorized my notes and notes from readings before midterms and finals, and had a 3.5 in my last 2 years at the University of Michigan. The ""meat"" of this book is about 20 pages long, the rest is application. I learned the method in an all-nighter in which I also caught up from being 4 units behind.I was really glad to have found this book, and would not have made it through college without it."
5,Fun and easy to follow,Great book! I was able to apply the steps for a better memory skills. I was a little skeptical that I would be able to learn the system but I did. Easy to undertand and put to use in every day life.
3,Alright,Didn't really help with studying as much as I hoped it might and many of the examples in the books aren't so much helpful in everyday life as they are just publicity stunts and him attempting to impress people with an ability that is certainly impressive but fails to really apply itself in most people's everyday life.
5,Memory Book,"This was purchased for someone other than myself, and they seem well pleased with the book."
3,Good content very bad printing quality,It looks like an old hardcopy riprinted. The book has value per se but it looks and is very cheap (pages not cover)
1,This book is not reader friedly. It is also dated.,This books does not cover any topic in enough deapth. It sounds almost silly at times. 75% of the text is fluff. A huge waste of time. Don't buy it.
4,Good,"This is a good book not just for students but for everyone wishing to improve.In the short time that I have had this book, I have been able to memorize a few hundred names, no problem. What I will say that after you memorize whatever you have memorized, you need to apply it in any way you can. For instance, In about 10 minutes, I memorized the definitions for 20 difficult voabulary words, and revised them over the next two days. A few days later I quizzed myself on them and surprisingly, I still remembered all of them!To anyone who wants to have a great memory, this is a great book!"
5,Great Book!!,"One of the best memory books around, will definitely help you with memory IF YOU PRACTICE!! If you practice the methods continously, make distinctions every time you use it, and improve everytime you use it, you will be able to memorize almost anything."
5,A great starting place!,"This is a great book for a newbie - if you have not yet started, but want to - then this is a good starting place. If you don't achieve what you want in the first 90 days, give it 6 months to try again. It is very basic which is what some people need.Another book that worked for me faster, and gave me very good results was this one: (both are great though) :How To You Can Develop A Perfect Memory: Never Forget Again!"
5,The Memory book,"I found this book extremely helpful, I previously owned a copy of this book, but the person I loaned it to didn't have the ability to remember to return it to me"
5,"BUY THIS NOW, Your life will never be the same!","If you want to make school a piece of cake, you must own this book. If it is numbers, lists, formula, foreign language, or hooking a name to a face, this book has it all. Get this for your kids, your spouse and yourself. If you use just some of the techniques, it will change your LIFE. The boring old junk you had to memorize now becomes a game. I used this book to teach my 8 year old all the counties in Arizona including the county seats in less than 30 minutes. This, and the speed reading course, makes school a breeze. BUY IT NOW."
4,Great memory techniques -- could use minor improvements,"This classic by Lorayne and Lucas is worthy of recommendation to any new student of memory systems. I do, however, wish that the authors had covered the power of the Loci system with greater detail. It is utilized by world-class memorizers to set new records in memory competitions. And the system I employed to set a new U.S. record in card memorization cannot even be found in this book. All the other memory systems and techniques explained by Lorayne and Lucas are excellent. In my opinion, as long as this book is not the only memory guide in your library, it will serve you very well."
5,What a great book!!!,"You have probably discovered that a great memory is essential in freetime, education and work. Almost everything we do depending on our memory. Most of us belive that memory is inborn. But ,as true as it is , with some easy trick you can promote a rapid improvement. Harry Loaryne , who is fameous memory expert and author of this book, explain have to remember phonenumbers, long digits numbers, facts, speeches, foreign words, faces, names and how to read faster with better comprehension. A perfect memory is the main key to knowledge and learnig, which results in top grades and good jobs. If you want to become a straight A student, this book will help you to achive that goal. This book is highly recomeneded!!! Buy it immediately!!!"
4,Klassic Kottke,"Fans tend to give Kottke's Private Music years little attention, instead focusing on his his lone Takoma and subsequent Capitol releases. Those who do this, miss out on some wonderful guitar playing. Regards from Chuck Pink features some of Kottke's unique style of finger-picking. And while this is an all-instrumental affair, Kottke works with other musicians on many tracks, including George Doering on electric guitar (""The Late Zone"" and ""Busy Signal""), Brenton Banks on violin (""I Yell at Traffic"") and even electronic woodwind provided by Marty Krystall on ""Foster's Feet."" Kottke also includes an understated solo reworking of ""Ojo"" from Six-and-12-String Guitar. Overall, fans of Kottke's guitar work will find much to enjoy here. RECOMMENDED"
4,Wave tools for the wanderers.,"I love this movie for its simplicity and use of multiple approaches to riding waves. The opening section of Dan Malloy, Belen and Alex Knost surfing in India is unique. Liked the section of log riding with the ladies. Grace and flow. Mike and Mike is a fun one. Overall the movie keeps you in the flow, but then Thomas talks a little too much in some sections. He is no Bruce Brown. I think he tries to hard. Give up the mic and just shoot."
2,dump the politics and racial bias,"This movie was really looking better than the seedling, he wasnt trying as hard to be college artsy and seemed to be sticking to entire ride surfing and music and less tortuously unfunny comedy bits but then he has to insert some lame out dated blame whitey crap and ruin the feel of the movie. Maybe hes forgotten that yes whitey did conquer the Americas but we also lived thru our own conquests from Attila, Ghengas Kahn and numerous Muslim invasions and brutal occupations that lasted for centuries. Everybodys killed everybody else get over it. Quit dragging personal divisive politics into a freakin surf movie. Although the surfing is good, especially the fish section and its got Skip Frye in it I wish hadnt given Thomas a dime of my money now.As with Seedling get your fast fwd button ready."
5,good book about electromagnetic scattering,"This book is very good about theoretical approach to electromagnetic scattering for graduate students. Topics are clearly expressed and easy to follow. Some of the applications such as interferometric SAR, radar polarimetry, RCS, Remute Sensing are examinated."
2,How To Relic A Guitar,"The DVD is not what I expected, having gone through Fender's Custom Shop in California, I expected to see genuine looking 'reliced' guitars and a professional approach to the 'craft' of artificially aging a guitar. Buy a book instead."
3,very very very small,"This knife is good quality and true Swiss Army, but it is fingernail clipper size. seriously, about 2 inches long!"
4,Good for students,"This book is great for advertising students who have not yet lost their way. It will keep me on the yellow brick road throughout my career - as soon as I can keep my fellow ad students from passing it around so I can have it back! But, it is repetitive in a creative way."
2,Nice historical musings mingled with good ad concepts,"There's nothing really new or earth-shattering in this book that doesn't exist in many other good marketing or sales books. However, it is a nice refresher on both how to write effective ads and run an efficient business. The historical notes make it interesting and the shortness of each ""essay"" make it easy to read. Unlike a good ad though, it covers too many thoughts without hitting one deeply enough to make a lasting impression. It is definitely just a ""collection of short essays"" as described by the publisher and should be regarded as such."
1,"Like Chicken Soup, It Couldn't Hurt","Good luck if you think this is your answer to advertising and marketing failures. It isn't. It's another two hundred odd pages of repetition and feel-good platitudes, but no real substance. Yes, it's impoprtant to have ad copy that is different and creative and well written. That's the message of the book. It doesn't say where you get the geniuses to write this copy time after time, but then you discover that, lo and behold, Mr. Williams has a consulting company that can help! A more cynical person might think this book is nothing more then a fluff piece designed to sell the services of the auther and not much else. The fact that it stresses ""good"" ad copy and nothing about how to schedule the copy in the various media makes this book as incomplete as a skydiving manual with no directions on how to pack the chute. There are far more informative books on the subject. This one was a slick looking disappointment. Big hat, no cattle."
4,Into Utopia?,"I'm rereading this book for the second time. Not that it's impossible to comprehend, but I'm a bit wary of making the leap. The book makes it sound easy, but what book doesn't?My hairdresser suggested I get it and Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired. According to her, her business is growing by leaps and bounds.Nonetheless, I remain unconvinced. My husband thinks ""now is the time."" I told him to tell it to Ford's Edsel people.Still, in a sense of fairness, I would recommend Williams' book to those who are determined to own their own business. I wish them luck."
4,Insightful and Thought Provoking,I am a advertising major in college and my professor chose this book as the required text. I found the book to be insightful adn thought provoking. You are required to think on different levels and it challenges your mindset. I enjoy the book immensely and all of the questions it raises. Although it does not pertain to advertising strategies it does make you look at advertising in a light that you my not have discovered on your own.
1,Utter Drivel,"This little tome is a ridiculous, self-congratulatory piece of puffery that may convince two-bit ma and pa businesses across America that they too can think like big ad execs. Bottom line, though, they can't. This book can't teach them how either. It may distract from the initial sense of ill-preparedness small business owners feel when preparing to delve into advertising, but ultimately nothing lies beyond the curtain... Wizard of Oz, anyone?"
3,Broadcast Media isn't always the best advertising medium.,"A very insightful book on advertising. However, I am surprised that Mr. Williams bothered to put it in print since he apparently believes the only way to advertise is through broadcast or intrusive media (radio and television). Intrusive media is just that. That is why consumers often turn the station on their radio and televisions when the programming they are listening to or watching is interupted by advertising. Print advertising is non-intrusive and therefore looked upon by choice by the consumer. An effective advertising campaign can be accomplished by many different mediums and most often with a mix of more than one."
1,Next to useless,"The pages are pretty. The type is big. The design is cheesy. You can read it in a day. But you'll wish you hadn't, as the book offers very little in the way of useful advice. Buy Ogilvy. Or Caples. Or Crompton. Just stay away from the tired old wizard."
4,Review on the 2004 edition of this book (Longman - Pearson),"As introduced, it provides a complete survey of the English prose, poetry and drama of the US from Colonial times to the 1980s (glossary of literary terms and a table of historical and literary events also included).You're gonna learn about some major writers and their most famous works.This book does give us a clear overview of the American Literature, but as the name has said, it is just an outline. I think it will be most helpful to those who have just started studying American Lit, or have not taken it as a major in college, or are international students like I.Briefly, ""An Outline of American Literature"" of Peter B.High is one of the most helpful, informative and interesting-to-read reference books."
3,Like Video Game,"CLEMENCY POGUE: FAIRY KILLER BY J.T. PETTY, ILLUSTRATED BY WILL DAVIS is a new Tween-age young adult series that I found to be a bit violent and would be frightening to many children. It is about fairies who are like annoying or evil bugs and the child hero kills them by remembering the magic phrase from Peter Pan. The series surely appeals to pre-teens who enjoy combative video games and will find the young Clemency Pogue quite funny. Besides penning children's fiction (three novels to date), JT Petty is a highly-successful video games writer, Hollywood screenwriter and independent filmmaker. And he's only 29 years old! The Clemency Pogue series was recently acquired by The Jim Henson Company, with whom Petty is working closely to adapt the story to the big screen as an animated motion picture."
2,Non-Working Eraser,"These pencil have some nice lead. The lead is thick, and hard, but not too hard. The pencil sharpens easily. These are things thst earn this pencil 2 stars.The eraser doesn't work! How on Earth can you work without and eraser? It just makes a bunch of smudges, making the eraser lead itself.Paper-Mate makes other great pencils. So don't buy these. I think they already discontinued them due to the poor eraser."
1,Hunk of crap,"Thing didn't even work out of the box. I have to hold the transmitter right next to the receiver to get it to register. When I do get it registered (typically after ~10 tries) it has about a range of 2"". Awesome."
4,Good Read,"Mr. Yoho is a well-known and compelling public speaker. He tends to capture his audience with not only the content of what he is saying but how he says it. I found this book to also be a compelling read. Many of the stories and ideas will be familiar to those who have heard him speak. They do not wear with the retelling. In one interesting section of the book, Chapter 10, the author describes the attributes of a good speech. Mr. Yoho relates the Greek understanding of what is required for a compelling presentation: ethos, logos and pathos. This is only one example of the many thought provoking and helpful ideas in this book."
4,CRITIQUE,"Perhaps it may be well to understand that this book addresses a myriad of situations and sales approaches as well as tecnniques, to make those involved with sales, to develop their skills. While there are a number of ways to develop these skills, all people involved with sales would be wise to read the contents with emphasis towards picking out one or two theories brought forth (in the book) to practice over a specific period of time, and then evaluate the benefits derived. Dave Yoho is not only a good sales teacher, but he is an excellent salesman himself. Read the book and make your own judgement."
5,Love It! Great Energy!,"I do a lot of fitness DVD's and I recently purchased this one and right away, I know it's going to be one of my favorites. It targets the whole body and incorporates cardio and toning so you get everything you need in one workout. Cindy Whitmarsh has tons of energy and is motivating, easy to follow and the time flies by. I recommend this program to anyone!!"
1,Not Challenging Enough,"I love Cindy Whitmarsh's workouts from Exercise TV, but this DVD just wasn't challenging at all. I did all of the segments together and didn't break a sweat."
3,Good For Beginner,"This wasn't the ""Bootcamp"" I expected it to be. Wasn't fast paced enough or hard hitting enough for me but it would probably be a good starter workout for someone else."
4,Good Filter Element,"I have used this Pentek P25 filter element ahead of my Kinetico water softner for several years now. The softner relies on sediment free water, as the timer mechanism is purely hydraulic. I have not had a malfunction of the softener due to sediment contamination. This element seems to do the job."
3,If only I had read the rest of the book,I got about 75 -100 pages into the book and lost interest. I have yet to read the rest. It just seemed that all of the steam had run out of the book. I loved the start... but I just could not get in to the story.
3,poorly made,This needs to have more Velcro for the neck it doesn't fit the neck and my daughter just rips it off because it's a really small strip of Velcro. I don't end up using it.
5,One of my fav childhood books,"I bought 3 of these for my siblings for Christmas. Just opening it up and looking at the book brought back so many memories! I don't think my siblings remembered it as well as I did, I should have grabbed one of them back for my personal collection, they weren't terribly impressed. Oh well, I liked the illustrations and the content!"
3,Cute but there is no explanation,"I liked the idea of a book that explained what the sayings meant, but all it had was a literal illustration of the saying. The illustrations are cute, but all they do is reinforce the misunderstanding."
2,Functional more than beautiful,"My husband wanted glass mugs so he could make layered coffee drinks (new espresso machine toy!) I didn't want to buy anything too expensive so I got these. They're perfectly serviceable and a good price but their appearance leaves something to be desired. You can see the seams where the two halves of glass are 'glued' together and there is a lot of rippling throughout the glass so they aren't terribly clear. They're fine for husband's needs, but I won't use them for company."
5,Cheerful service w/mini bonsai,"I'm very pleased with both the service and the mini bonsai plant(into the second week already).The service was flawless: rapid delivery; very well packaged (large box, w/much foam and bubble wrap insulation); instructions were easy to follow & I was especially fond of the attractive business card that re-printed a summary of the plant care instructions; also packed was a story about the origin of miniature bonsai along with a packet of granulized fertilizer and foldable trimming scissors(!)The plant was in fine shape--moist soil, leaves intact on the branches & green, with moss and other vegetation covering the mound of soil. (In fact I ordered separately from the seller a glass lantern display case & the plant inside the glass lantern is quite a sight, drawing complements from people:)"
5,Useful and compact,"I got this from the library and had to add it to my gardening collection. It's compact, but has lots of useful information, from rose care to good ideas on how to select and use particular rose varieties and a big photo section showing favorite roses. I've had a lot of fun looking at it again and again. If you only want one rose book, I don't think you could go wrong with this one. If you already have lots, like me, you'll still find this useful and enjoyable!"
2,"Helpful information, but the book falls apart","I received this book a couple of days ago from Amazon, and while the information and photographs are helpful, the pages are falling out. It's a paperback and it just seems to be pretty shoddily put together. Kind of a hassle to have to return it especially since I live in Europe."
5,Simply counterbalancing a ridiculous review,"I will return to do a proper review of this book ASAP. In the meantime, though, I find it profoundly unfair that a book that is *for juvenile readers* received a rating of 1 star simply because the reviewer was looking for comprehensive titles for adults and was not paying attention to categories. Therefore, for the moment, I've given it 5 stars so that it will have a 3-star rating and be considered by people who are seeking what this book clearly is -- a young person's informational book about Nicaragua."
1,Written for Younger Readers,"This book was written more for adolescent readers than adults. If you are truly interested in quality books about Nicaragua, then do not purchase this particular edition."
2,"Unfairly biased, and more readable than informative","Hunt tries to do a good job in making the subject matter interesting, but in doing so he devotes so much space to anecdotes that he leaves out a lot of more pertinent information. Also, he does not give a neutral history of psychology, but instead displays empirical biases and a bias of psychology as a science throughout the book, writing at more length about philosophers and psychologists who agree with him and dismissing, ridiculing, and understating those who do not. For a non-biased history of the philosophical roots of psychology, try Robert MacLeod's Persistant Problems of Psychology. Unfortunately, though, that book only has the philosophic background of psychology and does not enter into the history of psychology in the 20th century."
3,Good Info but Not Complete,"I enjoyed reading this book, it, as one review points out, was not perfect. I found it easy to understand as far as how it was said, BUT could not understand certain parts such as what occurred in certain experiments because there were no pictures to demonstrate what he was talking about. I also found that he missed certain very relevant parts of the history of psychology, mainly, it's dark side, which you can learn about in one of my books once I get it published."
5,"Good Product, Good Service",I am very pleased with both the quality of this product (used book) and service I received from this vendor. Well done and thank you very much!
5,Personalizes Psychology to an enjoyable end,"One word separates this book from a regular Psychology text -- context. If most psychologists conduct research into things that are 'close to home,' then it's that very context that sheds light into why we even have the study of Psychology to begin with. A definite once-read-through for all students of the human mind."
4,Great Gym Bag,"This is a great bag to use for the gym. I go right after I get off work, so I need to carry my lunch and everything else that I typically need during my work day, plus my work out clothes. It is big enough to do all that! The shoe compartments are more than big enough to hold my size 12 men's shoes. And the mesh pocket on the outside that is supposed to hold the soccer ball is a good place to hold anything that you need to put in quickly. Great bag!"
3,Yanni mix,"This album has a little of past and present,since I have other CDs this was decent but not all new material.."
3,"Some good info, but annoying","After I read this, I was left with a pretty sour taste. A lot of the book is taken up with ""See how rich and extravagant we were, and now we're on the YMML program and see how wonderful we are"", definitely not the kind of story I want to read if I'm stuck in debt trying to get out."
4,"Flexibility within the application of ""Your Money or Life""","This books provided good summaries of how people may tailor the ""Your Money or Your Life"" program to different circumstances. It was highly beneficial by emphasizing the need for flexibility in applying the program's tenets and identifying ""lessons learned"" from the authors' own experiences. It was also nice to see another viewpoint which substantiated the viability of achieving financial independence and its personal rewards."
2,Get your life elsewhere !!!,"This book is a far way from helpful. The authors have done an O.K. job in transformming their lives. But they seemed to have trouble giving the reader some ideas on how to achive it. They gave about a dozen examples of how people achive ""F.I."", but no new ideas.(we've read this before when it was titled ""Your Money or Your Life)Anyone who has read ""YM or Y L"" should consider themselves done with the subject. Blix and Heitmiller give off some sort of cockyness about the lives they lead. Maybe someday we will all get there.Thanks for listening."
4,Eye Opener,"Woods' book is an eye-opener, especially his discussion of the United States Constitution. We have been told over and over that the Constitution was really a Christian document whose aims and purposes had been corrupted by the liberal leadership throughout our history. Woods, however, shows that in spite of the Godly basis of many U.S. state constitutions, the federal document is terribly flawed and based upon an improper authority: the people and not God.He is unashamed in calling for a government built upon the principles of the Bible.The key weakness comes in the later chapters. His call for action is little more than a listing of campaign techniques that any political junkie is well aware of. Otherwise, it is a fine volume."
2,Disappointing,"I had expected more from this product. All it is are single page maps of cities in Kalamar and the Young Kingdoms with no labels, references, and little distinction between them. All in all, hopelessly generic and of little use."
4,Very nice,"Very sweet book. Family oriented. Lovely, and big words to see, but easy story to understand."
2,nothing exceptional about this book,"The gist of the story is that baby owl must wait and wait and wait. His mother tells him he just has to wait. We know not for what until the end. He is waiting to take his first flight. When he finally gets to fly he loves it and enjoys the sites.Charming illustrations in chalk pastel. Owls are very cutesy looking (cartoon-ish) with very large eyes (versus a more accurate portrayal of what they really look like).There is just nothing special about this book. I find it boring. Unless you have a special affection for owls or want to read to your child about how sometimes we must wait to do something we want, I recommend skipping this book. While the content is innocent, friendly, no violence or negative comment, I just can't see any reason why I should rate this higher than 2 stars."
5,Excellent Representative of Genre of Civil War Regimental Histories,"This volume of regimental histories of Georgia units in the Civil War is a gem. James Madison Folsom traveled to Virginia near the end of the war and worked directly with the regimental leaders of the units included to compile these histories, along with statistics (e.g., number of men enlisted, killed, wounded, etc.). Civil War history buffs will enjoy reading the histories. Family historians will be especially interested in the histories. My great-great grandfather was a member of the 6th Georgia Volunteer Infantry, and its regimental history is 11 pages in length. Heroes and Martyrs of Georgia provides the most complete source of information about the 6th Georgia regiment that I have been able to find."
4,Optical Race,"The 4 ""Melrose Years"" albums (Optical Race, Miracle Mile, Lily On The Beach and Melrose) were missing from my collection of TD so at this low price, I decided to add this to the rest. This isn't my favorite era of the band but there are tracks on each of the 4 albums that are worth having. Tangerine Dream evolved over the years from a cutting edge Berlin School electronic rock band with music written as a group to more of a rock fusion period to a dreadful smooth jazz period with Kenny G type saxophone parts to pretty much just Edgar Froese writing all the music and the present band performing it. They still have their moments and their live shows are still worth seeing but I no longer look forward excitedly to their next release as I once did."
3,It is not bad,"The book is very wordy, and it is not easy to read. Sometimes it jumps from one point to another. There are also times where it overgeneralizes several aspects of its discussions and lacks specific evidence. Other than that, some of the middle chapters better written and more specific, thus, easier to read."
2,It's a big help in the 8th grade classroom,As an 8th gr teacher we don't want to spend hours teching grammar the old way boring the students. This book is wonderful because they are interested in the stories. This interest also allows them to truly understand the concept of grammar and punctuation.
2,Don't like for several reasons,"I really disliked this book for several reasons:- It's a really complicated and disorganized way to explain a good idea (give kids an ongoing story with grammar mistakes and let them correct it).- That's all the book is: a concept. It's not a turnkey solution in itself like every other book I've ordered in this genre. All of the work of making up the story is left up to the reader.- It's really poorly written with some questionable grammer, including the title. Why is there an apostrophe in Caught 'ya? The author loses credibility with that one.Gave it two stars because of the listing of common grammar mistakes from her experience. All in all, not a good purchase - disappointing."
1,Waste of money,"As a homeschooling mother, I was looking for something fun for my daughter to do. I found this book to be a waste of money and incredibly simplistic. About 95% of the book was unnecessary - an outline of the procedure and the actual story would have sufficed. I feel really ripped off. This is how they teach grammar in school? A sentence a day? No wonder many kids can't read, write or spell. Unfortunately I can't get my money back!"
2,Overly complicated...,"I tried reading the introduction to this book and got bogged down in all the details. I couldn't figure out the program. Too confusing! Also, you have to make up your own stories. I'd rather have a book with everything ready to go for classroom use."
1,Not Positive for Character Education,"Although the concept is a good one, I swept this book under rug. As an English teacher, I am always willing to find fun activities to peak my student's learning, but I refuse to use stories that sound disrespectful toward teachers and students. My job is to teach respect for peers and to build character while teaching the beauty of Engish, but this book offers neither."
2,"Ambivalent novel long on poetry, short on solutions","Tedious novel in the form of nine linked stories shows Mexican life from multiple angles, none too flattering. The crystal frontier of the title is, of course, the U.S.-Mexican border; what matters here is less the border as geopolitical fact and more its impact on the Mexican psyche. The author aims his barbs at both sides of the border; there's little surprising here except perhaps for the portrayal of a disdainful Mexican upper class that couldn't care less about how the other half lives or whether it lives or starves. Book clubs will find this a useful tool for stirring up discussion on the illegal drug and immigration issues whether they read through to the end or not; those who do will be rewarded with a chapter written half in normal prose and half in surreal fragmentary lines of poetry, the effect of which is not unlike sitting through a Tarkovsky double-feature."
3,good for the price,"This is a good quality pan for the price. Nice large size,thick bottom, cleans easy, and no Teflon to worry about scratching off. The only thing I am concerned about is, the handle flexes a lot even when your handling the pan empty.The long handle is poorly made. I think that will be the eventual reason the pan goes in the garbage."
2,Incomplete Set,"We were very disappointed in this item, which is listed as a CD with Book. There was no CD, so the book that did arrive was useless."
4,"More than 20 years later, I remember this book and still tear up","I read this book when I was a preteen and I can vividly remembering crying my eyes out for at least an hour. The story is well told and touching without being overly sentimental. The relationship between the sisters is realistic and, when tragedy strike, heartbreaking. A wonderful book -- it really should be back in print!"
4,"It was sad, but I loved it","It was a great book, I think it read the entire book in at least three sittings. It was great, and all I wasnted to do was read it, and then when I got down I was sad!!! I cried over the death of the girl, wouldn't anyone, it's just so sad. The only thing that disappointed me was that I wish it would've been longer, and went on to tell how the sister delt with the death in later years, other that that...perfect.----13-yr-old from WI"
3,Nice features- has some problems,"I have a 256 iiver and had a 512 iriver mp3 player. The 256 unit has been reliable. I liked it so much that I bought a 512 unit. I have had to return it twice because it works great for a while, then it simply won't turn on. Dead, Dead, Dead and no resurection. It may be a problem particular to this unit. I hope they get it fixed because they have a good, easy to use product with a lot of good features. I too, like others, question the quality. Amazon.com has been outstanding in handling my return issus. Kudos to them."
4,Technology Not There Yet,"This is a very nice player. It's the first one that I've owned so I have nothing to compare to. However, I have used flash memory drives. In retrospect, I should have waited until they came out with USB 2.0 and the ability to PnP without having to install custom drivers (Like flash drive, digital camera etc.) Why they haven't adopted these technologies yet is beyond me.Good: Usability, Sound, Battery life, Capacity.Bad: USB 1.1. Packaged software did not work. Had to download latest version from vendor web site. Does not come up as PnP logical drive letter like a flash drive."
5,"After firmware upgraded,It can serve as a removable disk.","This removable disk design makes it even simpler to transfer music files.Sometimes,it is handy to carry a few warez and documents in 195.Maybe,it can aslo be a usb bootdisk.My classmate bought one at 2300RMB,about 278Dollars in shanghai,China."
1,Worst quality ever,"I got this as a birhtday gift and, doh, it broke after just 3 days. Talked to Philip at J&R and he says there's a lot of complains about iriver products. Seems they use cheap parts and have ZERO support. The other reviews here read like planted positive praises, so beware. I was a real-life user, not affiliated with any electronics company, so take my advice, do not buy iriver. Many owners find out the hard way. Now Evolution is another no-name brand, but better."
1,"It's cute, I guess...But why?","Half a gigabyte of storage? For only (literally) a few dollars more, you can have a 15 GIGABYTE iPod! People complain about the iPod being too expensive, but from a cost/benefit perspective, it's an amazing bargain compared to this overpriced, underperforming trinket."
