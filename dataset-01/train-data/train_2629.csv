1,Never again,I am black (not mixed) and my hair is a little longer than half way down my back. When I used this product my hair became so very hard and kinky I couldn't comb it out. I had to use another shampoo over it in order to soften it so I could comb it. It probably works according to specific hair grades. Definitely not mine!
5,Great Memphis Soul,"Irma Thomas is a true soul survivor! and she delivers that on this great soul cd, Irma is in great voice, soul cd's like this are becoming a rarity these days, great songs and musicians on this set! This is one of Irma's best records!"
4,Irma teams with Dan Penn for a great CD.,"Irma Thomas and Dan Penn is a marriage made in heaven. This is Irma's best CD to date. Penn's songs show off her voice and his production is very simple but so good. On past CD's I've always felt that Irma needed stronger material and Penn can still write great R&B songs. He just needed the right singer. Most songs are new but Irma gives her interpretation to some of Dan's classics. Not since Aretha has Dan Penn's songs sounded this good. Not since ""Wish Someone Would Care"" has Irma had such great material. This is an absolute treat, not to be missed."
5,If you only get one book....,"This was the single most helpful book I found to help complete the process of writing an entire mystery. Its most valuable section is on plotting, devoting the appropriate amount of time and space to each of the critical parts of a novel. Much of the advice here is to be found else where--the back story, the characters, the scene writing--but is better organized and more comprehensible in this volume. So, if you plan to only buy or use one book on writing, this is the one I believe would be the best place to concentrate your time and money."
2,100 Pages Too Long,"The authors offer some good stuff on the ingredients of a mystery, but most of it comes early in the first section with their proposed template. From there on, things get redundant, and the authors become tedious. Maybe I was hoping for more of a manual. There is a line between guidance and smothering. They could have easily condensed their text by half. Also, I found no mention of any other type of perpetrator character other than a ""killer."" Not all mysteries are homicide. But, it sure was murder trying to wade through the book."
5,This is a wonderful book.,I use this book all the time and I am working on an outline using this method. I'm hooked on this book. I also have The Weekend Novelist by this same author.
2,Weekend novelist? Probably not.,"Writing fiction is like painting a landscape. A lot of artists can do it, and each one has an individual way they do it. It is the same with writing. Many people have written good novels; each one approaches it differently. So when someone like Ray Robert tells you how it's done, don't believe him. I'm not saying that his method doesn't work for him. What I am saying is it probably won't work for you. (It didn't work for me.) You have to figure out what works for you. Check out Immediate Fiction by Jerry Cleaver. You won't regret it."
3,Very hard to adjust.,"Does its job but mines came cracked, but i still used it the knobs however are really stiff and you just dont have a nice range of bubbles if your seeking to power a fry tank. i tried adjusting it but its either more than you want or less. does its job but not the best, took me awhile to find a decent air flow."
3,cassette player,"Awesome price for the features offered. I would have preferred a removable faceplate over the whole deck but Pyramid did not offer the other features I wanted with that option. As a loyal cassette ""Player"", I shopped for the accessory input jack so that I can use my CD and MP3 players with the deck. The opposite capability is not easy or typical. Downward/backward compatibility is never easy to find; this forces the consumer into puchases the don't always want or need. Thank you Pyramid for your devotion to the classics."
4,Surprise,"I was not familiar with this group. When I had heard a song I recognized (Fly Me Corageous) but didn't know the artist, I tracked down the group. This is a nice collection of a unique genre of music. It grows on you."
5,drivin n cryin,i bought it for my hubby. he loves it. he'll probably buy more of this group. thank you for a good cd..
5,the way an intoduction to philosophy should be,"What is great about this book is that it immeadiately engages you in ancient debates, which is what ancient philosophy is about. Do you really want a list of names and principle doctrines? There are plenty of books like that. There was a different consciousness in ancient times; to read ancient philosophy through our modern consciousness is to misread it. This book helps to engage the reader as the ancients engaged in their philosophy."
4,RE-RELEASED THIS AGAIN,DON'T GET ME WRONG THIS IS A GREAT COLLECTION WITH GREAT MOVIES OF THE PUPPET MASTER SERIES BUT COME ON NOW THIS DERSERVE BETTER FOR ALL THE FANS OF THE PUPPET MASTER SAGA. TRUST ME THIS WILL GET RE-RELEASED ONE DAY WITH BETTER FEATURE LIKE DELETED SCENES AND BEHIND THE SCENE FEATURETTE AND NOT ONLY THAT IT NEED TO BE WIDESCREEN. [...]
3,MANY GREAT TRACKS,"This CD has plenty of great tracks from amazing artists. My favorite being LTJ Bookem ""horizons"" with a special inserp. It mixes, it flows, and the DJ's don't stop mixing and spinning. Some songs are not as danceable as others, but it's worth buying because of the featured artists and the fact that's it's all for a great cause."
5,It would Make a Good Movie,A surpirisingly accurate portrayal of some of what I know to be true of life in poor southern mountain states. The author seems to say that it is genetics and history that create peoples values and character or the lack of it. Once the slide begins it can go unchecked into a very dark place or be halted by something or somebody if the conditions are right. Fast paced and very engaging. A good story that could be a really great movie.
1,My Favorite Brunette,Poor video transfer quality and sound. Highly unrecommended. There should be laws against creating such garbage.
5,Love my little rice cooker.,"I love this rice cooker. It's easy, fast and makes great rice. I owned a Sanyo for 25 years, so it made sense to buy Sanyo again. Great product!!!!!"
2,3-cup rice cooker,"I bought this product based on previous experience with an older model of the same brand. What a DISAPPOINTMENT. If one follows the cooking instructions provided,the rice ends up completely uncooked. Also the steamer bowl is too small for anything but beans. If cooked to perfection by "" trial-and-error"" the rice will stick to the button, on a non-stick surface. The old model was cheaper and much better."
5,The little rice cooker that could,Love it!! Reasonably priced and totally gets the job done and then some. It's great if you're cooking for one or a whole crowd. I feel smart for purchasing it:-)
4,"No ""OFF"" switch","The only complaint I have on this rice cooker is that there is no OFF button. When it is done cooking, it switches over the WARM & will stay there until you unplug the cooker. I wish it went directly to OFF or had the option for WARM or OFF."
3,misleading cup size,"Note that the ""3 cup"" size is not your typical 8oz. size. The one supplied with the rice cooker and is to used following their directions, is a 6 oz. cup. So, instead of having 3 cooked cups of rice, you only get 2.25 cups of rice. Other than this, I found the cooker works very well."
1,Non-stick begin to fall down after 4-months use,"AT first, I am pleased with the product. Just do what it should do and easy to clean.However, after 4-months use, I found the non-stick within the bowl began to fall down from piece to piece. I believe I have aten some of them. This is really frustrated!"
3,"the best would have been a ""thoughts 2""-maxi","compared to their other records, ""V"" is a real disappointment. ""The Great Nothing"" is exactly what its title suggests (28 minutes of boring music, I ask myself how a band that has done some of the greatest longtracks ever such as ""the light"" and ""the water"" can record such a dull song), ""at the end of the day"" is just another rock song and ""goodbye to yesterday"" is one of the worst ballads I've ever had to listen to. Where have all those great vocal harmonies and celestial melodies gone?? When did Neal Morse lose all those fantastic ideas that made Spock's Beard a genuine band??? The problem is that ""thoughts 2"" is such a great and crazy, Gentle Giant-influenced classic that it's worth buying the album only because of this wonderful piece of music. (how sad the song only runs about 4 minutes)."
2,a very disappointing effort from a great band,"I was very excited when I first purchased this album. After the fantastic Day For Night, and Neal Morse's great solo album, I was expecting a master-work. Not so here. After owning this for about a month, I have only listened to it twice. I know what you're probably thinking - that it takes time to get into it - but what I've always loved about SB is that while the music is complex and progressive, it's easy to get into and (dare I say it) it's catchy. This one left me cold, and the only thing I can remember from the CD is the chorus section for ""At the End of the Day,"" and that is not saying much. If you're a first time SB buyer, go with Day for Night or The Kindness of Strangers."
4,Shades of ELP,"This is my first SB disc, but I will be buying more. On the first listen I was not overly impressed, but kept coming back and listening to it again. Now I can hear what a fantastic piece of work this truely is. Reminds me heavily of Emerson Lake and Palmer's ""Brain Salad Surgery"", a favorite of mine from years ago.If you are an old fan of ELP and Floyd, but itching for something fresh, you have found it!"
4,Nice album!,"Having 3 of the Beard's albums, I have to say this is my favorite. Althought ""The Great Nothing"" would be worth enough for buying ""V"", the rest of the album has also nice elements that would make almost any prog rock fan happy. Too bad I missed the opportunity of attending one of their shows. Recommended."
3,falls short,"This is a bit of a let down after the previous album. Half this cd is taken up by a 27 minute long rambling. I dont mind epics but this was easily a ""lets see if we can make a super long song."" There are parts of the song that are amazing but I really dont feel like listening through 15 minutes to get there. Basically this album just doesnt come near the technical genious of the last album. Of course die hard fans will give 5 stars no matter what they put out. I just wish there was a little more here. (I still enjoyed it better then DT's six degrees. You wont hear any circus synths on here.)"
2,"Yes, I'd like some prog with extra cheese.","There are some instrumental parts of the songs that are really cool, but as a whole I can only handle listening to it by forwarding through to those instrumental bits because the rest of it is so corny. The lyrical parts of the songs sound just like the purposefully cheesy spoof music that they use on ""South Park"". I would recommend to anyone considering purchasing this to listen to more than a couple of short clips. If you're looking for a mixture of prog and over dramatic soft rock like you see on the religious channel you'll love it."
3,long and boring songs? why?,"This is a good album, songs 2,3,4,5 are awesome; great tunes and great music. The first and the last songs are very awefully long! It's a very boring way that most prog bands these days are adopting. Why would you want to play a song for over 30 minutes if even 5 minutes of it doesn't sound interesting at all?"
1,Don't,Don't buy this unless you want to see talent wasted on horrible sappy garbage. I'm embarrased for anyone who performs or enjoys this type of music.
2,*shrug*,"'At the End of the Day' has a nice hook and arrangementthat is at times excellent, but the song is too busyand overlong. It's still quite listenable and interesting,but I can't make a steady diet of it.I find the rest of the CD fairly dull, except for'Thoughts Pt. 2', which is more childish than dull.Maybe better than, say, Kansas, but why not just listento early 70s Renaissance instead? Annie Haslam has aboutfour times the vocal range of Neal Morse."
2,Disappointing,What can I say? Maybe they just got me used to such brilliant music that this album just turn me off. The music is lousy and it seems like they were in a hurry. I hope it was just vacation time and the next one will take us back to the real Spock's Beard
1,Mediocre 70's AOR generic clone,"Ignore the hype. This is not the ""best"" this or that all these other reviews are hyping it as. This is ""progressive"" if you consider a mediocre take on music in the style of 70's AOR bands like Boston, Styx and their FM radio ilk ""progressive"". This is neither as well written, interesting nor innovative as the real 70's proggers like Yes, Genesis, Gentle Giant or King Crimson were at the time, nor the scores of excellent current bands that aren't trying to live in the past and are TRULY progressive like Thinking Plague, Djam Karet, Godspeed You Black Emperor or even major label bands like Tool, Radiohead and Mr. Bungle.Thanks, but no thanks."
5,The best yet from the best!,"I could write a lengthy paean about the virtues of this astonishing album. But suffice it to say that the mighty Beard continues to outdo itself with each successive album. The world's reigning prog rock kings have crafted an opus of classic proportions. With their usual flair of combining shorter, poppier songs with lengthy, multipart prog epics, the Beard have taken their game to a new summit of creative virtuosity. Is The Great Nothing the best prog epic ever, even besting Close to the Edge? Quite possibly. You be the judge. If you're a proghead and still don't own this album, put your order in without delay. You'll be glad you did."
2,Definately Different,"After waiting with great anticipation for this new SB release simply entitled ""V"", I have to say I'm very dissapointed. This is definately my least favorite Spock's Beard effort. It seems that Neal Morse abandoned his sense of ""melodic adventure"" for a heavier more ""technical"" sound. As a result, ""V"" contains very few memorable moments. The first cut ""At The End Of The Day"" starts off promising, but rapidly deteriorates into a plodding piece. The next four cuts contain sparse melodies, certainly nothing in the usual ""Beard tradition"". The final track ""The Great Nothing"" should be the title cut. This track is the best on this CD, but again falls way short of classic SB."
4,"ANOTHER ""TACTICAL UNIT"" WINNER",IF YOU'RE A FAN OF THIS SERIES YOU'LL ENJOY THIS ONE. IT FEATURES 2 SEPARATE UNIT COMMANDERS AND THEIR SQUADS THAT ARE ALWAYS TRYING TO OUTDO THE OTHER WHEN IT COMES TO CRIME BUSTING. NOW THEY MUST JOIN FORCES TO HUNT DOWN AND FACE A PARTICULY VICOUS GANG. SIMON YAM SHINES AS ALWAYS.
3,good,"Has all the basics that is needed. It is an older book, which is easily seen by looking at the 1980 pictures! I read it, and now my 13 year old son is reading it, then next my 10 year old, and finally 9 year old. As always i bought it because I got it cheap from Amazon with no shipping! Could not go wrong. Book was nice and clean."
3,A must for Andy Kaufman fans,"Of the few movies Andy Kaufman appeared in, this was his best performance in a movie.He plays ""Armageddon T Thunderbird"" a rich and greedy preacher.The movie is really about goofing on organized religion.A few funny moments but not hysterical"
4,Glad to see Gabrielle's music in the USA,"I was in London in March 2000, when the single ""Rise"" was the #1 hit in the UK. I bought the CD to bring home with me, and really enjoyed it. I'm happy to see her getting some recognition in the US! ""Rise"" is my favorite -- brilliant lyrics, and love the ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" sample. Worth checking out!"
5,Sultry Sixties Soul,"This is soul...music that Marvin Gaye, Mary Wells and Sam Cooke could appreciate. British soul has always been a little more soulful that the ""clicky-clicky thump"" music on the US airwaves. Gabrielle, a slinky little vocalist fills the room with heartbreak and triumph on this third release. The title single, ""Rise"" begins oh so quietly, then in typical Gabrielle fashion mounts into an understated declaration of self-confidence. Further efforts on the album, the funky ""5 O'Clock"" and the summery 1967 stylings of ""When A Woman"", ""Falling"" and ""If You Love Me"" cement this as a truely honest work-you can hear every tear and feel every victory. ""Rise"" covers no ground that hasnt been well tread by greats like Redding and Franklin but oh what a path to tread."
5,Extremely Helpful Guide,"This is more of a guide book that fits quite nicely in your lab coat pocket. As nutrient and medications are explained, there are many more advantages such as references to specific lab values and thier normal limits, nutrient and micronutrient food sources, height-weight tables, ideal body weight calculations and more. A must for any health professional not directly working with medications."
5,Teacher*KathyD,"Attention teachers and parents...Buy this book! I frequently use these puzzles as warm-up activities in my gifted and talented class and my 6-8 graders LOVE them. On the days we don't do a PERPLEXOR, they ask for them! These are also great for free time activities and for filling an extra few minutes with something that is fun for the kids and encourages them to THINK. Highly recommended!"
5,Excellent!!,"This workbook is definitely a hit in our home! My 9 year old has finished the book and has already asked for another one. They are very challenging, but not enough to be ""frustrating""."
4,Great Logic Puzzles,"My eight year old son uses these to focus his brain and they really work to get him thinking outside of the normal paradigms of memorization. Love these, I can visibly see him focus his thinking after doing a couple of these."
1,Weak design.,"Bought a box of these locally today to use on drywall. Beware, the sheet metal heads break off with even the slightest torque, making it impossible to either finish the initial instal or to ever remove the screw. AVOID"
3,NEEDS SPECIFIC SIZE... great price for OK bare bones rim,"As another reviewer noted, the worst thing about this is the size needs to be very specific. 16"" can mean ""standard"" 305 or 349. Because tire sizing can be pretty confusing once you move away from 700c or 26"" mountain bike standard, I would prefer an exact millimeter measurement of the outer diameter of the rim, as well as a millimeter measurement of the diameter of where the tire bead would sit, as well as an approximate millimeter measurement of the outer diameter with a typical tire.I took a gamble and ordered it, had to return it. A typical bike shop doesn't even have this product in their catalog because it's towards the bottom of the price bracket, so you can't even confirm the specs of a part like I normally would."
4,Cool Book.,"Kendall's Book is an enlightened journey through the soul of someone trying to understand the mystery of the will of God. It pays homage to the wonderous works of the creator and the fruits of its creation, while at the same time giving a critical eye to the world's imperfections, with valuable onsight on how to improve thins. All in all, an excellent book."
3,A Good Insight into the actual Bangladesh,"The book puts forward some informative data about the small picturesque green Bangladesh, nestled between the vast India and Myanmar. It is informative in the sense that it provides the reader with an accumulation of various data accumulated over the years, but I would not recommend it to a tourist who would want to visit Bangladesh, using this book as a guide. Provides good insight, but could be improved much, much more by giving more interesting material to read about and a lot of pictures. Overall, a mediocre book."
1,I have it & I hate it,"The Mirra backup we bought was a huge waste of money. Making files accessible from the server to web access has been problematic and spotty. Recovering files that were backed up and show on the Mirra always fails. We have not had to use it for a big system failure, but based on the performance in these first 2 areas.... I will not be holding my breath counting on it to save the day... and support is nonexistant."
2,Not for Catholic Churches,This book will be very informative for Catholics who want to know why their churches look like Protestant ones.Don't use this book if you are assisting in renovations or building a Catholic church!
5,the heart's true home,"Many members, one body. A delightfully refreshing look at the differences we have as individuals in the church through our communication with and worship of God. Thomas confirms our own uniqueness through nine ""Sacred Pathways"" to God - the naturalist, sensate, traditionalist, ascetic, activist, caregiver, enthusiast, contemplative and intellectual. He provides practical ways to test yourself at the end of each chapter to determine your own path. Just as God communicated differently for Moses, Elijah, and Paul, we too hear Him and worship Him in different ways. What a confirmation that you don't have to be a clone, but rather, can follow the direction God has put into your own heart. This book spoke to my spirit and I've recommended it to many. It is a must for pastors who wish to understand their congregation better. Thomas expands our horizons without compromising the message."
5,Great Book,"I read Gary's ""Sacred Marriage"" and it totally transformed my marriage and the way I thought about my marriage. So I bought ""Sacred Pathways"" and I have learned so much about who I am and how I worship. I always thought that my way of being with God was strange and not like other Christians and now I can see why I have never ""fit"" in with others and that is ok now. I have learned to embrace it and my walk has grown so much stronger."
5,Insightful tool of reflection,"If you are trying to find a way to connect better with God, then this little guide may point you in the right direction."
4,excellent,Once again I find this book excellent as a tool to help me connect with God & to pass that information onto others.
3,Promise out of MN,"As a displaced Saint Paul resident I may be a little bias, but this album isn't half bad. Favorites from the album are ""Forget The Fashoin"" and ""Alias: The Bookeeper"" (with guest vocals from Justin Pierre from Motion City Soundtrack). On vocals, I think STBALS stands out from the cookie-cutter singing voice heard so often today.This CD overall is decent, some awesome songs along with some obviously flawed songs (the last track on the album for example), but if you have a few extra dollars lying around I'd say check it out. It's promising for sure. I think they can only get better..."
4,Potty Time,"This book has been great for my son! He gets very excited when he gets the Potty Trophie, and we use the trophie to lure him into the bathroom. He knows he only gets the trophie when he actually goes potty, so he makes an effort every time."
3,The Trophy,This book is helpful for my children because it lets them know that it may take time to learn how to use the potty but that they should continue their efforts. It's message that just trying makes you a champion is a very positive one. My boys love to claim that they are a champ and run around the house with their trophy. It makes the whole experience a lot more fun for them.
4,Curly head,"The Good Dog Aladdin Paperback, 2001, $5.99 Avi ISBN 0-689-83824-7What would you do if you were a dog that had to choose between living in the wild or staying with your humans? Would you just run off, or would you stay to protect them? That's what a dog named McKinley has to do when a wolf named Lupin comes along trying to change everything. McKinley's character is all about helping dogs and doing the best he can to help them.Avi begins each chapter with such excitement that it makes you wish you were in the story. McKinley gets exhausted, after all that's going on, but learns that helping others can give you the best reward.The Good Dog is a remarkable book by Avi. People who like adventure and dogs will love this book. When I read the book the pages were turning them selves. I couldn't stop reading it. It was full of excitement, tons of adventure and lessons about helping others."
4,Avi does it again!!!,"The Good Dog is a book about a dog named McKinley who is the leader of all the dogs in Steamboat Springs, Colarado. McKinleys first problem is trying to keep his job as head dog. The second problem starts when Lupin ,a wolf, tries to recruit all the dogs including McKinley to join her to run free. McKinley has to choose to stay with his human pup Jack or to run free with Lupin."
3,The Good Dog,"The Good Dog is fiction. There are lots of characters in this book, but the main ones are McKinley, the dog; Jack, McKinley's owner; and Redburn, Duchess' owner.Redburn is trying to catch Duchess, she has ran away. He wants Jack and McKinley to try to find her. Redburn says that if McKinley hurts Duchess that Jack's parents are going to hear about it.If you don't like adventures don't read this book. If you like adventures read this book. The Good Dog has lots of adventures that McKinley goes through."
5,The Best Book,"I like this book because it has lots of details and it's from the dog's point of view. It is about a dog named McKinley and a wolf. McKinley is the head dog of the pack in Steamboat Springs. He has to pick whether to stay with his human pup Jack, or to go out with the wolf Lupin. He also has to deal with the lost dog Duchess.I highly recommend you to get this book. You won't be sorry once you have read it!!!"
4,A review by a Fifth Grader in Los Angeles,"The Good Dog is a great book by Avi. If you have never read a book by Avi, you should read one as your next book! I liked The Good Dog because of how Avi explaned how the dogs talked and called things, like a T.V. a ""glowing box"" and skis ""sliding sticks"". The book starts with McKinley, the head dog of the pack of steamboat Springs, is walking down the street and he sees a poster on a lamppost with a picture of a dog on it. He recognizes the dog as Duchess and thinks she propaly ran away again and her owner is looking for her, but McKinley's adventurs dont end with findind Duchess. I think this book is very good, but there is one weakness to it that it is pure adventure and barely any story behind it. I have to say that this book is great and any adventure-and-dog-lover will love this book!!!"
3,Allen at richview middle,This story is about a dog named Mckinley with a girlfriend named Aspen an enemie named redburn and a wolf named lupin.
1,Does not fit CHV1510,This was paired together and stated it would fit the Black and Decker CHV1510. NOT. What a waste of money. Do some research other than on Amazon to make sure this is the filter to fit your vac. I would give it less than a star if I could.
1,Not for CHV1410L,"Disclosure - I have not purchased this item and here is why:While looking for replacement filters for our Dustbuster CHV1410L, I found that Amazon has paired this item with the CHV1410L as the correct replacement. The photos of these look nothing like the filters in the CHV1410L. Amazon needs to correct this. If the photos are wrong, then post the correct one. If the photos are accurate, then remove these and replace with the correct product. Judging from the numerous complaints in these reviews, my guess is it is the latter."
1,Product does not include parts shown,"This filter was shown as a ""Customer's also bought..."" item with a CHV1510 Dustbuster and it is shown with the filter holder. It does not come with the filter holder and does not fit the CHV1510."
1,Product Not As Advertised,"I bought these filters because it said they are often bought with the vaccum I got. Recently, I went to put them in the vaccum and discovered they do not fit. To boot, I missed the window to get a refund. Rip off!"
3,Quality of Filter,B&D Dustbuster - Cyclonic Action. Quality of filter was good. Had to modify it w/ my grinder to make it fit a Type 3 vacuum...Amazon did not show or offer a filter for Type 3 unit. There is a VF100 Type 1 and a Type 3. Delivery & communication were excellent
1,Not the correct replacement And is not worth a dollar!,"This item was advertised as the replacement of my Black and Decker DustBuster on the Amazon website. I purchased them together the same day. Having them together meant it was the correct replacement. However, it was completely different. I just put it away as it was 2 months later when I discovered the discovered that, and the time I would spend contacting either the seller or Amazon for that inaccuracey would cost more than a few dollars' refund. But I truely believe that little thing can never be worth even a couple of dollars. If I find it in the dollar store, I'll surely hesitate to purchase it for 99 cents!"
1,Big question mark ?????,I have no idea how to use this particular item. In fact I am probably going to return it to you.
1,Proofreading II,It was - despite recommendations - the wrong filter. Why was this obvious oversight not caught beforehand? I was disappointed.
1,Wrong filter,Wrong replacement filter--does NOT fit all cyclonic action dustbusters. Problem is that it is not really worth returning the item for credit.
3,"Good find, but not happy about the life!","I love using my dust buster and these filters do what they are meant to do, however, I feel like they really should be changed VERY often, making them pretty expensive. Also, there isn't any good way of removing the dust from the filter to be able to extend the life of it. Maybe it's because I am using it for fine dust (like after I sweep, I'll suck up the pile of dirt). So all in all, I was very happy to have found these filters on here (since I could not find them in the store), but I am not happy with the fact that they need to be changed often to be effective."
5,alif baa was easy,This book made learning the arab alphabet easy. I completed the workbook with ease. The cassettes were very helpful with learning the pronounciation of the individual letters. I would recommend this workbook for anybody wanting to learn the arabic alphabet.
5,Excellent introduction to Arabic letters and sounds.,"This book is a very well-considered introduction to Arabic letters and sounds. It focuses on the difficulties English speakers have in recognizing and pronouncing letters such as ""DHaa"" vs ""daal"". The companion cassettes are absolutely necessary; the book is worthless without them. Exercises consist mainly of differentiating between similar-sounding words, and distinguishing what letter actually appears in a spoken word. No ""answers"" to the exercises are given, but I found none were needed. The book is intended to take 6 weeks of study to finish."
5,An excellent intro to Arabic letters and sounds.,"I first learned to speak Arabic with this text and I now use it when I teach. I have used many texts (some written and published in the Arab world), but non come close to the simplicity of Alif Baa. One thing the editors could work on is updating the pictures in the book. They are dated and almost silly to look at."
3,Answer Key Really is Obligatory,"I just want to let anyone interested in this book to know that the exercises really are not useful unless you have an answer key so this book as nice as it is with the CD audio component is not useful without an answer key. The answer key can be found at the Georgetown University publications website for only $3 plus shipping, but even better the book with CD and answer key are sold as a package on this site. For anyone interested in buying this book I would direct them in the direction of the Georgetown University publications website for no other reason than the answer key is sold as part of the package with the book."
5,"A Great Mystery, perfect blend of golf and suspense","I read this book originally only because I have recently taken up golf. However, upon starting the book I found myself drawn into it. The plot of the book centers around Alan Saxon, and the trouble he faces while designing a golf course in Bermuda. He has a long vivist in the country, and plans to take his daughter with him. his ex-wife then dumps one of his daughter's frinds on him as well. This book will keep you turning pages. I reccomend it to any reader."
1,CAUTION,"CAUTION TO BUYERS: I ordered a text book for my daughter that was labeled ""used-acceptable"". What I received was a pile of pages without a binding, cover, complete with missing pages(even the index) and even the back cover is peeling back and in pieces. The whole book smells like it has sat in a mold. As a matter of fact it is making me sneeze.I am appauled that someone would even try to sell this pile of pages labeled ""text book"" it clearly does not fit the profile for a book. I am still awaiting an email from the seller to send it back for a FULL refund. This was a waste of my time and money. I hope Amazon will monitor this seller.America: Pathways to the Present"
4,A good book for the beautiful wiccan!,"When I first skimmed through the book, I was going to give it 2 stars... It was not what I had expected it to be. I had expected it to be a book about spells in enhance or increase beauty, but in fact, it is mostly about spells using beauty products (such as soap, lotion, perfumes, etc.). I was rather disappointed at first. But, then I decided to read through it a little more thoroughly. It does include some recipes on beauty-enhancing spells and items (beauty soap, beauty perfume...). In addition to that, it explains how to make basic soap (but not from scratch!), lotions, perfume bland, massage oils, shampoos, conditioners, and other products. For anyone interested in both spellcraft and natural beauty products, I would definitely reccomend this book. Anyone looking for a get-ptretty-quick spell, don't bother with this, there's nothing like that in here. My final vote: 4 and a half stars"
3,Enchantments:200 Spells,"It wasn't what I expected. The spells seamed plain, they were nonthing that wowed me and really excited me. It did give me a couple new ideas so thats a star, it arrived on time so thats another star, and I just gave a third star to give a third star because it wasn't that bad of a book and two stars would make it seem like it was a bad book."
2,Candid and Creepy,"In Ovid at Fifteen, Christopher Bursk weaves father and son, child and old man together in a contemplative, candid, and melancholically creepy work. Bursk seems to be contemplating his own sins in relation to those of his father, forging experience and mythology into a personal and unflinching series of poems. Through Bursk's recollections, we see the disturbing, the personal, the thoughts and experiences laid vulnerable and bare, left for us to observe and contemplate. Like Ovid, Bursk creates an unsettling mythology where the gods have been stood upon their heads.Despite the candor and mythologized sense of his past, though, Bursk leaves the reader (at least me) highly unsettled. The graphic homo-eroticism of his recollections, particularly of his father and his youth, make the objective coolness of his classroom experiences (as a teacher) seem out of place. As confessional poetry, I'm afraid the Bursk may have confessed too much."
3,Not for computer professionals,I was expected much more of this book. It is very general. It is meant for general public not for computer professionals. There is lots of repeating. 1200 pages of text with just a few pictures. Very boring. It is meant more for lawyers and philosophers than for other population. I don't recommend for system or network administrators.
3,In good condition but took a while to ship,The book was delivered in good condition and within the specified date range. However it took a few weeks to recieve the package. I ordered another book at the same time and recieved the book in half the time.
2,Beware: Difficult Read,"Perhaps this book explains Schopenhauer with amazing clarity and detail, but I couldn't make it past the first 50 pages. It's just one multi-page paragraph after another. The author needs to learn the concept of whitespace.The introduction to ""Essays and Aphorisms"" provides a concise look at Schopenhauer for the casual reader."
3,WWJD LDS?,"I read the other reviewers comments to get a decent understanding of this video series and entered a theological debate. Seriously?! The beauty of being a ""fearfully and wonderfully made"" creature of the almighty God is the element of Free Will. I do not ascribe to the heretical views of the Church of the LDS but I do accept their individual right to choose ""whom they will serve."" That being said as I recall this video series is well executed, teaches basic/fundamental bilical fact and has a nice soundtrack in the background."
3,"non-technicle, intro earth-science book","very basic, simple geological concepts and explanations involving volcanology, ocanography, geophysics, etc. anybody can read this interesting book about the processes of the earth, and how humans have attempted to understand it. it is basicaly the more interesting chapters in any college-level Geology 101 course. up to date, very easy to read."
4,"Good, read my review & comments","Excellent quality platters, cool wooden trays (bright as pine wood), perfect for TEPPAN YAKI . Actually, I purchased these ones because they're the real classic platters (no attached handle but separate one). One more thing: each one can serve a single meal as they are both come in medium size. Great product at a very affordable price. I really recommend this for house & restaurant kitchens.... Cheers-----------------------------------------------Update: 7/23/2011 ... Sorry, I was kinda lazy to update :PI downgraded my rating from 5 stars to 2 due to:The platters get rusty very quickly once you wash'em & dry'em. This happened after 3 months of use ... find something else. I wouldn't recommend this product neither for home usage nor business... You get what you pay forAhmed"
3,Not a review but a question,"This is not a review but a question about this product (have tried e-mailing the seller but have not received a reply). Would someone who owns the platters be able to give me the dimensions (of the platter, not the tray) so I can make sure they are large enough for my needs before ordering. According to the seller's return policy, I'd have to pay the return shipping if I sent them back, and would certainly rather avoid that. If anyone can help, I'd be very grateful!"
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed with this product. The trays are much smaller than I needed. They heat well and would probably be great if you were serving stir-fry or fajitas. Since I only tried them once I can't say how long they hold the heat. The handle is a nice addition. I should have paid more attention to the size before I bought them. I suggest you check before you purchase to see if they are large enough to fill you need.
4,"Saul Williams ""The Seventh Octave""","This book was a gift for a close friend of mine and in his words, he has loved it. The words speak volumes to him and it's been great to see him this happy over something simple as a book of poetry. I recommend anyone that wants to read some really deep poetry should buy this book."
4,A children's book with an endearing heroine,"This story of an orphan and her pet kitten never quite reached the popularity that stories of other plucky orphans (or quasi-orphans) received, but readers who are fond of Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm or Anne of Green Gables will find much to enjoy. Like those heroines, Clematis is far from perfect, which keeps some of the more sentimental scenes from cloying."
5,Brazilian Hardcore!,"This is a great record, from start to finish. Recorded and released in 1983, the original record Crusicados Pelo Sistema really stood on its own, being such an influential release from Brazil at the time. Sistemaos Pelo Crusifa is a re-recording of all the classic tracks, with some extras on for good measure. The sound is great, with awesome Raw production, and the chaps at Alternative Tentacles have also added the original album in full as a bonus track (so you can compare the two versions). Gordo's voice is now more brutal and grunting in the style of Buddha (BFB) or Dean from noise legends Extreme Noise Terror (if you like bands such as ENT or Brummie punks I.O.D. i suggest you pick this up). Probably my favorite release on Tentacles."
4,Watch out!,"If you're looking for the remastered edition of the great 80's Crucificados pelo Sistema album, forget it! This CD is a re-recording of the same songs made in 1999. Anyway RDP was the best hardcore band from Brazil and this songs are all really classics."
1,Torture the Reader...,"Although I loved The Anomilies (Five Stars), TTA is so bad I wish I had never picked it up. That being said, I do like the cover art and I hear the author is really the guitarist for Weezer (the one that got kicked out). Even with this knowledge I cannot condone the purchase of this book. Look for it in your local library instead."
1,Unfortunately Lame,"Sorry to have to pan it, but as far as I got in the book, it was self-important and self-indulgent."
5,Grill saver,"I love my Lodge cast iron grill. This is my third one. Bought my first grill in 1979, second in 1996 and now my third one. First time I have bought the cover. It fits perfect and works great. Very heavy duty."
5,grill cover,Great product. . .still performing in all kinds of weather after a number of years of outdoor use.
2,Nice but I dont use it,I would not purchase this again if given the opportunity - nice quality - just not practical for me. Would not recommend unless you are keeping your grille in top shape
3,Lodge Sportsman's Cover,"This is a nice heavy duty cover for the Lodge Sportsman's Grill, however, the cover is made about an inch or so too small and must be stretched everytime to fit the cover over the grill. This is a hassle!!! It would be better if looser, with a drawstring at the bottom. Probably outsourced to a manufacturing plant in CHINA, so you are stuck with a cover that a wife cannot stretch over the grill!"
5,Protect your grill,I cook out doors a lot protecting my equipment is very important to me the cover will ensure my grill last as long as I do
4,works,"the cover is really tight which can make getting it on and off difficult, but that also keeps it from blowing off in winds. i also bought from walmart a larger grill cover with drawstring so i can cover grill and table all-in-one with this cheaper cover. still the cover is a good purchase and looks nice."
3,Grill Cover,"I recently purchased the Grill and Cover. I'm pleased with both. The cover is well made and appears to be very durable. I thought it was a bit pricey but after I saw it, I understand. Remember the grill is cast iron not stainless and needs to be oiled on a regular basis."
2,Ok but it eventually fades and leaks,"I never thought I would write a review of a grill cover, but Amazon dared me! Here's the skinny. The cover fits tightly but it is a tad short to cover the legs all the way down to their tips with its strong elastic edge. No big deal, the cast iron legs are not in danger of rusting out. I've had mine out on the patio in the Kansas sun for two summers and it has faded to a gray color on top, still black on the bottom, no big deal from my view either. But one little annoyance is that the seams on the fabric (all the way around the top edge when it is on) leak. So in a heavy rain water will drip inside and lead to surface rusting. That kind of defeats the purpose of the cover. This can probably be solved with the use of tent seam sealer. Are there awards for this kind of vital, investigative consumer reporting? The grill is great!"
4,"Better than nothing, I suppose","The funny thing about this grill cover is that it is incredibly flammable. Even after you've dumped the coals and any remaining embers out of the grill, the (little bit of) heat retained by the grill itself may be enough to melt the cover beyond usefulness. I've had to buy three of them for this reason. It would be better if it was less plasticky, but, for the most part I like it and it does the job."
3,It works as expected,"I wish this cover was the same quality of the grill. With that said, it serves it's purpose while feeling of lower quality than other Lodge products."
5,Buy this with your grill,Great combination the cast iron grill and this cover. We are able to leave the grill on our outside deck which makes it convenient to use.
2,Covers the grill but leaks at the seams,"The cover conforms perfectly to sportsman grill and looks pretty good to boot. However, after the first day in the rain I noticed that it had been leaking a small bit of water through which created rust spots on the charcoal grate. Being non-waterproof is kind of a big deal for a cast iron grill.Will have to waterproof the seams."
4,Almost a hit.,"I was a little surprised with this set. Don't get me wrong, you should buy it, but the edge lacked a little of the visual refinement of the rest of the line. Also, the block of wood shipped with the knives is made of pine, or some other very soft wood. It would be nice if it was a Maple match to the block that shipped with the 15 piece set. This is a very good set, but it could use a little help upon arrival with a very fine whetstone, and a proper hardwood block. If you don't mind 2 minutes per blade with an ultra fine stone, this set compares well with the best of the two big homegrown German brands. Don't get me wrong, this set is far above any stamped steel set (even the stamped offerings from the big German brands). Buy it and enjoy!"
4,not quite as pictured,"I ordered this for my toddler who has gone Dino crazy. Great price and perfect size for a cuddle, but the mouth is creepy. Opened way wider than shown."
2,right package wrong disc,"this product was mailed promptly and in a very good mailer.the product was in the case with unrated on it, the disc was stamped unrated but it is the R rated edition. the seller was not,i feel, aware of this. just be warned there are ssi discs out there with incorrect labeling. it is a good movie though and a.j. khan can act."
3,take it or leave it,Just not to much of a fan for softcore videos its just not worth the money for a bad acting and no action
3,Transmission auxiliary cooler,"Hi, I installed this unit inline as an auxiliary cooler with a 48re Dodge transmission. I was very careful installing the cooler, using Aeroquip fittings and braided stainless hose etc. I had leaks behind both influent and effluent, "" fnpt fittings of the cooler, not bad leaks but a fair dripping. I needed to use the truck, so I used silicone on the area behind the nuts and sealed them. It is still is damp around the areas but not dripping. Cooling is Ok, it did help the cooling some, not as much as expected with a fan driven unit. It works ok otherwise."
3,"Good concert, bad audio mix...","This is the same DVD that many other users have rated as having a terrible 5.1 mix with a fake audience track present over every single note played.Do yourself a favor a buy the same concert simply called Cinderella In Conert, for half the price as this newly released version. Amazon itself has a link in related items."
2,Lightweight gears,"The board platform is sturdy and a very good idea for very young kids but the plastic gears are too light for much else but throwing. You turn them and they twirl out of their holes and for interlocking gear action, the child must be a lot older (and restrained) to turn these without flipping one of the gears out of sequence. As a twirling toy, it's not bad, but for gears or much educational value, this one is a crank . . ."
2,Gears are not working,Wood board feels great (like a Melissa & Doug product) but the plastic gears are too light. My 18 months old can't play with it by himself and even if I try it more careful but maybe a little too fast the gears will jump off the board.
5,Great fun!,"My son got this toy for his first birthday which is a little below the recommended age (one of the pitfalls of them having birthdays close to the holidays) so he was not able to play with it the normal way for awhile but he still enjoyed the toy very much. Now at 17 months, he is able to play with it with the crank and all but he still loves to just play with the gears alone. It is colorful and sturdy and if your toddler is into making things move and putting things together (puzzles) then they will probably like this toy.The gears also make great spinning tops and your toddler will watch in amazement as you make them spin across the table/floor! And if they're like mine, they will try like crazy to spin them themselves."
2,Just does not work,"I was hoping for a low-tech version of Gearation Refrigerator Magnets (which are great), but was disappointed. Neither of my children could get the gears to work interactively without assistance from me, and even I had to work at it to make several gears turn with the crank. I am not sure if it is the placement of the holes or the lightweight gears."
1,Watch Fobs Poor Quality,These watch fobs were of very poor quality. The leather was thin and it broke the first time that my Dad tried to put the fob through his belt loop. The quality of these do not speak well for purchasing from Findgking.
1,crude and overpriced,"This item is also available as two black or two brown, or this list for one of each.The watch fob is crudely made. The leather is too thick and stiff to function properly as a watch fob.Seems to me that it is created and marketed by people who have never used it."
3,Kinda cheap and not sure if made of leather.,"For what they are, and the price, then I guess they are worth it. But don't give them as a gift, or expect them to impress."
2,Oh so formula!,"Ms. Myers two series are so formula and so predictable, but I had enjoyed the Den of Antiquity series more than the Magadalena Yoder series, but there comes a time when it just gets to be too much. The humour begins to seem forced, the antics frenetic and disjointed, and the bad guys (or gals) more clownish and unrealistic. That is the case here. Abby is on the trail of another killer and it leads her into peril herself, but somehow she manages to get away without suffering many ill effects. And I haven't even mentioned the editing - that is is so poorly done in each of these books. This book is no different in any way than any of the others, but the ending seems more forced and rushed than usual, especially for the books in this series. It made no sense. That's it. I'm done with Ms. Myers books - this was the last straw."
2,"sloppy, sloppy ,sloppy","As an avid reader of Tamar Myers, I have to say this was probably the weakest of all of her books. I had to look at the page numbers to make sure I wasn't missing a chapter. In one chapter Abby (the main character) is at the mercy of the killer and the next chapter she is safe at home. How did she get away? Where's the rest of the story? It's almost as if Ms. Myers had a deadline and had to finish the book without putting any thought into the ending. It was very disappointing. Still, I gave it two stars because the rest of the book is amusing. Just not her best work. Not by a long shot."
2,too much mess - not enough fun,"(...) Here's one from a parent of 6 & 7 year old girls. This toy is a ripoff!! The snow is a huge(!!!!!) mess. From the looks of the box - it is a house full of wonder - it is really silly. My girls are as creative and imaginative as you get - this toy just isn't doing it for them. Got it yesterday - moving it to the basement playroom this afternoon (once we get the snow cleaned). Ok, I sound bitter - but there are such better ways to spend your time and money!"
1,"Can we say ""mom's worst nightmare""?","For the price tag, you'd think this playset would actually come with something more than a few pieces of cheap plastic. The dolls can't even actually sit in the seats without falling out, the ski lift barely works, and the snow machine blows styrofoam (and not very well, I might add), which gets all over the place and is a complete pain to clean up! I would definitely not recommend buying this toy for your kids - I was sorely disappointed!"
2,Somewhat Disappointed,"I was somewhat disapointed with this toy. My 6-year old daughter loves playing with it, but it is not very practical. It's a great concept, but the product itself could use some improvement. The snow is made out of styrofoam, messy and hard to clean up. Beware if your household has younger siblings, because these small styrofoam balls can easily be digested by a curious toddler. The skilift is hard to operate, and many of the pieces do not stay in place."
3,Snow machine - is not!,"The ""snow machine"" does not make snoe like many assume it does. It simply creates a huge mess. The package states that you simply put the snow down and the machine will attract the ""snow: and send it up into the air. This does not happen! The only benefit of this machine is the science project you could get out of it by discussing electrons and neutrons - but that is not why we bought this toy for our daughter!"
5,Does this set come with skis?,How do the bratz dolls ski on the slope without skis?Maybe this set comes with skis and I didn't notice it.Well get it anyway because you could use the things that come with the bratz wintertime wonderland dolls.
2,Failed in less than a year,"I purchased a set of these as part of an aeration system for an outdoor pond and they all failed in less than a year. It does what it's supposed to while it can, but the cheap spring in the valve will fail and the rubber valve attached to the spring will fall out within the chamber. I'll acknowledge that you shouldn't expect any check-valve to last forever, but less than a year is pretty bad. Maybe it would be better for a small indoor aquarium, rather than my small outdoor pond. I would personally not be buying this product again for either scenario."
4,Dragon Tempest,"I must admit I am not as well pleased by this title as I was with the first in the series. I really enjoyed the ""Dragons Companion"" first book, the second one ""Dragons Rescue"" was too thrilling, and the third one is diffinitely alot better then the second one. I am happy to say that the series appears to be looking up so far and I am very relieved to see that a fourth book is left open for writing at the ending of this one."
4,Really Good,"I'm normally one for a romance book, or something like Gossip Girl and The Clique, but this book was really good. It was required in school, so I was a little worried...but a very good book."
5,Courtesy of Teens Read Too,"In this thrilling mystery about two eighth-grade reporters, a blackmail case is solved. Steven Thomas and Susan Carol Anderson win a journalism contest and are sent to the Final Four basketball games. They are required to write an article every day that they are at the tournament and are provided press passes and full access to all the inside information.The first day that Steven and Susan are at the games they overhear someone make a blackmail threat to a Minnesota State University player. At first they don't think much of it until a player goes MISSING! You follow the story of the pair putting the puzzle pieces together and solving the mystery of the missing basketball player.I loved the fast pace of the book, the thrilling moments, and the hostage situation. This is the first book in a four book series. And even though this book is about sports, and I'm a girly-girl, this book is awesome! Anyone can enjoy this book!Reviewed by: Taylor Rector"
4,Bball Mystery,"I love everything I've read by Mr Feinstein. While this is not in the class of ""Season..."" or ""Good Walk..."", it wasn't meant to be. It's a good book for a young adult audience that may not be interested in reading. If you have a son or daughter that likes sports but does not like to read this well written mystery about the Final Four may catch their interest."
4,An Amazing Read,"I loved The Last Shot. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I read it. I also really admire the character, Susan Carol Anderson,she was just so outgoing. She also didn't care about what other people thought. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to read it."
2,Needs to come up with his own idea,"When I heard about this book it sounded very familiar to one written a couple years ago called The Fix. I'm not saying the author plagarized, but his story was a takeoff of The Fix, a story about the Mafia fixing the Final Four. Anyhow, he needs to stick with writing non-fiction. His fiction skills are shallow. He did a great job with Season on the Brink, but this book doesn't come close to a good read."
1,New spin on old story!!,"I've liked most of Feinstein's stories, especially A Good Walk Spoiled, but this book doesn't compare. And I can't believe he got away with pulling from another book. Obviously the writer was under pressure to perform. There was a book a couple years ago that reminded me of this one, Jeff Schneider's book about the mob getting to a player to throw the Final Four. The Fix, I think. Seemed a lot like this one. But just because I didn't like it doesn't mean he won't produce another good one. Feinstein is a good writer, but maybe not in the fiction genre yet."
1,Last shot,a very very boring book every single page has just talk talk talk i picked it up read 2 pages and put it back down
4,Keion's Review of Last Shot by John Feinstein,"If you like a good mystery, this is the book to read. Its about two kids who won a contest to the Final Four tournament with all access passes. While there, they hear that someone is blackmailing a player to lose the game. The blackmailers are people who they actually thought were their friends. From the beginning till the very end this book had suspense so if you like drama, you will love this book."
4,Entertaining read,"Last Shot is a great read for any reluctant readers out there, especially those that are more interested in sports. The story involves a mystery and subsequent blackmailing of collegiate basketball player while at the final four. The main character, Stevie, along with his new friend, Susan Carol, must figure out what's going on before the National Title Game. This book would make a great addition to any classroom library and would also be an excellent choice for anyone trying to get someone interested in reading. The story moves fairly quickly and it is not overly long so it shouldn't scare readers away. Overall, I highly recommend this book for any middle school aged child."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I Loved this book. IT was so awesome, I love sports and books about sports. This takes sports books to the next level. I would reccommend this book to anybody who loves NCAA basketball."
2,Last Shot Review,"The last Shot by John Feinstein has its up and downs. This book is about two 14 year olds, Stevie Thomas and Susan Carol Anderson, who win the U.S. Basketball Writers Association contest. The prize is every true basketball fans dream; a trip to the Final Four! Not only do they get press passes for the whole tournament, but also get to attend the press conferences and the chance to meet some players and coaches. You can only imagine their excitement about their great fortune. What they find, is a game very different happening off the court from what is seen on the court.I found this story to be quite interesting, but also felt as if the story was streching the possibility of what the two of them accomplished together. Although I thought the book showed great teamwork and had a nice story, I would not reccomend it to you."
3,Middle School Adventure,"As an experienced middle school teacher, I found Last Shot to be a solid, if somewhat old-fashioned, mystery that should be recommended to all middle school students, most definitely adolescent sports fans, who may be reluctant readers. The plot includes enough suspense and suspicion to captivate the reader, yet is free of harsh profanity and other objectionable material that is so abundant in today's young adult fiction.Especially refreshing are the two main characters, who will stop at nothing to 'right the wrongs' they've encountered on their unique adventure. They demonstrate intelligence,motivation,and resourcefulness in their mission to out-wit a few loathsome characters in the NCAA arena. Last Shot is an easy read and worth the time."
4,A Great Surprise,"Stevie Thomas, an aspiring sports journalist,wins a writing contest and is given a chance to report on the final four championship. Along with his co-winner, the beautiful, witty, and tall, Susan Carol. As they explore the corners of the huge superdome, they overhear MSU's star player, Chip Graber, being blackmailed to throw the championship game against Duke. They later find that it is caused by a faulty transcript. Stevie and Susan Carol are smart and young journalists who finds the clues to this great mystery that is filled with twists. I enjoyed this book a lot even though mysteries aren't exactly my style."
4,ok book,"book was as expected, but I found it slightly slanted politically. more words and more words .three more words. one"
3,Desparate to get someone back?,Sounds like these selections are for someone who is looking to get someone back in their life!!!
3,Nice Wooden Toy with A Few Problems,"I loved this toy when I saw. What's not to love: school bus, wooden and a shape sorter.But as soon as we opened this toy, my son grabbed one of the shapes and started pulling the stickers off. He also gets his fingers smashed as he puts in the shapes for some reason. The wooden toys are nice because they are durable but that also means if your child throws his toys like mine do, its dangerous. He smashed his toe bad. Just a few things to think about.It is a very nice made toy. I also like that he can take the shapes out over and over again. He also has a shape sorter that is a plastic ball and once he puts the shapes in, he has to come to me and get me to open the ball so he can put the shapes in again. This does have double duty, my son likes to drive the bus around and make motor noises."
4,Son loves this bus!,"I bought this for my son's B-Day when he turned one. He is now 13 month's old and he enjoys pulling the shapes out and trying to put them back in. He does get a shape in by himself occasionally. It is one of his favorite toys. He plays with it all the time.It was on sale for around $6.50 when I bought it, so I think I got a great deal."
2,It reeks,I don't know why I didn't smell this stuff in the store before I bought it. I should have. It didn't smell that strong going onto my face (I used it as a cleanser) but a few minutes after rinsing my face the odor was overpowering. I scrubbed my hands and arms and that helped a little but I didn't dare wash my face again since it was already pretty dried out and I didn't want to make it worse. Fragrance shouldn't be so strong in a face wash that I feel like I've been hosed in cheap perfume after I use it. It is the morning after now and my skin looks fine but there is no way I am using this stuff again. My pillow still smells like it. I am probably going to have to wash it in white vinegar to get the smell out and that is total nonsense. If you love the way it smells this product will be great for you but personally I cannot imagine using this stuff on a regular basis.
4,Good scrub,This wash was purchased for my wife. She loves it and says that her face feels so fresh and clean after using it. Thank you for fast shipment.
5,Great Price,"Been using this product for years, finally found it on Amazon and I can subscribe and save even more!!!So glad I thought to look on Amazon."
2,ok product,"I have sensitive skin so I thought the 3.5% BP wouldn't irritate my skin as much as Oxy's 10%. This cleanser didn't help with my acne nor did it make it worse. I liked that it had menthol in it so it gives a cooling affect as you cleanse. I also notice my skin was turning pale, almost white, so it's a little disturbing to have a white face and tan body. So I agree that BP does bleach the skin."
3,Worked okay but really dried my skin,"I used this cleanser primarily for acne control, and in that regard it worked pretty well. I never had any significant breakouts while using it and it did help clear up some of the zits I already had. I also liked the liquid itself -- it was thin but not soupy and it was easy to apply and rinse off.The reason that I stopped using it was because it made the skin on my cheeks and nose really dry and tight. It was so bad that even after I stopped using this wash, it took a week of applying and reapplying heavy-duty moisturizer before my skin finally returned back to normal. I know that dryness can be a side effect of benzoyl peroxide but I had previously tried several stronger BP washes without having this problem, so clearly there is something different in this cleanser that is particularly drying."
1,"Burned, Irritated, and Redness! Don't use unless you wanna look like The Sith!","I've been using Neutrogena products since I was a teenager, and I've never had a complaint about their product until now.I used this Clear Pore Cleanser/Mask crap; and when I first applied it to half of my face it tingled a bit which I thought was normal. I finished applying this crap to the rest of my face and within seconds my face was burning like heck!! I immediately washed this cleanser off with luke warm water and it was still irritating and burning. I've never felt this before, but I thought someone poured acid on my face that's how much it burned. When I looked into the mirror I thought I was looking at the Sith from Star Wars. My face stayed red for hours!!!!I wouldn't use this particular product again, I will stick with my other mask cleanser."
4,Good product Visibly clear in 1week,"Good PRoduct... worked well for me... face clear in a weekMy dad bought me Neutrogena visibly in England a few years ago which i didn't use much cause my clearasil did the trick for me. anyway out of the blue i started having serious breakouts, like i never had before at age 27 long past puberty, despite the use of faithful clearasil. so i tried the tube of neutrogena 2 in1 mask sitting for years on my dresser and to my surprise my face was visibily clear in a week. then it finish and to my dismay i couldn't find it anywhere on the web for purchase but on amazon.uk who won't ship to the US, and my despair continuedTo the point....... I purchase this product and yes! it worked same product differnt name and package.Works well atleast for me. recommendedshippment was a few days later but seller responded in quick time to my enquiry"
3,room for improvement,"i have sensitive skin with minor acne. this product did clear up my skin but the menthol is definitely an irritant. many cosmetic companies use menthol in their products to give consumers a tingly feeling that they might interpret at ""working"" but you don't need to feel it! the menthol and perfume in the product do nothing to clear/nourish the skin, and i believe the product would be much better with out it. not to mention that the menthol makes my eyes water when i use the product as a mask."
3,acne medicine,One of the packages i received in the mail had a broken lid. the other one was fine. i like the product as I've used it before.
1,I couldn't rate this a zero and still register a complaint.,"My wife has been using this product on and off for the last few months, and tonight, it has caused her face to turn sunburn-red in a mask shape all over her face. We have an important holiday function tomorrow night, and we will be unable to attend with her face looking like this. I would call Neutrogena and complain, but apparently people can only have allergic reactions between 8 am and 8 pm Monday through Friday. That I have to wait until Monday morning to scream at their customer service number is frustrating, to say the least. Neutrogena has ruined an event that my wife and I have anticipated for several months."
5,Particularly appropriate reading for health care activists,"Nurses Know! What Happened To Health Care? What Can We Do About It? by Dr. Edward Pallette ( a general surgeon with forty years of experience in the medical field) is a starkly compelling guide specifically written for those wishing to take charge of their health care before it is too late. From becoming an informed voter to spotting the telltale warning of and protecting oneself from medical fraud, Nurses Know! goes beyond the vast expertise of hardworking professional nurses to educate the reader against medical pitfalls he or she may not have guessed existed. Strongly recommended reading, Nurses Know! is particularly appropriate reading for health care activists and consumers in this modern era of health care crises."
2,Great Drills but no detailed instructions,He just doesn't spend enough time breaking down the moves.
3,Wrestling Essentials,"Provides good basic drills, but was hoping for more advanced step by step wrestling move instructions."
3,"An Interesting book, if dated","This book was written at the tail-end of several African wars, including the guerrilla efforts against South Africa and the ongoing struggle in Rhodesia. Some Americans, many of whom had practical experience in Vietnam, volunteered for duty as mercenaries and this book is written as narrative accounts of them, as well as Americans who fought in Israel, served in the French Foreign Legion in Djibouti or trained fighters in Nicaragua. A good book, but it seems out of place today."
1,misleading advertisement,"I am a dj from the chicago area and i am faithfully seeking all old school chicago house music. As all real dj's know, you can't use a cd that has already been mixed by another dj. When I purchased Trax 20th anniversary cd there was no indication that the tracks listed were already mixed. This cd is totally useless to me. There should be some sort of indication letting the consumer know if the track listing is mixed or individual tracks."
3,"Decent, better than depends","I still had to put a baby diaper inside this one to make it not leak and it did not hold up just by itself, but its better than attends or depends which need to put 2 baby diapers in them. I wish diaper companies would make diapers for handicapped people the same way they make the baby diapers for babies, to soak enough up to not leak or bunch or fall off."
2,Has been overrated. Don't buy without comparing...,"This is a seriously old-fashioned and out of date book. It was published around 1972 and EVEN THEN was knocked out of contention by the massively superior Misner, Thorne & Wheeler treatise and by Hawking and Ellis' ""Large Scale Structure of S.T."" - both published at the same time. Weinberg is by nature a quantum theorist and is here writing outside his home territory and it shows. The laborious tensorial notation is unintuitive, dense and reminiscent of fifties textbooks. The treatment is stale and uninspiring (Eddington's ""Mathematical Theory of R."" written in 1922 has more sparkle!). Add to this Robert M. Wald's classic 1985 GR book (Univ. Chicago Press) and Weinberg's treatment simply isn't in the running. Do not rush into buying on other recommendations without comparing it with Misner etc., Hawking etc. and Wald."
3,The Pages are falling out,"bought this book when it was new. I read it for the next 35 years. He uses units that are confusing and hard to calculate. He gives a really bad explanation of groups in one of the first chapters. He never covers weak fields in any meaningful manner. In other words for a classic by one of the greatest geniuses of our time, it is pretty bad. But there is no one except Weyl and Einstein who actually do this stuff as well! I've cursed him for 35 years and came back again and again..."
5,Amazon is attributing this book to the wrong author,"This is to alert the reader to the fact that Amazon is mistakenly attributing this book to the wrong writer. The author of this early work, ""Gravitation and Cosmology,"" was, of course, Steven Weinberg (no middle initial), who is also the author of the recent ""Cosmology,"" and the three-volume treatise on ""The Quantum Theory of Fields,"" as well as several books for the general reader."
3,Ancient and Obsolete,"The beauty of general relativity (GR) lies in the connection it provides between geometry and physics. Weinberg's algebraic approach completely obscures this connection. Instead Weinberg teaches how to crank through complex calculations without any insight or geometric intuition. It is a fairly good book when compared to Misner-Thorne-Wheeler (another ancient text). However, by modern standards, Weinberg's book leaves much to be desired. Having been published in 1972, the book lacks modern examples in cosmology and quantum gravity. It also lacks a proper introduction to differential geometry and makes no mention of topology or other mathematical ideas prevalent in current GR research. In the 35 years since its publication, it has been surpassed by many much better books. For an excellent introduction to GR, read Carroll's book. For a more rigorous study of GR read Wald's book. For an easy introduction to GR, read Schutz's book."
5,The best introduction to Beckett,"If you've never heard of Beckett, this is the first thing you should check out. Richard Seaver's introduction is an added bonus, which helps us understand Beckett even more. All in all, a fabulous book."
1,"Sorry, but ...","I have always thought this band was terrible. I'm sorry they had to go through the horrible tragedy of having their singer murdered, but the music itself is heinous. You can rarely understand the lyrics, and the music makes me wanna plunge letter openers into my eardrums. It sounds like a screaming, sloppy drunk."
3,Budget card for legacy systems,"Got one of these used to replace the dying ATI x700 card on my old XP box. Not a high end gaming card by any stretch. AGP card with dual VGA outputs and S-Video out, 256MB V-RAM. Check nVidia for the latest drivers."
4,An early Bar 20 series,"One of the earlier of the Bar 20 or Hopalong Cassidy series, and one of my favorites.Glad to find a copy!"
5,IT REALLY DOES a great job,"we have had this grill for a bout 2 weeks it really cooks well with almost no flare up, this a real winner. THIS IS OUR 1ST CHARBOIL GRILL, THE OTHER ONE WE HAD, YOU REALLY HAD TO BABY SET IT SO YOU WOULDN'T BURN UP YOUR FOOD BECAUSE OF FLARE/UPS IF I EVER HAVE TOO REPLACE THIS GRILL I'LL HAVE TO GET ME ANOTHER CHAR.BROIL PERFORMANCE SERIES ,,,,, WAY TO GO CHAR-BROIL ,,,,,,,,BEST GRILL ON THE MARKET"
3,good primer to start learning FEWL,"i got the DVD as free gift from something else i bought. the presentation is very entertaining and informative, and certainly gives very clear instruction on how to combine Elliot Wave counts with Fibonacci retracement/extension/projection to ""pinpoint"" specific entry and exits. it is 73mins (not 90mins) and very basic. i would recommend it for someone who doesn't believe in Elliot Wave or Fibonacci and hasn't researched their use in chart trading. but for experienced traders, it's expensive for a short video presentation of ""... this is how i practice it everyday"". books (while cheaper) might be more informative but harder to get through Chapter1 compared to Todd's lively presentation, so i give it 3 stars."
3,Less than what I expected,"It gave me a good feel for the psychology of Elliott Wave theory, but it was short on instruction. If you watch it many times, you can use it for some specific instruction but it is not user friendly. In hindsight, I would read an Elliott Wave book first."
3,not bad,"It was not what I was expecting, it is just a videoconference nevertheless the information is usefull."
1,Don't Consent To This Treatment!,"Eighties retro may be a decent enough idea if it's done with style and taste - unfortunately Blue October has neither. The lead singer is a Peter Gabriel wannabee whose voice is so grating it only sounds bearable when put through some kind of phase shifter effect like they do on most of the album. Can you say pretentious and affected? How about topping it off with the most clichèd songwriting this side of Spinal Tap. Sad thing is, this band is serious! My suggestion for those who insist on purchasing this CD - take a few Motrin first. Halfway through I had a splitting headache."
1,worse than Smashmouth,"This is one of the worst albums in the history of recorded music. The lyrics are nonsense. Justin has the worst voice I've ever heard, and the entire band must be tonedeaf. It's like Dave Matthews gone bad, and Dave Matthews is horrible."
5,"good stuff, eh","Good stuff, this. I only recently stumbled rather unwittingly into this band, and well, whaddayaknow, i like this. Still not too sure what to make of the opening track: comic? serious? waxing philosophic? all of the above? Desparation creates a unique sense of humour. Track 2,(Independantly Happy) however, i love. HRSA and Drop gives me goosebumps, and Breakfast after 10, my introduction to them, is very solid. That's the best word i can figure for that one. Just damn good, and solid- hell, that's the whole album. The lyrics tend to be more melancholy than not, if that's your bag, great; the music, however, regardless, is certainly worth noting. The whole album is worth listening to--go ahead and just leave in the cd player for a long while. Check these guys out, chances are you won't be dissappointed. (And, if you are, fear not, someone else will probably buy it from you.)"
5,Finally...The Release of a Long Awaited Album!,"First, let me say if you do not have the album YET.....get it, listen to it, and you will understand why I feel the way I do about this CD and about this band!Blue October is no doubt one of the hottest...if not the hottest band to hit the Music Scene in 2000. This CD is composed full of power and poetry combined with raging sounds of art rock! Their edgy modern rock will keep you listening through the whole CD and wanting even more after 14 tracks!!In closing let me say if you can go and see Blue October live and I guarantee that after the concert you will go straight to your local music store and will end up walking out with Consent to Treatment in your hand!!!"
4,Another Great CD,"Justin's lyrics pretty much make this band as good as they are. This is a very personal creation for Justin. He uses his past ""struggles"" with life to make a wonderful CD, but you really have to listen to this band to understand what they are doing. They are a phenom on the brink of stardom, and this album proves it. Give it a listen and appreciate all that Justin has been through and the courage it takes to write music about it. They are one of the best bands to make it out of the 90's."
3,THIS IS NOT the blue october I thought it was!,"if you are going to buy this CD,and have or like the Blue October CD's ""Incoming"" and ""lies to the righteous"" ,you are going to be dissapointed.they are two different bands!this Blue October is a rock band,not bad just different!other reviewer comments are accurate."
4,All around good CD,"This is a good CD all around. I herd ""JAMES"" on the radio and bought the CD. The other songs are good listen to the words from the songs you will enjoy it more."
5,Blue October Rocks!!!,I think this is an awesome CD. I am a huge Blue October fan. I love Justin's voice and lyrics. I also love Ryan on the violin. Come on this band has to rock they have a violinist.
3,Just OK music from a great band,"I am a big fan of Blue October. I am 35 and my younger brother who is 30 got me hooked. The first album I heard from Blue October was Foiled and I love it. Since I bought History for Sale and then The Answer. Last was this album. It is much different in terms of sound and theme from the other albums. It is OK. If you like Foiled you will find this album difficult to like. The songs are not as complex, dark or deep, however you want to say it. I am not a depressive person, but Blue October has a somewhat sad and then hopeful theme to their music. This album just does not have it. Go for Foiled or The Answer for your first taste of Blue October."
2,Pontes fan disappointed,"I have listened in amazement to Pontes pushing the boundaries of fado and folk genres on her prior CDs with her unique delivery and fantastic voice. Here she leaves those boundaries behind and goes off into Celine Dion territory--show off all your technical ability and the entire extent of your range in every single song. Kind of exhausting. On the other hand, if you like fireworks in every song, this one's for you."
4,Kid's book,My grandson will like the idea that he could teach his dog some words. He will probably try to do just that.
5,Super cute book,"My kiddos never get tired of hearing this story. The illustrations are cute, and the book is fun to read aloud. Great for bedtime or story time!"
5,Simply marvelous!,"This is a classic. Funny lines, great rhymes and rhythm, engaging pictures, and an appealing main character. If a parent loves to read it as much as a toddler loves to hear it, that's the sign of a great book."
2,Teaching a Dog,"This was not the book I was expecting in the mail but I flipped through it anyway. It was a fun kids book that if I had kids, would have been useful to me.Make sure you get what you really want.... know the author! My mistake but this one was cute, also."
1,My mistake,I didn't realize this was the children's book in the Dr. Seuss series. I thought it was for adults. My mistake and I had to laugh at myself when I excitedly opened it up. I couldn't teach my dog any new tricks! :)
3,Technology at its simplest.,"I have to admit, I am not technologically inclined but after reading this book, anyone can understand DVD video. I learned much and it made me think further about purchasing the whole DVD setup."
5,Billy Childs is Brilliant!,"I consider Billy Childs one of the greatest living jazz composers. So much music is contrived, rather than composed these days.Billy is an amazing jazz craftsman."
5,Gorgeous,"This is a very beautiful, very reflective piece of writing by Billy Childs. While the track ""Scarborough Faire"" might garner the most attention (and gained the most airplay), all the other tracks also display Childs' penchant for fine craftsmanship, intricate piano work, and superbly-woven ensemble music. As another reviewer mentioned, Childs' piano style also reminds me of a quiet Keith Emerson (from the ""take a pebble"" days), as well as the mellower side (when it came out) of McCoy Tyner. But the overall musical structures in which his piano is a part are intricate, wholly up to date, and immensely appealing.Highly recommended, if and when yo can find this. Also look for ""Take for example this, one of his earliest albums and (I still think) one of his best.Take for Example This"
2,LOW QUALITY LAMP,The lamp shade had two problems--seam coming apart for 2 inches and puckering in another area. It seems that they don't check the quality before shipping it out.
1,looks cheap,"cheap looking , thin metal plate. nuts that were supposed to go over screws did not fit securely, leaving exposed threads. did not bother leaving it up, very disappointed."
3,"Very nice looking product, quality could be better","The product looks great and overall I'm happy with it. However, the hardware that comes with it is very cheap. I recommend taking your own wall plugs and replacing the ones that come with the lamp. The wall mount has 6 holes and they only provide enough screws to fill 4."
3,Teri,This is just what I wanted to replace another pin up light in my kitchen. I was disappointed in the workmanship. The swing arm was not quite square attached to the back plate and the arms don't look straight. I have to keep adjusting the shade to make it look like it is straight.
1,just spreading hate,I've read the response to this book and it made me realise that moshay's book is just full of bulls*** and spreading hate in Nigeria.
5,This can't be happening!,"This isn't some happy-go-lucky book that gives you the warm fuzzies. That's what makes it so great. You don't know what's going to happen next, and when it happens you're saying ""This can't be happening! She can't do that!"" Yet with all the plot, Lisa Bergren still is able to weave in a powerful message about Jesus Christ."
5,AWESOME,This was the first book I have read by this author but I was hooked from page 1. I felt like I was right among the people in this book--following their daily lives. I was sad when it ended! I wanted to read more.
2,"Good materials, competent writing, bad book","Maybe I shouldn't be reviewing a book I didn't finish, but I did read about half of it: Perhaps the first third, and the last several chapters.There's an interesting integration of fantasy and sf, a lot of the dialog and incident is fun, the characters are interesting, but it just doesn't work as a whole. I've concluded that the problem is a nearly unbroken string of characters making bad decisions in unpleasant circumstances and learning nothing from the results.Spoiler alert (two, three, four, stop reading already if you want to . . .): I didn't even find the scene fairly near the beginning where a character lays down his life for his friends to be stirring--and ordinarily a writer still in middle-school can be guaranteed that I'll weep over his or her treatment of THAT theme!"
3,They look cheaper than the picture,"The picture has the curtain rings looking cool, frosted, kinda sophisticated. In actuality they are just some plain, clear, cheap looking shower curtains rings. They are slightly thick, but when I used the latching piece to push through, it went through the hole much easier. They don't slip off and they hold my curtain up perfectly. When the rings catch the light a certin way, they kinda give off a slight frosted look, but nowhere near the picture displayed on Amazon. So if you are looking to buy them on appearance, I would not recommend these rings. If you are looking for functionality they work fine.Update:glad they changed the pic."
4,"Not exactly what I wanted, but still good.","I was under the impression that these rings locked together, but they, in fact, do not. Despite this, they still do their job. The rings haven't separated at all and my shower curtain remains attached to the shower curtain rod. Can't complain about that."
3,Sort of Repetetive...,"The new song is pretty awesome. The remixes leave a bit to be desired, and considering the album version and the single version are practically the same... I wouldn't really spend the money on it, unless you're collecting their CD's or something. Like any single, it's the same song over and over again... I suggest you grab the new CD instead!"
4,Gift for a friend,I got this as a gift for my friend who is obsessed with Nietzsche (Her first tattoo was a quote by him) and she loved it.
2,A bit dated.,"The wisdom will stand the turning of the tides, but the concepts are dated, and most of us are not 4'10"" and therefore could not possibly sail around the world in a 25' boat."
3,classic study guide,"This is a classic study guide. It is, however, too short to provide a clear understanding of this complex book in the Bible. I would recommend Revelation: Four Views : A Parallel Commentary by Steve Gregg and Revelation by Craig Keener for further study."
3,Okay,"I have taught a read the entire Bible in a year class several times. The approach to studying Revelation is sound. Seldom would say this because I love books on my Kindle, but wish I had a hard copy of this one."
5,The best translation of Dashkova's life.,"This is one of the few books that is all in one, not two parts. I wish it were a hardback copy, but, such is life. One of the most fascinating women who is often overlooked in history. The first female president of RAS (The Russian Academy of Sciences) and best friend to Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia. Ironically, these two women had the same first names. Dashkova came from a long line of aristocracy. She was probably the Empresses' most closest companion and adviser and a forerunner for the emancipation of women. The book has a lengthy introduction which should never have been there and can be totally ignored, in fact, it is pointless to read that part. It is a memoir, why have a forward. If you want to know more about the background, read The History of Russia in XVII & XVIII centuries. A must read."
3,Meh,"The packaging is cute. The orange slices are cute too. Unfortunately, my piggies just ignore them."
1,waste of money,"My guinea pig hardly touches these. He is happier eating a fresh orange than this. Save your money, because there are only about 5 slices in the bag and you could get 5 whole fresh oranges for the same price."
3,Treats,This is just a treat for my guinea pigs. They would rather have fesh fruit but they will eventually chew on these.They need the added Vitamin C but it seems they would rather have green peppers. Maybe they're too sweet.
3,two paws down,"Bunny does not like this item, actually, it was pretty funny, when she bit it, she spit, as if to say that it was too sour, it's a nice item but she didn't like it. She would rather have a rasin or an apple. oh well, live and learn"
5,Tasty Treats,I purchased these treats for my 2 piggies because I'd been looking for healthy treats and these fit the bill. They are very healthy and my guinea pigs love them! Plus it provides them with vitamin C. My only complaint is that it only comes with 5 slices in a pack :/
1,Great idea but the pig won't eat them,"I got some of these to provide more C for the pig as well as variety. Well it's been about two weeks since I put one in his cage and he hasn't touched it. I'm not sure what to make of that, but there it is."
4,A Great Help,"As a business consultant and coach, I am always searching for new questions to ask and approaches. This book was very helpful in providing a few new questions and a few new wrinkles. Have no regrets about having purchased it and will refer to it again on occasion."
5,Excelentum,"Yes! This is absolut brilliant DVD! Hightly will this recomendet to all of Jazz Music Lovers!Also like I wright here before, all of performers are fascinent & movie quality to!But better U not see the frogs in U'rs sleepy times!Greetings from Tartu, Estonia!Grix"
5,Music From A Jazz fusion Legend,"I have been waiting for a CD of this since vinyl became obsolete. I have loved this for many years reason: Pharoah Sanders's sax, Norman Connors production and the immortal vocals from the late Phyllis Hyman. The song ""As you are"" is probably in my opinion her best vocals and she has had many. Some critics complained about the album being too commercial considering his background but I saw it as a transition while maintaining his artistic vision. Thank you for making me a very happy man with this purchase. The delivery was extremely fast. I recommend this seller."
3,A bit disappointing,"Well honestly I bought this game because I was looking for a game that would be a Tetris equivalent. It is not. If you are looking for Tetris...Don't buy this. From the picture on the box I thought it would be, but don't be fooled. If you like bright flashy lights and techno music...you might like this game. All you do is drop squares made of 2 different colors on eachother...The point is to get a box of the same color, so it can disappear. So yeah...needless to say it was definately disappointing for me. So I thought I would let everyone else know, just incase they were like me and searching for a Tetris type game for the Playstation 2 console."
2,"Beautiful to look at, terrible to use as a guide","I bought this book on the premise that the projects would be inspiring, well planned, and beautiful. One out of three is bad.The projects were indeed beautiful, but I found them to be complicated, not well documented and entirely difficult for the average crafter to recreate. I found the projects in Creating Handmade Books by Alisa Golden and Bookworks by Sue Dogget much more approachable and desirable.I'd borrow this book from the library rather than buy it--nice to look at, but completely unusable."
3,Not for the beginning book artist...,"I agree that the projects and samples in this book are gorgeous and inspiring, but I wouldn't recommend buying this book unless you already have some bookmaking experience. I'm a beginner, and this book doesn't explain how to assemble signatures, etc. They just assume you already know bookbinding techniques. I recommend Cover to Cover for a good description of how to do basic techniques, and this book for the intermediate book maker who wants to make some beautiful art."
3,Classic Toy,"Great for new walkers, makes lots and lots of noise and is very durable. Kids will enjoy it for a short time, but is a great addition (cheap too) to your toy box."
4,fun toy,"I recently bought this for my 2 boys (ages 4 and almost 1). They both loved it from the moment it came out of the box! In the month that we have had this toy, I can't tell you what they have put this thing through. They have used and abused this toy all day every day, and it looks brand new. The only thing I don't like about it is that it's loud! When you pull it along, it's loud as the balls on the inside spin around. I think that's part of the appeal to my boys, anything annoying is always a bonus to kids! Overall I would reccomend this toy."
3,Doesn't quite pull its weight,"These pull toys are popular and priced right, but I have yet to see one exert an appeal on the little tyke equal to its attraction on the well-intentioned adult. The string is so short that demonstrating the use of the item is a pain. At least this one has an especially wide stance, which should help it to stay rightside-up. Nevertheless, my tyke was dragging it upside-down on the first try--20 feet on the sidewalk, and the whole plastic dome was irreparably scratched. I doubt the abrasions matter to the child as much as to the adult. She never looked back at the toy the whole time she was pulling it."
3,Disappointed/expected too much,"I bought these for myself needing a full sole shoe rather quickly. I am an adult who bought 8m considering that is my street size. My feet to be average with occassional slippage in heel area. For that I did expect to have minimal fit problems but the heel strap & sides are way too big. The sides particularly gap which makes it annoying/unsightly. I would recommend bloch's danshoz over these in my opinion. Such a shame too, these are cute."
5,great shoe,"I cant believe how easy it is to purchase these shoes without driving all over the place. They fit great, look great and saved me time."
2,too wide,I've owned a bunch of Capezio ballet/dance shoes in my life and never before have they been such a wide fit! Anything to do with the fact that they are made in Taiwan??? Save these for the store when you can try them on! Super disappointed :(
3,Not true to size,"The quality of the shoes seem fine. The color is ballet pink which is different from pastel pink so I found the color to be as I expected. However, the size is vastly different from street shoe size. I purchased them for my grand daughter who has a very narrow foot. I ordered size 3N which is 1/2 size larger than her street shoes she could not get her foot into the shoe. I ordered a second pair size 4 1/2N which fit perfectly. I did not have an option for exchange. I was unhappy with having to order another pair ship back the too small pair and wait for a credit to my credit card. Wish I had ordered from Zappos where shipping both ways is free and includes overnight shipping. Shoes cost only about $3.00 more at Zappos but would have been better in the long run."
1,awful.,"fits too tight in the toe, and flared out in the middle. returned them for a refund. Not what I expected at all.."
2,very wide,They look really cheap and very wide did not stay close to the foot. I kept them because i could find another one in my childs size. The length is true to size but the width is really wide.
4,pretty shoes,"Great service from Amazon as always. The shoes are sweet, comfortable, and the inner lining is so pretty. The only issue I found was that they are bigger than expected. I had to exchange for a smaller size and the sides of the shoes still hang off my feet rather than sitting snug, but for the price, not a bad shoe."
2,not what was expecting,when I opened the box and examined the shoes I wasn't expecting the leather at the tip of the shoe to be so bunched up. I can feel the rolls of leather under my toes as I dance. when trying to tighten the strings the one on the leftside on both shoes was glued in place. had to pull very hard to loosen and was afraid would pull the still right out. I will only use these till my new shoes arrive then these will collect dust in the back of my closet.
2,Very Wide,"These shoes were extremely wide and had too much fabric around the heel. Although the color was pretty, they unfortunately looked too sloppy to keep."
3,Not Pink,It is pretty good in general but the colour in definitely not pink. It is like skin colour so it didn't match the Leotard and the skirt which I ordered for my little child from Capezio also.
3,Ballet SHoes,"When I ordered the shoe I thought it was a good value. When we received them, they were the correct size but they were felt cheap and are way too wide. I think we are going to have to have the sides stitched so they will fit a lot more snug."
3,fair stuff,I was happy when I received it the next day after I ordered it but it turned out not that comfortable as canvass slippers. It is the first time I'd tried leather slippers. But I think it will last a long time.
5,DO NOT FOLLOW REVIEWS THAT SAY ORDER A FULL SIZE UP,"I followed a lot of people review that said you had to order a size up because they ran small - IT'S NOT TRUE. I just had to return mine because they were OBVIOUSLY too big.I'm a 7.5 N foot. I ordered an 8.5 W N like people suggested, but it was too big. I'm debating now on buying either a 7.5 or an 8. I say buy your street size and go from there so you can tell EXACTLY how to proceed.The shoes themselves came quickly and were so beautiful, so sad I have to wait for my refund to process before I can get the proper shoe..."
1,Horrible fit,"This ballet slipper is a very poorly designed shoe. The vamp ( or top front) of shoe is way too long. Comes half way over my foot! The fabric is cheap and horrible. Even after tightening the lace, the shoe buckles and gaps. I grew up in the ballet shoe business and this ballet slipper was never like this. A ballet slipper should always fit like a glove for the foot. It's designed to protect the dancer's foot and should never be noticed. These are definitely going back ASAP!"
2,Too big! Size way off.,Sizing is off. I ordered my size 7.5 and they are way too big. I should have ordered the 6.5 which I never wear. The cost of shipping them back for the correct size was too much. I ended up keeping them even though they just sit on my shelf.
4,size is accurate,I ordered these for my daughter who wears a size 9 1/2. After reading all the reviews I ordered her a size 10 and they were too large. I should have gone with her regular shoe size. Great shoes though.
3,Kay,I purchased these shoes for my 10 year old daughter. The leather is very good however the cut is very small and therefore does not fit.
1,Not the book I was expecting,I had high hopes for this book based on many of the reviews here. This was not the book I was expecting. I was looking forward to reading a well written piece of fiction (or really 13 small works) telling the tales of President Lincoln and people he came in contact with during the Civil War. Instead what I ended up reading was an appalling work of trash. This book had been chosen as a book club selection for a small history museum and all members agreed that this was not a book any one enjoyed. In fact many were offended and embarrassed by it. I would not recommend reading this book.
1,Read It and Roll Your Eyes,"Having just read a biography of Lincoln, I really welcomed this book. Immediately disappointed, I was dismayed because the author always seemed to take the easy way around the stories, by using modern obscenities, which made me think he didn't put a whole lot of thought into it. Whenever there was a choice, his fictionalized characters usually opted for sordid behavior, with few exceptions and it just wasn't believable. A waste of time."
3,On the Fence,"This book is actually a series of short stories connecting on Abraham Lincoln's presidency during the Civil War. While there were some really intriguing stories, others dragged on. But for history buffs who like imamgination thrown in, this would be an interesting read."
1,Gimmickry without merit,"These are stories built around an idea, nothing more. There is no sense of Lincoln apart from his height. I also found the subject matter of the stories and the dialogue to be too anachronistic to be credible. And the writing never goes beyond serviceable. A major disappointment."
1,I put it down and I love Civil War/Lincoln novels,"The sudden and unnecessary graphic passages, intended for ""shock value"", ruined the prose for me. There are too many other books that I want to read, so I put this one down. There's a reason it has a discounted price right now. It's not a good book."
1,Adam Braver has a deranged mind.,This book was a huge disappointment to read. Talk about hitting rock bottom! I can't even keep this book in my house because of all the negativity emitting from it. The language is terrible and the sexual scenes are offensive to say the least. Why Mr. Braver had to take such an obnoxious approach to descirbe the emotional conditions of the times is beyond me. I can't believe he would dedicate the book to his grandfather. This is NOT a book you would desire your grandparents to read.
1,Pure Agony,"I quote, ""It can seem as if the ony thing to make it better would be a quick stick of morphine into the veins and a skeleton key twisted in the lock, leaving the flame of a candle as the only other breathing thing in the room; and Abraham Lincoln was the sixteenth president of the United States.""That is the second sentence of Mr Lincoln's Wars. This abuse of punctuation is only the beginning. I can assure you it gets worse.The content itself is horrific and disturbing. Mr Braver work is as distressing to read as Toni Morrison's Beloved. Unfortunately, it lacks the beauty of language that a Morrison book delivers.I can not believe this 'book' ever made it past the slush pile. It is absolutely awful. A great thought (the premise of the book) sometimes never gets past being just a great thought."
1,Simply awful,"What promises to be an insightful look into Lincoln's inner life turns out to be more concerned with all that is sordid in life period. The subject matter throughout the book is disturbing. Too much emphasis is put on people and events of a sick and twisted nature. I did read the entire book, but only because I was looking for something of redeeming value. I didn't find it. I also walked away with no more understanding of Lincoln the man, or the people of the times. Unpleasant waste of time."
1,Seek Another Book,"I found Mr. Lincoln's Wars to be both offensive and uninspiring. The stories are saturated with some of the most offensive and vulgar language, and the constant hurtling of those profanities at the reader becomes quite annoying and tiresome. Mr. Braver serves up some of the crudest descriptions I have been confronted with, and as an independent reviewer, I have read many.Christian writers will certainly be offended by the author's misuse of the Lord's name as an expletive. He allows his fictional characters free reign. The sexually explicit content is also grossly unwelcome and serves no real purpose with relationship to the stories. Readers would do well to invest their money in a different book.If this book is to be, as the quotes on the cover indicate, some new hallmark of literary fiction, then may God help us all. Were there a lower rating than one star I would certainly bestow it upon this piece of work."
3,Mr. Lincoln's Wars,"Mr. Lincoln's Wars, is a book that contains not only a positive side but a negative side as well. I think that the book hit the most important things that were happening in Lincoln's life in that time, and how he came to deal with them. However, that was the only positive side.The negative side is that the book expresses things that I don't think should have been expressed, such as the violence happening in the families lives, and how they all have different ways of ""coping"" with it negatively.Overall, the book was not terrible, but it was not awesome either."
4,"Somewhat dated now, but still very worthy ideas.","First off, the composite authors name is Lapin, not Laping.I used this book back around 1990 to develop a large software suite. The first 5 chapters are an excellent intro to portable C coding. We used the beginning chapters to design and develop our common platform headers, libraries and Make system. We did not take their examples unchanged, but used them as starting points for a our needs, which was a somewhat more comprehensive system. My team gives the book credit for helping us get us some of our 10x improvements. Still have not seen the likes of this book even today, in terms of the quality of data to use.The last half of the book is a summary of different API calls and /bin functions available on different Unixes of the day. Interesting now, from a historical perspective."
5,The romantic 'kiss' only,"This is a tastefully done album on the subject of the 'kiss'. The visual examples are not vulgar. The quotations are a delight and make for enjoyable easy reading. A page- turner.Here are a few examples of the wisdom cited in the book."" A kiss something you cannot give without taking, or take without giving."" ( Anonymous)""Soul meets soul in lover's kisses"" ( Shelley)"" The Universe exists in a kiss, hangs on the hold of a kiss. (Zalman Shneour)The book is without deep or prolonged philosophical consideration of the meaning of different kinds of 'kisses'.The kisses in question are 'romantic kisses' of usually young man and woman.There are not in this book the kisses of a mother for a child, or at the other end of life, the parting kiss at the closing of the eyes of one leaving the world.This book is thus for those whose mind and hearts are in 'romantic love' for the young in spirit primarily."
1,a very disappointing look into a writers mind,I was excited to pick up this book but I could barely finish it. It seems real self indulgent and it's not like Lost Souls was a masterpiece or anything. I wouldn't recemend it to my friends.
3,Investor's Dream,"After reading this book, I went out that day and made $50,000 buying stocks, bonds and real estate. However, I blew it all the next day investing in rare coins and beanie babies. Maybe I should stick to CDs and money market funds.Easy come, easy go."
5,"An invaluable, up-to-date reference","This book, useful for both the novice and the more advanced investor, provides a thorough overview of almost every type of investment (including bonds, annuities, life insurance, etc.) and an comprehensive glossary of investment terms. It is handy when it comes to looking up unfamiliar terms and is an enjoyable overall read. The book also contains a listing of brokerages, banks, etc. with phone numbers and addresses. It is probably the authoritative volume on investing, which is to be expected coming from Barron's. It's definitely well worth it!"
5,Maybe the best investment guide ever written...,"Do you want a book that will naswer all your questions about investing and finance? Then this is the one. Written as a guide, the first section covers over 30 different investment opportunities- from stocks,bonds and futures to real estate, collectables and mutual funds. Each investment description includes risk, tax, economic and liquidity considerations.Other sections include: How To Read A Financial Report, How To Read The Financial Pages and the Dictionary of Finance and Investment. This $25 book well may be one of the best investments a beginner ever makes."
5,useful and valuable,"Being a beginner of an investing guy, this book is very useful for reading any article about economics, investment and finance. You can look up all the specil terms in this one. A perfect handbook!"
4,A great book that could have been stupendous,"I have just finished ""The Swedish Lie"" and am experiencing the grief and regret one feels after closing the cover on a truly fantastic novel. Amy Hillgren Peterson is an extremely talented and thoughtful author who has the ability to breathe life into every character who walks across the pages of his book. I grieve at the thought that I will no longer encounter this colorful cast and regret that I couldn't spend more time with them. Ms. Peterson has woven the experiences of two young Swedish Lovers at the turn of the 1900s, through the struggles of their beloved son through the Depression, the change and rebellion that accompanies the grandson in Rock n Roll of the 1950s and the quandary faced by the postmodern great granddaughter in an age where women have lots of choices but little direction.Funny, touching, moving, all of these things yet I still found myself wanting more."
3,Not great....not bad.,"Shipped fairly quick and was packaged nice. The salmon was ok. Not great or what I would consider better than what you can get at a good food outlet. If you live in a big city with options, then your better of getting it there. One item...they leave the skin on, so the flesh absorbs a lot of the smell and oils from the skin. If you're thinking of gravlox, or fish cured in that manner, this is not for you."
3,Not what I expected,"This was sort of ok salmon, somewhat dry, the shipping was fast though. My dog loved it..."
3,A Good Gift,"We understand from the two recipients that it was delicious and well presented. The only problem with the gifts was there was no indication who had given them. When I placed the order I kept expecting a Gift Card to appear, but suddenly the purchase was complete and gone! Had we not told them about it they never would have known since no name appeared on the label either!"
1,Anybody home?,"I bought this as a Christmas present. You can't track the shipping through Amazon because it's sent from somewhere else. Amazon sent me an email address that I could use to contact the company about the shipment. Despite two emails to Alaska Smokehouse (one over a month ago), I still have no idea if my friends received the salmon. (Yes, I could ask my friends, but it seems tacky.) Free shipping is a great offer...but not if you never actually find out if it happened!"
2,As per usual,"There are some helpful tips in this book but the gist of it only espouses consistent stereotypes- Ms. Ali has made a fortune on pitting black men and women against each other in her books. There are no redeeming qualities that would justify it's purchase except that the title alone will alert women to be careful. I suggest that people desiring to know more about their mate, purchase the set of books by author General Hafeezah, called BEFORE YOU SAY I DO His/Hers- This is the best way I know to determine if your man is GAY or not and a lot of other vital information as well."
4,functional,the service was quick. the gloves work for most hot things but not when gripping iron cast cookware for more than a few seconds.
5,Great gloves.,"Handling wood inside the wood burning stove I cannot feel heat through them. The gloves feel a little big to my hands, but I think this is because they are not broken in yet. I would have liked to see a strap on them to hang on a hook. Red design make them easy to see and find."
5,"Love them, as good as welding gloves","In fact, I suspect these are just a dyed and branded set of good thick arcwelding gloves. I love them because they are thick heavy leather and are super well made. I'd recommend them highly."
1,What a disappointment.,"I am going to return these gloves asap. What a waste of my gift money. They look great and I love Lodge products. They are normally great, but these do not protect me from heat at all. I use cast iron in almost all of my cooking and I can only hold on to the cookware for about 10 seconds. The other night I got a very bad burn when I was moving my skillet from the oven to the stove. That is about 8 feet away."
2,spurral Gloves,"Not has good has said to be, holding something hot like (Cornbread Pan) can get a little hot quickly in your hand than I thought it would"
3,Good until something's really hot!,"I've been using these gloves for the good part of a year now with my indoor oven. They work fine on most things that come out of the oven, however when I use a very hot oven temperature, such as for bread baking in a cast iron dutch oven, the heat comes through. Ouch. I would not buy again. To me they are awkward as well. My daughter has the ""Ov Glove"" type - I really like hers much better and they will handle the extra heat. They are much more user friendly in my opinion."
4,Quality product,"These gloves are heavy-duty and priced right. There is a cloth lining and they fit a man-sized hand easily. Since there's only one pice of leather seperating you from the heat, I think the rating would be 450 dgrees for under 10 seconds. I would have gladly paid more for two or three pieces of leather (like welding gloves have) in the palm area. These are not fireplace gloves so don't try to pickup burning logs. All things considered; I can get the lid off my Lodge Dutch oven without getting burnt -- And that's all I wanted."
4,Pretty good,"Nice Leather gloves, but I could not hold my grill pan too long when picking up from the grill. Great for turning burgers, etc close to the heat."
2,Not good with high heat,"As another reviewer already mentioned, these are not good with high heat. Anything above 400 and you're going to feel it quite quickly. The problem is probably that there's just not enough stuff between your hand and whatever you're picking up. I have a really old oven mitt that works better because it has padding. Perhaps it's just not designed for oven use."
2,Rich and valuable content in contrast with worst layout ever seen,"I borrowed the book from the university library. I would definitively not buy it even for a moderate price, because it is a piece of unfinished work. First, the layout is horrific - imagine a technical handbook printed in the style of a novel and you are there. Second, the content was not condensed, parts of the text, especially some (long!) lists, are repeated in the same chapter (an in other chapters too).This is a great pity because the book has real valuable content, in my opinion. It is the noted down life-time experience of a design engineer. I worked with the book, essentially condensing it, whereby I could extract a lot of practical knowledge unknown to me before."
1,How to publish a soap-tech with a fancy name.,"This is one of the useless books that i have ever seen. You may stand it, and you may tell yourself that ""well, it is a book without content, nothing to tell about 'robust electronics', but has some addresses and notes and references that might be useful. This would be a valid argument in early 80s -and I was a teenager with limited experience then; and there was no Google, no internet, no database access networks.And you would be very much dissappointed when you consider number of ways to spend 430$. I would suggest the publisher to ask advise from respected and reliable editors/ reviewers, before having a book printed."
2,Stickers are not durable enough,"I've not been ""lucky enough"" to have lost an item and had it recovered. I can say though that for any application where there is wear, these stickers just don't last. In addition it is relatively awkward to register the stickers online, and the company makes little effort to keep the feedback loop closed (for example I would welcome a once a year email listing stickers and my address, verifying the protection is still active). Good idea, poor implementation. The stickers also come in a bicycle version... those seem to last a bit longer."
5,An uplifting book on a difficult subject,"When my grandmother was diagnosed terminally ill(suffering from COPD), the family chose hospice care instead of a nursing home. I went to the library to get a book on hospice and this is the book that carried me through the heartbreaking yet beautiful last week of my beloved Nany's life. I know that every dying experience is different, but there were similarities between the author's mother and my grandmother's. It gave me great comfort to read Mr. Brookes words as I sat beside my grandmother's bedside. Many thanks for putting into words what my family and I were observing and feeling."
5,beautiful heartfelt and cathartic,"My beloved father passed away on March 3, 2005 after living for 2 years with Stage IV lung cancer. I was his caretaker for the last 6 weeks of his life whe I moved to New York to care for him. This book is a beautiful heartfelt story of the author's experience with his own's mother's illness and death. I found it to be very cathartic and appreciated the beauty of his words. i even found things within to adapt when writing my dad's eulogy. If only i could write so well to write something beautiful for my father. Thank you Tim Brookes, bless your family and your mother, may she live though you all who loved her so. Lori"
4,"great camera, few problems","Overall this camera is amazing. The only problem is the focus problems that are well documented elsewhere. The mirror fix and firmware upgrade from Canon helped, but there is still a tendency for focus to drift when shooting rapid fire. However, under low light there is not any camera that even comes close to it for quality."
4,The fix is in,"After reading bad reviews on the focus problems with this camera I waited a while to pull the trigger. I shoot sports, equestrian (some indoors), and stage dance. I bought this camera for low light useage, and the superior focus speed. I have not been dissapointed. I use 3200iso when necessary without any worries. My mark3 came from Canon with the latest firmware update already installed. The battery life is incredible, shot 1700 images and still had 40% left. The wait was worth it."
2,Focus Poblems Need Fixed by Canon,"This new model is so good in many ways, yet is unaccepteble in its current form. It has become well known for its terrible focus issues that Canon has yet to be able to fix. Two firmware updates have been issued as a bandaid, but these have not yet fixed the problem.I recommend you hold-off and wait for Canon to officially admit to the problem and name a fix. Yes, this focus problem is that bad. Expect to have 30-50% of your shots out of focus. Canon is investigating this and issuing firmware updates, but have yet to officially comment on it. ""Let's get with it, Canon!!"" Take it from me, you don't want a $5,000 camera that can't focus on STATIONARY objects, let alone, moving ones! Very frustrating!"
2,Canon Buyers Beware,"I have been a loyal Canon user for many years. I own a 30D and the MarkIIID. The Mark IIID was sent back for the recall to address the AF. The work they did to it negatively effected the color balance. It was sent back to the factory. The factory then lost my camera (having shipped it with the wrong FEDEX number). They sent another Mark III. It had back focus problems. In the meantime, another camera was sent as a loaner. It was proudly pronounced in tip top shape and was new. It arrived half packed, used, dirty sensor and dirty contacts for the lens. The AF didn't work. Canon believes that they didn't do anything wrong. Customer Service Rep. Elizabeth Wood responded with a litany of liability-speak but bottom line, they would only send another camera. The MarkIII has significant AF problems, even with the firmware upgrade. Save yourself the stress, don't buy Canon"
2,Do NOT buy this Camera until the AF issue is resolved,"I've owned this camera for about 3 months and it has been to the factory twice and still will not reliably focus correctly. When it does focus correctly or if I shoot landscapes in manual focus mode the images are incredible, but the AF totally sucks and is completely unreliable. It can't be trusted. I've shot hundreds of comparison shots between the 1D MkIII and my 20D and the 20D outperforms it in AF 90% of the time.DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA UNTIL CANON ACKNOWLEDGES THE PROBLEM, ANNOUNCES A FIX FOR IT AND RECALLS/REPAIRS ALL THE CAMERAS THAT HAVE THE PROBLEM AND THE USER COMMUNITY AGREES THAT IT IS FIXED."
2,10Mp's and can't focus worth ......,"Most professional photographers have been putting this camera through its paces since its release. MAJOR FOUCUS ISSUES ... AI Servo can't track a static object let alone a moving one. see [...] to review finds. This camera has the potential to be great, but leaves us hollow and wanting."
2,Poor quality,"I bought this 'Glass Music' DVD of 'Hard to Handle' to replace my USA CBS/Fox VHS tape and was NOT pleased with the quality. Both video and audio were dull compared to the VHS, so I returned it. I think that the original DVD transfer was just poorly done. If you have no other source, this is a great concert (I caught the Dylan/Petty tour in Philadelphia) and you may want to get the DVD anyway."
4,Bob Dylan at his Best,"This is a great concert if you are a true Bob Dylan Fan! It has a young Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers as a backup for Dylan, who is at the top of his game. This concert, I believe, it from the late 60's or early 70's and features some of Dylans great hits, Lay Lady Lay, Knocking on Heaven's Door. Don't expect ""blowing in the Wind"" or other earlier hits. The concert may seem not as polished as later concerts by Dylan or other groups, but it still delivers."
4,A fine book for the football fanatic,"""75 Seasons"" is a coffee table book for the football fanatic. Chocked full of great pictures and stories, it also features the NFL's 75 year all time greatest team, position by position. It is a great gift book for any football fan."
5,Bone-crunching history lesson,"75 seasons is a great trip through NFL history. The drawings may be a little strange, but the text is fantastic and the pictures are classic. The highlight of the book was the all-time team picks. It is undoubtedly a list that would stir up arguments, but you can't disagree with the picks that are there. From Grange to Baugh, Sayers to Smith, and everywhere in between, the background and rich tradition of the NFL is consumed all within this exceptional book."
5,An extremely helpful book.,"I've read hundreds of books on personal growth and development over the years and this book is one of a few that has had a great impact on my life. It is clear, concise and very helpful to anyone desiring fresh inputs and perspective about our life experiences."
5,Excellent!,"I love this cd is wonderful, seriously this guy is getting a lot better, this time his is mixing with another style, this album is a lot more diferent than his others if you like Renaissance Desire then you really have to buy this album both cds are wonderful and are almost perfectly mixed, Dave Seaman is the man."
4,excellent deep house,"this is a nice house compilation ,, its not like buenos aires and cape town ,,, its not trance juts pure deep house i recommend it to everyone that likes house ."
2,"Some may like this sound, Seaman purists do not.","Gone are the slammin' hip trance sounds of Seaman's other 2 GU releases, and in comes a more housey, break beat style, tropical funk that I just don't care for. Anyone liking this style of house may be into this CD, but if you marveled at his past GU's like the solid Cape Town, you will be disappointed with this offering as I am. It's hard to believe he went with such a contrasting style from what he was use to playing. Not one for my collection."
2,Seaman Dissappoints big time,"Well I am just a big Dave Seaman fan when it comes to his trance/house style. He is up there with Sasha and Digweed for their awesome and powerful sounds they produce for our ears to enjoy. But this one really dissappointed me alot. I think i was just expecting too much of his Renaissance sound and Buenos Aires atmosphere, but this one is nearly like a chill out album. What's up with the breaks towards the end? First Deep Dish, now this? When will Global Underground pick up the pace again?"
2,EEW!!,"I am a huge Dave Seaman fan, and this one totally blows in my book. I was bored to tears! I suggest getting his Cape Town GU CD or one of his Rennaissance mixes. I am not a fan of this one. Am I not artsy enough? I wonder. I love CD's that give you that sadness after it is over and you just want to play it all over again, and the Melbourne disc makes me WISH it was over! Way overrated on this site, from an extremely underrated DJ."
3,Good but dated,"Khaled's book provided some good information when it was published but is now outdated as ISO 15504 (called SPICE in the book) has been extensively updated. Two new books on the topic area have recently been published through Springer: Process Assessment and ISO/IEC 15504 - A Reference Book, and Process Assessment and Improvement - A practical guide for managers, quality professionals and assessors. I would recommend readers to look to these books as providing the latest information and real practical implementation guidance."
3,"Helpful, but not all inclusive","This book has a lot of pros: small size-it's easy to carry around in your bag, binding- it's bound with a heavy duty spiral binding which makes it very easy to open to a page and leave it open for reference, gauge - in the back there is a heavy cardboard stich gauge and needle sizer (extremely helpful!), contents - cover a lot of basics and techniques that you may need to refer back to. The only con I would list for this book is that you would also need another guide for some techinques like different ways to drop or add stitches (the book only shows one). Overall, I would recommend this book for a knitter that may be just starting on one of their first projects, but an intermediate knitter looking for more advanced techniques should look elsewhere."
5,Changed my life!,This book helped me through those tough times in which I had contemplated not wearing sweaters ever again. This book has reassured my faith in sweaters.
5,Best knitter's guide ever!,"The Knitter's Companion is just that--if you knit, you want it available at all times. There are step-by-step illustrated directions for every stitch imaginable, even the ones you can't find directions for any place else. There is instruction concerning yarns and needles, and everything you can think of associated with knitting. Truly an excellent guide for knitters."
5,Great Purchase!!,Just as the title says..this little book is a constant source of reference for the knitter..the size is perfect for stashing in the knitting bag..I even bought another one for my daughter!
3,The Knitter's Companion,"The size is perfect to fit in even a small knitting project bag, however, as a beginning knitter I didn't find it particularly useful with the basic things to learn. It has only a few of the basic things. The balance of the book is for more advanced knitters. If one is making clothes this book is a must to own. I'm not sorry I bought it."
3,Just okay,"Nothing new in this book that you can't find in other knitting books or magazines. That aside, because of it's size it is a good little reference book to keep in your knitting bag. Also liked the handly needle size template attached in the book. Personally, I found the Sally Melville books to be more instructive and and continued to go back to them for edification when necessary."
2,Not Impressed,"I purchased two of these Dewalt roofing nailers, just about 3 weeks ago. So far, each gun has approximately 3000 nails through them, and already some very negative things have happened. First of all, both nailers have a double shot problem, that seems to be very consistant. I would say that about every 15th nail, has to be pounded in with a hammer, and about every 20th shot, is a double nail, which also has to be pounded in with a hammer. Not very efficient at all. I have tried both trigger assemblies, and it does not matter which one is used. If you are considering a roofing nailer, the only one I recommend is Bosch. I have a couple of these, and both have 15000+ nails through them, with only one misfire (due to a bad nail). Spend a little more and get a Bosch."
4,More than adequate and a Great Value,"At first, had a tough time completely setting 1 3/4"" nails through second layer of shingles. Increased compressor pressure to 100 and had no more problems. Only one misfire in well over 10,000 nails so far. I occasionally bump the trigger lock when picking up the gun which is slightly annoying. A few other guns I've used are easier to load coils, but this is not a big deal compared to the very reasonable price. More than happy with this purchase."
4,Good Roofing Nailer for the Money,"I was pleased with the nailer, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I could never get it to work properly with the sequential trigger installed. It works flawlessly with the bump trigger installed."
2,Not consistent at all using 1-3/4 inch nails,"I had a small job I needed a coil-roofing nailer for so I rented a MAX CN445R and it performed perfectly using 1-3/4"" hot-dipped ring-shank nails. Renting is expensive and I had a lot of nails left over, so the next time I needed a roofing nailer, I decided to buy one. As I don't need it very often, I thought I could get away with something cheaper than the MAX. I was wrong! Compared to the MAX, I hated the DeWalt. I ended up returning it to Amazon because it simply would NOT drive ring-shank 1-3/4"" hot-dipped nails to the same depth consistently. It has a cheap plastic feel to it and even though I would have rarely used it, I really disliked the performance and over-all feel of the DeWalt, so I sent it back. Perhaps for shorter or smoother nails it would work OK, but don't get it if you need it for 1-3/4"" ring-shank hot-dipped roofing nails."
2,Dewalt DS 1321,"I've beed a long time Dewalt fan, but I wasn't very impressed with the quality of this gun. It also developed an air leak within the fisrt week. Amazon.com has excellent customer service and the return was hassle free. I've been very impressed with Amazon."
4,roofing nailer,"Great price! I can appreciate the lightweight body and ease of use. I don't like the plastic trigger though. The rubber skids on the sides of the gun are a good idea to prevent shingle injury. Also, the exhaust should be more easily adjustable. So far I am pretty satisfied with this gun, although at the end of each coil my gun has about a 90% ratio of shooting the last nail. I've had no problems with double shots unless I'm not paying attention to what I'm doing."
1,"CAUTION: 2 different groups named ""Mythos""","No wonder I thought this album sounded like the Canadian-duo Mythos ...; upon closer inspection, I mistakenly bought this CD which is by a German group also named ""Mythos,"" dating back to 1971. Canadian Mythos did not release until 1996. Although not listed here (yet), another title in the same situation is ""Dreamlab,"" Product #OHR 70020-2."
2,Needs More Work!,"While this bag is the only diaper bag on the market that fits on the Bugaboo stroller handlebar, it's expansion pocket leaves much to be desired. It only expands the bottom half of the bag, while the top half contains numerous pockets, that when in use, expand and create a funnel effect in the middle of the bag. This makes it difficult to pack much of anything into it. While the Expo is not that much larger, it is much easier to use and makes better use of the space.One other thing I don't like is that you have to remove the carrying (shoulder) strap in order to use the smaller side straps that attach it to the stroller. When you want to remove it from the stroller, you have to reattach the strap before you can carry it. Good luck trying to do that in a mall parking lot with a kid, stroller, purse, bags, etc.I gave it two stars because it attaches to the Bugaboo where no other bag does. I would definitely recommend the Expo over the Duo."
3,Almost perfect.,"This would be 5 stars if Lodge could have made a grate that didn't allow charcoal to fall through. I used a current name brand charcoal and tried to light three chimney's worth this weekend. About 10% of the bricks will fall through during the pouring in (annoying) or pouring out (dangerous). Why in the world would you not make the grate smaller? Unless I modify it myself, it is too annoying to use. Thanks, Lodge."
1,Cheaply Built,Day 1 I had to find some way to hold the charcoal grid in place because the cheap bent tabs that were designed to hold it in place broke off before I could use the starter the first time.
5,Elegant Design: Works Well,"After years of using starting fluid which gives food a petroleum taste (to say nothing of the health implications), I came upon this chimney starter and was surprised at how quickly and efficiently such a simple product could get charcoal to cooking temperature.I have used charcoal briquettes (impregnated starting fluid definitely not needed, though it works too), as well as hardwood charcoal in the chimney starter with good results.Note that this product works best with pulpy newspaper as a starter in the bottom (surprisingly little is needed), and paper with even a little shine (such as is used in advertising circulars) can be difficult to work with, as it leaves ash which blocks air flow.Note, too, that turning the chimney over to dump the burning charcoals kicks up cinders, which rise on hot air currents, and that considerable heat comes from both ends of the chimney."
4,Really works! It is a bit bulky.,"This item allows you to start your coals without use of lighter fluid which is smelly, costly, and hazardous. Very easy to use. It is a bit bulky but think about all the money you will save on lighter fluid. In addition, instead of purchasing more expensive self lighting coal you can buy whatever happens to be on sale and it will light up just as well using this coal chimney."
5,Finally broke down and bought one....,"We held out for a long time using the homemade starter chimney out of coffee cans. They work, but they require a lot of effort and babysitting. We finally got the Lodge chimney after getting a new Lodge hibachi. We are year-round propane grillers, but my husband just can't give up the charcoal grill altogether, and using the charcoal chimney really simplifies things when he decides to use the hibachi. It has also cut down on the time commitment because if you follow the directions you will have grill-ready coals a LOT sooner. We definitely recommend this product."
2,Better chimneys out there.,This chimney will work OK but there are better alternatives. Check out the Weber 87886 or the Weber 7416 (I have this one). Both of these models are very durable and have a hand guard and a dump handle. They're 5 or 6 dollars less as well. Lodge makes great dutch ovens (the only ones I own) but seem to put their name on many inferior chinese-made accessories.
5,attention getter,"I bought this book last monday and started it that night,just couldnt put it down,keeped my on the edge of my seat and I couldnt wait to find out what happened next.I came away from this book with a better understanding of what drives men,at the risk of their own lives,to climb such mountains as the Eiger.Well done Mr,OlsenA great read"
2,This one was boring,"I noticed that the other reviews were 5 stars on this one when I looked. I just could not give this one more than two. It was too long in tooth, too long in words, and hardly gripping. It spent too much time talking, and too little time describing action. It seemed to be more about the rescue clubs than about the rescue iitself. I did not find it to be particularily interesting in an fashion. I was disappointed when placed again such books as into thin air, and the other side of everest. These are my opinions, but I could not even finish the book. It seemed likeone of those adventure books that had been translated, and something was lost in the translation."
2,The Read Up Through Hell,"A great story, poorly told. I am an avid outdoorsman and reader; the subject matter of this book is very interesting. Unfortunately, Mr. Olsen wrote this book in a time when it seemed to be fasionable to dazzle one's audience with one's vocabulary. I have not read any of Mr. Olsen's other books, but hopefully he has matured to a less snobbish style in his later works. If you are interested in mountaineering history and don't mind being confronted with an author's ""look how smart I am"" delivery, read this book. Otherwise, you too may be put off as I was."
4,Great holiday cheer collection,"I ordered this 3-pack as a Christmas gift for myself this year, and I'm so glad I did! Elf is my new favorite holiday movie--I've watched it four times since receiving these dvd's. Will Farrell, Zoey Deschanel, James Caan, Bob Newhart and everyone in it are perfect. Even my 91-year grandmother laughed throughout the silliness and said at the end, ""That was really cute."" National Lampoon's Christmas vacation is a classic now, and I'd forgotten how funny the Griswald family antics could be. Fred Claus has it's funny moments too, but is the least favorite of the bunch for me. That one is the only reason this gets four and not five stars. This 3-pack does come in simple packaging, with slim but sturdy cases for each movie. Overall though, these will be permanently added to my holiday movie viewing queue."
2,Almost bad enough to make you want to quit,"The Vachss/Burke combo follows the exploits of a dark, disparate group of misfits in the underbelly of New York. That's the attraction of this series. And the band is back in this third installment but their roles and the basic plot of the novel get diluted when Mr. Vachss deviates into the soft porn genre with the introduction of Belle: an annoying, needy, whiny, woman with a masochist streak in her.Cut out the repetitive, tiring, boring sections devoted to Burke/Belle's sexual encounters and the book could end up being 100 pages lighter and with a better flowing story. Belle's story could have easily been a 4 page sideline; instead it becomes a second sory that actually detracts from the main story line.I almost gave up on this but stayed the course in the interest of the continuity of the series. If you are new to the Burke saga, don't start with this one."
3,Entirely predictable,"There's much to admire with Vachss but having read two before this one it's obvious where his plots lead. Sad girl, sordid past, seedy streets, beatings both administered and taken, feeding Pansy. Just because there's a wise-cracking detective doesn't mean you've got a hard-boiled novel.But he definitely nails New York and its characters...I just wish he had made his protagonists as interesting."
3,"Read it for the series, otherwise forget it","Again, another book of being ""under Burked"". Burke is a great character, hard nosed, mean when has to, holds back nothing, really hard boiled. Vachss describes nasty characters and situations in a fantastic way, you can feel your disgust for them and even some for the society that allows this stuff to happen. Problem is, about 75% of this book isn't about that, it's about Belle, and while she isn't a bad character, she's not the reason to read a Burke book. I found this book to be over sexed and under nasty for one of this series. The characters where good, the outline of the story was good, but the focus was wrong. Read it if you're going through all the series, but don't make it your first one."
1,Repititious whiny Belle,"This was my first Vachss novel and I had a tough time getting through it. All of the characters are extreme ""over the top"" types. Belle is a needy whiny brat, supposedly sexy but I just wanted to slap her. The same scenes keep playing throughout the entire book. Belle whining about her past, Burke and Belle in some boring sex acts, Burke feeding his (over the top) dog, Burke and Belle lighting up smokes, Belle whining to Burke that she loves him. I got so sick of it I wanted to scream. There isn't a single realistic or likeable character in the book."
5,Vachss is the best!,"Blue Belle is the first Vachss book I had read, and I was completely blown away. The prose is spare - there are no wasted words - but the impact was like nothing I had ever read before. I've read everything else by him since, but this stays one of my favorites."
3,Overproduced and Somewhat Lackluster,"Matthew Ryan's ""East Autumn Grin"" brims with promise but is ultimately unfulfilling. His sound and songwriting style are reminiscent of other folkish alternative country artists such as Chris Knight, Stacy Dean Campbell and Steve Earle. But his songwriting is simply not in the same league. ""I Hear a Symphony"" is the only truly memorable song on this disc. And while a number of other songs roll along pleasantly enough, overall there isn't enough material to make this album worth recommending. Additionally, the production gives Ryan's sound a slick sheen that doesn't serve his husky voice well.Overall, this album smacks of an artist who compromised with his label in order to try and hit the big time. It is doubtful that on this attempt he will succeed."
3,Vibrato-fan,"If you wall mount this fan through the available screw mounting holes, make sure you put some kind of vibration absorbing material between the fan and the wall; or it will make it sound like someone is jack hammering your wall.Other than that, this fan is fine. It moves a good amount of air for its size.It's a bit loud, but I understand that the smaller a fans blades are; the higher the RPM the blades need to be spinning to be able to push a proper amount of air. So I didn't go about looking for a small sized fan that was quiet and could actually move air. (THEY DON'T EXIST)"
3,Chintzy,Expected a little better quality. The quality is like something cheap you'd get in the dime store.
4,primus is great!,"Primus is great, and great fun to play. These tabs for the most part are accurate. Some songs are not, but close enough that you'll get it. I really only have two problems, one is that some songs that are listed and tabed as played on a 6 string bass, are actually played on a 4. This is only a ittle bad because some songs sound better on a six, and are more fun. Problem two is a little one and one you probably wont share. I hate that they include the traditional music, if you can read music you would want a music book not a tab book. It cludders the book up and takes up space book. It cludders the book up and takes up space that could have been used for other songs"
5,A Breathtaking album!,"This album is amazing, and one of my favorite cd's out of my collection. The mix of Metal and Folk creates a perfect sound that is known only as ''Ensiferum''. Jari Maenpaa is a songwriting genius and all of his work has impressed me greatly. This CD really got me into folk metal, and foreign metal in general.The CD has multiple types of songs such as fast, energetic songs (hero in a dream, token of time, windrider) and ballad like songs (Eternal Wait, Abandoned,Old Man). This is One of the few cd's i own that i can put in, listen the every single song and fully enjoy it, also knowing most of the lyrics.I highly recommend the CD to anyone that is looking into the folk-metal genre, or into ensiferum."
2,You can find better...,"Perhaps the worst camping reference I own (make that owned). The book is full of repeated text. A half-hearted effort at best. Only the most basic information is provided for each campground. Not near enough for an out-of-towner or out-of-stater to confidently plan a trip. I ended up tossing it out in favor of multiple web sites (for detailed campground info) combined with the Montana Atlas and Gazeteer (for accurate mileage, elevation, etc.). There is absolutely zero information about the surroundings, forestation, landscape, or scenery at each campsite -- only general comments about the larger area or national forest in which each campground is located."
2,Disappointing is right.,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas, to plan our anniversary trip in June. I browsed through it, disappointed with how difficult it was to find campgrounds along our route, how cumbersome looking up maps was, as well as that difficult table of contents. Just look in the book online -- what does MT3 tell you? Nothing. That's the problem.Check out www.publiclands.org for help finding a campsite. We're into National Parks, and the best overall guide for the Western US we've found is Fodor's Road Guide USA : National Parks of the West. It has enough detail on each park to give you a basic understanding of what you can expect. Don't try this for a hiking guide though."
3,Disappointing,"Readers who had prior editions of this series will be disappointed. The new author has very little commentary. It's now just a listing of campgrounds with facts. Is there shade, are the campsites private, how's the access road, is it busy ... who knows? Many of the campground notes are literally cut-and-pasted from the prior entry. Unfortunately Idaho wasn't covered in the older edition by Tom Stienstra. Very disappointing!"
2,"inclusive, but skimpy","All inclusive of number of campgrounds and locations, but descriptions meager, and repetitive. Allows little discrimination between campgrounds."
3,A little more info please...,"while this book (done in the style of the wonderful Tom Steinstra books) was helpful it lacked the descriptions and information that truly make a book of this type useful. we used the book while traveling in Idaho and Wyoming and it pointed out several spots. the ratings however were inconsistant with the sites we visited. some sites were rated 4 or 5 when they should have been a 7; others were rated at 5 when they should have been a 3. the book is obviously out of date but was the only book of this type we could find. there's a market niche out there just waiting to be filled!Foghorn Outdoors: Montana, Idaho, & Wyoming Camping: The Complete Guide to more than 1200 Campgrounds"
4,Creative Recipes,This is a sweet recipe book. There are some exciting recipes from all over the world and I cant wait to try them all!
5,Incompetence-on-Rampage!,"Mr. Galbraith writes with authority and enthusiasm. Although his politics are clear, he paints the neo-con's domino'ing incompetence following the fall of Baghdad with as much objectivity as humanly possible. At points it is hard to digest the rampant incompetence, corruption and cronyism--sometimes so unbearable I had to close the book and take a few deep breaths. This is not Bush-bashing for the sake of bashing--this is a careful and authoritative look at what happened and what is happening in Iraq. If you care enough to read this far, you must read The End of Iraq. For an even better understanding, read it right after John Keegan's The Iraq War."
5,Why Are We in Iraq?,"A must read for anyone interested in finding out about the US and NATO role under the Bush policy in the Iraqi civil war.Galbraith brings his personal experiences to bear on today's most pressing issue of war and peace, particularly in regard to Kurdistan. Although underestimating the effectiveness of the US led surge before it got underway, he does present a first rate account of the divergent elements in Iraq leading up the the present conflict, and proposes a viable road map to peace through a loose political federation with limited autonomy and self-rule for Sunni, Shiite, and Kurds in particular, while protecting the rights of religious and ethnic minority groups and individuals."
3,"Great Analysis of the Bushs', but what about Clinton?","Galbraith, with his inside account of the history of the Iraq situation, details George H. W. Bushs' administration as well as George W. Bushs' administration, policies and actions leading to our current situation in Iraq, however, mysteriously missing are the Clinton years. I would add the additional two stars to this book if he analyzed the Clinton years policies and actions, but the eight years Clinton spent in office, and his policies are not analyzed in anyway. In doing so, this book makes it appear that Mr. Galbraith is an ardent Democrat with an agenda against the Republicans. When i read such books, detailing the history and policies that lead us to our current situations, I require analysis of all periods leading up to the present, not just a select few.I appreciate the insight Mr. Galbraith provides, and concur on many of his points, but leaving out the Clinton Administration, from this history, leaves this book severely incomplete."
4,A must read!,"Peter Galbraith has written a compelling account of what went wrong in Iraq. I would have given him 5 stars but he defends Chalabi too much and he is an advocate of the Kurds. I too admire the Kurds but they also have their faults. Right now they speak with one voice but they have to prove that this will last.Also, I detect some sour grapes because he has been left out in the cold by the Bush Administration. Having been left out of course speaks for him!Everything else in the book is right on target. He certaionly would have done a better job than the Yahoos we sent to Iraq. I fully agree with his assessment of Wolfowitz and his ilk. His recommendation to in effect partition Iraq into three parts is probably the only viable alternative to utter chaos. That solution too has risks but probably is the best bet.Reinhard Schumann"
5,The definitive book on Iraq.,"Not only a complete history of the area and the country, but Galbraith suggests the most rational way out for the U.S. and the peoples living in Iraq."
4,A mostly balanced account of mistakes made,"The mistakes become clear and obvious with hindsight so the author does not have a big problem placing the blame on Paul Bremer and many others.With regard to the future, on page 224, he writes that the Iraqi solution for most of the country is partition. But in mixed areas in Baghdad there is no solution in the foreseeable future. Let us hope that that the surge in Baghdad which is showing some early signs of success proves Mr. Galbraith wrong."
5,Galbraith book review,This is an outstanding book that gives the history and context to the Iraq war by a person who has extensive experience in the region. This book is easy to read and is a must read for every voter before Nov 7!
5,Sonny Morgan Music,"Co Co de Mer is an early album of Sonny's which has some great examples of the Seychelles Sega style. There are Seven albums of his Sega, Reggae and Seggae music available and his new Album 'Tropical experience' is being released at the Creole Festival 2002 in October on Mahe Island, Seychelles. The UK release of this Album will be called 'Architect'."
3,.357 magnum,"This is an okay action movie. I thought the acting was OK, but the over-the-top violence made up for it. Check it out if you're so inclined, but there are better things out there."
2,Exspected better quality,This is a very cheap plastic handled twister. When you put pressure on it to tighten a wire tie it gets very tight to twist.I use these almost everyday for hours at a time. This is by far the worst one I have ever used.
2,"what a let down ,obi wan","he is probably my 2nd most favorite character in star wars.first of all,buy a bigger version,it is petite.while the robes and the appearance is ok.somehow it doesnt work out as a set piece.rest assured i will definitely get a better obi wan toy."
4,Tamilee's Women Only,"Tamilee Webb is a fabulous trainer and I love her tapes. This one is a little unusual in that she comes on for the warm-up and then lets a gentleman lead you through the exercises. She pops on again in the middle for a little aerobic (hip hop) section between sets. Her philosophy, she explains, is that it's more fun to watch a good looking man than her. Overall, the tape is quite good and very easy to follow."
3,It's ok,"When I think about this Summerslam I think about how I was thinking about attending since it was in my neck of the woods, L.A. But, I decided to save my money & wait for the Blu ray instead. So, once I was able to buy it, I ordered it & it was ok. Nothing really memorable, but then again a lot of what WWE does today really is'nt. The only match that stood out to me was HHH vs. Brock Lesnar. I don't think these two ever went at it back when Brock had his first run w/ the company & so I was looking forward to watching their match. Decent match but it was nothing great. So, all in all it was ok."
3,WWE Summerslam 2012 review,"The Chris Jericho-Dolph Ziggler match was a pretty solid and hard-fought match. The Kane-Daniel Bryan match was not great but pretty good. The Miz-Rey Mysterio match for the IC title was so-so at best. The Albert Del Rio-Sheamus match for the World's title was pretty good but could have done better. The Tag Team title match between the team of Kofi Kingston & R-Truth against The Prime Time Players while both teams put good effort,it was nothing special to say the least. The CM Punk-John Cena-Big Show 3 way match for the WWE title was decent but we expected more. The Brock Lesnar-Triple H match while having its highspots and moments,it fell short to both wrestlers matches from months ago. I give this event a 6 out of 10."
5,"""I LAUGH IN THE FACE OF DANGER.....then hide till it's gone""","In order to understand the entire buffy novels,one needs to understand Xander.This book details probably the most intimate things anyone will be able to get with the character.From his feelings for his best friend Willow to chrush unfulfilled Buffy,dating and romance in Sunnydale is truly humerous.....for Xander it's the most harzardous thing to do. Full of laughs and deep thought,to understand buffy,you need to understand why she does'nt just crumple from the pressure of slaying. Because Xander will always be there...laughing at the world."
5,Worth the money,"A very good book. Showcased Xander very well and drew all the episodes together, especially for someone who hasn't seen them yet!"
5,Great Book,"I am already thinking of buying this book, andd it looks great . Xander is oneo f the most interesing and realistic people on Buufy the Vampire Slayer. This looks liek a great book."
5,Great Book for the Xander fans!,"I was a little behind in picking this one up but I was glad that I did. Poor Xander, he is always one behind when it comes to the female species. From large praying mantis, to Inca Mummy girls, Xander really knows how to pick them. IT is too bad that he cannot seem to see what is right in front of his face (i.e. Willow) would be his best bet for a potential girlfriend. Atleast she won't try to eat him or suck his life out with a single kiss. If you are a Xander fan or just a plain all around Buffy fan, you need to pick this one up!"
2,Break away clip too weak,The collar was a bit thick and difficult to bend. The break away clip was too quick to give and the collar was lost within a week.
3,nice collar but beware of picture,"oops, should have taken pic as my evidence.anyway, bought this collar in blue. very nice quality, very very shiney-reflective but not in a cheap way (i almost feel like my cat has some bling on). cat safe clasp is a tight for my liking but works ok. the biggest complaint i want to point out is the color. it isnt as pictured if you plan to buy blue. the amazon pic above shows a true blue color. however, in real life, it will be turquoise blue. yea...think almost like the caribbean seacoast. my cat is amazing azure blue eyes and a greyish blue coat; this collar clashes with her fur and eye color--the reason why i got this collar in the first place was cause of color. So if u are buying the blue, expect a true turquoise. apologies on my not having a picture--just packed it up to return it to Amazon."
3,HUGE,"I've worn Clarks for years and just ordered my regular size even though I'd read comments from other buyers that the shoes were sized smaller than average,I just went ahead and purchased what size I always wore. When I put on the shoes, I honestly don't know how other shoppers got SMALL, they were HUGE!! I could easily slip two fingers behind my heel."
4,Good older game for slower PCs,"This is a good older game for your pre-dual core systems with good graphics and gameplay. The controls can be a little touchy at times and the control interface could be more ""adjustable"" but overall, it looks good and wont require a mega system to run it well."
1,Not controllable with keyboard (on i5 & SSD notebook),"Absolutely impossible to control lean! You have to be on/off with throttle which is the oposite of smooth throttle. Brakes slam to hard. Games are supposed to be fun, not peice you off. May pull out of trash and try on desktop with a joystick. Graphics are good but if I can't play it, so what."
2,GAME IS SO SO AT BEST...,"I was expecting so much more out of this game. I have superbike 2000 and 2001 and they are by far a much better game. they are more realistic and more fun to play. I assumed that during the past few years since SBK 2001 came out that the graphics and overall game play would be that much better, but to my surprise this game just seemed to be like an ok arcade version of motorcycle racing. oh well, it was worth a try."
1,Very inefficient purchase,"The contents of this CD are the same as CD #1 in a 5-CD set available here at amazon for just a few dollars more than this CD by itself. And you can get the whole 5 CD set at Presto classical in the UK for even less than at amazon.com. These are good, late '70's analogue recordings - a very good intro to Schumann's chamber music. Just don't buy this particular issue."
4,A Terry Pratchett fan,The video caught the ironic wit of Terry Pratchett's Discworld. I liked the video and wished that there were more of the series from England available on Amazon.
4,Great Book,This book proves that there is something else waiting for us after death. That something is filled with love and hope.
3,"Comforting, but????","I am a Christian (Lutheran). I would love to believe it but this book goes against everything that the Bible says about sin, the afterlife, hell, etc. as well as endorsing (and ignoring warnings about) mediums, etc. I am surprised that Sherry, an ordained Lutheran minister, could co-write this book. I believe in a 'God of love' but this book fails to recognize 'evil', and I find it difficult to believe that Hitler, Stalin, Genghis Khan and even satan will eventually go to Heaven after spending a few confused years of 'spirit wandering' in 'lower planes' after death."
1,Does not fit Bosch GCM12SD,"Received the Dual Line Laser Guide, part 21362, it does NOT fit the Bosch GCM12SD 12"" Sliding Compound Mitre Saw. Not even close. Add needs to be more specific about Bosch model numbers."
5,AWESOME little beast!,"I've had this camera for a week and taken a plethera of pictures and little movies. The 7.2 pixels and zoom work great. It's about the size of a deck of cards, but has all the big camera features. Use it in automatic mode, or adjust to manual for you camera pros. I put in a 1 Gig memory stick and haven't run out of room yet! Downloads are easy or you can print directly to the printer. If you have big fingers you might find the buttons a little difficult. Too many features to mention, I'm still finding them. Want something small enough for a little purse or pocket with all the big camera features? This is it!"
2,Great photos; fragile camera!,"I would advise people to look elsewhere for a digital camera. Although I do like the Sony's menus, features, and photo quality, the camera is simply too fragile to be of use to anyone who plans on taking it into an active environment. Don't ask me how, but I managed to break the LCD display while the camera was in my pocket. I didn't drop it, didn't bang it up against anything, or create any type of impact. The cost to repair the LCD is $181. If it weren't for the fact that I invested in a Sony-style memory card, I'd be looking at Kodak's and Canon's. This isn't the first time that Sony has sold me something that was pretty rather than functional, and it will be the last time I invest in their electronic equipment."
1,very delicate,"I bought my fourth cibershot from sony.The others died during the first year.....this one take good pictures and has a lot of functions, but they aremade in a way thay they never works for more than one year giving him apropietly care and use.is very delicate avoid itSony cibershot never againand the service charged you more than a new one for repair it"
4,Fantastic compact digital camera,"Though I expected more, the W70 is a worthy addition to our camera collection. It is best in sunlight. Flash pictures are sometimes blurry in automatic mode due to the strange use of high ISO settings.At the same time, the 7 megapixel shots are occasionally spectacular with the right settings. 13x19 printouts are not grainy. We are almost finished with a 13x19 photo album of a recent trip and the shots are all very good for a compact camera.This camera has turned out to be much better than I originally expected. Having worked with it for a few weeks, the settings are not buried as deep as I originally thought and after some experimentation, my wife and I have found excellent settings for all circumstances that we've encountered so far."
1,Ok for Outside - Not ok for indoors,"I bought this camera since I always buy Sony products. I have a H5 and it's the bomb! But this W70 camera is SOOOO disappointing... if you only plan on taking pictures outside, then it's fine - but indoors I cannot get a quality picture. No matter what setting (and we have tried them all) - pictures are too dark, or either completely white... I got it for my daughter's birthday a month ahead so I'd have it - but we tried it out for a week and hate it and now cannot return it since it's been over 30 days :( My opinion... there are other cameras that are way better ......"
2,Breaks,"Had camera for a brief time, lcd broke while in the carrying case without any kinda of dropping or stress, then even though we had bought the ""Full Coverage"" insurance, they would not fix or have anything to do with it."
2,Very poor at action shots,"I am not the type of person who has ""issues"" with a camera. Although I am not a professional photographer, I find the amateur pictures I have taken in the past have served both myself and family/friends well. I would not consider myself a bad picture taker.I have a 7 month old son, who is currently my favorite photo subject, and I am hard pressed to take a picture that isn't blurry. The focus takes FOREVER. Even if I am holding the camera perfectly still and focusing on a rock the ""motion artifact"" icon will blink. The good pictures I do get are quite nice, but that is perhaps 20% of the shots I take.I had a Kodak EasyShare 2 megapixel that hands down took better pictures.Although I do like the large LCD screen and the rechargeable batteries are also a big plus, this camera has not been great overall and I certainly don't recommend it for anyone with small children who are unpredictable subjects."
2,"Lovely camera, for about a year...","I received this camera as a gift. It looks nice and took fine enough pictures, but after about 1 year, the navigational buttons went haywire. If I press up, the menu scrolls left, right and it goes up. Its barely usable anymore and every setting is stuck on the ""multi-shot"" feature. Sometimes I can rig it to work, bit I don't think a $300+ camera should have to be ""rigged"" to do what it was made to do. I, too, called customer service and received the same ""flat-rate"" repair fee of $180.00. I laughed and told the customer service rep that was ridiculous. I am sure I can find this, or another usable cameram elsewhere for that price. And I won't have to wait months for its return. If you do buy this camera, maybe spring for the extended warranty and ask what it specifically covers, just in case."
2,wasted money,"Bought this on a recommendation from the salesperson at best buy & bcz it's a sony in the price range I wanted. This camera repeatedly got out-done by all of my friends cheaper cannons and kodaks (in the $50 range!)even on autofocus! Took it back & got most of my money back. Sony's higher end models seem to perform the best ($500 & up) but the mid & low range don't compare against cannon, nikon, etc IMO. This camera is not Out Of the Box Ready.Nothing worse than spending $350 on a camera to go on vacation in the tropics & have 200 fuzzy pics to show for it!"
5,Stop a cold or flu in its tracks!,Metagenics Andrographis is the best immune booster I've ever tried and to keep a cold or flu at bay. I would not be without this in my medicine cabinet ever.
2,This Church Is Not Appearing Glorious...,"This book offers a lot of good information, but it has so many typographical errors that it's difficult to concentrate on the message. The author writes well; why didn't anyone proofread the manuscript before printing it? There are literally hundreds of typos - overused and misplaced commas, incorrect punctuation, misplaced and missing hyphens, uneven capitalizations; the list goes on. I appreciate the book for its wisdom and intent, but the presentation is so bad it doesn't live up to its potential; thus the low rating. My copy is not marked ""uncorrected proof,"" but it should have been. I highly recommend a reprint - with the help of a good proofreader. The book deserves better."
3,Only the center of the Dragon glows.,"It was agreat idea, but unfortunately only the center of the dragon glows so it does not look great at night. Too bad as I love dragons and my car."
5,Fun,Works just like it says. Very bright neon green that is always illuminated so long as it is plugged into the cars power adapter. I wish they had more color choices!
4,"One of Polanski's best underground films, before 'Rosemary's Baby' stardom.","Bizzare, to say the least about two gangsters, one critically wounded, who take to inviting themselves into an even more bizzare couple's castle home. Worthy follow up to Polanski's previous, ""Repulsion"" - the film that put him on the map for American audiences. Good cast, and hysterical to see a very serious, Donald Pleasence of ""Halloween"" fame dressed in drag with makeup. Oh, yes this is different..."
1,WHY DON'T THEY PUT IT IN USA FORMAT ?,Ridiculous that you cannot buy this in a DVD that plays on a regular DVD player--------
5,This album is a life-long friend.,"So when I was a kid, my family ran into Spencer Lewis when he was hanging around a craft fair at Hildene Meadows in Vermont, picking at his guitar in the rain. He had some CD's with him. We bought one. It became one of the things we always listened to when driving around in beautiful places. I still listen to it regularly today. Other things that I put on the list of stuff I listen to when appreciating nature or even trying to be calm and content while facing stress in my urban life include Handel's Water Music and the works of Palestrina. This holds up well in the comparison. So do several of his other albums, which are mostly beautiful, daydream-inducing, and instrumental. Highly recommended."
3,Jack's Mom,"My son is now 9 months and we hate this chair. He is able to pick up the trays and detach them and also for the past two months he does something with his feet and knocks the trays off which is very dangerous and leads to tons of messes. It wasen't that big of a problem which early on but now it flies across my kitchen every night. It is also very hard to work the 5 point harness it takes two hands and the wheels don't work that well on carpeting. It was great when he was 4 months and barely moved his hands and feet and only eat Cereal but now that he is older it's a huge waste of space and money. When I registered for it I liked the colors (it matches my kitchen) and I trusted the Graco name, I sure learned my lesson."
3,"Good chair, but could be better","Okay,My son was 2 1/2 weeks early and this chair was great at first, because we could sit him in it and he couldn't go anywhere. Now, 8 months later, not so great. I guess he is small for his age, but it seems he is still to short for the chair & even sitting up, he still can barely reach any food on the tray. He can also kick the tray right off of the chair, which is obviously very dangerous. And food does go everywhere if he has an accident or spills something. It doesn't roll very easy, either. The wheels get turned around & you have to physically pick up the chair and turn them back around the right way. And forget folding it up & storing somewhere. Even folded, it is quite bulky! Actually, I don't even think it makes a difference to fold it up. It's easier to just put it somewhere and forget it. It was very comfortable for him when he was still on a bottle, but now that we are starting solids & other things, he really seems to have a hard time in the chair."
1,not easy to use,"I bought this highchair mostly because I liked the looks of it, it fit well with my kitchen decor. It took about 1/2 hour to put together, every piece was separate. What I dislike the most about it is that the tray is almost impossible to use with one hand. Also, it doesn't get close enough to my son who is five months old, but loves being up with the rest of the family. The tilt also doesn't move easily with one hand which is also very inconvenient. Overall, I would not buy this high chair again."
1,features are not one-handed.,"I have to stuggle to raise and lower this high chair. It does look great in my kitchen--but, the fabric seat gets dirty so quick. one big mouth wipe against the side and i am working on taking the thing apart & off to wash.(New mothers certainly do not have this sort of extra time!) i assume having the pad washed this much will fade and look worn soon. THe wheels do not help roll the chair around..it seems more like sliding even when the little brakes are off. And, lastly...the tray doesnt seem too sturdy when attached. There are better ones out there for a better price! P>S the dishwasher safe trays do not fit in any normal size dishwasher!"
2,What a mess!,"I recently purchased this high chair for my six month old daughter who frequently wipes her mouth, hands, etc on the seat. We have also had a few vomiting incidents as is often the case with babies mastering their first solids. After a few washings the material does begin to fade and the padding inside the seat shifts forming lumps throughout. After about a month I ended up purchasing a new chair pad that is a bit more user friendly. Other than that the chair works well."
1,Not worth it,"This clunky high chair is awful. The latch to recline the seat sticks and you need two hands to try and get it to release. There's no frills, like a place to put bibs, and it's very awkwardly formed and very bulky. The whole chair slants forward no matter what adjustments I've tried to make. Other than the color scheme, there's nothing I like about the chair and don't look forward to having to deal with it when I have a baby in my arms. Very unhappy with this product."
2,Okay Highchair,"I like how the cover is very wipeable and that it does adjust to different hights and reclines. However, it is very difficult to do all the adjusting. At first I thought the recling feature was broken because it was so difficult. I mainly bought this highchair because it matched my pack 'n play. Do not buy this chair for looks! Try it out in the store first!"
3,"Not a horrible chair, but not the best","I have had my son in this chair since he was about 4 months old. It has a great feature to support younger infants, and adjusts quite easily, however the toy bar keeps falling off and it is NOT dishwasher safe because the upper tray shrunk and does not fit properly on the main tray. I do like that it is easy to clean the seat and pieces and the basket underneath is a bonus to store wipes and bibs."
1,BAD chair!!!,This chair has several problems:1. Tray won't stay latched on (dangerous)2. It's too tall and not adjustable enough.3. It's VERY hard to clean--you have to take the whole thing apart or take it outside and shake it and then hose it off.4. It doesn't scoot easily on carpet.5. It is not very transportable or easy to store.You can do better with another chair.
1,Don't But It,"This highchair is awful! My son never sat comfortably in it, and now that he's 11 months old, he's learned to pick up the tray (yes, I said he picks it up) and heave it onto the floor. The tray doesn't properly lock onto the chair. The tray sits to far away from my son as well. He is covered with food by the end of his meals; if the tray were closer, it would catch some of those pieces that don't make it into his mouth. Don't buy this product! There are many others that work better and are more affordable."
1,Don't Buy It!,"We bought this high chair because we liked the tray as well as the style and functions the chair had. We were very disappointed in the wheels. They do not roll well at all and scratched up our new wood flooring. We were going to deal with that then the seat will not click back into place from the recline mode. I called Graco and they sent us a new chair however the replacement chair does the same thing. The customer service rep explained to us how to get the plastic to click back in but we don't have the time or want to have to take off the padding and mess with clicking a piece of plastic back into place each time we recline the seat. Also, the basket on the back doesn't stay on nor does the toy bar. I wish I had read reviews before I purchased this. It would have saved a lot of time and aggravation. If you are looking for a good quality high chair this is not it!"
2,Things get stuck!,"We live in a small town and have a very limited assortment of high chairs. At Walmart there were two, and we chose the more expensive Graco. We have a Graco stroller and love it, so I wsas fairly comfortable with our decision. Now I am wondering if plastic is the best choice. We, too, had trouble assembling it (things get stuck), and when I tried to adjust the seat back I found it nearly impossible to push and lift the handle. One day I decided to change it from a reclined position to upright since my daughter can sit well assisted, and the handle got stuck. Now the chairback will slide from one position to the next without locking, so she ends up nearly lyihng on her back. I'm pretty disappointed, and annoyed that we have to now drive three hours away to find a better chair. Boo."
1,Take it back!,"I didn't even attempt to use this high chair on my infant. As soon as I put it together I could tell it was cheap. You need 4 hands and 3 feet to get it to relcine and to pull out the tray. Not to mention the tray is not safely secure and it is really big and bulky (the entire chair). It won't even fit under my dining room table at its lowest setting. And the coaters scratched up my wood floors, too. Really dissapointed with this Graco product."
1,Not Worth the Money,"We bought this high chair because of the capability for an infant to safely sit in it. This chair has been nothing but a pain. The wheels do not move easily, therefore scratching our wood floor, the adjustment to recline the chair is awful. One must literally yank the chair back before it will recline. Also, the chair is big and bulky. We wanted this chair because it can ""fold up"", well that has issues as well. Cleaning the chair is a pain because of all the creavices the chair has.We purchased a $50 high chair to keep at grandma's house and it is so much easier to move, recline, and clean. Save your money and don't buy this high chair."
5,Fantastic Resource,"This is the first book that offers a complete guide to any waterproofing related subject. Even better it offers a great chapter on finding and resolving leaks when they occcur. THIS CHAPTER IS WORTH THE PRICE OF THE BOOK ITSELF! Anybody in the design, engineering or construciton fields needs this book on their bookshelf. Finally somebody has got this subject right!"
2,"Dated text, weak on technical details","I bought this thinking since it was a 2008 edition it would be up-to-date on the latest materials and techniques. Not. This is essentially the year 2000 edition and does not address the composite bentonite-hdpe systems that are common today. I was also looking for some technical details on how a bentonite system should work but only a few overview-type comments were in the text.Most of the drawings are clear and useful, but the black and white photos are small and sometimes hard to discern what is being depicted.All in all, this book is a useful resource but not worth the high price being charged.EDIT: On Page 2.58, author states: ""Clay swells 10-15 percent of its dry volume under maximum wetting."" This is incorrect, should be 10-15 TIMES, not percent. At 10-15 percent, bentonite would not work."
4,Nice but too small,"I bought it for my miniature schnauzer, but it came too small. I had to order in large, but when I received the medium size, I saw that it was a very good product."
2,Raincoat OK But Large ????,"As a raincoat the product is OK, but the large one is not really large, in my opinion it should be classified as Medium."
2,"Good Design, Tight Fit","I had been looking a long time for a rain jacket for my dog, who has a fluffy coat. When I received the coat, the raincoat did not fit at all. Poor dog looked like he was in a straight jacket! Amazon was great and I returned it the same day, with no cost to me. I think if your dog has short hair, it probably will fit (but I think it runs a little small). But if you have a fluffy dog like mine (Finnish Lapphund), skip this as it will not fit. I loved the overall design of the coat, especially how it covers the underside of the body and the back legs."
5,My two nephews are enchanted with these!,"I purchased this little fellow in Prague after being given the Dragon for Christmas. It's a remarkably detailed piece, with an amazing level of historical accuracy in the armor and armaments of the 14th/15th century. It's made of highly durable plastic, and overall it's rugged enough to withstand the rigors of entertaining youngsters. I bought several other members of the Schleich Knights series for my two nephews, aged 4 and 6, so there is minimal concern that the detachable parts could be dangerous for young children. The pieces come in two opposing camps: the Red Fleur de Lis, and the Blue Lion, and each piece has a corresponding piece in the other, with somewhat different design and graphics. This reflects an impressive variety in styles of armament and armor of the period, and vastly improves the educational value of the series. The level of detail, for this price, is actually quite surprising."
3,I dunno what to say..,"I really dont know what to say about this album. I just dont like it. It just seems to repetitive. Maybe i just dont like house. One of the reviews said this was ""The best TRANCE cd ever"" so i got it. I have been thoroughly dissappointed. I still listen to it sometimes however. I wouldn't say its not worth owning it just doesnt click with me like alot the stuff does."
1,This CD SUCKS!!!!,"I like trance specially the beat and the rhythm, but this CD doesn't have any of that. The music is just no good the only good tracks are number 5 and 8 because they keep their rhythm the rest of the songs have a lot of that transitional stuff where you only hear the song with no beat. Its really not worth it."
4,Worked for us.,"Cheaper than going to the RV store or Campingworld. If your RV uses these for the drawers, you can plan on replacing them every 3 years or so. They are just not as strudy as we would like. That said....these were easy to install and work fine AND don't cost that much....so what the heck, just get them."
2,"Great features, grainy display","This had been intended as a gift for my wife and we were both disappointed. Image playback was way too dark and the frame lacks an option to adjust brightness. Resolution was on par with other frames but the images appear grainy. Also important to note is that while a 16x9 display seems like the way to go its pointless when 99% of all photos taken are 4x3. You're either stuck zooming in on your 4x3 photos to fill the screen (thus losing image area) or playing back the image in it's original aspect ratio with bars to the left and right of the image.We eventually went with theMatsunichi Photoblitz 8"" Digital Picture Framewhich turned out to be a great 4x3 frame with a sharp, clear display."
5,Very Nice,"I got these for my nieces for Christmas. They absolutely loved them. A lot nicer than I was expecting, cool looking piece of jewelry for children/early teenagers."
5,Can I get an Amen...and another Star,"I won't get into all the comparisons of Tommy to other great artists, the influences are obvious. This CD should put Tommy Sims along side those artists, and it will be he that now influences & inspires those that follow.What I suggest is that you put this CD on, get comfortable in your favorite sofa or chair, turn the lights down and let this gifted artist share his vision of ""Peace & Love"". It will touch your soul.His music & lyrics continue to take me to a wonderful emotional level, like something sweet that you just can't get enough of. Tommy's been paying his dues for a long time and I can only wish that ""Peace and Love"" will now take him to a ""Higher Ground""."
1,"Poorly written, and with misinformation to boot","With sections no longer that a few pages, ""Down and Dirty"" reads like a 5 grade book report. The subjects are presented in a ""First he did this, then he did that"" manner with little insight added. While it may be a good and light introduction to the genre, it certainly has no depth beyond that.Most infuriating is the misinformation of several of the lesser known people. Occupations, chronologies, and sometimes even names are wrongly presented.This book is obviously written by a fan of the films. But he is no historian."
3,It is what it is,"When this book was first published in 1993, it served as a good primer for those who were generally unfamiliar with the filmmakers whose careers and output are discussed within these pages. Since then, countless articles, blogs and other books have expanded upon (often in painstaking detail) many of these same subjects. So it's easy to overlook the fact that this was a fairly ground-breaking volume for its time. While in-depth studies can be found elsewhere, DOWN AND DIRTY remains a good starting point to learn about some of the most noteworthy folks in this special-interest field. This book is what it is, just like the category of cinema it covers."
3,Rolling Briefcase Okay,"I purchased the rolling briefcase and within two weeks after the purchase the plastic covers over the wheels came off. I cut them off the rest of the way so that the bag would roll and it still works but for the amount of money that I paid, you would not think that it would fall apart that quickly. I only attend school at night 4 days a week so it wasn't like I was very hard on it. It still serves it's purpose and provides helpful storage to me so I give it 3 stars.Regina Coker"
2,this product does not work,it does not work. I have a 1000 gal pond and I put in 10oz but it does not reduce any ammonia level in the pond.
1,Defective: Refer to other Reviewers Also,"I popped the SD card into my brand new Canon S5 IS and started snapping. After 20 shots, the SD card failed and was unreadable in the camera. Attempts to format failed as well as the card was unresponsive.I have sinced purchased two SanDisk 2gb Ultra II SD cards and am very pleased with their speed, consistency, and reliability.It's partly my fault for going for the lowest priced Class 6 SDHC card. But for the card to fail so quickly and readily was a huge surprise.Amazon was prompt with the return and refund.SanDisk SDSDH-2048-901 2 GB Ultra II Secure Digital Memory Card (Retail Package)"
1,Questionable QC - Not worth the gamble,"Prior to purchasing, I had read glowing reviews regarding the speed and value. I also happened to see a couple users that warned about corrupted data. Due to the attractive price, I bought two of these cards. After using them, both reviews are correct. The cards are very fast AND prone to corruption (at least one of the cards that I have).After shooting over 100 pics one day on vacation in Maui, the data became corrupted and could not access any of the images through the camera or computer. Fortunately I had some data rescue software (RescuePro, rec'd free with a SanDisk III Extreme card) that was able to retrieve all but one image but what a headache (and anxiety!).As attractive as the price is, I will not buy it again. Even if another card may cost a few dollars more...it is worth it. If you persist in buying this card, then invest in some good data recovery software because you will likely be using it."
2,"It works, but very slow","I bought this 4GB SDHC card expecting fast read/write performance since it's advertised as a class 6, 150x card. On the bright side, the card works. But the transfer speed is very slow. I use it in my digital camera (Panasonic TZ5) and I'm only getting about 3 megabytes/sec transfer out of this card, which is about half of Class 6 speed (which is supposed to be 6 MB/sec) and only a fraction of the 150x speed rating (which is supposed to be 22.5 MB/sec) that the card is advertised at. It's not worth the hassle and the money to return this card since it was cheap, but there are other cards at the same price range that don't seem to have as many problem cases.So overall I would not buy this product again."
4,Works great....except,"This card works fine except I did have a problem with my ""Lexar USB card reader""....for some reason it won't work with this card (however does work on 2gb cards that I have). A bit strange and disappointing."
5,A-Data Turbo 4 gb sdhc class 6,"this is a not a "" review "" as such. I bought this product for a good price for my canon SD 800IS. It works well, i did know if the camera would recognize the 4 gb capacity. very happy with it."
1,Never buy it!!!!,"I only used it for few times. Now it fails to work properly and always showing ""Error Message"". The card cannot be formated or used anymore. I have also tried other cards like Kingston, Toshiba, Sandisk and even Kodak. They are more reliable."
1,Case Failing After 4 Months,Plastic casing is under-designed. It's showing signs of wear stress after 4 months of repeated insertions. 2 other cards (other manufacturers) are used in rotation in a Pocket PC. A-Data is the only one showing stress. I'm moving it to another application where it doesn't have to be repeatedly inserted. I use it to move .AVI files from the PC to the PPC where I can watch multimedia at my convenience. Very cool technology.
5,Super fast and no problems,"I put this card in a recently purchased Nikon D40x. The card works great. I love how fast it transfers pictures from the card to the PC. I can copy 4mg pictures from the card to my pc faster than my old 2gb card could copy 900kb pictures.For the price, and the excellent performance I don't see how you could go wrong."
2,Slow,"This class 6 rated SDHC card is much slower than my other cards. Campared to Transcend 4gb 150x SD and Sandisk Ultra CF, this card takes 2-3 times as long to write. Tested in 2 different card readers, same overall result."
3,Good product,"Well, so far, so good. I'm using on a iPaq 111 and it's working good. So it's something strange with this memory card, it look's like he has a ""belly"" on the face... But it's working anyway."
1,HC- NOT !,"No electronics are currently using this type of device, do not buy unless you have recently purchased new technology."
5,"""Their voices burst with telling""",A timely piece of art. Asian American X is a collection of voices that will at times bring you to tears and at others cause a smile to wash across your face. This work is a beautiful glimpse into contemporary Asian America and reveals a richness and variety in American culture that is all too often neglected or forgotten. Read Asian American X and I guarantee you that you will never look at Asian America the same way again.
5,and I thought I was alone...,"I found this book immensly moving. It's not really because the quality of the writing is all that good. There aren't any deep or poignant metaphors, just real life. I think that's more important than anything. What I liked most about this collection of voices is that I found I related to exactly what people said. I wanted to read more about their lives just to learn more about mine. I recommend it to anyone, Asian or not."
3,misrepresentation,"The quality and thought put into each essay was excellent, though it could've been more diverse class and wealth wise.While there is an obvious effort by the editors to include South/Southeast/East Asians and Pacific Islanders in order to represent diversely, there seems to have been a lackluster effort to include young APIA voices who are of college-age, but not in college. This would've broaden perspectives, assuming that most of them come from less educated and poorer backgrounds, exposing ideas, thoughts, and desires less uniform.This a collection of APIA voices in college - hopefully, the editors will make better efforts to broaden the collection if they decide to create a second book."
5,Deservedly a classic,"Roots' book is a marvelously readable account of the uprising of the mid-1600s, with detailed and convincing discussions of political and intellectual trends, and memorable portraits of the major personalities. The book's interpretations have generally held up well over time, although Coward's The Stuart Age (2nd ed) is an excellent, more recent companion."
5,abc's of reloading,this is a good book for the beginning reloader. it goes through all the steps that are essential for reloading and gives alot of information towards the safety aspect of reloading. starting into reloading this is a great book to start with
3,Not much new information,"If you know the history of the world or architecture there is very little extra information to gather. Also, I am dissappointe that the book skips several major blockbuster cities. such as number ONE;...EPHESUS!!!!!!, number two; CORINTH, number three;LECHAEUM, four;PERGAMUN, five;MEROE, six;SBEITLA, seven;LEPTIS MAGNA, eight;AXUM, nine;GREAT ZIMBABWE, ten;NAPATA et.al."
2,An Old TA Book,"First of all, this book is not on technical analysis, it is on analysis of chart patterns. Today, technical analysis is more developed and detailed. It is hard to understand why someone wants to read this expensive old book rather than a newer well organized technical analysis book."
1,Can cause problems,"Not a safe product. Can cause problems - such as headaches, weakness, etc. It seems that extract of artichoke leaf blocks one of the enzymes involved in cholesterol metabolism.Labeling is also not done professionally - you can see the full list of ingredients from the back of the label, only when you peel it off.."
5,Whole in 1,"Whoa! this album is off the hook! All the songs are tight, hot and blazin', All the artist are damn good. This joint is hot and it definitely worth puttin' up the loot for it...So what r u waitin' 4 Go grab one... PEACE"
3,Good book - Bad print,"I chose to buy this book because i knew it was a good one. And it is good. Although it's part of the ""Magical Philosophy"" series, i consider it a complete magickal manual by itself.However, the quality of the print is nearly unacceptable. Muddy.. Not so pleasant to read and it's even difficult to distinguish small-sized symbols.I wonder whether the printing quality of this book is really that bad or if i just received a ""bad batch"".Your comments are welcome."
5,Moonshadow,I agree with the other reviewer. NOT a novice book by any means. Excellent if you are already well studied in Magick. It was originally a set of five volumes. They have re-released the first three and are finishing the last two right now.
3,Its Okay,It has a couple of good tracks it felt like someone would like it more if they were there live
4,Not OK but.....,"I have a Makita sliding miter saw. Don't get this dual line laser guide because it doesn't fit even with the thin washer that's included in the kit. The two laser discs rub up against the safety blade housing and renders them useless. However, buy the single line laser and it works quite well but you have to install the slim washer or make one yourself since it doesn't come with this kit. As others have noticed, the cut with the single line laser is about 1/16"" off center but you get used to this. Avenger should include the various washers with both kits."
3,Only for the N64!,"If you are purchasing this version thinking that it will help you beat any version other than the Nintendo 64 version, you will be disappointed. In addition, you'd better have excellent close-up vision to make sense of the small illustrations. Check this book out at a brick-&-morter store BEFORE you order it here to confirm that it's worth you hard earned sheckles."
1,**NOT** for the Playstation (no matter what they say),"I have a Playstation. This book is pretty much useless to me. The grey-scale maps have very poor detail for one thing. For another, anything having to do with the Playstation version is treated as an exception. I had really hoped for lovely, detatiled maps to help me through the various topological levels in the game, but this book didn't provide that. The walk-throughs appear to have been written with the N64 version in mind. It was a waste of my money."
4,birds loved it....,"not much to say, but gave this as a gift and was told the birds loved it. So, guess it was a good product."
3,Bizarre Tale,"This story takes a bizarre look at a troubled man searching for his personal identity. He seems to be faced with a life of doom and gloom, especially when he begins turning into a bug!!! Even more bizarre is the relatively nonchalant way in which his family reacts. Definitely a good read considering how short it is, but I'm not convinced that I learned any great lesson or even understood the author's purpose. Perhaps the deep philosophical meaning was lost on me... Sometimes I feel like my brain is that of a cockroach!"
5,Macabre,"This book lives inside me like a dark, unwholesome quasi-sexual dream. If you don't live out Kafka's novels, you never understand them. The graphic lucidity of the opening scene grips one, and the first paragraph is etched in my mind like a song. Kafka was so intent on getting this right that he drew pictures of the insect. Try play-acting the opening scene and imagining you are the insect...I believe Kafka did this. From the juxtaposition of Gregor's morbid ""mouldy cheese eating ritual"" to the final scene where his sister jumps in the air as a healthy blossoming girl, one is spellbound by Kafka's complete understanding of his self-hatred."
5,Strange,This just might be the strangest book I have ever read. Mercifully it is a short one. It is a must read.
5,Still a favorite,"This music is fresh, witty and fun. About half the time when I'm listening to shuffle play in iTunes and a Swirling Eddies song comes up I wind up going out of shuffle and listening to all their songs I have. Recommended!"
4,VERY FUNNY and VERY FUN,"Yes this is a cool listen although not for everyone. Great for those long road trips to break up the boredom. I only wish it would be re-released on CD. [...] bucks (that's 50-fifty George Washington's) is a bit steep for a lost Beatles album much less these guys so lets get one released for the common folk, me. My wife's old cassette is shot so we need an affordable CD...or another good cassette, LP...78...45...reel to reel...8-track...anything!!!"
5,YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!,"Dont even hesitate to purchase this CD. [...], there IS NO BAD SONG on the album!! I heard about this band in a local San Diego music tabloid and decided to see their live show [...] one night - because of their previous credentials. They were one of the best live bands ive ever seen (out of hundreds of concerts)!! The chemistery between these 4 is remarkable - something real special. Easy listening and Very hard to get sick of!"
4,"Oh, how can this be bad?","Right, first things first; by comparing this to Blind Melon, you are doing UT a serious injustice. Not to say that Blind melon were bad - Soup is one of my top ten albums ever - but UT are uterly different. For a start, there is very little in the way of the first BM album's Funk Rock. Secondly, there is little in the way of Soup's comedic and piognant moments. What we've got here is [failure to communicate?] a straight up, good times rock and roll album with definite shades of Jane's Addiction, The Pumpkins (picture AM Radio with Corgan and more metal...Nice) Cheap Trick, Zeppelin... And no Hoon. The voice on this album is truly deserving it's own category, and should not be dismissed as a Hoon-a-like. Buy this for classic rock. Simple as that."
4,niiiiiice,"If you are buying this album hoping for a continuation of Blind Melon's music, you are an ass.High quality music & lyrics. A shame they broke up during the writing of a second album.Ethereal rock, nicely layered. Excellent mood music.Listen also to: Mercury Rev"
1,Blind Melon it is not,"This was an awful display of what happens when the soul of your band has passed on. The music is bland and boring. The voice of the singer is awful. Thank god Shannon doesn't have to hear what his band has moved on to do. If you buy this hoping to hear a continuation of blind melon, you will be extremely disappointed."
1,This Book is Supposed To Be. Free Publication - Even says so inside!,"Not only is this title so badly scanned to make it wholly unreadable,, but according to the blurb inside, it states that this is a scanned book by Google, and is not only out of copyright, but that it should be only for free individual use, and not be abused by commercial organisations.Why then is amazon charging $8 for this?I shall be contacting Both Google and Amazon regarding this."
1,Unit does not last!,I have had two of these units. The first one died a month after the warranty and was cheaper to buy a new one at reduced cost. The second one lasted 6 months and died. Not real reliable for a back-up server!I recommend you find something else.
2,There are better and cheaper solutions.,"Interesting. I'm not so sure why I would want to limit myself with a single drive solution that is nothing more than a fancy PC. In my case, I need more storage capacity that is easily expandable. At CES, I saw these guys with the Yellow Machine that integrated 1TB RAID-5 storage + 8-port LAN switch + router + firewall + parental controls + backup. All for $1595. I can't wait to get my hands on one!"
5,"If you need to relax, this is the video for you.","If you like the music of Enya and Capercaillie (without the vocals), the music on this video is perfect for you. The video takes the viewer around the Welsh countryside. Relaxing scenes of waterfalls and the flora and fauna of Wales fill the video. Don't expect a tour guide or a geography or history lesson - just a quiet ""walk through the countryside."""
3,Not His Best Work,"I'm a huge BeBe Winans fan. I love him and his family. I think they are one of the most talented families in Gospel. However, I don't think this is BeBe's best effort. I've bought all of his CD's since he began a solo career and I like both of the other releases better than this one. It's some good material, but the delivery is almost boring. Certainly not the stuff a live recording is made of. But, as a fan, I will continue to buy and listen to his music. Like I said, I'm a huge fan."
3,This might as well have been a studio album,"While I have been a BeBe fan for a long time, I must admit that this album does not live up to the expectations of a ""Live"" album. With the exception of ""It All Comes Down To Love"" and ""Humpty Dumpty"", BeBe sounds like he is standing in a studio with headphones and a music stand in front of him. If you are going to sing previously released material, you have to add something new to grab the listener. Whether it is a story, a testimonial, or a minute or two of ad-libbing. Give the listener something new and different. For the most part, he sings all of the previously released songs exactly as they appeared on the previous albums without much deviation. This is a nice gospel album, but fails at being a live gospel album."
5,Streamer Fishing For Trophy Trout,"This DVD is very informative. If you want the how to of Trophy Trout Streamer Fishing, then this is for you."
1,"Alas, it's out of date","I'm certain that, like all the books in this series, this was a fine book in its time. But its time is past. There is very little at all in this book that will help any user of the newer version of Moveable Type ."
4,Better than the soundtrack,"David Arkenstone is by far one of the best in his field. It is too bad that he was not selected to do the soundtrack for the LOTRs. If you take out the songs on the soundtrack from Eyna and put them on this CD you would have a full five stars. Although this is not one of Arkenstone's best, it is very well done. If you enjoy beautiful music then you should get some of his CDs and this one would make a good start."
2,Music Inspired by Bland Middle Earth,"I heard one cut (""The Palatir"") on ""Hearts of Space"" and was enchanted. I immediately ordered the CD on Amazon.com. Alas, the rest of the CD does not live up to the ethereal beauty of that cut. The rest of the CD is soundtrack filler drivel, lacking personality and originality. Although well recorded with real strings and other instruments, his stuff sounds like John Williams redux. What a disappointment this CD is., except perhaps for the most hard core ""Ring"" fans."
3,Musica muy monocorde,He comprado ya varios titulos de David Arkenstone y este es el único que encuentro deficiente. La grabación es buena pero la musica monocorde y con poca chispa.
4,"Orchestral, New Age and Epic.","Cinematic in style , using acoustic instruments with a Celtic influence as well as keyboard synthesisers . Grand orchestrations for a heroic work of fiction . David Arkenstone and friends have created a very enjoyable interpretation of mythological times that falls in musical style between Medwyn Goodall's synth laden New Age sounds and the romance of Howard Shore's large scale Gothic/Celtic soundtrack .Not as cohesive as the Howard Shore , Leonard Rosenman or Johan De Meij compositions . There are no leitmotives or themes that recur in different forms to bind the piece as a narrative . Instead this album musically illustrates several distinct mood impressions of The Lord Of The Rings ."
5,Better than the movie Soundtrack!,"This CD is packed with powerful, beautiful instrumentals, and it brings to mind the very themes the song titles intend. Every one of them is awesome. I highly recommend it if you like music to put you in a dramatic mood."
5,"sountrack? wait, this isnt it, but it is just as good",I loved this album! I listened to it while sitting in my room. my mind was drawn into the world. I could see images from the movie with this music. this caught the mood exactly.
5,David Arkenstone Music CD,"Fantastic CD, love it! Every song is great! A little pricey, but worth every cent!"
1,Weak clothespins dissapoint,HelloThose of you who enjoy drying clothes on a line may be tempted to upgrade your clothes pins beyond the classic wooden design available everywhere but don't buy this item. The pins are annoying to use with bad ergonomics. They tend to twist in your fingers so that you almost need two hands to clip them on the line. On top of that they look less durable than the wooden classics.
2,not quite what I was hoping for...,"I purchased clothespins similar to these when I was living in Fort Riley, Kansas. They were the only thing that held my clothes on the line in the high winds there. I haven't been able to find anything even close since I moved out of Kansas. I was so excited when I found these...they look exactly like the ones I had purchased previously. Unfortunately, these have some construction flaws...the spring is poor quality and awkwardly situated in the clothespin. I worry that the springs will fall right off if I'm not careful. I won't buy these again and am still looking for the ones I found in Kansas. :("
1,Terrible!,These are terrible...every one broke in less than one summer. Design is not good - spring comes off of all of them.
3,plastic clothes pins,"I have been using plastic pins for some time now. I find them to be very helpful. They don't put the little midew spots on your clothes that wooden pins do. The only thing I don't like about them is that they eventually degrade and break at worst times. I used to be able to get larger, more colorful plastic clothes pins, but these are pretty good."
5,Delightful Music/Stories from the Tzadic catalogue,"First heard Shelly Hirsch on Zorn's The Big Gundown - I thought her vocal gymnastics were from Yma Sumac - then I heard her wonderfully wacky (and a little naughty) Pussycat on the Tzadic tribute album to Burt Bacharach. Hirsch's song cycle to her best friend Aida (pronounced Ada) at the beginning of the CD spanning several songs is well worth the cost of the CD. It is incredibly layered, and personal, musical, and emotionally moving. I'm not as thrilled by a couple of the songs which indulge in that wacky, kitschy, New York Jewess voice that was so annoyingly captured by Fran Drescher - but they are fortunately shortlived and the CD moves onto better ground. Hirsch has an amazing ear for little detail - a typewriter, a birdsong, etc."
4,Laura:...,"This book is a very good general view of freud's ideas, theories, and views. I would recommend it if you are just stating out. It has clear language too. However it is not terribly indepth so be forewarned that it may not meet all needs. It is a good general resource though."
4,Cramming Freud,"An interesting and informative reader on the works of Sigmund Freud which should assist the lay reader who does not require too much detail. For the professional reader it is a quick and handy guide/refresher on the important things that Freud wrote. Storr's approach is lively and succinct. He helps us to understand Freud and his thinking by example, illustration and critique. He also shows us the progression of Freud's work and the development of psychoanalysis as we know it today. This short introduction is an excellent achievement in condensation of the Standard Editions."
2,too much opinion mixed with good information on Freud.,I thought there was too much opinion (and current thought) mixed with good information on Freud. I also found the reading a bit pompous.
4,Perfect for a fan of the series,"I ordered this naruto accessory recently and i have to say i was very impressed with my product. The Metal plate used is very strong and feels solid enough to absorb all the force of a direct punch! It needs to be bent by the user so it will fit on the individual's forehead properly. The actual fabric used for the headband feels kinda cheapand thin, but it seems to be strong and it serves its purpose. It should also be noted that you do not need to wear this on your head like everyone else, in fact it might be better to tie it around your leg or arm or something so it looks unique.If the fabric felt al ittle better, i would have given this a 5 out of 5 stars, but as it is, I'll give it 4, which is not a bad a thing."
1,Not at all what i wanted.,"The 1st picture i saw of it was the large high quality headband, But after a week the change the picture and send me this piece of crap. Not even remotely what I bought. This headband can fit my children great, but not what i wanted. thanks for the garbage. The metal on this is flimsy as hell. bends with the slightest touch. and 2 minutes after opening it the screws one the side holding the crap metal came loose. Do not buy"
1,Wrong Item Received,Unfortunately I did not receive Rock Lee's headband but another one froma different Naruto Chraracter. My son discarded it quickly. it just wasn't worth returning.
3,5 days,It took a while for me to get it.5 days to be exact. Overall the product is good. And I cant really complain about it
3,kool,wow it looks.....unique um but they should make it available on your waist i mean kids under seven are the target market
1,The decline of thinking.,"Amongst great literature and investigative books there must certainly be a place for junk like this. Teach the young to watch MTV, teach them the ""importance"" of spending days and days devoted to escapism. And oh, don't forget to reward the authors with your hard earned money."
4,A Great Book for Anyone Interested in Moviemaking,"I really like this book. Michael Dean is one of those people who writes like you are sitting in the room with him just having a beer and talking. After reading this book, and keeping it as a reference, I have decided to try my hand at filmmaking. I prefer Digital these days because of my hedonistic nature. I don't shoot film in still cameras very often either. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a no nonsense ""film education.""Be sure to take a look at his website too to see what is going on in his life. Thanks Michael for a great book!"
1,I spent even $20 for this? Why?,"I admit that I didn't read down to the 1 star reviewers before buying this book and maybe you won't either. Had I read their reviews, I may never have bought this piece of junk and you might not either. I think the people who gave it higher reviews are either the author's friends or the truly naive. If you are looking for the slacker's guide to film making this is the book for you. And about that CD. There are a couple of items that you can get elsewhere and lots of pictures of his girlfriend (I guess) and a collection of lame slacker videos. Your money is better spent on gaffer's tape."
4,Excellent Guide for the Beginning Filmmaker,"I've owned both editions of $30 Film School and also have a copy of the author's documentary, DIY or DIE. It's all good stuff. This ain't Hollywood filmmaking we're talking about here . . . the idea behind this book is to take whatever you got ($300 MiniDV Cam from Wal-Mart? Great, that will work) and make a good film. So if you're just getting started and are ready to make your NO BUDGET film then this book is a great place to start."
4,To DIY or not to DIY,"If you want to DIY, this tells you how and why, and inspires you to do it. If that's not the route you want to go, this will show you how it's done so you can participate in and control your project and those you hired. If you're just curious, this should answer a lot of questions -- you'll watch the next film differently. A fun and informative read"
4,You'll want to make your own movie after reading this,A very good book. Very inspirational. I read it straight through in less than a week. You'll want to make your own movie after reading this.
1,Hard to Finish,This book was just too hard to finish. The author was doing more axe grinding at hollywood's poor treatment of him than actually telling you how to make a film.
5,Great for DIY Filmmaking!,"$30 Film Scool will no doubt serve as a great handbook for filmmakers who don't have a big budget! The preview for my film ""What is INDIE?"" (which was made in part with the help of the 1st edition of this book) is on the bonus DVD that accompanies the second edition, and I have already received phone calls from other filmmakers complimenting it!"
5,Great book! Cheapest & Best film school,"MW Dean's book $30 FS is great for beginners, itermediates, or people who need to brush up on basic film making techniques. Very in depth, especially in regards to how to promote, and get your film projected, duplicated,etc. I thought I knew everything, then I picked up this book. Great buy!"
4,ISE,"If you're trying to buy this book for much cheaper than this, send me a text at (909) 575-8647. I just completed a course which used this book, the book is hard back and still in good shape."
2,"It does not seem as relavant today, but still has sound idea","The book does not depict enough information about computers in todays changing world. For the Price of the book, It is most likely a regret. But the basic and indepth ideas are worth every penny."
3,Written by an Engineer for Engineers: Factual but ZZz.zZZzz...,I guess this is the engineering student's nightmare. You would have to slug through a book with numbers and concepts minus the presentation. It's a good book for the subject matter if you can bear the torture.
3,The end of Post-Rock?,"Although pleasant enough, ""Whatever, Mortal"" gets as tiresome near the end as its silly title might indicate. Post-rock seems to be eating its own young, as it reverts to a country/folk pastiche. I am sorry to say that I thought ""Shark Cage"" was a lot better. It spoke toward the possibilities of new forms of music working themselves out. Papa M, in his latest release, just seems to be spending too much time hanging out with Will Oldham and his Appalachian foothill people, listening to Hank."
3,Leonard Cohen's Blues,"This album sounds in spots like a young Leonard Cohen as Mojo Magazine had stated. It's a good album, but some of the songs are jeopardized by a sophomoric sense of humor which is a shame. Examples, ""Over Jordan"" - a parody/cover of trad. ""Wayfaring Stranger"", where Pajo states he's a whore traveling stranger. The song ""Sorrow Reigns"" is ruined by the introductory couplet, ""Sara Jane sorrow reigns blue, there was something like a wall between us, that stopped you going down on my penis."" Ugh. Standout tracks include: ""Beloved Woman"", ""Glad You're Here With Me,"" and ""The Unquiet Grave.""Recently David Pajo - Papa M- has joined Billy Corgan in his new band Zwan as a bassist. He now goes by the name Skullfisher. I can't wait. One more thing, ignore all other reviews especially from people with poor taste in music like the other individual who reviewed this travesty."
1,Useless as history.,"The new Amazon format forces the above number rating.This reviewer objects.Mr. Peters is able to recollect the ""well sculpturedbutts"" of other soldiers very effectively, but hisother memories of World War II are faulty. Hejumbles dates and events, mislabels units, quoteswildly inaccurate statistics and anachronisticconversations (paratrooper berets in 1943?) andclaims ""D-Day jitters"" despite apparently havingarrived in Europe some months too late for thathistoric event. The Brits have a useful term forthis: ""a dog's breakfast"".Peters' erotic musing will find their audience,but military history readers will not take seriouslya work which claims ""O.D."" stands for ""off duty""."
4,A behind-the-lines WWII cog's terrors,"Nothing earth-shaking happens in the foreground of this brief (but intense) memoir of repressed longing and suppressed fear of a Wisconsin farmboy who was in the army but not in comabt during WWII. It may well make a mess of military chronology, but the feelings ring true. Peters wanted a kind of camraderie that was and remains forbidden in the American military. Typically of ""the great generation,"" he desperately wanted to marry and to hide homoerotic desires. He received vicarious excitement from another clerk-typist bolder than he, who was acting on his homoerotic desires (and survived through his term of duty). The hard-scrabble existence of his Wisconsin childhood is also vividly and economically recalled."
1,Gay literature,"I'm a WWII buff and a published author. I thought I was buying a book I might be able to refer to in my next book; instead, I received a book on the experiences of a gay soldier. The writer made it seem as if everyone in the military were gay, which I believe was not the case. If you're gay, you'll like the book. Otherwise, skip it. It's not even that well written."
2,Useless CD,"No matter how dumb you think your readers are, you should not stick a CD with a trojan in the back of the book!I'll admit I found a copy of this book for a good price ($8.50), and eventhough I have C# 2008, I thought this would be an inexpensive way to get up to speed. At least avast! thinks it contains a virus, and disabled the CD drive. When I tried the website referenced in the book, it contained no reference to the book. (What FAQs?).It will be a long time, probably forever, before I purchase another Dummies book."
4,good intro,"Pretty standard Dummies book. I almost always learn a lot from them, and this one was no exception. It covers all the object oriented standards- encapsulation, classes, enumeration, etc. with lots of good examples and little overly confusing syntax. Mildly flippant, as standard for the informal tone of the series, but while rarely very funny it does help keep it light. If you're wanting a joke book this isn't it, in other words, but it does the job for an intro to C#.My only real complaint, as often seems to be the case with cd's in books, was that a lot of the licenses or something had expired and I wasn't able to run anything. For a programmer I'm pretty clunky at techy things, but I think this wasn't my fault. Still a good book- much more detail than ""Learning in the Key of c#"", for example. Probably the Head First is a better overall learning book than this one, but you can get through Dummies a lot faster."
4,A decent book but definitely for beginners only,"This is one of two books I read to get my introduction to C#, and I feel like since then I have been pretty successful. The book had actually has a very decent coverage of Object Oriented Programming. My only complaint really is the amount of humor that is interjected into the text, which I suppose is a hallmark of the ""for Dummies"" series of books. The humor is kind of cool and funny at first, but after a while it starts to get in the way of the subject matter. Not enough to inhibit learning, just enough to be a little annoying. Having said that though, this book did help me get started and, like I said, I have been pretty successful since then so I have to give the book at least four stars."
2,There are betters out their,"The only real advantage to this dictionary is its Plastic cover, which makes it portable and water-resistant. Other than that, it is only confusing and innacurate. Allright for beginners, I would not recommend it for anyone who can actually *speak* spanish."
1,buyer beware!!!!,"This book is written in Greek, not English for the Gospel portion. The second half is a ""colometry and annotations"" which is in English but seems to be mainly explanations of the Greek words and contains Greek phrases. I noticed nothing on the website to warn me about this!!! Since I don't read Greek or speak it the book is worthless to me. There were some other Gospels of Mark by Fr. Kleist which mention English sense lines so I thought this was the same book since sometimes books are listed several times on Amazon. Wow, was I mistaken."
4,Underrated and often imitated,"This is not a bad collection of Mr. Walker's. These cuts let you know just why he could open a show for any Motwon artist as well as close the show for them as well. Featured cuts include: Shotgun, Cleos Back and many others. This is just another reason why I keep apllying for jobs at recod companies but, I am beginning to thinkl they don't want the good stuff out in the market. Junior is best when you hear him live or through analog. Oh yeah, he's funky. His sax riffs can be heard on so many artist under the Motown banner it is simply ridiculous that he did not get more acclaim during his time at Motown. This is a great place to start for the novice, and for those of you that just want to go back down memory lane. This collections flows almost as good as the compilations I make, almost, anyway get this CD for some serious soulful up tempo tenor sax grooving. YOu can't miss with this one. Many a party stayed funky with Junior blowing his sax, you can believe that."
5,Jr. Walker & The All Stars,"My grandfather could blow that saxaphone! Where did he get the air or the energy? I just love his music!Many accolades and awards are due him. I plan to uphold his name so that his legacy lives on!Buy his music and continue to ""Shake and Fingerpop!"""
3,Mr Shotgun,This is a great collestion of Junior Walker's work. I like many of his songs and the way he play the saxophone. He plays good versions of songs from other motown greats. I think shotgun is his best song.
5,Another Great Marma and Heath Collection.,"This is another Great Collection of Classic Heathcliff and Marmaduke Shorts although not as long as Doggone Cat Tales, it is still a surefire winner. i wish this title was also on DVD Shout or Warners get the ball rolling on this one please, a fan. 60 mins of fun that kids we'll enjoy.Highly Recommended For Kids ."
4,good gift idea,This was ordered as a baby shower gift. It was received on time and in good condition. It's a fun gift idea.
3,Some great chants,"I love working out with this disc. My favorite chant is Bhava Bhaya Harana - Sita - theres something about it that's just mesmerizing (sp). I'd recommend this for anyone who enjoys yoga, stretching and meditation."
2,Eh,"I bought this CD hoping to use it for my yoga classes -- but it's not really what I was hoping for. To me it's just a bit too repetitive, and the children singing in the background are a bit... well, annoying. I will say that it is upbeat and happy, but I didn't find it inspiring or motivating."
5,A passionate reading of the Brahms Sonatas,"Khitruk and Korevaar deliver a moving and powerful performance. There are many CD's available, but if you buy only one, this is the one to have."
1,Too big in the wrong places!,"This style is very loose around the side of the breasts which makes it non-wearable. I gave it to someone much bigger than me, and while the rest was tight it was still cut in a way where the side of the breasts hang out. A sports bra underneath does not look or fit right. The only reason I did not return it was because it would have cost almost as much to ship it back as to keep it. It is well made though and the fabric and color are great. Maybe it is just the way it fits me."
3,"Good idea, not such a good product","3 days after the warranty ran out, the phone started acting up. This was purchased for my 88-year old mother who is losing her sight, but otherwise very active and very healthy. We feel like we have wasted the money. The volume is iffy (both on her end and on mine)...we have replaced batteries, but it has not helped. The ring tones available are not suitable for anyone with much hearing loss. We will replace this phone with a much more expensive one."
4,Nice for low vision needs,"I bought the phone for my mother who is 90 and has macular degeneration. The numbers are big and resonably simple to use. I especially like that it announces who is calling. I wish it had more ""one button"" speed dialing options available but the emergency 911 button is wonderful. Overall, a very good phone."
3,Uniden CEZA1998 5.8 GHZ,The only problem with this phone is that is does not have a light of any sort advising that you have an incoming call message. Which means you have to turn on lights or go over to phone to see is you have a CID message.
4,Great Phone But---------,The phone is great but doesnt have a feature that lets you know when a message is waiting on voice mail. My old phone had a red blinking lite to alert us to a message.Other than that the phone is great.
3,base set has only room for four #'s,It's a good phone but the draw back is the base unit can only store four phone numbers.The remote stores more which is stupid being the base unit is the main phone in our house and the remote is in another room.I phone out more than people phone in so I cannot store the 50 #'s it can memorize I now have to use my phone book.
4,Good phone,Good phone with pretty good featuresI am hard of hearing and it has been greatLove the caller anounce featureOnly con is you get some static sometimes with the handheld amplification on.Other than that My wife and I have been happy
4,Great phone!,"I'm not really hearing or vision impaired, other than what turning 50 does to you, but I found that I couldn't read the caller id window on my old phone anymore. The display on this phone is easy to read, and you can't miss the fact that its ringing, what with the lights and loud ringer and all. Really easy to set up, too. Heed this warning - disable the red button that dials 911 automatically unless you really, really need it. I was plugging the phone in and accidentally hit the button. Two minutes later, National 911 called. Twenty minutes later, the State Police called. Two hours later, the State Police came to my door to follow up. I told the callers and the officer at my door what happened, but I recommend avoiding the embarrassment all together - disable the button."
1,Biggest P.O.S. on the planet...,"Set the phone, and then everything died. Nothing worked. After waiting on hold for 26 minutes with Uniden CS, I was told to send back for repair. Are you kidding?Am returning and never buying a Uniden product again. First and last time..."
1,Didn't work,"I received the telephone, went through all the work of setting it up...and the display for the caller ID message did not work. I packed it up and sent it back."
2,It didn't work,"I bought this product for my parents who live in another country (Romania) after much research and it seemed to fit all my needes; I receieved it very fast and when I saw it I was very happy: indeed, it was what I needed. However, after installing it back there it with much fanfare, many features didn't work. It didn't hold the date (after setting the date, it was turning back to flashing) and the answering machine didn't work at all. I couldn't bring it back to return it because I came back through other countries so I couldn't carry it and therefore I just lost the money. My mom said though that she could hear better when talking on this phone than on others. At least one thing was good."
5,Consumer Reports,"Phone is reviewed briefly in the October 2006 issue, on page 56, of Consumer Reports Magazine."
4,happy daughters,"We purchased this phone for our parents. So far, they really like it and Mom can hear quite well while using it. I have noticed at times when the portable is used, their voices can fade in and out briefly. That could be related to Dad moving around while speaking, but he wasn't far from the base. On a funny note, Christmas Day Dad accidentally pushed the red 911 button several times. The operator called them back and asked if they had gotten a new telephone for a gift. The placement of this button shouldn't be where your hand holds the portable."
3,Uniden CEZA1998 5.8 GWZ Phone System,Phones did everything ads said they wouldSound was loud enough and clear for hard of hearingAnswer machine was nice.My wife's only problem was the buttons on the phonewere confusing. But my daughter was going to buy usa similiar phone that cost 4 times more than the Unidenand the Unider came out working better than the other phone.Uniden CEZAI998 5.8 GHz Cordless Phone with Corded Base and Digital Answering SystemJack
4,"A good, serviceable phone with great features","The Uniden CEZAI998 is a very easy phone to set up. For us older folks it has nice large buttons and an easy-to-read display with great sound and clarity for incoming calls. I would, however, prefer that the handset of the cordless phone provide better ""side tone"" to hear my own voice during calls and that it also have a speakerphone capability. In addition, the flat white plastic construction shows kitchen residue if not wiped down repeatedly. Overall, I would recommend this phone for people who want the features important to those with less than perfect sight and hearing while giving the freedom of a cordless phone in addition to the base unit with speakerphone."
4,uniden phone,The phone has answered all our needs I do have two minor complaints. Not enough space for storing phone numbers and a telephone cord that is much too short. Had to go to Walmart to get a longer cord.Do love the phone though.
2,Could be great,"This machine could be great, large keys and great features, but the only small keys are the most important and most used keys. Good luck finding and using the replay, play, skip, and erase keys. Had to glue beeds on these keys for my Mom to use the phone."
4,It serves its purpose!,"I like this phone, because it serves its purpose. It's looks nice, although all the red lights that alert you of an incoming call, reminds me of a siren on a police car. As previous customers have stated, it is ideal for older adults. I also like the fact one is corded and the other is cordless, which is the primary reason why I bought it."
4,EZ Dial Phone,The phone is fine with the exception of the 911 button on the cordless phone set. I bought this for my parents and they have had to stop using it because they have called the police out by accident several times. The red 911 call button is located in a place where it is easily touched when trying to hold the phone to dial or listen. My parents local police told them to get another phone!!!!!Otherwise all the other features work very well!
2,Large Button Cordless Phone,"I like the idea that the phone makers are addressing the needs of older people. Although I don't consider myself old (60), I know the time is coming for more assists in telephoning. I like the idea of a lit-up phone pad with larger numbers and as I get older and my hearing is not so good, I can see the flashing ringer would be beneficial. I also liked the one-button emergency 911 number. What I was not crazy about was the design, but most importantly, the caller ID announcer isn't clear. From across the room or even close up, you cannot understand what is being said."
3,Check features before you buy!,"This is definitely a nice device for the money. It has nice features and the documentation is easy to understand.HOWEVER - there's no MUTE button on either the corded phone or the cordless handset. I purchased this phone for my home office, and I spend a lot of time on conference calls. I was simply horrified to find out that there was no way to mute the speaker - that's such a standard feature it really doesn't make sense. But I contacted the vendor and they confirmed the lack of feature. So, if you do a lot of conference calling or have noisy kids or animals at your house, make sure the conference facility you use allows muting via a keyboard entry because otherwise you'll have to put a pillow over the phone to keep out the background noise. I'd give this a ""5"" if not for this feature, but it's a BIG miss."
3,Uniden Large Button Cordless phone,This phone is good except for the speaker on the corded phone. When talking it fades then comes back. It's annoying.
5,Great phone!,Perfect condition ~ exactly as pictured ~ excellent price ~ totally pleased with purchase and delivery.
3,Uniden CEZAI998 EZ-Dial Large Button Cordless Phone with Caller ID,"I purchased this phone for my elderly parents. The corded base unit is working well and has many good features that assist those hard of hearing and is hearing aid compatible. The cordless phone also has helpful features, however, after a minute or so, the volume of the person speaking on the other end fades drastically and you can no longer hear them. I'm going to check into this and hopefully get a replacement. If all was working properly I would give the phone combo a 4 star rating."
3,"Product is good, package was missing needed items","This phone is great for my elderly, hearing impaired father. However, the package was missing the phone cords! I emailed Amazon for help to correct the problem. Amazon was prompt to reply, only to inform me I needed to communicate with Uniden directly for the parts. A convenient means to purchase has become quite a hassle! :("
3,disappointed with performance,The phone was disappointing. It is very difficult for people to hear me and it sounds like I'm talking into a dead phone. I find that I'm yelling to have a normal conversation which is aggrevating. Positive points are that the numbers are large and it is easy to get up and running. I need another phone for my house and I would not purchase another and I would not recommend this model to friends.
1,Disappointed with defective product,"I ordered this phone for my dad to replace the phone he'd had for twenty years. I thought it would be great since I saw it reviewed in Consumer Reports, it has a lot of useful features and I'd had a Uniden cordless for several years. This phone has been a let-down and a hassle, though, since after he's been talking on the phone for 15 minutes or so, the volume starts to fade out to the point that he can barely hear the person on the other end of the line. He can adjust the volume initially, but it keeps fading nonetheless. I can verify that this is not related to his hearing either since I've tried it myself. We did some troubleshooting and nothing worked, so I thought it was perhaps just one defective phone and got Uniden to send a new one (another $10). Now the problem is happening again on the second phone. I would not order this model again and particularly not for anyone who has any kind of hearing problem."
2,Lousy audio performance,"I've had this phone for a month so it's quirks are well defined. I am surprised at the poor quality of both the receiver and the CID announce. I mostly use the main unit and rate the quality of the sound coming from the earpiece at 4- on a scale of ten. I would not have purchased the phone if I had experienced the receiver's tinny sound. This is particularly irksome given the phone's senior friendly advertisement.The computer generated voice for the caller ID announce is like something from a 70's B grade sci-fi movie. It's so bad that it's kind of comical, and often undescipherable. The keypad and all other functions are nice, well designed and comfortably arranged. If I had purchased this for my parents, I'd return it due to the lousy sound quality. What I do like about this phone, plus inertia, outweighs the trouble of return and reselection....just."
3,I returned it,"My father-in-law wears hearing aids and can only hear on the phone by taking 1 hearing aid out and using a highly applified headset. He wanted a portable phone, so I got him this one based on the description.I returned it. I doesn't get much louder than a regular adjustable portable phone, and not even close to as loud as his old corded phone.Bad product description. Otherwise, the phone appeared to be okay, though I didn't play with it much."
2,Range of phone,This product has absolutely no range from the base unit. Very disappointed with this performance.
2,Pretty But Not Well-Constructed,Ordered two for my bedroom. The harp doesn't fit well and has popped out a couple of times. We don't really use them often for that reason.
1,junk,"parts made in china very poor material quality and hard to install springs do not last I have to replace them after two weeks of use,dont waste your time or money"
5,"Easy to wear, works great","No complaints at all. This is very comfortable to wear which is very important. Its quite thin which is OK, neck protectors don't need to be thick to stop welts. It only needs to prevent direct contact with the skin. Recommended 100%."
3,Thin but comfortable,"I got this and while it is very comfortable to wear, it is really thin and will provide only minimal protection of a neck shot. Maybe this the way it is suppose to be but I still keep my head tucked in during engagements in paintball."
3,Never got shot in the neck,So I can't for sure say how good it protects. I will say that I was suprised how narrow the strap was and that parts of my neck were still exposed while wearing it so I'm not sure how will it will protect when a ball does come flying at it.
3,Very thin,"After purchasing other paintball protective gear like pants and vests, I expected there to be a little more to the neck protector. It basically feels like a single layer of neoprene with the edges hemmed. Much more thin than I expected. We'll see how well it works after playing today."
2,"Might be good, but hard to follow.","I have mixed feelings about this book, but overall it didn't work for me. On the plus side the author has a unique vision, the book has some intriguing imagery, & St. Thomas More's reaction to the time traveller was priceless. The problem was that I didn't know who was saying what or what was going on. That may only be 1 problem, but it's a big one. Also I think this is a metaphor rather than a future world or time traveller story. That I don't mind. As a Catholic who loves science fiction I really wanted to like this. Oh well enjoy the scenery & here's hoping you'll have better luck following it. If Amazon'll allow I heard Lafferty doesn't entirely believe the theory of evolution. I think that's cool since the more beliefs represented in SF the better as far as I'm concerned."
3,Buyer beware - same set as Martial Arts 20 Pack only less 4 movies,"For the collectors, fans of older martial arts films, or fans of supposedly ""public domain"" collections; this is the same exact set put out by Mill Creek one year ago under the title ""Martial Arts 20 Movie Pack"", only with four less films.I picked this up on an impulse since I found it dirt cheap but it wasn't until I got it home I realized I already had them.Although I haven't actually compared the print quality (which I'm sure hasn't changed) the only obvious omission besides losing 4 movies is Jimmy Wang Yu's film ""Screaming Ninja"". It is listed as 101 minute runtime on the previous set while on this one the box refers to it as ""Screaming Tiger"" with a runtime of 74 minutes. Knowing Mill Creek, neither is right.I would avoid picking this up unless you don't already own the previously mentioned set or can find it really, really cheap like I did."
1,HORRIBLE,"THIS MOVIES SUCKED, PLAIN AND SIMPLE.WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY.GOOD THING I CAN TRADE IN WITH AMAZON."
5,Easy to install and does the job!,Bought it as a replacement popper. Took two screws and was installed in a couple minutes. Same look and quality I recieved from the autoloc company a few years ago.
4,The POP in blue,"The first time I've ever heard Atomic Swing I was really surprised because of their great guitars and their magnificent style. Recently I listened again the old discos of A.S. and I find a new point of view. The vocals, the lyrics and the atmosphere that creates this classic band I'm sure will make you squeeze. Come on and try it. It is very easy. Don't go on without listening STONE ME INTO THE GROOVE."
4,A quiet novel about a young woman that opens your eyes.,"Erica García is a young, working-class, coffee-drinking Puerto Rican lesbiana who drives clunky covertibles, has a girlfriend and works the nigh shift as an aide at the Training School for the Reterded. This novel, Mariana's first, explores the protagonist's familial, economic, cultural and lesbian connections by focusing on Erica's inner world while she lives at night, cleaning, and caring for the residents in the ward. The prose is clean and fluid throughout the novel; the writing is at its best when Erica drives along the New England countryside and reflects upon her life while connecting with the seasons. It's a quiet, well-crafted novel about a young woman's seemingly simple life that opens your eyes to her inner motivations and to the situation in institutions. The author is one of the few Latina lesbians writing novels in English in this country."
4,"Vivid story, would make a great movie","In a gripping, graphic debut novel, Mariana Romo-Carmona presents a vivid look into a young woman's life as an aid in a women's institution. Here the women are constantly sedated and monitored for unexpected incontinence, yet are always treated with respect. Here living at night appears to be the only defense for a Hispanic woman in white Connecticut, surrounded by people who give her a sense of self-worth. Here is a story worth telling, and worth reading."
5,"Sounds A Bit Like a Film Score, Which is Not a Bad Thing.","When judging an album of this kind, you must try not to compare it to anything else. I believe that every other album by this group should be treated this same way, just because of the somewhat gyrating nature of their music. If one does this, The Cinematic Orchestra can never let them down when it comes to innovative music. They are one of the few groups that I have found that does not and cannot have a genre, unless that genre be their own name. Listen to all of ""Motion"" and then listen to this album and try to honestly tell me that this isn't one of the most innovative groups of our time. The only other recent groups I know of that I can compare them to are Radiohead and Jaga Jazzist (a 12 piece jazz group from Norway). That is just my educated opinion."
2,The dreaded 'introspective period'. Let's hope he snaps out of it.,"The first reviewer hits the nail on the head. I rate The Cinematic Orchestra as one of the best, most interesting bands to come along in years. When you listen to the album 'Everyday' you realise there's no one to touch them at such heady, creative and joyous heights. Alas, on Ma Fleur the Norah Jones comparison is all too valid. If I want a collection of middle of the road, solopsistic torchsongs, then I'll buy a Damien Rice album - except why would I want to do that? Oh, and it's a soundtrack to a movie that's not been made yet? Yeah? Well, that idea's been done to death, and it doesn't make this album any less of a turkey. I await the return of the Cinematics at their majestic norm."
5,well developed,"After having heard all previous albums, I was surprised to hear the vocals - but they mesh so well with the Cinematic sound. Each song flows well from one to the next, and from the last to song back around to the first... if put on repeat...it's a fabulous concept album; a short story or perhaps a novel put to music. Listen to it forward and over again. If you like their previous outputs, and you can get into both the pop/ethereal and RnB/hip hop vocals you get here, you just may get into this.... a la Fila Brazillia's jump leads or Jazzanova's latest series of Secret Love compilations. And I love the photos included with the CD - must buy for fans."
2,Ugh........,"I found this c.d virtually pointless. The songs are irritating and repetitive, and eventually the ""upbeat"" ones sound exactly the same. Do yourself a favor, and buy the Japanese imports. if your too cheap to buy GOOD music, then at least buy Lunarock, it's the best dubbie c.d out there, because it at least includes two original Japanese songs (Moonlight Destinu and Ai no Senshi)The b.g.m.s on this c.d are nice, but, restating, nothing else is worth listening to."
3,Devout fans will like it...,"I think this album is cute, but probably not what the average fan is looking for. The CD contains some of the best songs from the (American) soundtracks, many of them remixed, plus some of the background ""muzak"" from the series - such as the exquisite pan flute melody. The background music is a nifty bonus that fans of the American series may appreciate, but this album strikes me as more of a sound effect collection than a true music album.If you're looking for some cute music, I'd say invest in the original soundtrack or ""Lunarock"". Most of the tracks listed on this CD come from the soundtrack anyway. All this album will offer is a handful of trite remixes. (The ""Sailor Moon Theme"" remix and the ""My Only Love"" remix aren't bad.)All in all, a serious Moon fan will probably appreciate this album. If you're getting it as a gift, I'd suggest throwing in a poster or shirt as a bonus."
2,A Collapsed Star,"I do enjoy most of these short introductions. As a layman interested in Philosophy I will often read one to see if I want to delve deeper into the topic being discussed. This book is analogous to a collapsed star: small, but heavy and dense. Some of the reviewers of this book seem to have significant backgrounds in Philosophy, which, to me, prompts the question ""Why read a little introductory book on the subject if you are not a novice?""I assume this is written for folks who are unfamiliar with a lot of philosophical concepts, and want a fairly easy introduction to a topic. I didn't like this book at all, and at its conclusion I decided to try again. I reached into my book case and pulled out a book on the same topic that was much bigger: ""Continental Philosophy since 1750: The Rise and Fall of the Self"", by Robert C. Solomon. Easy to read, lucid, informative and quite enjoyable. I would suggest Solomon's book to anyone wanting an introduction to this subject."
4,Interesting Read,Mr. Evans made the characters intriguing and believeable for science fiction. It makes you want to examine the Adam of the Bible.
2,God and Your Lonely Heart,"I order two copies of this book: one from Cathy's Half Price Books which was in excellent condition just as promised.The second book came from Prestonshire Books. This book was supposed to be in very good condition. However, it was aged, curled with brown edges and checkmarks throughout."
3,trifle bowl,This bowl is pretty but HEAVY. I would buy a lighter weight more delicate one next time. Great if you can handle washing it!
3,Not your typical Stu album...,"I really don't know why everybody else gave this album such high marks. I honestly agree that it is a step in a new direction for Stu, as you'll hear more jazzy tunes, and even some sort of dance-techno beats here and there, but you don't hear all of the stuntwork that you would with Kings of Sleep or The Urge. It has some good soundscapes in it, and some of the guest musicians make the album very pleasing. As far as Stu's best work, in my opinion, try picking up Kings of Sleep or The Urge [which has a surprise for you Eric Johnson fans!]. All in all, not a total waste of money, but definitely not Stu's best."
3,a little dissappointing,"I'm sorry 5-stars guys and girls. Not for me. Right now I'm in the middle of discovering the bassguitar as a solo instrument. Listening a lot to heroes like Jaco, Anthony, Victor etc, Stu had to be on my hitlist. Perhaps Outbound is not my album.This album is not a jazz/fusion kind of thing. It sounds more like sophisticated film music to me. There are some nice songs, but overall...... Although you can only admire the tapping skills of Stu, for me it's often too busy."
5,Compare then and now,It was very interesting to see the first version of the Exodus study that Kay did on Radio. It contains many of the same concepts seen in the Inductive study on Exodus.
2,South Africa - general overview,"The geography of South Africa is the main focus of this title. Within this subject too many topics are touched on for a 32 page book that is nearly 50% pictures. Each topic, including weather, plants, animals, industry, people, etc., is given a very quick overview but none are given much depth. A glossary and index are incuded. A pronounciation guide for non-English words would have been helpful. For someone interested in general information about this part of the world this is an OK choice. For someone looking for research material - keep looking."
3,Do you really need a medium?,"In this book you learn how the medium can connect you and a loved one who has passed in an easy to understand way. It is not unusual to wish to contact those who have died and the author gives the reader a sense of ""it's okay"" to want this and then to follow through. Although as a medium myself, I know and tell this to my clients, one does not need a medium to contact the dead but truth be told, a trained medium has a greater ability to clearly, without emotions in the mix, contact the dead for a more valid message. That message is usually nothing profound but can be very insightful as well as comforting. I agree to be aware of those who take advantage of grieving people and therefore personal recommendations are my suggestion."
5,Buen producto,"No dude en comprarlo. Si necesita jengibre en polvo este es maravilloso, de alta calidad para sus comidas. Comprelo sin dudar"
1,Do not buy this item,"This transmitter is useless, it gives you 8 radio stations that are in use in my area. So i cant use it. it works for 10 sec. then it turns off. So it was pretty much a waste of money for me."
4,Good for most,"My experiences, after a few weeks of owning the product and traveling from NJ to Chicago and back:It worked fine everywhere except downtown Chicago. On the south side of Chicago it worked, and it worked in Philly. In my hometown (small town), it works fine.So, based on that data, it should work fine for most people outside of cities bigger than Philly (such as NYC, LA, Chi)."
5,At last an FM transmitter that actually sounds good,"This is the 4th FM transmitter I've tried in two years. I was a bit skeptical at first, thinking I'd get the same bad reception and bad sound as the others. Griffin, Belkin and Monster also boasted great reception and good stereo output. But when I plugged my iPod into the Kensignton FM transmitter, it was a world of difference. No static noise, great reception and the best sound quality I've ever heard from one of these attachments. The quality is better than a CD. I am genuinely impressed. The Kensignton FM transmitter boasts their Aerielle wireless technology provides superior audio quality, enhanced noice reduction and excellent stereo separation. I have no idea what Aerielle technology is, but I can say, it sure works great."
3,CHECK YOUR LOCAL 85 AND107 RADIO STATIONS,"This device only operates on 85.1, 85.3, 85.5, 85.7, 107.1, 107.3, 107.5, and 107.7. If you have a radio station on OR NEXT TO one of the frequencies the quality of the device will be poor. If one of those is clear (and no station is on either side of it) this product will sound quite good."
1,Does not work,"No reception on any of the available frequencies. I live in a rural area with plenty of un-used frequencies and should have had no problem with the signal. It is a cheap piece of junk and I would never recommend it to anyone. I would give it a zero star rating, but it wasn't an option."
3,Kensington 33159 Auto Charger and FM Transmitter for iPOD,"It is very useful for charging but the FM feature I don't like a bit. Volume cannot be adjusted so the music comes out with a lot of ""noise""."
2,Not so Hot,"It isn't working out for me. The reception is terrible on all 8 possible channels and I DON'T live in a big city. Static is VERY frequent and sometimes I even get buzzing. In an old VW Bug this might be acceptable, but for any car in which you can actually hear the music, there no enjoyable music to hear, at least not in my small town.I bought this particular brand and model because I was worried about the space to my power outlet (Cigarette Lighter)in my '93 Ford Explorer. This seemed to be the smaller of the FM transmitters available. This is not the fault of the product, but I too am having trouble with my power connection so I would not recommend it for '93 and similar Ford Explorers. Power worked OK in my Ford F150 with a wide open power outlet in the dash.Very disappointed."
3,Not as bad as itrip but not perfect,I got great reception with this but it regularly loses contact with the power source. Twisting the thing around trying to get some juice while driving is a real drag.
2,BackStage Pass Review,"In my opinion if you are a fan of britney spears like myself then you already know all the information in the book and saw the pictures. This book is about her begining career. It is very outdated-it has all the brown hair britney's and is still talking about that Dawson's creek show that we now know will never happen. It talks about her hit song, and how she made it big. To me it was very weak, and was old. I would buy Britney Spears Heart to Heart or a different one that is more up to date with pictures, albulms, songs, appearences, and facts.To me this book was a waste and this is coming from a big fan. =0)"
5,Things I like about my IBM ThinkPad T20,"I love the ""trackpoint"" pointing device and, for a laptop, it's got the best arrangement of keys. I got a refurbished one years ago and it's worked perfectly ever since. It has all the things I need - USB port, Ethernet port, internal modem, DVD drive - and it's very light and sturdy. It even has a little keyboard light so you can use it in the dark - e.g. in a bedroom without disturbing someone else."
1,IBM not worth it,"I have several PCs. The IBM R51 I bought is the worst. The machine crashed several times within 30 days. Finally, it was determined because of a hardware problem (not something you expected from a new IBM laptop). After it was fixed, it keeps corrupting window XP OS. Calling support and service was no help, their standard anwser is to poush the restore button.IBM is not as it was before. Don't buy IBM!"
1,inferiority complex,"Minna Redmond has always been overshadowed by her beautiful french cousin, Gabrielle, even though they look similar. When she overhears a friend, Oliver Seymour, calling her plain and dowdy she is so enraged she decides to masqerade as Gabrielle and make him fall in love with her.I can suspend disbelief on the silly plot as long as the story is entertaining, but the whole story is weighted down by interfering relatives and the heroine's own feelings of inferiority. When the real Gabrielle --- could you doubt she would? --- shows up, although the author tries to show that Minna is slowly finding herself and standing up for herself, it all just seemed awkward and embarrassing and no fun."
4,This Hunter Has Been Captured...,"This is one of the latest entries in the Millennium Collection series and as such, should be considered as a very basic introduction to the artist/group featured. With this release, however, even the most ardent fans (such as myself) will want to own this one! Yes, it is little more than a ""greatest hits"" collection, but there are some great surprises: a rare stereo mix of the fantastic pot-boiling ""I'll Keep Holding On,"" an alternate mix of ""The Hunter Gets Captured By The Game,"" (with an added verse available previously only on the Anthology vinyl LP) and a slighty different mix of ""When You're Young And In Love."" The capper is a fantastic (and I do mean FANTASTIC) photo of the group featured on the back of the CD case. It's worth it to own this new release if only for this photo of these beautiful women. GRRRRRR! Thanks to these collections, many new fans will be added to the legions of already-present admirers."
4,The Best Of the Marvelettes,"After watching Unsung, I realized I did not have a lot of their hits in my music collection. This one covered most of the ones I knew and a few that I did not. I looked at other CDs and this was the most basic compilation of their music that covered from the beggining up to when Smokey Robinson wrote songs for them. If you just want their major hits and a few extras this is CD to get. It was also the one of the cheaper priced compliations."
3,"An alright book, but there are better","This book contains a fair amount of good technical information regarding landscape photography, but the photos don't compare with the stunning photos in other books and the information isn't presented in a particularly accessible manner. If you're looking for a landscape photography book, I would suggest there are better books out there than this one."
1,This can KILL your hedgehog!,"Hedgehogs can get unshelled sunflower seeds and the hard, dried pieces of nuts caught in their mouths or throats. They will choke, cut their mouths and tongues, and freak out and claw at their faces to try to stop their pain.I can't believe this company still sells this as a treat for hedgehogs. Hedgehogs cannot eat unshelled sunflower seeds any more than dogs or cats could. Raisins and sticky dried fruit can get stuck in their teeth.Look up info about ANY food you are thinking about giving your hedgehog. I wish I had-then my little hedgehog would not have DIED from trying to eat this inappropriate snack from 8-in-1."
1,Please do not buy,"As others have stated, this is a terrible product for a hedgehog. I have written to the company to let them know that this product is DANGEROUS. It sickens me to see this is still being marketed as a hedgehog food. DO NOT feed this to your hedgie."
1,Horrible,"Anyone even THINKING about buying this for their hedgehog does not deserve to own one. Get them some freeze dried crickets in the lizard aisle, and don't give them too many of those either (too much fat, but goodness do my hedgehogs LOVE them)."
1,Not good for a hedgie!,"This product is terrible for hedgehogs. This is yet another instance of where most of your pet food ""treats"" are horrible for you pets. (Similar to the yogurt bunny treats, AWFUL for bunnies.) Hedgehogs are not only not supposed to eat the majority of the things in this treat mix, it can cause them harm. I purchased this for my first hedgehog, unknowingly. LUCKILY she wouldn't touch the stuff! It wasn't until later that I learned how bad this could have been for her if she had eaten it. Please, please, please don't feed this to your hedgehog. If you want to give them a real treat try something they like that is good for them, like mealworms. You can get them freeze dried and hedgehogs love them. They are also close to a hedgehogs wild diet, (being insectivores) so won't cause the issues that the things like seeds in this treat mix will."
1,SHE Didn't touch it!!!!!!! Bad for Hedgehogs!!,"I had bought this as a treat ffor Princess Prickles and she didn't touch it! I tried laying a small piece in her mouth and she just spat it out. I left a small dish of this besides her food dish. I left it there for a week but nothing was gone. I wih I could send it back, but I'm sure it's too late."
3,NOT FOR BEGINNERS!,"If you do not have a couple of years of lessons and consistant playing logged, you probably wont be able to use this book fo quite awhile. While the content is certainly excellently plannned out, it infers you have some solid knowledge."
2,Not my color,"This review has nothing to do with the customer service, which was excellent, I just don't like the color. It's way too pink for me."
1,P.O.S,"This bow is suposed to be reconditioned, however the one I received had a bent steel bow, which could not be aligned. This made it impossible to shoot straight. Also the bolts advertized on the same page with it are too short for this crossbow. Do yourself a favor and buy a better one and save yourself the hassle of sending Steel Force back."
5,Horton Sleel Force cross bow,"I have had my Steel force cross bow about 6 years now and it still performs great. I can stick a broad head in anything apple sized every time at 40-50 yards. It also has amazing energy left at 50 yards with 250-300 grain 20"" arrows with broad head. Can't beat one for the money. I saw where some gentle pour mouthed one he got because it had a bent bow (its steel) he must not know Horton warrants it for life."
3,"Dee Lundgren Christian Counselor Langhorne, PA",This book is ok not much different from a whole host of self help books out there. It may sound trival but I hated the way the margins were set in the book with lots of white space on the left side. It annoyed me to read it that way even though it left room for notes. This is a book to pick up for some inspiration but nothing to write home about.
4,Good motivational book,Great information and motivation for someone searching for a meaningful career-specifically a high school/college age person. But appropriate for older adults.
2,Typical Self-Help,"I'm fairly young and just starting in my career really, so I feel I was not the intended audience for this book. It seemed geared more at people who have gone a certain distance in their life and feel that they are missing something.Admittedly, the topics covered did give me a chance to think about what I do want from my life, but it's all stuff that's been covered dozens of times before in various media. Nothing is really exceptional or noteworthy here, there's no innovative methods or intriguing solutions, just the usual fare about prioritizing and setting goals."
5,Motivational and Inspiring,"David McNally uses a number of quotes, anecdotes and exercises to create a sense of purpose for one's life. The book is a cross between a motivational business title like something from Zig Ziglar and a feeling-based inspirational book like something from Leo Buscaglia.McNally encourages individuals to set goals and work daily to achieve them and succeed at them.Readers will come away with a positive attitude that anything is possible."
5,MUST HAVE,"THIS IS AN ULTIMATE MUST HAVE TRANCE CD! THE TRANCE EXPERIENCE IS COMPLETE IN THIS CD, YOU HAVE DANCEABLE BEATS AND BEAUTIFUL VOCALS! THE BEST TRANCE CD YOU WILL EVER OWN, NO NEED TO SEARCH FOR A FAVORITE SONG, THEY ALL BECOME ONE!!!! I have had to buy this CD about 3 times cause I have given it away and gotten friends hooked on trance! EVEN MY TRANCE & HOUSE DJ'S LOVE IT!!!"
5,An excellent guide to using NT 4.0,"The NT 4.0 Administrator is a great, easy book to use to gain practical understanding of both NT Server and NT Workstation Operating Systems. It includes outstanding hands-on practical exercises in almost every aspect of administering NT 4.0. I taught the subject using this as my Textbook and the ability of the students to work with the software as they read proved invaluable to their gaining the necessary understanding of the subject."
5,very good strap,"very solid build and it wears comfortable, thanks alot , good stuff , im not sure why they make u write so much about some things on here but ok"
1,Waste of money,"It said it would fit a Sonata GLS 4 cyclinder, but my car takes a 1020 not a 1015, too late too return it, wasted $25 on a lie."
1,Low quality product,"This product is constructed of extremely brittle low-quality plastic .. it is advertised as ""shatter-resistant"", however, when closing the lid, the plastic latches basically ""fractured"" and 2 small pieces of plastic went flying towards me. Azlso, the main housing has cracked as well. I have not even used this yet and it's already broken. I am checking around if there is a similar product available which is made of better quality plastic, which is not so brittle and dangerous."
1,Almost completely fiction .,This very fictionalized movie really trashed Doris Duke . It was sad to see her victimized again .
2,Two stars for two stars...,"Of course, the performances are riveting. Just to be in the same room with these greats is a treat.However, this is a lifeless film, which might have been titled, ""Zombies In Love."" It went on and on andon, drab and exhausting to the final, gray, ending. Or, I should say, it ""expired,"" as did its leading lady. Two more empty-headed, befuddled, besotted (with each other and alcohol) bores could not befound on the planet. I think it was supposed to be a tragedy, but the true ""tragedy"" was watching it,because of one's fascination with these two brilliant actors (not the sad sacks they portrayed). Skip thismovie unless you are ""under the influence."""
1,SLOW TO STOP!,"THIS FILM HAS GOT TO BE ALL IN A CLASS BY ITSELF! THANK GOD THE SETS AND SOME OF THE MUSIC WERE PASSABLE. I KNOW SOME OF THE MUSICIANS THAT PLAYED ON THE SOUNDTRACK. AND I LIKED SUSAN SARANDAN . BUT SHE WAS REALLY GREAT IN ''ATLANTIC CITY. BUT THIS ONE WAS REALLY A DUD1.SORRY, BUT THAT'S MY HONEST OPINION...FRANK COLLETT TAGLIERI"
5,"Perfect Condition, Great Seller",The DVD was perfectly fine. Nothing wrong with the transaction. Easy and fast shipping. No problems at all. I recommend this seller.
5,Loved it!,"I loved it, it stuck with me. It's a great what if. The movie stuck to the facts as they are known. What is not known about the relationship of Doris and Benard is where this movie takes you. The actors are consummate in their respective roles.Dois Duke was a very private woman in her personal life, this leads to a lot of speculation. Most movie's or books on Miss Duke would have us believe that Bernard was at the very least a con man, at worst a murderer. Nothing was ever proven against him, the people who accused him all had an axe to grind. I found this movie a very refreshing change and extremely well done."
5,I fell in love with Bernard and Doris,"This beautifully shot and extremely well acted film captures an unlikely friendship at it's heart and eventual co-dependency. Susan Sarandon is her at her finest and creates a dreaming yet real, vulnerable yet strong and well rounded complex 'Doris' while Ralph Fiennes plays a convincingly complexly dysfunctional butler with nothing but love and adoration for Mrs. Duke. It's a charming and delightful tale of misfits who find each other and feed each other's insatiable need for love. Well done."
4,Bernard and Doris,"This was an excellent HBO film for TV with two great actors. I think it demestraigted how poeple (no matter how rich or poor) have certain basic needs; moreover how far we'll go for fulfullment of those needs. Thesetwo indiviuals came fom different back grounds, but I think they loved each other deeply. They went through many trials in their relationship.This film is Rated R for sexual content and language. I recommend it with 4 stars."
3,Average reference book,"The book has good sources and the introduction to each quote is both brief, yet gives excellent detail. The quotes are also span well over American history. Though the book would be better subtitled as the ""Words that moved the Author"" since they seem to reflect more of a narrow ideology, than a broad expanse of American culture. It is an excellent souce for minority or romantic quotes, yet completely lacks any military nor religious experience. When one sees two good Emerson quotes, but totally ignore the anti-slavery work of Finney, nor care of orphans of DL Moody, nor the quotes of living greats like Billy Graham; it seems that the work is too shaded to a personal belief rather than a cross section of American heritage."
5,I don't think G Rap is capable of a bad record,"As long as Kool G Rap can keep spitting out his grimey, storytelling rhymes, any CD he puts out gets 5 stars from me. The production on this CD is pretty good, but as with any album by this hip hop pioneer, the lyrics make the record a classic. If you like G Rap, this is a great album."
3,"Where's ""Keep Going""??!!??","For those that don't know, this album was made over two years ago on Rawkus Records, and bootleg copies have been spreading in that time period. That version was alright: not the best, but a lot better than his last two albums. But since G Rap moved to KOCH Records, this album has finally been released, and the album is only fair because they scrapped the best songs like ""First N (DJ Premier Remix)"" and especially ""Keep Going"", featuring Snoop Dogg and Devin the Dude, and produced by Hi-Tek. Those songs would make the album worth purchasing, but since they're not on there, just borrow this album from a friend. Also, contrary to what another reviewer said, Kool G Rap is capable of releasing a bad record; remember 4, 5, 6?"
5,hi,Be very careful this is not as advertised .this is not a collection of holmes movie by robert stephens .But is triple feature dvd set.the hound of the baskervilles starring peter cushing and andre morell. the private life of sherlock homes starring robert stephens and colin blakely. and without a clue starring michael caine and ben kingsley.all good in there own way but very different from a collection by robert stephens.
3,Not so good,I bought these knifes a year ago and almost most of them are chipping off. I have used them only on good boards and only hand wash them. When I call the company for warranty they want me to send them over and they may fix or replace them and may take up-to 6 weeks. They told me that this normal for these knifes becasue they are very thin and fragle. I am confused they say these knifes can cut through anything then the warranty department says nothing expect soft things. Beside that I never did use it on hard items anyway.
1,Disappointed,"Because this is a very old film, the audio quality is lousy. I returned the film as not acceptable. It should have been noted in the description that the audio was poor."
5,Roland the Minstrel Pig,"Roland the Minstrel Pig is an entertaining book by William Steig. The chartacters are witty and interesting, and the book is filled with surprising events. If you are a Steig fan, you are sure to enjoy it!"
1,Does not work,"As the other reviewer mentioned, it is very difficult to move the slicer back and forth. Just get a garlic press and be done with it."
3,Very Scratchy,I just watched Battle Cry and the beginning of the movie skipped a lot. The three stars is for the quality of the DVD not the movie. The movie get 4.5 stars. Not 5 as Leon Uris' screen adaption of the book changed too much and affected the outcomes. This wold be noted by anyone who has read the book.
1,Vital information missing to intelligently order these fan blade arms,"It is absolutely essential to know what the spacing of the attachment holes is at the motor hub. Without that bit of data, one is just shooting in the dark. There are several different spaceings depending on the manufacturer. It is rare to locate this vital bit of information from most mail order suppliers. My luck has been much better when ordering from stores that specialize in fan parts. The brackets are fine if you get lucky and get the proper spacing. It is NOT standard to all fans."
4,Groove On,"I re-visited this album from 2002 only to find magical nuggets ignored before. Nashville based Schfvilkus essentially dabbles in funk ....and then some more. And it's that `more' element that makes this outfit stand out. From the Meters-eque opener (complete with that nasty George Porter Jr. bass line) to dense noir grooves (Hoedown, Scuffle) from the straight and out Zen electronica on Much Minutes to the afrobeat of Sierra these guys deliver it all. This is not to say they are all over the place, far from it, with a firmly rooted quartet (guitar-bass-drums-sax) with decent compositions and even better musicianship, Schfvilkus extends it's sound by incorporating subtle electronics, violin (Tracy Silverman' bow cries on the hauntingly beautiful Hoedown) and turntables (DJ Viper). Sans a single vocal track with (fortunately the last one on the album), this is and all groove, instrumental affair that must be heard."
1,Left For Live: Deluxe,"Unfortunately, great performances are severely marred by terrible production (bad recording techniques, mixing and mastering) and the results are an unlistenable CD. Some examples of this are digital overload on ""Darker Side Of Night"", which could cause speaker damage to your stereo, drums that are recorded like ""drum sticks hitting a coke bottle"", cymbals that are mixed so loud that they crash through your ears, etc...If you want a great live John Entwistle CD, go for the King Biscuit!"
1,Not so powerful grill,"I received this grill as a replacement for some built in gas grills at my apartment complex. This gas grill took 45 minutes to cook a 1/4"" steak. There was no charring at all on the steak. Barely any grill marks. I cooked on it once and sent it back to the manager of the apartment. Not spending any money on this grill."
5,Emotional and breathtaking.,"Although far from suitable for minors, Elfen Lied is one of the most powerful and beautiful anime I've come across. Regardless of personal opinion towards the ending, anyone should admit that this anime is a masterpiece. I highly recommend it."
5,Elfen Lied entire series,"One of the over-all best anime I have ever seen. You would be doing yourself a big injustice if you denied yourself a chance to experience one of the finest drawn and complex stories ever. I truely give this series 5 stars. Believe me when it comes to anime, I am very picky"
5,Awesome!!!,"Beautifully created and compellingly interesting. I watched this anime about 7 years ago, and still it's a classic that is without a doubt in my top ten best animes of all time."
4,awesome,It might be slow to start but quckly picks up and leads you into a great story. Lots of action and gore so be prepared.
2,"Gore, violence and a terrible dub","One of the rare anime's that couldn't hold my attention for more than 3 or 4 episodes.The gore IS good, and imaginative in that Horror movie thrill seeking manner, which I found to be a rush in the first two episides, but like a cheap slasher, the cliche plot is just a hastily erected frame on which to hang the gory tidbits.If you like gore, suspense and political intrigue I suppose it's not completely merit-less but, for me, the good parts (i.e. gore) just couldn't overcome the flat English dub and otherwise boring plot to keep me watching. In fact, besides the gore, I couldn't find a single special aspect of the anime, other reviews not withstanding."
3,Not for advanced cake decorators,"Having never heard of the author, I took the risk of ordering this book with the hope of getting some new and clever ideas. Unfortunately, the book is filled with ideas and techniques I have seen in existing books. However, this book is perfect for new cake decorators."
3,Wish it would have Fit,These shoes are really cute except I ordered an 1/2 size larger than I would normally wear and they're so narrow I couldn't get my foot in themI ended up having to return them...
3,nice bag,"old bag wore out, came upon this and it seemed like a good deal. Had it for a few months now and it's performing well. Holds sticks, brushes, mallets just the way it's supposed to. Not sure regarding the zipper though. No problems, but it seems kind of ""light-duty"" for this application, hence only 3 stars."
2,It _is_ SuperFlat but that's about all,"I'd used Monster Cable's flat cabling to wire up my side surround speakers in my home theater setup, but decided to try a cheaper solution for my rear surrounds. Searching around on Amazon turned up this speaker ""wire"" that looked good and was priced right.Once I received it, however, I was disappointed. Unlike Monster Cable's flat wiring (which is stranded copper wire), this is basically two flattened-out slabs of copper. I'll bet it'd transmit an audio signal really well, but it makes wire termination with banana plug or pins almost impossible--let alone what I usually do, which is use the bare wire.It does include some kind of strange plastic terminator thing you're supposed to put onto each end of the wire, but there was no enclosed manual on how to do so, and Cables Unlimited's website wasn't much more help.This might work for some people or some uses, but not mine."
2,"OK, but no terminal bocks and screws came with package","The flat wire is as shown, but the packaging does not include the terminal bocks and screws like it says on the cover, will have to purchase seperately."
1,I received a different product that the one as shown on the picture,"I received a different product that the one as shown on the picture. The return process was not the problem, but I had to go through the hassle of contacting the Customer Service, packing it, going to the post office, etc ... It was time consuming."
5,GREAT GAME,"This game is a great stealth and shooting game. Do not listen to the idiots who say no one plays it online anymore, it is still the 3rd most played online game in the WORLD at least today which is June 13, 2005. If you don't believe me go to xbox.com and check. If you like shooting or stealth games this is a great one. The online play is awesome and the single player isn't about runnin around with guns blazing. Overall great game."
3,a tactical shooter minus tactical,"a brief review. graphics are outstanding. the reflection on water looks so real. characters look great. animation is great. a cool option available to switch between 1st or 3rd person. now, on to the not so good part. with only 1 squad, tactical advantage is lost. for hardcore original ghost recon fans, we remember using 2 teams to cover multiple objectives, well, not so anymore. this game has been designed for the new, casual gamer. the enemies are tough & numerous. i'm not taking that away. but the game is linear even with the very large maps. no more waypoints. only 4 orders are available. stealth is completely eliminated. no matter how hard you try, the enemy knows you're there. no more using the map to locate the enemy. very fast paced. similar to rainbow six 3. if that's your style, you'll probably like it. but hardcore ghost recon players like myself, will be a little disappointed with the very limited options in this sequel."
4,"An awesome game ,but where's is the strategy?!!!","Ghost Recon 2 is a fun game but the stategy perspective was elimnated!!! Hardcore Clancy fans were disapointed by the lack ofbattle field strategy. For people who love First Person Shooters or third like me proably see this as an new innovative first person shooter or third person shooter. You now have the option of playing in first or third person mode. There is also many other changes in the graphics engine and gameplay style. The new gameplay style is more so like Rainbow Six 3 than Ghost recon. I myself liked the change. The enviroments and maps were truly awesome. The multi- player and online play is awesome too!!!!!! In really liked lone wolf mode when you can do a mission with out a team and get high tech weaponary!!!!!!! The game is a little challenging but, in a good way!!! I strongly suggest you get this game!!!"
4,"Excellent game, but needs just a little work","I thought Ghost Recon 2 was a great game. The single player breifings felt like I was watching a History Channel special. The graphics, frame rate, and sound are all leaps and bounds above GR1. They even put in a feture to give your squad specific orders like suppression fire and flank left/right (and more important your squad AI actually has GOOD pathfinding abilities and aim) The Multiplayer modes are awesome. I mean, you can have 1-3 buddies help you through a mission, or pair off and go 2-on-2, or do a free-4-all.Unfortunately, you can no longer take over individual squad members in single player, or even change their gear for that matter. Also you only get one squad this time around, but with 4 people instead of 3."
3,Ghost Recon 2???????,"If you are a fan of the first two Ghost Recon games for Xbox, then expect to be dissapointed.Seems they have moved away from a tactical shooter to more of an arcade-like shooter.The squad voice overs are horrible and you are forced to either go it alone or fight with the same four squad members.Pick up Halo 2 instead....."
1,Major Glitch Causes Xbox to Crash,"Ghost Recon 2 is a blast on xbox live when it isn't crashing your Xbox. There is a major programming glitch that will cause your xbox to crash. This occurs in the middle of game play, or anytime for that matter. The game goes to a black screen with an error message saying, ""please restart your xbox."" This is happening on every copy purchased on every xbox using xbox live. Until the game can be patched and available for download, plan on being frusterated if your soul purpose is to play xbox live. The company behind this is obviously more interested in getting a pre-Christmas release for revenue then put out a descent an error free version."
5,wrong game sent,"When my son opened the case,Ghost Recon 2 wasn't inside it,but another game.I was disappointed,but he likes the other games so I guess is well that ends well"
3,could be better,ghost recon 2 has great graphics but its kind of boring and there are no health packs or ammo boxes. when you die the music is annoying. other than that its agood game
3,BEWARE... Ghost Recon Fans!,"Although the graphics in this game are excellent, the command system, and AI are complete failures. This is not the Ghost Recon we know and love. Your team mates are completely inept and essentially all they will do for you is fire blindly or charge into whatever ambush was meant for you. Multi-player mode holds some promise but overall this game is nothing compared to its earlier brothers."
3,Why no X/Y axis reversal???,"The game was made totally unplayable, for me, since I have a middle-aged mental block if I can't reverse the X/Y axis. Otherwise, the game looked good. Glad I rented it first though, would have been much more upset to find something so fundamental missing from this game and having spent $50. This game is not worth any amount of money without being able to reverse the axis."
2,Not worth it. This is not Ghost Recon,"I bought this game on the strength of the Original and Island Thunder. I want my money back. It's just doesn't meet muster. It cannot be compared to Ghost Recon.AI is lame, no control of fire teams or switching between team members. What is the deal with the Single character mission?I'll be trading this one in."
1,Ghost Recon-Not!,"This is not ghost recon, what I don't understand is why are all the great games going into teams of four? Ghost recon 1 was amazing and had 2-3 man teams but now you only have one four man team. In the original rainbow six games you had eight men (which was amazing) now you only have four? Is every military game trying to turn into Socom, i mean you can't make it much more obvious!"
2,My Review,It was fun to play ; but way to hard.You don't get enough health.Normal skill level in Ghost Recon 2 would be hard in any other game. I have seen worse games;but it could have been alot better.
4,SINGLE BRACED STAND,LIGHT & THE WAY TO GO!!! STURDY & DOES THE JOB!! USED DOUBLE BRACED STAND OVER THE YEARS & FINALLY SWITCHED TO GIBRALTAR!!
5,Great old Black and White western,"Rober Taylors second western. All the pieces are there for a great 80 odd minutes of good oldfashion type western. Indians charging .Horses falling all over the place. mantatorylone woman and small boy to be taken out of harms way> They dont make em like this anymore, mores the pity. Great Saturday morning film club type western."
2,I hoped the Indians would win,"Although I have promised myself that I do not buy cavalry versus Indian westerns I did it again. I blame those five stars given to this film. I am always at the side of the Indians which makes it difficult to find that the cavalry is on time again. The romantic triangles between the soldiers are not very interesting and took a lot of time. There was a lot of talk that did not get my interest. I do like Robert Taylor. He was the best thing in this film. At least in my DVD the night scenes were too dark. The locations were great and the final skirmishes were O.K., but when one is rooting for the Indians, one is going to be disappointed in the end. I can stand the Ford films, because they are so well made."
2,Little box of FAIL,"The laser itself is very weak (<1mW). The instructions for putting in the batteries are actually backward (though this may have been due to bad wiring in my particular unit). The 42 tips are more like 20 or so. They waste about 10 on nearly-identical snowflakes. A few are impossible to make out. Others are slightly defective, such as a reversed dollar sign. There are true duplicates, such as two skulls and two ""thumbs up"" tips. You need to press on the button very hard at the right angle to even get the blasted thing to function.However, these things are usually about $2 at flea markets. If you want a little red point of light in an absolutely dark room, this MIGHT do the job for you. At $2, it might be worth the risk. Just don't be surprised if this doesn't perform nearly as well as any other laser pointer you've seen."
2,"Great variety, but shoddy quality.","Cool variety of laser beam heads, if you can actually get them to work and stay on. Definitely not a pro product. Some repeats of designs, and some that you just can't tell what they are. In general I'd rather just buy 1 really good laser pointer than have 42 heads, and only half of them work (kinda)."
3,Okay,"If you like more acoustic/folky rock, you'll love this stuff. If you're looking for something a little more jazzy, you'll hate it. I just have one more thing to say...HARRY BAGDANAVOS (spelling?) DOESN'T GET ENOUGH CREDIT. He is a really great guy and a wonderful guitarist. He co-wrote several of the songs on the album, accompanied him on every one, was the only guy to go on tour with him, and his name is only mentioned ONCE on the entire CD case--in tiny lettering on the last page of the booklet under ""accompanist"" (again, spelling?). Come on, Dave. Give your #2 some credit."
3,Pretty good,"Wishbones is, musically, the best and most consistent of the three David Knopfler albums I own. These include Lips against the Steel and Small Mercies for reference.As usual, David sounds like watered down Dire Straits. But, hey, I love Dire Straits and I'll take it any way I can get it. And, as usual, the lyrics are a little weak.Overall, Wishbones is a pleasant listen. If you like David or Mark's previous efforts, I don't think you will be disappointed with this album."
1,Nice Sound from a Jerk,"If you ever check out David Knopfler's webpage, don't ever let him know that you're a fan of his big brother. I'll confess that DK's music DOES bear a striking resemblance to that of his older brother, Mark, the former Dire Straits guitar guru. I advise anyone to NOT ask for autographs from the man or anything else unless you intend on purchasing something from him. Aren't artists/celebrities supposed to be nice to fans? One would think so. DK is so bitterly jealous of his older brother's talent and success that he tends to turn people away from him."
1,Video quality is pathetic,"The quality of the video is pathetic. I find it hard to believe they are selling this. They aren't ready from prime time yet. Video quality was poor resolution, jumpy and sometime large pauses."
1,Listed as available for Prime Customers... but,"""Video currently unavailableDue to our licensing agreements this video is currently not available for purchase or rental.""---------------------------Every season of CSI that Amazon shows as being viewable online gives this same error, in four browsers and on multiple computers/laptops.Clearly, Amazon has some kinks to work out before making the entire main front page advertise for this (unavailable) service."
3,More explanations please...,"The premise of this book, a coverup of the landing of an alien spacecraft, has been used so often that for me, to read a 25 year old story, I expected something more original.There is no doubt that any government would try to act in about the same way than in the book if a saucer landed on Earth. What is interesting in this story is that civilization is threatened no by small green men but by the loss of electricity and technology. There is a glimpse of something more when some people succeed in getting into the spaceship, like increased mental abilities, but this subject is never broached again.I hope M. Tilley wanted to write a followup because the ending is quite unsatisfactory. What I believe will happen, is that people will eventually return to an earlier age when everyone was supposed to be telepathic. There is some mention of it in the book. Technology is not the savior of humanity? God forbid! :)"
1,toilet reading,"Oh my god this was one of the most dull books I have ever read. I must admit that it had a good chapter or two but I had to fight my way through..The start was so slow I really hoped that it would speed up but no such luck... This book ended up as a great toilet read as it was so easy to put it down..As for those of you who cant sleep at night or suffer form insomnia then get this you will be asleep befor you even finish the first page....... ""I give this a big boooooooooooooooo"""
3,a very nice read,"This is the story of Jackie,a thief who steals into the home of the ""giant"" Rory to steal his Faberge egg. She is caught however and ends up being chased down by Rory. Rory is a wealthy widower who has a wild six year old to raise. He decides that instead of calling the sheriff on Jackie he will make her his son's new governess. She at first balks at the idea but then agrees to it. She soon finds herself falling in love with Kevin, Rory's son, and also finds herself attracted to Rory. After a compromising meeting they get married and Jackie soon finds herself in love with her ""giant"". He too has fallen in love with her and evn though they are in love they must still conquer both of thier pasts to live happily ever after. I really enjoyed this story and will read more of Linda Jones's books in the future."
5,Nicely made bracelet,"This bracelet is very nicely built and looks very good comparing to the copper clad bracelet that i bought last year . It is light and weld built. It is also much lighter than the copper and stainless steel bracelets that i own. Does it help to relieve my joint pain? Absolute yes. Since i wear the copper bracelet and now this titanium bracelet, my pain have drastically reduced. I have stopped taking the pain medication for over 18 months now. I hope it will help others also."
4,Handsome Bracelet,"A good looking piece and it has magnets in every link. It was, however, too big. I had a jeweler remove 3 links to get it to fit properly. Does it improve my health? I don't know and I'm sure my doctor would say it is worthless. But I think it does something good, so I'll continue to wear it...except to the doctor's office."
3,"good, but Too much Happiness is better","this Italian band has matured, but this cd is below Too Much Happiness. It just doesnt have as much energy and raw power as TMH. If you like this band, check out Deftones, and get the first one instead. The best song is Moka."
4,It's a Levy's.,"Just buy it. Their products have single-handedly reinvigorated my faith in our neighbors to the north to the point that if this clown of a CIC of ours keeps up the same crap he's tossed at us for the past 24 months, I just might move up there."
4,An excellent collection of views.,"Although at times the essays in this do not always focus directly on Lincoln, in one he is compared to Bismark, they all reflect the greatness of the man and his post in the Amercan Civil War. This is a must have for those interested in political control of the military, nation building, and or Lincoln."
5,Deacon Frost Rules,"I loved both the book and the movie. I was really surprised at how the book captured the manic energy of the movie and the complexity of the characters. The book really delves into the deeper areas of the characters and captures the feeling that it's hard not to admire Frost while you're hating him, he's an awesome villain. Even if you haven't seen the movie, read the book, it's an absolute must for anyone who's a fan of Anne Rice or vampires in general, as well as anyone who wants to read a well-crafted piece of literature."
5,"Awesome book, you gotta read it!",Blade is the tightest book you'll ever want to read!!! The movie and the book are amazing. I've been watching the movie a hella-lot of times and you'll also like the book. Buffy v. Blade??? Blade all the way! cause he's the #1 slayer!
4,why is the book different than the movie?,I was just wondering if someone could tell me why the ending of the book is different than that of the movie......
5,"If you love African Animals, this is for you","Anything David Attenborough touches can be counted on to be perfection. This is no exception. The filming is excellent in this special. The cats are simply gorgeous, and you always learn a lot from Mr. Attenborough."
4,Breathtaking!,"My husband and I are huge fans of David Attenborough's nature documentaries and I've been collecting them over the years. This set focuses on some amazing creatures and stunning landscapes. There are eight episodes on two discs:Disc OnePolar Bear: Arctic WarriorCrocodile: Smiling PredatorLeopard: Agent of DarknessEagle: Master of the SkiesDisc TwoHumpback Whales: Giant of the OceansWolf: Legendary OutlawGreat Natural Wonders of the WorldGreatest Wildlife Show on EarthPure brilliance, and a must-have for any fan of Attenborough's and nature documentaries."
5,DVD Wildlife Specials Review,"Great DVD.Great fun to watch and learn about animals.Seeing many parts of the world.Can start and stop when I want.When I miss something, can replay to hear again or see again.To learn it is important to see and heard things to learn them.I enjoy watching over and over again."
4,"Very Good, But Bonus on Disk 2 ""Great Natural Wonders of the World"" ******","Very Good, But Bonus on Disk 2 ""Great Natural Wonders of the World"" is the best I have ever seen byDavid Attenborough and I have all his DVD's"
3,The Attenborough Hype 2.1,"After watching blue planet, planet earth, life of birds, life of mammals and life in the undergrowth...we of course had to purchase this title. By no means is it bad, but I would rank it behind all of the aforementioned titles. Does not have the ""wow"" moments the other films had. Worth $17-20 in this experts opinion."
1,Dershowitz,"Dershowitz is a Jewish nationalist, so it's not surprising that he supports the violently racist Jewish state, where a Palestinian born in Jerusalem but chased out by Zionist ethnic cleansing has no right to return, while a Jewish atheist who makes 'aliyah' from Milwaukee has full rights simply because he has a Jewish mother. This makes one think of Germany in the 1930's.Dershowitz is a disgrace to Harvard."
4,Very good ideas,"The ideas put forward in this book are a great contribution to thinking in the direction of peace. However, the practical is too dominant over the ideological so that even someone from either side who is interested in peace could fell wronged by the fact that his ideological basis has not been legitimized enough. Also the length of the book impedes a better integration of its theme."
4,"hopeful, but....","Eloquently argued thesis for why peace in the middle east is not only possible, but in the best interest of all the peoples who live there. Unfortunately, I feel that the premises are naive and the entire arguement fails when one considers that Hamas and the other rejectionist groups will never accept Israel's existence, no matter how much Israel is willing to compromise. That a huge number of Palestinians (majority?) agree with the ""terrorists'"" position and hate Jews and will never accept the concept of giving away any ""holy"" Arab land leaves hope for peace quite impotent. The book makes logical sense, but passions do not respond to logic, especially in the middle east."
1,A chance for Peace? Not Here!,"Dershowitz does not even mention UN RES 194(III) concerning the refugees right of return or compensation. Dershowitz would refuse compensation to the children of the original refugees - (It is the children , of course, who are alive now and who are protesting and blowing themselves up). He would put a 50 year statute of limitations (not 60 years!) on claim of refugees status-and he thinks that would be accepted! He thinks the right of return should not be a personal right of the origanal owner but a collective right so it could be negotiated away by Isreli politicians. He seems to say that the Palestinian refugees and Jewish refugees from Arab countries should both be denied compensation. The Jewish settlors should receive compensation! I wonder who he thinks he can convince of all this? Surely not the Palestinians. I suppose I could go on and on. Well - Good Luck, Alan."

5,this is nothing but holy ghost filled music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,to all christians:the lord has instructed this man of God to record some of the most amazing songs of all time. this is real anointed music. this is truly takingit back to how the slaves and our great grandparents praise the true and living God almighty.Praises be our lord and saviour Jesus Christ!!!!!!!!!!!i can't say enough about this tape/cd
5,I was probably an elephant in a past life...,"Yes, I really believe this. I'm a bit on the crazy side, and this DVD just brought it out even more. If you love elephants in the slightest, you'll love this DVD. You'll really see how intelligent, compassionate, fiercely loyal, and hilarious elephants are. I think that it's a great buy for all the episodes you get. It's really educational for kids, but still enjoyable. I showed it to my younger cousins and they were interested the whole time. The documentary is well-shot, well-narrated, and well-done overall."
4,Good if your in banking or financial management,"The book was over my head since I am not in banking or the financial industry. I actually was looking for a book on business risk management, oops wrong book.The first few chapters were relevant for a business person but after that I just didn't think it was worth continuing.Probably a 5 Star book, but I gave it four because of my mistake-Is that fair?????????"
3,"Good book, but formatting confusing on iPad Kindle app","The boxes and tables are not separated well from the text, leading to frequent jumping around to attempt to follow the flow. I hardly ever comment, but it's irritating enough that I couldn't help myself. Amazon, if you want my textbook business in the future, you'll have to do better."
3,Very good introduction to risk management,This book is very good at summarizing the basics of risk management theory and contains some quantitative methods. It lacks the in-depth analytics that practising risk managers will need.
3,Risk Management feeback,"It is a deep risk book base on financial area, but I hoped more operational guides, for instances mitigation strategies, list of project risk, groups of project risk."
1,DISAPPOINTED AND EMBARRASSED,"When I first opened the DVD a strong gasoline like odor came from the case. I didn't think much of it and put the disc into my machine. When I turned the lights back on my girlfriend had ink all over her face! She was really upset. I discovered that the ink rubbed off from the ""MY FIREPLACE"" DVD disc. Looks like it's a homemade DVD with cheap ink jet printing on the disc.As far as the fire it's okay, I wouldn't give it the glorious reviews that are listed here. I wish the fire didn't burn down, it would be nice if the main part of the fire lasted longer.I've had this DVD for a week and it still smells! Overall I was disappointed and wouldn't recommend this to anyone."
1,Defective Product - Twice,The first shipment arrived badly damaged due to faulty packagaing and the replacement shipment had a terminal error around 24min. After that I gave up - I'm thankful for Amazon's painless return process.
3,Replacement was required,I originally purchased one of these DVD'S last year and loved it so much I ordered another one for a second computer but it arrived unattached in the jewel case which damaged the DVD. A replacement was provided and it is working fine. Outside of this issue I love this DVD. I think it has one of the best fireplace shows around.
2,Disappointed,"I found this DVD underwhelming. I have watched about 1 1/2 hours of it so far. It never burns down; you can't see it looping, but it pretty much never changes except once, when the picture freezes about half way through. Doesn't really crackle loud enough. Snore."
2,Poor quality dvd,"While the fire is very nice, the DVD itself arrived with several scratches which caused the ""movie"" to pause, have ""boxes"" in it and ultimately stopped playing altogether. Nice fire, poor CD quality."
1,Stay Away,"I received this DVD...Twice. First one didn't work.Second one worked as long as I would ff the ""glitchy"" parts. Now it doesn't work at all, in any DVD player.Terrible manufacturing. Too bad, because the fire itself is nice."
2,Mine is also missing attachment,I wish I would have read the other review! I bought this item for the battery operated sprayer but it is not included.
2,Missing attachment,I am dissapointed to find out that it does not come with the attachment shown in the picture. The production picture is deceiving.
1,"This review is for Amazon, not the DVD","Why does Amazon put this on my recommendations...then when I click through to the item page I get this message:""Availability: THIS TITLE IS CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE.If you would like to purchase this title, we recommendthat you occasionally check this page to see if it hasbecome available.""What's the point? And thanks for wasting my time.Amazon does this a lot. And while I'm ranting, I also don't appreciate items with no descriptions or incomplete descriptions. It would seem to be that if nothing else there must be a summary of the item on the box that can be put on the item's page."
1,Buy Something Else... Please!,"This is a horribly written book, flawed by numerous instruction errors and miserable Quality Control and editing by the publisher. The premise and idea of this series is commendable, but as someone who teaches After Effects and Premiere, this was a sad experiment. I much prefer Adobe's Classroom in a Book, and I generally find much better third party titles than Adobe's. If possible, wait for more titles for the new version 6.5 to come out... authors will have had more time to catch up to the program than this particular volume."
4,works good,These work just as good as the over priced shaksperes . and the are cheaper would def buy them again if needed .
4,TRAM VHF antenna,"Recently I purchased the TRAM 1600 HC 38 inch antenna. I use this as a base station for an old vhf that serves as a weather radio on my camper trailer. This antenna works great for that. It a good value and I would not be afraid to use it on my boats. I did use a different mount as the one that came with it, is a touch flimsy."
3,should inprove,the new antenna should improve radio reception but i have not installed it yet its a direct replacement with a plastic coil instead of ss.
1,"Great antenna I think, except for packaging","The antenna came in a nice tube, and was shipped promptly. I took the antenna out of the shipping carton and was very happy with what it looked like, but I will never know how well it worked, becouse when I went to take it out of my dingy and transfer it onto my big boat at anchor the package that it was in opened and the bottom part fell into the water. So who knows hou it would have worked.Capt. BillTRAM 1600-HC 38 - Inch VHF Marine Antenna"
4,Very good!!!,"Great information about the breed. This is not just another ""one size fits all"" dog book with the same doggy content and different breed photo on the cover. Scotties have an unique personality and need understanding."
5,A different sort of Star Trek book,I was pleasantly surprised by this new Star Trek coffee table book which features a wide variety of art. The book is a celebration of the Federation after the Dominion War. It takes us in painting and in Friedmans excellent text to 18 stops from Starbase 11 to the Q-Continuum. There are short biographical sketches of each of the artists at the end of the book. I recommend this book to all fans of Star Trek. It left me wanting more.
3,"Good, but not what I thought.","I think a previous reviewers description of ""a great coffee table book"" about sums up how I felt about this book. Admittedly I may have expected too much but I thought it would have much more artwork pertaining to Star Trek Cultural landscapes (like on the cover) and more information on various races and planets. Instead the artwork is generally more abstract and it contains very little Star Trek (Fictional) Facts. I am admittedly a Star Trek technical hog. I do feel this book is very high quality and has a great presentation. Also the Vulcan section was great. Just not the kind of book I expected, if you are a prospective buyer make sure you know what kind of book it is."
5,"Abandon All Pretentiousness, Those Who Enter Here.","This collection is what comics sorely needs more of--higher profile thoughts of the medium's top creators speaking about the medium they work in.Ellis' collection, here, while sometimes unfocused, like his other writing, still gives fascinating insight into the world of comics itself. And the cover's beautiful. Go buy five. Now."
3,It's not a comic book,"First of all it's not a comic book! It's a book about comics. There you go, lost the half of you. Second of all it's a book about Warren Ellis ""talking"" about comics. And there goes the rest! So it's only you and me! But don't worry I got wiskhey! This is how the warning label in the intro. of Warren Ellis new book sounds like. The book is actuly a collection of writing he did for some website for comics and it dates from oct.1999 to dec 2000. In short it's ""the man"" talking about the industry, his collegues, and the future of comics. There are also some tips from ""the man"" how to get started in the buisness. If you are a big comic fan and would like to get some inside scoop of the wonderful world of comic, then this book is a intresting reading.P.S There are no pictures!!!! :)"
5,A Guilty Pleasure,"OK I'll admit I did my share of Barry bashing in my day, but when it comes to ""Copacabana"", this score just rocks! My favorite tracks include ""Dancin' Fool""-it's got such a driving beat to it! I also like ""Who Am I Kidding?""- one of the 2 funniest songs on the album, the other is ""Welcome to Havana"". If you like Barry's power ballads, then check out ""Who needs to Dream"". I know some people may think this score shouldn't be 5 stars the way a Sondheim or R&H should be, but sometimes ya just need to listen to something that never takes itself too seriously."
1,Unwatchable,"Bad, and not even funny bad. Watched 5 minutes with frequent fast-forward movement. Simply ridiculous. Bad script. Acting?? Worse than... (hard to find such bad acting to compare this to)."
1,SKYNETUP,"The cover and title have you so psyched out. No hot thing in this movie at all, and bad acting... The only thing thay snatched is the time spending watching it ( no star )"
3,hard to keep clean,"We normally use the cotton string hammocks which get rotten after a while and start falling apart. This striped hammock is nice and sturdy and works fine for comfort, but it ends up with all kinds of stuff on it from the trees and bird droppings because it is solid. We prefer the string hammocks because they stay cleaner."
1,Don't buy.. Worst Worst Vacuum cleaner,didn't last even 30 days.. it just spreads the dirt it gathers... can't even pick up small hair type of stuff..
1,Terrible Product! Once the belt is gone trash the whole machine.,"Seemed to work okay for the first use, but statred failing immediately thereafter. The pet brush attachment gets clogged within 30 seconds. One strand of human or pet hair and the roller stops. Forget about replacing the belt, it will just burn up as soon as you start the machine. I even cleaned and oiled the rotating brush and it still burns up brand new belts as soon as replaced. We tried time and again to fix the belt issue... five brand new Dirt Devil brand belts later and still unable to use. And, the filter is $20 to replace... total waste of money since I can't use the replacement at all because of the belt problem. Don't even bother wasting your time or money. If I could, I wouldn't even give this one star."
1,not worthed,"purchased the model 0887008 in late 2005, worked for a few moths than, it stoppped picking up the dirt, which was anoying, hard to slide around...buy another vaccum, which is why i am searching for a new one"
5,A Book For Every Lover of Dinosaurs and Adventure,"Jack Horner has written a wonderful book that every man, woman, and child who loves dinosaurs should read. I've been in the field with Jack for three years running and have often mentioned to him that I'd love to have a book that would tell me what the bones were that I found and more about the animals themselves - mainly so I wouldn't have to pester him with so many questions! I don't know whether it was because of my questions (or those of his other visitors in Montana) but he has satisfied my request in full. This is a grand book for amateur and seasoned dino-hunter alike. I eagerly look forward to carrying it with me next time in the field as I search for the elusive Big Sky dinosaurs. But even if I wasn't out looking for ancient raptor bones, I'd want this book, just for its fine writing and informative artwork. It's a treasure.Homer Hickam (author of October Sky, Sky of Stone, etc.)"
3,Every recipe uses the exact same base ingredients:(,"There is some interesting background info in the beginning, but once you get to the recipes, the base ingredients and ounces are identical. She just changes the additives and fragrance choices. (I could do that on my own). Every batch is the exact same number of ounces too--about 6 pounds (which is way too much for me as a new CP soaper).I don't want to give away the exact recipe, but each recipe follows this:xx ounces olive oilxx ounces coconut oilxx ounces Criscoxx ounces lyexx ounces rain, spring, or distilled waterThen she gives a variation on the EO/FO and additives.I was hoping for a wider variety of recipes for the oils."
3,My Favorite Sandy Maine Book,"Filled with luscious photos giving my first glimpse into the world of professional soapmaking. I was ready to graduate from beginning soapmaker when I first got this book. This was the first book that didn't patronize me with pictures of assorted kitchen utensils as soapmaking equipment.I have never made even one of Ms. Maine's recipes in this book, but I loved her ideas for scents and names. I found the courage to make my own recipes (with resources on the internet, mostly.)For the time of it's publication, it was a must have. For now, it could be a wish list book. The photos alone are worth the price, to me. It will never leave my library."
2,"Nice photos, but not great soap","The photos are wonderful. The recipes are only varied according to the eo's that are used. The amounts of eo's would not apply for pure eo's. Soapmakers beware! Start with a small amount of eo, find out how it effects your skin and those using your soap, you can always adjust.non tallow soap is too soft to make for everyday use. I use my soap for everything, including the laundry. I would not be able to do this with a vegetable soap. Tallow also cuts the cost, and last a lot longer."
3,Nice Little Book.,"Not tons of info and the recipes are pretty basic but if your just starting with soap making its a nice lil book and doesnt take up a ton of room. I would pair this with the book by Anne Watson called ""Smart Soapmaking"" and a good aromatherapy book to help figure out scenting and what goes well and what each oils properties are."
4,made 3 batches and they all turned out !,"Well , I wanted to make soap and I did it even though my husband finds me a bit domestically challenged in the kitchen ( that's my ploy and I'm sticking with it). Great book , easy and enjoyable to read but I was glad that I had spent some lab time in University I'll tell you...lye is nothing to fool with. Sandy makes soap making easy but she doesn't discuss the cost! Essential oils are expensive in my neck of the woods. I wish Sandy could have discussed infusions of herbs and if this was feasible to use as fragrance in soap making. My next batch of soap I will try using balsam needles that I pureed in my food processor and see how that works. Good intro to soap making but not for the impatient or faint of heart."
3,pleasing photos but there are better choices,"This little book is very attractive physically with photos that inspire. The information is fairly elementary though, even for the beginner, and could be easily found on the internet. For me, the main drawback is that the book really has only one recipe with the same proportions of the same three fats. The variations only differ in the essential or fragrance oils added to the mix. Try Susan Cavitch's Soapmaker's Companion if you want a comprehensive reference guide that is suitable for both beginning and more experienced soap makers."
3,Simple but Confusing,"Sandy Maine is a fairly good writer, her anecdotes are entertaining. Unfortunately her recipe refers to ounces with no clear indication of whether it is fluid or not and does not provide metric conversions for the more scientific at heart. The recipes are also quite large for anyone who just wants to try out the process. I recommend that people just download recipes off the web they are not expensive and often have more comprehensive instructions."
4,Every soapmaker should have this book in her library.,"I highly recommend this book as a good source for the person starting to build a library on soapmaking. It is especially helpful to beginners because of the easy instructions and recipes. Different soaps can be make by altering the oils and botanicals used in the basic recipe.I use it as a reference for soapmaking. I did not know anything about how to change recipes or make larger batches, and that was not what I was looking for. I was looking for a book with simple, easy to follow steps, good pictures and information on where to find products. I got that with Sandy Maine's book."
3,Real cute comedy,"When I rented this movie I hadn't even heard of it, after reading about it, it had a lot of familar actors so I couldn't resist. I thought it was so cute! I love about her being a pink lady saleswoman and Elvis impersonators seem to ""drop like flies"" whenever she's around. All in all it was a funny movie but with kind of a dark sense of humor but none the less enjoyable."
2,Fair to Midline,"Competent actors, decent cinematography, marginal story-line and ultimately a weak script. I watched about fifty percent of this movie and stopped as it left me bored."
3,"Sizzla is the consumate artiste, he does it all!","What can one say really. Sizzla is easily at the top of his game. Coming off the classic ""Da Real Thing"", Sizzla follows up with a disc with more polished production and sweeter melodies. From beginning to end the album is versatile and interesting. His depth as a perform is unequaled by any Jamaican artist on the scene. The man is just that damn good! Hardcore, roots reggae, and tons of tunes for the ladies, he does it all. Just be aware of the barage of old tunes though, its more compilation than album, but its still good. Good CD, Da REAL Thing is better though."
2,just not up to the standard I expect from sizzla,"Compared to the some of the amazing tracks and albums sizzla has done in the past this is really half-hearted and not thought-through, a cheap imitation of his better records and style thats been thrown together in a week. its just unispiring really. very dire. don't bother."
1,Sizzla should stick to what he knows best,look - what is going on here - sizzla you will be doing a song with britney spears next - stick to what you know best - your not main stream pop/rap - we want the jamaican ghetto youth vibe!!!
3,Not bad/not great,"Ive had the Airaid 200-919 on my 2005 Silverado 5.3L for 5 months/8,400 miles. Just removed it. The quality is first rate....the tube itself, connections/clamps and instructions all great. Fitment is excellent. Installed with OEM filter box with Wix paper filter. Noise from air entering throttle body increased dramatically from 1/2 throttle up. MPG same in town driving (I am a Realtor in PHX) but fell 1.5 - 2 MPG on highway. When towing uphill the transmission doesn't shift down like it did without the Airaid tube due to more air/power and the MPG didn't change. The reason I took it off is simply the MPG drop when not towing on road trips. If you tow and/or like the power/noise I recommend this item. I like the noise/power but the MPG decrease on road trips not towing is why I'm removing it."
3,Why anyone would club mix this song is a mystery.,"This song in it's original incarnation just plain rocks. Unfortunatuly, it's not club material, but this is not a bad thing, not everything should be clubbed. It's a party song for sure.Judging from the Jewels/Stone Remix and someone's review of the Pant's remix clocking in at 134, I get the feeling that this version would take away from the thrill of the original. The J/S remix was not as strong as the original.Not to say the remixers are not good. Hex Hector or Soul Solution could have done this song and checked in with the same result. This song is as good as it gets in original form. Now an 80's style remix where none of the original music is stripped away and the tempo is the same would have gone further in satisfying my remix cravings for this song."
1,Too little detail and guidance.,"Of the three books I have read on this subject, this one, by far, is the least useful. There is virtually NO technical guidance on how to hand color. Even the information on color selection is bland and uninformative. Rather than suggesting a couple of colors to use to give an item depth, the descriptions recommend single colors. This book treats the art of hand coloring like paint-by-numbering."
4,Excellent for digital photography too,"Although this book preceded the digital photography revolution--having been published around 2000, the book will give the digital photographer lots of good ideas, and more importantly learn where the styles of various photo software evolved from. By offering a more hands-on craft oriented perspective on hand-coloring photographs, lots of people getting into photography via digital may appreciate just how tactile and visceral photography can be--you may never use the processes described here but they might inspire you to sense the synasthesia that makes the body come alive when engaging in making art, just the way sculpture and painting do."
4,STORY GREAT! Battle engine took turn for worst,"Xenosaga II....okay we all said it, the battle engine blows now. Bosses are crazy hard. All I can say is get some dag-gone sword ethers to help and put aside some time to play. Get a walkthrough somewhere so you don't have to be so tortured. I really love the Xenosaga story line so I had to get this for my collection. Alot of voice acting changed. I actually like the up-beat music of the towns you walk through. I didn't bother to do the final side-quests after you beat the game--hey, I was studying for boards. Get it if you're a fan or you'll be REALLY lost in the third installment. The third one rocks and really makes up for number 2."
2,A big step down,"Long loading times at the start of every battle. A battle system that forces you to fight a certain way; a certain way that makes even the trivial random encounters take >5 minutes per battle. A short main story arc with dozens of annoying side quests that will have you spend more time walking from point A to point B (namely between 2nd miltia and the Kukai Foundation) than you will doing everything else in the entire game.The story even seems to lag a bit in the beggining, but luckily the second half of the game or so seems to pick up the pace. As The cutscenes and story are good, but seem lacking compared to the first one as well. Albedo can only laugh maniacally for 5 minutes straight a couple of times before it gets old.Did I enjoy playing the game? no. Do I recomend it? no. But,...since I plan on playing the 3rd episode as well (which is supposed to be much better) I trudged my way through it."
3,this simi ok?,this maybe a late review but it works ok but still freezes on cut scenes witch is annoying sadly .
2,Major Dissapoitment in the Xenosaga Trilogy,"first off i have played through the 1st and 3rd Xenosaga games but i never finished this one because it is bad and i will explain whypros:decent voice acting (except for Kos-Mos she just sounds weird)better story telling of the 3graphics are pretty coolcons:uninspired battle system of the 3, all i remember you did was just smash buttons and that was pretty much itterrible ES battle system, i was very dissapointed by this because i fell in love with the 3rd games ES battle system but this is very very shallow, all you do is button smash and why cant you have 3 ES's like in the 3rd instead of 2?fustrating puzzless after the 2nd puzzle i just gave upoh and i forgot to mentoin in one of the dungeons i was walking and there was this glitch i just wanted to point that outso overall i wouldnt recomend this game unless you are in it for the storyso this is my review and i hoped you liked it"
2,To tough for me,I bought this game because I thought it might be a good game to play. But I didn't get very far in playing it. I was really disappointed and felt that I had waisted my money. The game strategy is very complicated. I just couldn't understand and handle it.
4,Well Done,"I thought the first game was so-so; the 2nd much better. The combat is simpler to understand but more complicated to use - you start with all the fighting techniques you're going to get. Its up to you to figure out which characters and combinations of attacks work well in a given situation. Its a bit confusing until you get the hang of it. Bosses are a bit more complicated - you need to mix up the attacks of more than one character to be effective. There's always one major weakness to be uncovered.As far as the series - well, the story doesn't end here - if anything, it gets more complicated. Only a few loose ends are resolved, and several new ones are added.After the game ends, be sure to save - then continue using saved data. The game continues with a huge side quest that's not series related but has a story all its own.Over all - there's room for improvement, bt I'd say its better than FFX2."
3,The series killer?,"Pros:- Mechs are a bigger part of the games (you actually have to use them),- The graphics of the cutscreens are great, and the graphics overall are betterthan before,- A couple of the characters look better,- Much harder than Episode I,- More optional bosses,Cons:- New battle system is a load of mouse spunk (can I say spunk?),- Most characters look worse (especially Kos-Mos), and Jin travelsthroughout space with no pants on,- Almost all of the sidequests are terrible,- Very short,- The story is much weaker,- The dictionary is gone; and so are Shion's glasses,- No shops. Why are there no shops?- Too much more to list. Just bad. The movie ""Howard the Duck"" is better thanthis."
3,"good story, but no fun","this is a good movie. but it's bad game.the cutscenes are probably the best i've seen. the storyline far surpasses the first game.but GYAH, the gameplay is AWFUL! for the first 5 hours or so, the battle system seems worth playing around with. then you soon realize...there is no playing around with it. you do the SAME THING EVERY FIGHT. no new moves. you get new ethers, but you NEVER USE THEM unless they are healing ethers, and even then...the items are better. you can't buy upgrades (you don't even get money) which is NOT GOOD.if you finished the first one, you NEED this one...just for the story. if you can waddle your way through the awful gameplay, that is."
4,Very Disappointed,"I like this game very much except for some problems.:*)It's Very short, it could Probably be completed in 25 hrs..*)They gave the characters some face lifts which I hated because they looked better enough the last game.*)As for being a picky person I HATE some of the new voices for the old characters.*)KOS-MOS looks Horrible.*)Very Stupid Skills Systems.*)You can't buy weapons or items. You can only get them through battles, destroying objects, and treasure chests.*)Oh, and last but not least, the loading speeds. I for some reason didn't care about the saving speed."
4,If it was a CG movie.,"At fist , as most of u will be, i was disapointed from this game. but eventualy u will get attached to this game because of the story and the cinematics. In short, this game is better than Episode I in many things but worse in one of the most important things, that is the battles fun factor.-The game is GREAT in the story, visuals, depth, A.W.G.S fights, the new double attacks and many other things.-It is wosrt in the characters battles because their attacks became so lame, no special attacks for each character and their is no depth in the costumizing system, i mean there is no specific ethir skill for each character so u can costumize few to have every move and neglect the others.So i recomend this game to those who played the first episode. and those who are into the story more than the overall game play."
1,Absolutely Awful,"After sludging through this game, it's pretty easy to see why the 5 games announced were reduced to 3. Honestly, I can't believe that the series got the funding to wrap things up after this. This ""game"" just fails in every possible respect. From the clunky battle system, to the ridiculously over-thought skills tables, and even the so-called plot, the whole thing is a convoluted, nearly unplayable mess."
4,Its not great but its alright,"This game is alright for the most part, the battle system for the E.S.'s are awsome and they play a way better role in the game than the A.G.W.S.'s did in Episode 1, the battle system for the characters however can get aggravating at times. Expect to spend a few hours leveling up. I kind of liked the characters appearance better in in Episode 1 but the story line is just as good. Overall, its not the best RPG I ever played but if your into the Xenosaga story and side events its worth trying out."
3,WTF Xenosaga,"I would like to start off with the good things about the game. (which I still have not had the heart to beat). The story is very good. Very deep plot with epic twists and crazy characters. Graphic are amazing!!! New character models were unneeded but I'll take it. Music lacked a bit but not going to cry. Combat.....WTF XENOSAGA!Had to start a pharagraph for this one. This game is so fustration when you have 6-7 minutes fights that you cannot avoid. The whole ""stocking up"" before you can do damage is just not fun. Not to mention the endless one liners during the fight. MOMO's ""grant me a miracle"" had me wishing for a miracle. All things aside who play tested the games and said that the combat was ok? WOW! anyway I still have not completed the game and I plan on it just needed to get that off my chest."
1,not good,don't get this game when it comes out. you will be dissapointed since the cutscenes look boring. other than that avoid this came no questions do it.
4,Great CD,This is a very nice CD. Some of the songs are in Spanish and some are in English. I don't speak Spanish but I really enjoyed the music very much. I would recommend this CD to everyone.
2,kalimba is another Diego Torres lookalike,hey this is a cool cd but it isn't kinda a rock cd its a pop cd it has both english and spanish tracks and the music is cool but he will never be like a maron 5 hes not that type of music but its a good cd a pop cd
1,Poor Product Support,Not a very intuitive software and has a long learning curve which makes it tough to teach to warehouse staff. The company boasts about free tech support but in our case their only suggestion to our problems was to buy the newer version that they say dose not have the same issues. And if you ever upgrade to a new operating system like from XP to Win7 be ready to shell out more cash for a updated version of the software. No patches no updates No thanks.
1,Terrible,Nothing but problems--the item did not arrive in a timely fashion so I returned it. The customer service people were rude and not helpful. Beware
5,ONE OF THEIR BEST!!!,"ALONG WITH DECLARATION ONE OF MY TWO FAVORITE ALARM RECORDS FROM THE ORIGINAL LINEUP. CAN HEAR ENTIRE RECORD AND NOT SKIP A SONG. DON'T HAVE THIS REMASTERED VERSION, BUT WITH SO MANY EXTRA TRACKS I AM GOING TO PICK IT UP, I RECOMMEND YOU DO THE SAME."
1,Boring Film!,This movie was slow and boring. I am so upset I wasted my time watching this film. Worst film of the year for me so far!
3,Average,I'm not sure this movie deserved a 5 star review--this is of course being compared to other international films. Nothing too exciting about this movie... I think I can recommend movies worth 5 stars. But this one--not in the slightest.
2,Very unstable and poor quality,I got this valet stand for my husband and the first thing I noticed is the poor quality of the product. Once all the parts were assembled the stand would be very unstable. And worst of all the return process was long and complicated.
4,"Sturdy, sized right, a good purchase!","This product does the job! It's sized right, priced right, and sturdy. The only disapointment is the color. Thought it was going to be a dark brown as it appears to be (to me) in the picture. It is black. I know,'espresso' should have told me everything. I'm just happy not totrip over clothes hanging from the bed post anymore!"
2,ice carving made easy,"From a realistic point of view, the book doesn't help a whole lot. Unless you are a japanese master, you will struggle with the vague instructions. The pictures are very nice, but that's about it."
3,"nice pictures, vague descriptions","The author makes good use of templates and photographs, however the written instructions are very vague and not very helpful.(i.e. carve the head, shape the wing, etc.)"
1,DOES NOT LOOK LIKE PHOTO,I bought the more expensive one to keep for a few years too bad it came and looks exactly like the 20 dollar costumes. I wish I had more time to return and and buy another one but I didnt. It was cherry red and was suppose to be a deep crimson.
4,Good Quality Santa Suit,"The suit is well made and is as described. It has a very nice deep red color, thick fleece and lined jacket."
2,Disappointed,"I as disappointed withe suit, the sleeves were short, the jacket was not even on the bottom and I decided the lining was a cheap silky material that only made it worse, so I removed the lining. The pants were ok but their lining too as cheap and made the pants an uncomfortable fit."
3,Nice Product But Defective,"The product, or at least what I could use of it, was really good and went on easy. Unfortunately, out of the roll, only 2' was usable as there were roller marks or something in the rest that you could clearly see when applied....this obviously was not the seller's fault and I am sure they would have corrected this if I had contacted them, but it all worked out."
5,"No Colds, Flu since using!","This was recommended by a naturopath for my daughter who is caring for a chemo patient (her daughter) and doesn't want to get sick. While she has had one cold in this past cold/flu season, I suspect it is because she wasn't taking the supplements as regularly as she should. I have, and have not gotten sick. Very pleased with the results, and plan to continue using this supplement."
5,cure-all,"This formula literally cures the common cold -- when you feel the first symptoms of a cold coming on, take the prescribed dosage, and in a day or two, the cold is gone. I speak from personal experience on this. We keep a bottle in our house at all times."
4,as it should,"The item works as it should, I had no doubts since I was replacing my old one. Good turn around time on shipping too."
1,Comically Dull,"Let me begin by saying that I love documentaries and PBS usually puts out really great ones. Also I have a strong interest in this period of American History, but this one bored me to the bone. It gets off to a good start with vintage footage and then moves on to interviews from people who were there, but it misses the interesting feel of the time and doesn't seem to say anything that you couldn't just guess without knowing anything beyond that the market crashed. I thoroughly recommend that you skip this. I don't normally write bad reviews- I'll just keep my mouth shut if I don't have something nice to say, but when I saw that this had such good ratings, I felt obligated to bring it down a few notches. Watch it if you're having trouble falling asleep."
1,Bad disc,"I am deeply disappointed with this purchase. This disc would not play in my player,due to the fact that this is a copied disc.I think that i should be made aware of the details of a product before a purchase.I have been purchasing cd's on line and this is my first bad experience."
3,Great idea but...,"It's a great idea, but you can only use this in the bottom socket as the plugs are on the bottom and block the 2nd outlet if you use the top plug. I like being able to switch stuff off without unplugging!"
3,This is NOT the Islamic version of the story,"Although this may be a charming story for children, this is NOT the Islamic version of the story of the expulsion from Paradise. Please pay close attention; this is a fictional story written by a Muslim in the 9th century and NOT the authentic story that Muslims believe to be true as related in the Quran (Koran). Confusing this children's story with the true version would lead one to think Islam is a fantastical and implausable religion with elaborate, fairy tale stories. If you would like the true story as known by Muslims worldwide, I suggest you read the Holy Book of Islam, the Quran. In fact, Amazon sells several versions of its translation!"
1,Interesting Fairytale but definately not the real deal,The book is fun to read and the pictures are amazing. However this isn't the Quranic version of the Adam and Eve story. Both Adam and Eve are blamed by God and both are forgiven later on. Islam makes no mention of the pains of childbirth being a punishment for Eve.
3,Ok but not great,Our Guinea Pigs like the orange slices made by this company much more. They eat part of this treat but tend to get bored with it quickly.
1,Lack of Substance,This book is 61 short chapters (topics really) that discuss the various aspects of digital video without ever really telling you anything worthwhile. The authors go out of their way not to mention any specific products or have much an opinion that would guide the reader to any concrete conclusions.I can not recommend this book to a video enthusiast at any level of experience.
2,waste of 88 minutes,"this movie is so pointless. the soundtrack makes you feel like you are in a hitchcock movie but nothing is actually happening. there is not information given about any of the characters to make you give a crap one way or the other. it was just a waste of my time, 88 minutes of it."
4,Don't overthink it,"A beautifully CRAFTED film, in term of production value, camera work, editing, color correction, sound design, performance...etc. a filmmaker using his tools to try and capture random unexpected moments in each of his protagonist's lives that resonate with great gravitas for each of them... you have a feeling that each character will be forever changed from an interaction they never could of expected. Quiet, small, intricate... entertaining and moving for those that take it in for exactly what it is - a simple study in the complications of human nature being conveyed through the fabric of film."
3,Take it or leave it.,I enjoy looking at shows from the past and this was once a theatrical release. It is very different from The Green Hornet of the 1960s in which Kato has more outstanding role. The Black Beauty in the later version is equipped with more gadgets. I guess for the 40s this a modern movie of that time.
5,A Very Short Introduction book as it should be written,"The task of creating a concise, well-rounded, and very readable introduction to life and teachings of Carl Jung seemed impossible to me until I read this book. This book is a true work of love written by someone intimately familiar with the subject. This is not surprising, considering that Anthony Stevens is a practicing psychiatrist and Jungian analyst who wrote several good books on the subject as he has been developing ideas of Carl Jung in the last thirty-plus years.If you need an excellent short introduction to Jungian thought, look no further."
4,VERY GOOD INDEED,"One cannot cover everything authoratatively in this series, but I think that the main goal is to stimulate further reading and interest in Jung and his works. This book succeeds.Having read a lot of Jung in my early 20s I thought that it would be merely a review read, a sort of re-primer of my existing knowledge, which was, I must admit, clouded with a notion that Jung was little more than an interesting anti-rationalist, or -- at worst --- a dedicated metaphysician.I was wonderfully reminded that even as Jung taps into things that are commonly regarded a perhaps a little flaky by those students of modern science, he always seems to raise a question of central relevance to humanity. It is these questions and his never ending quest to probe them --- not solve them --- that reminded me of why I was interested in this man in the first place.A stimulating read."
4,Perfect for the non-initiated,"I know very little about this field and my interest is just curiosity, so this book fits my purposes perfectly."
3,Not very tasty ?,"I bought this for my mature,slightly chubby Tiger Oscar(Tigger).She wont touch em'.Perhaps shes spoiled.If your fish is the least bit finiky,you might wanna pass on this.For all I know,""Oscar Show"" is great stuff.But it dosent really matter,if they wont eat it.I guess im gonna stick with ""Hikari"" Cichlid Gold.Just less of it."
3,"Be careful...ignore my ""star"" rating","Like one of the previous reviewers said, Dr. Deffrey Satinover does have some pretty weird things to say when it comes to homosexuality...I don't know how much his views effect his thoughts on the bible and its authenticity but read his thoughts and decide for yourself...spend your money wisely. Here is his homepage http://satinover.com/main.htmHe is a member of PATH (Positive Alternatives to Homosexuality) and NARTH (National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality)"
3,A Controversal Book ?,"Well, regarding the reviews on the German version of this book, I have to say I am glad I got it for 3,95 DEM. It is not easy for me to decide whether there are any mistakes concerning translation and/or historic background for I am not an expert in Hebrew language or history."
4,Intriguing and Thought-Provoking,"I picked up this book as a Bible study, a simple scholasticexercise. But the stories of the rabbis and other Jews who lived,breathed and sometimes died over their Torah has gripped my heart. This book goes into such things as Rabbi Weismandel, whose deal to bribe Nazis for the lives of Jews went bad, and he ended up tearfully bidding his wife and children goodbye as he jumped the train on its way to Auschwitz and they went on to certain death. It was he who brought the code to modern-day light, where military cryptographers and mathematicians trying to break German war codes became interested and eventually applied it to the first computer for cracking. More than announcing, ""Here is the amazing code,"" this book brings to life the amazing people behind the discovery."
4,Things that really matter,"Cracking the Bible Code was a non-stop read, simply because of the issues that keep on demanding one's attention. The subject is very sensitive and immensely important for the scientific community as well as the religious one, but I think the author is handling it very well. Unfortunately, the book does not have a haskamah (endorsement) from a rabbi. There is no doubt that what dr. Satinover is saying is consistent with traditional Jewish thought, but many readers (especially orthodox Jews) consider it important to have it formalized. The conclusions the author gets at should make an impression on those who are honest with themselves, and inspire them as the book inspired me."
3,Criticism of the book,"The book in question is interesting, but, unfortunately, some factual errors in it make one become cautious. For example, on page 237 it states that Max Planck developed his theory in 1912 when he was 19 years old. Not true. Max Karl Ernst Planck was born on April 23, 1858. He developed his theory in 1900, when he was 42. Then, as one of the proofs that the Bible codes are real, Dr. Satinover indicates that no such phenomenon had been found in any other book. Not true. ELS similar to those reported in the reviewed book have been found in many other texts as well, both in Hebrew and in English. For example, in a contemprary novel by Dahn Ben-Amotz titled Ziunim Ze Lo Hakol, published in 1979 in Hebrew in Israel by Metziut publishers I located a number of ""encoded"" ELS, one of them containing the following ""encoded"" words: Amir Will Kill Prime Minister Hero Rabin (page 33 in Ben-Amotz's book)."
4,does the word of God contain the entire future in the first five books of the old testiment.,Cracking the Bible code is a fairly gripping fact based book however if you are really interested in finding out how to research this on your own your going to need a computer.
4,Changed my life.,"I used to wander the world scruffy, and bearded. I didn't like shaving, it didn't like me. Then I got this kit, and now I shave everyday. Clean shaven, and suave.I absolutely loved this kit with the upgraded brush ($150) from the Art of Shaving. Keep in mind the most important part of a great shave is the brush and the cream, they are the heart and soul of shaving. I can't comment on the cheaper brush, but the shaving cream and aftershave last an eternity and are great. I eventually moved onto the Art of Shaving soap, but I never would have realized how much I could like shaving without this kit as an introduction."
5,Great Shave,"Excellent products! I would highly recommend this travel set. Using these products, as instructed, has eliminated razor burn and provides the closest shave possible."
1,Like Shaving with Gritty Mud on Your Face,"Save your money! I tried this product after being sold into by a very talented saleswoman in the retail store. I tried it for three days, hoping for a cumulative effect but after the third day the razor burn was soo intense I have to discontinue use of the product and darn near seek medical attention to cool the about 6 hour razor burn I had. I normally shave first with an electric razor and then follow up with a mach3 DRY and that is less abrasive on the face than using this product. The brush that comes with the kit is seriously cheap quality and looks horrendous after the first use. On the third use I had strands of badger hair all over my face. This is not the sign of a brush thats worth while. I was thinking when I bought the product that if it was total crap I could at least use the brush - well, as it turns out I do not think I will get much life from the brush. Do yourself a favor and get a product that isn't overcharging for hype."
2,Not what I expected from this company,"Even though a set looked exactly like on a picture bare in mind that the box is about the size of a paperback, and it weighs about the same. All the bottles are realy tiny, they look like a one time use products, the once you receive for free with your purchase, and the brush quality is not what I expected from this company. If you are looking for a present you will feel rather embarassed to give it."
5,Thes best shave of my life!,Sure it takes a little longer in the morning to do but the results are amazing. The smoothest shave I have ever had. Leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized in addition to smelling great (I use the sandlewood but the citrus is great as well)
4,Spalding 88369 In-Ground Basketball System with 60-Inch Acrylic Backboard,"Found a great price on Amazon, a lot of goal for the money. The 3 piece pole was very hard to put together as the collar/sleeves didnt come together very easily. It took a full day to assemble and stand up but it is a very nice, solid stable goal. Some clearance deals at sporting good chains my be a better deal but I think I got the best value in this price range."
1,How about listing this album in a rap section?!,"This album is weak. How Biohazard have started out, and then how they ended up here is impossible to comprehend. From the angry hardcore in their first albums, their latest creations have become a sort of rap songs collection, really pathetic and weak. In fact, Limp Bizkit (as much as I hate them) probably is heavier than nowaday's Biohazard."
1,NOT WELL MADE AND SLOW SHIPPING,"YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. I WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THE CRAFTSMANSHIP OF THIS UMBRELLA. IT WOULD NOT DO WELL IN A WINDY AREA, SAY NEAR A BEACH. THEY ALSO SENT THE WRONG COLOR AND IT TOOK 2 WEEKS TO GET IT. THE BASE WAS NOT SHIPPED EITHER. I CONTACTED CUSTOMER SERVICE ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND THEY STILL HAVE NOT CORRECTED IT."
1,Listen to the first reviwer!!!!,"The first reviewer is absolutely correct. The blurb on the back of the book sounded so interesting. Amanda is one of the most pathetic young woman that it has ever been my misfortune to read about. I was ready to throw this book against the wall. Please, save your money. If I could give this book negative stars,I would."
3,4Port USB,"Somethings work with it and others won't. You have to just keep trying different things to find out what does or dosen't. Fine for what I needed but am not entirely pleased. I expected everything to work, wrong. It is hit and miss in my book."
1,As shallow as a teaspoon,"Not once do they say the words ""Watch Batteries"". These are scammers using generic dribble but marketing it to any niche they can think of. They really want to use this to sell you more of their kindergarden marketing vommit. At $2 I was ripped off."
2,A disappointing collection.,"Judging by some of the authors who contributed tales to this anthology, you'd expect something of very high caliber. Sadly, most of the stories are fairly run-of-the-mill, and I barely remember them just a few days after finishing the book. Even Caitlin Kiernan's beautifully written short is a bit predictable. It's nice to have Harlan Ellison's vicious ""Bleeding Stones"" back in print, but otherwise this is one theme anthology that is more or less missable."
5,Best of Niel Young,For Niel Young fans - this is a must - when all the great songs were new - and now here perfectly re-mastered.
5,Neil Young at the height of his powers,"This album illustrates like no other Neil Young at one of his peaks of artisic explosions. The high melodies of such songs as ""Old Man"" soar easily. Imagine being there when he was 25 years old and writing songs faster than he could record them. This album is like a time machine and the next best thing to having bought a ticket to see the Massey Hall performance."
4,Awesome Neil young set,The only reason I did not give this cd and dvd set 5 stars is that some of the video on the dvd is only of a tape player playing the song. It's amazing to see how Neil played these songs and to listen to his banter and retuning to drop d or double drop d between songs.
3,Great music. Not so great footage.,"The music is excellent. I love Young in this period of his career. The footage is pretty weak, though. A lot of the time it's just footage of an empty stage with musical props."
5,I love Neil's music and lyrics and the dvd is sooo cool,"I Love this music on this cd/dvd. It's great to hear Neil play guitar and sing solo, on stage, so raw and so heartfelt. His music is so beautiful and it's so cool to view the dvd and the special features. Way cool dvd and music."
4,"Poor quality video, excellent audio","I bought the CD/DVD combination, because I was interested in seeing the concert. Unfortunately, the video quality is spotty and for some of the songs there is no video at all, just a view of some instruments.The audio quality is fine, and Neil sounds so young! It's a joy to listen to...Enjoy."
5,Neil Young cuts across generations,"Earlier reviewers have accurately captured the essence of this 5-star masterpiece. What a recovery after the disappointing 3-star Live at Fillmore which though nr 2 launched the performance series. John, one of the earlier reviewers, wondered how the next generation takes these songs. Well, I can not write for the whole generation but about two of its members, my two sons. They love Neil Young's music. I have a lot of music which they won't touch and they have music I just don't understand, but we are perfect agreement about Neil Young - he cuts across generations. A 8-CD 2 DVD first archives release, 1963-1972, coming up later this year. Can't match this career highlight but should be interesting. God bless Neil Young."
4,Young with the voice you can't forget...,"Neil Young is one of the best song writers in the past half century (stricly my opinion). This CD/DVD is a great experience of a concert before his voice had as many miles on it as it does now. Strong, clear, hitting every note! That the quips between every song can become somewhat annoying, they are pure Neil. The DVD suffers from some hokey montages of Massey Hall, and other topics, where as I would rather have had it just stay on Neil during his singing. Still, buy it! It was in this concert where he first sung his classics from the Harvest Album. This is an important CD if you are a fan, and if you are just a casual listener, you won't be disappointed with the man's voice."
5,Brilliant album,"As a live album, I couldnt ask for any thing more. From the notes neil hits in Old Man.......to the suite of A man needs a maid/heart of gold... a fantastic album.... It made me go and buy the other album in the performance series, live at the fillmore east.I like the DVD quality as well, and on a good system it sounds fantastic.. However if you only want to listen in your car, just get the cd version...Reminds me in someways of the other mellow Neil Young Album Unplugged."
5,Add this disc to your collection,"The disc is outstanding, marvelous live album, the sound is wonderful, the concert is an intimate setting. The whole disc puts a smile on my face while I listen. A must have in any collection."
5,Intimate...almost too intimate performance,"This CD/DVD captures Neil Young during a very creative time. He had just written most of the songs performed with Journey Through the Past probably only a few days old. Bad fog of loneliness, which he had never released, is a real gem.Get it..."
5,Neil Young: A reflection of our Time,"I graduated in 1971, a time of great changes and a time of what I would term, the greatest period of musical creativity in human history. I believe Neil Young is a big part of that history. The music of Neil Young and his counterparts such as CSN is a pure reflection of the mood and creativity of this period in time. I am proud to be of this generation and the wonderful music it has given the world to enjoy.Without the great music of this era, life would be much boring and without the joy of reflecting back to our memories of our own life experiences. This CD\DVD is like a cornerstone of the foundation of that music. A perfect reflection of our generation and it's music. Thank you, Neil Young."
5,Live At Massey Hall,"CD/DVD really good loved watching Neil perform been a fan since After The Goldrush was released in the late 60's Neil never puts out a bad album all good, Thanks Neil if you ever read this."
5,Brings me back to college dorm rooms late at night.....,"...in the mid to late 70's....listening to Neil on offical and unofficial recordings. Specifically, the BBC broadcast tape and the intimacy and personal nature of the songs and performance. This music is woven into the fabric of my formative years. These performances are imprinted on me, just as the Carnegie Hall performances, Royal Festival Hall shows, etc. were so many years ago. Many thanks Neil ! I look forward to the the Archives release in September."
2,"Timely, but thin on content","This book is very timely given the growth of IM in the workplace. However, I found that it is very wordy, with minimal content. Could have been condensed into a short article. On the other hand, if you are new to IM or security, the book will be a good introduction."
1,A most depressing book,"I am Catholic and have started to do Devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus. I thought this book would be a great boost to my practice. I have never in my life read such a depressingand violent book. If this woman were alive today she would be in a Psychiatric ward for her own safety. The self imposed torture she created for herself made me want to cry. I do not think Jesus Christ would ever condone this type self-debasing in his name. I believe in a Jesus of loving kindness and compassion. You certainly do not have to beat, starve, and drink fowl water to get his attention or to cleanse yourself of impurities. The book will go on the shelf never to be read again. I can see why some people leave the Christian faith if books like this come to their attention"
5,lets be honest,"I have used this book for devotions before and after mass. I have read it at home and have never put it down disappointed. The wording in the book can be a bit flowery at times (like a lot of French writing was back then) but it still has page after page of challenging questions and will teach you alot about loving Christ. for what its worth, my faith and love for Christ have grown after applying what I read in this book."
4,Very thorough,"After being blessed to obtain a relic of St. Margaret Mary, the Apostle of the Sacred Heart, I purchased this book to help learn more about the devotion and its particular practices. It is very easy to read, very thorough, and has increased my devotion to Jesus and my connection to my new friend in Heaven, St. Margaret Mary. I highly recommend it."
2,OK book,Not so easy reading. Had good prayers in the back of the book. This is for a nun or priest or daily Mass goer.
4,"Short, but informative","The book is short compared to the ones published in the same area of research, but it is quite informative and easy to follow. One can find most of the important concepts about polymer physics, but sometimes a secondary resource could be needed. Overall, it is worth the price."
5,Guest hits right chord,"Paul Guest is a wonderful surprise. Emerging from the rural/suburban South, he paints in the most simple terms and references to the icons of the region the complex picture that actually exists.He is the poet laureate of the Wal-Mart South. Exposure to pain and suffering are part and parcel of the total experience here, and yet most find a way to move on. Much is said in the well-chosen few words that this poet crafts into vivid imagery. I eagerly await his next work."
3,average,"I bought this amp on Dec 2010 with $300 and listened a few months. The sound is pure as advertized, but to me too weak, I mean, not dynamic. I set aside this amp replacing with Sansui Au 717.Now I am satisfied."
2,"Bad Saddle, Bad Bad Saddle!","I purchased this saddle to replace a 5 year old saddle on my Giant OCR Touring bike. I have ridden many miles in the last 25 years including long distance tours. This saddle is the most uncomfortable saddle I have ever used. I tried several adjustment including; saddle position on rail. angle of saddle, height of seatpost, and handlebar height and angle. I was unable to find a combination that would work. The only way I felt that I was on the saddle (not sliding off) had the seatpost height so low that my legs were cramping from not being able to extend. Otherwise, I had to carry a significant part of my weight on my wrists, arms, and feet. I did give this 2 stars for I thought that someone who wants a seat for a city cruiser bike to ride around town may find the saddle satisfactory. I have already returned this torture device for a full refund."
2,not a solution,"This corrects my previous (more positive) review. I tried a moonsaddle before, had to return it. This one seemed much more comfortable at first. But as I continued to use it, it felt progressively less comfortable: too hard, too small. Still better than the moonsaddle, but no solution for aches and numbness caused by the conventional saddles."
2,valky,"Short story here. It's still a bicycle seat. To hard. You'll have to get off, and walk in 4, or 5 miles. The Hobson is much better for the tail bone."
1,worst book i ever read,"Stay away from this book. It may be the worst book Iread. It is a bunch of cliches held together with overwrought writing. At first, I thought it was a satire, a take-off of hard-boiled badly written books. I got about halfway through this book, hoping it would get to the point, and then realized that it was to be taken seriously. Don't."
1,American Anthem,"The cover leads you to believe you are buying a Denyce Graves CD. Don't believe it. She only sings in 3 songs. The rest of the CD is an amalgamation of old, worn out recordings (e.g., Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops). If you want to appreciate the real Denyce Graves....pass up this CD and head to the Opera section."
2,Pure gold nugget,"Despite the above objections, I find the recording of American Anthem by Denyce Graves, included here, to be just too beautiful to pass up this CD. For me, to have this one song alone to enjoy is worth the price."
4,Great little fairy book!,"This book measures 5""x6"" and has 29 poems. It may not be the best poetry out there (thus 4 stars) but they are all very cute and make me happy! Some titles: Wand Practice (very cute), Bluebell Time (like this one), The Brownie Poem, What Do Fairies Do?. The illustrations are for the most part smaller in size and scattered around the pages (almost every page). They are done in brown silhouette and they are delicate and beautiful! I am so happy to add this to my collection of fairy books!"
3,Winnie the pooh lamp,"I really like the lamp from winnie the pooh.the only neagativ thing what i dont like is the volume you can have it only on or off, and the melodie is really loud when it is on.so latelly we have the ton off."
1,This isn't anything like Dramamine..do not buy,I ordered this for my mom and she said it didn't do anything like Dramamine. So you get more tablets of lesser to zero nausea stopping power.
4,Nice easy listening,"Very pleasant easy listening. I'm always looking for music that makes my hair stand on end, and there was none of that on this album, but I will play this over and over, especially in my car."
4,Hints for getting along with others when you're different,"This book is written for the bright child himself, to help him figure out how to appreciate his own abilities while recognizing that ""brighter than"" does not mean ""better than.""How do you, a bright kid, deal with kids who like you because you are smart and funny, yet don't like you for the same reasons? Why do the kids you talk to and play with act in such conflicting ways? What can you do to build friendships? (""Don't be a show-off."" ""Don't try to make everything go your way -- be willing to compromise."" ""Be patient with people who don't see things in the same way you do."" ""Be kind, caring, honest, trustworthy and a good listener."")In many ways, this is the book I should have read when I was growing up! I must have been a pretty obnoxious kid/adult until I figured out all these things for myself."
3,Not for Homeschoolers,"I bought this book for my homeschooled 8-year-old, and was disappointed to discover that almost the entire book talked about how to handle school. GT classes, working with teachers to negotiate more suitable learning opportunities, how to survive on the playground and in regular classrooms -- all these topics were addressed, but none were relevant to my homeschooled son, who still has questions about how and why he thinks and perceives the world differently than other children."
5,Brilliant!,"My 7-year old son has known he was different from other children for years. He knew his mind worked differently, that he was interested in different things and that he didn't really relate to kids his age. Shortly after he took the WISC and he was ""identified"" as a ""gifted"" child my husband and I pre-read this book. We determined that it was not only appropriate but necessary for our child to read it, too. He read it in one sitting and we watched as his demeanor changed chapter by chapter. He was excited! He FINALLY found something he related to, something that made it all make sense to him. After he was done reading he stood straighter and his confidence multiplied. It wasn't important that he was ""gifted""; it was important that he wasn't alone. At 8-years old, he now takes fierce pride in who he is and he now knows that his differences are a blessing to him."
5,Great Resource,"As a counseor who works with gifted kids, I love using this book with my clients and their parents. Very helpful and written from the kiddos' perspective."
4,Haven't read yet,This was also a recommendation by a friend but she said it an excellent read n I take her at her word for she lays give me the best!
4,Excellent Explanations,"I took calculus over 40 years ago and have found this book great for regaining an understanding of the subject. The book is very good because it is clearly written and interesting. Just one gripe. Although mathematics is an exact science, the author implies that one can numerically prove a limit, in the case where both the numerator and denominator approach 0 (Lesson 5.1). Fortunately, I was patient ; because about 130 pages later, she covers L'Hospital's Rule (Lesson 12-2). She should have mentioned that the numerical solution was a stopgap and that she would cover the exact solution in Lesson 12-2."
5,one of the best tarot books,"This is one of the best tarot books I have ever read. It covers a lot! It get into almost everything about love, romance and sex that you would want the tarot to tell you. It has added a huge chunk of information to my knowledge base and has greatly expanded the information I can cover in my readings."
2,The dog got lucky...,This jerky is overly dry and cut our mouths when we attempted to eat it. We soaked it and the dog was very happy.
4,Blues connections,"For this celebration of earthy acoustic music, scholar and bluesman extraordinaire Corey Harris trekked to Mississippi and Mali, West Africa, to make a series of modern field recordings. Stateside, Harris cut resonator slide tracks with fife-and-drum musicians; in Mali, his bandmates included the great Ali Farka Toure on guitar. The resulting performances -- a mix of traditional blues and African melodies, songs by Skip James and Blind Willie Johnson, and originals by Harris and Toure -- are as spontaneous and relaxed as a back porch pickin' session. Through his music, Harris reminds us of the rhythmic, melodic, and spiritual connection between traditional African sounds and early American blues. If you're bummed by the slick production values of contemporary blues guitar albums, the dry, present tones and relentless funk of these tracks will set you right."
1,Great songs spoilt by production,"I heard a few of these songs from other sources, live, in lessons and I heard this great singers voice on dub side of the moon. So much promise but after 2 minutes I wish I hadn't wasted the money.For some of us, the overly loud and brash castanet like percussion that ruins half the songs will be the worst problem. It's out of time too... And for a musician like myself it's completely unlistenable. Not just that but on some other tracks the drums are clearly overdubbed, and poorly. I find myself unusually angry, at Corey for letting this happen to his work and then fleecing me for the cost. Nevertheless I will be buying his other CDs, I advise pre-listening first to anyone looking to buy it!"
2,Stuck in traffic.,"As a 15 year resident of Boston, I was hoping for an engaging, objective read on urban dynamics/dysfunctions but got rather more of a shrill diatribe. One page would contain thoughtful musings and compelling statistics (although just about any statistic can be manipulated to support a given viewpoint) followed by a page of politically correctisms (the one laugh-out-loud moment is when Suarez actually claims he is not PC!) Too many good questions are raised to easily dismiss what is presented here but its angry, insulting tone and over-emphasis on racism almost cancels this out and you are left with a near-wash."
1,A college student perspective,"I started to read this book for a community service class. As I read I got more and more angry at the book. I understand that I don't really know what ""city"" is disappering as I came from a incrediably small town in Iowa. However, is it really all that bad that the old neighborhood city is disappearing? Maybe we all just need more room to breath! I also found this book incrediably racist. I'm sorry, I have ""black"" friends and ""hispanic"" friends living near me in Iowa and I don't even see their skin color. People, realize that we are living in the new age and that racist feelings are not really harbored in the small towns compaired to larger cities. The people who moved out did it for other reasons..I'm not saying that some didn't, I'm saying most did. And the author never ever says anything about those people moving back to the cities. If he wants to present an argument fully he has to see both sides. And he never did."
5,Great for small children,"We use this for a daycare bag with my toddler. It is pretty small, but definitely works for smaller children."
3,pretty good,this radar gun is pretty good. It is easy to work and use. The only problem with it is that it is very ocward to hold and sometimes it doesnt read speeds right. I used it to rad the speed of hockey pucks and it did pretty well considering that they are small. It works great for cars but it cant read much over 135mph. This is a nice gun but if you want the best gun this is not it.
4,As advertised,"This radar gun works fine for me. I didn't have the problems others have reported. The trigger does have a sweet spot as reported in another review, but it is a minor problem. The gun has a baseball mode, but I use it for measuring the speed of cars. It works whether the car is coming toward you or away form you. I also tried it from my vehicle and read the speed difference between me and cars passing as well as the combined speed of mine and those approaching. You can easily figure the real speed by additon or subtraction. I was surprised to find it will read my speed just by pointing straight out the windshield. I don't know how, but it does. I guess it reads stationary objects up ahead, although there were no signs or bridges nearby. It claims to read car speed at 1300 ft, so maybe it was locked on a structure far off. The smaller the object, the closer it has to be. I locked onto a 14 mph dog at about 200 feet."
3,Easily Broken,"This is my second Bushnell Speedster radar gun. I am having to replace the first one because the cheeply made plastic trigger broke on the inside of the gun. If Bushnell would have taken the time to design a sturdy trigger system, this would be an excellent product. Easy to use, tracks pitch counts for many pitchers. Just very disappointed with the low quality of this unit's construction"
3,Speedster is pretty good.,"Im the pitching coach for a super league team and I bought the speedster to trak our pitchers. it works quite well, there are times it does not register the speed but for the most part it works really well. This is a good item especially for the price."
1,Makes good paper weight,"Product did not operate as advertised. Very difficult to get any speed reading from any direction or distance from pitcher to catcher. Was able to get speeds of passing cars, but worked poorly for baseball pitching."
1,Went bad in a few months,"I bought this gun to measure my son's pitching speed. The first few months we had it, it worked OK (not great) where it measured the speed reliably about 6 or 7 times out of 10. But then, it started registering the speed less and less often. It got to the point where I could only get a reading 1 in 20. I sent it back to Bushnell for repair. They sent it back to me saying that nothing was wrong. It still continues to only register about 1 in 20. Obviously, this is a piece of junk."
1,Total waste of Money.,Why has my past review been removed.I thought you guys where fair and im-partial.Anyway based on the number of other negative feedbacks looks like you cant hide the truth for long.THe triger breaks. The Battrey compartment breaks without even touching it. The strap breaks the minute you use it.Acuracy is poor. And gets worse with age.Customer support is non existant. Not even an e-mail address on the site.My honest feedback. If you need a toy buy it. If your serious. Buy something else. Ever wonder why a products price keeps droping. No sales. [...]
1,Does not work for baseball. Very frustrating.,When it was new out of the box it worked for baseball about 50% of the time if I was within a few feet of the pitcher or catcher. It seemed to become less effective each time I used it to the point that now I'm lucky to get a reading 10% of the time. It still works for clocking cars but for baseball it is almost useless.
1,Not worth the buying,"This book is a collection of illustrations taken from various unnamed late medieval, renaissance and post renaissance sources. In Ms. Jablonski's forward she does not name her sources for her text or for her illustrations. It is next to useless for doing anything with designing gardens based on what is presented in the text or the illustrations."
2,Christmas Lights,They were pretty when they worked. They seemed to have a bad connection and only worked part of the time.
3,Not yet tried,"I ordered these solar lights for my niece's live Christmas tree to be used at their family cemetary. She passed away August'06. Her mom put battery powered lights on the tree this past Christmas. She knew, of course, the lights wouldn't burn long.It gave her comfort anyway. So I started browsing the enternet and found the solar lights and sent them to her. When my niece's headstone is delivered,in the spring,her mom plans to put the solar lights on the tree then.That is the reason for the 3. It's middle of the road. Her mom was very appreciative of the gift. I hope they do the trick."
3,Stunning Italian,"The violin playing is spectacular and rivetingly idiomatic. However, Italians all too often present their music in buildings of great architectural interest which give too much reverberation to the sound, and that is the problem here. It is not an insuperable problem, though it may make you speculate on Italian aesthetic priorities. It's a wonderful recording after you accommodate to all that intrusive distant space between this demonic violinist and wherever you are actually seated."
5,Maggie!,"In the liner notes it states that this may be the most mature work of Lionel Bart, which was to be the end of his wildly successful string of hit musicals. The dual theme of prostitution and labor revolt is brought to life in the Liverpool setting. ""The Liver Bird"" has those interesting chromatic harmonies so resonant of the 60's. ""Dey Don't Do Dat Today"" is another example of how witty and clever Bart could be while the rousing title number doesn't stop until it wins you over. ""It's Yourself"" could have been sung by Judy Garland, it's certainly that type of heart wrenching ballad. All of Bart's musicals get five stars, not just Oliver!"
3,Not Bart's best,"I do love Lionel Bart -- not only Oliver! but also Blitz! which I wish someone would revive. Maggie May is a bit more experimental that the other two, and a bit less melodic. Doesn't quite work for me, but well worth a listen, if you like Bart."
1,Not up to par!,"I was rather disappointed in STONE HEART after reading two other Luanne Rice books. It did not have the same appeal as Cloud Nine or Follow The Stars Home. The plot was a little disjointed, and the main character's relationship with another character a bit unbelievable. It had too much unesential description and detail and was very hard to get through. I skipped a lot 3/4 of the way through but read the last three chapters just to see how it ended. It was definetly not up to L.R.'s par!"
3,"Okay, but not earth shattering","I have used these a few times and find them adequate if not stellar. They are small and they do sort of release a lot of powder when you first pull one out of the tub. The tub isn't super functional, but they do work reasonably well. They are no match for doing the job ""right"" with polish and whatnot, but are good in a pinch. I will likely keep some of these around for those morning rush jobs."
2,You will NOT receive the container showed in the photo,"The wipes are like sand-paper, but for jewelry, keeping the proportions of course. I mean, these are very small wipes (2,5 x 2,5 aprox.) rougher than regular tissues paper..... that's all. I suppose it can work if you want to do a light clean in your jewelry. But I truly dislike when the companies send you a different product than the specified. In this case, you are NOT going to receive a container where you can remove the papers as tissues. You are just going to receive a small Connoisseurs container where you have to open it and remove each paper one by one. For me this is not a problem, but just to let you know my experience."
2,Small Polishing Clothes,"Polishing Cloth - Silver (11"" x 14"")The cloths are small, work only so-so and are a little difficult to manage. The most useful thing about these cloths is that you can pull them up like Tissues. However, you can't pull them up too high because you have to still shut the lid in order to keep the unused cloths from drying out. This balancing act was somewhat difficult. The cloths are on the small side and work only so-so in cleaning silver. Unless you have only small items to polish, I would not recommend these."
3,Woops I meant to buy the liquid solution,"I tried to surprise my wife with how thoughtful I am and replace her old jewelry cleaning solution (she loved it, it worked great - same brand as this one - we didn't bring it w/ us when we moved). Anyway I bought this by mistake, not worth it to return.. we haven't really found a use for it yet, so it's just sitting in our cabinet taking up space."
3,"Nah, not that good","Got this off a reviewer of anti-tarnish strips. She said that she polishes her jewelry with these wipes, then snugs them away with the strips. Well...using these wipes sounded easy but it is not easier than any other decent silver/metal polish. I had to rub with my fingers til they hurt and were black and powdery yucky...and we're not talking heavy tarnish.I have several other polishers, some of which contain anti-tarnish in them. I was looking for something easier and maybe less messy than liquid polishers. But this is certainly not easier, and not better, so I prefer to polish with the ones which contain anti-tarnish.I also use the anti-tarnish strips too, especially for small pieces, but they have to be replaced periodically.Probably would not buy again"
4,Excellent Product!,"I bought this product with the desire to remove tarnish from a sterling silver bracelet that I hadn't worn in years. The bracelet was heavily tarnished and had small detail areas. With the wipes I rubbed the bracelet everywhere there was tarnish, and in some places it took longer but all of the tarnish came off! It was amazing. These wipes are dry but they do an excellent job without any mess. I did get some residue on my fingers but I washed it right off. I would definitely buy this product again it is so quick and easy and definitely adds a nice shine to your jewelry."
2,Keep Looking,Not as good as I would have liked. I can see the tarnish on the cloth but the jewelry did show much difference. I rather keep looking arounduntil I find something better. Sorry.
2,"Great for dust and dirt, doesn't work on actual tarnish","These dry wipes are, on the positive, safe and easy to use. But if you have real silver, you need to know that they don't touch the black tarnish that mars real silver. They're great for dust and dirt and brighten the cheaper jewelry, but I still haven't found a better way to clean silver than the old fashioned, messy, toxic way."
3,dry wipes,"A friend recommended this product. i was looking for an easier way to clean sterling than the jeweler's cloth i had been using. i don't see where this product was any better than the cloth, and it's disposable. i'll stick with my cloth."
1,Not for young children,"My husband loves it, but it wouldn't be appropriate for young children due to language mostly."
3,Sold Seperate,"This was the Spider-Man cartoon that came on MTV, not the hit one that was from Fox Kids.Its kind of a waste of money. You can these episodes along with the 13 episodes that were released earlier. But if you only liked some of the episodes, then you might like to have this one."
1,Awkwardly not for kids.,"It would be nice if this was labeled that it is intended for adults. I was dissapointed that I could not watch this with my kids. The swearing seems out of place...almost as if it was forced. The animation is dated, but I think still good for a T.V. show."
1,spiderman high boltage villains,I found the DVD to be completey inappropriate for children. Too much violance and too much swearing. My kids watched 5 minutes of it and its now in the garbage.
2,Quote Book,"This book is a compliation of quotes that express Quaker ideas. The author lists these quotes, by topic, in separate chapters. There is no unifying prose within this book. I was disappointed because I was expecting the kind of book you can sit back and read. This is JUST and bunch of quotations. If I had wanted a reference book to pull quotations from I'd bought a 'book of quotations."
4,"Good, enjoyable, but dated","Johnson and Brown mapped out the AI field of the 90's pretty well with this fun, readable, accurate book. Not heavy on math but still pulling no punches with its descriptions of neural circuits, _Cognizers_ is an optimistic look at the then-emerging field which is just now revolutionizing the way we use machines to solve problems. Well worth a read even at this late date."
3,Its time for a new edition,"This book was written in 1979. The text and photographs were excellent, although the range maps were so small as to be useless, and the common names were the awkwardly academic types used in the first half of the last century. Supposedly, this book was updated in 1997. The text is still good, as are the photographs, but the common names still have not been corrected, the range maps are still too small, and over 70 new species that are now recognized from North America are missing from this book. This Audubon Guide is out-dated. Time to write a new one, with standard common names, modern taxonomy (drop the subspecies), and maybe some new photographs. Not recommended. Get the Peterson Guide. It may be a decade old, but its newer than this book."
4,Good For Wilderness Getaways,"Though I agree with others a revision is long overdue, and there have been a few new species discovered over the years; namely salamanders. I still find it quite helpful though, in identifying the lizard that just ran across the trail, or for that possible snake sighting. And as bad as my eyes are (Keratoconus), yes the maps could be larger, but I don't find them particularly hard to read. Except for certain species that have very small and restricted ranges. Then finding the little dot can be near impossible. Beautiful photographs. Gives one a better appreciation of these animals; that, along with years of watching the ""Crocodile Hunter"" God rest his soul."
3,time for an informational update,"As with all the Audubon field guides, the strong enduring points are the quality of the photos; the durable binding and leatherette cover; and the index that is organized and cross-referenced to the photos.The descriptions are pretty staight forward; but, the summaries are woefully inadequate, even when this book was current. The anatomy, life cycle, and habitats are discussed for each species, albeit vaguely.In the eventuality that there is an update . . . the details need to be fleshed out more; the range and distribution maps made more concise; and the descriptions of new species discovered plus expanded summations of each species would correct the deficiencies.This field guide still has its place in the naturalists library, if only for the quality of the photos. For better information, however, you may want to look at the Peterson's guide.Extracts: A Field Guide for IconoclastsThe Cloud Reckoner"
2,Simplistic,"This book is great if you have young children. The pictures are cute, and the text is simplistic and large. It is not for someone looking to learn a great deal about the breed."
4,Not a lecture/movie of the week-- suspense!,"The premise of this book-- a high school girl begins to suspect her best friend of psychological problems after finding a defaced photograph, and then the friend is accused of somehow causing the death of three infants-- drew me in. I expected it to work itself out to be a treatise on how dangerous repressed emotions are, or possibly even schizophrenia.but this book does not condescend to its teenage readers that way. Lauren refuses to believe in Janaan's guilt and as events play out they become more difficult to explain away-- especially when the coffins turn out empty.The two girls end up doing some detective work of their own and uncover the surprising truth. This is somewhere between Judy Blume and Nancy Drew and I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would-- I was prepared to find a predictable conclusion enjoyable enough but this was so much better. Highly recommended and an unexpected treat!"
5,Absolutely the BEST!,"I loved PVD before, but after getting this CD set, I feel I'm honestly obsessed with him. This is his BEST album, in my opinion. It IS very different from his usual stuff... I actually wish he'd put out more albums like this one. Definitely worth the money!"
2,There is Irony With The Album's Title,"I bought this album the week it was released. I should have went with my initial reaction of awe regarding the sheer number of tracks that were on each disc (always a bad sign that your in for anthem mania), but a was still a novice electronica shopper then!It still obviously sold enough copies to please the powers to be as there is a second album under the same title. Always a market for everything.Two discs full of tacky athems and re-mixes that I still have not figured out how anyone could actually dance to. Then again, I did visit a club in Vienna, Austria...let's just say the occupants' dancing styles were...unique.Both Disc get 2/5 stars."
1,Disappointment,Seeing Paul van Dyke over the years and knowing about his capabilities this mix CD is very disappointing. It's a listing of a bunch of tracks without heart and soul. Too bad.
3,ah-so what,"I don't OWN this cd but ive listened to it quite enought to know that it isn't as great (for me) as everyone else. If it even says dancing, then the cd should be more upbeat. Average. I like pvd's new stuff...check out Vandit Sessions 03 instead!"
4,This album was really something...,"AWESOME! This is exactly the way you would feel if you listen to the Politics of Dancing. Theres more than one reason for this. Firstly, its definitely one of PVD's best compilation. Then, if you compare P.O.D with the other so-called 'trance' compilations then you would realize why PVD is the best Dj in the world. The way he's selected the tracks is truly fabulous. Its got amazing intros, good build-ups, awesome breaks, sampled with a lot of breakbeats and an ambient feel to it. Its got the smooth flow and the mixes are flawless - they just blend in! If you 're having a monotonous, dull day - POD is the solution - it just gets you going! A Must Buy!!!"
2,The Politics of NOT Dancing,"In one interview I read from ""Ministry of Sound"" about making ""The Politics of Dancing"", PVD said, ""We are getting lazy"". I don't know what to say. I'm a big fan of PVD and I believe he's one excellent example of what make real trance music.He selected popular dance tracks to mix in this album. It still had that soft quality and like usual vocals were minimal, but something seem to be missing here (To name a few mixers, check out Tiesto, Ferry Corsten, and Alex Gold strong mixes then you would know what I mean.). The dreaminess suddenly vanished on the dance floor. I did not want to dance at all. I got kind of tired of the music and it's rare that I do. It did not feel the same as his original work where it takes you to another new dimension. If I were to play the cd, I won't even recognize it was by PVD."
4,Only 4 Stars but 10 Star Song on CD1 Song 7,I like Van Dyk but love song 7 on CD 1. that song is worth the price of the whole cd. it's just one of those songs that reminds you why you love techno.
5,One of the tightest mixes around!,"This mix CD is one of the most thoughtfully put together and best sounding mixes I have ever heard. Van Dyk obviously went far beyond playing 20 records in a row and really tore apart his DAT tracks to make these CDs.If there is any fault to be found on this mix, it's that the last track on the first CD doesn't seem to fit. It seems as though he slapped this track on as an afterthought. Still this CD is an absolute must have."
5,This is what you're looking for...,"No studio album comes close to duplicating the effects of a recorded live set. The sound, the crowd, the vibe, it's all there. With this double CD, Paul Van Dyk comes as close as anyone ever has to bringing those elusive tracks only heard live to a CD player. The mixing and track selection is simply perfect. It's Euro progressive trance. It separates the likes of Van Dyk from the rest of the pack. It's a work of art."
4,No politicking...,"Van Dyk doing a compilation? I must say that I was extremely curious. Not that I thought it wouldn't be up to par, I was just so used to listening to his past production masterpieces. How do you follow up an album as good as Out There and Back?But Van Dyk never ceases to amaze me. The Politics of Dancing combines great get-off-your-ass dance tracks with smooth, laid-back trance beats. Whatever mood you're in, its aight.His sorcery with the beats and his seamless transitions tend to separate him from the rest of the trance pack in my mind. You can't stop this guy, you can only hope to contain him."
5,The best PVD album yet,"This is pure work of art. PVD has done it again, and he is in the top 3 dj's in my book. Can't get enough of his creations. Keep up the good work, if you ever get to read this."
1,How did this get published? Yuk,it is full of typos and other errors! Page 44 whether or not a candidate MEATS your. . .
3,Has some really useful interviewing tips,This book helps you to come up with good interview questions to identify outstanding people. I've never thought about asking some of those questions in interviews. I normally focus more on the technical aspects than the soft skills/behavior aspects. This book is a good eye opener. I was able to correlate the behavior of the outstanding people described in this book with the ones in my organization. Most of the behavioral aspects match.There is nothing unique about the rewarding techniques proposed in this book. Most of them are well known and widely adopted.
2,Do not wash!,"I loved this hamper for about 9 months, until it finally needed a wash. I followed the manufacturer's washing instructions on the label and even let it hang to dry so it wouldn't shrink. When I went to put it back on the wooden frame, I discovered that it had shrunk about 4-6 inches. I've tried re-wetting it and letting it dry on the frame while gradually trying to stretch it back to it's original size, but even that didn't work."
4,Hamper - Sage Chambray,"I also love the bag inside of the hamper so you can just grab the clothes and take them to the washer. Unfortunately, the hamper that was purchased for me had a warped bar at the bottom and does not sit flat when opened all the way. I should have taken it back. If it weren't for that, I would love everything about the hamper."
3,Beware of Shrinkage,"The review by Janine Flood took the words right out of my mouth! I washed this in cold also. I don't remember now, but I may have even air dried it. If I did dry it, it was on low heat. It shrank so much, I can only get the velcro to reach around the wood frame on one side a tiny bit with much effort. It's enough to hold it on though. I've managed to use it for 7 months so far and I do like it alot. The mesh bag is great. I keep the cloth top flipped open unless I have company. It would be a pain to have a seperate cover to open each time or leave lying around."
5,This hamper is great!,"We love this hamper! It is so nice looking and works well. I keep it in the closet, but it would also look just great out in the room as well if you don't have the closet space. I really like the size - it holds just enough clothes to do one large, or two medium size loads. The removeable mesh bag inside makes it so easy to tote to the laundry room. I'm thinking of getting a couple for me and my husband in our walk-in closet - either one for each of us, or one for darks, one for lights!"
3,good but shrinks,"this is a nice hamper, but it does shrink if you follow directions. you should only wash in cold water and don't put it in the dryer. the company is great, though. if you contact them, they will send you new fabric free if it shrinks.."
2,Don't Wash!,Hamper serves it purpose but don't wash it otherwise you'll have to buy another! I thought I better wash since it is a cloth material and I'm putting dirty clothes in it. I followed the washing directions and it shrunk so bad that I can't get the velcro ends to each other. Have the manufacturers followed their own washing instructions???
3,it shrinks in the wash!,"The hamper works great, but don't make the mistake of putting it in the dryer. It shrinks and no longer will fit on the frame!"
4,Good Hamper,"I received this hamper as a gift from my baby shower and I absolutley love it. The only problem is the inner mesh liner has ripped at the seams. I have contacted Kids Line and they were happy to replace the liner. Great product, Great Company!"
4,Nice hamper,I love this hamper for my daughter's room. It has a separate mesh lining that comes out and makes it easy to carry her clothes to the laundry room. It is sturdy and good sized.
4,Just choose a color,It is a great product. It arrived sooner than I thought it would and all I had to do was take it out the box and unfold it. It was a paler green than I had hoped for but I can get over that it still goes perfectly with the nursery. So all you have to do is choose a color.
4,Great Hamper but destroyed after one wash,"The hamper is terrific in that I never had a problem with the wood frame (other reviewers had) and the design is well thought out; having the mesh liner is a good idea. Unfortunately, my hamper cover could not make it through the first wash. I used cold water and delicate cycle and still the fabric ripped during the wash. I don't mean along the seam where I could stitch it up easily either. I was so disappointed. It did shrink too. I wasn't intending to put it in the dryer, just let it air dry on the frame. The hamper isn't in a visible place so I still use it with just the frame and the mesh liner."
3,Excellent Views but Lacking Detail,"My interest leans toward the detail in the evolutionary differences between the tepui plants and animals compared to that of the lower forest. I don't feel the film gave much detail about the subject. It covers location, climate and history of attempts to access the tepui(s) but little of the biology."
3,Expected More...,"First, the positives: Great photography. That about covers it.Now, the negatives: The constant ""brass"" music became overwhelmingly annoying. Also, as another reviewer mentioned, there was little detail about the biological and botanical discoveries; there was little to no information on whether or not any aboriginal people now or ever lived on the tepuis. I realize this plateau has not been thoroughly explored, but a bit more information would have been welcome. I probably would not purchase this dvd."
5,GREAT DOCUMENTARY!,Whats to say? I loved this show. It was ver good and you should see it to find out where the lost world is based on.
5,A classic gets better,"The first edition is already a classic in its exploration of the nature of suffering. ""Bodies do not suffer, only persons suffer."" is a central concept. The text examines the doctor patient relationship, what diseases are, how understandings of disease have changed over time, how the unique and particular nature of the sick person influences all diseases and how they are cared for. How we know who a person is. Why medicine is changing its focus from the disease to the sick or well person. The new edition has three new chapters that focus on the mind-body problem, social contribution to sickness and dying, and how pain and other symptoms are inevitably personalized. And how suffering arises from the sickness and its personalization. It is a well-written,rich and exciting book."
1,NOT a good selection of flatware,"My husband and I registered for this at Target and received them as a wedding gift. Within three weeks, I noticed that they were rusting on the handles. Thankfully, we did get a store credit from Target, but now we are without a regular set of flat ware."
2,Pretty but not durable,"We've had this flatware for about a year and a half. I really like the look of them, but they started showing rust spots pretty quickly. One serving piece is completely unusable because it's started to degrade at the edge. When we first noticed the spots, I determined to wash them separately from other utensils, but that doesn't seem to matter. More spots keep appearing. The satin finish has held up pretty well, not scratching too badly."
3,The movie behind the hotel lobby and elevator music ---!,I had no idea what this movie was about but it is VERY well done because it had to be to introduce the concept of libertinism to the audience in a justified manner.I can understand why people especially parents objected to this film because while it instructed tolerance and sympathy for divorce and true love - like SUSAN SLADE - that sympathy came with the first step down a slippery slope of casual coupling for society.It is a very well done non tedious movie but I wouldn't recommend it to children.
4,A SUMMER PLACE,"SUPERB OLD CLASSIC.RATHER DATED IN ITS APPROACH TO EXTRAMARITAL SEX, DIVORCE AND MORALS BUT STILL GREAT NOSTALGIA."
3,"Review of ""Summer Place""","For its time, it was a good movie. But in comparison to today's movies it is lacking. It does bring back memories of when we were young."
2,Two stars for two good things,"There are two good things about this movie: Dorothy McGuire's beauty and Sandra Dee's beauty. Other than that, forget it. The movie feels interminable by about an hour. The story is shallow and strangely preachy, although it is supposed to be risque, I suspect. I do remember the ethos of 1959 very well. The characters are cliches--the drunk, the cutie, the hunk, the prude, the nice dad, etc. But the scenery is nice, especially when Ms. McGuire and Ms. Dee are on screen."
2,Entertaining to a point ...,"... the point being that, despite the film's subject matter being pretty hot stuff back then (a man and woman ""living in sin: after leaving their spouses, for example -- horrors!), most of this movie's just plain laughable at this point in time. It's over-the-top fake innocence and ""depth"" at its best. Nicely shot, however, with some great camera angles. But that' of course, isn't enough. And while Dee and Donahue were never great actors, it's extremely possible both hit their nadirs in this one. The score is the only thing memorable about it."
3,don't buy it,"Horrible & contrived plot- stepsister & stepbrother end up getting married and having a kid together. Unless you really like soap-like drama, this is not a quality movie."
2,Break Out The Bubble Gum...,"Although the subjects of teenage pregnancy and extra-maritial sex were hot stuff when A Summer Place first hit the screen, the film's niaviety is too dated to keep our attention and not quite silly enough provide more than a few chuckles with its unintentional campiness. The actors perform with deadly earnestness, the script is merely so-so, and the film seems much longer than it actually is."
2,Yucky 50's Psycho Babble,"This movie is too campy to be earnest, but too earnest to be campy. I was expecting some sort of Annette/Frankie kind of romp, but instead got a sad sack movie that tried way to hard to pound home some dubious points. Sandra Dee's mother is a tiny bit of fun as the evil queen type, and the scenes where Sandra is being subjected to various cruelties to assure her virtue stays intact were sort of amusing, but other than that and some beautiful scenery (and that fantastic theme song), I was pretty unimpressed. For those people who like 50's architecture there is a great house towards the end that is supposedly a Frank Lloyd Wright design."
1,Well!?!,I didn't especially enjoy this movie. It was too sad and the relationship between families was unfortunate.
3,A True Guilty Pleasure!,"Everytime I watch ""A Summer Place,"" I can't help but get caught up in the story even though I've seen the movie many times. This story which surrounds taboo topics (for that time) such as extramarital affairs and sex before marriage. Sometimes you have to sit back and laugh to yourself at how scared people actually were of topics such as these back then.Regardless of your views on sex and marriage, this is definitely a film to watch. It is really good, although some of the scenes between Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue became a little mushy and unrealistic. I guess this film shows you that love can overcome obstacles that are put in your way to oppress you.I would definitely recommend this film!"
4,Great memory,"This is one of the movies which one remembers due to the music ""summer place"". Today it looks like a naive and puritan movie (like Romeo and Juliet) which the new generation won't even understand. I liked it than and like it today and Troy and Sandra are a cute couple (not really great actors)."
4,dorie,I enjoyed watching this dvd. I watched this film some years ago on VHS video. I am glad to now own it on dvd.
2,Dated,It is just alright. I didn`t mind the earlier part of the film dealing with the adult`s problems but I got heartily sick of the teenagers. I guess the story is not so dramatic these days as it was when the film was made. Sandra Dee`s mother was a monster. Thank goodness the world is a bit less judgemmental now.
5,Love and Romance,"This film is a must for a collector. Brilliant acting by all and the music/theme is wonderful. I would recommend this as a ""chic's flick""."
4,A Summer Place,Have always enjoyed this film and happy to have the DVD. Can now dispose of the video version which was gathering dust due to no video player.
5,A SUMMER PLACE,This movie could send a message to young people today.It tells the story of two young people who took responsibility for their actions and asked for help.
5,A Summer Place,"Young love in the 50's....Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue are young and in love. I hadn't seen this movie in many years, but it brought back such great memories. It is a sweet story right out of the 50's. I truly enjoyed it!"
4,good aol movie,"like old movies, a clean movie no bad shot or vocabulary i had seen it years ago like the stars i it"
2,Unintentionally Funny,"How can a movie in which the Troy Donahue character uses the word, ""Supercilious,"" not be funny? Also, how about this line - when one character tells another, ""I love you,"" the male character replies, ""Me too you."" Who wrote this script? The plot was so convoluted and ridiculous that it was downright funny. In the end, did all your reviewers who gave this ""masterpiece"" of unintended fun 3 stars and above realize that a brother married his sister and vice versa (well, yes, they are step-brother and step-sister). Still, that's funny! If you like overacting, bad dialogue, terrible plotting, over the top melodrama, you will love this movie. I simply laughed the whole way through, and as I said, where else can you find a character actually spewing the word, ""Supercilious?"" The unintended fun brought this movie up from one star to two!"
5,Good as gold,Product was here fast. Came as pmomised. Very satisfied will be buying from this vendor again. Watched it as soon as it came. Haveseen it again since. Great shape and I am very pleased to watchsomething old and classic whenever I want. This is a great way to buy something you can' find in the stores. Keep up the good service.
5,Great classic movie!,This movie had just as much appeal as it did when it was first shown on the big screen! A definite classic to add to your collection.
4,why no dvd,"That this classic love-romance motion picture of the 50's is not out on DVD is incredible. The story may seem tame to the present generation but it was well ahead of its time. A haunting musical score, beautiful photography and sensitive performances by a well chosen cast have not dimmed this movie over time. Get with it Amazon and get this movie on DVD."
4,Guilty Pleasure,"The most revealing aspect of this film is it's honest portrayel of 1950's morality - American style. Sandra Dee and Troy Donahue, the reigning clean-cut teen idols of the time are star-crossed lovers Molly and Johnny. Richard Egan and Dorothy Maguire play Molly's Dad and Johnny's Mom respectively, who were star-crossed lovers in their youth - both (for the wrong reasons) marrying Molly's Mom and Johnny's Dad, respectively. Marriages that are as ""on the rocks"" as they could be. What transpires is as scandalous as movies could get for the period. All actors are adequate for their roles, if not one-dimensional. However it is Arthur Kennedy who brings great depth and layered insight into his role as Johnny's inebriate father. Kennedy was both a highly intelligent and gifted actor, and certainly underrated. His final scene when Johnny returns to the ""Summer Place"" is inspired. Picture quality is outstanding. 1:85 Anamorphic widescreen."
4,Great Gift,"My mother had been looking for this DVD a very long time, and the quality was perfect... especially when you consider that this was a Christmas Gift."
4,"Sturdy, looks great. Cheaper at HoDep","Looks great, very strong, easy to install. Fit perfectly. Use 3 inch screw to improve safety of your door. No one is kicking this down."
3,A brief overview of the CS2,"This book is ok. It didn't go into much detail per application, but you can't expect to learn everything about all of the CS2 products in one book. For me, having this book in addition to one or two books covering individual applications I use most (GoLive or InDesign for example) is a good mix."
2,Disappointed,"I've never left a review before although I've been a long-time amazon customer. I felt compelled to leave one for this product.It is more of a reference that reviews the features of the software, not an instructional guide.I bought this along with the Teach Yourself Flash 8. The Flash book covers ""Try it Yourself"" tasks, exercises and tips.I was so disappointed I threw the book away - something I rarely do. Adobe's Classroom in a Book is much better for someone trying to learn Adobe."
4,Nice item,"I bought two of these rings, one for me and one for my granddaughter. We are both very pleased.Quality jewelry."
1,very pleased- at first...,"I loved this ring when I first opened the box and put it on! It was a bit narrower than I expected, (things like this should be pictured actually ON a finger/hand in the ads, to give a good idea of the width). It had lots of sparkle, and the silver was brilliant.However, after wearing the ring for a week or two, the silver lost all it's shine and luster. The stones don't sparkle anymore either, even after cleaning. I've been wearing (two) sterling silver rings (plain bands) 24/7 for almost 30 years and they are still much shinier than this ring is after only two weeks. I'm quite disappointed. I'm not wearing it anymore..."
2,No package received,"I live overseas and somehow the item did not reach to me. It took 1.5 months of waiting for post and exchanging e-mails. Anyway, at the end they refunded my purchase."
1,not very high quality,"I ordered several rings, 2 of which are still in gift boxes, but the multicolored style, I ordered 1 of those, a pink and a blue one...the stones fall right out! The blue square stone channel set has not been given yet as it is a gift...I can only hope it has more staying power. Living on an island it would cost me more to return ship it than it would be worth, but I am not so satisfied with these products."
4,good.,"very pretty, very good price. it does fade a bit though, and now its much darker than when i got it (about 2 months ago). one stone fell out, but thats probably more my fault. definitly a good deal for your money."
4,my Favorite!,"I love the Eternity bands, so when I saw this one I had to have it. I gave 4 stars because half sizes are not available."
3,Stone Issue,"I agree with other posted comments about the stones coming out, I opened the cute box, took out the ring, a stone is gone, will not return as it is not worth returning. I believe we are paying for the cute box and not the ring itself, I have a few of these types of rings from other sellers, and no stones have popped out (yet)"
1,Prettyy...cheap,"I purchased several of these rings for my daughters for Christmas. They loved the looks of them and were delighted to receive them. However, in less than a month, two of them had stones fall out."
1,poor quality,"very pretty to look at, but sad to say very poor quality. lost 2 gems within 3 weeks. service was prompt. will order better quality products from this vender next time."
1,Buyer Beware!!!,"I purchased this ring because it looked beautiful and the price was a steal. Well, I knew it would be a piece of jewelry that would not last forever; however, my experience was ridiculous. The day I received the ring it lost a stone. Within a week 2 more stones fell out. It has been about 3 weeks since I got it and I can't even wear it anymore because it's lost about 25% of its stones! The shipping for return is not worth it."
3,pleased if I get the ring,Instantly my daughter loved the ring and so did I. Now 2wks later and the stones are coming out. I called the company and they say I have to return it for them to see it and I have to also pay another $4.99. Didnt I already pay shipping when I first ordered this ring???
4,Beware of the shipping rate!,"The ring is really beautiful. You can just mesmerize yourself twisting the ring around and seeing the different color gems around the ring. But I have to caution. The price is a steal, but beware of the $5 shipping rate. Other than that I have no complaints."
5,So Very Cute!!,"I bought this ring in a size 3 for a toe ring. It came much sooner than expected, this was the first surprise. Second surprise was the absolutely cute heart-shaped box with a bow on top that the ring came in! And the third surprise was the ring itself which fit perfectly and was totally true to the picture and looked even better in person. I'm already shopping for my second Gem Avenue ring!Kudos to Gem Avenue for supplying small rings for people who like fitted toe rings!!"
3,multicolored CZ band ring,"If you purchase this product, you should at least buy two since they are small. Two or more together makes a nice look---one you can hardly see it being worn."
5,Very nice ring,"This is a very nice ring, especially for the price. I am completely satisfied, and it arrived in a timely fashion. I'd buy something else from this seller."
3,Stones fall out,"Before i bought the ring, i read the reviews and i couldn't believe something as pretty as that, could have the stones falling off, so i bought it! Three days later the ring got to my house and i wear it, some stones fall off. I'm so mad right now, because it look so pretty but is ridiculous how is the 3rd day and has a few stones missing already... :("
5,I love my band!,"This band is absolutely beautiful. The sterling looks just like white gold, amazing. The stones look real. I am so glad, I wear it everyday. It suits anything you wear, casual to dressed up. Fantastic ring. Thank you!Lucie"
4,Just right.,"Just the right size for a small child, or, in our case, a statue outside that wants to get in the Christmas spirit."
1,Flimsy disappointment,"My son won't wear this hat because it's so scratchy, and ""dusty."" The lint sheds off into his eyes. I bought online bc I couldn't find a child's size in my neighborhood drugstore. Unfortunately, it's difficult to predict the quality from only a picture. Don't be fooled by this one."
3,Only for the Watrhouse afficionado...,"If you love Waterhouse and would like to understand his contemporaries a little bit better, then by all means purchase this book. However, if you are new to Waterhouse, you would be better served by purchasing either Anthony Hobson's or Peter Trippi's monographs on the artist. Noakes has tried to circumvent the scarcity of information on this very private artist by filling the pages with stories about other artists and their lives. The organization is odd, and the plates, which form the backbone of any artist biography, are poor, often displaying color shifts and bad contrast.Noakes has obviously done his research into the Victorian era art world and his tangents can be interesting, but the book falls short of those written by his predecessors. I give this book a rating of three stars (""It's OK""), whereas the other books on Waterhouse written by the previously mentioned authors would receive five stars each."
5,Hill Country Blues at its best,"This is music that from its first notes grabs your soul and shakes you. This is the ultimate expression of interplay between harmonica, guitar, and vocals. I find it amazing that Fred and Johnny didn't have to rehearse. I can think of no other album where two musicians exhibit such an understanding of eachother's playing. Everytime I listen to this album I'm sent into a blues-induced trance. Nothing in the world exists except for the wailing harmonica and slide, the rocking rhythm of the drone strings. If this music doesn't make you move your hips, then (in the words of Louis Jordan): Jack, you dead."
3,sand,kinda messy but works for the price not good when it gets wet my calmonun got a drink of water then got a lil sand on her face and it colored her red lol. its worth the money i would buy it again
4,Stair Builders Handbook,We were looking for a handbook for stair building. Our two top carpenters (25 years experience each) gave their approval.
5,An Epic,"I put this book in the running with my all time favorite ""Pillars of the Earth"" by Follet. The characters come to life, which is essential, and the environment envelopes you. With prayers throughout the day and a real sense of the Native Americans respect for the animals and the land which supports them. Quanah is a spiritual book riddled with humanity. It should be part of our educational system. I wish President Bush would read the book."
5,Bittersweet story of the journey of a lifetime for 2 women,"Turnip Blues is the bittersweet story of the journey of the lifetime for two 75-year-old women,Mrs. Kuzo and Mrs. Lemack. The two spunky women take a road trip from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia to visit Bessie Smith's grave. Along the way, the narrator, Mrs. Kuzo, ventures upon her interior life's journey, remembering her hard-scrabble life in a ""Hunkie"" (Slav-American) family in Depression-era Pittsburgh. This is one of the most beautiful novels I have ever read, and I am a voracious reader. When I was not moved to tears by Mrs. Kuzo's recollections of her life, I was laughing over Mrs. Lemack's antics. This is the kind of novel that you read a few times and recommend to your friends. It is an unforgettable story and the two 75-year-old leading characters are amazing women, who have withstood life's obstacles with humor and fortitude. I hope I am as spunky when I am 75-years old as these two women are!"
5,Booklist declares Turnip Blues a must-read!,"""An endearing story of enduring friendship, Campbell's first novel features two spunky 75-year-old widows, Mrs. Kuzo and Mrs. Lemack, driving across Pennsylvania to indulge the latter's whim to visit the grave of blues legend Bessie Smith. . . .Campbell gives us stunning charactes in a well-told tale that should have readers awaiting her second novel."""
5,Love this!,"I bought this pot because a friend of mine has a similar one, and I've loved it ever since I got it. It isn't a large teapot so if you're making tea for several people then this wouldn't be the way to go, but if you're making tea for just yourself or two people it works great. The only drawback I have with this tea set is that it gets very hot and so do the cups, so be careful when you pour it and go to take your first sip. Overall I would say this is a great price for this tea pot and it's worth it if you're looking for a one to two person set."
2,Soooo tiny....,"I guess I should have read more reviews or not tried to save money, but this tea pot was tiny! I would not recommend!"
1,not as expected,Smaller than expected and the lid would fall off. The pot itself was very well made but to small even for one person.
5,Great Tea Pot/Great Price,"I received my tea set in the mail today. I ordered a tea set because my three boys (ages 5, 5 and 8) absolutely love getting pots of tea anytime we go to a Chinese restaurant so I thought this would be a nice addition to the dinner table. WOW is this set a big hit!The tea pot is very heavy and retains heat beautifully. I only like my tea piping hot, so the smallish cups are actually perfect because the last sip is still hot. The set is very attractive. And the tea was delicious (I had to make five pots because my boys loved the tea so much!)This is MUCH better than I expected for the low price. I'm very happy with this purchase."
2,"Looks nice and does the job, but it started to rust!","This is a really nice-looking teapot. However, mine started to rust after only a few weeks of heavy use (I make about 5-6 full teapots of this size every day, sometimes more). I started noticing it in the spout, and then checked the inside to find that almost the entire interior was coated in a very fine layer of rust. None of it would break away into my tea, but I'm sure that continued use of this will cause that eventually. Now, it's become a wonderful decorative piece."
4,Very nice!,I got this as a gift for xmas and I love it. Very cute and it does keep the tea hot for a little while but not as long as I would like it to stay hot and the cute tea cups that came with the set do get a little warm if you use them so it is best not to fill them up and only grab the cups from the rim or use other cups but other than it is a very nice little set.
4,Cast Iron Tea Pot,Love the tea pot because it made of cast iron that holds the heat but not the tea cups because they get too hot to handle and they are black so you can't see the color of the tea.I recommend buying the teapot set and getting other Japanese ceramic tea cups.
2,awesome kit but loooong wait to get it,Personally i have absolutely no problems with the product. The tea set is small but exactly what I wanted for a birthday present. It would have been perfect if I would've got it on time!! I ordered this a month before my roommates birthday and still I did not recieve it on time. Disappointed.
4,"Great pot, but be careful","I like this teapot, and the price is good. I'm not such a fan of the cups, but the price on this set beats any other place I could find for the pot alone.One caveat: this pot does not have a 20 oz. capacity. Almost 16 oz. can fit, but you can't brew with that much because it is basically overflowing. A reasonable estimate of the actual capacity is about 13 oz. It's a good size for one person, but if you are thinking of brewing 20 oz for two, you will be disappointed. I am familiar with the other saucer-style pots available here. They aren't 20 oz either - probably around 16 oz, practically speaking, and also seem like a one-person pot to me. If you want tea for two, buy one that claims it has 30 to 40 oz capacity."
1,I've own Kafuh products and this wasn't one,"What I received was a cheap chinese knockoff in a generic box with no sticker, labels or the normal Kafuh usage tag. Since the only Amazon Fulfillment was JapanBargain that's who I used.Amazon was great setting up the return. Too bad it's a knockoff and not the real thing. Shady sellers out there."
5,Asian cast iron teapot set,"Received the cast iron teapot set which consisted of the small, two person teapot, a trivet, and two cast iron cups. It's a pleaseure to make tea using this set. Boil water in another teakettle, brew the tea in the iron tea pot, pour out nirvana. Well made, great looking. Only drawback is the fact that the cups get very hot, too hot to hold. Recommend small pot holders or Starbucks -like paper insulators to hold the cups. Otherwise, an excellent deal as I have seen other pots-only for hundreds of dollars. This set gives you everything you need at a fraction of the price without sacrificing quality."
3,"3 stars is considered,""it's okay"" This is better than ok but not for me","Like i said. 3 stars is ok. This pot is a lot smaller than i thought it was but that's okay. Two full coffee mugs and it's empty. The cups are rather small too. As my first set i thought it was pretty awesome. The cups it comes with are really small. I ended up just using my coffee cup eventually. The down falls to this set are this.Using the little cups, you find yourself pouring a lot more cups instead of 1 or 2 big ones. The problem with that is that the lid just slides right off so you have to start trying to pour while holding the lid nob down with your finger. That doesn't always work.Next i found that no matter how much i washed the cups, i ended up always tasting the cast iron on my lips and to say the least, it got old fast.So, like i said, cool but not that practical."
5,Good Safe,"What can I say...its a safe. It was very easy to program my own code, and seems sturdy and well made. Just for refernce, I would estimate that the inside is larger than a gallon-size milk container, so plenty of room for stuff. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase. It included the Batteries, keys in case you forget your code or the batteries die, and mounting hardware."
2,get what you pay for . . .,"this safe arrived broken. it's not made of quality materials. when they say ""anti-theft"", they really mean ""deterrent for a very quick smash and grab."" otherwise, it consolidates your valuables in one easy package for a thief. certainly bolting it to the floor would improve it's security, but all in all, it wouldn't take much to get this open."
2,Caution - this safe is NOT fire-proof!,"When entering a search on Amazon for a fireproof safe, the Honeywell #2050 is the first one to pop up. Wrong!It is NOT fireproof. It is only anti-theft. Based on the assumption that the fireproof feature was a given, we ordered two for our married children. Needless to say, both had to be returned. Surely Amazon could fine-tune their search results more effectively.Note: The low rating of item determined by it's failure to meet our expectations which were based on Amazon's representation."
3,Sensitive to vibrations!,"Bought this item for my girlfriend about 6 months ago... she had a bunch of stuff stolen from her softop Jeep Wranger, and needed a more secure storage location than the glove box (which can be opened with something as simple as a butter knife) when she's off surfing.I installed the safe in the rear of the vehicle, spot welding a couple of bolts to the floor and placing the safe on top.Recently though, the safe now just pops open when going over bumps... seems that continuous vibration on this model of safe is a simple way of getting it to pop open without cutting/bending/breaking. The internal mechanism simply 'releases' the door lock on something as simple as a 5 minute drive on normal LA roads.It was cool for the half a year, but now the thing is worthless. I know it's not rated for this kind of use, but I'm still disappointed."
1,Defective,"I really liked the safe; however, I think it was probably defective. When it arrived the battery door was ajar, bottom battery wasn't seated properly. Had husband to correct because I couldn't . Code wouldn't open it the 2nd time I used it. Had to use key; therefore, had to remove batteries. Again same problem replacing batteries. I'm normally very capable of installing batteries, but not in this safe. I did return it."
4,Good product,The product works just as advertised. It was easy to install and configure. This my second purchase of this item and both are working perfectly for me.
4,Small safe,This seems to be a good product. Had one problem that I was able to fix. It came with very corroded batteries in it.Amozon offered a new safe or a credit.They responded quickly.
2,Arrived Broken,"The safe looked sturdy, but arrival broken with something rattling in the door. We could not code anything in even when we changed the batteries. Other than that, the safe has nice features: hidden keypad behind batteries, heavy bolts to connect to the wall."
5,Great shelf safe,"I didn't want to get on my hands and knees to use. Installed in wall studs. Easy to open, easy to close. Fast and easy."
3,It works,It is okay for small items that you wouldn't want walking away but not good for keeping heat sensitive items safe in a fire.
2,NOT FIRE-PROOF!,This is NOT a fire-proof safe! I do not believe the product is represented accurately. I was very disappointed.Works well otherwise
1,Seriously????,"I can't believe this movie has such a high rating. Fellow Amazon customers, I depended on you and your opinions when I actually PAID to see this movie! Seriously, this should have NO stars. Bad acting except for the last second of the movie! I could go on and on about how bad this movie is, but it is SERIOUSLY not worth any more of my time!!!!"
3,"quite good with the shooting, but some funny stuff","Found this movie was quite okay with the way of how it was shot. Although no good special effects but for some of the scenes I think the director really did put some effort to deliver the horror feeling.However what I don't like is that little ghost girl always bending her neck without telling why, then she just bend it back to normal position, especial while one actress was asked to stay with this girl for a while and that girl bended back her neck, I felt like laughing out.However I was still disappointed a bit, so 3 stars"
3,UNDERWHELMING ADRIAN PAUL PERFORMANCE,"I AM A HUGE ADRIAN PAUL FAN. SINCE HE HAS MOVED ON FROM THE HIGHLANDER SERIES, HIS MOVIE CHOICES RUN THE WHOLE SPECTRUM: REAL GOOD TO PEEU. THIS WAS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE, AND CONSIDERING HE DIDNT HAVE MUCH OF A SPEAKING PART...3 STARS WAS GENEROUS. I WONT SPOIL IT FOR YOU IN CASE YOU'RE LIKE ME AND WANT TO SEE ANYTHING MR PAUL IS IN. THE OTHER REVIEWER WAS RIGHT- THERE ARE A FEW CHILLS FROM THE EFFECTS YOU CANT DENY. BUT THIS WAS A LOT LIKE ANOTHER "" CAMP FULL OF HAPLESS TEENAGERS ABOUT TO BE KILLED BY THE BAD GUY."""
3,It's okay,The more and more I get into this collection the less I recognize the songs.Got it cheap though.Part of a collection too.
3,American Wildlife,"This is an older program I picked up for a buck at a garage sale. It's not bad, mostly focusing on large and small mammals of North America. Here you'll see elk, caribou, deer, bears (grizzly and black), beavers, raccoons, river otters, etc., all in their natural habitat. Some of the footage is rarely seen, like the mother grizzly nursing her cubs right out in the open, on a mountainside. All things considered, I can think of worse ways to spend a half-hour.Three stars."
4,nice,Perfect sized notebook... just wished the rings were a bit bigger so MORE STUFF could fit in this Filofax ;)
5,syd is abolutely amazing,i first heard syd online theur myspace page and instantly fell in love with their sound. i downloaded fault lines in the next few days of first stumbling across theur page. i then went to a show of theirs at the knitting factory n purchased it there. after that concert i downloaded week days weak knees n now listen to both albums constantly! syd is absolutely amazing!!
5,Great end to a beautiful story,After I've got a tip from a colleague to read read the first book Hyperion I've read all four in one breath. The Hyperion saga pictures a terryfing and beautiful future and is of the same level of the Dune and Foundation series (or even better). The speed of the storyline was chosen well. The Rise of Endymion is a good end to the Hyperion saga for it clarifies most of the event of the earlier books. I am looking forward to an new serie. A great compliment to the Dutch translator! Le Jub 1998
5,Fabulous,"Dan Simmons has held me captive with his Hyperion series for years. I have become so personally involved with the characters that it was hard to believe they are ""mortal"". The whole series is compelling. Read them all."
1,"if you want to read this book, choose again but something else.","Somehow I find major antagonists of this ""epic"" very likeable. Maybe because all they did always made sense and they were never surrounded by long and irrelevant details as the story unfolded. I have become very empathetic with the Pax leaders toward the end of the book. And, by the way, their misdeeds could never possibly reach the magnitude of the crimes committed by Aenea, who finally doomed the humanity to extinction."
2,Worst book in the series. DON'T BOTHER WITH IT.,"After the first two suppendous books in the Hyperion series, I had high hopes for ""Endymion"" and ""Rise of Endymion"". However, both are surprisingly dissappointing. Simmons chooses not only to add on to his original story but also to CHANGE some of the plot already established by the first two books. Besides not meshing with the rest of the series, these last two books, especially ""Rise of Endymion"" lack any of the author's original brilliance and seem to be a disparate attempt to tack another two books onto a story that should have been left alone.In conclusion, there really should have only been one Hyperion book. The first two should have been combined into one and the last two shouldn't have been published at all. DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH ""ENDYMION"" OR ""RISE OF ENDYMION""!"
3,A very mixed opinion......,"Regrettably I have a very mixed opinion. I truly dug the first two in the series, especially the second novel. The third was interesting, due to its jump in time, but okay. This however was so wordy I actually skipped pages due to its boring content, and that is what bums me out. A couple of others mentioned the same thing, so I do not feel that bad giving it a mediocre review. It's good that Simmons wraps up all the answers, but why so long I ask? It is with regards to the exploration of religion and its differences with other cultures/religions, as well his concept of the marginalization of such groups---that is why. It was like reading a cruddy college freshman essay on the differences in culture and religion for an anthropology class. Hence its wordiness. I think it's the worst of the novels. At least I know now about the identity of the Shrike, and other answers from the other books in the series. That is the only reason I give it a 6."
5,"Rise of Endymion - not perfect, but do we care?","When I became aware that this latest volume in the Hyperion series was available, I had to have it - no waiting for the UK publication, or the paperback edition. It was enough that I could look forward to a resolution, or at least a progession, of the compelling themes of the Hyperion series. I suspect that my reaction was fairly typical of Hyperion junkies everywhere. In the end we get progression rather than resolution, as Simmons tells a story which is utterly absorbing in its own right, but leaves a number of threads from the previous volumes still hanging, and a few anomalies. The book even seems at times, dare I say, a little rushed, such that you get the feeling he might care to take another cut at it, and re-edit it in the future.But do we care about such imperfections? Admit it - we're all on edge, waiting for the next volume just as eagerly as we waited for this one. Nobody does it better."
4,Solid Ending To A Grand Epic,"I enjoyed the time travel plotline bit though you saw it coming early on.I enjoyed getting answers to many mysteries.I enjoyed the schroedinger box plot line.I enjoyed how he ends up ""beating"" the core.I get why he had to have them visit so many worlds and then why he had to visit so many on his own but I admit that the tour guide of the post farcaster fall Human worlds was a bit tiresome after about the 20th stop."
4,Worth waiting for,"I have only one complaint about this novel: it spends far too much time rehashing what already happened. If some poor sap can't remember what just happened in Endymion or back in Fall of Hyperion, it would benefit him to go back and reread it rather than spending hundreds of pages in long winded reiteration.Beyond that, The Rise of Endymion is truely a fitting end to a glorious tale. It is all about the evolution of humanity, the evolution of our souls, into something greater. It touches upon how security really only leads to enslavement, comfort to the death of the soul. Instead, we must all reach and strive to become something more rather than what we already are. It is breathtaking.Vary rarely does the end of a multi-book series deliver the goods. So I advise you all to muddle through the redundant parts and look forward to the juicy ends."
3,eBook GLARING with errors.,"This is a comment not just on this book, but all four of the Hyperion Cantos. To the publisher, you did a terrible job proofreading the ebook version of this.I love this series, it's incredible. It deserves 5 stars. It IS 5 stars when I refer to the story. That being said, almost every other page had terrible errors that detracted from the experience."
2,"yadda, yadda, yack","This book is in desperate need of an editor; at least 250 pages should be cut. Simmons introduces many new two dimentional characters. There is not too many characters, but rather, few too many interesting ones. I have about 100 pages to go and am seriously hitting the marathon runners wall on this book.For those who are interested... Gene Wolfe's ""Book of the new sun"" is a very good SF series."
4,A Great End to Simmon's Hyperion Cantos,"The Rise of Endymion is wonderful. A surprise ending is in store for those who read it; an ending that you will realize you should've seen coming all along.Of course, the book is filled with so many details at times that it is tedious, but those moments always pass and the genius of Dan Simmons prevails.Not only is this sci fi epic a great space opera, it is also a tender love story that is made personal for the rader through the narration of Raul Endymion as he awaits death in his Pax-authorized holding cell called a Schrodinger cat box.In the end you will get to meet characters you probably never thought you'd see again: Fehdman Kassad, Het Masteen, Sol Weintraub's daughter, Father Paul Dure, etc.Read this book, I command thee."
4,An epic read,"To those familiar with the other 3 books, Rise reads much more like Fall of Hyperion than the other two in that the scope of the novel is simply epic. This book is one you should read at least the Hyperion's to ramp up to as the plot is intertwined almost completely.I honestly found that there was very little that went on in the book action wise as was the focus in Endymion (i.e. the physical flight to old earth by the old farcaster portals). Instead, the book is a rather comprehensive space opera that tries to describe the galaxy spanning events leading up to the final days of the story.For those that relished the action sequences of the first and third books, I fear this is not the 700 page gorilla you want to find in your closet. For those that enjoyed the larger plot as described in Fall of Hyperion, you should have a ball reading this as I did."
4,Pretty good,"I loved the first two in the series. This was way too long and overdone. Although I liked it overall, the book was hurt by Aenea. She annoyed the hell out of me. Somehow, she knew everything taht ever happened. Also, the plot was a bit predictable. The First two aRe much better."
3,S.O.S.D.D.,"More of the same stuff from Dan Simmons. Which is not entirely a bad thing, for a writer of his caliber. Pretty good space opera, reasonably interesting characters. The only thing that really grated on my nerves is the hatred Simmons seems to have for Catholics (and Christianity in general.) It comes through in the story and you can tell these are really *his* prejudices, as opposed to the ideas of his characters. I am not a huge Simmons fan, but this book will probably please them. Other than the bigotry (which runs through the whole series, I am sorry to say), I enjoyed it pretty much. Especially getting all those loose ends tied up... :)"
1,Horrific. Pure torture.,"First of all, I loved the first three books. And, actually, Part One of this book. But after that it's like the original, brilliant author died, and some imposter with no talent stepped in and took over from there. The book becomes so boring that I skipped over large portions of it, something I have *never* done before. (I will normally just stop reading, but with this being the last in a series, I felt compelled to finish it.) There are pages upon pages of dense, pointless description of landscapes that I could just not care less about. I would glance ahead, and see that there was no dialogue for six pages, and just skip to that point. I mean, it got so bad that I thought the author had to be intentionally messing with me, which made me angry. I found this book to be personally offensive.Please read all the other bad reviews and be warned, because they're all true."
4,troublant épilogue,"Il va de soi que l'on ne peut dénier aux deux premiers ouvrages de cette quadrilogies une prééminence naturelle sur leurs suivants mais il serait absurde de se priver de la veine romantique de ces derniers... Si de nombreux lecteurs soulignent à juste titre la relative tiédeur d'Endymion et de l'éveil d'Endymion (the rise of Endymion)face à la monstruosité des perpectives que nous donne à partager Simmons dans les précédents opus, bien peu en revanche semblent goter à l'insondable beauté de cet idylle par delà le temps et l'espace. Raul Endymion est beaucoup plus profond que certains voudraient le laisser croire, de mme qu'Enée exerce une fascination que sa douce simplicité exacerbe, il s'en trouve créee une osmose troublante et palpable entre deux tres aux destins tragiques et formidables... Dire que j'ai aimé serait faire insulte à l'aveuglement de mes sens devant pareille vision."
5,Excellent.,"A wonderful end to the series. Science fiction with a human touch, which some purists might not appreciate, but for the average sci-fi reader a welcome change. Who cares about the philosophy? The characters were well-developed.. and the end was moving."
5,A beautiful conclusion to a contemporary future myth...,"I had hesitated when I read some of the negative reviews that categorized this particular book as being ""a bore"". I've seen other series wind down to an embarassingly pathetic end after glorious beginnings (Dune, Ender's Game), and I was afraid that this would ruin in my mind the beautiful tapestry the first three books had presented...But I was wrong. This last book left me shaking. It combines the personal passion found in such great detail in Hyperion with the galactic opera found in Fall of Hyperion and Endymion... and promises a climax that will leave you with its afterimages for days to come...All I can think now is how sad I am the series and the wonderful world that has been revealed to me over these four books has to end now."
2,Maddening and ultimately a disappointment,"There's so much filler, such poor writing and a lack of the kind of imagination and pacing from the earlier books, that I was seriously tempted not to finish it but wanted some answers after all those other pages. My suggestion is to find someone to tell you the plot and resolutions instead of wasting your time reading this incriminating indictment of Simmons' fall from artistry, professionalism and conscience. If you're stuck with time on your hands and you can't sleep, then at least you've had your expectations lowered."
3,"Too much philosophy, not enought story","I like the characters, although I found Aenea a little tiresome. I like the story. I didn't mind the inconsistencies. But, there is page after page of philosophical expository that just needed to go. Like several others who reviewed this book, I skipped many pages in an attempt to get to the point."
5,How about 100?,"First of all, anyone who even bothered to individually rate the Hyperion saga books should have their heads examined. How could you rate an individual part of a tale? This book brings to close some of the most complex and wonderful characters and story ever to be put onto paper and makes you feel like a weathered traveler at the end. It is almost offending to have to try and put into words how good it is. For those who had to wait the couple of years for each to come out, I would suggest reading them back-to-back-to-back-to-back so every single one of the unbelievable many angles and subplots is fresh for the understanding."
3,"Good yarn, tired yarn, old yarn breaks easily","Overall, this series was well done if a little predicable.If you can not figure out the ending before you read it, perhaps you should go to college and enroll in a Kiddie Lit. class. The ending really ruined the series for me."
1,the absolute WORST book of the series,PLEASE listen to me and ignore all favorable reviews toward this book. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SPEND ANY OF YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK. If you wish to be masochistic then at least get the book for free at a library and only waste your time. I would have given it neagative stars.
