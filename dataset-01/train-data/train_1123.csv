3,Boring Ending,"I liked the book Bloomability by Sharon Creech, but at the end of the book nothing exciting happens. I wish something actually happened and the end. Then there could be a sequal about Dinnie and Guthrie."
1,This is a big disapoitment,"This book is a big disapointment. I loved Walk Two Moons, Absolutly Normal Chaos, and Chasing Redbird. So naturally I was very excited when this one came out. Dinnie was a bad character the only thing good about her was that she showed how insecrure moves can make children. And Guthrie lived in some kind of sick fantasy world. What kind of teenager goes around shouting ""I am a transparent eyeball!"" Give me a break. And ""such the best."" Who in their right mind says ""such the best?"" Lila was the only decent character. I loved how she expressed her opinions so clearly. She was a well established character."
5,DON'T BE A DUMMY!!!!!!,"Don't be a dummy. Any fool knows the brothers Chess, Leonard and what's his name virtually wrote the book when it comes to Chicago Blues. It's a no brainer. Now I ask you, where else do you find a more classic lineup of stars? From Muddy to Wolf, from Little Milton to Buddy Guy, John Lee to JB, (Lenoir that is) And let's not forget Willie Dixon and Bo Diddley and so many more.And what about the songs from Hi Heel Sneekers to Mona, to Suzie Q to I Just Want To Make Love To You.......to Sweet Little Sixteen to Trouble No More..........Well you know the rest. Afterall the title of the record is Blues-Rock Songbook......That says it all....So don't be a dummy...All right?"
4,Really nice Chanukah songs,"Well sung, easy to hear and understand the words. Some are new to me and having the words would help a lot. Also, we don't know who is singing these songs - a pity. I would buy more recordings by this singer.Overall, I like it, I like it!"
1,WARNING for potential buyers,"I'm sure this game is fairly good. That said, I need to issue a notice and warning to all potential future buyers of this product.It is not by fault of any seller really. It seems to be with the game publisher and manufacturer. Ubisoft is not known for customer support as they don't really believe in it. Quality control for most if not all of their products seem non-existant.Do a thorough internet search and you'll get a feel that about 25-35% of people cannot install this game due to faulty manufacturig processes. So be warned."
4,One of the best,This is a very fun and challenging game. It's graphics in the movies aren't very good but i would still recommend this game for anyone who liks RPG's
4,Solid Milton Campbell Collection,"Little Milton Campbell was a popular blues/R&B; singer of the 60's and early 70's. This collection shows that he was a talented singer and musician, and while he was more R&B; than blues, his songs often had the bluesy feel that one would expect from someone performing on Chess Records.""We're Gonna Make In,"" ""So Mean To Me,"" ""Man Loves Two,"""" Who's Cheating Who?"" and ""We've Got the Winning Hand"" and many of the other cuts on this record are entertaining and harken back to an era when the lines between blues and R&B; seemed indistinguishable. This is an excellent collection."
5,Great,Little Milton hits the Bull on the Behind here.His Music Sounds Great&his Voice is very strong.He Puts alot into his Music you feel the force&it is strong all the way thru.A Must Have by this Great Talent.
5,Country Store,"Pleased with this. Easy to assemble, took my husband about 4 hrs, to paint, cut, sand and assemble. Fun project, great addition to the train layout."
3,Meh,"Good characters, not so good game play, its worth to note that this game is a copy of the Ratchet and Clank, Jak and Pikman games just all rolled into one minus the fun."
2,Modern additions to a classic,"This set only includes a few of the beloved and trusted earlier books. Most of the writing is fine, but the artwork...ugh! Spacey-eyed children and a gruffish Jesus is not what I expected from this series. The 5 older classics in the set are great, but we can do without the ""hipper"" version. My children make fun of the artwork instead of listening to or reading the stories. This was not the idea."
5,"Wonderful book, from one who normally does not like Fiction","It's true that a beginning writer would have had a difficult time in finding a publisher for this book. It didn't hurt that Mr. Carter was once our President. However, to write a book like this, you have to have knowledge and compassion - I could never imagine some of our other former Presidents even trying to write anything like this - Johnson, Nixon, Clinton or the Bushes? Read this book, as it is entertaining, enjoyable, and if nothing else, a book you can learn from."
5,This conservative now a big fan of Jimmy Carter the writer!,"A vivid description of the struggles of daily life on the frontier combined with graphic descriptions of military engagement, weaponry, tactics, strategy, and political motivation moved my senses so intensely that I felt like I was one of the participating characters. Wow! Never read anything so revealing about this turbulent period of time. Mr. Carter will be hard pressed to ever top this one!"
3,Mr. Carter Steps Out,"Mr. Carter steps out into the world of fiction. I enjoyed his venture. I think that he could have and should have given more life to Espy--the forward and somewhat headstrong young woman who enticed a slightly older young man to engage in conversation with her. She led him to her home and into her life through the offer of botinical books. It would seem that he could have given more life to this less than comunicative grown woman who traveled through the wilds with her husband and finally got close enough to conceive and bear a child.The descriptions of the conflicts and the parties involved were great and it is easy to see that the author is more comfortable with these types of descriptions than those of family interactions. He is especially not easy with a even an gentle ""toss in the hay"". That's all right tho' neither is half the male population I think.Over all the ""Hornets Nest"" is a good afternoons read and one most folks that enjoy historical novels will enjoy."
1,Ration the research,"Indeed,Jimmy Carter has done an impressive amount of research. And by golly, he has used it all. When reviewing a novel, this should be a reason to delete stars, rather than award them.Cramming in all the research at which they worked so hard is a common failing of novice historical fiction writers, but fortunately for them, they are not former presidents of the United States, so their initial efforts never embarrass them in print. Either Mr. Carter's editors (and we know who they are, because he names them) were overawed by his impressive past, or recognized that turning this turgid recitation of facts into anything resembling a novel would be a hopeless task."
2,"Will someone please teach Carter to show, not tell?","I hoped to like this book. I have a great deal of respect for Carter, and he clearly knows his historical subject in detail. I also have lots of patience and even enthusiasm for historical detail in fiction--I'm currently reading Neal Stephenson's Quicksilver series, which has a similar level of clearly well-researched detail included. However, Carter's fiction writing style is some of the most tedious I have encountered. I bravely soldiered on to page 90something before giving up in glassy-eyed despair. Every page is exposition, beginning to end, even the dialogue! Characters consist of historical explanations of the details of their lives. I felt like I was reading a long-winded description of a novel, or perhaps of the lengthy backstory notes for a novel, rather than the novel itself. I wish Carter the best, and hope that his fiction writing improves with experience."
4,Great job Mr.President,Jimmy carter does a great job of giving information in this book and teaches readers a lot about the American Revolution in the southern collonies. He does a great job of adding historicle facts to this historcle fiction novel!If you like social studies READ THIS BOOK!!!you learn a lot about a subject that has been looked past because people are so interested in the major battles in the north with General WashingtonGood job Mr.President well writen
3,"Good, but not great.","President Carter deserves credit for doing a novel about the southern theater of war during the American Revolution. It is time and past time that we delve into that region during this period, which is generally ignored or glossed over in our schools.The characters in this book aren't developed terribly well, and the writing seems labored at points, but since this is Carter's first novel he can be forgiven for that.I enjoyed it, and although I only gave it three stars I would recommend this novel... especially to anyone who has an interest in that particular part of our national history."
4,From a history lover,"President Carter demonstrates that he was not only a wonderful President and man, but also a good researcher, writer and teller of stories with his first work of fiction. For someone who loves history and lives in Georgia, this was a fascinating look into a time in the history of our region about which very little is known or understood. I learned a lot and thoroughly enjoyed the story line, the characters and the history!!"
4,The Revolution in the South,"I might not have read this book if I had not gone to a book signing by President Carter. I had not been particularly interested in the subject.I gave it four stars rather than three for two reasons: President Carter's research is astounding, and the book did keep my interest throughout.I do agree with most reviewers that it is a history book trying to be a novel. But I did not mind. I acually found Ethan, the fictional protagonist, to be a flawed but sympathetic human being, like most of us.""The Hornet's Nest"" shows the ugliness and brutality of the American Revolution. There aren't too many ""heroes"" here (a much over-used word anyway). It gives one pause for thought about who the American people really are.I do hope President Carter writes a sequel or at least a history of the next 20 or 30 years in the South."
4,History comes alive,"This is a wonderful story, well told. It will keep your interest and you will learn a little about the beginnings of uor country."
2,"Wonderful, for a TEXTBOOK, not a NOVEL!","This book did bring me a lot of information about the revolutionary war in the Southeast of United States, tha's a thumb for Mr. Carter. But, Mr. Carter, this book is call a novel is because it merely have characters with misplaced love and dialogues. This book is kind of hard to delve deep in. For history lover, I recommand it, but time-killer, I would say no.The book take place in Southeast of United States, and specifically in the frountiersman social class. Ethan Pratt, the main character, transformed from a careless person to a patriot, and have a position in the revolutionary war. The book also included misplace love, that Espey, Ethan's wife, divorce from him, and he fall in love with his best friend and also neighbor's wife, Mavis."
1,Consistently Lackluster,"This book follows the pattern established by the former president who has once again stepped far beyond his natural skillsets. Carter is a decent, compassionate and intelligent man who was a mediocre president, at best. He is a worse author. ""The Hornet's Nest is a lackluster tale, bereft of coherent plot and wanting well developed characters that effectively link history and fiction. Mr. Carter should stick to his knitting as a concerned humanitarian."
1,Great Research,"Jimmy Carter has done an admirable job of research on a part of the Revolutionary War that has most of us know little about. Unfortunately, Jimmy Carter's first-rate research is undone by his limited skills as a writer - especially a writer of fiction.It is ultimately a great deal like his presidency: the best of intentions, a good mind, and poor results."
1,"It re-defines the word ""novel""!","Make no mistake: if the author of this book were NOT a former President of the United States, his manuscript would never have seen the light of day. He seems determined to pack in every event related to the Revolution that occurred in the south during a twenty year period--at the expense of character development, plot, narrative drive and dramatic tension. If a reader actually reaches the last page, he or she will have a pretty good idea of what happened in the south during the Revolutionary War. But if that's your purpose, I could list several histories of the period that do the job better, not this textbook masquerading as a novel."
2,I was excited to read this....,"I believe that Jimmy Carter is a fine man with a good heart and an admirable mind. ""Sources of Strength"" was an inspiring book to me. So I waited in line for 3 hours to have Mr. Carter sign my copy of ""The Hornet's Nest."" But that's where my story takes a turn for the worse. Because then I read the book. And it's not great. The ratio of telling to showing is really bad, the dialogue is stilted, etc... I finished it as a matter of principle. But I would not recommend it to a friend looking for a good read. I've given it 2 stars simply because the research that went into the book was obviously so extensive. And I learned some interesting things. But now I know why no other former presidents have written fiction. It's harder than it looks! (And I'm not a writer.)"
1,majorly lacks character devolpment.....,"It's obvious that Jimmy did extensive research for the book and it could have been a really interesting read for that reason except that Jimmy did a lot of telling rather than showing, a very elementary rule not to be broken in fiction writing. Parts of the book are also overly repetitive. Often I was informed of the same fact over and over, and I had only read as far as page 50... His book reads more as an outline and a catalog of historical details. It may be hard to be in the hotseat as the editor of this book, but it is truly a shame that the editor did not do his or her job in editing. If only it could have been polished up a little bit before publishing, by fleshing out the characters more, eliminating the repetiveness and the political correctness, it would have been a more enjoyable read."
3,"Starts off good, but fizzles out.","This book is divided into three sections. With the first section being by far the more interesting and best developed one. It is phenomenal the amount of detailed and intimate knowledge the author has on the early colonial period lifestyle. Every sentence has an incredible amount of fascinating history in it. The main flaw is that the author doesn't let the characters develop throughout the story. He'll just state the whole courtship in one paragraph. I wasn't too thrilled with the outcome of the story either. The main character committing adultery is not my thing.In sum, the history is fascinating but the characters lacking after the first section. I ended up skipping a hundred pages in the middle because it got to be too dull. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the first section or ""book"" has it is called."
2,"History does NOT come alive, unfortunately","I wanted to like ""The Hornet's Nest"". I'm becoming more and more of a history (and, by extension, historical fiction) buff these days, and when my brother lent me this book I accepted it eagerly. However, his initial reservations (""It's badly written; I can't get into it"") were absolutely on the money.Sad but true--the book is a failure. Though his subject matter is interesting (the Revolutionary War as it was fought and experienced in the South) and his research is thorough and admirable, Jimmy Carter is simply unable to bring it all alive in novelistic form. Style is required in the writing of a novel, and Mr. Carter doesn't have it. Page after page of thudding exposition and flat dialogue from stiff characters cripple the story's momentum to the point of exasperation. Though I learned from the book, I didn't enjoy it -- of course your mileage may vary, but proceed with caution."
2,"Great Humanitarian, Okay President, Dismal Novelist","I love American History.However, I feel as though I was being lectured to in this book. President Carter has certainly done his homework and has researched well.Hornet's Nest certainly is not a novel, but more of an outline of historic facts, with added conversation. The characters have flat personalities. You do not get to know or care about any of them. THE whole book is written on a sixth grade level. It may be wonderful to a student in a special needs class, with limited vocabulary and reading skills who needs American History written in a very clear, flat manner.. Very disappointing."
2,Good Research - Bad Novel,"I have to agree with the reader from Pasadena, CA. President Carter did a fabulous job of research. But, it did not flow as a novel. The first half of the book was bogged down in waaaay too much detail about the main characters. The second half of the book flowed much better in terms of integrating the details with the story."
4,The Revolutionary Rebels Won the South,"President Carter has brought to life the story of The American Revolutionary War with great detail and exciting verbage. I knew nothing at all about the South and it's participation in the war and his book has wet my interest to learn more. The next book I read will be Savannah to Yorktown by Henry Lumpkin. Unfortunately the editor could have made the book better if he actually read from beginning to end.It lost momentum with to much detail about a vist to a cabin between action scenes near the end.And both women in Eathans life lived ""Northward"". I think Mavis won him,and he should have said so more clearly."
4,Interesting with a lot of action and detail,"I liked this book and think it worth your time, regardless of your politics.+ Action and attention to detail.+ Just enough moralizing to give it a substantive feel. Carter does a great job explaining why ""hearts and minds"" and not committing atrocities help a campaign win. He gives a version of the facts that rings more true than the sugar-coated glossed over version that I was fed in high school.- There are lousy, stilted, and awkward sex scenes. Seems like an editor was saying there had to be some horizontal action to make it a novel. The book would have been a lot stronger if these had been edited out completely. After all, this was written by Carter, not a more, ahem, experienced president :-)- The ""story"" aspects run out of steam about 2/3 of the way through. Part of the problem is that we all know who won the war. Also, some of the more interesting characters are killed off with a lot of book left to go."
4,The Hornet's Nest,Interesting story line. It gave me new insight regarding the Revolutionary War and how the South and particularly Georgia was involved.
4,I thought I was reading a James F. Cooper novel,"I've read the other reviews and find the novel left me with a different feeling than most. J.F. Cooper did the public a service by telling tales of Natty ""Hawkeye"" Bumpo and his two indian friends. We vivedly learned about the dangers of life in rural America at a time when European authors were the rage. Jimmy Carter is not J.F. Cooper, but he accomplishes the same thing. He takes a part of our war for independence that isn't in the forefront and explains it to us in a relational way that is easy to understand. I learned something of husband/wife relationships in the rural south, how neighbors interacted, farming and how to build a log cabin. This book opened my eyes to the plight of early Americans and their struggle to do what was right. I recommend this book. The research was great!"
2,Perhaps he should stick to non-fiction.,"I have thoroughly enjoyed several works of non-fiction by President Carter. And I greatly admire him. However, I found this a s-l-o-w read. Some parts of this book were very interesting to me because of the historical insights. But since it was a novel, I expected to find some central characters who reappeared pretty consistently throughout the book. However, just about the time I would become interested in a character, he abandoned that character (sometimes permanently and sometimes for several chapters), leaving me ""stranded.""I have always had interest in the social impact of history, including that of wars. Perhaps someone more interested in specific strategy and the details of battles would enjoy this book more than I."
4,vhs,"Although this tape was exactly what I ordered, at a good price, and arrived in a timely manner and in good condition, its subject/content was not as enjoyable as I anticipated. ""My bad."""
2,I just doesn't last very long with regular use.,"I purchased this item at the beginning of November 2006 and it is not working any more. First the remote went on the blink after about a year and now the dvd player itself has died.So, I please note that with regular use it lasts about a year and a half. Something to think about for the price of USD 160.00"
4,Good DVD player for the money,"The DVD player has excellent picture quality. My only complaint is the way the battery mounts. It extends off the back which then makes the player too big to fit in most carrying cases. So you have to unplug the battery to carry the player around in a case. But I do like the player, we use it often. The battery does last 3-4 hours, which is nice on planes."
4,Wish the battery were part of the player,"The screen is great, the sound is great, and it's nice and small for the screen size and price. The battery that has to be attached is cumbersome. Trying to pull all the pieces together (DVD player, battery, headphones, movie) on a tiny airplane pull down table was a pain. The only time I'll probably use this is with the battery, so if that's what you'e looking for, this may not be the one to buy."
3,Toshiba not at all versitile,"We bought the Toshiba 1850 portable dvd player to play videos for my daughter. Many of the videos are a collection of Barney videos we own that I converted. This DVD player would not play any of them. We recorded them on a different disk and a different format and it still would not play our disks. (I sent back this product and went to get another one) I went to a nearby electronics store to purchase another one and took the DVDs I wanted to play with me to be certain they would work. Guess what? Every portable DVD player there played my home movies, the collections AND some of them even played the DivX even though they didn't advertise it. I tried the Toshiba 1900 portable DVD player and had the same exact results as I did with the 1850. I would not recommend this at all if you intend on playing home movies or movies you have converted from VHS."
2,DEAD PIXEL IS TRUE!!!,"As many other customers I didn't believe in the problem of the dead pixel and decided to take the risk. Unfortunately when I first opened the Toshiba SD-P1850 the dead pixel was there right in the middle of the screen.I live in Dominican Republic and for me it will be very difficult to return this item (and probably very expensive to do it), so I will have to live with this red pixel in the DVD's screen for as long as it works.Please don't make the same mistake!!"
3,Just ok,The volumn is low...and you can hear the motor of the dvd as it's turning....the good point...picture is beautiful
2,"""Never operate in moving vehicle""","Like others, I did a lot of research before choosing the SD-P1850. The description of the unit says ""Take your favorite entertainment on the road with you and keep your kids entertained during long car trips with the slim-profile Toshiba SD-P1850 portable DVD player"". Imagine my surprise when I read the owner's manual and in several places it warns "" Do not operate the player in a moving vehicle. Vibration may prevent proper playback or cause damage to the disc."" And ""Do not use the player in a place subject to vibration."" And yet, it includes a vehicle adapter. What are we supposed to do with it? Send the kids out to the car to watch videos while the car remains in the driveway?"
2,I'm a bit disappointed,"I've used cheaper machines that were much better. The picture is not crisp and clear. I hate the separate battery pack. It sticks out and gets in the way. The power adaptor has a huge ""brick"" attached to it. Since the battery pack only lasts about 4 hours, I need to travel with the power adapter and it weighs almost as much as the unit itself.Also the unit doesn't come with headphones. All in all, I wish I'd gotten something else."
2,No resume regardless of previous reviewers confusion,"There is no true resume feature with this player. Resume is when the unit is power off and goes into a stanby mode. When turned back on the program begins at the point is was at. This unit does NOT do this. Why any one thinks ""resume"" is when you stop and then hit ""Play"" is unique does not know what a true resume feature is. The Sony has this feature as does a Zenith unit and Nortech Media 10.2 unit.As it turns out if the stop button is pressed and the lid is closed, the unit will go into standby (sort of) opening the lid and pressing play will get you back to the place it stopped. So a resume does exist after a fashion"
1,it does not work,"I'm so frustrated, I chose this because I thought I would not have any problem, but it doesn't work.:("
1,"Pretty, but a lousy alarm clock","When you want to awaken to a chime, you want to awaken to a chime and not the sound of a loud CLACK as the striker hits the chime and retreats. This sound makes me jump every time. I called customer support, played it for them, and they said the sound is within acceptable parameters. Yeah, maybe for the hearing-impaired. This will be a pretty clock to sit around, but as an alarm clock it's useless. Stupid engineering destroys a decent idea."
1,save your money,"My clock is just over a year old (out of the 1-year warranty). It has an intermittent and annoying load ticking. I contacted Zen and Now the clocks distributor, they said that they do not repair the clocks, but would sell me a new clock for $79.00 plus shipping. I could not bring myself to spend over $200.00 in less than two years for an alarm clock. I then took the clock to local clock repair and because the clock is glued together, they would destroy it if they tried to disassemble. I expected that a clock this expensive to be of better quality. I recommend that you do not toss away your money on this very expensive, cheaply made clock."
2,"Nice concept, but a couple problems...","I bought one of these (mechanical) clocks, because I liked the way they looked and was intrigued with the idea of a nice-sounding progressive alarm. First problem is that the alarm is not really that progressive, as it's still a sharp striking sound and I often woke up on the first strike. The second problem is that it simply doesn't go off reliably. The third problem is that it's got no AM/PM switch, so it's a bit of a task to use it as a daily alarm clock. ...I kept mine because it looked nice--but if you want a nice-sounding alarm clock, an iPod alarm clock playing a home-made audio track is a better choice."
1,title is fine. seller questionable,"the seller repeatedly told me that they had sent the product out either the 21st or 23 rd of dec.it came postmarked the 29th of dec.for free, i might use the seller, otherwise, i'll wait, too frustrating, too much time and at the end, too much BS..."
1,7 minutes missing from tape,"The ""If I Had A Million"" VHS (83 minutes) copy was 7 minutes less than the film's original version of 90 minutes. Missing was 95% of the hilarious W.C.Field's ""Road Hog"" car crash segments. What a disappointment that this copy was made from a local TV station's print which cut the film to allow more commercial time. I'll reorder when a full 90 minute DVD version is available."
5,LET'S HAVE ANOTHER BOOK....PLEASE,"I loved this book ,It just wasn't enough lets have another .Your doing a great job Mr. Cotton."
5,Wonderful - Please Don't Stop,"Great Book, Just like the last three. Excitement and drama. Please don't stop. What happens to the Steel Brothers and Danielle? Mr. Compton could not help but to be smiling down on how you are carrying on his stories and his tradition. Congratulations on another great book."
1,Not Interested,"I found I was not interested in this book. In fact I never finised it. The main problem I had was with the authors use of using each characters full name each time a name was used. No one was ever mentioned by a frist name or just a last name. It was always Danny Duggin` did this, Danny Duggin` did that. Marshal C. F. McCord didthis Marshal C.F.McCord did that. After a while I lost interest in the story line because I was looking to see if the author would change this format. After 80 pages it was time to find another book."
5,The Ill'est Yet,"Ill Bill kills it on his first full length album since Non Phixion split. Chock full of murderous joints sure to make your head nod, along with some tasty LCN jams."
5,"Get to know ""W""","If you still can't believe the first eight years of this century were real, this book will convince you. This book should embarrass everyone who voted for this clown."
4,Always appreciated Molly Ivins' point of view,"I bought this for someone else, but had read it years ago. She was a terrific writer. Molly Ivins and Anne Richards were the best - they will be missed. Their wit was insightful and sharp."
2,Molly Ivins -- Bad Analysis or Just Plain Stupid?,"Ivins -- Terrible Analysis or Just Plain StupidMolly has a folksy down home style. She gets you comfortable with the feeling that she is one of us, and then marches forth with her analysis. Watch out, her numbers are not what they seem and do not back up her words. Example -- Tax Rate -- Molly works through numbers showing that the tax burden on the lowest income groups have the same total tax rate as the highest income groups. She then implies that the two groups are paying the same taxes. However, using her own data, the math actually works out to the richest group paying over 25 times as much per person as the lowest tax group. 25 to 1 is certainly no where the same. Like I said above, I don't know if Molly is a bad analyst, or if she is just plain stupid. At any rate, her conclusions are not borne out by even her facts."
1,Shrub: Yada Yada Yada,"Molly Ivins is the most predictably biased journalist in the business today. She practically foams at the mouth with hatred of any politician who doesn't have a 'D' after his name. This is just one more predictable hatchet job of liberal hate-speech. Molly couldn't find any fault with the... Clinton years, but practically invents and over-blows the slightest Bush 'fault'. Because of her close-minded, lock-step liberal bent, Molly's opinions must be taken with a grain of salt by any open-minded reader. Don't waste your money on this latest example of liberal hate speech."
1,Molly underestimates we Texans again,"Having endured Molly's columns for a number of years, I cannotdecide if she is serious or just takes her positions to make money. She is amusing. Those of us in Texas who voted 65% for him for Governor and those 85+ who approve of his presidency obviously have better vision of the man than she. Imagine ifGore was now president !!!!"
2,Expected something different.,"As a big fan of Molly, I was really looking forward to this book but must say I was disappointed. I thought the book had a lot of interesting observations of Dubya but I couldnt find much of Molly in them. There are enough straight books on G.W's life and times. I think there was too much Lou Dubose and not enough Molly in this one. Come on Molly, eagerly awaiting your next one."
2,Is this about Bush?,"I was looking forward to reading facts about Dubya, but, other than the ""duh"" variety (his father was VP and President of the US, rich people invest money in speculative ventures, it is easier to solicit capital from people you know) they are few and far between. Most of Ivins' and DuBois' material is gossip or speculation and their use of ""*"" is not to provide sources, but to make more catty asides. The chapters beginning on page 57 and 71 have nothing to do with W. I guess they needed to pad the book. I will try to read some more, but my eyes keep glazing over."
2,They came at him from the left!,"I am by know means a big G.W. Bush fan or supporter. But I think the authors let their political views creep into the text. The book does make you look a little closer at the man who might be the next President, so I suppose they accomplished their goal. I would not read this book only and call it quits. But insted use this book as a starting point and go from there."
4,Another Southern Dolt With A Shady Past,"If you don't follow politics, this book will inform you about the person who now sits in the White House. If you voted for him because you believe what the two parties tell you, then you should definitely read this. If you think he's any better of a ""person"" than Clinton, then you NEED to read this.Ivins, with sufficient proof, explains how ""President"" Bush: a) Avoided Vietnam because Daddy rigged it for him b) STILL went AWOL from the Texas Air Nat'l. Guard c) Drank and C-minused his way through Harvard (which Daddy got him into) d) Has never pulled off a successful business venture without the aid of Daddy and Daddy's friends e) Got elected Governor on the basis of Daddy's name, totally without qualificationsAn important, if somewhat dense and bitter, read."
4,Molly Ivins Is Missed!,"There is no other writer that has such a witty presentation on such a difficult subject. She saw George W. Bush and his impact on Texas and with her wonderful sense of humor told the American citizens what to expect with regard to education, guns, laws and leadership. As I read I was amazed at the warnings we had, but we ""elected"" him anyway. Molly said what so many think, but are afraid to say outloud. This book is not heavy or difficult, but explains what GWB did and would do while injecting lots of humor to keep us from crying."
4,Dubya in Texasland and Through the Bidness Glass,"Kudos to Ivins and Dubose for taking a depressing topic and making it witty and entertaining. Not only does Shrub tell you a lot about Dubya, it explains the crazy world of Texas politics. An outspoken progressive,Molly Ivins comes across as surprisingly balanced. Ultimately, the thought of this totally undistinguished, completely corporate controlled man in the White House is enough to make you cry if Ivins and Dubose didn't have you laughing so hard. I'm glad I read Shrub; you will be, too."
4,Not Another One!,"I enjoyed the humorous nuggets in this book, and it confirmed my suspicion that ""Dubya"" is in many ways the Christian Right's best form of flattering William Jefferson Clinton through imitation.I have found more Ivins in earlier books and more humor in Ivins. She is wickedly funny on her own; she and her co-author are droll in this book. Perhaps they were impaired by their having to kid on the square.The question this book raised for me was whether, by April or May, we shall have two scions and Clinton wannabes, one Democrat and one Republican, shucking and triangulating past substance and ideas to the politicking of naked ambition and content-free communication.I endorse this book as a means [simple observation would be another means and cheaper] by which to see just how empty one of the two major vessels will be. I await the book that covers Shrub's opponent, Blood Drop."
1,An Insect Attackes A Bush,"What else would you expect? Another book on a GOP personality written by a Democratic Party Activists and third-rate failed journalist, small-time Party hatchetman Lou Dubose. And guess what? He doesn't like Bush. Surprize. Credits him with nothing. Surprize. Ridicules his accomplishments, Surprize. Belittles his drive and personality. Surprize.Don't waste you money on this one, even the half-truths are incoherant. No doubt you already know how you feel about Bush, and probably have a better basis for that opinion than this tuna boat.Bottom line: For the extent that the author dislikes Bush, he really can't find much to soil him with, though try as he did. An incompetant slander at best. Don't bother."
1,Typical Ivins,"I read most of the book and was not impressed -- not because I am a big fan of any politician but I am so tired to bashing the ""winner"" no matter who he/she may be. I think this is one of the big problems in the US today. If you can't beat them fairly then bash them to death. But then what can we expect after seven plus years of the current administration. If you can't beat them -- make fun of them and maybe they will go away."
3,"Good exploration of GW Bush, but not vintage Ivins","When I saw Molly Ivins, one of my favorite political writers, had written a book about George W. Bush, one of my least favorite politicians, I was quite happy. I was truly looking forward to her devastating Bush with her vicious political wit.Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The book's revelations on Bush are as harsh as I had hoped, but it lacks the wonderful wit Ivins' showed in her earlier books.To be honest, I suspect the work was largely Lou Dubose's with Molly Ivins' name attached.In short, if you want a good book that exposes GW, read this book. But don't read it if you want vintage Molly Ivins."
4,Everyone Should Read This,"If you've ever shaken your head wondering about some of the things that George Bush says and does, this book will help you understand more about him. Forget about everything and everyone except for big business and you'll understand very quickly where he's coming from."
5,Oh My!,George W. is a piece of work. I live in Texas and I've always suspected that a wade in the waters of his soul would scarcely get your feet wet. This book proves it. Kudos to Miss Molly for a dead on examination of the man who would be President!
5,If Only More People Had Read this LAST YEAR,"As someone who cares about the environment, I would never vote for a republican. But if we have to have one for president, why this guy? I read both this book and ""Is Our Children Learning"" and they share the same problem: they dilute their journalistic findings with sophomoric humor. I think both of these books should now be required reading for all Americans, so we can have a little better insight into the new leader of the free world. However, I think that if someone could have written in a style that sounded more journalistic and less sarcastic, these discussions of Bush/Shrub/dublya's record might have reached a wider audience and thus had the impact on the electoral process they deserve. I ask myself everyday, what does Bush's victory over first John McCain (a real American hero with real Washington experience) and then Gore say about American's priorities?"
1,Horrible amateurish drawings,I can't believe how bad the drawings are in this book. Awkward bodies and faces that look like they came from a high school kids figure drawing class. These guys worked in comics? Incredible.Don't expect much instruction and you DO NOT want to practice your skills by looking at the junk in this book. The bodies are oddly distorted and faces unattractive and unbalanced. Just bad bad stuff.Avoid this book like the plague.
3,Out dated.,"This book is rather outdated. Some of the information is ok, but I wasn't impressed by the quality of drawing and while I realize comics lean to the fantastic, in some anatomical areas, no attempt was made to even approximate reality."
1,dissapointed,Upon ordering this product I was under the impression that a popular site such as amazon.com would be professional with their presentation and delivery procedures. I received the watch in a plastic wrapper and an elastic band.. I find this unacceptable because after spending over $200 I expect atleast a box or a package with the instructions and warranty booklet none of which I received; thus causing me to question its authenticity. What made it worse this was a gift for my brohter so I was not able to return it. And even if I did have the opportunity to return it I still would'nt know what to do because their was their was no instruction of their return policy.
2,Get a different book,"While this book is reasonably well-organized and has some interesting tidbits, there's nothing particularly insightful or original about the advice contained in it. (Make sure it goes well with your last name, think twice about a very popular name or one that's hard to spell, etc. etc.) The author also discusses her own name so often that it gets boring, and misspells the names of several celebrities, which might be acceptable anywhere but in a book where the names are the whole point!There's a multitude of baby name books out there; pick a better one."
5,What a fantastic and original resource,I loved this book. So many guides out there are just lists and lists of names. Ms. Weiss did a terrific job of organizing the book into fun and different categories that made it so easy for us to choose a name for our first-born. Don't buy any other book. Just this one!!
5,smooth and smoking,"Buddy Guy is THE definiition of the blues. This album is a collection of the Chess recording years and is one of those albums i can put on and let run straight through. The first song on the album ""Worried Mind"" is a great lesson in ""less is more"" guitar soloing. ""I found a true love is buttery smooth and ""leave my little girl alone"" is a blues classic. If your not convinced that this is a great album just remember that Stevie Ray Vaughn and Eric Clapton considered Buddy one of their biggest influences."
5,Excellent,"A very ""cute"" and funny ornament that is one of the collectibles from Hallmark. An excellent addition to any collection of tree ornaments."
3,Moods & Chants,"I rather enjoyed listening to this CD. I didn't like any song really well, but they were fun in general. These are the fun kind of chants that actually sound like music, so I liked it.I actually got what seems like the German release,Geisterwuste (Ghost Desert): Musical Impressions and Songs of Original Africa, there's no difference, but it's less expensive. Definitely worth it.A good set of African music!"
1,terrible,"I bought this as a corset but I received just a top. I'm not saying the thingie is not nice, it fits and I agree with previous review. But pls do take into account that it is not a corset. If you need some nice top for special occasion, it can work for u..."
2,"Basic Information No ""real"" examples","This books provides simple outline to various tools. It lacks the depth and content about the various tools. There are NO examples that you can use or follow. Pictures are hard to read so following the step-by-step instructions are not very easy. It does provide a very gereral overview of using the dynamic features of dreamweaver. I would recommend this book ONLY as a general guide, not as a tool to learn anything in depth."
2,If you are looking for a picture book...,"If you are looking for a picture book that points and shows you what all the menus do then maybe you will like this book. This book is very basic and does not go into detail on any of the menus and functions in Dreamweaver. This book also is more pictures (blurry, hard to read) then text. I found very little that was helpful and the rest I felt was a waste of time to read. I am the type that needs detailed explanations on how to use the different options in Dreamweaver and this book does NOT offer that."
3,"Helpful... but the ""companion web site"" is not there!!!","I found this to be a quick intro to Dreamweaver MX (I already did the tutorial for an earlier version) and it was helpful... but it is really just an overview. Also, the ""companion web site"" that is supposed to have code examples is no longer there!!!I was able to get this at Fry's for $20 with a $20 mail-in rebate... that price probably explains why the on-line info is not available. :("
5,Just Ask Martha,"I love this book! As a recent transplant to Pasadena, this has become an indespensible resource for finding everything from a late-night dry cleaner to the best coffee shops to where to tune your radio station to NPR. The maps are very user-friendly and make finding your way around town a snap! I keep one in my car at all times. I wish every town had such a practical guide. Now whenever I have a question, ""I just ask Martha."" It's almost as good as having her in the passenger seat. Thank you Martha! This book is a life-saver."
1,Richard Montauk: the stereotypical arrogant lawyer.,"Don't buy this book. Many of the example essays are hilariously bad. I especially enjoyed the one by the caretaker of a disabled woman who ""is the only person standing between her and a nursing home."" Yeah, and now she'll be in a nursing home while you pursue a law degree. Good job, there!I'm convinced that half the 5-star reviews here were written by Montauk himself. I have been through the law school admissions process. The advice in this book is generic at best. Save your money."
2,Not the best,"Save your money. There are plenty of other books that are far superior to this one. Examples: Law School Confidential, The Complete Law School Companion, How to Succeed in Law School.This read is not worth it. Seriously."
1,Helpful for a select few,"Don't let this book scare you away from going to law school. Montauk suggests a JD will only be helpful for a career in law, yet he is now a consultant. If someone has Richard Montauk's address, let me know. I'd like to send him back this book."
5,Indispensable,"I've bought at least half a dozen books on law school, and this one stands head and shoulders above the others on the topic of admissions. It gives you very specific information about how to get someone to write you the best possible letter of recommendation, what your best essay options are, what to do if you're waitlisted, and so on. No book is packed with more or better information than this one, and it's useful regardless of the caliber of the schools you're applying to. Buying this book is your first step in taking the legal profession by storm."
5,Highly recommended...,"Montauk is blunt and opinionated, but his honesty is part of what makes this book so useful. It answered almost all the important questions I had about the law school application process, and helped me put together a very successful application. Every chapter is sprinkled with quotes from the deans of admissions at almost all of the top sixteen or so law schools. It was nice to get their perspective, which generally seemed to validate Montauk's approach.One caveat: As the title implies, ""How to Get Into the Top Law Schools"" was written for people who are applying to elite programs, so anybody who is looking outside the top twenty or so might not find Montauk's attitude or advice quite as helpful. Nevertheless, I can't imagine a better resource for anybody aiming for the top."
4,best for people who are still deciding whether to apply,"This book certainly has some helpful information, but the author spends a good bit of time trying to help the reader make sure that he/she wants to go to law school and wants to be a laywer. He does some motive-chekcing (Why do want to go to LS? Are you sure you're doing it for the right reasons? etc). This may prove helpful for those who are still unsure, but not for those who have already thought through these questions.However, the book has good info. on writing a personal statement; that's the part that I found to be the most helpful. Some of the other info. (about the LSAT, etc) you can find on the LSAC website or through LSAT study guides that you might end up buying anyway (such as the Analytical and Logical Reasoning Bible--GREAT books).I think the section of the personal statement is what made this book worth the purchase."
2,Good for those only a select few,"I bought this book and found myself saying ""and this pertains to me how?"" First off, much of the information provided in this book can be pick-up at a law school forum, secondly the advice is worthless to those not looking at the so-called ""top 15 schools"" (Ivy's, Cal, UVA, Duke, etc). In fact, the question posed in the title can be summed up in 3 words - high LSAT score. For the schools referenced in this book you need a LSAT in the 160-164 range to even get on the wait list. Not to mention that the personal statements are from people with extraordinary backgrounds - people who lived in the jungles of Costa Rica, grew up dirt poor, got pregnent at age 14 or had klansmen in their front yard. Doesn't really help the suburban kid who has lived a normal life. Save your money for the application fees, go to a law school forum, study hard for the LSAT and ignore law school rankings."
4,pretty good,"This book is pretty comprehensive; it answers most of the questions that I had about applying to law school. Especially useful are the sample essays, which include comments about what each essay's strengths and weaknesses are."
1,Diffuser,"I bought this item because it says it is one size fits all. I travel alot and do not want to carry by big heavy hair dryer with me, especially since most lodging overseas provide hair dryers. This adaptor did not fit any of them--even my own dryer."
4,A story of courage and survival,"After reading ""Daddy was a bad boy"" I could only marvel at the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity as portrayed by the author. I also grew up during the depression so I know what it's like to be unsure of the next meal. Although frequently out of work during the mid thirties, my daddy was loyal to his family and never strayed. I can only imagine the anxiety and insecurity of a young child denied the reassurance of a father during times of stress. I can relate to Floriana's book since my mother survived a similiar situation with aphysically abusive father who was derelict in his paternal duties. Just like Floriana, my mother rose above her early hardships and disappointments and lived a useful, productive and happy life.I admire the courage it took to write such a book.I recommend this book to anyone who harbors resentments for past injustices. It will help them accept the past and move on ---- CAJ"
4,not for paper,"i actually bought this glue for an extra strong hold for paper to paper and it didn't stick at all. although on the description it did not say it would stick to paper, it didn't say it wouldn't either :o/ i haven't tried it on any other material in which i'm sure it does what it says, but if you're looking for a glue for paper go with crazy or super glue ;o)"
5,"Good for Class, Good for Marketing",Had to read this book for a promotions class. A great deal of information and incite especially looking at todays markets. Takes away the notion of the 4 P's and brings in the idea of SIVA.
4,Great Illustrations,My daughter absolutely loves the illustrations in this book. She thinks the pictures are so silly. Mem Fox is making you guess throughout the book about a crazy old lady and this makes it a very fun book to read. We got it from the library and now we must purchase it!
5,Guess what,This is a fabulous predictive text story and has been one of my favourites for years. The illustrations by Vivienne Goodman are brilliant. Love the book!!
3,Great Book - high cost.,This is a good book but not worth it's price. The primary reason to buy it is if your professor requires it. If you can find it used or an old edition great. Otherwise head to your local library. It does provide a lot of useful information and ideas on literature choices for young readers.
2,never lives up to the billing,"I read the book because the title is very captivating. I'm a fan of Ramsey Campbell but this book is disappointing. Christopher Kelly(the killer) is an interesting character, but the ending is very anti-climactic--not what I would have expected from Campbell. His other books I've read are better: The Nameless and The Face that Must Die. I'll continue to be a fan and read some of his other novels. But for his debut novel--this one crashed."
2,"Great concept, crappy velcro","I have a love/hate relationship with these blankets. They work great at first, but I just find that the velcro wears out waaaaaay too fast. It's frustrating when my LO starts breaking out of them all the time. I had one of these in the smaller size and I thought it was getting too small for my baby, but after having this one, I really think it was just that the velcro didn't work anymore because I am having the same issue and this one is definitely not too small."
4,Nice swaddle wraps,"These swaddle wraps are awesome. Easy to use, baby stays wrapped up tight all night lOng. I had the smaller ones and had to size up."
2,Only used it 10 days before it got a hole,"We bought two of these...this particular one in cottonSummer Infant SwaddleMe Cotton Knit - Graphic Jungleand one in the fleece fabricSummer Infant SwaddleMe Microfleece, Green, Large. We used the cotton one for 10 nights, and our son managed to kick his way through the material at the bottom. It's too bad, because the cotton SwaddleMe is nice for warmer nights...but I won't buy another one. Not worth the money.We are still using the fleece one, and he hasn't found any weaknesses in the fabric...I am hoping it stays together a bit longer than the cotton one!"
5,Really Helps Baby Sleep!,"We are using this swaddler with our second child, after having great results with our first. We wore out the ones we had with our daugther from sheer overuse! And we hated to put our little boy in a pink one, so time for a new one or two! Great product! helps baby feel secure and rest better in the early months"
1,Wasn't what it says it is,"The item I ordered was a large swaddleme sleep sack. However, I was sent a large swaddleme wrap. (The kind with the velcro wings to really swaddle a baby)The description on Amazon and the actual product are two very different things!"
2,Not a good one for Dean,The beginning of this book was very slow - and I was only able to finish it by putting it down for a couple of weeks. It got to be ok by Christmas time - but didn't heat up till the last 1/3 or 1/4 of the book. A lot of time was spent trying to weave a bunch of lives and people together but it just dragged it all. The ending was very disappointing - and the meaning behind the title was made clear on the second last page - not a very good reason or title.I loved Odd Thomas and Life Expectancy but this one was not a Dean Koontz book that I would recommend or read again
2,What a crappy ending!,I read this book for a report and I could've read a better book that was * a lot * shorter. I enjoyed it up the **awful** ending. Read another book with a ***good*** ending. Jeez!
2,An ambitious disapointment,"I'm not going to talk about the plot. I really like Dean Koontz. Sole Survivor and Phantoms are among my favorites. I was excited to dig into this one, but was soon disappointed when I discover that half the characters are pointless, the big revelation is a let down and a cop out especially for Koontz. The final two chapters were pretty suspenceful though, and for a decent ending I give it 2 stars, but everything else is boring, for a book that is nearly 700 pages long not a whole lot happens."
4,"very good, but....","I thought that this was a good book. I enjoyed reading a lot, I mean I spent all weekend doing nothing but reading it. However it seems a little drawn out when it didn't need to be. In the beginning of the book, it seemed all about fear. Most of the characters were experiencing problems with fear. Then towards the end, it lost that and didn't really go into why. You may guess the reason, but it was a little unclear. Also, it seemed to end a little early. (If that's possible with 600+ pages.) A little too rushed at the end. This is only my 2nd Koontz book and I did enjoy it immensely, don't get me wrong, but it seemed a lot like (in a general sense) the 1st Koontz book I read, One Door Away From Heaven. Save the world with the help of ETs and a few pyschos thrown in. Oh well, they were both really good."
2,Strangers,"I am big mystery/suspense reader and Strangers does not rank up there with any of my favorites. This book, to put it simply was just okay!The version a that I read was 526 pages long and I found that to be entirely too long (how others read versinons between 800 and six-hundred-and-some pages and still gave this book five stars I don't know)! The story could have been told very well in about 400 pages and would have gotten a much better review from me, however, I felt that much of the 526 pages was just fluff that unnecessarily filled up space. My other problem with this book was the ending which was totally predictable (let me just say, without giving away the ending, what you think it is, it is).Strangers was not a horrible book but I expected so much more from it as well as from Koontz which is why I can only give it 2 1/2 stars (there is no 1/2 option so I can really only give it 2)."
3,Okay,"I don't think Dean Koontz is a very good writer. But Strangers is pretty good. Some parts were very intiguing, other parts were very boring. I guessed what happened to the Strangers about a third of the way through."
3,above average,"This is a good book, it also happens to be my first Koontz. It is well written in Koontz' customary style. The problems I have with it is that it is too long, 4/5ths would've been more than enough. 2ndly, following the simply awesome first half, I figured out the rest and also didn't feel it was on par with the first half (sort of like the new Mercedes E-class). Regardless, it's a good read if only for the first half - I found myself laughing out loud at times. The first half gets 5 stars from me. It could also have been made into a movie that would better many and most movies on this subject that are out there."
4,"This is a definite page-turner, except...","Out of all Dean Koontz's books (and I have read them all, I think), I had the most mixed feelings about this one. The story's great, the plot's great, and the the characters are...great, except for Ginger Weiss. She was nauseating. So nauseating, in fact, that I could only take her in small doses(which is why it took me a MONTH to read the whole book; pretty bad, huh?). Anyway, she's the only reason I didn't give this book a 10, otherwise, it's an awesome read!"
3,"Long, but worth reading","I've agreed with most all the other reviews on this book. It is good, but it is long. It's not scary, but interesting. It keeps you turning the pages if for no other reason than to find out when it's going to get moving.The last thirty pages are the best of the 688 pages. It took me six days to complete this book, but I had to set it down now an then to rest from some boredom.Maybe to many characters is why this book was so long? In Koontz afterthought he mentions the editor wanted him to shorten up the story...he should have. In any case I enjoyed reading this book."
3,Long Book But Adds Up,Though it's 600 pages it is a reasonably good book. It's in 3 parts and doesn't really get moving untill the ending of part 2. Eventually it all adds up making the ending better than this classic ending.
5,Most memorable book of his,"I have read many other Horror novels by different authors but Dean Koontz stands out far ahead simply through this novel. The characters become real people in your mind and whats happening to them a real unexplainable horror. The ending to this book was excellent and to me quite surprising. Other novels of his that have equalled this books standard are Watchers, Cold Fire and the Christopher Snow books, keep an eye out for them Readers new to Dean Koontz for in my view there some of his best works. Anyone who enjoys books about characters who become involved in bizarre and strange events or deep and involved plots and conspiracies will enjoy a lot of Dean Koontz's novels. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."
2,"Good suspense, lousy climax","This book started out great - lots of suspense, and it was very interesting the way what seemed like various little vingettes melded into one story. The ending, however, or what should have been the 'climax' was disappointing. I don't read much Koontz, and this one isn't the one to make me want to read more."
4,"Strangers, by Dean Koontz","Strangers, by Dean Koontz. Interesting first contact concept. I felt I knew all of the main characters as I was reading the book."
4,Good book!,"I liked this book very much. It grabbed my interest at the start. Kept me reading to find out how everything ties in. The only thing I was a little disappointed about was how the ending slowed down. But, in spite of that, I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
3,Meh,"The story line is good, the book itself is slow. Lots of switching back and forth between characters before they all meet. I can usually read a Koontz or King novel in 3 days or less, I'm working on over 2 weeks with this book and the only reason I haven't just given up all together is because I've put forth too much effort reading it so far to give up now. Meh."
2,Strangers,I am still learning this. I would change the stars to fiveIt was hard to put the book aside. I have always enjoyed reading his books
4,Classic Koontz,"This is more of a mystery than a horror novel, though it does have its creepy moments. Very good, though. It would probably make a good movie."
4,Strangers,"I really liked it. Not my favorite Dean Koontz, but it's one that kept me interested and anxious to find out what the common thread these Strangers have. The book makes you think you know the ending, then you may doubt yourself. Even though I figured out the ending, it was a little weak when it came to the opposition. I loved the characters (strangers)! Some humor. Thoroughly enjoyed the book and I had to stop myself a few times, from sneaking ahead to look at the ending. (I'm glad I didn't)"
4,One of Koontz' best,"I read this book shortly after it came out (1986) and loved it. My husband and I are both avid readers and fans of Dean Koontz; recently I asked my husband if he had read ""Strangers"" and he said no, he'd never heard of it before, so I went to some book stores and couldn't find it. Finally I went to Amazon and ordered it from there; I am thoroughly enjoying reading it for the second time and I know my husband will enjoy it as son as I am finished with it."
3,Strangers from Dean Koontz,"I am a fan of mr. Koontz and always rejoice at a great read from my favorite author. I must say that this book is way too long and there are way too many principal characters with too many developping story. I thought there were two hundred pages we could have done without. Overall a very well-kept enigma, a classic Koontz read."
2,ok if you like sci-fi,"Strangers was well written, but not my type of story... it is a sci fi novel, which I didn't know when I picked it up."
1,Shameful waste of paper,"I'm astonished that anyone can give this book higher than one or maybe two stars. My copy is 681 pages, so you might think there's a whale of a story here, right? You'd be way wrong.Koontz must have the best agent in the biz to be able to get this garbage to the market. After 50 pages I started skimming. At 97 pages I gave it up, and just briefly skimmed ahead to the end. Koontz has a serious love affair going on with his own writing, and never mind the story. This is not the first one of his books that I've gotten thoroughly disgusted with because of his verbosity. Sad to say, tho, this may very well be my last Koontz book. He's definitely talented, and has a highly creative imagination. I've wondered before tho, and again with this book; does he get paid by the word?Fortunately, I got this free from a friend. Save your money. Do not buy it. You've been warned."
2,Another bad ending,"I'm not sure how so many reviewers give this a 5 star rating! The book was ""OK"" until the ending, and that ending just ruined everything. It was almost as bad as the ending on ""From the Corner of His Eye"". I am now weary on buying any more books from Koontz."
1,Beyond Boring,"I had heard great things about Koontz's books so I thought I'd give one a try. It was an agonizing experience. Perhaps if it had been edited from 670 to maybe 300 or so it might have been tolerable but it just went on and on an on in the most boring fashion. I read a lot, at least one novel a week, and I love thrillers. The only thing thrilling about this was reaching the end. God, I hated this book."
3,e-book review.,"As far as the novel goes, I can only repeat what others have already said. The novel itself rates 4-5 stars.But I want to address the e-book itself. Apparently, someone had to type this book into electronic format. There are numerous errors throughout the book - from misspelled words to missing text. If there was any proof reading, it must have been someone who had no more command of the English language than the typist (middle-eastern?). I would rate their work as a D or passing for the novel itself. The Afterword is another matter. I rate that as an F-. Misspelling, words and text missing - you really have to decipher what is there.If it doesn't improve, I will forget the e-book and go with the printed copy."
2,Strangers,"I am big mystery/suspense reader and Strangers does not rank up there with any of my favorites. This book, to put it simply was just okay! The version a that I read was 526 pages long and I found that to be entirely too long (how others read versinons between 800 and six-hundred-and-some pages and still gave this book five stars I don't know)! The story could have been told very well in about 400 pages and would have gotten a much better review from me, however, I felt that much of the 526 pages was just fluff to fill up space.My other problem with this book was the ending which was totally predictable (let me just say, without giving away the ending, what you think it is, it is). Strangers was not a horrible book but I expected so much more from it as well as from Koontz which is why I can only give it 2 1/2 stars (there is no 1/2 option so I can really only give it 2:))."
5,Incredible page turner.,This is one of the most compelling and suspenseful books Koontz has ever written. I was so enthralled I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. Several strangers find themselves experiencing bizarre repressed memories that eventually draw them to a small desert town and a small cafe where something supernatural happened to them... Brilliantly plotted and incredibly suspenseful. You won't be able to put this book down until it's harrowing climax.
5,People can be so diverse,"People can be so diverse;for example,look at some of our more noted trials of late.Most of us see them guilty,while some see different.How else can such opposite reviews of the same book be possible?!i think lots of you looked at this book differently than i did.I see the wonderful things we share as human beings as the main course of this story;which by the way,could not possibly be cut one page.I think Ginger says it best No more would people be strangers,one to another,not anywhere.I felt so good when all these strangers and and their friends come together with love,redemption hope and compassion.Plus the spirit of our higher power was there as well.Anyway;this is one of my favorite books of all time."
5,My favorite Dean Koontz book!,"This was the first Dean Koontz book I ever read, and it is still my favorite. Each character is engaging and unique, and the story quickly pulls you in. Definitely a book that is hard to put down once you start reading."
2,Strangers,"This book was not one of Dean Koontz better books. There was way to much beating around the bush about an ending that anyone can see coming a mile away. The characters are the usual Dean Koontz characters. The good guys are all good and the bad guys are all bad. No middle ground. Usually the best part of a Dean Koontz novel is his narration from the bad guys perspective, which this book somewhat lacks. I wouldn't recommend this book."
3,Slow to start,"Book is long and slow through first half. The latter half is more interesting as the suspense builds and you begin to understand the dynamics between the characters and become curious about the ultimate ending (why the moon?). The ending is somewhat of a letdown because the book builds up event in July to such a degree, comparing it to the greatest event of mankind (a.k.a. the meaning of life, Jesus, etc.). I was hoping for a more climatic ending that answered all the questions that were asked throughout the book. That said, it's an interesting read and I'd recommend."
1,NO WAY!,I've read other books by Koontz and this has been a big disappointment! The beginning just dragged and I found myself skipping sections by the time I reached the last new character. The middle was okay at best. The ending left me feeling cheated. The characters get through their fear issues and find out the secret buried in their memories. Something unsurprising happens. It gets resolved in less than 3 minutes. Then the characters talk about the secret for awhile. THE END.This book was lame. Definitely one to miss.
3,Strangers by Dean Koontz,The book was too wordy and too slow! It was interesting but the ending was more in the line of a romance novel.I don't think it came up to phantoms or The Key to December
3,Not bad,"This book was an all right read. Character development was great, as you really got to know, like, and empathize with the people in the story. The only thing I didn't like about the book was they way it ended, for 680 pages the story builds, the characters build you begin to expect something great and then its just over. The overall plot ending is fine, but all of a sudden you are left with a bunch of characters that have established relationships with each other and then its over. When I was finished I felt very unfulfilled and kind of was asking myself ""what's the point?"""
3,Pretty bad Dean Koontz,In my opinion this is one of Koontz worst. I wasnt expecting a sci-fi ending so I was very disappointed. In my opinion you read this long book and think its something important and then you find this unbelievable reason out. Its just a long book with a bad ending. I will continue to read Koontz however.
2,Strangers,"I am big mystery/suspense reader and Strangers does not rank up there with any of my favorites. This book, to put it simply was just okay! The version a that I read was 526 pages long and I found that to be entirely too long (how others read versinons between 800 and six-hundred-and-some pages and still gave this book five stars I don't know)! The story could have been told very well in about 400 pages and would have gotten a much better review from me, however, I felt that much of the 526 pages was just fluff that unnecessarily filled up space. My other problem with this book was the ending which was totally predictable (let me just say, without giving away the ending, what you think it is, it is). Strangers was not a horrible book but I expected so much more from it as well as from Koontz which is why I can only give it 2 1/2 stars (there is no 1/2 option so I can really only give it 2)."
5,FEELS LIKE HOTEL CALIFORNIA!,Feels like Hotel California because they are there of their own device!You will find out what that is soon because the book is to hard to put down!You will not forget these people or the motel.I felt like I was there and didn't want to leave by the time I finished the book. Please read ! one of his best YOU WILL LAUGH AND GET SCARED AT THE SAME TIME!
2,Way too long. Don't waste your time reading this 681 flop.,"I agree with Dave from Arlington, TX. I read at least 250-300 pages before the book started to make any sense. The cover claims that it is a ""spellbinding story."" Yeah, right. I plodded through to the foolish ending. Don't waste you time. Stephen King said that this was ""...the best book he has written so far..."" Then again, Stephen King wrote Tommyknockers. If you thought Tommyknockers was way too long and had a stupid ending wait until you read Strangers."
3,Just watch History Channel,"It did not take me long at all to get into this story. I spent a good little while being honestly spooked by the story Koontz had created. The details he gave about the strange experiences of the characters were vivid, and there were many times I had to check behind me in the darkness to be sure I wasn't experiencing anything strange myself. The characters were perfectly laid out and well-rounded, and until the last bit of the book I was loving the entire story. Unfortunately, the story became predictable..believe me, I skipped many pages of details and did not miss anything, I wasn't lost in any way. It was extremely disappointing once the reason for the strange experiences is revealed, though it can be predicted down to the smallest detail before Koontz even reveals all clues. From the experiences, I had thought it would be much more supernatural than what it was..I could see this on History Channel anyday."
4,Excellent book but very long to get into it,"This was one of the first books that I read by Koontz and I must say it was pretty darn good. I picked this book up however, and it took me over 3 months to finish it because I kept losing interest in it. But I must say, after you get through the boring parts, especially about the priest Brendan Cronin, it will pick up and be quite suspensefull. I would recommend Whispers or Strange Highways as a book to start with if you are new to the author however, if you enjoy most other books by Koontz and can put up with the slow and sometimes agravating beginning you will be rewarded with and excellent story that you wish didn't end as soon as it seems."
3,"Good Story ""at the end""","I have read many Koontz books, I hope to read all his work like I've done with King. This story, like many of Koontz's stories is very wordy. Sometimes I feel like Koontz is trying to dazzle you with his immense vocabulary. The introduction of characters was about half the book (there are alot of characters in this story, and all are very likable)but once all the characters are introduced and the story starts to come together, fasten your seatbelt because the action is furious and entertaining. Like most stories, there are characters you like better than others, I found Ginger and Dom very likable. All-in-All this is a good story, just like most of Koontz's books"
4,Strangers,"Koontz never disappoints! Fast paced ,suspenseful with complex characters . Set aside some time for this one, it's hard to walk away from!"
2,I thought this would never end....,"Now I normally don't mind long books if they are of the ""can't put it down"" variety. And I have read other reviews that complained about ""Strangers"" length. But I really couldn't wait for this thing to end. I nearly quit several times but hung in there to the end. I'm a Koontz fan but this story just drug on too far and involved too many principles in my opinion."
4,One of Wumpscut's better releases,"I have listened to most of Wumpscut's releases, and this one stands out the most in my opinion. On the older albums, there were only one or two great tracks I liked...not enough to really warrant a purchase. The overall sound of Wreath Of Barbs seems more organized and musical with less banging, screaming, and filler material. Even with this change however, Wumpscut has not diluted into synthpop like so many other industrial bands. The theme of Wreath Of Barbs is still as dark and angry as the previous albums. Deliverance and Wreath Of Barbs are the best tracks on here, and shouldn't disappoint any Wumpscut fan. So for long time Wumpscut fans: Yes, the sound has changed a little but it's still worth picking up. For those who have not liked Wumpscut in the past: Wreath Of Barbs is just different enough to deserve another listen. Either way, Wreath Of Barbs fits nicely into any industrial fan's collection."
2,this album blows,"the vocals are hella cool but the lyrics are g.ay, and i the layering could have been better. I kinda like this band but i think this album could have been alot more then it was.oh well what do i know, i am not doing what their doing, im siting on a computer crying about it, oh well whatever their lucky but i still hate this album, but its still semi ok but just not for me, it make me yawn"
1,VERY UPSET,"IT IS NOT HANS CHRISTAIN ANDERSON'S FAIRY TALES, it is Brothers Grim compiled with some of HANS CHRISTAIN ANDERSON'S TALES, NOT EVEN THE SAME COVER, VERY UPSET, wanted my son to read the true HANS CHRISTAIN ANDERSON FAIRY TALES. Hate the Brothers Grim, hate that they twisted the three writer's together in this book. NOT HAPPY WITH IT NOT BEING WHAT WAS DETAILED IN THE ORDER. NOT HAPPY AT ALL."
4,They are all here,"Well, all of Andersen's tales are in this book. It was an education for me to read it. His tales are so different than the Brothers Grimm. You won't find tons of witches and magic and ""traditional"" fairy tales in this book. Anderrsen's tales are moral in tone -- I think he wrote them to teach Christian lessons. Some of them are preachy.I'm a Believer but I prefer the fantastic kinds of fairy tales."
4,Love it!!,"Better than microwave popcorn, I used to get this in stores but now have to order online. A little pricey, but delicious!!"
4,"Good, but not quite theater quality or taste.","I love the all in one packs, they are so easy to use, no measuring. The smell and taste aren't bang on, however we have some food sensitivities in our household and these all in ones were the only ones I could find without Tartrazine (Yellow #5)which happens to be a known migraine trigger. So no Flavorcol for us (Boo!)"
5,"Yum, yum....yummy!","I think it is better than movie theater popcorn, perfect combination of seasoning and butter flavor. I first purchased it from Bed, Bath and Beyond and was looking for more...I found it here on Amazon."
3,Whole lotta popcorn going on,"This product is a _lot_ of popcorn. I didn't realize just how much till it showed up. And it is very good popcorn but if you use the full seasoning/butter-like-substance packet it is really not popcorn you want to eat on a very regular basis because your sodium and cholesterol levels will go through the roof! If you don't care about the health impact, I wholeheartedly endorse it."
2,Beware of price vs size,"I ordered Wabash Vally Farms popcorn from popcornpopper dot com. As you see here on Amazon, they do not state that their pouches have 4oz of popcorn. A rip-off for the price. Great Northern Popcorn is as good if not better and has 8oz for the same price. I won't buy Wabash Vally Farms again."
5,"Simple, delicious and easy to make.","This popcorn is as close to the movies as you can get in your own living room. It's simple and easy to make. Plus, it smells divine when popping too."
2,Waxy taste,"I was not fully satisfied with this product, the popcorn (once popped) was a little rubbery and waxy, not crunchy as you would expect."
2,"No ""movie theater taste "" here!","While I agree with the other reviews in the respect that it taste better than microwave, it doesn't begin to come close to actually theater popcorn. It still lacked that buttery, sweet/salty taste found in theater popcorn. If a duplicate of theater corn is what your are seeking, KEEP SEARCHING. YOU WON'T FIND IT IN THIS BRAND!"
5,Great Popcorn,"I've been using this popcorn for years and it's the best on the market. No artificial butter but the real deal and if you want butter, you can melt your own. I recommend this especially if you're using a whirey Pop Stovetop popper."
5,The best there is!,This is as close to that real theatre popcorn taste as I've ever found--it is just delicious. It works perfectly with the Whirley Pop popper on the stovetop.I have to avoid buying it too often or I'm afraid I'll OD on popcorn---it never seems to last long in the pantry!
5,YUMMY!,"TASTES A LOT LIKE MOVIE THEATER POPCORN, CLOSEST I HAVE EVER TRIED. WILL DEF BUY AGAIN AND AGAIN!"
5,Perfect Popcorn Everytime,"I love this pre-measured, pre-packaged popcorn. When I make it in my Whirley Pop Popcorn Popper it turns out perfect every time. I had to laugh when my 7 year old nephew told me that my popcorn tastes better than the movie theaters! I am not so sure about that but it is true to its name - it does taste like freshly popped theater popcorn."
4,Wow! A nice addition to Stuart's collection!,"I was plesantly surprised w/ Michael Stuart's new cd. It is more salsarific than teh others. That is what I think. The songs, Casi Perfecta, Inexplicable, Yo te quiero dulce, and others are really fun salsa songs. I have his other cd, Retratos, and this one has more danceable tunes. It is a good cd, and I would recommend you checking it out, it is more faster and as I say danceable. Some of the songs I was not happy with at first. Subele el volumen sounds kind of elementary, I don't know why, maybe it will just take time to get used to it. That is what usually happens. I recommend you buying this cd, it is probably the best of Michael Stuart."
1,His style is not my style,"Although the arrangements are good, Michael's voice is just too shrilly for my liking. I really, really tried to look out for what everyone else is raving about but I'm sorry I just didn't hear it."
2,Gems of Chinese Poetry,"tTE TRANSLATIONS ARE POOR, MEANING OFTEN SACRIFICED FOR RHYME, BUT GEMS AND mORE Gems comprise an interesting selection of Tang poetrySunflower Splendor: Three Thousand Years of Chinese Poetry (Midland Book)"
1,"Talking Heads, Yes - Tornados, No","I want my money back. 80% talking heads and close ups of the chasers' faces from the back seat of the car and only 20% of storm shots. And the Shouting, Dictatorial Reed was annoying. Instead causing the viewer to ""feel the moment"" during in the exciting and dangerous moments of chasing, it is very, very annoying. Shut up! And the condescending volley of orders...! ""Do this! Do that! Get the blankity-blank gas if you want."" I finally turned the volume off, fast-forwarded to the few storm scenes offered and have just finished throwing this dvd in the trash. Useless!"
2,Disappointed!!!,"If the show has Reed Timmer & Joel Taylor in it, you are sure going to expect an action packed show. Unfortunately, Tornado Glory falls very short of thrilling TV. Save your money & watch the TV series ""Storm Chasers"". You will get much more out of watching the series than this cheap attempt of a DVD."
2,Nothing special,I'm gonna quote toby keith and say this movie need a little less talk and alot more action.
5,You won't go back to canned!,"The Starkist Tuna in oil in the pouch is far superior to canned tune! No fussy, messy draining. No metal taste from being in can too long. Lovely cuts of tuna and, though I've been buying exclusively in the pouch now for years, virtually never a bone to be found!! (Literally I've only found one little bone ever.)Great eaten as is, or mixed in tuna salad, tuna melt, etc. You have to try it!"
2,Missing Pouch and awful customer service,"The product is great. The tuna has great taste and is delicious.it took 22 days to get my order and surprise surprise the box only had 11 puches (instead of the 12).I called Customer Service and after 20 min of explanantion tey told me to go online and return the box to get another one. because this item is considered ""food"" it's not returnable.Bottom line the product is great but in this case the Amazon service was pretty low,"
4,An interesting narrative,"This is a clear logical and easy to follow history of the Air Force. Some interesting observations are made, especially regarding the Vietnam conflict. This is a book obviously written by someone who was watching the Air Force develop from the inside.A Good read that happens to inform."
2,The party line of the blue-suited brass,"I guess I should have known better, as Boyne represents Air Force officialdom. This overly intricate history reads more like a recruitment poster or boilerplate propaganda for use before congressional funding committees. Not very engaging, and one never quite knows where the oil comes from, a well or a snake. At any rate, the canvas of the Air Force presented here bears little resemblance to that obtained from biographies of some of the significant historical figures or American Aviation, e.g., Kelly Johnson, Robin Olds, John Boyd, et al, or more objective histories written by non Air Force historians. Bottom line, save your money."
4,HIS BEST !,While this CD doesn't have all of his best tracks ever recorded it does have most of them and certainly the more popular ones . I enjoy my blues music and this is no excpetion !
4,RDH Review,Very good collection of songs featuring some great blues harp.A must for anyone interested in the history and development of this genre.
5,His best: (Little Walter) The Chess 50th Anniversary Col,"Wonderful music! I listen to this cd everyday! If you like jump blues, buy this Cd"
5,Simply the greatest,"There are no bad songs on this overview of the career of maybe the greatest blues harp player of all time. Chess' compilations, be they boxsets or single disc comps, are all, in my experience, very well remastered. Buy it if you want to hear straight up great blues in the Chess tradition."
5,Listen to me before you buy!,"I'm new to the blues and especially the harmonica, but I know one thing about this CD. Two words can described it ""Bad ...!"" It is everything that I see the blues to be. This is true blues!"
5,Simply magic shoes!!,These shoes are the most comfortable shoes my boyfriend has ever worn! He needed some black shoes for his business school wardrobe and had been looking around for the perfect pair! I bought them for him for Christmas and he swears this was his favorite gift.They look amazing and they feel sooooooo good! He even had to buy some gel soles for his other dress shoes after being spoiled!Highly recommended!
2,poor quality control,"If this product worked as advertised I would be very happy, but Polar has replaced the watch three times in six months under warrantee because of defects. First the watch would not produce audible sound (chirp) in order to transfer data to my computer; then it acted erratically displaying clearly erroneous speed data and turning off while riding (among other things). This last watch could not be reset to work with the speed and cadence sensors so it would not accept any speed or cadence data.It it worked the CS 300 would be great, but Polar's quality control problems make me wish I had purchased from another company."
1,Broke in the first month!,"I would not recommend this product as it did not work out for me. Within the first month the top button broke so I could only move thru selections in one direction.When I called the company they wanted to charge me $44.95 just to look at it and potentially repair/replace it, they made sure to let me know I needed to mail it at my own expense and I would be charged for any repairs.The HR Monitor does ok, but it loses connectivity and all of a sudden during a workout your heart rate goes from 140 to 00 for about a minute until it creates a new link. The read out on the watch would be different than what was broadcast on cardio machines at my gym.All in all, a very poor product, I have had much better luck with Timex and Garmin. I will never buy a Polar product again."
2,I have got some problems,"I believe that my not so good experience with this product have been kind of unique based on what I have heard about the CS 300. Nonetheless, I think I should report it in this review. I had problems with my CS300; the computer simply restarted itself several times during my cycling and workouts. The unit was sent to Polar technical assistance in NY for test /review, so fair I am still waiting for their response. Another issue with this product is related to the data transfer through ""sound link"", it does not work smoothly.My older Polar, which I have been using for about 3-4 years, works very well."
5,So far excelent!,"I searched for this product for cycling and a ocasional run in the week. So far it is excelent tool for the byke, and keeping progress of my exercise during the week. I like the menu system that it comes with, it is very simple to use."
1,watch broke after 2 weeks,"Hi,The Polar CS300 broke after the 1st time I went into the water. It simply got mist from the inside of the dial face and stopped working a day or two later. I sent it back to Jomashop which claimed they fixed it. But when it came back the same thing happened. The watch was either unsealed or is cracked somewhere that cannot be detected.Polar USA claims that Jomashop is not a certified reseller and therefore I DO NOT recommend buying Polar products from them although they are sometimes much cheaper.Currently I cannot use the watch and after trying unsuccessfully to reach Jomashop and get their feedback to why the watch broke the 2nd time, I decided to give up and donate the watch to my kids collection.I had very good experience with other Polar watches that served me for many years but this experience made me consider other brands."
4,CS 300,"The product is very good, however, the sound communication with the computer and the software through the internet is defective."
1,Do not buy this product,"I've had this unit for a couple of years, and haven been really disappointed with it. The heart rate monitor is really erratic. Even though I live in a rural area (Santa Fe, NM), stray signals (from who knows what in this sparcely populated area)through the heart rate monitor off. The batteries in the cadence sensor and the heart rate sensor have to be replaced about once a year. Even worse, when the battery in the speed sensor is drained, you have to buy a whole new sensor. My speed sensor battery died in about two years. The cheapest price I've found for a new speed sensor is about $35.00, before shipping. I've decided to spend that $35.00 on another heart rate monitor. It will not be a Polar."
5,Great Value,"Excellent Watch, everithing you may need for a enthusiastic ride!! Accurate and easy to use.Fully recomended."
5,Great for studying,"I've done some of my best studying with this album. I've been using it for years and it helps me to focus for long peroids of time, espcially in public areas. It's just upbeat enough to keep you awake, but mellow enough that you don't become distracted. I've listened to this so many times that I've memorized every piece, and my brain's been conditioned to focus everytime I hear one. I highly recommend it."
4,Nice set for a nice price!,"I'm very happy with this dinette set. It fits perfect in my kitchen nook that's only about six feet long. After hours of shopping online and in furniture stores, this was a great find, especially for the price. The only downfall for me was the cushions. They appeared to be a solid color online, but there are actually some brown and orange/peach specks in them. Although, the way the chairs are put together makes them very easy to recover. Overall, I'm still pleased with the quality of the furniture."
1,BEWARE,horrible experience with this company. I bought this set a couple of years ago. It has fallen apart. Cheap quality. The picture looks great. It is when you get it that you realize you just got RIPPED OFF!!!!!!!. I can't believe this company is still in business.
3,Nice but small,My son-in-law was disappointed in how small this hamper was. It was nicely made but would have been nicer if bigger.
5,the best Wolf cd !,"I can't begin to try describing Howling Wolf's voice and music. All I can say is firmly state that this cd contains the best song made by The Wolf, and in good quality. No collection of 20th century music can be complete without this magnetic and magical music. Many of his songs, such as ""the little red rooster"" have been covered by other artists, but no one came close to sounding like him. I believe Howling Wolf is the greatest Chicago bluesman, with Elmore James, Muddy Waters and Otis Spann following closely behind. All the songs are great !"
5,Greatest vocalist in blues history,"Howlin Wolf was the greatest all-around blues musician EVER. ""Killing Floor"", ""300 Pounds of Joy"", ""Hidden Charms"", and ""Spoonful"" cannot be beaten for musical enjoyment. Wolf's powerful, almost animal voice has an intensity unlike any other vocals I've ever heard. The stinging, jagged guitar work by Hubert Sumlin complements the Wolf perfectly, making this album one of the pinnacles of blues perfection. The only possible complaint I could have is that they forgot to include one of my personal favorites, ""Tail Dragger""."
3,His Best Chess,"This CD was not what I was looking for. He played one item on the CD that was with the FULL sound, the others I didn't care for. I heard a song by him pertaining to a dope addict. I was told this was it - it was not. It was full and mesmerizing. Please recommend the CD I am looking for."
5,(HOWLIN'WOLF),THIS GUY IS A VOCAL GENIUS THE WAY HE CAN CHANGE HIS VOICE AND SING GREAT BLUES IS OUT OF THIS WORLD AN AWESOME BLUES CD.......
5,Wow!,"What a voice! Great fun to listen to, great fun to TRY to sing to! Catchy tunes, too. Great stuff!"
5,Some of the Howlin' Growlin' Wolf's best.,"This is a comprehensive collection of some of Howlin' Wolf's best music. The master of gravel voiced, gut bucket blues. A must have if you want to listen to Chicago electric blues......."
5,Fantastic!!!,"This is a must for every music collection. Moreover, it is a starting point. Once you get it, you'll be howling for more and more of The Wolf."
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. Charles Band should be ashamed of himself!","This movie is SUCH a disappointment, from the horrible actors to the horrible cheap-looking puppets. Where does Charles Band get these actors from, and the puppets???? Why make a movie with such stupid looking puppets? Go back to the original formula Charles Band! Stop making stupid movies and put a big enough budget into a Puppet Master movie!!!Don't rent, dont buy this stupid film. 0/5"
4,ed,i thought this was a good movie you got to see puppet masters axis which is puppet masters nine this is the sequel to it you see in puppet masters axis the man with the bad leg that wants to be a solger finds tolongs puppets in old building and the germans want the secret of the puppets magic but he keeps them hid from them and his mother and brother ends up getting killed by the germans so he gets the puppets to help him get the one responsible for the crime but at the end one of the puppets get stolen away so please dont down this movie untill you see axis this is a good movie in view
5,Love all puppet master movies,"This was entertaining and fun with great new puppets. I love the whole entire puppet master franchise,so if your like me dont miss out on the next chapter of puppet master exceptional!!!"
3,Good Buy,It is nice to have the complete series on dvd. The packaging is cheap andthe product is too. But I got what I paid for. I spent $13 on this complete set none of the discs were scratched by the paper envelopes however at least one episode would not play all the way through. On the whole still a good buy!
5,Loved this series,"The acting in this series is excellent. It shows good family values and true to life situations. All the charactersare believable and after watching the acting by Michael Chiklis, I orders all 7 series of The Shield. It is amazinghow different the two characters are. Of course The Commish is PG rated and The Shield is R for content."
5,Wonderful Series- Fear Not the Packaging,"In the normal Short life of a T.V. Series,lasting for five seasons is a real ""feat de accomple'"". The Commish is charming, well acted,and clever series. I had first purchased Season One and Season Two. After discovering that the complete series was now available, I also purchased it!After reading other reviews, there was a general consensuses that the packaging from Mill Creek was sub-standard. In this man's opinion, The packaging is fine. Great Series, Great Price! Buy with confidence!Robert WolterMilwaukee, WI."
1,NO SUBTITLES,"IN THIS AGE OF DVD AND BLUE RAY...TO ISSUE A SET WITH NO SUBTITLES IS INEXCUSABLE...I BOUGHT THESE AND IMMEDATLEY SENT THEM BACK...WHILE I AM NOT TOTALLY DEAF, THIS TRANSACTION MADE ME LEARN TO READ PROFILES OF ITEMS BEING SOLD...NO SUBS, NO SALE, PLAIN AS THAT..."
2,Is it REALLY uncut?,"In comparing this to ""The Commish: The Complete Series""The Commish: The Complete SeriesI noticed that the time is the same--73 hours and 41 minutes is the same as 4421 minutes. What I'd really like to know is how the uncut version is different and/or better than the complete series. The complete series has 18 reviews and more product information which I feel gives you a better understanding of what you are receiving than the information contained here."
3,The Commish: The Complete Series,"This commish is a good all around family show with many stereotypical keystone cops type of humor. I enjoyed a flashback to my childhood of watching this every week. However, I felt that after they killed off one of the main officers that it got overly cheesey. Of course back in the early 90's I thought it was a really cool show, and despite the cheese of the storylines, is still good to watch today. I don't want to give away any more spoilers so I will leave it at that.The packaging is very cheap like other reviewers have mentioned. It comes in a large hard back case, and the individual DVD's are in individual black cd sleeves.It should also be noted that Season 5 is not really a season, but a series of about 4 or 5 made for TV movies and there is only one disc (for season 5). When I got my set I thought that some discs were missing. After contacting the manufacturer they informed me of this."
5,"Missing some parts, excellent quality","Quality of the picture is surprisingly very good, but I think that the episodes were edited and some parts were cut out of it..."
5,"Packaging is terrible, clarity could be better but it's every episode!!!!!!!","Happy they finally released this series in full! Dvds come in sleeves, very cheap but no biggie. ***I paid [...] for the complete series*** Amazon has been switching the price from $68 to [...]. So wait it out if it's $68. I'm on season 3 right now, I miss these old plots and not all this new crap on csi with the same old story. The Commish is my favorite old time drama tv series. If you are thinking of buying yet never watched an episode, you will not be disappointed. RUN TIME is 73 hrs....enjoy!"
3,"Love The Commish, but.......","I have been waiting a long time for the complete series. I am happy it is finally here.All 17 discs are in paper envelopes!!!! Bad! Very bad!!!!I will be buying a cd wallet to store my DVDs in-The picture isn't all that great on some of the episodes-I wish they had spent a little more $ to make this a better product-But I got my Commish, so I will take what I can get-Did I mention I HATE the paper envelopes?????"
1,dont waste your money,Do not order this product. You will regret your purchase. Half of the discs in my set do not work. Also packaging is crappy! Paper envelopes all shoved into a plastic case!
3,What's the difference?,Is the studio mill creek? What is the difference between the $39 one compaired to the $19? Is the packing just as cheap as mill creeks?
5,Great,"I only saw random episodes when it aired here in Denmark, so I was thrilled to get the entire series on DVD. The Commish is funny, yet thrilling and compelling. I was delighted to see that the pilot episode was there too, which never aired here"
4,Security problem on accompanying CD,"I noticed that on the 2nd CD that is included with this book there is a script called: ""make_firewall.sh"" If you execute this script, it will start to ""rpm -e"" (yes that's erase) all the RPMs listed in an accompanying file called ""rpms_to_remove"". Nowhere on the CD does it tell you that this script will do this. I suspect it was placed there in error. BE CAREFUL!Otherwise I find this book pretty good for a beginning understanding of Linux networking."
4,One More Thought On The Security Scripts,"My earlier review should have mentioned Hans Cathcart's comments about scripts which remove installed products. He thinks the script was added to the CD in error. If you check the book carefully you will find a discussion of why some installed packages should be removed. Chapter 12 starting at about page 386 discusses removal of unnecessary software on a *firewall computer*. Mr. Sery is talking in the context of a standalone firewall machine, not your personal work machine. It's important to understand this distinction and to read Chapter 12 before you run any of his scripts from the CDs. You would not want to run these security scripts on your *personal* machine.Of course Mr. Sery is overlooking a small fact -- most home users don't have the money or knowhow to set up a standalone firewall computer, quite separate from their personal work machines."
2,Good format but riddled with errors,"I agree with the reviewer that stated that this book was poorly proofed - if at all. The format of the book is very good, but it is so riddled with errors that you end up going in circles trying to figure out what the author is trying to tell you to do. I ended up using this book as my primary source for getting my Samba network up and running, but only because I couldn't find a better reference. I hope that a revised edition will be coming out for Red Hat Linux 7.0/7.1, and I hope that the myriad errors in the current edition will be addressed."
2,Should have done more research,"Outdated, covers installation of Windows 95 along side older Linux distros. Managed to pull a couple useful tidbits out of it so I refuse to rate it lower than 2 stars"
1,Very poorly proofed (if at all) book,"Although Mr. Sery starts with extremely good intentions, this book was so poorly proofed that it is worse than no help at all. One can find serious typographical errors on almost any page, ranging from misspelled keywords, to sentences that just end in the middle of a thought. Often the text instructs you to do one thing, but the representative screen shot shows completely different information. The only way I would recommend this book would be for students of typesetting to study as an excellent example of how not to practice their art. Based on this one experience, I have no plans to ever buy another book from the publisher, IDG Books, nor the author.Patrick Krepps"
2,Not useful for connecting to internet using DSL/Cable,"I am very dissapointed with this book. If you are looking to setup a firewall/gateway Linux box and you have a cable modem/DSL, look somewhere else. This book is primarily about Samba and how to setup an internal network. There are 2 chapters regarding gateways/firewalls but they assume you are using a regular modem. The web site for the book contains no information for us cable modem folks. The Ipchains discussion was not helpful at all.Also the screen shots in Chapter 1 are very dated and do not reflect what you see when you install the distribution on the cd. Don't buy this book to learn how to install linux."
3,Dr. Sinatra in the crowd of similar books,"I rate this book a 3 star not because it is not a good book, but because I read his book The Sinatra Solution first. The Sinatra Solution was a better read for me. This Lower Your Blood Pressure in Eight Weeks was just a little generic for my taste...having read a couple of books like this one. However, I believe that this book is well suited to anyone desiring to learn and improve their cardiovascular health."
2,Lower you blood pressure in 8 weeks,"there is some worthwhile info here, but the food recipes are difficult to prepare and store.Unless you can prepare all of nyou food at home, this book is not worth it."
2,Whats new...,Not any new information in this book that can't be found for free by searching the internet...overall most people can visit their local natural food store and get the same information from the sales person.
4,Remarkable,"Eight weeks ago I was diagnosed with isolated systolic hypertension (BP 160/64). I was already doing some of the book recommendations before I read it. Then I started on the full program right away. Now my resting BP is running 115/68 to 120/75 and my weight went from 160lbs to 150lbs. While I did NOT feel poorly eight weeks ago, I now feel unbelievably GREAT. I will be 70 years young in September 2008.I think I should also report that my physician put me on ZOLOFT 100MG DAILY eight weeks ago. This reduced anxiety and depression and may have helped reduce my BP."
3,FINALLY on DVD,"I first saw this movie for a literature class in High School. I found the story to be surprisingly captivating. Erendira's spartan life is depressing. She lives with her grandmother who prostitutes her to all sorts of men.It's a gloomy story. The whole concept of the winds of misfortune is an element of Garcia Marquez' 'magical realism'.It's hard to write this without giving away the story. All in all this is definetely a film worth watching. It's not a polished production by any extent, but it's crudely effective."
4,This man knows Kraftwerk cuisine,"Karl Bartos, best known for his role in german mensch machine Kraftwerk, issued this album, 'Communication' which can be called enough nice to draw attention of electro lovers. This opus demonstrates clearly that Karl was not that far from Kraftwerk studio processes as Ralf Hutter tried to show. But he's definitely ex-Kraftwerk, he understands the spirit of late 70s electronic music and delivered it to the 00s. Thus, as you can probably imagine, the album sounds a bit outdated but only a bit, on the other side it is a balsam for all Krfatwerk admirers. You should also buy Kraftwerk's 'Tour De France Soundtracks' just to make a comparison between real Kraftwerk and what sometimes was a part of it."
2,Boring...,"This game continues with the great graphics that Red Storm has been consitant with, HOWEVER, I managed to finish this game in about 2 hours. The only challenge was the many ""beat the clock"" type scenarios.BUT, if you never played any of the Rainbow Six collection, this is a must to get you started.Get it and start wacking TANGO's left and right!"
2,Is this really by red storm!?,"I own every rainbow six game. I am so so so disappointed, the textures in the game were old. Details were left out big time, I expected this to be the best on account of it being the newest, and probobly the last add on to rogue spear. And I know my guns big time, red storm paid no attention to making the guns real like. Basicly this was a last attempt to make more money, but it was worth it because it expanded th multiplayer possiblilities. I say if you like playing it online, go for it. But if you want something more than just covert ops, dont get it. I dont want to knock red storm down completely, but i play operation flashpoint. If you've played it, you would know what im talking about."
2,NOT WORTH IT!!!,"First let me start off saying that this expansion pack was probably a last-ditch effort for R6 before Ghost Recon came out (which is an excellent game i might add). I bought Black Thorn for [price], and it only comes with 9 missions, and a couple new guns. Its VERY boring! I wish i'd never bought it. The graphics are pretty ok, the sound is good (creative EAX), game play is fine, but it just doesnt live up to the other R6's. I'd get Ghost Recon insted."
3,Black Thorn,"I have heard that this game was highly anticipated, then when it was relaesed, it was dissapointing. I really looked forward to it and i read the reviews, and i said ""Forget it"" and i bought a better game like Delta Force 2. I heard this game has cool graphics and neat new weapons like the French FAMAS G2 rifle, FN P90 5.7mm submachine gun, and the Steyr TMP. Although these weapons sound cool, the difference in the weapons compared to the other weapons is just noise and range. Usually, 3 round bursts from any weapon will drop a tango (terrorist). But, it has neat, new missions in cool places and has cool counter-terrorism tactics."
4,"a little heavy on the ""quality""","A very beautifully produced and sounding album, this most recent work by Daho also unfortunately sounds thematically bloated. After the near-perfect pop of ""Eden"", Daho's obviously wanted to create some kind of ""masterwork"": this lends many of the tracks an undeserved pompousness - hah! even speaking of it sounds pretentious! There are some great moments, though, especially the melodies of the title track, ""Le Brasier"", ""Rendez-vous a Vedra"" and the very Bacharach-sounding horn arrangement of ""La Baie""."
4,debunking creation,"I bought this book because my 7-year-old has learned to say hi to Jesus when he passes by a church (thanks to grandma). He stopped believing in Mother Nature and I wanted to nip religious fanaticism in the bud. This book worked! It is beautifully illustrated, interesting, and full of cool facts. It furthered our discussions about creation vs. evolution and since my son is a lover of dinosaurs, he is on his way to scientific allegiance. I highly reccommend it to any parent who wants to teach children about the history of the earth and to unteach insipid mythology. *Although I must warn, it has quite a bit of writing and big words for young children."
5,A great Start for Kids,"My 4h grade son and I love this book! The collage illustrations in the oversized book are simple, attractive and uncluttered. We discussed them and guessed how they are made.The text is also clear and uncluttered. My son found it easy to understand. We especially liked the part on Natural Selection which showed a bunch of frogs and how only the fitest survived.The heads of several of Darwin's finches are shown to illustrate the difference in their beaks, and it points out how each beak is suited to the birds' diet.Highly Recommended"
2,Unbelievable,"I got this book from the library and was reading it with my daughter.The illustrations are wonderful and overall it is a good introductory to evolution for kids.However I find it unbelieveable that the author describes the appearance of the primate/human ""common ancestor"" as being descended from apes.For someone who thinks himself knowlegable enough to be writing educational books for any age on the theory of evolution this ""mistake"" is unforgivable.Considering the idea is the most repeated falsity used by ignorant opponents of evolution.You are not helping to educate children by feeding them ignorance.It`s enough to keep me from reading anything else written by this author."
5,"""Lost Soul""","Even though I grew up in the mid-west in the 60's listening to WLS and WLAC, I only remember a few of the songs on this double album. But all of the others seem like ""old friends,"" and match those found in any STAX collection. Chess also has some great Blues collections, but if Soul's your game, this is one of the best!"
2,"This isn't American style, at all -- it's New York style","In typical NY magazine fashion, this book by a small design magazine shows a narrow range of design approaches with an East Coast bias -- or a bicoastal look, at best. I get the feeling that the editors never venture west of the Hudson, to use that cliche. I returned the book."
5,"A Tremendous Resource for the ""Some-time"" Counselor","As someone who often counsels as part of my job, and will be attending an upcoming Stephen Minsitry training, I rediscovered this book on my shelf, and appreciate it even more than on my first ""pass-through"" years ago. The authors celebrate the thousands (maybe millions) of people who are thrust into counseling roles on a daily basis, so they charge ahead and describe positive actions we can take to make our ""supportive counseling"" role work to the counselee's advantage. The authors have numerous descriptions of problem behaviors that provide a real reference for the lay person, but the real strength in the book is the care they take in illustrating the relationship between the counselor and counselee. The chapter on ""Hard-bought Wisdom"" is alone worth the price of the book. I'm glad to see that it is back-ordered; there's hope that it won't permanently be out of print. If you are a part-time counselor, I highly recommend this book."
5,Excellent dance album,"One of my favourite albums to dance to. Couldn't name a bad track, every one has a nice swing that lets you feel the music when you dance to it. If your only going to have one album in your dance collection make it this one."
3,Nice Mix .....,"I bought this CD basiclly for a couple songs. ""Tu mama no quiere"" by los Hermanos Moreno and "" que tienes esa Mujer"" by Ray De La Paz. However I have attended a couple Barcardi Congreso De La Salsa here in Puerto Rico and the music and dancer really make it a extravaganza. Well the cover of this CD can fool you, The cover is better than its content. The mix of songs are not bad. As you can see I gave it a 3 out of 5."
2,Disappointed!,"I must not have read the description correctly, this movie was not at all what I expected and very disappointing. A waste of money. Vendor is good though and is certainly not responsible for poor movie."
5,A REAL MOVIE LOVER'S REVIEW!!!!,"Watching ""The Union"" for the very first time made me laugh a little at first because A)it started out looking like one of those low budget films and B) I'm not too much into Vamires. After watching it again, I put myself past all that and into the movie, focusing on the actual plot that exists (unlike a lot of these other Hollywood vampire flicks).""The Union"" is EXTREMELY well acted considering these actors and actresses are NOT professional high-paid movie stars! The movie is a short...the only damper...and makes you want to see more.Definately give this film a go! You'll be suprised at what ""The Union"" has to offer!"
4,Excited for the Feature Length!,"I think that this short would make for a great feature length film... or even a great mini-series for HBO or SYFY. The Union certainly showed the potential it has to run with the big dogs.The behind-the-scenes extras on the making of this short was very insightful as to the hard work that goes into making a film from conception to delivery, and hopefully beyond.I want to see what happens next!"
3,Handy bag - youth sized,"This bag is good, but slightly undersized. My boots and helmet barely fit, and I can stuff gloves and goggles, but not much else. I'll probably be giving this to my son next season since his boots and helmet are smaller. It's durable and great to stuff the bare necessities in, but the pockets are just a little too small."
4,Serves it's purpose,"Very large center compartment will hold helmet, hydration pack (camelbak menace), shell jacket. Boots fit nicely in side pocket. All fits in overhead compartment in most planes (bottom of bag facing out). Top pocket is very convenient."
2,"Good overview, But not useful for SAP ESS developers","If you want to understand, what is ESS, how it works, its overview and architecture. Then this is the book for you. But if you want to develop and implement ESS applications this is not the book for you. Instead you can refer online documentation. As a developer you need better knowledge of BHTML and Java script and how they work interactivity with R/3 applications like transactions and RFCs. I don't suggest this book for you. Unfortunately no book is available currently for developers except bits and pieces of information in SAP online documentation for this purpose. So best of luck in doing experiments with R/3 ESS. Thanks"
4,My Review of ESS Impl. Guide,very good comprehensive book for a better understanding in sap's employee self-services. the book shows all steps for implementing ess. unfortunately it's not going in details in topics like workflow and changing the surface of ess.
4,Good Book for understanding SAP Employee Self Service,It has good information if you want to understand the architecture of SAP Employee Self Service. It has step by step instructions about customizing the ESS. Good explanation about installing ITS.
4,Place!,"THE BIG HORSE is to what every trainer aspires. It is a horse that captures the imagination and wins the biggest stakes. P.G. Johnson's first big horse Volponi came in the twilight of Hall of Fame racing career. Volponi captured the 2002 Breeder's Cup Classic and prepares for the 2003 race in this account of horse and trainer.As a book Seabiscuit did it better, but that is almost like saying as a horse Secretariat did it better. Joe McGinniss takes you into the world of 21st Century horse racing in the same way Laura Hillenbrand returned us to the glamour of horse racing in the late 1930s.With a point of view switching between author and trainer the cadences are those of the denizens of the stables and betting windows. This particular authenticity surpasses even Hillenbrand.McGinniss has returned, and how we have missed him."
3,What about Volponi?,"The Big Horse is a very well-written book that provides insight to the life of a horse trainer. Interesting, unless you bought the book for the horse. Although the book is supposed to be centered around the horse, there are no details of his races, or much about his personality etc. It is a great way to remember the late P.G. Johnson, but now write a book for Volponi!"
3,Just ok,"I am an avid race fan and enjoy reading about the subject. However, the storyteller lacks passion and imagination. P. Johnson is not the most endearing character but he is a great horseman. The author does not bring insight or detail into the story or offer a window into the trainers life and soul. He reiterates stories told by Mr. Johnson but offers little narrative. It is a fast read if the subject is of interest but Volponi was not that great of a runner and the poor thing is in Korea, now. I hope he is still alive."
3,Arrived damaged,"Have no idea how well the unit actually works - it arrived damage so I never plugged it in. The cabinet broke away from the base of the unit during shipping. This appears to be due partially to the design of the unit (this junction was weak) and packaging (being weak, it was even more important to support it for shipping.) Given that the unit weighed about 90 lbs, it was not pleasant to pull it out of the packaging, only to have to re-package it to return it. However, the return went smooth and my purchase credited promptly. I ended up buying a Amcor Nanomax A12000EH instead, which works great."
1,Cant understand this film due to no English titles!,"I ordered this film from Amazon and took it back with me to Singapore where we can play any format. I was surprised to find that this French foreign film does not have any English Titles. I have heard wonderful things about this film but I was not ever expecting to order it in the United States and have no mention that it has no English titles. After all, the US is supposed to be an English speaking country. The product detail mentions that it is not zoned for the USA but it never says it lacks titles. So if you don't understand French then do not purchase this product."
4,Great watch,"ordering another one cuz the band broke, I would pay more for a better band but it is a great watch.large display and tough as hell except for the band...the old one is velcroed(is that a verb) to the inside of my tool box lid! 5 stars except for the band."
5,Great replacement watch,"I had a Timex for 20 years, very similar to this, that I LOVED, so when the setting button finally stopped working, finding a great replacement was difficult. I hate the plastic cases, and wanted an all stainless one. Even Timex no longer makes one. This great watch is a little bigger than my Timex was (both are men's watches) but I really like the big digits for time and date, and the infitely (nearly) adjustable band, as my work can be physical which means swollen wrists in hot weather, and smaller on cooler days. Being able to adjust the band to any size in only seconds without having to add or remove links or take the band off the watch is one thing I loved about my old Timex, and this band is just the same style. It's a little lighter weight band, not quite so sleek, but it's a great watch. I'd recommend it!"
2,Casio Men's A178WA-1A Illuminator Bracelet,The case is plastic not stainless steel as listed on amazon.its cheap but may not last very long so if you are buying based on the info listed it not correct
3,An OK watch,If there is enough light this watch does everything well and the display is fine but in dim or no light the display is near invisible and the internal light in the watch is marginal at best. But for the price it is OK.
2,Probably a good value for the price.,"I like this slim style of watch because I don't need all the functions of a sports watch. A Digital watch gives me the day, the date, and the time of day. That's what I am looking for. An analogue watch will not provide all that information. I have a Casio G-Shock wave receptor/solar watch that I've worn for eight years and it works perfectly. But it's geting banged up and I wanted to get a new digital watch. I'll probably give this new watch to the Goodwill. It just looks cheap and that is disappointing to me though not surprising considering the price. I would gladly pay one hundred dollars if Casio came out with a ""classy looking"" business style digital watch that had a little larger case and was made of better metal materials."
3,OK for the price.,"Nice watch for the price. It has a large face that is easy to see. The bracelet band pulls hair; I'd prefer an expansion type. The worst part is that it loses about 4 seconds a week, and that adds up pretty fast."
3,Thick Watch,"I bought this watch for the dual time zones and because it's digital [I do not like analog watches], both of which the watch meets; but the third requirement was thin case. The watch is advertised with it's thickness, I guess I was hoping the specs were wrong or I didn't realize it was over 1/4 inch thick, way too big and bulky. I gave it 3 stars because it's not what I hoped for, not because it doesn't function correctly. If I was not concerned about the thickness, I would have given it 5 stars."
4,Good Value,I've had it for about a month and it is doing its job. The numerals are large and easy to read. Has all the bells and whistles I wanted. And the price was very reasonable.
3,1st Silver Watch in over 20 years,"This is a beautiful watch with a good and Large digital display. It is easy to use and set. It is a little thicker than I expected. Compared to the Timex Chronograph that I retired after over 20 years of fateful service, this watch was no more expensive and has a 10 year battery life."
4,Casio Watch,The watch does everything I want it too. I wished it had a larger face and a better band. For the money it is a good value. I would buy it again.
3,You Get What You Pay For,Watch is very inexpensive and a good buy if you don't expect much. The clasp is hard to snap into place and even harder to unsnap. The led is not much use as it's not very bright even in dark environments. This watch replaced a Timex and I should have spent the extra $10 and got another Timex.
5,One of a Kind,"It is almost impossible to find a 100%, good-quality digital watch with a metal band like this one. This is a very good, accurate watch which is good for everyday use."
4,Title,Simple watch that preforms everything i needed. I like it a lot. Really don't need a watch that does anything this one doesn't
3,Another Casio Watch Issue!!!,"Casio has gone out of their way to produce the CHEAPTIST watches possible!! This watch was a watch I had own and used everyday for several years, when I finally used it up, I was very glad to find the same watch on AMAZON, so I ordered this watch, but when it arrived and opened it, was I ever in for a great dissapointment, the band was much shorter than my original, the band was much cheaper built than my original, the over all watch was much cheaper and nothing like my original!! WhenI placed my order I knew that I was going to be set for several more years of service from CASIO, but I pretty sure that these will be my last Casio Watches!!!JLF"
3,Practical watch,Certainly a practical watch with easy to see numbers on a fairly large display. My problem with it was with the bracelet that occasionally caught the finer hairs on my wrist and arm and startet pulling them. It got annoying and I stopped wearing the watch after a few weeks.
5,Good Everyday Watch,"I wanted an easy to read digital everyday watch and this is it! First of all it's not one of those big/thick/bulky plastic watches with the easy-to-wearout plastic watch bands. A quick glance at it's face and you have it all: hr/min/year/month/day/date. It has backlight for night, stopwatch function, 2nd time zone feature/hourly beep if wanted, and even an alarm feature. As stated on the watch itself it claims to have a 10-year battery. At this price of under $20 just throw it away when battery is dead and buy a new one!!!"
4,So far so good,"My husband has had several similar Casio watches, generally with various memory options. Over time he has lost the data, so this time it is just a watch and he is pleased with it. I chose this one because it had a metal strap. The rubber/plastic ones break long before the battery is dead. What is the use of a 10 year battery on a watch with a two year strap?"
5,LoVe iT! :),Very Pretty Watch! ...Looks like a Quality Piece at 14$!!!! cant beat that for the Money... very nice polish on metal face & and wrist band.
2,Problem,"After wearing watch for two weeks, on a trip I pushed the mode button in to change time due to time changes, and the button stayed in and I could not get button to pop out, watch had wrong time for two weeks until I got back home to send back.11/29/2012After I sent back the above watch, I ordered a replacement ( same watch ) On 11/04 I discovered when I tried to change the time from daylight savings, that both buttons on the left side were sticking and hard to push in, I could push in on the mode button using a knife handle and pushing hard,and the button did come back out enough to allow me to set the time and continue to use the watch, I only hope that come March 2013 I will be able use the mode button to change back to daylight savings time."
4,Good watch for the price,"This simple watch was what I wanted. No bells or whistles, just a easy to read watch. Easy to set and simple band."
4,"Casio Men's A178WA-1A Digital Watch, stainless case & band",Purchased this watch to replace two broken resin case wrist watches that broke with a few weeks of light use. Took a bit of time to learn how to use the clasp on the watch band (last stainless steel band watch was purchased in early 1970's and had different type of fastening feature -- subsequent watches had buckle). Have very small wrist and the band adjustment is convenient.
2,muy lindo en foto pero....,"El producto me llego en el tiempo indicado y bien empacado, pero el display del reloj, es decir la pantalla donde esta la hora y la fecha me llego torcida, desnivelada, ladeada, entonces si el reloj se ve de frente el display se ve con una caida de un lado asi que parece que esta descuadrado y eso hace que se vea de mala calidad. si es casio deben mantener por lo menos un nivel de calidad y esto lo hace ver de chinatown."
2,dim light,"The light is useless. Dim, green. Digital display practically invisible when you press the light button! Buttons are too easily pressed unintentionally. Irritating!!"
2,No Rainmaker!,"I bought this book because I garnered great value from the previous books by Jeffrey Fox (all of which I gave 5 stars). This one disappoints as there is very little new. If you've read other books by Fox, avoid this one (just re-read the marketing chapters from Rainmaker). The one chapter that kept me from completely tossing the book was titled ""Always put the Brand Name in the Headline."" My advice to Fox: slow down the writing pace; let the ideas mature a bit more and stop the Instant Quizes."
1,This book Stunk,"What a waste of paper. I kept hoping there would be some bits of wisdom I could use. None inside. All basic common sense stuff. Do not waste your time on this book. His other book, How to become a Ranmaker was actually pretty good. What the hell was he doing writing this 172 pages of all filler? I dont' get it."
3,Revisiting,"Jeffery has a to-the-point style that's easy to like. His must-read book isHow to Become a Rainmaker: The Rules for Getting and Keeping Customers and Clients. If you like that, you'll probably like his other books, even though there is overlap.I read Marketing Superstar years ago and went through it now. Ideas that felt fresh before now seem ""obvious"". That doesn't mean the ideas are stale but that I've adopted them. Maybe that's the mark of a useful book."
3,This is a basic classic easy read,This recommendation is based on having read dozens of books in this genre and taking thorough notes.This is a basic classic easy read.
4,Helpful marketing tips from a pro,"I've read a lot of Jeff's books and have always been able to come away with something useful from them. This one is no different. Helpful, practical advice from a master."
2,Cannonball II hard to watch.,"There may never be a movie produced ever again as loosely or without guilt as this one. Filmed in 1984, this movie was filmed using some of the least-expensive actors avalible. With a budget that probably went mostly to Burt Reynolds, and trying to get by with filming completely in the desert (free). Sometimes actor's cars will change from Corvettes to Plymoths, then back again thinking no one would notice. With a script that Jr. High school children would find simple,this movie drags viewers through it like nails on a chalkboard. If it weren't for just enjoying watching three of the original Rat Pack up walking around talking, this movie would have been a complete wash. Good luck."
2,Out of control feature length In-Joke,"It was a great idea to take the ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" approach and present many legends at a later point in their careers: Frank Sinatra has a great scene and Dean, Sammy, and Shirley have their moments, too. There is also a totally hilarious Brando send-up by Dom DeLuise. Anyway, despite some classic bits and pieces, we have a lost opportunity to make a mediocre movie folks would love! (Did I mention that I bought the tape for Catherine Bach?...)."
2,DISGUSTINGLY AWFUL QUALITY DVD!,"All comments about the film aside, whether you love it or hate it, I have to say this is the worst DVD I ever bought. No extras. The print of the movie is poor, grainy. And it's not even in widescreen. It's an obvious video transfer. Very disappointing.On the other hand the movie is dire. But this is a good thing. Canonball Run 2, along with its predecessor has kitch value. I mean Daisy from the Dukes of Hazard in a spandex jumpsuit?! That's worth the price of admission alone."
2,Poor transfer but worth adding to your collection,"There are no extras on this DVD. Outtakes for this one have always been in the ending credits though. The transfer to DVD is very poor, but since it available for such a low price you might as well add it to your collection, since I don't think there is enough public demand for a ""Cannonball Run II: Special Edition DVD"" anytime soon."
3,Great movie let down by poor transfer.,"Unfortunately i have to agree with a few other fellow reviewers that this is a great movie but the transfer of video to dvd leaves alot to be desired. I found it to be no better than an ancient ex-rental copy, the sound also suffers also. But i guess it cant get much worse, it will always look the same whereas a video will eventually wear out and die. So its still worth adding to your collection if you enjoy this movie."
2,The Cannonball Run 2 (1983),"This film is exactly like its original only this time the mob is after them. And also instead of Michael Hui, Jackie's capilot is Richard Kiel (the giant who played ""Jaws"" in 2 James Bond Movies: ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and ""Moonraker""). But then again it's quality is very poor... if you want to buy it don't waste your money on the expensive DVD edition, buy it on the cheap VHS edition. Jackie Chan still appears in a few cameo appereances but this time a few more."
1,A Candidate For The Worst Movie Ever Made,"Move over ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" you've got a serious challenger in Burt Reynolds and the ""Cannonball Run 2.""Pick what ever descriptive word you like: acting, writing, directing, sets, musical score, and then insert the adjective ""bad"" in front of it. That just about describes everything you need to know about this move."
3,Shirley Maclaine is strange,In the outtakes she starts shaking her head around and smirking weird. Then she goes into character. How strange she is. As for the film itself well it's a bit less well written and crafted than film one. BUt it's good too.
1,Ugh!,"I enjoyed the original Cannonball Run, but this film should never had been made. It should have been torpedoed in the planning stages. There was very little that was enjoyable about this bomb. I enjoyed the Tim Conway and Don Knotts cameos, but that's about it. Even the angry ape wasn't funny especially after the news of the ape that horribly attacked that woman a few years ago. Take my advice and skip it."
4,Funny,Not as good as the Original. But how many sequels are. It's still really funny though. If you like fast cars and fast women it's your kind of movie.
5,fantastic,"video was in excellent shape and quality. does not tile or freeze. was delivered in a timely manner and at a resonable price. have been trying to cannonball run 2 for many years, but no one had it. If I had known it was this inexpensive, I would have gotten it a long time ago. I have been getting my stargate series the same way and thought I would try it out. It worked great! I'm even thinking of getting the daniel boone series the same way. thanks a lot amazon for all your help."
3,Something just works.,"Cannonball Run was not a movie sceaming for a sequel, but here it is for better or worse. However, there is something about watching the rat pack mixing it up with a whole new generation of stars. It's like a Love Boat episode and about as weighty, but it's innocent fun.Shirley MacLaine has the best line in the whole film when dressed as a nun she attracts the attention of an entire coffee shop."
2,well....,"Ok, I think the first CBR is one of the funniest movies EVER. This sequel is pretty lame though. There are some funny bits but most of the cast is wasted in this. I forgot how bad Dean Martin looked in this one. Ah well, for the price I guess it's good for completists. This version is full screen but you can always get the HK version which is widescreen if that makes a difference. ""Ah, General Patton, and... General Admission."""
3,For the Fans,"If you loved the first Cannonball then you'll love the second; in fact if you liked the ""Smokey and the Bandit"" movies then you like ""Cannonball.""In my humble opinion, this is a good movie, not a great movie. One that you can watch over and over again, but won't neccessarly be your first choice when picking one out.If you're a fan or this era of movie or Burt Reynolds then you should get this movie."
3,Funny and Entertaining,"Enjoyed the movie, but was disappointed when I seen that the price was cheaper at BestBuy.com including the shipping."
1,An Honest Review!,This movie is great! But the reason I gave it a 1 star was coz Jackie Chan had a very small role and he appeared through both movies. I know his english isn't good but he could've done some of the fighting scenes
4,Great regional dialogue in this newcomer,"P.J. Grady just got nominated for a Shamus award for her first book, set in New Mexico. You can see why -- her private detective is unusual. She's a blue collar, in-your-face gal. Unlike a ton of other detectives she isn't an alcoholic, doesn't drive an exotic car, doesn't even have a love life. She has a ton of friends and it is entertaining to ""listen"" to them all talk. The dialogue is really great, doesn't falter anywhere. The plot moves along. The author really seems to know about prisons and prison life, and it is refreshing to see this kind of plot involving inmates, wardens, correction officers and the town hosting a huge prison. A great start by this author and I will look for the next one."
1,Not worth the space it takes up!,"This is the worst piece I own by Cuisinart. I generally like their products but this thing stinks. My girlfriend bought me this for X-Mas (after I picked it out!). Let me say that I would give it negative stars if possible. I now have to waste time and fuel to drive it back to the store to recuperate the cost. The thing fell apart after 1/8 of an onion--which is, btw, all the space this thing has to chop. Was not sharp enough to cut through the tougher, outer onion layer. P-l-e-a-s-e! I took it all the way apart to see what could possibly ""jam"" a manual food chopper. I noticed that the blade piece unscrewed from the hand piece. No problem, right? Wrong, wrong! The pieces would not stay together. Needless to say that it almost ruined X-Mas once my girlfriend had to go digging through the trash for the receipt . . ."
1,Not up to the task!,"Doesn't work. Too bad--good idea, especially the self-rotating bit. Would not cut through the red pepper skin. Same for Portabello mushrooms-not the toughest items to cut. I tried it with the guard, without the guard (food got trapped in blades), on the base and on a cutting board. I tried pressing hard and fast, and with a slower motion. In every case, it mangled rather than cut and did not go all the way through. I can do the job with a knife better and faster.I chose the Cuisinart model because I'd read quite a few negative reviews of choppers in general, but I had faith in the Cuisinart brand and thought they could get it right. Use a knife, or a food processor."
1,Broke the First Time We Used It,"I reviewed various brands of this product and noted that some of them were really cheap and broke easily.... so I chose Cuisinart because I associate the brand with quality. Unfortunately the problem is the product, no matter what name you give it.The Cuisinart Food Chopper broke the first time we used it.I'm sending it back in favor of a mini-food processor. This product is just a bad idea whose time has gone."
1,Broke on first use,"This item is terrible, broke on the first use when I was trying to chop a quarter of an onion. Absolute pile of junk, which is surprising given the Quisinart name."
4,Yet another South Side star shines brightly...,"Like his Muddy Waters Band contemporary, Little Walter, some of Jimmy Rogers' best work was done before he went solo. After ""Luedella"" broke in 1956, Rogers had already become yet another star in the galaxy that was launched by Waters' seminal band. Although the two Chess ""Muddy Waters: His Best"" would serve as the ideal introduction for both Rogers and Little Walter, I think this disk would be a good buy for anyone interested in Rogers guitar style or anyone that might be interested in hearing the Muddy Waters Band without Muddy Waters on lead vocals. Recommended, but not essential though the craftsmaship is, of course, superb and influential throughout."
3,Good overview,"The book starts off describing some of the origins of terror, beginning with the Roman Empire. It then steamrolls through the successive centuries picking examples throughout history of why terror doesn't pay off. While I understand the point, I feel the author tried to cover too much ground in too little space. More concrete examples and more direct writings and quotations from key players would have made the examples stronger.The author also brushes over exceptions to the rule, including post-war Japan and Germany.Overall, it's decent book that gets you thinking about terrorism in an objective manner...it's just a little bit light on the details."
4,Inclusive,This book includes more than i expected. There is about everything in this field and in a very clear and detailed way. It is'nt written for beginners.
1,Not Chrome,"This product is not chrome, it's plastic. The handles are plastic with a chrome color finish to them. Very cheap feeling. Plus the handles don't actually attach to anything,they just sort of float in the wall.And the instructions don't have any words on them. Only pictures. I'm still not sure what to do with the packet of goop included.Very disappointing for a Moen product."
1,cheap plastic,I bought this bathroom set and for the price I thought I was getting something decent. I soon realized that it is made out of plastic and if you turn the knob just slightly too hard (to make sure the water is off and not dripping) then it will crack and basically break. I am so upset about this product that I had to leave a review.
1,No more Moen faucets for me,"I added another bathroom on my 12 year old home.The faucet in 12 yr old bath is a much cheaper brand and still going strong.After about 10 showers the middle shower knob froze up,won't turn.The hot water won't shut completely off either.I hate to tear wall out to replace this faucet with another brand but may have to"
1,Worst Play by Worst Playwright Ever,"I love live theater, reading plays, watching video of plays.In all sincerity, this play is the worst play ever by the worst playwright ever.The core idea of the play is that life is meaningless, something you ""get"" 5 minutes into it.But the playwright makes us experience that life is meaningless, in slow-motion.I would rather experience open heart surgery without anesthetics than to ever endure this play again. It's that bad. No, it's worse."
3,Stagnant yet painful yet beautiful yet ugly,Amazingly written with humor and pain. The characters were too stagnant and they lacked color.
2,disturbing,"just didn't like it, too much angst,too much unresolved anger.A poor representation of both Jews and Christians.Not a compelling story,"
5,Awesome book,I could not put this book down. I never knew that Jews were treated this way by Christian extremists. Is it all part of the fiction of this book?I have been taught that being a Christian is about showing Christ's love not telling people they are gonna burn.I feel this book showed that love.
5,A Thriller and Much More,"This book was a finalist for a Christy Award in 2003. I was very happy to see the author's updated version become available for Kindle.As Dickson explains in an Author's Note, he wrote this novel during a time when he was regularly attending a weekly synagogue Torah study--an experience he describes in another book, The Gospel According to Moses. His exploration of Christian/Jewish relations is a distinctive feature and a highlight of this novel.In They Shall See God, Dickson portrays Christians and Jews with quite a range of viewpoints. These characters are sympathetically and perceptively presented. I found the book to be thought-provoking and deeply moving."
2,Decent,Ok book could have been a little more descriptive but all in all a good example of love. Jesus lives! :)
2,Too Slow,"I found myself skipping thru the pages, I just felt there were too many details, too many unessary words?? I was shaking my head while reading & my child was like ""why dont you just skip to the end"" I really wanted to give this book a chance but in the end I ended up skipping to the end..."
4,Good religious study,"It took a little while to get into. Each segment seemed to be about different people, but it finally pulled them all together and how they connected was interested. It was a good study in religion and realizing there are similarities in several religions and to be open to other points of view."
5,Age old tensions,"I chose to read this book based on the powerful 5-star reviews....and you all were right!! This mystery is cleverly entwined with the age old friction of Jewish vs Christian beliefs mixed with guilt and hatred. The author cleverly lets the reader know who the killer is but never reveals his motive and intentions until you peel off each layer of the characters to get to the heart of the matter. Regardless of religion, this book is not preachy nor does the author favor one over the other. Instead it's about understanding, patience and love. It's about the love of God...both true worship and fanatical, of sins both past and present, of forgiveness of ourselves and others, of acceptance of our flaws. I've never read anything like this book and it sent me to my childhood when in my innocence I asked my Jewish neighbor and friend why didn't she believe in Jesus. The female characters could have been us. Enjoy the journey of this book, it's a page turner and great thriller!"
5,Intriguing read!,Kept me in the story until I finished it! Very well written. Didn't see the twist at the end and thoroughly enjoyed it! :0)
3,Interesting,Not my kind of reading....But an interesting read....Just too many people with problems......could have used a character with more reality.
5,ENDORSEMENT,"If you like chiller-diller horror stories with a powerful redeeming edge, this is for you! A kaleidoscope of clearly defined characters, hamstrung by issues of the heart, face resurfaced childhood friends, old friends dying, gentle men locked away in mental wards, a convicted murderer released from prison, and wild animals roaming their Louisiana city. And a chilling study inside the tortured reasoning of a religious, calculating, twisted mind that's convinced he's doing the holy will of God. Keenly written, but not easy, comfortable reading. Hang on to the end to find out what it all means."
3,Falls short of promise,"I really enjoyed the first book, and didn't feel like it was really Young Adult aside from its lack of profanity/sex. But this 2nd book mostly fell short of the potential I felt it had. I think my basic problems with it were how the author choose to just ignore basic military practice and common sense in key places that left me annoyed to distraction.I believe he did this both to limit the overall scope of the plot and to stay focused on character drama. One big example early in the book (that was hard to ignore all the way through) was sending one, single ship on a priority mission...when we know from the 1st book that there is an entire advance Rustie fleet out there. This silliness continues all the way to the last page, where the main character does something so stupid with his son and car, it just left a bad taste.Still gave it a 3...it was OK, it was definately YA, and it was last I'll read in this series (if there's more)"
5,Best flight sim!,"This is the flight sim to beat! The planes, aerodynamic effects, sound, all are so well integrated that you feel like a real WW2 pilot. Just a note: buy a joystick to fully appreciate this flight sim."
3,good and bad,"the graphics in this game are truly amazing. and if you have a high end computer and like to dogfight 4 versus 4 it is great. the flight models are good, with a strong russian bias however. But if you want to have lots of ground activity and lots of planes in the air, forget it this game cannot handle this without stuttering and the screen becoming a slide show. And I have an excellent high end computer! The sound in the game is terrible. Much static and problems. Offline campaign is terrible. It really is an on line game. Having said all that, you should buy it. The graphics are stunning and the flight models are good. Just for this it is worth the money."
5,Awesome Game,"Damn, this game is incredible. Even if you rev your engine, the plane will rotate a bit from the torque. Try to learn how to recover from stalls on all the different models, then learn to recover the ME-109. It ain't easy but once you recognize how your plane of choice acts when it's about to stall, you can pull aerial maneuvers that really ride the edge of the aircraft's ability. I guess that's where 'flying by the seat of your pants' comes from. This game is just overall unbelievable. It's hard to imagine how people used to actually fly and fight in these things considering the difficulty of just getting up and landing, nevermind combat."
4,good game,"I am not too much of a sim fan but this game is really good. The graphics are beautiful on the higher settings (machine gun shells spill from under your fuselage, vapor trails from wingtips at high altitude, the clouds are amazing, starry night skies etc..) and the many choices of viewpoints are cool as well as very helpful. I am not giving it 5 stars because of the annoyingly LONG and BORING flights to and from the target areas. I know this is a realism thing but it really hurts the gameplay. I have put the game on 8x speed, gone and get something to eat, and come back after five minutes and I'm still not there! Otherwise, this is a must have for all you simmers. Real super fun."
5,best WW2 sim ever!!!,"This I have to say is the best WW2 sim that I ever played. The highlights of this game is the startling realistic detailed graphics. For example, you see the dust behind the tanks when they are moving and the detailed ground targets and cities. The planes are also very detailed. The flight model is more involved than other sims. Sometimes, when your plane is shot you continue to fly but the speed is less from the damage, etc. The rockets and cannons are a challenge to use also. From what I can see, the only negative aspect is the lack of a dynamic campaign. But because of all the other positive aspects of the game, the game is still a winner all the way. I would recommend the game to anybody who wants a realistic, WW2 game which has great graphics."
1,Doesn't work,"Maybe it's just the game is too old for my computer, but it doesn't work. Loaded upside down, and in black and white. Lousy graphics from what I could tell, even if it were in color. Microsoft Combat Simulator WWII Europe Series works just fine on this computer even though it's an old game like IL 2."
1,poor software,no good on xp and nivida video card no help on there web site im not planing to change my computer for it they can say what they want about microsoft but there products always work for me
2,A Boring Experience,"I've tried this game a number of times, but the most exciting thing I've done so far is crash. I diligently follow all the headings and altitudes but never seem to be able to find the enemy. So I just fly, and fly and fly, look at the clouds, get tired of it and quit the game. What game? I am looking forward to Combat Flight Simulator 3."
3,WW2 FIGHTERS SPOILED ME!,"I really dislike negative reviews so will not knock sturmovik, but having really tried almost every flight sim on the mkt. and there are many, I simply cannot find one as realistic as ww2fighters=the graphics and special effects are awesome=If you can find this game you will be amazed at the conrol of the aircraft, special effects and the wonderful graphics=ten times better than any flight sim available=If you have not tried it you are missing the ultimate! You might locate it at amazon.com's third party sellers as a used item=Its simple a wonderful game!"
5,Its almost real.....,This is a true combat flight sim. If you have the ram and the video card for this game it will feel and look real. This has some fantasic weather too. I have a very fast computer with the top Gforce card and I run it on XP home. It is a great game to play.
3,I am not saying it is a bad game......,"I got this game the other day, I had looked at it when it first came out and wanted to wait a little time for any bugs to be taken care of. I will come out and say this first, the website and updates are great. For a game that is a little ""old"" the community is great, and the fixes and updates are very active.The looks to the game are great. It is a higher end game so if your running anything under 800 you might not get a real good idea. One thing that does bother me, it does get a bit boring to play. Yes shooting at stuff and taking out planes or ground targets is fun, but after a while getting to where you need to go can be long and very boring.The sounds are great in game, I do get a few odd delays but that is far from a complaint. The idea that you can make your own campains and quick missions is great, it does add alot to the game. I just think it has fallen a little short of what I was looking for."
5,Works Fine in Windows 7,"The only reason I'm posting this review is because Amazon lists the ""most helpful"" negative review as ""Doesn't work in Windows 7."" Well, that reviewer is dead wrong. It works fine in Windows 7. Do a Google search if you have more issues, but . . .Right click the exe -> Properties -> Compatibility tab -> Run this program in compatibility mode for: Windows XP SP 2 and Check ""Run as administrator."" If these items are grayed out, click the ""Change settings for all users button"" and then select Windows XP SP 2 and check ""Run as administrator.""This game is great fun, as can be seen in the other reviews. Just because some e-b00b on Amazon says something is so don't make it so."
3,"Good book, but not great","This book gives fairly detailed descriptions of the most popular dive sites in Cozumel and adds a few pictures to each description. As a resource book that would help you plan or preview your dive, it is not very useful. I found it too verbose and lacking the kind of detail I was looking for.There is another book I have seen in dive shops that has a schematic view of each reef; the possible dive plans in each reef are detailed with color lines. That book would have been more useful in helping me understand the topography and various depths of each dive site."
2,too much analysis -- too little geometry,"This book delivers lots of analysis for those who want it, butdo not look here for geometrical insight into advanced calculusconcepts. For those of us who prefer to ""see the picture"", this book is a disappointment."
4,Helpful--made me feel better,"I purchased 3 suicide books when I went through my latest suicidal crisis--well, all right, maybe I'm still in it. This was the one which actually made me feel better. One book made me angry; one I still haven't read; this book pointed out to me that behind my mild-mannered exterior lies an intensely angry human being--someone I wasn't in touch with at all. This surprising insight alone was worth the price of the book. I can pick it up and read one of the short chapters inbetween my intensely stressful and busy life and it makes me feel better. Yes, I'm seeing a therapist; yes I'm seeking other forms of support; but I've added this book to my support system. I want it on tape!"
2,Not For The Truly Desperate,"I found this book disappointing. It might be okay for a person who is only slightly depressed. I actually laughed out loud when I got to the part where the author ""helpfully"" points out that there are suicide hotlines which are open. Ya think? Those hotline counselors are poorly trained although I am sure they mean well. I think they are mainly to call EMTs for life-threatening situations.This might be worth a read, but I do not recommend it for someone who has unsolvable, daunting problems. I feel the author trivializes people's crises, although he claims not to."
3,Odd book,"I ordered this book on an impulse because I was having a bad week. Most of the stuff the author says makes sense, but he presents it in a really strange fashion. It seems almost cynical to me and like he is trying to compare my own feelings to that of someone elses. The book did have some great points, like setting small goals for yourself, which can be helpful. This is an okay book if your looking for a little insight and maybe even a little hope if things aren't going too well, but I wouldn't recommend to someone who has had severe suicidal thoughts."
1,Patronizing Psycho-Babble,"I bought this book, hoping that it might offer me some intelligent and persuasive help, but was dismayed by its banal psycho-babble. It may be a helpful book for someone who is new to therapy or who is not struggling with agonizing circumstances, but not for the self-reflective or truly pained."
4,excellent,this is a very good working tool that could prevent someone from taking their own life. The fact that it is short and in easy to understand terms was an excellent decision by the author.
5,Thumb Up,Lay out of this book is awesome. It is very easy for readers to follow text and related drawings. Lots of good and useful information on Die Design and Metal Forming. I would indeed recommend this book to Students and Engineers that deal with Die design and Metal Forming. Thumb Up!
5,Excellent,"This is really great book! Useful mathematical equations, and numerous illustrations. Everything you need to know about sheet metal processing and die design in nice layout, that is easy to understand and follow. I'm glad I purchased this book."
5,Great book!,Great book. I would highly recommend it. I've used it as a reference for several of my own engineering projects. Excellent informative layouts from chapter to chapter. This book is a must if you are in sheet metal industry.
3,Sheet Metal Forming Processes and Die Design,"The book is a quick read with many useful tables and rule-of-thumb calculations. Mostly, I enjoyed reading it. However, there were so many editing errors that I became disillusioned. For example, at one point there was a reviewer's comment left in the printed text, ""I don't know what this means..."" I hope the author revises and reprints in the future."
5,"Punk/Goth/Emo version of ""On the Road""","I stayed up until I had finished this fabulous book as, having started it in the afternoon, I couldn't wait any longer to see how Lauren's adventures turned out.This book is on my life-changers list as reading Kate's take on our shared history in early 80s Bournemouth and at the Third Side Club has inspired me to finally get further than page 1 of the novel I've been telling myself I'll write for at least 20 years.Beyond the facts which I so fondly relate to, and as a voracious fiction reader I am also in love with Lauren and (most of) her family and friends and how, as usual, Kate draws you into the world which her characters inhabit and makes you care...enough to burn the midnight oil!I am totally in awe of Kate's ability to make the ordinary day-to-day of life intriguing and enchanting. I love this book and if you were part of the Punk/Goth scene first time around or an Emo currently, you will too."
1,Not impressed,"I picked up this book at a garage sale for 50 cents thinking that I couldn't beat the price. However, that is all the book is worth. It is basically the story of an English girl in the late 1970s and early 80s. Sure her life might be a little tough, but the book wasn't written in a way that you actually have pity for her. Basically, I came to the end wondering where the plot was."
1,"Isn't it illegal to use ""Art"" for a pile of ... well nothing","Seriously, when a computer guy sees the ""Art"" in the title he expects the ultimate quality, a definite word, a book which won't leave his shelf for decades. Not a rehersal of someone's colledge course with a bit of a name mangling game (servant interfaces anyone? :-) and artificial ""case studies"".This books simply lacks any insight, or coherence, even relevance. Looks like someone went collecting buzzwords, then went to beef up a list of references to get the appearence of academic-something and then embarked on writing a few paragraphs on all buzzwords, not even trying to be either a reference or a tutorial or a review work, or really anything.Reminded me of an old Fortran book which couldn't make heads or tails and went scattering one topic all over the place, but was official texbook so you had to read it."
4,Deep into Objects,"I borrowed a copy of this book to read during my business trip. It is a pretty well written book with in depth coverage of object design. You won't learn how to write codes here (the book kind of assume you know). But it certainly gives you all the essence of object programming. With it you can probably design better Java codes, or even C# codes in the future :) The architecture chapter is quite enjoyable too. I have recommended the book to my developers (also got a copy myself for reference)."
1,Not worth the money,"This book reads like an academic term paper; in other words, brief and boring, with many references to other works. Broad overviews are all you'll find. For example, the author devotes a mere five pages to discuss the XML document object; why did he bother?There are far, far better books for any and all of the topics covered. It is very annoying to spend $40 for a book, and immediately realize that you need to buy another book to get more information. I really don't see any practical use for this book."
1,Country Cats Toothbrush Holder,The holes in the holder are not deep enough to properly hold the brushes. The design is nice but it really is of no use as a toothbrush holder.
5,Kirk's Fire Investigation,"The chief god of fire investigation has spoken. DeHaan wrote a complete and through text about fire investigation. If you are serious about fire investigation, this is a must book in your library. It is a tough book in read. So, buy it and review it again and again."
4,Kirk's Fire Investigation 5th Edition,I needed to find an older edition of this text and was very glad to find one recently through Amazon.
5,DeHaan Does It Again,"The best fire investigation reference book on the market today. Thanks John.Mark HowellAIC-FireDenton, Texas"
3,thinking about visiting Sicily?,"Like Sicily itself, the short stories in The Wine Dark Sea connect the classical past with the quirky present of an island that was visited and changed by successive waves of conquerors and visitors. The stories evoke the uneasy relationship that Sicily has with the rest of Italy, the edginess of its residents' relationship with strngers. The stories are of uneven length and quality, and some are much more accomplished than others. They are tall on incident rather than on plot, and one wonders a bit whether something is lost in translation, as Sciascia is acclaimed in Sicily to a degree that seems disproportionate to some of these stories. He is no William Maxwell. But this is a good read for those wanting a sense of the tone of the place before a visit or the memory of it after one."
5,"Funny, intelligent and thought provoking","This book delivered invaluable information in an easy to read, thought provoking, funny, satirical manner while raising the red flag about our ""separation"" between church and state. If you care about what you see happening - the merging between the two, you have got to read this book.Thanks!"
4,An ice cold glass of fresh lemonade or a hot cup of spiced tea depending on the weather,"I was expecting the same hubgrub gripes about this and that, all of which I can never put much weight behind but I was really surprised to have an enjoyable, humorous and enlightening read. I was most appreciative of spiritual nature of the book which I don't think was the authors intent but that was my take. I have never considered Atheism a spiritual path but there are some really wonderful poems and hysterical social commentary that brought me peace and filled my heart with joy, which seem to be by-products of religious endeavors that last time I checked. Actually, the main point of the book is about separation of church and state. Kagin's presentation of this vital issue is quite poignant and convincing."
4,Freethinking and Humor?,"I consider myself one of the more fortunate people in Greater Cincinnati to have met Edwin Kagin. A character not to be be taken lightly that's for sure. But a character none the less. To his Helen I offer a hug and a sainthood. ""Baubles""........is part history lesson, part comedy sketch and part rallying cry. If you want to sit on your backside and let the religious right take over this country, go ahead, but don't complain. If you are like me you will read this book and become a part of the movement. Mr. Kagin started Camp Quest and that makes him a hero...He is tireless in his campaign for the secular cause and that makes him a human being with a heart. Buy this book, then read it and then write a review of your own and maybe even start a revolution of your own."
1,Doesn't fit 2G Nano,"Although clearly stated in Amazon's description as fitting both 1G and 2G Nanos, it doesn't fit 2G. Otherwise, it seemed to be constructed well, but I didn't get a chance to put it through its paces. It's going back."
4,Clayton02,"I like 80% of the songs chosen for this collection, which is pretty good considering there are 20 songs on the cd. I've been rockn' the music since Christmas as this was on my list of ""must haves""!"
2,Bo Diddley,"I was rather disappointed with this CD collection of Bo Diddley's work. Too many songs on it that I had never heard before, and did not care for."
5,BO Diddley CD,"It had been many years since I had heard BO Diddley and thought I would bring back a few memories. I am not sure what history he had with what record labels. This CD seem to have his real early recordings so I assume he later switched labels. There were some recordings that seemed to be missing and maybe they were later in his career. Overall if you wanted his early recordings I guess this is the one to buy. If you wanted recordings later in his career you may want to look further. This was definitely ""vintage"" Bo Diddley. He was one of a kind and was proud of it as he well should have been. Great misician."
5,the man,"his signature guitar sound and voice are timeless.i'm a man.pretty thing,road runner etc..these songs on this set are some of the most important songs in the history of music.think i'm lying? ask the Beatles,rolling stones,led zepplin,david bowie,the who&countless others.this is history.BO is the Man.And BO knows he is a genius."
1,Waste of money,"I planned to use this battery on my A2 camera but this junk can't hold a proper charge. The battery is dead in no time and unfortunately i bought 2 of them... Don't buy, it's a complete waste of money."
5,Under rated,"The negative reviews for this product may stem from the unclear instructions on inserting the battery into the charger. The charger has a spring loaded part that must be pushed in to accept the battery, which is then held in place ."
3,Argentine tango of a sort,"Most of these are medium Argentine tango tempos, and so danceable and useful for practice. I would give it a higher rating, but it is not really passionate. Hmm. Where is the good stuff?"
3,"Okay, not great","It's okay. I will continue to use what I have been using for years-DOVE. Dove is one of the least expensive shampoos and conditioners on the market. But I have found that it works as well, or better, than any of these high-priced products."
4,"Love It, Don't Leave It","I love this product. I had this and the mixed chicks conditioner in my hand when the clerk came over and said get the Phillip B, well I did and I love it. I have been able to eliminate some of my other products and now use a cocktail of this and cat walk curls rock curl amplifier. My hair never looks or feels crunchy and I get tons of compliments. People who don't know me think my curls are done by a salon. I have wavy, ringlet-y curls. My hair is also heavily highlighted, this product makes my hair feel like silk. Looking forward to trying more in this line. I do agree it doesn't smell great, but that disappears immediately."
3,"Not the most interesting story, but worth reading.","Read this recently and, for the most part, liked it. Don't expect anything riveting, or on-the-edge-of-your-seat. It is a good story dealing with Eric Smith's experience as a junior leader, the product of Army ROTC at Georgetown University. Smith gains a slot to the Army's military intelligence arm, something highly sought after among ROTC graduates. The story is a brief memoir of Smith's experiences while stationed in Chu Lai. Not a bad book to read while on a long flight. Easy reading, but if you're interested in reading something exciting about Vietnam, recommend you read something else."
5,Monty Pythons's Life Of Brian- The Immaculate Edition (Blu-ray),"This I purchased for my husband he just loves the Monty Python's Life Of Brian, nice to view on the Blu- ray, thought that gave the movie a special look with the nice clear picture, he was very happy with his gift from his dear wife!. Barbara Petersen. Australia."
5,Life of Brian,"I have seen this movie well over 125 times. Most of them at the cinema. I particularly loved the cartoon and travelogue that came with the cinema version. Yes, it slaps every convention we know in the face, plus pokes fun at organised anything, but it shows people up for how really SILLY they can be."
3,Life of Brian needs remastering,"Based on the movie content alone this DVD gets 3 stars. It loses 2 for looking and sounding quite drab. This is a movie desperately in need of a sound and especially video remastering. Since it is 20 years old and was very low budget this will probably never happen. I am basing this on the standard DVD, I have not seen the Criterion edition. I read EVERY review and found they are all given 5 stars based on the movie alone (which deserves it). But what about presentation? The Criterion reviews were obvious as they stated that there is commentary. For those who have seen both did Criterion use the same film transfer, or is it better other than just the extras? I would have bought the Criterion if I had known it was going to release 2 weeks after the standard one, I will only upgrade if the picture is better..."
1,No Subtitles or Close Captioning,Despite the fact that this is an awesome and humorous movie (The best monty python ever made). This gets a 1 from me for having no subtitles or close captioning since I am hard of hearing. Are there any versions with subtitles??
4,Hilarious movie!,"Truly a classic, though beware of nudity (there's a naked Graham Chapman for a brief moment!)"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Despite a solid premise, Life of Brian consists mainly of uninspired stretches of comedy that stretch on too long in an attempt to milk every joke for all they're worth."
2,"meh, this seems like its more hype than anything.","I would have to say I love Monty Python, but this has be the least funny of the 3 movies. Wheres the wit? Wheres the exaggeration? wheres the low blows? the movie feels like a bad episode of Family Guy where the tired out the jokes are repeated. The characters were not believable either. what happen to the social commentary? while it does poke at religion, the jokes seem more stereotypical than smart (wheres the history lesson?). Was the joke about the nose poking at the Jews or was it just a bit they stuck in? It seems like they got all the right elements for a super funny movie, but they decided not to refine it. Maybe the movie was just still too PC and not offensive enough to be funny."
4,Life of Brian,"Ar first I have to say that I'm also catholic and I believe in God as much as in the church. But the film is a parody. It makes fun of things I believe in. At first I was shocked to watch this movie but later on I have to laugh with all students. I realize that it doesn't makes fun of God it makes fun of people who trust the church or are depended on other religions blindely. People, who don't recognize some lies of the bible, who don't have an opinion and only do what they are supposed to because it's much easier. The film opened my eyes and maybe you want that also your eyes were opened.E.T"
4,The Life of Brian: Politics as Usual,"""The Life of Brian"" is one of the most brillant comedies ever created (I would list ""This is Spinal Tap"" a close second). The Pythons' best work by far. While the movie presents clever satire of religious fanaticism, it much stronger in satirizing political fanaticism and hypocrisy: and the two themes never meet in this movie. The People's Front of Judea wants Brian because he hates the Romans ""a lot,"" NOT because they believe he is the Messiah. Still they are the ones who show up at the crucifixion. The parallel plot strains stress the often random nature of life events. In the end, it's the political satire that puts this movie ahead of its peers. To understand the genius of the political satire, I suggest that you join an underground political movement, and then watch the movie again with fresh eyes."
4,"Great movie , classic comedy","This is a classic comedy , full of sarcarsm and funny dialogue.All the group in python are in their best , this one is the best of their three movies for sure."
5,A Classic.,This is my favourite movie of all time. The punch lines are endless and tears of laughter will run down your cheeks. Buy it!
3,"Not Pythons' best, but pretty funny stuff!","The problem with this film is that it is a roller coaster ride of hysterically funny moments surrounded by a whole lot of non-funny moments. Instead of showing the whole film to my friends, I often fast-forward the film to the stoning scene, and every scene featuring Michael Palin as a stuttering Pontious Pilate, ""Releath Thimon the Thagetariouth Thlayer!"""
4,A Spoof on Religion,"At the time this movie was made, no one was really to provide financing for the project. Thankfully, one of the ""Beatles"" put up the money. It is great humor."
3,Python review/heavy handed mail carriers,"Although I don't believe it's the fault of the person I purchased it from, I did find my DVD case to have a dent in it as if someone from the post office stepped on it. And I mean hard. Fortunately the disc was undamaged and it's all good. Thanks again. Love Monty Python."
3,Not my favorite Monty Python,"As a HUGE fan of Monty Python and someone who has been watching the movies and shows since I was 6, I feel somewhat disappointed in this film. It felt like it was very slow and the funny was few and far between. I fully expect people to disagree with my OPINION. Of course there are certain parts that I love, but on the whole, it's just not my fave. So there."
5,Follow the Gourd,"Those things that are your most sacred are the things that you should burn! A very smart person said that and this movie may be a prime indicator that it is a good tenent to follow. For those one star - stay away from this reviewers, 'follow the sandal! follow the sandal! Blind faith is still blind."
5,A classic,"When the pythons were writing this classic, they wanted to run it 2 and a half hours long and have an intermission in the middle. Folks, this Criterion edition is as close as your getting to that. it has five additonal scenes such as the crack suicide squad and the three wise men around the fire talking about how they love sheep. ABsoutley hilaruos----- BUY IT!"
4,"Great, but...","Excellent movie, truly worthy of the Python name, but falls short of the Holy Grail. Can be rather slow at times, but mostly hilarious. If it wasn't for what I think of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, I'd gladly give this movie five stars."
4,My mother once called me a heathen,"M.P. pulls it off! There should be more of this type of movie out there for the masses to viddy. How shall I f.o., my lord?"
2,"Not technically blasphemous, but ...","The people who defend this film on the grounds it is not blasphemous or condemn it on the grounds that it is blasphemous both miss the point. Christ is portrated quite respectfully but it is nevertheless an attack on religion and particularly on Christianity. It covers itself from outright blasphemy by subtle, lawyer-like strategems but, nevertheless, if you think Christiainty is a force for good in the world it is enemy work, part of the cheap, smart low-mindedness which seems a predominant feature of modern culture.The space-battle scene is hilarious."
5,Monty Python's Life Of Brian - The Immaculate Edition,"I had an old vcr tape of ""Monty Python's Life Of Brian"" and it was getting old and near the end of its' life so I decided to buy a DVD. I got it on time in good condition and would use this company again if the price it right."
4,Entertaining,I purchased this item for a friends birthday present as it was something they had always wanted to own
5,Masterpiece,"This is what Monty Python will be remembered for in the future - their most sustained, coherent work, and one that is staggeringly funny and very very powerful in its message. Those who didn't see it, and protested anyway, were only improving the film by giving proof that its central theme of the stupidity of blind faith (and I'm sorry you religious Python fans - but that IS the point of this movie - it is a powerful atheist tract) was 100% accurate.Fantatic piece of work. immensely funny, Graham Chapman's finest hour."
1,Absoluteley shocking filthy,As I red through the five star reviews of this shocking film a could'nt beleive that person's can be so insensitive to the real story of Christ. It really made me weep and outraged. It was also very dirty and discusting. I looked at the seens of nudity many times and each time I got madder.This film should be banned and burnt.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"THIS ONE'S A LOSER. IF YOU WANT TO THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY, TOSS IT OFF A BRIDGE. THE MOVIE ATTEMPTS TO BE FUNNY BUT THE WORDS ARE HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND IT IS MINDLESS, BRAINLESS GIBBERISH."
1,Overrated and incredibly blasephemous,"To call this overrated Monty Python spinoff blasephemous may be an understatement. In reality, it is anti-religious, and that is the most offensive of all the cardinals sins. Stay far away from ""Brian"""
4,Funny spoof.,"The ""Life of Brian"" is a great spoof on life in ancient Judea under roman occupation. it is not really a religious satire as so many people seem to think. I would defiantly recommend it to anyone who likes the Python's style of humor."
4,Python Classic...Irreverent and hilarious,"One of Monty Python's best films. Poor Brian doesn't want to be a savior but his followers won't leave him alone, and his own mother won't give him any respect. Lots of laughs throughout. I know some who don't like it because of their deep religious beliefs, but I don't see any conflict. In my opinion it's just a funny film that takes satirical jabs at blind worship of any kind; religious, celebrity, or whatever"
4,Monty Python's Life of Brian,"A little less funny than when I saw it many years ago when if first came out and I had tears and belly aches from the laughter, but it's still a riot."
4,almost the funniest movie ever,"The more controversy this movie caused, the more my mom didn't want me to see it--well obviously I just had to go see it. now, since I'm blind, I couldn't drive myself to the movie, and didn't have cab fare. so my sister took me. I spent the whole movie laughing like mad. She spent it saying ""When do I laugh?"" my wife says much the same, since her parents bought me the DVD for Christmas. there's no way to make anybody but an afficionado see what's so screamingly funny about this movie. It's better than their other movie, ""Holy Grail,""--and that was a darn good flick! and how do you not like the closing song, ""Always Look on the bright side of life."" I try to remember, after a brutal work week, that ""Life's a piece of s--t, when you look at it,"" as Eric Idle sings in the song. this is money well spent."
1,Absurd,"If you like to see people playing around with theology this might be the book for you. But if you hate to see people wading in over their heads, stay clear.This is very disappointing work. Although the author makes dramatic claims to being a theologian, his writing actually betrays him as a novice.I can see why this book was not published by a major, reputable publisher: it is absurd through and through. Read some of the reviews below to get a sense of the disappointing argument of this book.Noe actually believes Christ's second coming was in the first century, that earth history will NEVER end (in fact, this seems to be a major point of this book), that Christians should not expect a future resurrection from the dead, and many other errors.If you are looking for helpful material on prophetic issues, look somewhere else."
1,Strange doctrine,"This was an alarming book promoting some strange doctrines. Mr. Noe believes the earth will last forever and that Jesus returned invisibly in his Second Advent in A.D. 70.He also believes that this complex of new doctrines is helping to establish a ""New Reformation."" He believes that Christianity has been mistaken about the basic doctrines of the Bible for 2000 years.And he sets himself before as one who can straighten things out. If this is what Christian doctrine is all about, I don't want any part of it.We have too many ""prophecy experts"" among us. Away with this man. We will not have him to reign over us! After reading Noe, Tim LaHaye seems to make sense (but only by comparison).I would pass on this volume."
1,Naive book,"This book is one of the most naive and silly attempts at theology that I have ever read. The author stumbles over biblical theology while attempting to thrash out a new theology.The Hyper-Preterism he represents believes the earth is everlasting, the second coming of Christ has already occurred, Christians will not be physically resurrected, and more!He recommends having a new holy day: in September to celebrate the destruction of the Jewish temple.Steer clear of this hodge-podge of would-be theology. I recommend Keith Mathison's ""When Shall These Things Be?"" as an antidote to the strange doctrines promoted in Noe's book. R. C. Sprouls' ""The Last Days According to Jesus"" also corrects the excesses of this new theology."
2,Well...,I can't read fast card with this reader. Remember to format your card before first use - if not very likely it wont be readeble.
1,ggrrrr....,"okay, so installed it, connected it, transferred some pictures from it, all was okay. then when i clicked on the icon to ""safely remove"" it, it kept saying that it was busy or there was an error and try again later. so i did. 2 hours later and the same thing happened. i didnt know what to do really, if i pulled it out it might mess up my SD card, if it didn't, well how am i gonna get my card? so i just pulled out the card and proceeded to removing it again, same thing happened. fed up i just pulled it out, restarted the computer and tried again. same thing! whats wrong with this stupid card reader? its gonna mess up my SD! can anyone help or tell me if they've had the same problems?"
1,Wrong item for what I needed!,"What I wanted was a ""Memory Card Reader/Writer"" for alldigital Cameras.Can't use one , was going to give as a gift, had to buy something else."
1,"Worked GREAT, until it STOPPED!","The first two weeks that I had it, it worked marvelously. Now, I am back on Amazon to buy ANOTHER card reader because it stopped reading the memory card. Such a pain and I would not want this to happen to anyone else. Of course, because the product is under $20, I trashed the box it came in (with warranty). Moral of my story - buy at your own risk and if you do, KEEP THE BOX IT COMES IN!"
5,This item is the bomb!,"I recently purchased this wonderful reader about a couple of months ago. I opened the box and plugged it in. I didn't realize how easy it is to use. You push the button on top and a window pops up, then you select transfer images and select a folder then you are pretty much done. It's that simple! I was amazed by this product and I payed $19.99 at Best Buy for it. I RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE."
1,This product does not last more than a year.,This product does not last more than a year. All of a sudden the imagemate 5 in 1 quit working for me. I attempted to troubleshoot several issues I thought it might be having but in the end I will just be trashing it and buying something esle.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT
1,Buy Something Else,"Unless you are still running Win98, forget about this piece of junk. Plugged it into a Vista desktop and it worked for about 10 minutes and then died."
4,review Sandisk reader,The sandisk SDDR99 is a very good product and does it's job very well. It's fast and takes all types of chips.
2,"Not for Mac, not 5 in 1","I have owned this card reader for some time now, haven't been able to find out how to insert any other than SD cards yet, I don't know what 5 in 1 refers to! As far as connectivity goes, PC is fine but Mac has serious problems, since I'm primarily a Mac user, the reader is mainly useless to me, I have to plug and unplug it to my USB port, restart my Mac, plug and unplug the cord to the device until finally it sometimes works. It's a software issue since one of my Macs has bootcamp installed and when running Windows it works always."
3,Ordered wrong,I unfortunately ordered the wrong product. I have a version of this that reads CF cards and assumed this version which reads more than one type of card would also read CF cards. My fault for not reading the fine print. The good news is that Jowow was willing to take back the items even though I had opened one package. I am very pleased with the service but disappointed I can't seem to find a SanDisk reader like this for CF cards.
2,Sandisk Reader/Writer,"Can not use on any pc, such as a public library pc. Must have software download on a jump stick and hope you can download it to pc to use product fully."
1,Piece of Junk,"Watching paint dry is far faster than this unit downloading images.It only worked for the 2 reads from a Sansdisk Extreme III SD card.Now even though the little green light goes on, the card does not even register at all.Now I have to tie-up my DSLR to download the images.It's a waste of money."
4,"nice reader,lacks a dust cover",the reader and software are very good.should have a dustcap over the reader slot;easily solved with some tape.
3,not the fastest reader.,"With a Sandisk Extreme III 8GB 30MB/sec SDHC card, I am only able to achieve 12MB/sec write speed and 19MB/sec read speed with this reader.I would recommend that you go with the newer SDDR-199-A20 card reader. RW benchmarks can be found here:http://www.legitreviews.com/article/931/2/"
3,Some minor conflicts,"I purchased the Sandisk card and the reader/writer. I am not sure which item is not working, but I have to insert the card and extract it many times to get it to read the card. Once the device see's the card I have no problems downloading or uploading. I have no problem with the phone reading the card, so I speculate the SDDR-99 is not working the way it is suppose to. But that is all I have to say. It is convenient to download music to and then play it on my phone. Pictures too."
1,San Disk mukticard reader.,"Terrible product. worked two days, then nothing. now I use my printer card reader and that is great. Sorry I bought it."
3,Not the item purchased,I put in the part number of the item i need which open the larger Sandisk card. I need to know how to return these items for the correct reader. This is a very important item that we use in the Sheriff's Office vehicles when we are recording and for our cases. Your assistance's is greatly appreciated to expedite getting these items exchanged.
4,one of the few that supports xD cards,"didnt have to install drivers. only complaint i have is that when inserting an XD card, you have no feedback if its already inserted far enough. i guess that is the problem with most multi-card reader using one slot only."
4,ok,EL PEDIDO LLEGO DENTRO DE LOS LIMITES DE TIEMPO ESPECIFICADOS..ESTOY PLENAMENTE SATISFECHO DE ESTA COMPRA.
4,works great-very fast way to move pictures,"I wish I had discovered this device earlier. It really takes a lot of frustration out of moving pictures from camera to computer. It's a much, much faster transfer. My only (minor)complaint is that at least on my computer, I can't shut it it down from the system tray using the little ""safely remove hardware"" icon. But after I've cleaned off an SD card, it probably wouldn't hurt to just remove the device without going through the steps. Just to be safe, I usually leave the reader plugged in until I shut down the computer itself."
5,"great, but did not need it","I love it. It is not as compact as the previous one I used, but it seems to be a bit faster."
4,a best_seller,"mostley a book/game. and a adveture game. but im not sayin, its bad. most of the people say its a best seller it is a four star revew. i hurd about it on poptripa. you know you have to have a book to write in it. but its a fun filld adventure."
5,An expectingly moving film,"I came into the movie not expecting anything, and perhaps this is what made the experience surprising for me. The movie was moving, and it this by dealing with the profound subject matters of the fate we have in this life, and the faith that everything will work out."
2,what the heck did i just watch?,"Overall this movie was terrible.... but it did have beautiful scenery. There were some good messages about God and some sweet parts where the boy interacted with his sisters and grandmother, but still this was awful."
5,Cinema at its FINEST!,"This film is a source of relief in an era in which popular cinema is full of meaningless fluff and artsy films tend to focus on bizzare elements of sexuality.The film is in Farsi (with english subtitles), but regardless of the language you understand, this film will speak to your heart. It is a timeless tale of spiritual testing and toil - of a search for meaning and redemption. The film deals a lot with the issue of 'opposites', which is imbedded in Islamic tradition, such as in the poems of Rumi.In addition, the film represents the spirit of a faith, Islam, that is not represented by the Western media. Rather than watching ""Not Without My Daughter"" or reading ""The Princess"", your time will be much better spent checking this film out."
5,Best foreign movie I've seen,This is the best foreign film that I've ever seen. Beautiful scenery defies expecations. The simplicity of the scenery and acting makes the film even more powerful. This film will leave you talking about its story for a while.
5,One of the best,This is one of the best movies I've seen. Majid Majidi is at his best once again. The cinematography is supurb. I wish I had seen it in the theather. The acting is wonderful. I don't think anyone can watch this movie without shedding a tear.
3,Interesting movie,Interesting movie depicting less known aspects of life in Iran. Gorgeous cinematography.The movie is very slowly paced and the story rather simple.
2,Initial release is very unstable,"Just a word to the wise, the initial release is very unstable. The forums are currently clogged with gamers having difficulties with everything from the installation through game play. It has been three days since I purchased the product, and have yet to play one game due to game crashes. So far UbiSoft and RSE technical support have yet to significantly address the issues.It looks like a great game and I can't wait to play...but at this point I might wait to see if the manufacturers will address the reliability problems.Just thought you shold know."
4,Ghost Recon,"Probably one of the most intense shooters i've ever played besides Halo 2, but it sticks out there in 2nd place for shooters in my favorite list. You shooter lovers should try it out."
5,Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon,"Excellent game. First game I tried on computer and it's better than the Playstation 2, game. A must for a beginner or a veteram."
3,Easy easy easy,"Now I'm not one to complain but, umm shouldn't this game be difficult? I have had this game about two weeks and played about an hour a day three days out of the twoo weeks. Sad thing is, I have finished my missions. I played this game on veteran mode and found only two of the levels challenging. Most were short and simple. This was sadly disappointing especially because this is one of two shooter games I own and the other is on Xbox. Shouldn't I be challenged more because of my inexperiance with the type of games? Apparentaly not. Although the game was fun and the graphics decent. I only give 3 stars for it being highly unchallenging and short."
1,sucky,"first of all I hated this game. I got this game and was so eager to play ,being an FPS fan.GRAPHICS: Okay the graphics are so blocky it looks like a ps1 game gone horribly wrong. The trees are basicaly shaped like this(+) colored different shades of green. Just a sample of the pictures in this game.GAMEPLAY:The controls in this game are very clumsy to FPS fans. (reload=z, change weps=`, run =right mouse). The friendly AI in this game will stand there until you tell them to move, even while taking fire! The enemy has a serious advantage in this game because if you get shot once you you wil lose control of your guy so they can shoot you again, in an endles cycle until you die because the have full auto weapons.OVERALL: This game sucks. Seriously if your contemplating between this and another game, pick the other one!"
1,... Game,...This game is absolutely horrible. The playabilty is poor and the graphics are barely mediocre. Don't waste your money ...
3,Was this rushed?,"I love Operation Flashpoint and Hidden and Dangerous. I love FPS in general as well. I was looking forward to this game as I enjoy soldier based tactical simulations. However, its closest cousin is SWAT 3 and that is a far better game.Don't get me wrong, this is a good game but not a great game. The soldier models are excellent and the sound effects are the best I've heard for the weapons. But it is not too hard and I completed it on recruit in two nights only. The AI is rather basic and your soldiers are annoyingly dumb even with a full points bar. I'm sure die hard fans will lap it up but I think it was a slight waste of my 30.00.Could do better."
3,Not bad,"I'm all about strategy in FPS's, I play on a Tribes2 ladder and so far no game, including GR has come close to T2 in balance, gameplay, strategy, graphics and fun. Here's the thing: too much realism isn't necessarily a good thing. A hit to the chest or head from a 7.62mm, .223, .45 - it doesn't matter, you DIE! Maybe FPS should be a little fantasy oriented. I mean, Juggernaut armor CAN resist a fusion mortar hit at close range I've seen it happen :)Take my adivice, upgrade your system to at least match mine (TBird1.4,GF3,SBLive,Klipsch etc) get some broadband, and play some Tribes2."
1,Its nothing compaired to Operation Flashpoint...,"I have all the rainbow six games, and I think this is a stumbling attempt to create a battlefiel war game. I think it was stupid of Ubi and Red Storm to put somthing this pitiful out there with operation flashpoint out... Its good if you like the rainbow six series, but if you want somthing a little better, go for operation flashpoint."
1,Would like to know how good this game is.....,"Order placed Nov,6/01. Product released Nov.13/01. Estimated shipping date Nov,14/01. Estimated delivery Nov19-24/01. Package not yet shipped as of Nov,20/01. Guess it pays to go to Best Buy. Demo of this game is AWESOME!! Release version worth the wait?.........CAN'T BE!!!! May be my first/last online purchase."
3,Great game!,But read the h/w requirements carefully. I had an ATI Rage Pro and the game just crawled until I lowered the video res and details. Good fun though.
4,krimenie,"Awesome, as real as it gets with out getting hurt.I would like to see more weapons that SF uses however.A lot of fun. Great first person shooter game."
5,Great gameplay and graphics! A nice challange!,"This was a great game! I was impressed with the realistic gameplay! I have beaten the game on recruit, and the veteran and elite settings are much harder! Also a very fun multiplayer mode!"
2,"Great ideas, [poor] graphics","I love what Ghost Recon wants to be--a thoroughly realistic military simulation first person shooter. But the graphics (particularly for environment) are unacceptably poor, even archaic by most standards. heavy pixelation, poorly designed and applied textures, and chunky modelling blend to form a GUI that is both tiresome to look at and difficult to use. Which is sad because this game should be the standard for realism by which other FPS games are judged. Instead, it's hard to take it seriously."
4,Great fun suffers because of kit restrictions,"This game is a lot of fun, and is excellent when it comes to sound, graphics, and gameplay. The only problem is that you are only allowed 1 weapon and 1 item, where as in Rogue Spear you are allowed 1 weapon, a secondary weapon, and 2 items. Also, if you run out of ammo, which is unlikely but possible, you cannot pick up dead soldiers' weapons. Your man becomes helpless.But I've been dwelling on the bad part of this game. This really is one of the best games I've ever played and is well worth the price, especially for the internet play."
1,VooDoo Owners Need not apply.,"If you own a 3DFX VooDoo video board, you should not buy this game.This game may be fun, but that only counts if it runs and you can see it. As it stands right now this game does NOT support the VooDoo series of video cards therefore; the game won't start, will crash, or at the very best you won't be able to read the menus or use night vision in the game.(. . .)P>I cannot say if this game is fun or not, but I'll be returning my copy because it does not work and of the non-existent support from Ubi Software."
1,Pathetic,"The reviews said this is good, but I must've missed something in the tutorial. I thought the soldiers were supposed to fire on their own? It's very realistic, but I apparently failed to get the fun of the game.If anyone can advise me on this, please comment."
4,"Fun game, but very tough","This is a game for people with a lot of patience. No charging through levels and beating it the first time. More like attempting the same level a dozen times before getting it perfect (for me anyway). And since your guys die from a single gunshot most of the time, getting it perfect is pretty much required. You can make it through levels having lost some of the team members, but since the guys aquire skills with each level passed, letting them get killed off is out of the question for me."
5,Great military sim!!!,"This game is amazing! I just bought it a couple days ago and just got it in the mail yesterday! Last night I popped the disc in the drive and installed the game with no problems. Once I started playing the game I decided to bump up the graphics a little bit. I will admit the graphics are a little dated but if you can get past that this game is awesome! The first level is really hard! And its not hard because you know, there's a stupid glitch and the tango is shootin you through the walls. No, its hard becaue the AI is amazing on this game!! If the tango sees you first he will actually try to sneak up on you, not just stand in one position and wait to get picked off. For the price of the game it is a great deal. My only complaint is that the graphics are a little old. If your looking for a good, challenging military simulation game this is the one! And for only 1.78, its a great deal!!!"
5,Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon,"While i enjoyed the multiplayer of Rainbow Six i hated the single player which was nearly impossible due to lack of save games. Ghost Recon has full save games. Good and bad. Good, you can save anywhere. Bad, makes the game quite linear. The gameplay is amazing with excellent level design, graphics and sound effects. Ghost Recon is a very realistic game. You can only carry two weapons and a single gun shot can kill you or wound you badly. The biggest problem is that the main menu is at low resolution and the movies do not play sometimes. When i played at 640x480 i can view the movie cutsence but at higer resolution i don't sometimes. I did not have anyother problems beside that. Ghost Recon is a must if you like stealth shooters."
5,Awesome.,"I was very impressed with the sound, the noise of automatic gunfire is just dead on target, to the point that I can actually tell whether a shot was fired by a team member or a soviet soldier by sound of the weapon. Sound usually doesn't add or subtract much from a game for me (unless it's absolutely atrocious), but hearing the quiet of the outdoors suddenly shattered by automatic weapons fire brought to bear on an unknowing column of soldiers is a huge rush."
5,GR Rocks!!,"After spending too much time with Counter-Strike, Ghost Recon was a nice change. Some have complained about the ""good-guy"" AI not being that great. It doesn't bother me. I'm more concerned about the enemy AI and if they're going to put up a good fight or not. If you want some serious realism and some tough single-player action, Ghost Recon delivers!"
4,Good But........,"Don't get me wrong it's an sweet game, but the weapons selsction is very poor. You can unlock more weapons, but it would have been better with them already unlocked (the players). Other than that is is almost the same as the other Tom Clancy games."
4,"Awesome game, a challenge","This game is one of the best I have ever played!!!! I highly recommend it to anyone who wants it. Buy this game!!!! The graphics are great, the sounds better, and the default controls are good too! Also it has good replay value!There are a few problems though. For one sometimes (rarely) your men will walk in front of each other and kill themselves. Also the grenades dont work very well. But I still recommend it!"
5,Played all the way through......twice!,"Wow. This is definitely the best FPS I've ever played. Realism, free-roaming, accurate weapon depictions (I love the OICW). Can't wait for the expansion(s).Just one question. Hasn't the Army ever heard of a semiautomatic sniper rifle?"
5,The drummer's bible for Afro-Cuban music,This video covers the essentials of Afro-Cuban music. What makes this instructional video so useful is that a world class musician takes the time to teach the fundamentals of Afro-Cuban drumming without trying to impress the viewer with his chops. This is a real INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO. Thanks God for that!!!!
4,"""power in a Jagger-Richards song""","There is simply a unique and quite recognizable power in a Jagger-Richards song that can't be denied. This compilation is a tribute to this pair's songwriting genius, fourteen songs appear on this album, with some of the most talented artists perforing their work.A few stand outs - ""NO EXPECTATIONS"" (Johnny Cash) with his ""Folsom Prison Blues"" tempo, is really different and entertaining - ""TUMBLING DICE"" (Linda Ronstadt) does real well with her distinctive style - ""BROWN SUGAR"" (Little Richard) high-voltage approach is simply electrifying.This is not just a toe-tapping CD, but pure energy one must experience if you're a Rolling Stone fan. Highly recommend this to all ages, a major surprise, a must buy for the young and old music fan!Total Time: 57:27 on 14 Tracks/ Hip-O Records - HIPD 40078 (1998)"
2,Not what I expected,"Quite disappointed with this album. Although the artists are all top notch, the renditions are poor at best. Aretha's should have been a gospel flavor, not the disco beat used. By listend to many of the tracks, I would guess that they were recorded in the late seventies."
3,Ha podido ser mejor,"Cuando observas el tracklisting del disco, crees que el disco es una maravilla, pero escuharlo es una cosa diferente. La mayoria de las versiones contienen el sello original de los artistas que la interpretan. Lo mejor del disco: ""19th nervous brakdown"" (vale el disco), la versión de ""Tumbling Dice"" de Linda Ronstand, ""Gimme Shelter"" y ""Jumping Jack Flash"" (magistral), del resto nada que resaltar. Éste disco no es para ti si no eres un verdadero fanático de los Stones"
5,Wonderful Introduction To Model Railroading,"Well built, rugged and extremely easy to assemble. You can be ""on the rail"" within 5 minutes of opening the box! Not complicated, very smooth controller and locomotive.Would certainly recommed this set to anyone who would like to experience, at a reasonable cost, model railroading."
2,not very well made,"i expected better from bachmann because i own other products from this company. the wheels on the freight car fell off as i took it out of the box, and there were only the front wheels on the caboose.it may sound petty but for the price it should at least stay in one piece until it goes around the track a few times."
1,Wheels came off taking the cars out of the box,I echo the comments of the other reviewer. The wheels on 3 of the cars came off while taking the train out of its carton. The wheels are not removable which means the cars were rendered unuseable. This item is poorly made. I find it hard to believe that the manufacturer is unaware of this problem. I suggest avoiding this product like the flu.
1,TRAIN SET -- WORST IN THE WORLD,"SAVE YOUR MONEY... THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WORTH $25.EVERYTHING IS MADE OF PLASTIC, THE WHEELS BREAK-OFF, THE 130 PARTS ARE SO SMALL YOU CAN'T SEE THEM AND THE CONNECTION POINTS DO NOT CONNECT, BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE OF PLASTIC AS WELL.THEY MARKET THIS PRODUCT AS 130 PARTS TO ENTICE YOU IN PURCHASING IT AS IF YOU WERE REALLY RECEIVING SOMETHING BIG, BUT IT'S NOTHING BUT A DISAPPOINTMENT. IT'S LIKE PURCHASING SOMETHING FROM AN ""INFOMERCIAL"", WORTHLESS.SAVE YOUR MONEY. BUY A REAL ""TRAIN SET""... NOT THIS MESS.I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN THE CHILDREN CAME OVER TO PLAY AND IT DIDN'T WORK. I LOVE TRAINS AROUND MY TREE DURING CHRISTMAS AND THIS WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY AND TIME. 6 TO 7 PEOPLE TRIED TO GET IT TO WORK, ONLY ONE TRAIN WORKED AND THEN IT WOULDN'T GO FAST OR AROUND THE TRACK COMPLETELY.AGAIN, SAVE YOUR MONEY... IT'S NOT WORTH A $1.00"
4,KKM Theory and Applications in Nonlinear Analysis,"This is the first comprehensive book on KKM theory and its various applications in nonlinear analysis itself, mathematical economics, game theory and optiomization. The author provides a hudge number of reference resources from the beginning of this subject to the present stage in this new field. It is a best studying and reference book on KKM theory for those people who want to gain knowldege in this exciting subject. It is also a necessary handbook for people working in their Ph.D degree and for research in applied nonlinear analysis and its applications to mathematical economics, game theory and optimization."
5,Chock Full of Delights!,"Texans move to Olympia, Wa and are absorbed by the Olympian borg, and it's a good thing. These guys were Olympians before they moved. ""I dont wanna know 'bout it"", ""why is the world like that,"" and ""liz"" are just a few of many superb pop punk songs on this cd. ""Life is full of parties"" as well as ""Liz"" (and one other) were re-recorded and released as vinyl singles (highly recommended). The singer is also in ""The Prima Donnas"" as a totally different persona, Otto Matik. Otto will deny being Gene Defcon, but he is the same dude. Same goes for Nikki Holiday or Nick Nax, who is in both bands as well and is very very talented. If you like Beat happening and that whole Olympia thang then this is up your alley. I love the colorfulness of the packaging too."
5,Did Someone Say Sexy?,"Although I sometimes think Muddy's vocal stylings edge toward the artificial, what cannot be debated is that this CD contains just about the sexiest set of songs on one CD. It's impossible to pick one favorite. Some personal faves are: ""Long Distance Call"" (delirious), ""Rollin' Stone"" very serious, ""She Moves Me"" which I find funny. While most songs are about the same thing, they are diverse and always interesting musically. There's a swing throughout, and in the latter half with the help of Little Walter's harmonica, a very full sound results.I agree with the reviewer who said ""I'm willing to stick my neck out and assert that Muddy Waters was the greatest blues performer in history."" I feel sorry for rockers who had to follow this man."
5,A must-have,"I'm willing to stick my neck out and assert that Muddy Waters was the greatest blues performer in history. Robert Johnson wrote the world's creepiest blues tunes and his shadow looms large over every blues player who followed him, but Muddy and his band gave birth to rock and roll. They electrified the blues, and not just literally. The band that cut most of these tracks smokes like no other, and the cuts have a sound which, like Sun recordings, just can't be duplicated.It may be the blues, but there is plenty of joy in these recordings, and nobody does bravado like Mr Morganfield ('I'm Ready', 'Mannish Boy' and the sublime 'Hoochie Coochie Man'.)Just look at the track list. The blues does not get any better than this."
2,Not Happy!,Not what I expected. Much smaller than it looks and the colour blue is a little different from what you see in the picture. Inside lining looks very cheap!
5,It works!,"I got sick every time flu season rolled around, and was down at least twice a year. I experimented with this and several other immunity boosters, but the others didn't work as good, and I still got sick every time flu season came.I take three pills of this a day and haven't gotten sick for almost a year now."
5,Fight the flu.,Great product that seems to really work. Has some key herbs to help in fighting off viruses. Haven't been sick since adding them to my diet.
2,"Good product, just not for me...","I was excited to try this product after reading many great reviews about it. I took it for almost 3 months. I became sick shortly after starting to take it, but continued using it thinking it would help my illness. My symptoms were allergy type symptoms that never went away, during the whole 3 months I took this product. I stopped taking it when I ran out of my supply after 3 months and within 2 days my symptoms were gone. My only thought is that I am allergic to one of the ingredients in it (I have horrible allergies to certain plants). Disappointed that this was not a good product for me."
5,exelent book,this is a great book i hav it n i wish to have it in my kindle app . it would be good if kindle put it in it becuz is a good took to carry it in my tabket or phone via kindle.
3,written when TQM was hot,"Somewhat of a faddish book. It came out when TQM was red hot in management circles. Since then, experience with TQM has dampened a lot of that initial ardour.Various chapters of the book are solidly written, though. See the discussion about the different types of contracts - Firm Fixed Price, Cost Plus and others. For a manager, this may be the most crucial portion of the book.Other sections are mundane. Like the different types of charts/graphs with which to visualise data. All the way up to PERT charts."
4,Would be 5 stars if it didn't beep,"This is very easy to use and it's accurate. And it's easier on both you and your pet to not have to take the temperature rectally.It was a little strange to figure out the instructions at first for the covers (which you MUST use), and how to get it positioned correctly in my dog's ear.After one failed try, we got it right and it has been so helpful with my dog whom I've been monitoring post surgery.Please do note that it beeps when the temperature is set (usually a second or two after it's in the dog's ear). My dog isn't thrilled with it beeping right next to her ear, but apart from that, I would recommend this highly."
3,Easy on your Pet............,"I bought this thermometer to use with our dogs and cats. Works great, much safer than a rectal thermometer and very quick. Makes a beep when you activate it and a beep when it is finished but this has not bothered my dogs or cats.It is supposed to be good for 20,000 temperatures or up to 10 years although it only has a 1 year warranty.***The reason for my 3 star review instead of 5 stars is the battery.The internal lithium battery has an estimated built-in life of 5 years. You have to send the thermometer back to the factory at AMC (Advanced Monitors Corp) for service and for a ""nominal fee"" at their discretion they will either replace the battery or the thermometer.Not sure it would be worth the postage fees and ""nominal fee"" which are between $49 and $79 from what I have found in their manual and online.Obviously it would be cheaper to buy a new one but I am hoping that it will last for several years before I have to do that."
4,Little Hard to Figure Out,The Good:------------------Takes temp in secondsEasy to storeComes with lots of tip coversThe Bad:---------------------Somewhat hard to figure outCost more than it is worth (I say $24.99 at the absolute most insane most would be fair)If you run out of tip covers it won't take the temp right
5,well worth the money,I had a sick cat and taking her temp with a digital thermometer rectally was not a fast or plesannt experience.The ear thermometer is accurate and really fast.It works best if you have two people so one can hold the cat and the other can insert the thermometer into the ear but I live alone and have managed to uses it successfully without help.
4,Worked well for what we needed.,The product was as described and it worked very well for what we needed. I would gladly recommend this item.
3,Better than nothing,"Recently purchased this item. Yes, the previous complaints are pretty much founded. Especially trying to see the time at night without pressing a control button. daytime use there is a LCD display of the time which is contrast adjustable. The radio's sound IS tinny and unless you stretch out the power cord (which contains the FM antenna) your reception will be garbled. It has a number of features that you can use and for the money it's worth it. Just don't expect too much."
2,No Speaker Phone,"Cute phone, great concept with the radio and alarms, but this phone has no speaker phone option."
1,Don't buy it!,"I bought this cute little phone because of it's size and features. Well, it's ok for a phone but don't rely on the alarm. It works when it wants to which is not very often! I would suggest spending a few more dollars and getting a ""name"" brand! Looking for a new one myself!"
2,Bellow expectations,"This is like a bedroom phone, with radio, clock and alarm.No problems related to the radio, but the clock does not have the light up during all time.. its difficult to see.. you need to touch any bottom to have lights on.The alarms have options to set 1, 5 or 7 days a week, but they are confuse to set.The CID is very nice, and when you are out the lights flash to let you know whne somebody really called you.If your goal is a CID phone go ahead but if its to have a bedroom phone, I would suggest the GE models."
4,Commets for Cordless Phone with Alamr Clock,"There is a small scratch on the surface, but overall the appearance seems fine. The instruction book was a little confusing, but it is not too difficult to figure out. I am pretty happy with this product."
5,Love this phone,his is exactly what I was looking for to replace my old one that was fried by thTe electrical outage.
2,Fair play? Nope.,"I like mysteries that are a challenge, as long as the author abides by the ""play fair"" rule. Crispin most definitely did not, and the ending made me want to hurl my iPad across the room.SPOILER ALERT*******The murderer was a minor character who appeared once or twice early in the novel and then never was heard from again until his/her confession."
4,gardener's delight,"This is the third season of a delightful horticultural mystery series starring Felicity Kendall and Pam Ferris. The two professional gardeners/amateur sleuths embark on some pretty hair-raising adventures as they travel the globe. Not only do they unearth secrets of the human heart they also solve seemingly impossible gardening puzzles. The series takes you to some really beautiful locations, and it's worth watching just for the scenery. We're treated to such places as Kew Gardens and Regent's Park in London, and Andalusia in southern Spain. Kendall and Ferris really are a great pair of character actors. It's hard to believe that the same Pam Ferris played the abusive, butch Miss Trunchbull in ""Matilda""."
3,Enjoyed season 1 & 2 better ...,"I have the other two series on DVD but this one left me a little lost. I'm not sure why. Over the Summer I'm going to make a concerted effort to re-watch the third season to see if it gels for me as well as S1 and S2.Truth be told, I simply enjoyed the other two seasons much better than this one. I love the two leading ladies and enjoy their characterizations, but the other characters were lacking in a way that didn't draw me in. As a premise, two ladies coming into my life to help me fix my garden(s) -- large or small -- requires me, as a supporting character, to be a strong foil; it's my job as a supporting role to make them look good.Well, in this third series, I don't think the supporting characters make the ladies look good."
5,GIRLS WILL BE GIRLS,"HAVE ALL THE SERIES. SAW THEM FIRST ON PBS. LIGHT DETECTIVE STORIES, BUT WE REALLY LIKE FELICITY KENDAL."
1,cheap plastic,"I bought this because i am a long time megaman fan, however i was disappointed at how flimsy this model was. I am very disappointed."
2,Sorry--bored me to tears,"I have read many Hannah Howell books. Some I have liked very much. BUT not this one. Good it bored me to tears. I may have to add this to my list of ""Books I threw across the room"". The only character I really liked was a minor one--a scott who shows up at the end and plays a part in ""saving the heroine from murder"". Yes that one again. How disappointing...."
3,Lerning robotics,"this book is very good to learn about robotics stuff because it is the most imprecindible book in my library, with this book you gonna learn everything that robotics mean."
4,Finding A Four Leaf Clover,"After seeing and hearing Leslie Mallery perform locally in the Twin Cities area the past few years, it was a stroke of luck discovering that she has finally released a CD. With a voice that reminds one of Joan Baez, the songs on this release range from traditional Irish and Scottish folk music to contemporary self-penned tales. The tune stack flows easily from one to the other, and along the way the listener is treated to jigs and slides that are sure to get you out of your chair and dancing. In addition to the title track, the song ""Sean"" is a favorite that packs an emotional punch even after repeated listenings. (One can imagine this one sung on the stage of the Grand Old Opry by Patsy, Kitty or Tammy.)Probably the best thing about this CD is that you know there will be more to follow. Hopefully we won't have to wait too long. Ms. Mallery is an artist of great depth and bright promise."
4,This is great dance music with a swing.,There is nothing like listening to great latin music with your grandchildren who seem puzzled that there is more to music than hard rock and rap...then watch their interest level raise. Thank you Mom for the well rounded approach to the world of music.
4,Good for it's genre,"This is a pretty good basic business sim,acquainting you with the basics of the supply chain and how business works. It can be a time eater!"
2,Not what I had hoped for,"I was looking for something on par with warcraft and starcraft by blizzard, but what I got was ""convenience store tycoon"", not as playable as Hasbro's Rollercoaster tycoon. but definitly the red tape paperwork frustration of business, caveat empor"
3,"Nice educational software, but it gets boring after a while.","I was very excited when I got this game, and enjoyed, learn something when played. But after a while, it got little boring. Should put some spice onto the software little more. user interface is little confusing, so you have to play ""learning"" scenario to learn all the interface. And I hope they put more educational facts, such as business term definitions, more accounting formulas, maybe some business case-studies; make it even more educational and fun to play..."
5,Best Sim Game Ever!!!,"Capatilism 2 allows you do do a lot of the stuff. It's competion can be extreamly high. Unlike most sim games, you get to do research and it acsually makes you fell as if it were real. I'd buy this game even if it were $100!"
4,A Classic,"Build a mega-corporation by vertically integrating all the industries in the supply chain. You build the stores, the farms, the mines, and the factories. You select the products, and set the pricing and marketing policies. You can even setup the functional layout and input/output of your factories. With a graphics and interface overhaul, this one could be a strong seller again. But even with it's dated graphics, it's head and shoulders above most of the ""Tycoon"" dreck that's being churned out these days."
4,"very good, but not perfect","This is a very strong game, but the only problem is that it is only for certain people. This game is for people who like business games or money games. Also many empire building people would like this game. The game has strong graphics and easy to understand menus.The only problem with the game is that many of the cities look the same and there is really no difference between the products you sale and make or the products the other people make.Really this is a very good game and an over looked game by many. The main problem that seemed to happen to me is that if you set the game to easy or if you don't venture out into new fields the game gets old. Beside that though a great game for people who love business games."
5,Highly Recommended!,"Jeffrey J. Fox has a talent for pointing out the obvious, but often forgotten, basics of business and management. Like Fox's previous books, How to Become a Great Boss contains almost nothing that is entirely original. Instead, it compiles what should be common-sense guidelines for effective leadership and presents them in a manner that is both educational and inspirational. Fox has the ability to get you thinking about what you are doing as a manager and about the things that you have allowed to fall by the wayside. For that simple but valuable lesson, we from getAbstract strongly recommend this book to all bosses, managers and leaders."
1,"Did not do it for me, but it may for you!","Did not screen this book much and well, I did not enjoy it or get much out of it. It may be appropriate for for beginner employee, but not good enough for the beginner boss. The dogmatic tone will probably grate just about anyone. Either way I would buy used. I would not pay more than 20 cents plus shipping for this book which thanks to the internet is a price easily obtained!"
2,Very General,"These are the basics... Some mangers probably need this but I would like to think that most are beyond this kind of general and obvious information. I got this book on CD and it was boring, I hate to imagine what it would be like to have read it. I recomend Primal Leadership."
1,Not the least bit helpful,I normally don't write reviews but I just read this book and I couldn't believe how much of a waste of money it was. Here's the book in a nutshell- Hire good employees and fire bad ones.
5,Readable Gem,"This book is different from most business books in two ways:One, it is readable, two, it is a gem. The first chapter alone is worth the price. I am prompted to write this reviewto correct an earlier review which claims Mr. Fox has a big ego because the word ""I"" is used so often. The word ""I"" is not used even once by Mr. Fox. It does appear in the epilogue which is a collection of terrific quotes from great bosses. Take one hour and read this superb and important little book."
1,Stale and Old,"I just don't get it. As a manager for many years, I came away from this book with a sense that I was being lead astray. The author is hardpressed to come to any sort of conclusions that are meaningful and he seems to just fill the pages with words. He might be a good typist, but as a writer he has much to be desired. There is also an ego problem here too. The word I is used so many times that I felt like the author was advertising himself, instead of trying to help managers like myself. This is not a good book!"
2,Not worth the effort,"Lost my interest very quickly. Not worth buying. Get ""The Help"" if you are looking for something more interesting. This got very repetitive and lost my interest very quickly."
2,no lasting or deep insight is offered,"Yes there are a few interesting experiences related, but they are expressed in such a manner that they make no real or lasting impression. This is a very short book and as of now it is free; so if you are interested in first person history and have a couple of spare hours, i see no reason not to give it a read. Included in the text is the essay ""The Race Question in America"" by Dr. P. Thomas Stanford; the essay is a good recounting of the successes and progress of Black America at the turn of the centuries (1800 into 1900)."
3,disapointed,The drawer is not working rite so sometimes takes a while to get it to work Ups was boxed up wrong and was covered with ink
1,WORST PRINTER EVER!,"This is the worst printer I have ever had, the print quality is ok, if you can EVER get it to print. Constant paper jams, it can't go through more than a couple prints without getting jammed. Then when you clear the jam it gets jammed again. Prepare to spend at least an hour if you want to print more than 10 pages at once, you will need it to clear all the paper jams. This thing is useless and a piece of junk."
4,Great for the price,There are better ear protections out there but not for this price. I use them for shooting and they work great. I have not yet tried prolonged use. (over 20 min)
3,Hearing Protectors,"learning how to use a gun for self defense. Realtors are somewhat vulnerable with solo showings of houses, never know whoone will run into."
4,Very snug,"I have a very small head and found these very snug. If you have a large head, you might find these too tight. This is probably good for serious hearing protection but such snugness is probably overkill for my purpose, which is mowing the lawn."
5,Excellent ear covers!,My husband & I both like to shoot at our local gun club and he was using ear covers that were so stiff and tight that headaches were a given. BUT then he tried my ear covers like these and loved them! So got him his own pair for his birthday :) They provide excellent ear protection on the firing range and are extremely comfortable and lightweight to wear!!! Great product!
3,good sound reduction,"They do what they are designed to do. However, they would be much improved if they could be adjusted for size. One size does not fit all. Luckily, my hat size is 6 7/8, so they just barely fit. Even so I would like to be able to extend them just a bit."
3,Another Death Merchant bloodbath.,"The Death merchant is probably my favorite of the Men's Action series from the 70's.Nightmare in Algeria doesn't have the extensive footnotes or science fictional aspects of many of the DM books, but it does have the requisite carnage, action, and subterfuge of a solid tetosterone filled bloodthirsty adventure.Richard Camelion is sarcastic and brutal as always as he slays Middle-Eastern terrorists and their Black radical allies while ridiculing the religious beliefs of his Israeli partner.If you're a left-winger or pious, you might as well skip the DM series; However, if you like a ton of bloody brutal action with some wild plots, extensive information about violent organizations and technology, and a lead character who is philosophical and well educated, then you'll probably like this series."
4,Etta at Her Best; Disappointing Fade-Out Cuts.,"This re-master of some of Ms. James' best works is a memorable, must-have for any fan. Her soaring vocals and intricate, symphonic arrangements produce an angelic combination. WARNING: The decision to shorten many cuts on this CD by prematurely fading out of song selections, however, is a travesty akin to ""editing"" a great work of fiction -- and greatly diminishes the listener's enjoyment. For shame!"
5,Etta's Best,"This collection embraces all of Etta's wonderful range. All of my favorites are on this CD including my all time favorite song, ""At Last"" I'm a fairly young fan, she was singing decades before I was born, but her influence on modern R&B is obvious. I would recommend this collection to any R & B lover, no matter what their age."
3,Etta James-50th Anniversary Colcection,"I preferred her earlier works and CD's. While she will always be great, the quality just isn't the same. Louise London, UK"
3,Ok,Of course we love Etta James but this cd sounded very grainy. When they redid it apparently they did not clean it up like many old time records are done. Still love the music. It was here on time and packed well.
5,A soulful strut through American music history,Etta James has so much soul that she makes Aretha Franklin sound like Karen Carpenter!! This is a great album from a remarkable singer. Needs to be in your R & B collection....
1,Etta,This product never downloaded to my computer. This happens frequently. so i can not review this cd at this time
3,Loved some of it,Loved some of the songs. Others were interesting to listen to. I consider some of it rather classic easy listening
5,Too little Etta,"The selection of songs on this CD is terrific. Etta James can sing anything from ballads to rock better than anyone alive, and these songs show off her range (besides being some of her best stuff). But I'd suggest going straight for The Essential Etta James. It costs more, but it's got twice as many songs, and every one is a gem. (Besides, you just can't call it Etta's ""best"" without including her brilliant, gospel-tinged ""God's Song."") Once you hear Etta James sing, you'll wish you had the larger collection."
4,She's not a drag queen!,"Another great compilation by Etta James. Doesn't meet the excellence of ESSENTIAL 2-CD, but is still a comprehensive career-spanning musical adventure! By the way, to the reviewer, Etta James is a not a drag queen, she was born under the name Jamesetta Hawkins."
5,Great Stories for Halloween,"This book makes for quite an interesting read, even if you're not a huge ghost story fan. If you are, well then it's even better.The author is a highly effective and efficient writer; the stories flow so well that you tend to forget you're reading. It's actually more like you're listening to a great storyteller.Lots of variety in the stories make this book a real page-turner. I read the whole thing in one afternoon/evening. It was almost midnight by the time I finished, which took me quite by surprise, and serves as an example of how engrossing the stories are. The introduction is perfectly suited for the stories that follow, and leads you right into the 'meat' of the book with a clever transition.My favorite chapters include ""The Haunted Hotel"", ""The Thing in the Cabin"" and ""The Phantom of Breazeale House"".If you are even remotely interested in ghosts/paranormal phenomena, it would be a mistake to pass this one up."
2,The Chef's night off.,"I'm beginning to feel that I have just had a terrible meal at a restaurant that everyone else has raved about! Try as I may, I could not get through Jane Hamilton's recent book without struggling through every chapter. I found the plot rather thin and for the most part, boring. There were countless times when I put the book down for the final time. A few memorable sentences held my attention, but for the most part I did not find the writing to be of the standard I expect from this author. I have finished- and just as I thought, the dessert did not meet my expectations."
3,"Entertaining author, mediocre book","Many authors have tried to write in a gender other than their own and have been successful to varying degrees...Jane Hamilton just doesn't seem to make it in her first person rendition of a 17 year old male's angst and disbelief at the discovery of his mother's cyberaffair...the characters here are unbelieveable and unengaging...Elvira's obsession with Civil War anachronism is cute, but seems to be very peripheral to the central theme of the book (Henry's introduction to the world of parental dalliance). Hamilton has a knack with words, and her writing is entertaining and at times thought provoking, but this novel seems to have been created on a thread of an idea that never seemed to become woven into a fabric."
3,probably 3 1/2 stars...,"While I think that Jane Hamilton is one of the finest contemporary authors, I don't think that this book is up to her usual standards. Perhaps the main focus of the novel should have been on Elvira - easily the most complex and interesting character in the book. Henry comes alive only when interacting with his female high school friend; the rest of the time he is too detached to elicit empathy. Beyond telling Elvira's story, I didn't see a point to the book. Henry and his parents disappointed me, Elvira delighted me."
2,Disobedience Disappoints,"I have read other novels by Jane Hamilton which I liked; so I was excited to see this one. But I was very disappointed. Actually, I didn't finish the novel. It started to bog down about half way through and I didn't really care enough about the characters to finish. I just could not relate to the main character and the others did not seem real."
5,Not Like Anything You've Read Before,"Jane Hamilton's latest novel, ""Disobedience"", isn't like anything I've ever read before. Her characters are NOT main-stream Americans; there are musicians and a couple of Civil War fanatics for example, and while tales of female infidelity have been done to death (usually literally, see ""Anna Karenina"") I don't think it has ever been told through the eyes of the woman's son who discovered her perfidy through e-mail spying.I was especially intrigued by the juxtaposition of sister Elvira being able to eavesdrop (camouflaged as a boy) on the men of her Civil War reenactment regiment, and that of the protagonist, Henry spying from the kitchen on his mother's female reading circle. Both are privy to the unfettered ruminations of the opposite sex, but when discovered, the reactions of the two groups couldn't be more different.""Disobedience"" is a fully satisfying read."
3,a mixed bag,"This is my first Hamilton book and I found it absorbing enough to want to reach the end. The writing is very good in places, but I have to admit that the reviewer below hit the nail on the head regarding the book's fatal flaw -- Henry never sounds like the ""real"" narrator -- I kept feeling that I was reading Hamilton's voice channeled through a 20 something male. I found Kevin, the father, to be the most interesting character of the novel. In his own quiet way (nothing like the flamboyant Elvira or the restless mother), he keeps the family together and waits for his wife to return to him. He was the only character I felt for -- the others are a remarkably unsympathetic lot. I think if Hamilton hadn't been famous before this novel, no one would have been very interested in it. I was impressed in parts, but overall it's pretty mediocre."
4,Family life,"Jane Hamilton takes us within another Midwestern family through the eyes of Henry, the older son. It is written as a memory of his senior year in high school from the perspective of an adult. We see his pain, anger and confusion over his mother's affair. She is commuting from Chicago to Wisconsin to be with her violinist lover.Henry is navigating through his senior year in high school in urban Chicago after the family has spent his earlier years in rural Vermont. His younger sister, Elvira, is a hard core Civil War re-en actor who is passing as a boy with her fellow soldiers. His father is a history teacher, whose unflagging optimism, Henry finds galling. His mother is a talented pianist who is making beautiful music with N Ukrainian violinist in Wisconsin.Henry observes his mother's affair through reading her e-mails which he prints and keeps for posterity.Ultimately it's the dynamics of relationships and what holds a family together that makes this an interesting and satisfying novel."
4,This Mother is High.......,"This book is written about a 17-year old boy and how he deals with the knowledge that his 38-year old mother is having an affair. When I read this, I almost felt like I could be the mother if certain factors fell into place. When I told someone about the book, he asked me if I was contemplating an affair! The young man seems very emotionally healthy despite the chaos in his house. I have a 17 year old and he is a very good son. The author is clever with her descriptions and writes about some very funny situations. The ending seems reasonable, but I decided I couldn't leave the book around the house for my teenagers to read. I left it on a Delta airplane seat pocket if anyone wants it. ps/ The ""adult"" in the story is the son!"
4,"E-mail, Oedipus and the Civil War (re-enacted)",This was a fun story - we learn from the narrator son Henry about his quirky but loveable family. The basis for the story is Henry's obsession with his oedipal relationship with his mother when he discovers from her e-mail that she is having an affair. This story would wear thin under the pen of any less a writer than Jane Hamilton. But the other members of the Shaw family are so entertaining that I didn't mind Henry's inability to get a life. I read this one straight through.
4,Only the disobedient had fun!,"Those who obeyed were dull, like the father in this story. The son was disobedient, he read the mother's email. The sister refused to be feminine, and the mother, well, she cheated on her husband. Nuff said. It took awhile to start to like this book, but once I did, it was great. At first I was put off by the son, whining about what he thought his mother was doing while he lived to invade her privacy. But the ending was great. Sometimes things are the way they are, and perfect isn't always that."
1,Disobey the critics-don't read this one!,"Disobedience is poorly written and not worth endless, boring hours attempting to find a plot. Granted, the premise was interesting--a 17 yr old boy discovers his mother's affair by snooping in her email. However, that is where interest ends and confusion begins. The author has countless point-of-view problems; the voice of Henry is of undeterminate age and 17 and speaks at the same time (sometimes in the same paragraph). The plot is slow moving to the point of tedium. By page 100 I was wondering who cares!"
2,Disappointingly detached,"Being a huge Jane Hamilton fan, I have to admit I was disappointed with Disobedience, in no small part to the detached, third-party view of the characters through the eyes of Henry, a world-weary and not terribly insightful teenager (which in my opinion, he should be, if he is going to be telling the story). I also found quite tedious the numerous ways Henry refers to his mother, ranging from ""mom"" to ""Mrs. Shaw"" to ""Beth"" to her ""Liza38"", her e-mail screen name. These references are used interchangeably and frequently, using up to three of these monikers in a single paragraph! Not sure what the point is of this particular literary device. I never really understood the motivations of any of the characters, thus could not sympathize with them. Also, events in the book evolve without a sense of how much time has elapsed between them, so context is lost. Would have appreciated at least alternating chapters in different characters voices to get their perspective on events."
1,Disliked most of the characters,"I've always enjoyed Jane Hamilton's books and still think she's a gifted writer, but had to force myself to finish this book. The main character's voice isn't remotely believable for a 17-year-old, then 20-something-year-old young man. His use of ""Mrs. Shaw,"" ""my mother,"" ""Liza,"" ""Beth,"" etc. etc. etc. for his mother is likely a metaphor for a life lesson, but I found it extremely mannered and annoying. Why change her name 8 times in one paragraph?Absolutely detested the Elvira character--also totally unbelievable for a 13-year-old. I never found myself warming to her and was quite unmoved by her ""ordeal."" His father was never anything more than a vague presence, which is possibly the point.The basic premise is a great one and could've been a thought-provoking, insightful, more enjoyable read without the self-conscience intellectualizing and the Civil War obsession."
3,Obsessive son's account of his home life....,"Although this novel was brilliantly written, I found the subject matter to be boring and slightly unsettling. There are many incidents in the novel which lead me to ask the question, how much does the author, Ms. Hamilton, or any woman really, know about how a teenage male thinks & acts? How he deals with relationships with family, friends, and love interests. It seems far fetched througout the book. Also, the story that unfolds (from the main character, Henry's, viewpoint) is disturbing. His obsessive interest in his mother's love affair & the belief that he was his mother's husband in a former life left a bad taste in my mouth. This isn't the type of book I normally read & the only reason I finished it was due to the fact that I was interested in what would happen to Henry's sister Elvira. I wouldn't recommend this novel to my family or friends or anyone else."
2,By no means this author's best work,"Having considered Map of the World one of the best books I have ever read, and having considered Book of Ruth a very unique and special book, I could not believe this book was even written by Jane Hamilton. The narrator seemed to accurately describe the other family members without really caring about them. (Is his detatchment supposed to be proof that he is adolescent?). After observing his mother's affair electronically, he seemed to have learned nothing from the experience, and come to no realizations afterwards. Most of the events in this character's life were isolated and without any theme or connection to a ""point"". A brief conversation with his mother at the book's end was supposed to suffice as a conclusion. I finished this book feeling totally disappointed and dissatisfied."
5,Looking back without anger,"""Disobedience"" is written as a first-person narrative ten years after the events of the story take place. A 17 year old ""boy"" (hmmm - there's that fine line between boy and man. . evident in the story itself) finds himself the unintended eavesdropper on his mother's affair through her e-mails. His own relationship with each of his parents, and theirs with his 13 year-old sister, a fanatic Civil War re-enactor who dresses and plays the role of a male, is colored by his secret knowledge of his mother's liaisons. The family is quirky enough, and the boy's insights into the absurdity of the male/female psyche keep the book moving, and filled with wry humor.The abridged audio version is only 4 cassettes - a ""quick read."" I highly recommend this work by an author whose work I have not read before. In fact, I have avoided opening any of her books because she was an Oprah Book Club pick!"
3,Disappointing Discourse,"I've enjoyed Jane Hamilton's previous books 'The Book of Ruth' and 'A Map of the World' for their strong, believable characters and descriptive narration. She is an excellent writer, and one of my favorite contemporary authors. However...'Disobedience' was more of a Disappointment for me. The story begins when 17-year old Henry, the family computer expert, logs onto his mother's e-mail account and discovers that she's having an affair. An adult Henry narrates several years later, recounting family life during the year of the affair. This narrative just didn't ring true for me. It read more like a 40 year old woman's version of a 17-year old boy. What male, 17 or otherwise, uses terms like 'feminine rage'? The characters were one-dimensional, the story rambled, and the 'climactic ending' was flat."
1,Endless teen angst bores me,"A story of teen angst and adultery. I couldn't identify with the characters, I found the writing excessively self-indulgent, and I didn't enjoy the story. I wish I had the hours back."
1,boring boring boring,"less than one star, actually. Could not even manage to get to page 100 - which is my minimum. I refuse to waste time reading boring drivel when there are so many good books to be discovered and so little time to read them. I bought this hoping for another 'map of the world.' i probably should have known better since i didn't finish her last book either. i agree with a previous reviewer about the narrator's voice sounding inauthenthic. the civil war daughter was a silly and boring distraction. the father - less than one dimensional. nothing ever happened. there was no there, there! Though I LOVED a map of the world, it was clearly an anomoly in hamilton's body of work. will not bother with her again."
3,OK,"This is the first book by Jane Hamilton I have read. It was pretty good, and I want to read more of her writing.It's a great idea for a story. My main criticisms are 1...the narrative will just get going, and the author will go off on some tangent about feelings for far too long (we're smart enough to figure it out, we don't need everything spoon fed to us), and 2...the 17 year old male narrator is sometimes witty and cannily observant, but often smug and annoying. I wouldn't want him for a friend."
1,disappointment,"Why all the stars for Disobedience? I was excited to begin Hamilton's new book since I have loved all her previous novels. But this one is flat, flat, flat. Dumb plot, unbelievable characters except for Elvira who is more quirky than real. Somehow I canot believe in Henry even though he is writing about all this 10 years after. Miss Hamilton's writing can be arresting and it is for fear that I will miss a beautiful string of words that I am plodding slowly and painfully to the last page."
5,Great book!,"This was an absolutely terrific book. I just loved it. There were multiple themes played out by a host of great characters, every one of them interesting and likable. The overriding theme was about sons and mothers, but there surely were things going on that were about brother and sister, husband and wife, among others. The writing, too, was spectacular. The main character was a young man, perhaps 30, who was looking back on his family's life the year he was 17. The voice of the 17-year-old was dead-on, and he spoke with teenage humor and irony in appropriate doses. There were also some gems that were not part of the dialogue, but the observations of situations and characters that expressed the complexity of relationships with poetic language. I suspect that this book will remain with me for a long time to come and that I will recommend it regularly."
3,My First Jane Hamilton Experience,"I read the summary of this book and it sounded good. Then I started it and, I don't know if this applies to all of Jane Hamilton's books, discovered that she goes on page after page of rambling. This would have been a better book if she wouldn't spend pages rambling about things that usually have nothing to do with the progressment of the plot. The only character I found interesting was Elvira. This book would have had a higher rating if the author just stuck to the story and left the randomless thought behind, but by then it would have ended up a short story."
2,Boring,"This is the first Jane Hamilton book I have ever read. I received Disobedience as a Christmas gift this year. Since I see the person who gave it to me (who wanted to read it herself)everyday, I knew that she would be watching me to see if I read it. I really tried to like it. Hamilton is undoubtly a talented writer, now if she only had something to write about. There are few books that I can't finish, unfortunately this is one of them. If I had to sum up my feelings for this book in one word it would be: BORING."
2,disfuntional family,"This book was boring, I couldn't become interested in it, the characters, the story and everything else about it. I liked the 'Book of Ruth' and 'Map of the World', but this was just uninteresting. The characters were unlikable, the bossy mother-in-law who held her money over the family, the incompetent father who was ineffective with his family, his high school students and with life in general.Then there was the wife and mother who had an affair and her nosy son who found about it when working on her computer. There was Elvira who hated being a girl and bonded with her father as both liked Civil War Enactments. I struggled through the book and finished it though it was difficult."
3,"love Jane Hamilton, didn't love this book",I have read Book of Ruth twice and Map of the World. I loved them both but had difficulty getting through this story. I found the affair boring and would have liked to known less about the e-mails and more about the family relationships. What would have happened if they had found out early in the book? How would they have coped?
2,Not really that useful,"I had high expectations when I purchased this CD. It was o.k. and had some good information, but it really wasn't as impressive as I was hoping it would be."
3,Vitamins arn't created equal,Ultra man Vitmans are Ok. Most vitamins are all the same though. It doesnt do any better than some cheaper one's. But It does have alot of what a man needs in his system.
3,The Father Of Rock N Roll,"ALL song tracks on this CD should have been presented in STEREO. I rated this as *** because the the program presentation. Had it been in STEREO, I would have rated it as *****. I don't know why CLASSIC songs like these are not digitaly remastered VIA COMPUTER to play in STEREO!"
5,Got it for my girlfriend..,Very Funny. we both got a good laugh out of it. I recommend for this book for fans of the series
4,Terrific Symphonies,"This is a great coupling from DG originals. The Berlin Philharmonic, under the direction of Igor Markevitch, is in top form on the 3rd and 4th Symphonies by lesser known composer Franz Berwald. These are very unconventional, yet fully satisfying romantic works. Schubert's Symphony No. 4 is altogether more recognizable piece, and it is the perfect fit after the Berwald symphonies. The recordings are in mono (from 1955) but they are first rate. Finally, the CD logs in at almost 80 minutes, so you get a lot of value for your money."
4,"Cute - For Witches, not Wiccans","I saw this book at Barnes & Nobles and thought it was funny. I like little books even if they aren't very practical. I am amused by the ""don't buy this"" comments from some reviewers. First of and foremost - all Witches are NOT wiccan. Witchcraft and wicca are NOT the same thing. Life is not all love and light and positive. Sometimes it's painful, seething anger, and darkness. When you are reeling from a recent breakup or other emotional trauma, the IDEA of turning the ex into a toad is enough to put a smile on your face and put you back in the light. This is humor people - try some!"
4,"Nice Book,Nice Spells but Lack of Information..............","-I cant say this book is for beginners.This book is size of my palm & I must say this is a Nice book.Only caution is dont take it tooooooooooo seriously.Before trying these spells Please take some knowledge about how to cast spells (basic information).I loved the way Deborah is written this book.Spells are simple & fun.One great thing about this book is,It will make you feel better.You will feel Kind of shift inside you.That is where Magic begins.Buy It,Read It & See Magic Everywhere because it is Inside you."
1,Enough Already!,"Hasn't the trend of cutesy little spellbooks gone on long enough? The public at large already thinks Witches are flaky (those who don't think we're evil); do we really need books like this to perpetuate the myth? The title itself is a violation of most Pagan ethics; how many young people will read this and think it's ""cool"" to get revenge or manipulate others? There are so many good books out there on magic...please don't start with this one!"
4,good GRAVY... just let people have FUN!,"OK! i too am a teenager and a practitioner of Wicca, but everyone needs to calm down and realize that if YOU are secure enough with YOUR belief, then just let people who want to read this book WHICH is CLEARLY listed under HUMOUR if you would stop to take a moment to READ the inside of the book instead of just looking at it and being DISGUSTED! GEESH! PLEASE remember that as a wiccan, which so many of you have stated that you are, that you must RESPECT other's faiths and beliefs, as different or foreign as they are! this is a CUTE book for reading, but personally i would not practice these suggested spells of vanity, but it, as well as the other book by the authors is a very fun read... so just CHILL out! ~Meg"
5,VERY INTERESTING,I recomend this for the beginning witch practioner.. It will help to figure out if this is what you want to do in life..
2,its a really small book,this book is pretty small and contains very few practical spells. Not worth my time.
4,ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!,It puzzles me why all wiccans have to link witch craft with the Wicca religion; though every Wicca is a witch; not every witch is a Wicca; and if someone decides to write a book about black magic or witch craft it doesn't have to be related to Wicca! So BACK OFF AND SHUT UP; we all heard enough about your beliefs and what you stand for; and witchcraft is not restricted to and only to wiccans! Wiccans can do it there way; and leave the rest of us to follow our own path.
4,"nice, but a little bit faded","My boys like these, although the colors are a little bit more muted than I was expecting them to be. Also, I think they run a litle bit small, so if you are on the border between sizes, definitely go up."
3,"EXCELLENT BIBLE STUDY, BUT USES DIFFICULT BIBLE TRANSLATION","Nelson has really done their homework with this bible study resource. It is excellent! The highlighted areas for each chapter really add understanding and their plain language summary at the end of each chapter brings clarity. Our biggest problem with this resource is that it relys on the New King James version of the bible for its study text. Our bible study group has two couples who are completely new to the bible and this has been very difficult for them. Translations such as the NIV or NLT have helped a lot, but do not sync with some of the questions and all of the ""fill in the blanks"" sections of the book. If you like using the NKJV, though, this bible study will bring clarity to a very complicated book of the bible."
5,well worth the money,I have had the battery tender for about a month now works great very convient your are able to have 4 batteries at the same time hooked to this. For people that have multiple things that need to be charged at the same time you cant go wrong with this. Is the cheapest in price that i found just for the unit itself but i needed the 25 foot extensions for it and ebay had the same charger and the extensions for about a dollar cheaper but for the unit itself couldnt find it cheaper nowhere.
1,Disavowed Knowledge,"Amazon lists this as ""my recommendation."" I however neither endorse nor recommend this or any book from Amazon."
2,not a great hose,"I hooked this hose to plastic threads on a hose reel. No leaks. However, the hose kinked worse than any hose I've ever used while I was putting it on the hose reel."
5,A Well Worthwhile Read for Spriritual Path Seekers,"Joel S. Goldsmith wrote ""The Contemplative Life"" back in the early nineteen-sixties but it is as timely if not more timely for readers today.A sensible well thought out approach which address problems experienced by many who are disallusioned or confused from their experiences with organized religions and even ""cult cures"", ""The Contmplative Life"" provides balm for what spiritually ails at least some part of humanity.This book rings to us like the real thing, demands nothing of the reader except willingness to seek and find a personal spiritual solution. A well worthwhile read and very accessible thanks to the efficiency of the folks at Amazon.comThe Contemplative LifeWe found a great read to follow this up with to be:The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenmentby Eckhart Tolle. Both books were suggested to us by dear friends who have traveled their own respective spiritual journeys. Peace, Love and Serenity."
5,Thanks for Joel Goldsmith,"I am extremely thankful that this book was available on Kindle. I wish all of Joel's books were available. This book inspires me, as do all of his works. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to realize their closeness with God in their life."
5,Wonderful Music,"I recently bought Tim Janis's latest cd, A Thousand Summers,and was so affected by the music that I had to buy this one. He is an extraordinary musician with an unbounded talent. His compositions and arrangements are beyond beautiful. I will put this cd on and play it,then play it again:over and over,never tiring of it. This album is both relaxing and inspirational. I feel so moved as I listen and marvel that one can compose such music that never becomes tiring,but can inspire you to keep listening. I would recommend this to anyone;it is so wonderful."
1,Mall Goof,"I first had the displeasure of hearing the Tim Janis ensemble at a mall. I am not sure why it is called an ensemle as there was only a fiddle and piccolo player. They weren't even really playing anything, just mime-ing to an audio recording of the Titanic theme, over and over again. This music made me want to vomit. If anyone were ever to buy any of this material, I feel it would be a huge mistake. I am pretty sure that this Tim Janis guy does not even exist as the only people at the mall were three women. I am sure that the medical facilities that play this music are catering to coma patients only, otherwise I am sure there would be a revolt."
5,Heart filling joy,"I first heard Tim's music at a mall while shopping with my seven year old granddaughters. His music was so breathtaking that we had to sit and listen. I purchased my first CD ""Flowers in October"", followed by two others. This music is so beautiful it lifts my spirits! I sent my nieces husband a copy of ""December Morning"" - Both love it so much they are fighting over who gets to take it with them. I'm going to purchase more to send to them ---It's just difficult to decide which cd 's to select -"
5,"Hilarious, heart warming, and breathtaking!","This is so much better then the first Ranma theatrical release - this one is actually entertaining! It has everything - from Happousai swiping Ranma-chan's shirt and even further destroying Kuno's shipwrecked yaucht, to the kidnapping of the girls one by one (love the save by Ryouga with Akane!). Then the martial arts bridal contest as the girls are forced to compete for the title of bride to prince Toma. Who wins? Who else? Anyway, Ranma comes to the rescue once again! This tape had some excellent moments - the battle scene with Shampoo and Mousse vs the birdman was beautiful and touching. Ryouga's reluctant rescue of Ukyo? >snicker< Classic Nabiki and her commanding presence (heehee).And of course, Ranma and Akane - more heartwarming scenes in this one tape then I've seen so far in the series I've seen! If you only get one Ranma tape, get this one!"
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!,Ok this movie is just great. It is not as serious as the first film and shows more of what the TV show is like. Also I liked it because girl type is in it more and she is like my third favorite character (the first being Shampoo and the second being Nabiki.) This movie is great with some wonderful battles like when Mousse battles for Shampoo.
4,"Good, if you have seen the series.","This is not a starter anime. It was intended as an additional movie to the 100+ episode Ranma 1/2 series. Ranma 1/2 fans will find it quite intertaining; and the added animation quality that it exhibits is wonderful.If you are new to anime, then I would actually recommend that you check out the Ranma 1/2 tape #1 first. It is *very* funny and available dubbed in English or subtitled in Japanese. If you do decide to watch the movie first, keep in mind that there will be a lot of things going on in the background that you might not get at first glance. Even so, this movie should still be entertaining."
4,Sexy but not practical,"The shoes are very sexy but not practical. I bought these as a gift for my wife, and she had trouble walking in them. When buying this type of shoe, consider a whole size larger than what you would normally wear."
2,no good,These shoes are not described as being a wide fit yet are extremely wide where the toe covering is making them dangerous as you slop and slide around in the toe portion of the shoe. If they were too small they could be stretched but being too big is a problem that will cost as much as the shoe to fix - unless of course you actually need a wide fit shoe then this will be ok for you....
1,Terrible Fit,"These shoes don't come in half sizes. Size 8 usually fits me perfectly in every shoe so I got these in size 8. The front toe area of the shoe is so wide that my toes hang off the edge of the front of the shoes. Maybe if the toe opening had been a bit more narrow, it might have improved the way they feel on my feet. Size 8 is not exactly big enough and a size 9 would've been way too huge. A half size probably would've been perfect in these. The fit is just really awkward. I was looking forward to wearing them out sometime but now I only wear them around the house to amuse my husand because he loves the shoes a lot more than I do Lol."
1,Disappointed!,"I am very disappointed in the shoe itself, and also the seller's policy. One of the shoes (right) fits great and has no issues, but the other (left) is totally messed up! The toe strap is so tight my foot barely makes it in, and there is no way in hell I could use these!!! I wanted to exchange them but the return policy is 30 days, and with my busy lifestyle I wasn't able to get them back in time, and now I am stuck with shoes I can do nothing with! =( Not happy."
4,Looks Sexy,It looks very comfortable but I ending up not liking it. The front strap was too wide for my foot.
4,Interesting script!,"This script has several points which eventually will engage you. A young couple fascinated by the idea of making easy money; a female cold blood assassin with serious emotional conflicts never resolved from her childhood , supported by dreamingly fly backs ad finally a man who will fall in love with...The mother instinct will work out as a fundamental device and dramatic spring ; both women practically will turn the orders and the male plains.The greed, the violence and the redemption will blend in this dark picture with Hannah as the merciless murderer without any scruple. Twenty grand is the cipher.Good camera work and an intriguing thriller that gets its aim."
2,Give me a break,"I have to say this was not a very good movie. Daryl Hannah is a hit woman gone soft. She can't do her job anymore because she's pregnant. It's not believable in the slightest. She has her target two feet in front of her in several scenes and she turns away because the target is also pregnant. There are some flashback scenes that delve into the Daryl character's past...abuse and such leading to her being a hit woman, I guess. Save your time and money. Daryl Hannah was marginal in terms of her acting, but the real annoyance in this movie was Dominique Swain. Her acting was horrible beyond description. Save your money and see or buy something else."
1,Not worth the price of the rental.,"Like Daryl Hannah but this movie was bad. Sub-rate acting from all the actors and a predictable plot. If you are looking for an action movie with a female assassin, keep looking."
5,The REAL roots of rock'n'roll 101,"If you've heard ""His Best 1947-1956"" but thought it lacked a rythm section, well then, you've come to the right place. Starting with ""All Aboard"" McKinley Morganfield & Co. take you on a wild, wailing train ride through the South Side of Chicago. The original ""Got My Mojo Working"" will kick your teeth in upon first listen. This disk is a mainstay in my CD player and is an absolute must-have for anyone who likes rock or blues."
4,Prefer the Earlier Years,"While Muddy Waters is always a quantum leap above most other blues men, I prefer the earlier compilation: ""His Best 1947-1956"". The song content is sometimes gimmicky here; I suspect he was thinking about his audience too much. There are even some songs I have to skip entirely.Still a great CD to own for these songs: A fantastically swinging ""All Aborad"" with great harmonica playing again by Little Walter, ""Forty Days & Forty Nights"", a very serious ""Rock Me"" and my favorite - ""You Shook Me"".Perhaps more than the earlier compilation, these songs show a range of structure that's wide and high."
5,an essential recording,An essential recording for any blues fan. The original Chicago blues master backed by the Chess musicians who originated the Chicago sound with him.
3,Oops,I should have read more reviews. This kitty condo is too lightweight for bigger cats. It is better suited for kittens. Too costly to refund and ship back. I will garage sale. :o(
3,its just ok,the upper interior shelf only covers half the area. I would not have purchased the condo had I been informed of this.
2,Cat Condo,Diappointed with the quality of the product - I only have one cat who used it and it started coming apart after one day.
3,Disappointed with useless half shelf,"I bought this cat condo a couple of months ago. The quality is okay for the price but it only has a half section shelf in the middle, which is silly, in my opinion, because it's too small to use! The bottom and very top are the only areas that can be used. It's okay for one or two cats only, max."
3,Vertical seam doesn't hold up,I have quite a few cats and they love to scratch on the condo and knock it over and play in it. However I've noticed the vertical seam in the carpet is already coming appart and they love to pick at it. The inside cardboard construction is already coming out too. The cats have been able to pull up a cardboard seam inside and started ripping it out in pieces. I love that the partition doesn't go all the way to the back of the condo so they play with each other inside the condo.
4,cat condo,"The cats really like these, up and down, in and out and snoozing on top. I'd give them 5 stars but think a denser carpet might have been a bit better."
2,shovel was switched for a cheaper model,I ordered the Union Tool #44130 Lady Gardener shovel made in the USA. What I got was a Nature Craft mid-size shovel made in China. It is larger than the one I wanted so I returned it.
3,wabash valley farms,I found it hard to remove from jar (bent spoon) and did not add much flavor. Popcorn tough and chewy.
2,THESE ARE REALLY TINY JARS,I was really surprised when these arrived and the jars were sooo tiny. There are much better deals out there.
4,Good popcorn oil,Helps improve popcorn flavour to be more like theatre style popcorn. Some reviewers suggest using Flavacol popcorn salt which probably helps also.
3,Popcorn oil which isn't greasey,"I first found this product at a shopping outlet store ""Lechef"" It's great for popcorn makers which you don't want greasey popcorn. It doesn't have salt in it so if you like salt, just add that with the oil."
3,"Good, but not what I was looking for","When I purchased the popcorn oil, I was hoping to be able to do away with adding extra butter/butter flavored topping to my homemade popcorn. While the product performed well, the popcorn was colored a bit and tasted fine, I found that using just the Real Theater oil was not enough flavoring for my taste. There is nothing wrong with this product, it's just not for me and I won't be buying it again. I, for one, am sticking with using a decent quality, store-bought vegetable oil, good quality unpopped kernels and I'm going to order the butter flavored popcorn topping offered here at Amazon that comes from the same supplier as this popping oil. I've purchased the topping before, it's very good and for me, it's the way to go. I'm rating the oil 3 stars because it's a fine product, just not what I has wishing it to be."
2,It's VERY yellow,"This stuff tastes OK, but it coats the popcorn with such an unattractive color that it's not very appetizing. We dumped it after a couple batches."
3,Popcorn Oil,"This stuff makes good popcorn, but it makes a mess. It's hard to get it out of the jar without spilling it and it seems to get on everything. Again... has good flavor but it's messy!"
2,It's just ok; Nothing to get excited about..........,"I thought this was all coconut oil but it's notthe taste is plain, I was not impressed. I would rather buy REALCoconut oil.I wont spoil, it taste great, you dont have to refrigate it, andits lower in the bad fat than any other oil including olive oil.It will not make your food taste like coconut.It can stand heat up to 375 degrees without smoking.Be sure and buy the cold pressed coconut oil. Happy popping!"
3,Ok but not great,I purchased this item based on the rave reviews but was disappointed. Maybe my expectations were raised too high. It's not bad but I wouldn't call the taste 'real theater'.
2,Don't get it from Wabash!,"When I got my product it was open?! Not the box it came in, the lid of the product wasn't even closed. They didn't even seal it before sending it to me. DONT GET IT!!!"
3,Good but Bad,"This stuff tastes great, but coconut oil is extremely high in trans-fat...the stuff that sticks to your aeteries..."
1,Not for me,I never used this type of coconut oil before. I'm not crazy about it. I would not recommend.
5,A walk with Truman,"Short, descriptive, life in Brooklyn Heights as seen through Capote's keenest of powers of observation. A lot of space between the lines invites reading between the lines . . . . Plimpton's intro is as Fun as the little book."
4,classic,"Only reason I'm docking it a star is the typically tiresome bloviations of gadabout dilettante Georgie in the introduction. The presence of Georgie between the same covers as Truman might have some value for bulmics, but to me it's just repulsive. Beloved Truman wrote all too little, and Georgie keeps typing, typing, typing! When will it all end?"
4,Nice for the price,"This mount is much cheaper than anything else i have seen on the market. While i think it is specific to the A5, it works quite well on my 98 Custom with some slight adjustments. Over all a very sturdy mount at an outrageously low price."
3,"Not a ""Dial"" Caliper","I was looking for a small, handy caliper for making quick measurements that didn't need batteries. Vernier or Dial would work. This little unit seemed to fit the bill.The box I received is marked '4"" Pocket Dial Caliper', upon opening the box I found a 4"" Digital caliper. It's not what is pictured. Same part number 50008, Chicago Brand.The Caliper looks to be of decent construction and it will work for what I need, I'll just be keeping batteries nearby."
2,No Fractions available,The inch graduations are in tenths of an inch. I found this less useful than fractions of an inch or millimetres. Very few plans call for tenths of an inch and almost all tools and bits are measured in fractions or millimetres. So I don't find many uses for it.
2,Not a bad book,Not worth the money but not a bad book as a quick reference guide. Cheap says it all. But it works.
2,Could have bought it cheaper and brand new!!,"Although the book is in good condition, I have learned, this may not be the way to buy!! Also....Costco sells INCANTO cd/dvd! Cheaper! Amazon makes you think they are the only one who has the cd/dvd!! NOT TRUE......I guess the internet isn't always the way to go on certain things. SAD BUT TRUE!!!"
5,Lover of Books,"A rich film unusually well done.Shows the potential harm of trying to dominate children, but a young girl overcomesit.Same producers as those who produced Anne of Green Gables.Story keeps you involved throughout.Well acted and good cinematography.Don't miss seeing this film. It's a keeper. It makes you think about the highimportance of relationships."
4,Lantern Hill,"Loved this movie growing up. Glad I finally found it on DVD. My only complaints were that the jewel case was broken in several places and the address was to me ""or current resident."" Other than those, I'm happy with my purchase."
2,Poor Reliability/Expensive Junk,This product worked well for 14 months--it was covered by a 12 month warranty. At that time the lock release for the keypad quit working. The company offered to replace the unit for $80. For the price of this unit I expected it to last much longer. The original batteries have lasted longer than the safe.
1,Baby Tramps (being nice!),"As a parent, I find these dolls too sugestive for younger children. I am by no means a conservative, but these babyz are over the line. I find dolls that dress like Fredericks of Hollywood not suitable for younger girls! If you are a parent, think before you buy these dolls. You should not buy these dolls for anyone under 11. And they are not safe for anyone under 4 for choking hazards like one [...]"
1,(....),"I HATE EVERY THING ABOUT THESE UGLY DOLLS! FIRST OFF, THERE FACES ARE REPULSIVE! AND THERE HAIR IS ALL GANGSTERY! THERE BOTTLES COME ON CHAINS AND THEY WEAR BASICLY NOTHING! IF THEY DO WEAR SOMTHING THE COMPANY WILL MAKE SURE IT'S HIDEOUSLY UGLY! BESIDES LOOKING AWFUL, THESE DOLLS DO HORRIBLE THINGS! THEY GET PIERCINGS ALL OVER, TATOOS, AND THEY RIDE ON DEATH MACHIENCES, A.K.A. MOTER CYCLES."
2,Bratz ?,"I think that bratz are the worst! They have flimsy heads that fall off. They have way to much make up on! Bratz are becomeing a sud for barbies. But insted bratz are a horable role modle. They teach kids that shopping and boys are what life is all about. Most girls consider barbies a toy only for little kids because of barbies childish ads and camertials. I think that parents shoud encourage there girls to get into barbie or my scene dolls. I don't know why girls don't like my scene they are in between barbies and bratz, stylish, nice, and are a good roll modle!age 11"
4,Double the fun...but still has flaws,"These Bratz Babies are the cutest dolls that they have made for Bratz Babies so far. They are absolutely divine dolls, and no little girl can resist them! I don't own them, but my dream was these dolls. I think they are just too cute!But beware, I indicate that the Bratz DO dress innaproppriately, and it's not good. I've been playing with Bratz for 4 3/4 years and I'm 11 years old, and my mother doesn't let me get Bratz anymore. I agree, though, because their dress can teach girls that's how they dress. Oh, and do indicate that the devil part of Roxxi is just a funny saying....and, please, read their names and really see why they put the devil and angel there."
5,Your daughter will love them.,Your daughter will love these dolls. They are very huggable and safe for kids 1 1/2 and over.
1,may people can not afford it,these dolls are very expensivethat is why most people can not buy itwe feel very sad that people can not afford itplease change it to eighteen dollars
2,Multi releases of same title,"This is the same 16 track listed as Ultimate Power of Love (1 of 2) Sony 2002. This is the 1996 Madacy/Sony release. Except the artwork, all is the same. The songs are good but this scam isn't cool at all."
4,Power of Love,"I have really enjoyed sitting quietly and listening to this CD. My favorite ""Power of Love"" song has always been by Jennifer Rush. Very romantic CD. To be enjoyed with a glass of wine and someone special."
4,Sit back and relax,This is a very relaxing cd to listen to. Not to mention very romantic too.It has a good variety of music on it. I recommend it for a cozy evening.
4,Lee and Colan hit stride with DD,"Lee and Colan hit their stride with the free-wheeling DD in these early issues (quite different than the later Frank Miller incarnation). Gene Colan probably looked best with Frank Giacoia inking, and this run includes the best of both. This volume also includes annual #1 where DD encounters a string of villains, similar to Spiderman's Sinister Six. Some unfamiliar with these particular issues will probably be surprised by the Mike Murdock sequence--I think it misfired and Lee realized it--that's why he ""killed"" Mike later on. However, it is an interesting digression in DD's history.Overall, another nice volume in the Masterwork series recommended for DD fans."
3,not what I expected,"I was very excited to get Kettle Korn that could be made fresh. I have tried recipes for it on my own, and could not master it. Well I'm not sure Wabash Farms has mastered it either. It does come out nice and crunchy, but just not close to the taste of the Kettle Corn I get at the Fair. I would suggest buying a small box first to see what you think."
1,poor packaging,"Amazon's packaging really bad, Frst time I ordered this - no packaging or protection for product, arrived torn all to pieces and product damaged. I called Amazon, said they would send again properly. Same thing the second shipment, no packaging or protection, just thrown in the box, arrived ripped all to pieces, and product all over box. Don't understand Amazon not caring how their product arrives....."
2,Too amateurish: this can't be Andre Norton,"I was disappointed in the book. If I were Andre Norton, I would not want my name associated with it. I had high hopes when I purchased it -- I love stories about horses and I loved the early Witch World novels. Although the book was ""readable"" and somewhat interesting, the style was VERY amateurish -- not at all written in Andre Norton's style. It was entirely predictable -- nothing to draw one feverishly to the end. While reading a well-written book, the words will tend to disappear and one finds oneself immersed in the story. Sadly, the words never quite disappeared while reading this story."
5,Keplian,This is one of my favorite Norton books. I have read all of them several times and some more than that. Love the animal/human interaction
2,Reveiw,"Did not realize that it DID NOT HAVE ANY MUSIC on it until it arrived and read on it in VERY FINE PRINT, Contains No Music!!!"
4,Wow. Intense!,"The cover largely sums this book up. A group of kids, coming home at night, think they'll take the shortcut home. You know - the shortcut? Over the train tracks? Sure, they're not supposed to, but nobody will ever know, right? What could POSSIBLY go wrong?This is apparently based upon an actual incident from Mr. Crews' life. I can believe it - the kids in the book laugh and giggle and joke and do just about everything *but* concentrate on getting home safe and sound. (That's how they ended up so late they decided to take a shortcut in the first place, I suppose.) And they got a valuable lesson - lucky nobody ended up hurt!This story might be a bit scary for some younger children. Consider your kid before you read it. (For that matter, it might be scary for some adults!) But if your kid will read it, it's a very exciting story with a clear and obvious moral - sometimes, there's REALLY a good reason you're not supposed to do something, so don't be stupid."
5,Excellent appraisal of an overlooked formation,"Whilst the bare outline of the existence of Polish troops in NW Europe during the 1944/45 campaign is known by many, Mr McGilvray's book puts 'flesh on the bones'.The author is to be praised for his insight into the background to the formation of the division, and interwar Polish politics. The creation, equipping and training of the division is covered in great detail, followed by an exhaustive account of the campaign in NW Europe, mostly based on Polish and German language sources.The text is complemented by over 100 photos, reproduced very clearly and aided by the book's large format.Overall, a praiseworthy effort to delve deeper into the tangled web of Polish involvement in the Allied cause during WWII.I must add that contrary to another review on Amazon.com of this book, I found the book well laid-out and free from many noticeable errors!"
2,dishonor,"Gabriel Garcia Marquez's book of a Chronicle of a death foretold is a breath taking experience that will mesmerize you. It will make your right guard turn left. It's about how a set of twins must avenge their family name. How dishonoring one's family can foretell a person's death. The author takes you through a rollercoaster of events that are foretold in the beggining of the book. Once you've started you can't put his book down. It's more shocking then a shocker! We felt that we could not connect to the book because it wasn't a book for us teenagers (waise,chirs,gabe,alvaro,J.P., and me). But overall it was ok. Ater emphisizing what the twins went through, we could understand the reason for wanting to get revenge.amir waise chris gabe alvaro J.P.P.s. If you wanna be hip and down like us ... ur gonna have to read this book to know what we're talking about"
1,terrible book that leaves me with a bad taste afterwards,"I had to read this book for my eleventh grade honors english class. I love to read when given a good book, however this has been one of the worst books that I have ever had to read for school. This year in class we have read The Great Gatsby (5 stars out of 5), Death of a Salesman (3/5), Fences (4/5), Winesburg, Ohio (1/5), and now this. It has no conclusion, is immensely boring, and I could not stand reading it! With books like these, it's no wonder that so many kids prefer video games and television to reading (with the exception of Harry Potter). Save your time and money and do not read this book."
3,EEhhhhh.,"I hate to give less than a stellar review to Gabriel Garcia Marquez who was absolutely brilliant in his writing of ""Love in the Time of Cholera,"" but this story was simply mediocre. It's set up as though there is some mystery to be solved by the end of the book. Unfortunately, the reader is left hanging.The story is about a murder that is revisited 27 years later in an attempt to understand the reasons and circumstances, yet, the reader never learns anything. It promises a twist but never delivers.It did have its moments as there is no doubt that Marquez is a wonderfully descriptive author, but I feel that overall, this is a story without consequence that in many ways leaves one saying, ""EEhhhh...could've been better.""If you've never read Marquez, don't go for this one because of it's slim physique and somewhat catchy title...go for broke and read ""Love in the Time of Cholera"" or ""One Hundred Years of Solitude""...it is within the pages of these books that the author truly shines."
5,"Short, powerful, surprising","It is a very short novel, actually more of a long ""short story"" than a novel.Eventhough we know the outcomes of the protagonists from the first few pages and while the book is supposed to have no surprises - it is actually captivating, with powerful depictions of human nature, mysterious and (without ruining anything by way of disclosure) - Marquez still manages to astonish the reader."
4,Marquez at his best,"A tight narrative with all the imagery one would expect from Marquez. You won't know you are being led into the role of accomplice until your finished and lean back and ask the question, what was this book about. I recommend it to those who are sick of labored novels."
3,good but confusing,"I thought this book was okay. However, in order for me to really understand it I had to make a list of all the characters because there were so many. That was the confusing aspect of the book. Also, the plot was told right at the beginning and the ending was therefore plain because of that. It's a good book if you like murder mysteries."
2,WHAT WAS THE POINT EXACTLY?,Not sure I understood the point of this book. It was obviously about a chap murdered by two other chaps and was a slow blow by blow account - taken on through the eyes of various observers. But it got me thinking - why do writers write about the things they write about?Why present this tale to us?Perhaps it was an unburdening of his soul - or some sort of epitaph to someone he knew - a memorial of sorts.What ever it was I did not in the least find it uplifiting or edifying. Perhaps books are not always meant to deliver these aspects - but I can only speak as I feel; and I felt a bit empty after reading this.
5,One of my faves!,This is one of the few books I remember enjoying during high school English. A perfect example of magical realism and Gabriel García Márquez's brilliant writing!
4,Short but amazing,"Marquez has always gripped me and this is no exception. It is a little short, but it all books had this much character development, I would save many hours in my life.If you haven't read it - you must"
4,"Puzzling, but enchanting.","I read this book piecemeal, but even though I would be away for it for days at a time, I had to come back -- and the last 30 pages or so made me drop everything to read them. *Chronicle* is one of those books that left me confused, but convinced of its beauty. Unlike a detective novel (a genre it is playing against), in which the people killed are devoid of personality -- in which we can barely bring ourselves to care about them -- the prolongued death of Santiago Nasar, as seen through everyone's eyes, in the end, through our eyes, becomes all the more shattering despite of and because we knew all along it would happen."
2,Very Well Written Book About a Simple Minded Idiot,"I just don't get this book. It's well written, but it's about an idiot caught up in a land of idiots. Supposedly, it's a honor killing. But he's just an idiot. I suppose that entering the mind of an idiot can be interesting, but we don't enter idiot's mind. We just watch the idiot mindlessly act like an idiot. 2 stars for style, 0 stars for content. A real disappointment after the great One Hundred Years of Solitude."
2,"Interesting Plot, Poor Writing","I felt like the plot of this book was interesting enough. I always like a good story about a murder. However, I was not impressed by Marquez's writing style. I felt that the book was really too...short or fast paced, which made the book much more difficult to read. If the book was just a little longer, and Marquez took a chance to tell the story much more slowly, then I wouldn't have had so many problems with this book."
4,A Traditional Circular Narrative,"This book is a traditional example of circular narrative. Although that type of narrative can be used to keep the reader interested, it did not occur in this novel. The form of circular narrative used made the book more difficult to read because the reader continued to say ""I know this already."" However, overall, it was fairly good."
4,Disappointing,"Throughout the book, I expected there is something more than the mere recall of events. There are too many questions left unanswered. The only satisfatory part of the book is the story about Angela."
4,"Lively, colorful and engaging","This book by Gabriel Garcia Marquez is different from his other books. On the surface, it's a thriller, in the middle of which is a homicide. Supposedly, a very ordinary story, expect for one small detail. The ending of the story is well known from the first sentence. The murderers tell everyone in the village about their intention to murder Santiago Nasar. Soon enough, the rumor spreads around and the entire village knows about it. And yet, despite the widespread awareness in the village of the Vicario brothers' plan to murder Nasar, he is still murdered. This is a very witty and full of humor of book. Marquez's writing is very lively and lucid, and ought to be enjoyed by any of Marquez's fans out there."
5,A hard-to-put-down novel,"This novel is certainly written by an author who had full control of his story. It is an easy read, once you get passed the character's names, and you soon realise that you've been caught up in a delima which puts the question back on to the reader-what would I have done in this situation?"
5,Exactly what I wanted!,Book was in the shape I requested. I wanted something with a lot of notes and this book was so helpful for my class!
3,Disturbing yet enthralling,"Even though i knew from the beginning of the book that Santiago Nasar was going to be murdered, i still wanted him to survive and was hoping that somehow the ending would change. The thing that makes this book disturbing is the unexplainable coincedences and the way friends can do nothing to stop the death of Santiago. The most disturbing part was when Santiago's mother was the one who unknowingly closed the door in front of her son cutting off his escape."
1,Love the movie,I love this movie but the dvd was not made from an original tape of the movie.It would not play on my dvd player. I sent it back & got a refund.
2,Open letter to all who love 80's style mini series,"Will make this a short and sweet letter, this is boring and has none of the trashy glamour of Scruples of even Lace for that matter, it's an 80's mini series for heaven's sake! Camp it up people!!!!! This tries too hard to be BBC-esque, which is fine I love a good BBC production, but my goodness this was produced in the 80's, the last decade of the fun, enjoyable mini series and this one ended the decade on a sour note in my opinion, I've watched the first disc and doubt I will continue on...SNOOZEFEST!Lest we forget the acting, Claudette Colbert is outstanding, Ann Margaret is fine, but Stephen Collins better thank the Lord every day that he is gorgeous because at least in this movie, he CANNOT act his way out of a wet paper bag."
1,Can't play these cheap DVDs,"Tried to play this on five DVD players, not one would play it. It's made for players only but I put it in players, DVD-Roms, portable DVD, Blu-Ray, nothing worked. Beware this is a poorly made product."
3,a couple things a missing and unacurate,"its a good skeleton to review for anatomy and physiology, but it is missing its squamous suture that is suppose to separate the parietal bones from the temporal bones, also the clavicle is too straight, a real clavicle is more curved, the hyoid bone was broken when i received it to. otherwise everything else is pretty good and the shipping was quick"
4,Peter Pan Returns to Never Land,"Quite pleased with this; I purchased it for the grands, and they love it. Would definitely recommend it to those who love Peter Pan."
4,Um.......I Don't know,"I like this movie and I don't like this movie. Like my dad I LOVE PETER PAN. I've read the book a million times over, and I was really excited when I saw the previews for this movie. My family saw it in the theaters and I really liked it at first. But after seeing a few times more then it got a little cheesy. The music doesn't really fit the movie and Peter acted more like a kid than ever( even though he's not suppose to grow up they could have made him have more brains than that). This movie is good but it has some parts that are embarressly kiddish. Out of the three squels I think disney did a good job on this one would be second place."
5,"Great movie all u need is faith, trust & pixie dust!!!","This is the best movie i have seen in a long time , My kids watch it aleast 3 times a day .. They love it that much ..i have never like disney Sequels before ever ....TILL this one This one rocksMy kids love the soundtrack also .. they have some great songs on this movie..don't listin to all those bad reviews.. all you need is faith , trust & pixie dust :O) then give this movie a shot .. i'm sure you will love this one ..."
5,I thought this movie was a good flick and so did my sister,"I have never been a Peter Pan fan. I thought Peter was corny. I found this video in my house and I popped it in my vcr and started watching. I had negative thoughts in mind but I watched the whole movie. This movie was pretty good and people stop complaining about the voices, they were fine. Give those actors some credit! I really think this one topped the classic. I mean it is more modern and who needs a boring old classic? I liked this one better and now I became a Peter Pan/Cap'n Hook fan!!"
2,THE MUSIC DOES NOT FIT THE MOVIE,"This is a good follow up to Peter Pan story but the songs employed -- the style and the singers - are for today and do not fit with the movie. The story takes place during WWII and in the timeless Neverland. The songs, and the singers, are blatantly comptemporary. Even the closing theme does not match the movie. I was VERY disappointed with this feature. If it were not for this inconsistency, I would have rated this movie five stars."
4,Just what my 5 year old wanted,My five year old saw a preview for this movie on one of her other movies and really wanted it. She has watched it over and over.
4,Worth seeing..,"I don't believe Disney has ever made a sequel that lived up to the magic of the original film. That said, some sequels are better than others and this is one of the better ones. I think this movie was very good mainly because it didn't ""re-do"" the original story in reverse (like Lady & the Tranp 2 or Little Mermaid 2) or try to lamely continue the old one (Cinderella 2, Jungle Book 2). This is a new story with a new heroine, and stands on its own merits.Wendy's daughter doesn't believe. She has had to grow up fast in a world where her father is off to war and London is under seige. So when Captain Hook kidnaps her thinking she is Wendy, she needs to learn how to believe again. And that belief will give her family hope. An uplifting story, filled with adventure and familiar characters. It's not as good as the original, but is definitely worth watching."
3,Worth one return,"Well, the kids enjoyed it, and I thought it was nice for one viewing. We get to revisit the whole gang from the first movie, and they now throw in Wendy's kids, as she's now grown up and has popped out a few. Peter Pan has still not grown up, Captain Hook is still quite mean, especially for a kid's feature, Tinkerbell is still a babe, and The Lost Boys seem to have been lost when they were giving out brains.However, it's basically the same plot all over again. Only substitute Wendy's daughter, who is at first mistaken for Wendy by those who don't understand the concept of aging. Virtually nothing new happens once we meet the old gang, except that Captain Hook has a new nemesis to replace the crocodile. And there is not one memorable song.Not too bad, but not too good, either."
4,Peter Pan in Return to Never Land(Pixie-Powered Edition).,This movie came to me in like new condition.It was not the version that I was looking for but I will keep it and keep looking for the first one.I know my Grandkids and the GreatGrand Kids will like it also.It is a interesting movie to watch and i am happy with it.
3,Return to Neverland,What started out so well fell short and disappointing when Wendy's daughter reaches Neverland. It didn't really keep the excitement of the first one.
2,Rather short with little plot,"I'm not really a fan of the old Disney ""classics"" (Dumbo, Peter Pan, stuff like that), because I find them a little bit boring. This was done in that style, so of course, I didn't like it much. The start is sort of interesting, as it takes place during WWII in London, when the children are being sent to the country. But after that, it sort of becomes plotless and short, and rehashes a lot from the original ""Peter Pan"". At least it's appropriate for children, though. So, if you really like those old animated Disney films, you'll probably like this. But if you don't, look somewhere else."
1,dosen't add up.,The 1st Peter Pan took place during Edwardian England.(1910s. Before WWI). During WWII Wendy should be a grandmother not a mother in her early 20s. Even the geniuses at Disney should be able to add.
1,Military Fam hated it!,I have a sweet 5 year old girl and a 2 1/2 year old boy. Their father is deployed and DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE to any military families!!!! As a mother I should have viewed it first but I thought....I love Disney movies and that's all we watch and it's rated G! The main character Jane was a little too much for me. I kept thinking...please don't let my little girl immitate Jane. Not to mention the opening is a family saying goodbye to their father going off to war. Hit too close to home and my daughter doesn't understand 'war'. Did I already mention that I did not like the Jane character or the movie?
2,"Beautiful art, uneven stories and scholarship","This beautifully presented book, with its lovely art printed on fine paper, seduces the buyer into thinking that it will be a perfect Seder companion. But, though it has useful information, its scholarship is only randomly reliable. Kimmel is unaware of the primary symbolism of the roasted egg, imagines that Ashkenazic Jews refrain from serving lamb at their Seders only because it was absent from their diets in eastern Europe and, in a misbegotten stab at ecumenism, makes the astonishing assertion that ""theExodus is as important for Christians as it is for Jews."" The book can make a pleasant addition to the Passover meal if it's served with a grain of salt."
3,Fun from the 70s,"This is a fun film if you like movies from the 70s. It has minimal effects and production values, but it is quite entertaining. I saw this one when I was a kid, so I may be a little biased. The film always stuck with me and I'm glad to see it's found a place on DVD. Check it out if you like the atmosphere of a fun 70s drive-in type movie!"
3,Horror on High,"Horror High (1974) is silly, bloody, gory, and fake. In a bad way. A Bad movie. Just plain bad. Nothing to see here, but don't move along.The direction is excitingly pitiable, the acting is indifferent, the effects are marked by a lack of interest, and I can easily go on about all the inadequate elements of this mess. No aspect of this thing comes close to being favorable.But, this 70's exploitation film shines out as the type of bad entertainment people loved back then.Horror High - 35 Anniversary DVD Release:On-camera interview with Lead star Austin StokerUncut for the first timeComedy commentary with TV's ""Beat the Geeks"" J. Keith Van Straaten, Marc Edward Heuck, and Paul GoebelCode Red trailersOriginal theatrical trailerBonus footage shot for TV on the TWISTED BRAIN releaseBrand New 16x9 (1.85:1) Print Mastered in HiDef from the original 35mm dupe negatives from Crown International's vault"
4,Mo-tzu:Great Philosopher or intellectual guerrilla?,"The book on the philosophy of Mo-tzu was interesting at first.His views against aggresive warfair,against expensive funerals,and choosing worthy people are all right.As for his views against music and on ghosts are debatable.And on universal brotherhood may sound good but a bit too unrealistic even though well meaning.But what really got my goat was his cruel,false and malliciousattacks against Confucius and his followers.He tells false stories about Confucius that scholars say didn't exist.He makes him look like the essence of evil.Perhaps Mo-Tzu should be called ""The Jealous Rival of Confucius!"
3,Gentle Giant,"A bluntly honest book of the last decade of De Kooning and his paintings. The author's analysis tells of the decline of De Kooning's mental facualities and how others coaxed him into continuing his painting, to the point of choosing the colors or his palette and drawing the design on the canvas. It reports that his work of the late 80's might stretch the credibility of his own creative integrity.His paintings during the early 80's challenge our previous concepts of De Kooning's paintings and the book helps expand our appreciation of this gentle giant of art. The book is sad but a also a reaffirmation of the contributions of a genius at any age."
2,First Off,"There were 4 short films to make up this movie and all but one were difficult to sit all the way thorough. I kept telling myself to turn it off but I kept thinking it would get better, sadly it never really did. Other than the 3rd short story that I found had a good story with a surprising ending all the others were not worth my time.In my opinion do not spend your time or money on this one."
4,good value,A lot of music for the price. The acoustic was a surprise. Reminds me of Roy Orbitson and/or Eddie Raven. Good CD
3,shrug,"This album feels trite and simplistic after hearing - or should I say experiencing - his more recent album ""The True False Identity"". It's good for an old-timey pat on the back, but has none of the ironic sting and interesting soundscapes of the later album, which maintains his trademark roots in Americana and acoustic sound and combines them with rich lyrics and storytelling. Go get it."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"I am a HUGE fan of T-Bone from back in his Alpha Band days but, honestly, I didn't like this CD. In fact, it is his only recording I don't really like. I'll guess that country music fans would like it better. As usual with Burnett, the lyrics are great."
4,T-Bone goes acoustic,"Long tall Texan T-Bone Burnett has one of those nasal, Dylanish voices that you might call an acquired taste. Still, once you've gotten past that initial barrier to entry, you're hooked. On this eponymous release, T-Bone takes the neotraditional high road: there's not an electrified note to be heard. Instead he's assembled an acoustic ensemble to die for, including dobro wizard Jerry Douglas, fiddler Byron Berline, and Los Lobos' Dave Hidalgo. The songs--particularly ""River of Love"" and ""Shake Yourself Loose""--are smart, lovely, and low-key. And even the bits that T-Bone clearly tossed off on the way to the studio receive eloquent performances. Jerry Douglas fans, please note: the disc includes two unaccompanied, CD-only tracks by the Slide Ruler himself, who makes Burnett's melodies sound more desolate and Appalachian than usual. Beautiful!"
3,"Good, but not entirely correct","Most formats are correct, however screenwriters get short shrift, the chapter on feature film scripts is woefully incorrect. It says a screenwriter should use scene numbers and cont'd's, which to anyone besides an out and out neophyte, is totally WRONG. The sections on short forms and novel length manuscripts is spot on. Altogether, an excellant guide to manuscript formatting for fiction and non-fiction formats but screenwriters are advised to look elsewhere."
4,"The song "" What sin?"" is so very anointed and beautiful.","We are using the song ""What Sin?"" in our Post Abortion Bible study. We feel it has God's healing hand all over it."
3,Mellow rocker rides the fence on breaking new ground.,"A career of innocuous ""hit"" singles makes for an innocuous ""best of"" album. Still, the inclusion of earlier butt-kickers like the militant ""Pray in the USA"" and dance rock ""Carried Away"" make this collection worthy of purchase, especially since those tunes cannot be found anywhere else on CD. And the title track is a classic heart-wrencher that will never lose its impact or freshness. Two new tracks add a little more depth to the collection, particularly ""Cool of the Day"" which sounds very much like it could have been released by the Wonders from the movie, ""That Thing You Do"". Morgan Cryar has a great rock and roll voice, but plays it safe in the studio rather than taking risks and testing his limits. Consequently, this compilation is a good listen, but not a compelling one."
3,"Incomplete ""Best of"".","Although this is a nice set of songs, and a good intro to his music, their 'best of' leaves a lot to be desired. Missing are the hits: ""A Few of My old Friends"", ""Sibling Rivalry"" and ""Underneath Your Feet"" (the video is on Youtube). The inclusion of stinkers like ""Koombayah"",. ""Carried Away"" and ""Kingdom Upside Down"" (even if it was the title track) are unfathomable. If they wanted a good title track, try ""Love Over Gold"". I do like the two new cuts, though, at least the 30 sec worth that I listened to. I will probably download them.Thankfully, I have all of his older stuff on CD and can transfer the songs I like to a CD. I have to admit that one of my guilty pleasures was ""I Need the Rock"" from 'Fuel on the Fire' (my favorite cassette).My rating is actually 3.5, but leaving out 3 topnotch songs (that were played on Christian Radio A LOT) like I mentioned above made me go with 3 over 4."
5,This book has everything!!!,"I have to say that I felt that the book was a little hard to follow due to several plot lines. However, the action and emotions evoked throughout more than made up for that. There is so much going on with Sam and Alyssa that I can't wait to read about them in the next SEAL installment. I was driving myself crazy to finish the book beacause I really felt for the characters. Ms. Brockmann can really make the reader feel the emotions of the characters so it's as if you are in the middle of all the action. It's truly remarkable when a writer can evoke one's imagination in that manner. I sincerely think this book would make a wonderful movie and would give Tom Clancy a run for his money. There is action, romance, and everything in between. Men and women alike would enjoy seeing this at the movies."
5,Wow! Three love stories in one,"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. It was a ""I can't put it down!"". The author successfully interwove two love stories and laid the groundwork for more.I fell in love with all of the SEAL team members myselfEve's story that she told to Amy was wonderful!GREAT Book! Great Plot!I highly recommend it for anyone who loves romance and action men! In fact, I'm planning on getting the complete set for my friend for Christmas. She'll love these SEAL's too.Sue"
3,The Defiant Hero,"The United States refuses to negotiate with terrorists. Meg Moore remembered the warning from her job as a translator in a European embassy. Those same words spell out a death sentence for her daughter and grandmother who have been kidnapped by a lethal group called the Extremists. Meg will do anything to meet their unspeakable demands, anything - even kill - to save her child.When Navy SEAL John Nilsson is sumoned to Washington DC by the FBI to help negotiate a hostage situation, the last person he expects to see holding a foreign ambassador at gunpoint is Meg. He hasn't seen her for years, but he's never forgotten how it feels to hold her in his arms. John could lose his career if he helps her escape. She will lose her life if he doesn't...."
5,review of the defiant Hero,A good book with a lot of suspense. I plan to read all of the others in this series. The product came came in great condition with no problems would buy from this vendor again
5,The Defiant Hero,This book was another chapter in the seal teams seriesMs Brockmann has created. I enjoyed it. I like thecharacters she has created and the secondary stories she co-mingles with the modern story. She combines the mild thriller with romance and makes it enjoyable. Great escapist reading.
4,Sukhavati,"I borrowed this from Netflix and liked it so much that I purchased my own copy. Like many Joseph Campbell publications, this is packed with information that can only be absorbed slowly."
4,Pleased,This is my intro to Joseph Campbell. I'm happy to have the cd in my collection. It does a great job of explaining how we are all connected through the undercurrent of belief systems.
3,Sukhavati,"The products condition and it's delivery were excellent. I would not suggest this video, but would direct others to the Bill Moyer's Interviews with Joseph Campbell, ""Joseph Campbell & the Power of Myth"". The message in Sukhavati is beautiful but the video techniques, music paired with scenery, seems a little dated and runs a bit too long. But, that's just my opinion. Nonetheless Joseph Campbell is still amazing to listen to."
5,Basic step in understanding human mind,"Basic step in understanding human mind, with Campbell everybody understand many things abouut himself and the others."
2,Disappointed,Although the visuals on this DVD were stunning the material was poorly organized and there was little coherency in the message. I was disappointed
4,This book presents Matthew for today's audience,"When reading the Scriptures, many have a hard time understanding certain things because we are not in the culture and time of the authors. However, this book bridges this gap and brings scripture to life using Matthew. I was able to understand my faith in new light after reading this.The only real down side of this book is the explanation of the Eucharist in the last supper as a symbol. The wording is a little ambigious and might lead Catholics away from truth if not read carefully. The Eucharist is Jesus Christ, re-presented in body, blood, soul, and divinity."
1,light use only - it will kill your drives..,"I purchased two of these enclosure 3 months ago, and two 250GB hard drives to go in them. The unit is very nice and it was easy to install the drive within the enclosure. They have these no screw clips that you pop onto the drive and then slide it into the case. I turned it on and my Mac saw it right away.Unfortunately the rest is down hill. My first use for these drives was to backup my system. Within about 30 minutes of continuous use the drives will overheat in this enclosure and become unusable. Therefore backups is not a reasonable use for these drives.I don't know if it is as a result of the high heat or not, but the plastic no-screw clips have all broken too, since I have been using these cases. I had to discard the cases, they were not usable for my intended use."
2,Quiet but burns out my HD,"A Seagate 200GB drive died due to overheating. Maybe other drives will work, but beware...."
4,"A few missed opportunites, but a very strong effort.","Pretty good film overall. I did not feel Madeinusa was ""culturally insensitive"" or racist as other reviewers have suggested. I did, however, think the writing was at times amateurish--which may have created an unintentional result of bigotry. There were moments that I absolutely LOVED, and Magaly Solier (lead role) was very convincing and powerful. I did feel that there were a few lost opportunities. It seemed to me that there were too many close-ups and not enough wide establishing shots to capture the powerful qualities the setting. Overall, I really enjoyed the film and was left thinking about it much more than I anticipated--a nice blend of beauty and darkness. Strong effort!!"
1,A Very Racist Movie,"This movie portrays an extremely negative, sadistic and morbid picture of indigenous people of Peru. I have no doubts that peruvian indigenous culture has it's downfalls, but I feel that a critique of it's society should not come from an elitist white Peruvian who lives in Europe. This movie is part of the history of using film to inseminate and reproduce cultural ignorance, prejudice and racial superiority.It's unfortunate that the spectacle- beautiful cinematography, colors, sounds- mesmerizes most audiences without eliciting any real critique. I'm amazed that it's won so many festivals and received so much attention. This is very telling on how very racist our world and the media, even indymedia, is."
1,IT IS A RED STONE!,When the ring arrived it was not all the nice salmon/peach coral color you see on the picture. It was bright red and I returned it immediately.
4,Being vs Becoming,"Challenging read for someone not too familiar with psych jargon, but very managable for anyone with a few psychology courses under his or her belt. This book will definitely assist one in their endeavors to define self-actualization on a personal/internal level. I feel that after a deliberate reading I personally gained some insight about my true nature. Maslow does an outstanding job of clarifing for the reader what it is like to veiw the world as its own ends versus the means. He helps define how living a life of being differs from a life of becoming. Good book, I highly recommend it to anyone in a counselling profession or one seeking philisophical enrichment."
3,How could this book possibly cost $50?,This book was not written as a textbook - it was written as a standard work of non-fiction. 15 years ago it cost $8. How can they charge $50 for it?I believe we have to take these factors into account when discussing the merits of a book. This price is really out of hand.
1,Fish Sticks,I never knew how I managed to order this when I was placing a large order of another book. By accident I suppose. I sent the bppl back and my money was refunded. Therefore I didn't read the book and can't really put a rating on it.
4,b,this book was purchased from Amazon. It came on time and was in great condition. I would buy from this seller again
3,Sustaining change in your organization.,"A short book about change in a hospital setting. It was an OK book about how companies need to make and sustain change and keep the organization fresh. It is all about helping and serving your customer base. If you have read one of these books, you get the idea behind what is trying to be focused on in sustaining excellence.This is an OK book. It is a short read, and should not take long, and perhaps you will get some ideas on how to use change to facilitate excellence."
4,Good Catch,This little book provided great examples of how any of us can apply the Fish! Philosophy to our own work settings whether large or small. Well done!
5,A great read at the 1 year mark after Fish! 1,"As a manager in a government agency, I utilized the first Fish! book with our team as a part of our Manager's meeting last year this time. It was widely regarded as the best meeting we've ever had. Everyone loved it. Everything that the first book indicated would happen did. It was really pretty awesome. We are now widely regarded as the the best shops in the state, largely because of the practices we put in place with the first book.We are in the planning stages of this year's manager meeting, and I was looking for a topic for the meeting. Fish! Sticks fits the bill perfectly. Ironically, we were at a point where we were just going to cob some boring presentation together because we had reached exactely the point that this book talks about where we have sorta gotten back to our own ways, prior to the change.This one evening read was just what the Dr. ordered! I strongly recommend the entire set for folks in managerial positions."
4,Includes bonus tracks,"Great album. As a six song EP it's good, as a 21 song album it's incredible. Looking for Waikiki (out of print)? It's on here. Fluf's cover of 'Girlfriend in a Coma'? It's on here. The only problem I have is the price. The CD itself says pay no more than $5. I got mine at a show for that price... maybe you should too..."
3,More of a Shaman Board,"I barely used this one once and probably should have returned it. I'm not saying this board is ineffective, however, I don't feel comfortable using a board that a Shaman or someone well-versed in Indian practices would be more qualified to use respectfully."
4,If you rescue me,This soundtrack is like the movie: amazing! And the song If You Rescue Me is the best one!
5,A must read for the thinking person!,"Can be purchased directly from the author's community: Koinonia Partners, Inc. 1324 GA Hwy 49 South Americus GA 31709 (912)924-0391 Also many other books and cassettes by same author. (Even supposed out-of-print!)"
1,Mockery,"I think that no person that even thinks of him/herself as being a christian should study this 'bible'. In my opinion it is a very huge mockery of Christ and his life and doings here on earth. I have not personally read the book, but i have heard about it. And as a christian i don't even think it should be thought of like that book puts it, much less on shelves for anybody to be influenced by it."
1,Information provided is just DEAD WRONG,"The reservoir and Cap are NOT, I repeat NOT!!! included.Seller: Pro Parts USA says it's Amazon's fault for using a generic photo and description. I don't care who's fault it is. I paid for a reservoir and cap and received none. I couldn't let my car sit with no brakes any longer, so I installed it and used the old reservoir.Master cylinder is made in Italy and appears to be very good quality even though I did get screwed. Make sure your master cylinder is the one with three holes and not two. This one has four holes and only came with one plug. I had to do some creative engineering to fill the other hole.So far it's working great. But I still got screwed!!!"
5,Wonderful,I read the second and third books in this series first and just got around to this one. It's a great opening to a wonderful trilogy.
2,HNot as big as expected,"The dimensions given in the item description sound nice, but those are the outside measurement of the top, or open area, up by the handles. The sides taper to make the bottom less by a couple of inches. I was going to use these for desk-side paper recycle baskets for sheets of printer paper but they just aren't big enough."
1,bad product,"sorry, it wreaks your laptop stero sound, it is really not design for a laptop,when you found out it dont work it looks retarded, i freed my poor laptop for this device"
4,An Alternative view for moms,"The review by the previous listener who was, dissapointed that this recording, received as a gift, is opera was apparently looking for ""soothing"" music (possibly elevator music)to put her and possibly her child-to-be to sleep. I agree - if jello is what you seek, do not purchase this disc. If, on the other hand, you seek passion, beauty, and possibly a widening of your musical horizons, do, by all means, purchase this disc. Soaring arias, heavenly voices and the most lovely music imaginable await you. Still, Richard Clayderman and Britney Spears are available to you and your unfortunate child."
3,wish there was a hole,I really wish there was a hole already in the nipple. I finally got a hole to go through the very thick tip and then it would just run out and choke the baby. The other holes were so small and my baby did not know how to suck well so that did not work. I just went to a syringe. If you can get a decent hole in these without ruining the whole nipple they may be a good thing...
5,Just what I needed....,These nipples were exactly what I needed for the baby squirrel I fostered. I did cut the nipple and it let WAY too much formula out - using a hot needle is the perfect way to open up the hole.
2,Mostly common sense. Why buy common sense?,"I'm a big fan of Clark Howard and his other books and radio show. They contain oodles of great money saving info. Clark's radio show and books have saved me well over $900 this year with useful info I did not know about. However, this book was a letdown.Most everything in this book was common knowledge or common sense. Example: Want cheap clothes, then buy them from a thrift store or discount store like TJ Maxx. Want cheap books, borrow them from the library, or buy them used on the internet. Too often the answer is buy used, or buy at a warehouse club.I can't recommend this book unless you are a novice at saving money. You are better off saving your money and buying Clark's far superior book, ""Get Clark Smart: The Ultimate Guide to Getting Rich in America"", which despite its title is not a get rich quick book. That book has all sorts of useful and less known money saving ideas, and a lot of information on how to avoid getting ripped off."
2,not satisified,"I have to agree with the other reviewer. I listen to clark Howard as often as I can so I was very disappointed by this book. If you listen to the show and consider yourself relatively frugal anyways, you probably will not learn anything from this book. A lot of it seems like common sense to me."
3,The small screwdrivers are shoddy,"I tried to use the smallest Phillips screwdriver to unscrew my car key fob, and the small screw drivers are of such poor quality that the screwdriver head was stripped, as well as the screw to my key fob. The screw driver I used was exactly the same size as the screw, so it should have been able to unscrew it with no issues.I haven't used any other tools from this box, but for the most part, they other tools seem sturdy."
4,Ideal tool set for the condo and vacation home,"I've got three of these sets; one for my young son who just married and moved into a condo, one in my vacation home and the third to me to keep in the closet for small home items. It is a decent value for the money, and proves invaluable when you need a wrench or hammer at a moment's notice."
5,"safe and so helpful for breathing, relaxing and stretching!!! Spanish too!!!","this is a great pregnancy yoga tape in english and spanish. helps with breathing, relaxation and stretching/strengthening for labor and birth!!! Loved it!!!"
4,Dry Clean Only!,Seems nice but I wish I had known it was to be dry cleaned only :( That will be difficult with a new baby and pets.
3,More green than blue in this teal,"I expected more of a grayish blue based on Amazon image, but they were more green when I received. The coverlet is nice and soft, and came with a price tag on the cover that stated it was originally $79.99. A good deal if you are looking for more green tones - I wasn't - but I guess my toddler son won't care if his coverlet doesnt match his sheets!"
3,a little less good,"Had to drill new holes for the seat(3a probably older I bought used), but the mods to fit the holes to fit it to the car are more extensive(left side much less). Still a great price and great materials(good weld,good steel), just be ready to mod. This was done on a 1991 s13 chassis, and we didn't try it on an s14."
3,Trouble at the 87th,"The men of the 87th precinct are being sent strange, cryptic messages from ""The Deaf Man"" who issues guarded warnings about a disruptive event which is about to take place, but couches these warnings in the form of pages from a sci-fi novel. The event is actually a huge rock/rap fest where thousands will be present at an outdoor venue. Much of this story centres on a rap group and the author offers a few of his examples of this genre, none of which does anything for me personally but...to each his own! The other main story surrounds the murders of graffiti writers who deface public and private buildings with their ugly scrawl and who are now being shot by a person unknown. It ewas an ok story but lacked the zip and sizzle of some earlier ones."
4,Could have been better.,"This book is almost like reading three books in one. One of the stories is about people with Alheimer's Disease who are being abandoned at hospitals all over the city.Another story is about a serial killer who enjoys killing people who like to spray paint on walls.Third--and best of all--is about a man who calls himself the Deaf Man. He is a criminal mastermind. I think McBain would have done better by leaving out the serial killings, which were just being done to cover up another crime, and he should have also left out the Alheimers cases and made the Deaf Man the only story in the book. It was the only story that held my attention. The Deaf Man was intriguing and charismatic, a very clever crimal genious."
3,"The Deaf Man, mayhem, and atrocious rapping!","The Deaf Man and a killer of graffiti writers are the sources of MISCHIEF in this McBain installment. Kling and Parker are pursuing a possible serial killer who is targeting ""writers"" with one victim not quite fitting in, and the Deaf Man makes his return with one of his far-fetched schemes to sew chaos in order to make a big score. The one big mistake in this otherwise solid addition to the series is the McBain's sorry attempt to create a rap band, in this case one called Spit Shine; a band that is important to the plot but is one more example how many writers are ""tone deaf"" to rap. Reading McBain's attempts at rap lyrics are painful to say the least and embarrassing to say the most. Docked a star for the weak lyrics, this is still a good addition to the series."
3,first Project Greenlight winner,"Stolen Summer is Project Greenlight winner Pete Jones' story of a Catholic boy and the Jewish friend he tries to convert in 1976. The plot is interesting, particularly since religion is so rarely mentioned in American film, and Jones' script is okay, if sometimes repetitive. The adult actors (Aidan Quinn, Bonnie Hunt, Kevin Pollak) are excellent, and the film is worth watching if only for its curiosity factor as the first film from the Project Greenlight (PG) group, though it would be more entertaining and informative to watch the PG series in addition to the film.DVD extras include a trailer; Jones' 3-minute PG-winning submission as well as the scene as it was later filmed for theatrical release; a commentary track with writer-director Jones, producer Chris Moore and coproducer Jeff Balis; 2 deleted scenes with commentary."
4,For a first-time director...A VERY GOOD MOVIE!!!,"Pete Jones did a fantastic job directing his first feature-length film. Considering that he had to deal with a lot of B.S. from Miramax, I think it turned out GREAT! I too would like to write a screenplay and have it produced, and I can tell you that it's NOT easy! If my dream comes true as Mr. Jones' dream did, then I hope that my film turns out as well as his! GREAT JOB PETE!!! Can't wait to see your next film!"
1,Don't watch this movie,Shame on the producers. Read the Bible before launching a project like this. Get the facts together. A boy is searching for an answear in how to get to heaven. The Bible is so clear that those who follow Jesus will go to heaven. There is no other way. The movie on the other hand says that anybody can go to heaven as long as you are good and have faith in whatever you want to believe and pray. Jesus is just a symbol. What a lie! what a deception! Don't watch this movie.
2,"Bad Script, Good Direction","Let's just hope that Pete Jones sticks with directing movies instead of writing screenplays. The plot is trite and manipulative ... and PREDICTABLE. But it was still fun to see the finished product after watching the Project Greenlight series on HBO. If you forgive the script, the film-making aspect of the movie is better than I expected. It's still worth your time if you're curious about the way it turned out."
4,movie,i loved this movie which is why i oredered it. took a little longer to ship than i thought but i got it!
5,Wonderful book,"I've been a vegetarian for over 10 years, but my husband is not. This book is great even for the non-vegetarian. There are great pictures, easy instructions, and very unique recipes I haven't seen anywhere else. There aren't just pictures of the end result, but there are pictures of the process also (which is where I often get confused while cooking), so you can be an inexperienced chef, but still create gourmet meals.You make pretty much everything from scratch, which is so healthy and it's also a lot of fun. If you buy one recipe book, this should be it."
5,A must-have for Bush fans,"If you are a fan of Bush, this single is a must-have. Not only does it give you two great live songs, but it also features the ""The Chemicals Between Us"" demo. I love this CD, and highly recommend it."
2,Not for your daily driver,"As the title states in my opinion these should not be used on your daily driver. Car vibrates at idle now that comes through the steering wheel as well as other parts of the car. When the weather warms up, these will probably be jerked out and replaced with new OEM mounts.Don't stray away from OEM parts."
1,DONT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"it is a very cool looking gun but i shot it the first time in my house and it curved up, then the second time it curved down, the third time it went right, and the fourth time it went left. u cant controll wer the bb goes. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Installation limitiation for Ultimate Family Tree,Buyers should know that if their Internet Explorer Browser is NOT version 3 this program will not install. It requires version 3 of IE or version 3 of Netscape. Later versions will not work and the program will refuse to finish installing.
5,Real solutions for future populations,"Village Wisdom is an incredible presentation of real-world solutions for population and environmental issues now faced all over the world. It is a summary of information presented at the thirld international ecocity and ecovillage conference. It must contain about 100 separate reports about projects in cities and rural areas worldwide. Planning without cars, for healthy communities, to solve poverty issues, etc. Someone email me when there is a webpage for it! sand@treevillages.org"
4,Comfortable and Effective Hearing Protection That's Assembled in the USA,"I was pleasantly surprised by how comfortable these hearing protection earmuffs are. The padding used in them is much cushier than the padding in the other earmuffs that I have used.I use this product when I run machinery such as tractors, lawn mowers and weed eaters, and they seem to effectively muffle the loud noises that those machines make.The only thing about this product that seems questionable to me is the metal wire that holds the earpieces onto the headband. I'm not sure how durable it will prove to be, which is the reason that I gave this product four stars instead of five.Amazingly, these hearing protectors are assembled in the USA, not in China! However, they are a product of Sweden that is assembled in the USA. But hey, I'll take it! I was very pleased to see that any portion of the manufacturing process took place in the USA."
3,It's not big enough for my ears and head,"The one size fits all doesn't work. The edges of the cups press against my big old man ears and this hurts after a while; intolerable for use on a flight, of no importance if you're wearing these for a few minutes at a time while making some power saw cuts. Also the range of height adjustment allowed by the frame isn't quite enough for a larger head. Maybe my head is outlandishly big, I don't know. It could very well be that I'm not even fully human, but the product of genetic mixing with an extraterrestrial race of giants with huge brains."
3,Not any better than other Peltor Hearing Protectors,"I bought these muffs for mainly one reason and that was comfort. I work in a noise environment and go shooting often. Sometimes I have muffs on for hours, and people who use them would know how uncomfortable they get after a short period of time. I have the Extreme performance Peltor muffs with a 30dB noise reduction which work great. If you are into shooting I would strongly recommend those compared to these which only have 24dB noise reduction. I bought these for my work since I did not need as much noise reduction but needed more comfort. On the product page it's stated that these have Liquid/Gel filled cushions. Although I have not tear the cushions open to see, by feel, they feel exactly the same as my regular Peltors and I do not believe they are gel or liquid filled. As far as comfort goes they are a little bit more comfortable than the extreme model, but not by much."
5,nice and comfy,"I have long hair was worried about not a good seal, but it worked fine even with a couple guys blasting their 45s. I could also hear the rangemaster without any issues. I wore these for 1 hr and total comfort. I use the plastic packaging it came with as the carrying case, so it doesn't get smashed in my range bag."
4,good product,the build quality is good...it does create a lot of pressure..but still it is itself comfortable...
5,ok great earmuffs but wtf is up with the name?,"only positive things to say about these, except the name. I almost feel retarded wearing something that says ""president"" on the side, one of these days I'm going to have to scratch that off of them."
5,"So far, so good",I gave these to my mother--she uses a hearing aid and needs to be careful. She was able to figure out how to use them and they seem comfortable enough.
2,"Don,t Bother","Not worth your money, time or effort. From a talent aspect, this may well be he the poorest effort at film making I have ever seen. It has absolutely nothing to offer."
1,Look Elsewhere,...and I would add to the above review: the startling omission of Taiwan and Taiwanese culture -- quite distinct from the Mainland Chinese.
2,Just not a good read,It was a struggle to read this book. I love thread but trying to get through this book was very hard. It didn't hold my attention at all.
5,Realistic and effective.,Thomas White really keeps the focus on effectively discerning evil in your life.
4,Thought provoking reading,"Very understandable in laymen terms and common sense. The author makes the reader think about the ""real"" warfare out there and how to protect yourself."
4,Dual Control - Left Or Right,"Some nice mellow instrumental hip-hop from Dual Control on their debut album, _Left or Right_. The sassy quotation on the title track gives an idea of the funk to follow, like the nice horn stabs and flanged samples on ""You Never"" or the mysterious dub-breaks on ""Global People"" and ""Burn It Out."" ""Sunrise"" brings a spiritual melancholy to the album, a real ear-opener. Not much that follows that track matches up, although the strings on ""Do You Remember?"" and ""Conscience"" start to approach it, especially as each track grows simpler and more effective after their midsections. ""Spring Again"" closes the album on some folksy-soul vocals and interesting percussion. Whatever direction you go, this album will surely please."
4,Majella is terrific!!!,It's good to see Majella O'Donnel stepping out and recording her own music. Well done!! I'm enjoying.
2,Standard Horror Film,"This is another typical horror movie with individualsbeing picked off one by one during the courseof the movie - there is a bit of a ""twist"" to the ending butnot too exciting a ""twist"".Level of gore - low blood contentLevel of sex - nothing. One relationship is underdeveloped.Level of suspense - lowCharacter development - low (moderate in case of protagonist)"
1,Only if you're really bored.,"I had high hopes for this game as I really enjoyed Fallout.This game is not Fallout. The look is similar and some of the weaponry is interesting, but any positive qualities are grossly overshadowed by the horrid dialogue. It seems like a non-english speaker has created scripts that they think Americans (or other english speakers) will think are ""cool"". It reminds me of the Kung-Fu movies that have been dubbed in english but with more profanity and less intelligence and cohesion.The quests were mindless and you can't interact with most of the characters. One quest involved leaving a building and retrieving an object that was placed right next to the door of the building you just left and bringing it back inside. That's it!The story line is very linear as well.I couldn't play it for more than an hour or so. You should only get this if you want to see an excellent example of a really bad game."
1,Disappointing,"Pros: Graphics were ok. The cutscenes are nice. Granted, it's not Myst.Cons: Ah... where do I begin? I was really disappointed with this game. I can only play for less than 5 minutes before the game would suddenly crash. It happened every time I play, whether I chose to do a new game or do the tutorial.Then there's the swearing. Lanthan curses and swears at *every* single sentence that he utters. And there's no option to turn them off, either.Finaly, the controls. The movements of the cursor were slow. It takes a bit of maneuvering just to get it to where you want to go.Overall, I could have lived with the swearing and the lousy controls. But the constant crashing is a pain. I don't know if it's just my laptop or the game itself. It's definitely not worth the money I paid for."
3,Only covers Fireworks,"The title says Dreamweaver and Fireworks, but it really only covers Fireworks. The Fireworks examples seem fine, but if you're still getting the hang of Dreamweaver, this book isn't as useful."
2,Title is Misleading,"If you are in the market for a comprehensive tutorial for Macromedia Dreamweaver, this is not the book for you. The first ten chapters are spent on learning Macromedia's image editing software, Fireworks. The title of the book is very misleading."
5,",,Here comes Santa Claus""","A lot of fine Christmas projects that I can use in my woodwork teaching. ,,Merry Christmas"""
3,Bought it for one song only,"I bought this CD for the song ""Too Beautiful to Last"". I also enjoyed the song ""She""."
4,good so far,"So far this book has been good, just got it not too long ago. Seems to be right on track with class material, good reference book. Easy to read."
3,average,"Its just ok, nothing special. Easy reading, but only purchased because was required for class I was taking. Learned some new things though."
2,an incomplete guide,"This book is written in a way that is easy to understand, but really does not go into much detail. The directions are sometimes incorrect and/or incomplete, e.g. the installation section does not explain how to create a boot disk nor does it direct you to the back cover where the directions are as well as a few path names being incorrect."
1,Not Good in a Nutshell,"Having an extensive programming background, I decided to learn Linux because my company is trying to move all their servers over from Windows machines. I got this book with the intention of learning some of the ins and outs of Linux. Well, this book is simply not good. It covers far too many topics without covering anything in depth. It gives some decent reference sources for more information, but it reads more like a Linux for Dummies book. For anyone who is able to do things as simple as set up their email, this book will frustrate you to no end in that it covers so much, it covers nothing. I don't know what is a good Linux book, but I don't think it is one that has you learn the system in 24 hours."
2,I didn't like the you remind me part,I have to agree with the other reviewer. This book was really about four lovers. And the fact that 2 of the lovers were the former husband and fiance of the other 2 lovers made it just two weird. Besides that the story just didn't flow. Next time Linda please stick to a great story line about 2 people.
2,2 Stories in One???,I enjoyed the last book by this author and I bought this one because I assumed I would enjoy this one also. However I was wrong!The story line about the main characters was the only thing that made me finish reading the book. I just flipped over the New York chapters and read all the Barbados chapters. That's the way I was able to complete the book. I agree with the other reviewers about the double stories. The minor characters were not essential to the main story. I have read books like this before but there is usually a certain flow or connection to the scenes other than being the fomer lovers of the main characters. I wished I could get a refund on this book!
4,A True-Blue 60's Girl Group Comedy!,"My Boyfriend's Back(not to be confused with the completely putrid 1993 movie)stars Sandy Duncan(the Wheat Thins Lady), Jill Eikenberry(L.A. Law) and Judith Light(Who's The Boss?)as a reunited 1960's girl group who are the main attraction for a TV special. I first seen this film on a local TV station here in Chicago and I loved it. I thought it would never be available on DVD. Of all the Made-For-TV Movies I have seen in my lifetime, this is definitely among my favorites."
5,awesome,the movie is great. especially since i love judith light! it is a great movie. i absolutely love it and judith light is great in this movie!
3,DMA Magazine Review,"Raspy male vocals and a distinctive guitar riff highlight this 12-inch release produced, arranged and mixed by Rick Pier O'Neil. Give it a listen."
4,The prince who loved Emma,"I like this book because it tells about a prince that loved Emma. He want to married her and take her to a castle, but she doesn't want to live in a big beautiful castle. She want to stay home and help her mom to clean the house.. I think the kids that would read this book they would like it."
5,Kat,"I love using this book with my math class. Every year I read it to my classes during the season, and then I make them find out how many gifts in all Emma actually receives. Great for math strategies."
4,The prince who loved Emma,"This is a good book, because it tells a beautiful story about a prince that loved Emma, but Emma doesn't want to live in a beautiful castle. This story is about love."
2,Elevator Music,"I must confess myself not to be much of a Michael Kamen fan, having in the past either tolerated his work (Don Juan DeMarco) or downright disliked it (Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves), but his score for X-Men is by far my favorite thing he has done , based on just one track: ""Logan and Rogue"". The relationship between Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Anna Paquin's Rogue is the brightest aspect of the film itself, and inspired Kamen to create a theme for them that is both hauntingly beautiful and achingly sad. Unfortunately, Kamen never reaches such heights again with his score (although ""Death Camp"" almost succeeds at creating a pensive mood) and ultimately I agree with one reviewer who called it ""white noise"", neither obtrusive nor memorable. His biggest failure is in the main theme, which is dull and vaguely annoying. The best-selling comic book heros deserve better; hopefully in the sequels they will get it, although probably not from Michael Kamen."
2,What a disappointment!,"Knowing Michael Kamen's work before, this was a great disappointment! There is no ""leif motiv"" throughout the soundtrack so you really don't get a feel for characters while you are listening to the music. Its more of 'elevator music', fillers for the film and can not stand on its own without the image of the film. Where in his other work, ""Robin Hood:Prince of Thieves"" the music stands on it's own and really is a beautiful score. I expected more of a beautiful piece for ""Logan & Rogue"" a more moving piece but it's just more 'elevator music' to me and it didn't move as it should knowing what those two characters have been through in the film. It also seemed rushed, maybe if Mr. Kamen had more time with the score it would had more of an impact."
1,Horrible!,The score just about ruined the movie. Totally wrong. Where's David Arnold or Elliot Goldenthal when you need them?
3,What? No Paul McCartney?!,"Michael Kamen's great and all, but I gotta wonder why that old Paul McCartney & Wings song ""Magneto & Titanium Man"" wasn't included on this soundtrack....not only is it by Macca himself, but it's pure cheese! It also has the memorable line: ""Magneto said the time has come/to gather our forces and RUN!"" Grab up a copy of Wings' ""Venus & Mars"" and you'll hear the song that shoulda been in the movie....."
2,This is not what I expected.,"Well this is the score of an awesome and very entertaining motion picture, but it is too classical and not appealing to the young fans who saw the movie."
4,A Pleasant Film Score,"Michael Kamen's ""X-Men"" score isn't necessarily a stand-out example of orchestration, but it thankfully escapes the many sci-fi film scores that simply repeat the same mediocre ambiance over and over. There are some truly good tracks mixed in with some pleasant tones, creating a fairly good soundtrack.The first and best track is, of course, ""Death Camp,"" where Kamen demonstrates excellent use of the dark and moody basses and subtle orchestrations. Other tracks that shine on this album included ""Mutant School"" as well as ""Rogue and Logan.""""X-Men"" was very much an introductory movie that layed the groundwork for its sequels, and Kamen's score was a faithful accompaniment to that goal. While it might not be one of the best soundtracks of the decade, it was certainly worth the price for any fan of the movie -- although the childish crediting on the front cover to ""Michael K-Men"" was a bit of a deterrent for me."
3,Adequate if uninspired score,"First I love Michael Kamen's work. I think his Robin Hood score is one of the best ever written and I enjoyed most of his work. This cd is no exception. I do enjoy it, but there are better scores out there, especially in the super-hero department. Some of Kamen's tracks are excellent. The Death Camp beginning is great as is his theme for Logan and Rogue. HIs theme for the X-Men, while not as bombastic as Ottman's theme for X2 is still a fine if extremely underused piece of work. HIs villain themes and other filler music were not the best however. Unfortunately they are featured on almost every track of the cd. Also lacking is an end credits track to showcase the entire score. Overall the score to X-Men is not bad and in places is quite good, but in others it's simply unfullfilling."
3,Good music...bland CD.,"I loved the music...IN the movie. It just blended well and flowed well with the action, story, and characters. Especially the rousing X-Fanfare. But...the CD seems dissapointing for some reason..lackluster somehow. And where the heck is the final chess match scene music between Xavier and Magneto where the X-Fanfare comes back and reaches a crescendo leading into the end credits (which are also missing). I dunno who's fault that is...but....CHEAP! C'mon. Soundtracks are turning into Pop music CDs, with less and less music and tracks. And when you hear something in the movie that you can't wait to hear at home, it's downright annoying if not insulting not to get it."
4,"Good score, but where are the heroic fanfares and stuff?","I was expecting a John Williams-like score, with metals and fanfares aplenty (perhaps inspired by the likes of Superman and Batman). I expected lots of leitmotif and heavy, heroic orchestration. This is not what I discovered when I listened to the CD. It was unexpected, but good. Very good. Really, really very good (especially every music related to the Magneto character: ""Death Camp"", ""Magneto's Leir"", ""Magneto stand off""). The orchestral and electronic music mix is actually very dynamic and capture the dark atmosphere surrounding the X-Men. I did not see the Motion Picture yet. But if the movie is as good as the soundtrack, I will be delighted."
3,X-Meandering,"I like Michael's work in general (and Michael himself, who makes a great interview subject), but this score seems almost to have been produced on automatic pilot -- whether this was due to time constraints, or because of writing for a small ensemble with sampler/synth support, I don't know. Thematically, a throwback to the fifties b-movies, the acoustic elements mesh poorly with the techno elements, weakening the whole (though not as badly as Event Horizon.)There are good points, however -- the delightfully pompous X-fanfare, the Wolverine theme, Rogue's theme, and Magneto's theme, which is reprised throughout on keening violin.It could -- should -- have been better."
4,A Guilty Pleasure,"I rarely (as in once in the last decade) go to movies and seldom listen to soundtracks; however, I can pass along a recommendation on this one as a guilty pleasure. Full of menacing low strings, gut-busting deep bass (yes, you'll need a good subwoofer to get the full effect), frantic percussion, and atmospheric samples, it's just a fun recording, much more enjoyable than any rock recording I have heard in a long time, and I must confess that to these ears it is more musically involving than anything I have heard by Arnold Bax, whose orchestral meanderings have been enjoying a revival lately on Naxos. No, this is not profound music, but it is imaginative, fun, effectively scored, and devilishly well recorded to boot."
5,X-Men loves K-Men,"Wow, great score. If theres one guy I wanted to do this besides Elfman, its Kamen. Beautiful, it is. Great techno grooves, and cool background music. Although, if youre looking for the X-Men tv show theme, its not here, sorry."
5,Review of the X-Men Score,This is by far Kamen's best work in quite a while. He works in some fast and heavy synthesizers (ala Con Air and Armageddon) along with his patented suspenseful orchestrations (ala Die Hard) for a nice variety of sounds. Probably his best all around work since Lethal Weapon 1.
3,Does not fulfill expectations,"I bought this score because I enjoyed the movie and particularly remembered certain moments that I really like the music. That is just about the same reaction I have to the score itself; remembering certain moments I really liked. X-Men is not a well compiled soundtrack. Although there are some great sections in the music, I was upset to find that I had to wait through several minutes of dull fill-in music in almost every track. X-men is missing a main title track (even though it might resemble ""Cerebro"") and an end title track. In fact, the end of the CD is quiet, anti-climatic, and doesn't really make me want to listen to it again. I give this score a 3 because there are a few fleeting sections that shine through the gloom of the bad arrangement."
4,Where is the main theme,"First off I loved this soundtrack. But there is definatly something missing, and I think it is due to the fact that FOX hurried the production of the movie so much. They may have hurried the production of the CD as well. It is missing a track for the ending credits, the opening compelation, and a main theme. This I think makes the CD lacking a little bit. The music is great, but it just doesn't have enough there."
1,Not reliable,"I purchased this about a year ago and, after very light use, the dial will not hold zero.Even moving the caliper very slowly to a fully closed position, the pointer will indicate anywhere from three to five-thousandths of an inch off from what was set at zero.I emailed Chicago Brands and they said that although it could be repaired, the repair would cost more than getting a new one.Seeing how this caliper became absolutely unreliable after light home use, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Precision measuring instruments have to be reliable. Otherwise it defeats the purpose of providing accurate measurements."
1,Don't buy this...,"I received this caliper on it's box and packaged as it says on the description, but as soon as I looked at it, I knew there was something wrong with it. The needle was pointing to about 5 o'clock not 12 o'clock like it's supposed to. Then I opened it and closed it, and it pointed to 2 o'clock... it never repeated.It looks like the needle was lose on the pin and just slides on it.I returned it and decided to buy a better one."
4,Functional,"I purchased this so that I could check the shim sizes on my motorcycles valves. It did just what it was suppose to. As with any instrument, don't drop it. Especially this one as there is a lot of plastic and would not only knock it out of spec but probably render it useless if dropped."
3,Solid Outline of a Fascinating Man,"The story of William Walker will be skipped over in most High School and even College antebellum history courses. That's unfortunate, as it's a story worth telling. This book at 149 pages presents a solid, very readable outline of Walker's life. However, I felt like I didn't always understand Walker's motivations for making a given decision. While these motivations may be lost with Walker's life, it would help if the author presented a bit more conjecture as to why Walker made some of the decisions he did. Still, if you're looking for a good detailed outline of his life, this is the place to start. How many Americans have become president of another nation? Mr. Walker is the only one that I am aware of."
2,Too many facts!,"If you are a Cliff Claven kind of personality and appreciate the ""everything you've ever wanted to know"" style, then this is the book for you. If, on the other hand, you are looking for useful information buy Valerie Ann Worwood's book on Aromatherapy."
5,Wonderful reference book,"The lay out of this book is beautifully done. It's a wonderful quick reference guide because of this. The photos make it very visually interesting, and it is very easy to find information on whichever topic is of most interest to you. I also appreciate the fact that for each recipe, she also provides a list of other essential oils that work well for that condition."
2,as bare as unfinished furniture,"The Village Voice review excerpt, straight from the back of the novel, reads: ""A noir archetype as bare as unfinished furniture. The plot...has been sanded down into a taut monofilament... The prose in Shella is boiled to the bone.""At first, after reading this novel (in about 3 hours), I thought ""Hell, anybody can get pretty reviews to paste on the back of their book,"" and then I read it again (the review, not the novel) and decided that ""as bare as unfinished furniture"" wasn't really much of a compliment, after all.As exciting as unfinished furniture. Vachss has no real depth."
4,"dark, stylish, fantastic and utterly human","Vachss is an amazing writer. He writes about things that most of us will never see, in fact, most of us pray that we will never see the types of things he writes about. He creates characters that are so unbelievingly flawed that we cling to every printed word and sigh in disbelief. If you are looking for something to keep you up at night or something to send a shock to your brainstem, then Vachhs' Shella is for you."
3,Not instantly happy with this product.,"I've used the product over 15 times, and some of the scratches still look the same! I am holding out hope that eventually they will go away, but so far I don't see much improvement."
2,"Too much overview, no real life examples","This book is just one of those books covering everything, and actually nothing in detail."
3,Great model but missing screw,"This model is fantastic, does not easily break or neither does it fall apart. This model can be used for different things. I would recommend this to others, it was smaller than I pictured but for the price take advantage of it. I returned mine due to missing screw.:("
3,decent for the price,"I bought this because the full size was too expensive. Overall it is fine but the spinal curves are not correct, and the ribs are crooked, too up and wide compared to the real ribcage. The size is great, I have it on my desk and can watch it every day. The tailbone and lumbar spine bother me the most because the curvature is not posturally correct. I teach Pilates Method of Contrology and I really like having the skeleton to see every day. Wish that there was a skeleton with movable scapulae and better hip joint articulation that was affordable.... so I would recommend this with caution to the details. You need an anatomy book and prior understanding to correct the imperfections in your mind."
3,Satisfied- not great quality,I bought this skeleton to practice positioning for my radiography courses and to review anatomy. It will be fine for positioning even thought the lower leg falls off occasionally its easy to put back on the little pin just keeps sliding out. As far as using it for anatomy it will be OK not great just because you cant see as much detail as i would have liked. The 12th ribs on him look really funky but i guess i got what i paid for. overall i was satisfied enough to keep him.
3,"Good skeleton, fair customer service.","The skeleton worked out very well for my needs as a massage therapy student. However, I am less happy with this company's customer service. Originally, the wrong item was mailed to me. I could not get ahold of a live person when I called, so finally I emailed them. I did not get a reply, but they replaced the item quickly, for which I was grateful.This time, it arrived with a hole in the box where half of the metal stand had fallen out in the mail, presumably. I tried calling and emailing this company and never got a repsonse. It's no big deal, but I will have to make my own stand if I ever want one, and it's a little annoying. I cannot recommend them. I should have bought it at my school bookstore- it would have been worth the extra money to avoid this hassle."
1,Bad product,"Tried to play this on five DVD players, not one would play it. It's made for players only but I put it in players, DVD-Roms, portable DVD, Blu-Ray, nothing worked. Beware this is a poorly made product."
2,Ho-hum,"I read the book ""Haywire"" by Brooke Hayward. This miniseries is a huge disappointment because even with the talent of Lee Remick and Jason Robards as Margaret Sullavan and Leland Hayward, the production values are very bad. There's no explanation about why Ms. Sullavan took her own life or why she and Mr. Hayward divorced---I wish the writers would have given more background about the family and developed the characters more thoroughly."
2,I'LL HAVE TO AGREE,"The homie Jim is correct with thi film, what more can i say then this was very dissapointing.The fact that it made out to be like it stars kurupt, it goes the opposite way and only features the rapper in a few scenes. When I first got this I was very excited to chill with my boys and view it, but that went down the drian. Don't get me wrong it has it's moments and if you are a die hard kurupt fan like my self you will no doubt buy it. But I woundn't recommend it to many people."
1,Keepin' It Real REVIEW,"It very rarely gets any worse than this lousy low-budget straight-to-video urban comedy featuring Dogg Pound Gangsta, Kurupt, in his first ""starring"" role. Fact is Kurupt is only shown in about three or four sequences and the rest of the film is about a studio executive's daughter who steals her rapper boyfriend's master recordings and heads out to California to find him. Along the way, she meets up with a nerdy but romantic wannabe poet. Even Tiny Lister, who is usually always pretty good in his roles, can't save this garbage."
1,the fine print not included,"You might assume that a battery tester would test the power remaining in a battery, but this is more literally a battery tester-- if you have a roll of film and insert it in the battery tester, the light will not come on, indicating that it is not a battery-- unless your battery is REALLY REALY dead (like it just came out of your 8 track tape player), it will have enough power to illuminate the little light. If you are really good, you can see a slight difference in the brightness of the light between a battery that is too dead to use in something and a fully charged battery.You get what you pay for-- to properly test a battery, it needs to put some kind of a load on it while testing it.But if you have trouble distinguishing a roll of film from a battery, this puppy is for you!"
4,Lenmar Battery Tester with Key Ring for AA & AAA Batteries.,The Lenmar Battery Tester with Key Ring for AA & AAA Batteries does the job that I was looking for. It indicates that the battery is alive or not. Thanks!
5,"Mactatus ""Provenance of Cruelty"" CD","Thanks, I have received MACTATUS ""Provenance of Cruelty"" CD,It's very impressive, dark and melodic music, really Black Metal.I am glad to have such CD in my music collection.best regardsIvan Akimov, Moscow, Russia"
3,good release but a wrong time and a wrong band,"ok, here we go with Another Norwegian melodic black metal. whoopie! is it any good? It's true those guys can handle instruments with skill and conviction but the vocals sound a bit weak and just like Emperor's Ihsahn type ones. Honestly, I thought that he sang on this album. And what's the point of sounding like Emperor? This seems like a missing album between ""In the nightside eclipse"" and ""Anthems"" ! It's quite annoying as this is Norse band as well. Everything they do on this disc, has been done before. This album just arrived too late in the bm scene. I just hope that this band doesn't end up as a ""poster"" band like their countrymen!"
5,I Love This CD,"Wanted this CD because ever since I heard, "" How Do I Live "", I have fallen in love with it !! My fiancee and I , like it so much we have decided , to use it as our wedding song, which will be in May 2013 !! Thank You So Very Much for this CD !! I am definitely one satisfied customer !! Thank You Again !!"
5,Book of Songs,"Songbook is the first chapter of Yearwood's career, of her biggest hits. This album features nine of her biggest hits, plus three excellent new songs. While not all of her hits are on here, with a few missing, it covers some of her biggest from She's In Love With the Boy to Thinkin About You, and everything in between. The most notable songs missing are the hits Believe Me Baby (I Lied) and Everybody Knows, among a few. The new songs, are something to talk about. How Do I Live was one of the biggest songs of the summer in 1997, and I don't care what anyone says, Trisha can outsing LeAnn Rimes on this one. LeAnn is missing the true emotion in the song, that Trisha has excellently displayed. In Another's Eyes is a duet ballad with Garth Brooks, their strongest duet ever. And Perfect Love is a fun upbeat song which proved to be a hit for Trisha. Overall this is a nice collection of Trisha's hits, a nice cd to start your collection with if you are a new fan."
5,This can be played over and over!,"I have had this CD in my car for about two months and I am not bored with it yet. I am normally not a country fan, however Trisha Yearwood transcends labels. She is a great singer and the cuts on this album are really a great collection starting with the theme from ConAir, ""How Do I Live"" to her duet with Garth - ""In Another's Eyes"". ""The Song Remembers When"" is one you'll want to hear if you haven't and you'll tap your foot to ""The Wrong Side of Memphis"". Actually, every song on this album is a winner! I am looking forward to getting Trisha's next album!"
5,Take a lesson Leann!,"This entire CD is perfection. Trisha's version of ""How do I Live"" is by far the standout and a much better rendition than Leann Rimes version, who might as well be singing the song to her teddy bear. I've been a huge fan of Trisha for a long time. Its too bad alot of people miss out on her incredible voice because she's labeled as ""country."""
5,"Stellar ""Collection""","After amassing a ton of hits over the years, SONGBOOK seemed a long time coming when it arrived in 1997. With this fine collection, Yearwood staked her claim as arguably the finest interpretive singer to emerge in mainstream country in the last decade. Though her first few singles, starting with ""She's In Love With The Boy"", firmly established her as one to watch, songs like ""The Woman Before Me"" and ""The Song Remembers When"" showed off her technically perfect vocal work. Also a plus was the inclusion of ""Down On My Knees"", only a moderate hit but one that remains her finest moment in a thus far stellar career."
5,Think You Hate Country? Try 'Songbook' On For Size,"With all due respect to the country crossover acts lately, it's a crime that Trisha Yearwood is not hoisted to the same multi-platinum, heavy-rotation status as, say, Shania, Faith, LeAnne and The Dixie Chicks. This woman is The Real Thing.To say her voice is powerful doesn't do her justice. Other singers have powerful voices, but use these gifts to butcher songs. Ms. Yearwood executes each song perfectly. With each song comes the emotional depth of an entire novel, the maturity of every woman, the narrative turned into a personal experience.There is not one clunker in this bunch. A dozen songs that flow together harmoniuosly; some fun, some sad, all gripping in their own way. You do not have to like country music to love this album. I wish it sold twenty million records. I guarantee your standard for what qualifies as good music will be raised. Just buy it."
4,"Not bad, but not the best level","I got this on sale for less than $20 (!) and for that price, it's a steal. Had I paid closer to $50, I would be a little disappointed b/c the fit and finish of this level leaves a little to be desired. That said, it is sturdy and true, and seems like it will last a long time. I'd have given it 3.5 stars if that were an option."
1,P.O.S.,I recently purchased 2 of these levels from lowes for around $70 bucks a piece. About 2 weeks later one of them started giving false readings. Luckly I realized it before making any crucial errors and exchanged it for another. Believe it or not..the replacement was bad too! I use 6 foot levels for extreme accuracy but you cant do it with a swanson. take my advice and buy a Johnson...
3,Refurbished 450 Garmin,"I purchased this product with the understanding that it was refurbished, but was as good as new. Well , the maps on it were out of date, never brought up to date when refurbished, so I then had to purchase updated maps which cost over $100.00 . So I you add cost of 450 Garmin plus cost of maps, I could have purchased NEW 550 Garmin same price."
4,Good Basic Motorcycle GPS,I have used my Zumo 450 in both the USA and Europe. It is easy to program and the database is fairly good in both locations. The unit is also rugged and waterproof and the mounting hardware is very solid.The negatives are the feature-set is limited compared to the less expensive car GPS units. The battery life is not very good - a couple of hours at best on my motorcycle trip in Europe. I have also had one instance of the unit just locking up which is almost impossible to recover from with removing the battery - a major pain in the butt.Would I but it again - yes - if the price was right versus other waterproof offerings.
2,Great but doesn't stand the test of time. Buy cheaper model and replace as needed.,"Simply put. This works great. It locks a signal fast, routes well, bluetooth compatibility is good.Problem = long-term. You're paying $600 for a device that, after a year, is out of warranty.If you're a casual ""biker,"" go for it. If you're a daily rider or hardcore enthusiast, get the extended warranty or buy a cheaper GPS and swap it out.For $600, you can buy six GPS and just chuck 'em when they become problematic.I regret purchasing a Zumo."
4,Motorcycle GPS,"Very pleased with this item. Does exactly as it describes and is all in one. Perfect for motorcycles. Some initial issues with the software freezing, but latest updates seems to have fixed that."
2,Garmin Zumo 450 - shipped not as advertised,"Caution..., Product price is good and advertised as new, but I received a previously used Zumo missing a part. When I contacted Customer Service however, they were very cooperative and immediately shipped what appears to be a new, not previously used Zumo. Very suprised with Amazon. Thought it would be better experience as this was my first order with them. Bottomline: I should not have had to go through that hassle."
4,Zumo 450 does the job,"I have been pleased with the performance of the Zumo 450. It's cheaper than the 550 model. I don't need bluetooth. The only annoyance is that some of the points of interest, and even road changes are out of date by perhaps a couple of years."
4,Zumo 450 Best GPS I have Owned,"The Zuno 450 is well thought out. The human interface is the best I have used but not quite all there. I found some of the access a bit confusing. Obtaining the current latitude and logititude was not quite as easy as I would thought of. Also playing with the log (bread crums) was a bit hard to get through the first time.Some wishes for the Zumo. Since the Honda VFR is famous for unreliable regulator rectifiers, I would like a way to display the voltage. I would like the audio volume to be raised or lowered as a function of the speed; motorcycles do tend to get noisy, being out there in the air.Mounting on my Y2K Honda VFR was simple (thanks to ram mount).Overall, I am pleased with the Zumo. The display is good, still a bit hard to read in direct sunlight. Controls are easy to get to. Even the touch screen with a gloved hand."
2,less than good,How could you sell a GPS WITHOUT Bluetooth?I thought it would function as well if not better than my car's GPS and this one cost 3 times more.I will have to hard wire it to a headset and not be able to use my phone while riding.
5,good product,"Very nice product has most roads, could have altimiter & other options but works very well"
4,Great GPS for Motorcyclists,"Ordered my GPS from Amazon when the price was $399. Ordered arrived quickly, everything looked new in sealed factory packaging. Installation of the unit on the RAM mount was easy, but you need to know how to hardwire the GPS unit to your battery for power, there are no instructions for this. The unit works great and is easy to use. My only problem is that I can't get the Map Source Routes I have created with the software to download to my GPS unit....I keep getting an error code. Once I figure this out, I will be 100% satisfied."
3,surprise,"The Watch Itself was as advertised. but the band was deceiving. It was to small for my wrist, it cut off my circulation when I put it on the first day and has to be replaced. After I brought the date up to present day the watch has performedwithout any trouble at all. It has kept time exactly. So if you buy this watch beware you may have to replace the band as soon as you get it. Expansion band??? HA! They should ask a wrist size when ordering."
1,Timex did not work,I am a long time Timex watch user but this watch simply did not work. I took it to a jeweler for repair and he said it was simply wound too tight and he could not fix it. The watch arrived in this condition and never ran. Good looking watch but only had correct time twice a day.
3,Looks Great,"i bought this watch for myself, i being a female, and its very nice looking. Great colors, and all, unfortunatly to me, it seems a bit small for being a Man's watch. i bought a Mans watch because i have a rather large wrist for a female, about 8 1/2 inches, though this is an expandable watch, it was a bit tight. Too tight for myself to be comfortable with. So if you're buying this for a Man, or woman, keep in mind if they have a larger wrist, this may be a bit snug fitting for them.Other than that, its a great watch. It is very nice looking and working for a great price!!"
5,nice,"Very nice looking watch with no problems .I wear it to work and the benzel has no scratches ,even thou i don't baby it timex makes sense in priced good and takes a lickin and keeps on tickin... :)"
4,super sexy!,"This is a cute outfit, super sexy. Hugs u in all the right places. Really short though, make to wear something underneath so your underwear won't show, unless it's for your man!"
4,nice,"Got this for me and my bf, he loves the feel of it, though it's a bit short..but that's the point! Only complaint is that it can be a little delicate."
3,VERY NICE!,"VERY FITTED, YOU WILL NEED SOME POWDER ON SO IT DOESN'T STICK AT CRUCIAL MOMENTS. IT WILL DRIVE YOUR GUY CRAZY!!"
3,Dividing Information... A new chapter in LP books!,"I travel a lot, and have found Lonely Planet guides to be a big help... I still do... granted, some of the info is inaccurate (particularly with prices), but every guidebook provides a caveat at its beginning to warn readers of unstable prices... generally the inaccuracies never amount to more a pitance.I found the LP Spain book to be more useful than the Let's Go! Spain guidebook as the LP book had more background information, more listings for places to stay and more maps with better detail... unfortunately, as one of the other reviewers mentioned, this book and many of their other guide books are starting to refer you to other LP mini guides... they used to throw everything you needed between those covers, but these days you almost have to carry a small library around with you to get what a early 90s LP book would give you. Still better than Let's Go!, but for how long?..."
3,Par for the course...,"Yeah, this book is a lot better than nothing, or even some of their lackluster competitors in the guidebook industry. LP's maps and format are better than the others. However... some of the other reviewers were right on in the complaints dept. This book gives too little of the essential info you buy a guide for; i.e. transport options and hotel details. Given that the writer supposedly lives in Spain, some of the sketchiness concerning hotels and restaurants is inexcusable. The prices are also way off; apparently, nobody bothered to revisit the museums and hotels to check up on things. The Latin American guides do a much better job describing places a lot harder to cover than Spain or most of the other only tolerable European guides, for that matter. I don't think I stayed in more than a couple of the recommended hotels for the whole two months I spent in Europe using numerous LP guides. Luckily for LP, their competition is even worse."
4,Sabina usted que...,"Como cantante y compositor J. Sabina a dejado claro que está a la altura de los mejores en su profesión. Con una lírica similar a la de cantantes de la talla de J.M. Serrat, su estilo particular y forma de ver la vida (realista, cruda y coloquial) hace que algunas de sus letras resulten ofensivas para algo oidos delicados... hay que saber entenderlo y hay que saber que se está eschuchando."
4,A treasure in an unexpected place.,"This short children's story is about an elderly man who is told in a dream to travel a long distance to a city to find a treasure. He finds it in an unexpected place; not where he expected. A book that children will enjoy for a long time. The book was a 1980 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustrations in a book for children."
5,A Teasure,This is another of the titles I chose to add to my personal collection after retiring as a children's librarian. It is a simple tale with a deep message which is accessible at different levels to all ages. The beautiful color illustrations are equal to the text and are the reason this book won a Caldecott Honor Award. This was one of my sons' favorite book when he was younger.
4,"Not bad, exactly","I really like the illustrations in this book. They are neither too simple nor too complex.And I like the style of this book, a direct, straight-forward storytelling.I'm not sure I like the story itself, though I can't put my finger on *why*, exactly. It isn't all that compelling to me or my nieces (5 and 2.5), anyway.I'm giving it four stars because there are parts of it I *really* do enjoy, as I said, but... read it before you buy."
5,"Simply Satisfying, leaves you with a pleasant yearning...","My two children, probably a little young for this one, enjoy it from the intriguing title, the dream, then the journey to find...how and where, and what will Isaac find? The moral is...lovely, heartwarming. Doesn't everyone want to find their treasure? Love this one."
1,Disappointing,"I bought this book for my children hoping to ennoble their hearts with the wisdom that one may have to travel far to value what he already has near. The book started out ok but I found the ending terribly disappointing, as if a literal treasure is the cure-all for one's poverty and troubles. I had to read this book a least a dozen times to see if I was missing something. I just can't figure out why anyone would like it. Please enlighten me."
3,The series had potential. -Jult Warfell,"Well I watched this and I was entertained, yet it had more to offer if they had the budget. -Jult Warfell"
2,Poor Phone. Horrible Batt. Life,"Was very excited to get this phone and quickly disappointed. The battery life on this phone, even the extended battery is horrible. This phone spent more time on the charger then on my belt. Cannot download ringtones, wall papers, etc. Very limited on what features it had. Not user friendly at all. Thankfully verizon offered me an early out.Would not recommend this phone. Pay extra and get a Blackberry."
2,This phone is really slow and poorly thought out.,"This phone is a poor replacement for my Blackberry. It's very slow, it's very buggy (including multiple random crashes for no reason), and the operating system seems like an early draft. There are few features with make the phone easy to use. You can't even change the font for reading email. I really wish I could send it back and get another Blackberry.I bought it because I thought Windows mobile would be ""seamless"" with my desktop. It's okay, but it's no better than a Blackberry. In fact, consumers should beware that Windows Mobile Smart Phone is not Windows Mobile - it doesn't include Word or any of the other applications which I thought it would include when I bought it.This was the first Motorola since I quit them ""for good"" a year ago. I think I'm going to buy iPhones for the next 10 years."
2,Bad Battery Life / Terrible Sync,The Q looks like it might be a Blackberry replacement. It's not:-It is more difficult to type on the Q-The battery life (please see other reviews which will really go into depth on this) is terrible-Sometimes the syncing software (I am pretty good with computers) works and sometimes it doesn't. This may be a Vista issue as I am running Vista.
3,Burn in,"This is a great TV, but I permenately burned the screen when I accidently fell asleep with my PC on. Luckly I was able to return it to the brick and mortar store where I bought it and they didn't spot it. I loved this unit, but am a bit hesitant now that I have learned how easy it is to burn an image into plasmas. It took less then 12 hours to kill it."
1,Samsung lies with 10000:1 ratio!,Don't get me wrong. The TV is nice and all. BUT the advertised 10000:1 ratio is more like 3000 or 4000:1 ratio of Panasonic. The quality is about the same as Panansonic or Pioneer. Don't pay extra $$$ for 10000:1 ratio crap!
5,upbeat dance praise and worship,"This cd has tons of fun songs, that you can totally dance to, but you know that you're not just dancing for yourself, your dancing for your Jesus! It has an eclectic mix of songs to enjoy!"
4,chosen One,"hi, well I'm from Australia and have had the oportunity to hear the Youth Alive Band play Live, I must confess I love this band, but I do believe that this audio cd is excellent the songs are well written and produced.I think they deserve recognition for the work that they have put in and I recommend this cd to anyone seeking music to inspire them to worship the lord."
5,Very handy!,I recommend this bag for carrying a Hercules guitar stand.Taking a good stand to practice or gigs is a smart idea. Bag is well made. Great strap for carrying.Love it.
5,"Nicely made, nice value for the money..","just like the herc 415 stand I just purchased, this carry bag is well made, fits the stand great and is one of those items that you say, ""I wonder how they can sell it for a great price""..real happy I bought it.."
2,just my opinion,"Edge of Sanity may be very talented musicans, Dan Swanö might be a great producer and songwriter, but I think this Cd lacks one thing. Feeling. There aren't any really agressive or melancholical moments on the whole album, in my opinion of course. They seem to try anything, Gothic/Romantic (Twillight), Black Metal (Of darksome Oregin), Entombed ( Song of Sirens)... but I don't get the impression that they really put any emotions in it. The whole Cd sounds so static and predictable, the lyrics are as poetic as the daily news about the stock market exchange and Dan Swanö's Voice sounds tiring, boring and overproduced. I didn't get to hear any other EOS album exept ""Crimson"" which is just one 40 minute song, so I can't talk about their musical evolution or what has become of them. It's just my opinion, be happy with this CD if you want to."
2,"Cut well, until handle broke","I purchased the Union Tools 62430 bypass lopper in December, 1999 and used it for the first (and only) time in January, 2000.While the tool cut extremely well for a couple hours, the handle bent when I attempted to prune an osage orange (hedgeapple) tree. Unfortunately, the handle is not replaceable."
3,I love the second amendment and all guns,This was just a little bit slow... I like these types of things too so for me to say that it was a little slow means it was not that good. still a lot of good information though.
4,Great Album,"Mushroomhead's second local release from 1996, originally available only at shows and at CD stores in their local hometown of Cleveland, Ohio. Now available to you no matter where you live. Contains songs such as Bwomp, These Filthy Hands, Chancre Sore, and Never Let It Go, which were all remixed for their first national release ""XX"".Tracklisting:1. Bwomp2. Never Let It Go3. These Filthy Hands4. The Wrist5. Chancre Sore6. Flattened7. Big Brother8. Idle Worship9. Fear Held Dear10. Unintended11. Bwompbut you can get it cheaper on Mushroomheads official store for alot less it is outrageous to jack up prices on a cd cds should never go over $20[...]that is their official website plus amazon isnt selling thier M3 cd or their REMIX cd and people..there is a 6th album coming out this year so be on the lookout!!!"
4,the best mushroomhead album by far,"This is in my opinion as good as Mushroomhead ever sounded. This was a much different band than the one we see today, Sounds alot like Angel Dust era Faith No More, but with a creepy industrial feel. I dont know if its worth paying 40.00 dollars for, but this is a great album with an interesting atmosphere."
5,Great pre XX album,"Great album I picked up at one of their shows. You can pic these rare albums up at the bands website. Great album, awesome riffs and some extreme costumes."
4,Hank Jr. The Best Their Is,"This is one of my favorite Hank Jr. CDs. He Has songs on this cd that you can drink a beer to and also songs that will make you boogie. One of my favorite songs is ""Attitude Adjustment"" so many people today need them."
1,Romance de otra epoca,"Charlie Zaa & Los Panchos should be ashamed of selling this CD. This CD is nothing more than a repeat of previously released songs. Any fan of Charlie Zaa would have at least of five of the songs on this CD. Unfortunately I opened the CD so I can't return it. My only consolation is that this is the last CD I but from Charlie Zaa.... Apparently he can't come up with new songs so he just keep releasing the same ""old"" songs."
5,Studies in Gnosticism and Alexandrian Christianity,"The study of Gnosticism is now quite impossible without a thorough knowledge of the Nag Hammadi writings and, consequently, of the Coptic language. It is, however, the author's firm conviction that these often extremely difficult texts, as well as Gnosticism in general, can only be understood within the broader religious and philosophical context of the Graeco-Roman world, and that, within that context, Judaism and Christianity should not be isolated, as if they were opposed to the rest of the religious traditions of the ancient world, but must be considered integral parts of it. It is from this point of view that the studies in this collection have been written.Other titles by R. van den Broek include:Gnosis and Hermeticism from Antiquity to Modern Times (Suny Series in Western Esoteric Traditions), andFrom Poimandres to Jacob Bohme: Hermetism, Gnosis and the Christian Tradition. Recommended for libraries devoted to Gnostic studies."
2,A Grace Disguised,"We are thrilled with the content, as such, of this book, but purchased it for a study group. The description did NOT say that this purchased book had no preface, NOR A SET OF STUDY QUESTIONS?? as indicated on the book notes."
5,Spiritual food and allowance to grieve,"Losing my 25 year old son in a snowmobile accident 2 yrs ago I'm always on the lookout for support-laden information and empathy..I'm not the only one! This book was so well written and I traveled every emotion with Mr.Sittser..I absorbed every word,enveloping myself in the experience's cacoon,feeling every pain and grasping every word first knowledge..I would recommend this book for anyone that has had a devastating loss..(and who in the human race hasen't?)"
4,A Grace Disguised,"As a mother who lost a child in an accident, this book confirmed that I was not going crazy That some of the emotions I was going through are the same that Mr. Sittser experienced. I would recommend this book to anyone who has lost a loved one."
5,Stellar!,"The title track (Oh What a Night, 1968 version) has it's special place on my list of all-time favorite songs, but my only copy was on vinyl. Looking to update that one track, I selected this CD on chance, and I couldn't be more pleased! It's proved to be a stellar collection of old favorites along with happy re-discoveries and new finds, all served up with a great sound quality that's often elusive on older tracks. This showcase of ballads never falls short in it's display of the brilliant spot-on harmony and lush vocals of The Dells."
5,"The Dells,Oh What a night!!",Great early R&B CD. Brought back a lot of memories of my youth. A must for your collection!!!
3,VHS?,I found this on DVD only after I ordered the tape. Fantastic footage on DVD. Highly recommend getting the disc.
5,Beautiful & Involved,"One cannot properly learn about someone from the past without taking their surroundings into account. People often don't consider the broad spectrum of things that, trivial as they may seem, greatly influence one's behavior and needs. Erickson does a brilliant job of painting the backdrop for this misunderstood and abused Queen. Taken in her context, the vile myth of Bloody Mary is shattered to reveal the woman underneath. Emotionally engaging, highly descriptive, and wonderfully written, this book provides a wealth of knowledge in a format wholly enjoyable to read."
3,"Great character studies of Mary and her father, but biased","This is an engrossing character study of Mary Tudor, her mother and father, Katherine of Aragon and Henry VIII, and even her brother Edward VI. Detailed descriptions of costumes, ceremonials and official pageantry abound. Very interesting detail on Philip II and Spanish designs on the throne of England. Nearly half the book is given over to the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI. Little is said of Elizabeth. The Reformation and counter-Reformation in England are seen largely through the eyes of Mary - a decidedly sympathetic perspective on the harsh measures taken to reestablish Catholicism in fervently Protestant England. Reads like a novel, which is meant both as praise and caution. Before reading this colorful historical biography, read G. R. Elton's excellent ENGLAND UNDER THE TUDORS (despite the poor quality of the paperback edition) to understand the political and social context of the period."
2,Cover Portrait,"One wonders how factual a book will be when the author puts a portrait of Elisabeth of Valois, third queen of Philip II of Spain [Queen Mary's husband], on the front! After taking a picture to share the serious goof up I put it back on the shelf!!"
3,where is Elizabeth?,For the most part I enjoyed this book very much although it is quitelong. But there is much that I learned about tha Tudors and Mary in parti-cular. The only problem I had was that Elizabeth was completely ignoredduring the last section of the book when Mary becomes Queen. Some of the most dramatic events in her life occurred between herand Elizabeth just before her death. Also I beleive that Philip had alot of input with regard to Elizabeth. None of this is brought out in thisbook. Otherwise I enjoyed it and am glad that an in depth biography isnow available of this lamentable woman
3,Boody Mary,"After years of failed pregnancies and infant deaths, a daughter was born to Henry III and Katherine of England.She was the first female child in England's history to be given the throne as a birthright.But it would be a life of strife and emotional turmoil for Mary Tudor. After being declared a bastard for the sake of her father's notorious romances and being prosecuted for her religion, Mary gradually makes her way past all the hardships only to face a new set of challenges.I thought this book was smart, albeit rather dull. I would reccommend this book only to readers who find this subject interesting and who have a large vocabulary. This book won't pull you in, you have to walk. In comparision to other books, this book is really quite eloquent and shows the intensity of Mary's struggle to keep her principles, yet to remain loyal to her father."
5,Made in the USA!,"I recently started purchasing Fiesta dishes because they are made in the USA. Other companies are manufacturing their dishes in China, so I was pleased to find that Fiesta is made in the USA. I have purchased dish sets (Fiesta) for myself and both of my daughters, the array of colors go with any decor."
1,dishes were broken,dishes were broken. there is no one to contact. Im not shipping back broken dishes
2,A Translucent Account of a Simple History,"Economic history is studied based on concepts such as Merchantilism, Physiocracy, Classism, Marxism, Keynesianism, and so on. There are important people involved in this conceptual framework, such as Petty, Quesney, Smith, Marx, Keynes, and so on. Rima manages to take this simple history and create something far more complicated than necessary, and at times, incoherently pedantic. For example, Rima tries to explain derivation of a demand curve AND Hick's optimum conditions in 13 pages. Get real! Rather than issue a prolegomenon (Rima's word, page 202), I will make a suggestion: if this book is required reading for a college course, throw it away, and purchase Stanley L. Brue's excellent, coherent, and well-edited book, 'The Evolution of Economic Thought' (sixth edition). Brue's book is pricey, but you will actually learn something useful and interesting, and you might get from Quesnay to Keynes in 10 weeks without killing yourself!"
1,Needs more instruction,"You turn on the game and think you just hit the moles that pop out and you make it pass the first round.... If you don't have the instruction book, then don't think you are going to make it much farther. Boring, not worth the money...glad I rented it."
3,21st Century style Whac a mole,This game was not as much fun as I had hoped. It is a little difficult to properly catch a mole as the tap on the screen is sometimes not detected.(my DS is brand new and works properly) It is also a little hard due to the small viewing area. I let my friend's daughter (age 9) play it and she had fun but scored very low.
5,My favorite movie,"I would give this movie a MILLION stars if i could. This is my favorite movie. All the actors are amazingly talented, and the story line is incredible. I cried, laughed, smiled, all the emotions happened here. I would classify it as a psychological thriller/romance/a touch of comedy. This movie is a MASTER PIECE, and cannot be beat."
5,Purely awesome!!!,"If you're a DLM fan, than you know he writes and sings all his own music. He writes each song with such detail, it takes you away. Velvet Lies is so seductive. A great CD to keep you in an up mood."
4,good solid album,"This is a very solid effort from David Lee Murphy. The song ""She's not Mine"" is a wonderful bluesy rock/country song with an awesome guitar solo at the end. This is the best song he has ever written. The cd is worth buying for this song alone."
5,David Lee Murphy's best CD yet!,This CD is the best performance from David Lee Murphy yet. The songs have more feeling than before and really have that little extra that makes this a great CD. I would definately recommend this one to any country music fan!!!
2,Disappointed,"I was so excited to get my new shower bar. At first sight it appeared to be exactly what I ordered, but as I checked out all the parts I was disappointed. I ordered this shower bar because it came in the StarLight chrome, which matches all the other components in our new shower. There are 3 end caps included with the bar and even though the bar is chrome the included end caps are brushed nickel. Not the look I was going for. I will be returning the shower bar, and I was going to order another one, but after some thought decided to buy one locally. I really need to get this project completed and I can't afford any more delays. I arrived at my 2 star rating by taking off 1 star for each part that came in the wrong finish."
5,Short or Tall for your shower stall,"We installed a nice tall shower head for my husband in our retirement home. And then the grandson came along, we installed these right away and it's a fit for all. Perfect for shower bench height as well."
3,What?,"What is this CD? It does not even give a description of what the heck this CD actually is. Is it a new song, or what?"
5,my one-year old kitten took a bath in this bag,He only made a little noise. He looked frightened but ok. I trimmed his nails first then washed him in the bag just by myself easily. Mine grow a little fat and I guess he won't fit in medium size half year later.This is not the product I reviewed~ a mistake!
4,Literacy for the Workplace,Great book to use for English language learners that have been in the country for many years but lack the literacy skills needed for a business environment. The letter samples give great ideas for phrases and tone. The section on usage is an excellent overview to clear up any questions on grammar. I have recommended this book for my students at BusinesSpeak to keep on their desks as a reference guide.
4,"Chp 19. Culture and Customs, Work","As an American citizen, I take strong exception to Ms. Geffner's statement which follows and apparently is meant to be interpreted as representative of the opinions of all Americans. Also, what is her authority for making the enclosed statement:P.279 ""Therefore, whether the idle rich or the welfare poor, the ill or the retired, those who do not work are considered of no use to society."""
4,It's time for CBS to repackage and re-release this...,"It's hard to find a more lush, more comparable voice than Art Garfunkel's. All true Garfunkel fans own this CD and love giving it a spin. But when we get to his version of Tim Moore's Second Avenue, we all take a deep sigh. We simply cannot understand why someone decided to edit the original single version of this heart-wrenching, achingly beautiful ballad. We're pleading with you CBS. Find the original full-length master of this classic and release it to us. I know it's just one song, but perhaps you could just repackage ""Garfunkel"" or include it as a bonus cut on one of his solo albums. Garfunkel is synonomous with lush sound and our old vinyl 45 of this no longer does this incredibly hypnotic masterpiece justice. I'm sure I'm speaking for many Art fans. Our hopes continue...we hope someone is listening!"
5,A Great Best of Collection,"I noticed that the other best of collections were missing 2 great tracks contained here in this collection - ""All I Know"" and ""Second Avenue"" so although this collection has several less songs than the other greatest hits collections, in my opimion, this is the one to own. Plus you get the fine remake of the Tymes hit ""So much in Love"" also missing from the other collections."
4,"Not exactly the best Art's done, but it's still pretty good.","I have to be honest. When I first listened to this CD, I was a bit disappointed, because some of the songs didn't seem like they went with Art's personality. ""All I Know"" is beautiful. So is ""I Only Have Eyes for You"" (But I like Phil Baron's (Teddy Ruxpin's) version better.) Other songs I like are ""Bright Eyes"", ""A Heart in New York"", ""99 Miles"", and ""When A Man Loves A Woman"". The others I listen to but I'm not entirely fond of them. It's a good CD for the songs that I mentioned earlier, but this isn't my favorite."
4,Iconic voice,"One of the most important voices in pop music in the 1960s and 1970s was Art Garfunkel. Simon may have written the material, but it was quite often Art's voice that made it soar. I bought this CD because I heard Art's version of ""Second Avenue"" recently on the radio. I really didn't remember it from 1974 when it was a single (it was only a minor hit), but he sings it right and combined with ""I Only Have Eyes For You"" and ""All I Know"" this CD reminds the listener just how great Garfunkel's voice was."
5,1970's classic,"Art Garfunkel has a far better voice than Paul Simon, and I actually prefer Garfunkel's solo work to Simon's.This album showcases the best of Garfunkel's folkesque light rock, with some real gems.My favourites include the laidback Breakaway (1975), the beautiful and haunting Bright Eyes (1979), the pop love song (What A) Wonderful World (1977), the exquisite All I Know (1973)(one of my all time favourite songs) with it's incredible piano work, the old blues hit I Only Have Eyes For You and the gentle A Heart In New York (1981).This is a must have for any lover of good music, and a classic of 1970's music."
2,"Alright, if you absolutely HAVE to have a Garfunkel solo album...","This one is for you. But honestly now, the guy doesn't write--beautiful voice--but songwriting is a major appeal. So guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above Justin Timberlake. Ok, there are definitely highlihgts like a Heart in Newyork, (what a) wonderful world, but generally this a very casual compilation, good for a couple listens. in general, Art Garfunkel isn't really good for more than that. Check out him witht Paul Simon, that is amazing stuff, but this is kinda boring. I might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs--but even though there are good songwriters writing for him, the songs are still sub-par."
3,MUSIC TO REARRANGE YOUR SOCK DRAWER TO IN THE DARK,"A little of Artie goes along way. I'd like to hear what he sounds like in one of his frequent holding tank visits after being busted for possession. How's about a little rendition of Whole Lotta Love while ripped?After four or five cuts of this vapid pap, I want to go out and put my head on the railroad tracks just to experience some kind of rush.Can I have another Cafe Francais, s'il vous plait?"
4,Nothing wrong with this,"It's a shame that this disc has been as poorly reviewed as it has. The sheer presence of Charles Rytkonen's vocals ought to earn minimally 3 stars. The man has a distinctive voice that carries some power and emotion with it - think Savatage but with less emphasis of the upper ranges.Musically, there's nothing especially new being delivered here. It's basic, driving riff after basic, driving riff with a few texture breaks thrown in. Tempos stay within the same general groove for the most part and that might prove problematic for some folks wanting a true burner or ballad to break things up (track 8 Sorrow Calls starts balladesque but reverts to to a rocking/ballad hybrid and track 11 is their take on a Tolkien tune from Fellowship of the Ring... at least it is prior to their joking parody of Depeche Mode and a reggae song that is familiar but I just can't place).Reagrdless, if someone is looking for a solid power metal album, Morgana Lefay deliver."
4,your time wont be wasted,a great mix of jazz rock and mellow vibesto blend you in to a relaxing modeyou feel the passion of what shes singing aboutshes not just trying to make a living shes the genuine article hereshe loves what shes doing and it shows cant wait for the next albumshe will melt into you my time wasnt wastedmatt
3,Howard Soars!,"Fine score by Howard Shore. But, then I am biased. He was born on 18th October, which is also my birthday."
1,Alice in the Navy,I have seen this video before and I expected it to be in greek not in english-I wish it was clear that it was dubbed very badly.Very disappointing.
1,I loved the original version of this product,"I HATE the version I was sent with the new formulation. I really wish they hadn't done this. It doesn't appear to work any better than the old, and not only does my cat fight having it done (he didn't with the old formulation) he appeared almost ill from it (and that didn't happen with the old formulation).I wasted a lot of money on this because I thought I was getting the same formulation as what I had. I refuse to use it anymore because I don't want to make my cat sick.."
1,Cat owners be wary: foaming at the mouth,"This may work for some cats, but mine licked a bit off her fur and immediately began foaming at the mouth and drooling. She was so listless that she didn't even fight when I whisked her to the bath and got the damn stuff off her. If you do use this and have the same reaction, IMMEDIATELY wash it off thoroughly in the bath with dawn or some gentle dish soap and keep an eye on your pet. This stuff is better used for furniture than cats. Highly NOT recommended."
4,Very nice little knife for the price,I really needed a little knife I could carry around in my pocket that was light weight and had a belt clip on it. So far this knife has been great. the blade is very sharp and the blade when open and in the lock position is quite stable. It is slightly difficult to close the blade with one hand but that was not overly important to me in the first place. I have had this knife for 2 months now and i would definitly recommend it to anyone looking for a great little pocket knife (<3in.) for an everyday carry.
3,meh,"Its a decent knife. The locking mechanism makes it impossible to close one handed. Its difficult to even open one-handed. My biggest gripe with it is the belt clip. The heads of the screws that attach the belt clip to the knife protrude and make it more difficult to clip into the pocket of my pants, where I always attach the knife to carry around with me. The blade has been fine on it, but I would not buy this knife again, or recommend it to anyone."
5,Nice little knife.,Fits nicely in the pocket and is not bulky. Seems to stay sharp as I have used it for nearly a year to cut various things... mostly opening childrens toys which are ridiculously strapped in thier boxes.
2,Unworthy of the Gerber name,"Gerber must have changed the manufacturing outsource for this knife before I got one, because it's junk. Absolute junk. The machining quality is poor, the mechanism is absurdly stiff (opening it one-handed is basically impossible), and it wasn't even particularly sharp when I got it. The open edge of a tin can would be sharper.There is no country of origin mark on this knife, but I have been informed that Gerber is now outsourcing the manufacture of some of its smaller knives to China. I suspect this is the motive behind this knife's significant price reduction in recent months.It's really too bad. I have some older Gerber knives that are of exceptional quality, and they have always been razor sharp until now. Gerber, what happened to you?"
3,"Nice knife blade, questionable handle design","When this knife arrived, I was initially surprised at how small it is, however after handling it a bit, it was comfortable to open and close one-handed. It's very sharp as expected for a Gerber product. My main disappointment came when I tried clipping it into my jeans pocket. The design of the clip and it's attachment to the handle, creates a ""bump"" under the clip that has to be gotten past for the clip to securely hold the knife in the pocket. I foresee this as a problem, first with the likelihood of unnecessary wear on the pocket, and second, that the knife could accidentally be pocketed with the clip unsecured, making it easier to loose the knife. I'll be using it without the clip, in fact, I may remove it so I'm not tempted. Then again, the clip also works as a fingertip grip surface for one handed operation. I'd reconsider this design for another."
5,Great contrast with DeSoto,"By way of contrast with ""The Mystery of Capitalism"" by DeSoto, this book (read May 28) on this same topic is reviews events after the collapse of communism in Russia and details the movement toward capitalism. It looks at seven eastern European countries. It looks like it offers a more balanced view than the DeSoto book. There are good sections on the issue of property (p. 41) and how those issues are being fought over. In Russia, for example, they go over the various groups that have grabbed the property - ex- communists, mafias, etc.Patient ants will eventually enjoy higher standards of living than impatient crickets. Optimum levels of consumption are below the maximum - must save for the future. Topics: why private markets work, growth models."
3,"Fun colors, happy drawings in a cute guessing game book.","This book is full of repetition and rhyming fun. Timothy is at the park testing out his new telescope and thinks he keeps seeing a shark. Three of the pages have holes through them so that one might guess what he is seeing before the next page is turned. It never truly is a shark that he sees in the park but this is a fun book to read with a child ages 2-6 to see their expressions, guesses to the telescope hole page and reaction to what it really is that Timothy is seeing. This story would be fun to use in a kindergarten class when shapes are being taught."
4,Little ones think this is hilarious,"We stumbled across Shark in the Park at the library and had to buy it because my kids love it so much they would look for it at the library and get upset that it was always checked out. They are 4 & 5 years old and think it is just hilarious that the pictures looks like a shark is coming up in the next page, only to find out when you turn the page that the ""shark fin"" is really part of another picture that has nothing to do with a shark. Like the other reviewer, they love shouting out various parts to the story and even though they can't read yet, know the idea so well that they kind of paraphrase ""read"" it out loud to each other."
4,Write Time,I just ordered another one of these. I've been using one for over a year now and I really like this pen. I've been drawing and writing just about my entire life. Of my many hobbies drawing and writing are the most primordial.It seems I always have a writing instrument in my hands. I even made a living in the arts for a short time. So a good pen/pencil is essential for me. I really can't stand a cheap ill-conceived pen. But I'm also not rich and can't afford a Montblanc. The Pilot G2 Pro fits my bill perfectly. I would have given the G2 Pro 5 stars but the clip broke off not too long after buying it. Don't know how much of a problem-if any-this is.Nice ink flow. Great feel in my hands. Nice balance. Excellent Pen for the money.
4,"good, could be better.",These are rubber and will grind down if you flip your vehicle on cement enough times. They seem like you can get your moneys worth if you locate them in a location that wont get a lot of contact when you flip.
5,chely wright is the poop,shut up and drive is one of the best country songs ever...it is complemented by an array of songs that display chely's heavenly voice...a must have!
4,Wright turn,"I didn't like this album quite as much as ""Right in the Middle of It."" It's not quite as fun and catchy as that album; fewer quick tunes. There's good stuff here though, including:Your Woman Misses Her ManEmma Jean's Guitar - nice tune about history of a guitar and its former ownerIs It Love YetFeeling Single and Seeing Double"
4,"Provocative, beautiful even if you ""Don't like Country"".","This is beautiful music, and at times you can't believe the voice is real. But not for everyone this is what I'd class as a ""Girl"" C.D. Its got all the ""been there, done that"" tracks about men, love and the heartache they bring you. Basically most men just ""won't get it"". ""Shut Up and Drive"" played very, very loud will bring you out of any funk, by making you realize that you're not alone out there. A blind purchase by myself and it's a big hit in my C.D. rack."
4,A lot of tech for the money,"I can't believe this much watch can be had for about $40. The good: chock full of features, 10-yr battery, looks cool and keeps good time (so far). The bad: elaborate instructions for all its myriad features, weighs a lot more than I thought it would, pretty heavy even compared to old Rolexes and such."
1,It never arrived.,"The watch never arrived, so I am not able to review it. I was really looking forward to getting it."
3,Accurate time piece.,"This is a Timex! It keeps time as accurately as a Rolex or any other watch in the world. Plus it costs a lot less and keeps on ticking for a long long time. What's not to like. If you want bling buy jewelry.July, 2012 update --- Watch works great, in my pocket. The band broke! That's what not to like."
3,Timex watch,"This is decent looking watch. I gifted it to my dad. He loved it. The battery(cell) of watch died after 1 year 6 months.The band can be stretched which is good, but sometime it cuts the skin as it has sharp edges."
2,Overly vague book stops short,"I actually stopped reading this book after the first several chapters. I very seldom will stop reading books until giving them a fair shake, but I was so unimpressed with this book that I had to move on.The book spent alot of time examining the roots of why insects have been looked down upon for years. And they were interesting, except that the reasoning often used such cliches as ""many native tribes believe..."" Which native tribes? How do you define many? Then, at about the point the book seemed about to follow up the debunking of theories with proof, it would stop short with something like ""the reasons why the fly is good are beyond the scope of this book, suffice it to say that..."". I wanted proof and logic, not just 'believe me because I said so and overgeneralized in the process.'"
4,A good overview of Linux Programming,"This book is a good survey of the programming capabilities of Linux. It doesn't delve into much detail on different development environments, however."
1,Awful Book,This book is terrible. There is absolutely no editing - grammar and spelling are terrible.The content basically is dropping names with little supporting detail of people he has worked with or met during his career. I wasted my money on a used copy of this book.
3,Country Music memories from a Yeoman Player,"Tony Farr's memoir is an entertaining journey through his career as a steel guitar player. Born in New Orleans, Tony's playing took him to Dallas and then to Nashville. He recounts the bands with which he played, the honky tonks in which he performed, and the famous characters he met on the way. Most interesting is his account of playing country music in and around New Orleans during the 1950s, a poorly documented but important scene. He even mentions my buddy Harold Cavallero as one of the great steel players at the time. Tony's book is written pretty much as I imagine he talks. There are some unique spellings that only add to the charm of this all too brief book. A must for those who want to know more about country music than what the ""big"" stars have to say."
2,An Incomplete Disappointment,"I have to say this title was a disappointment both in terms of the text and art work.The main discussion is of Hittite, Egyptian and Mycenaean chariots, all better covered (in my opinion)in other Osprey books. I was very disappointed that a book on Bronze Age chariot warfare had little mention of the Hurrian system which created an aggressive contemporary empire based on new chariot techniques which formed the basis for horse training, organization, chariot construction, and the arming of the warriors for all to follow. As for the art work, other books in the series are far superior. I am a storng supporter of Osprey with some 60+ of their books, but this one was not among their best. Actuially, I would hope this title would be re-done as it has such potential.Mark"
2,Kindle problems,"The book is great. The words are great. The translation to the Kindle format are teh suck.I believe in the double space at the end of a sentence. That makes me a minority member now. But it would have avoided a lot of infelicities in the text. These problems made it difficult to follow the narrative. When one finds something on the order of""and the Mohammad Ali fell to the canvas and his trainer""Dundee""one cannot help but find it, um, offputting?The simple lack of the space detroys the flow of the story.Sorry, friends, but you're better off getting this on deadtree.(BTW, I do copyediting) (Cheap)"
1,Trash,"A mean-spirited attempted trashing of the Ali legend. He even blames Ali for Mike Tyson raping Desiree Washington. But what more can be expected from a ""man"" -- Cashill -- who still believes the Vietnam war to be ""just"" and ""right"".Ignore this book like the plague."
1,Hitman for the Ultra right.,"An unbridled hit piece nothing more. This book relies on Cashill personal observations and opinions and is short on fact. The few facts that are put forward have glaring inaccuracies that make them useless, calling into question the author's motives and research abilities. Another attempt to rewrite history and as usual it is very poorly done."
1,sucker punched...,The author is entitled to HIS opinion. That is all this book is. The writer carefully leaves out facts that might compromise his story or viewpoint. Muhammad Ali may not have been perfect; but neither is this book...
1,this Book stanks,"if you want to read on the Greatest then Read Thomas Hauser's Book. Cashill is on some Right Wing Agenda. he wants to be-little Muhammad Ali&talks in a Modern day Bill O'Reily/ Rush Limbagh type of aingle. how can anybody write a Book that trys to flip what Muhammad Ali said back in the day when there was strong Racial,social&Other tensions in the United States?? this Book is a Bad Joke. Cashill is the Sucker who got Agenda Punch to try to take down Muhammad Ali,but nobody can ever sway Me on Muhammad Ali. He was the Voice for Hope. He is a Powerful Force that touched Lived all over the World&still has a Impact that hasn't been felt since. this Book stanks,is loaded&Racist."
1,punch drunk,"This book is so worthless it's barely worth the effort to denigrate! Cashill, an allegedly human construction/cyborg, tries his best to rewrite the last fifty or so years of American history. Ignore him. If you're interested in The Greatest (yeah, Cashill-tron, Ali is the Triple Greatest of All Time! Of All Time!), read David Remnick's King of the World. If interested in MLK, Taylor Branch's remarkable biography. If interested in Robots, watch Lost in Space...."
1,"Trash, trash, utterly shameful RepubliKKKlan trash","Many fine writers (Norman Mailer, Tom Wolfe, Hunter S. Thompson, Davis Miller, David Halberstam, Hugh McIlvanney, David Remnick, among numerous others) have written beautifully, insightfully and brilliantly well about this most celebrated and admired of athletes.This non-writer and his non-book are disgustingly reprehensible trash."
4,A blessing to me,"Songs in this album are more of the slow types. Emphasis is placed more on worship songs. Sounds a bit ""mechanical"" too. But the words are hard to beat as usual. In all , not a bad one if your taste is more on worship music from Hillsongs."
1,"This ""film"" is pure, unadulterated trash.","This is a sick, cornball piece of amateurish trash, trying to masquerade as a sophisticated European slice-of-life. Tom Berenger notwithstanding, this film is junque. Life is precious; don't waste time, money, or effort on going to see this dribble; file it in #13."
1,Black & white reprint - no good,"I am returning the copy I've just received for a refund. This is a classic which, in the original, has wonderful colour plates. The low quality black & white reproduction is useless and pointless."
1,terrible product,"I recently had recessed lighting installed in my living room and bathroom and two different contractors both used these lightbulbs. I assume the bulbs were new when installed. Within three months, eleven out of the nineteen bulbs had failed at average usage rates of three hours or less daily. I'm guessing the contractors used the Sylvania bulbs because they get some massive discount due to the brand's dismal performance. I will not buy Sylvania again."
2,Outdated,"While this isn't a bad book to pick up some basic Unix background and shell scripting skills, the beginner would be better served by one of the O'Reilly books. The scripts presented in the book are useful; so useful that most of them can already be found on a modern Unix system, which reduces the incentive to type these in and understand them."
3,Less salt not the same as lower salt,"I purposed a 40 pack kit directly from the seller for family movie night after finding this brand's regular popcorn kits to be way too salty for us. The popcorn tastes lighter in flavor/oil but just as salty as the regular kit. Also, there seems to be less popcorn contained in the packages than in the original kits that came with the popper. Certainly not 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels as there is noticeable room when you lift the lid, and the unpopped kernels do not account for this difference.I like the convenience of having everything in one package but expected a discernable difference in the saltiness. As a workaround, I have to reserve the salt packet content."
1,Does not seem to reflect what PRAXIS says is on the exam.,"I am prepering to take this cert, as I have been teaching the class. I ordered this book to get a better idea of the exam. It has LOTS of bizarre questions about things like how to set up a camp and how many seats an infirmary must have... but none of this seems to be reflected on current PRAXIS guidelines for the test. I will update this review IF the book's questions do reflect the actual test.ALSO, beware, it just gives questions and answers. There are no explanations for any of the answers. So, most of the time, it's shrug and move on. Not helpful. At all.(*)>"
4,very green,"The quality is what I expected, the color is a little darker and emerald than I thought. I will still keep them but I wish the color were a little more subtle."
2,"Interesting Design, Execution Falls Short","After trying a myriad of Apple OEM lanyards and Chinese variants found on eBay, I decided that I would find and purchase the most durable lanyard possible. With its unique coupler and polycarbonate case, the Rivet was supposed to be that product. While the polycarbonate housing does appear virtually indestructible, the audio cables are not. After a few months use, the headphones stopped working. So, I have non-functional iPod necklace. For whatever reason, I have bad luck with such products as I use my iPod for both bicycle riding and weight lifting.The only lanyard headphones that have demonstrated any durability are the PodAlchemy lanyard headphones (not yet sold on Amazon, but can find on Ebay) used with a separate sleeve, the toughskin (see review).In short, the Rivet Lanyard was a nice try but just didn't hold up under conditions where the iPod would be swinging back and forth, such as during exercise."
1,kind of fits....,"I recently purchased this charger. Service was great and it arrived promptly. I was disappointed with the fit into my phone. I guess these universal chargers have to fit into many phones, so a really good fit is out of the question. Also, my phone is not holding a charge long..."
5,A light in the wilderness has emerged,"With the possible exception of Tom Wolfe, few authors today have the courage to write their style. They are worried that the major houses will can them because readers don't have the attentiion span to absorb their highest art.Well here is proof that fine literature can be discovered and published in this country!This fine work dances on the interface between prose and poetry.Most highly recommended."
1,If you make it the first 250 pages you are home free,"This book soooo slow in getting to the point and heart of the story on nearly every level. So much time is spent reflecting on the details of the landscape and early coastal living that I never really find out anything meaningful about the characters, or the driving force of the story-the hurricane. I have heard of slow build-ups, but this was just agony. I wonder if anyone could really live the way the author portrays- constantly in the narcissistic annals of their own mind, without regard for those around them or others feelings. If a character examines something over and over, it doesn't make them empathetic. In the same way, if you put words down together for 300 pages, it doesn't make it a book."
3,"Worth reading, but flawed.","As you can tell from reading the reviews below, some readers love this book and some readers hate it. Why? Because the language is lovely and the writer has an interesting idea, but, frankly, the novel does become tedious. Great setting, interesting characters, great idea to use the Hurricane of 1938 for a climax. But the writer needs to concentrate on the craft of plot. The book badly needs forward movement."
2,A tedious journey,"Being a reader who likes historical novels with lyrical prose, I was sure this would be a great read. To the contrary, it was a tedious journey to nowhere. I made myself finish the novel and was relieved when the end came. I'm sure the author was trying to bring the novel to life in vivid detail but it became lumbersome just plodding through it."
1,tired and tedious,"Rarely does a book come around that manages virtually zero movement from beginning to end. This story is slow, almost unbearably so...the narrative is confusingly told from multiple points of view, and that might be okay if any of them had something interesting to say. Unfortuntely they don't, because the plot is so slow in developing and the characters so lifeless that it leaves the reader with few places to turn- except to the unskilled prose of a first time author that seems so enamored with the sounds of her own voice that she has completely lost any regard for the reader. I wanted to like this book, I really did- but it is hard to embrace a story as poorly executed and ill concieved as this one. Perhaps the author should give up on the histroical constructs and the multiple personalities of the narrator and try being real for a change. There is a difference between knowing the path, and walking the path."
1,"slow, ponderous, and boring","I had such high hopes for this book- until I read it! There could have been so much more going for this story based on the subject matter. The character development is almost non- exist, the story has no arch, and the trite mismatched metaphors and confusing descriptions(""he had eaten the pages""?) left me confused about the authors lack of connection to both the reader and the character. The prose seemed to get lost in the head of the author- not in the head of the character- and that made the book both difficult and unenjoyable to read."
1,Embarassing,"I wanted to enjoy this book however I could not. There was more description than story. It was so discriptive that this reader forgot what was being described! In my opinion, I think the author missed an opportunity to create a story from the era and S.E. MA and blew it."
1,Bored to tears..how does one get a refund,"I bought this book because of some interest in the New England coastal communities of the time. However, this book is bad. And not just bad in the pedestrian sense...I mean shockingly, train wreck, unjustifiable as to how it ever could have been published bad. The book jacket says the author went to Harvard..maybe her college roommate is the editor at Random House now, because other than that there would be no reason to ever bring these words to print. And I say ""words"" as opposed to ""story' because there is no story here- just the almost incomprehensible rambling on of yet another young author more in love with the sound of her own voice than with conveying anything of substance to the reader. If that is all the author Tripp cares to do- then I suggest that she sticks to writing in her journal and save everyone else the anguish of reading this peice of dreck."
1,Very very difficult and disconcerting,"Usually I like a challenging book- it makes me feel a tiny bit superior to celebrity culture of most books yu find lining the shelves. But in this case I had to take a step back and decide weather or not to hack through this very dense, very convuluted plot and prose. It truly is an effort that I doubt very few will be willing to wade through. It is the kind of book I suspect many at first would think they want to read- but because of the stagnant plot and too many narrative voices I'm sure most will never finish."
5,A novel worth savoring,"Reading Moon Tide, to me, was like savoring a nice, full-bodied glass of red wine. I not only read Dawn Clifton Tripp's words, I swallowed them. It is simply that rich. She went where most authors do not dare to go - to the otherworldly spiritual place where dreams are formed. This is precisely where real awakenings can occur. Tripp treats her characters with the same respect she has for the coastal setting for the stories. Her characters, like the landscape, are powerful and earthy. In her characters, she weaves the dark and light in a sympathetic, natural way. Like the landscape, they are rich, complex, beautiful, luminous, and dark. Ultimately, Eve is the story of so many of us who shut down. Yet, what was so compelling was how natural and gentle she is with the characters who face pain and also cause pain. She writes like someone with life experience beyond her years. This is so much more than a regional novel, it is the very organic stuff of life."
2,I gave it 2 stars because of the cover photo...,"otherwise, I was bored to tears. I kept closing the book to look at the photo and found more to it than all the words inside the book."
1,"Lovely vignettes, but they simply don't fit together","I grew up and live in the area where this book is set, so I thought I wuld give it a try. While there are a few lovely passages in it, they tend to trail away from any thread to the main story- which tends to get lost in the myriad of voices used by the author in some type of attempt to create tension and drama in the circumstances of the story. The author seems to get lost in the details of the characters thoughts, while forgetting the biggest detail of all: that there has to be some kind of movement in order to push the story forward."
4,So much better...,"I am still amazed this album does not have one review??!? It's actually very good. It's classic ""indie-electronica"" at its best. It's sincere, quirky, playful and heartfelt all at once.Originally written as an alternate soundtrack for Beverly Hills Cop, many years after the movie came out. This alone, gives you an idea where these guys are coming from.The lyrics paint a vivid picture of a man from the east, caught in the Cali scene of the 80s, all tongue in cheek of course. Best penny I have ever spent (before shipping)! You can listen to it on their website and see if it's for you.""Tiny lakes in Michigan, better than Pacific coast"" - so true."
2,Wrong Book,"This book was purchased by mistake. The book was meant for use with Windows XP.I switched to a new computer with Windows7, the book arrived, and was not applicable to the new operating system. I subsequently bought another book on the subject of moviemaking, ""Getting Started With Windows Live Movie Maker"", and found that book very good."
3,Just not for me..,"To much reading,I needed more visuals. It jumps around a bit to. I would Recommend ""Movie Maker 2 Visual Quickstart Guide By Jan Ozer"""
4,Microsoft Windows Movie Maker 2: Do Amazing Things,Great book with great tips. They made it simple and answered a lot of my questions.
4,get it used,"It's a really good book if you want to make MM your primary edit platform. Try to get it used. New books, no matter the subject, are just way too expensive."
3,The best version I found,"I needed to read this extremely dated play for work, and found this to be a good edition. Better notes than most of the editions. It's not a great play, and its language is arcane even by classical theater standards, but if you want to read it, go ahead and read this version."
5,A Fun Play!,"Malevole, the title character of Marston's masterpiece, has good reason to be a malcontent: he is the disguised, deposed rightful ruler of Genoa. The play is a collection of intrigues, questions as to who knows what about whom, and disguises. It is a great joy to read and one of my favorite pieces of Renaissance literature.The New Mermaid edition is very nice, with a good introduction, but the language has been modernized more than in most editions."
4,Could see this one on the big screen!!,"Very well written, fast-moving, intelligent dialogue among the main characters. Very likable heroine (at times, though, I could have wrung her neck for not seeing what she had in Joe fast enough -- but that's just me); a totally ""fall-in-love instantly"" type of hero!! If this were made into a movie, I could easily see Simon Baker as ""Joe."" He has dreamy eyes and a drop dead gorgeous smile -- just like Joe. Good book, fast read. I only gave it 4 stars though because I would have liked to have read more on their ""happily ever after..."" Didn't want it to end!! :-("
3,It was just okay,"I read the back cover while browsing at a local bookstore. I ended up checking it out from the library a week later. It sounded funny and it was an added bonus that it took place in DC. It was just ok... at times I found my mind wandering and had to re-read pages. I wouldn't say not to read it, but if there's another book that you're anxiously waiting to read, I would suggest you read that book first."
3,Drink Coffee,"This is the second book I've read by Elaine Fox. Thank god it wasn't my first; I don't know that I could have been persuaded to give her another try otherwise.While the writing was good, and the characters likeable and well-developed, I found this a slow read. I almost felt like I was forcing myself to finish towards the end.I felt like the story didn't really move and the characters were stuck. They kept doing the same thing repeatedly. Like Laurel trying to convince herself and Joe that love is not the answer to a long lasting relationship. I never understood why she felt this way, aside from a book she read that made the suggestion.I also never felt a lot of chemistry between Joe and Laurel. They seemed more like best friends than hot and passionate lovers. I would recommend this book if you're a fan of Elaine Fox and want to read all of her work. However you could probably skip this one and be fine."

4,Great cd,"I bought this cd soon after becoming a Christian.I enjoyed listening to the other Hillsong Cd's so i got this one as well to build my collection.You get to hear the songs from time to time as alot of churches do sing the Hillsong songs as well.They certainly are a fast growing church,and the music itself is exciting.You have the songs that you can sing to as well as the slow spiritual songs.Great mixture here,but all the Hillsong Cd's are good.This one was recorded in 1997."
1,Not-So-Cute,"If you order this sewing machine, be aware that the company says there is NO WARRANTY, and NO PARTS are available. Think twice before purchasing one at a flea market, unless all parts and instructions are present."
1,Disappointment,"Gave This Sew Cute Sewing machine to my Granddaughter for Christmas, and it did not sew. I returned the sewing machine"
2,Disappointed,"It was much smaller than I anticipated and the instructions were not very clear. Although it was sold as new, it was obviously around for a very long time. The box was damaged and faded and the styrofoam stuck to the product. This discourages me from buying online."
5,Hazel Atlas Glass,"What a great book, I had borrowed one from a friend and had to have one for myself. It is so handy to have in my business."
3,Not impressive,"If you know absolutely nothing about psychic abilities - or you're sceptical about them - this little book could serve as a solid introduction. It deals with the power of positive thinking, self-hypnosis and other topics in Hewitt's trademark no-nonsense, ""everyone can do it"" manner.However, the book's level is VERY basic and, regardless of its price, it's not worth the money if you are interested in learning a lot about mind power. Get Psychic Development For Beginners instead: it's way more about the same thing and it even has the same examples that are in this book (My guess is that Truth About Mind Power is a ""demo version"" of PDFB)."
1,steve,"Man, this is a great show if you have problems sleeping!!! To describe it in three words: ""Mother of BORING"". Enjoy!"
4,Great Book for Any Church Leader,"As a leader of Women's Ministries in my church, I needed a training book to encourage and teach the Women's Ministry Board. The principles stated in this book are very important to ministry at any level. It involves the personal and spiritual disciplines important to setting the right model of leadership. Our ladies team has enjoyed the study of this book and find if helpful. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the principles of leadership."
4,"Patsy, we hardly knew ye!","Patsy Cline's career was short, but brilliant. This live recording is a chance to hear her while her star was still on the rise. I was prepared for the worst after reading about the poor sound quality, but I was pleasently surprised. As a fan of obscure blues field recordings, I've heard much worse. If you're already a fan of Patsy, and in all honesty you should be before buying this CD, the sound glitches won't bother you at all. For established fans, it's a chance to hear Patsy in real world conditions: singing with a different band every night, taking requests and putting up with the primitive PAs of the day. What a talent! What a trouper!"
1,Love at the Cimmarron Ballroom - Patsy Cline,"This album is not for the average bear. I found the quality of the tape from which the CD was made was much too poor to enjoy. The write-up said a ""couple glitches"". There are many , many glitches, including a couple of tracks competing with feedback in the sound system at the Cimmarron. Much of the sound overdrives the mike and distorts the louder passages. The write-up should emphasize that the value of the CD is as a collector item...not a typical music performance.I returned mine and got ""The Patsy Cline Story"" in its place. That one is perfect quality and a pleasure to listen to...loud and singing along, or softly in the backgroud while enjoying a sunset."
1,The Poor Quality of This Recording Needs to Be Emphasized,"This should not be anyone's first Patsy Cline album. Or even second or third. It's perhaps only for the connoisseur who's heard lots of recordings of all of her work and desperately needs something different.Yes, sure, she's great, but this CD often sounds like an AM radio not quite tuned to the right frequency. It may be historically significant, a rare live recording, etc. but there have to be more pleasant ways to listen to Patsy Cline's renditions of country classics."
5,love it,"Worked great on my tattoo, I felt better about have it on my skin than regular lotion. It healed really well and the balm smelled like yummy beeswax!"
2,It is what it is,"This book is basically a comparison of good & bad designs as related to the topics in the subtitle. There is not much depth to any of the examples so it feels like this is the outline of a book that never got finished.I was looking for something comprehensive enough to allow me to make better informed decisions, even if the book didn't offer an example that is specific to my problem. This book is NOT that."
5,Excellent book for reading and for reference,"""Defensive Design for the Web"" is an incredible book - every bit of it was informative and helpful. I will be keeping this book handy for years to come!"
4,A must read for every software developer,Software development is much too often considered a technical issue. This book takes the perspective of the user. Software would be much more user friendly if software developer took this kind of information into consideration. It is a real must read for serious software developers.
2,Too much emphasis on error reporting/recovery,"The sub title of this book should stop at ""How to Improve Error Messages"". The focus of the book is on recovering from problems, either from user input or from the system. That's all well and good and their ideas are fine. However I was hoping they'd spend some time talking about how to lay out your forms so they are mor effective and less likely to cause problems for the user in the first place.Especially useful would have been web oriented techniques for forms that span multiple pages.Anyway they didn't put it in the book and that's their choice. What they put in is servicable if all you're interested in is recovery."
4,Smack you in the head common sense!,"I received the book two days ago and have managed to finish it in between projects. It is the kind of book that you read and say 'well duh' I know that, but which also makes you think 'but am I doing it?'Short and easy to read. Informative and thought provoking. Would've got five stars if they had provided me some code samples to keep me from having to search for them. I will be passing it on to my colleagues."
2,Not So Much,"The contents of this paperback would make an interesting series of articles, but it lacks the depth needed for any good book. Everything is already upfront in the table of contents and it does not go into any real substance inside. Although the authors do provide some good ideas, they don't suggest anything that isn't already common sense to those in the web development field. The problem is that the book makes no assumptions about the type of site that you're running or the server environment, so it doesn't tell you how to achieve anything. If you are new to the web management field, you might find this a good choice. Anyone else will probably feel cheated."
5,Featuring 40 guidelines to prevent errors,"Defensive Design For The Web: How To Improve Error Messages, Help, Forms, And Other Crisis Points by the ""37 signals"" team of Matthew Linderman and Jason Fried is a straightforward guide for web designers to creating sites that are less likely to encounter problems that give the browser errors such as ""file not found"" or worse. Black-and-white screenshots and highlighted tips add a strong visual and example component to the discussed principles. Featuring 40 guidelines to prevent errors, hundreds of real-world examples from companies like Amazon and Google, a simple test to evaluate one's own site, and much more, Defensive Design For The Web is a ""must-have"" resource for anyone charged with building or maintaining a website bigger than a digital breadbox."
3,"Okay, but better books exist","I like the idea, of improving the choke points of a website, but this book doesn't execute it too well. It's mostly just compare and contrast of various websites, and really you could cut this book in half and just illustrate all the good practices that Amazon.com (which the authors constantly fawn over) does.It's a good idea, and a much needed book on the subject, but I just think they could condense it down to all the things you should do and leave out all the picking on cruddy websites stuff."
1,A laserprinted book!!?!?!,These guys may know something about online legibility but I'd suggest they have a thing or two to learn about offline publishing - this book looks like it has been laser printed on a Xerox that is running out of toner AND THEN photocopied twice before being bound and sold as a real book!The diagrams to which the content refers are so low quality that you cannot see what is being refered to - ie you can't read the text! To that end I haven't finished the book as I'm still somewhat annoyed at it - bad user interface design ;-)I don't know if this is New Riders being cheap or 37 Signals being uninformed but I will certainly think twice about buying anything from them again.
1,Awful,"I have to say that this book was absolutely no help to me whatsoever. On the strength of the reviews here, I purchased this book for help on a corporate redesign project two weeks ago, read it cover to cover, and set it aside in disgust. There was literally nothing in it of value. Unfortunately, as it now shows wear I cannot in good conscience return it to the store. Anyway, I don't know what the deal is with the glowing reviews - I only wish the one from ""porterhouse"" had been posted before I drove down to the store. That review, honestly, is the only one that's got it right."
4,A must if you are starting out,"I have read a few books on this topic and found this book to be good for those that are begining to do professional development and it also serves as a good review for those that have been developing for a while.The book is simple in its layout and each section is easy to read by itself or you could read it from cover to cover if you wanted to. I found myself skipping around some and just skimming some areas of the book.Its not a must have, but it is a good to have."
4,so much flavor,"i can't give 5 stars because i haven't tried tons and tons of hot sauces... but this one just has an unmistakable, smoky, savory flavor that goes great on so many things. it has a very nice kick, but not overwhelming. every time i open this bottle and get a taste of it's smokey goodness my mouth starts watering. it's a must try!!!"
2,"Like a really tired version of ""Death Wish""/""Walking Tall""","A really basic plot that you've already picked up from the previous reviewers. Slow moving, and honestly seemed very amateurish to me."
3,just ok,The actors are good. Cox is at the top of his game. The story not that original. Some scenes in the movie put you in a room with no explanation as to why the characters are there. The relationship(?) between Cox and the reporter doesn't jell. But Cox is enough to make one watch.
2,Boring,Not a movie that keeps your attention. I found after the first fifteen minutes you waited for something to happen that never did until the end. I rate it a two out of five.
3,quilting kansas dorothy,several of the patterns brought back memories of the quilts that I slept under as a child. and several called to me to use them to create something for those that i want to have those types of memories.
1,And What Exactly Was So Special?,This book was a bore and I can't imagine how this person even published a book. The literary world has been turned upside down by this morass of bad literature that's sweeping the landscape. Awful!
2,Puzzled?????,I really don't know what to say about this book.It's like it had potential to be a good book but it didn't quite make it.It was good that it was an up to date book meaning it centered around a character making a change because of 9/11 and then you had a person struggling with religion but other than that it really didn't do anything for me.Fed Up with the Fanny and A Cup Of Love were really good books but I read this and I'm like what happened.
1,Not that good,"I was excited to hear that the band was getting back to record a show. I finally tracked down the dvd and I wasn't too impressed with the sound. There were planety of mistakes, but that can be forgiven on the fact that teh group hadn't been together that long. I was wanting more from the singer. He didn't seem to have the vocals for the type of music. Its good to have for the die hard Vengenace fans though. The interview is pretty cool."
5,align with your truth or perish,A phenomenal but probably very unpopular movie as many of us go to work everyday forsaking our dreams and living out a life of drudgery. The last scene as the man turns his hearing aid off directly foretells how we stick our heads in the sand on so much of life's issues.
4,Good performance by the actors,"Revolutionary Road may feature the stars of Titanic - Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet - but there's no Titanic love story here. It's the end of the line for a marriage. Frank and April Wheeler had hopes and dreams when they first got married but all they ended up with was disillusionment. A good performance by the actors, but not a movie for those looking for an uplifting story."
2,Odd Movie....Didn't Work For Me!!,"Besides all the yelling and smoking in seemingly every scene, I did not like this movie. It just didn't seem to work. Kate and Leo are a couple who for some reason don't get along. Their realtor, Bates, drops in on them and brings her mentally unstable adult son. Why? It doesn't seem to fit in the story line....oh, but then again I didn't really see a story line. At times the background music makes it seem as if something is going to happen...but it doesn't.Kate finds out she is pregnant and doesn't want the baby. The story shifts then to whether she will self abort the baby. Odd turn right?Kate's character goes from Susie homemaker to ranting banshee. WHy? No idea. WHats up with the weird relationship with the neighbors? No idea. The movie just doesn't flow right.Glad I didn't pay for this in the theater."
4,"Unsettling, uncomfortable...brilliant","First I just have to say Kate Winslet just keeps getting better with time. No disrespect to Leo, but it seemed to me that in this production that Winslet blew Dicaprio out of the water. Dicaprio has proven he can play a wide range of characters but a '50 suit man-not so much. It's not that he was bad, it's just that Winslet ws just so much better. I could absolutely feel her angst even when I didn't agree with her choices. The book is still in my TBR pile, I can't wait to get to it so see how everything stacked up."
3,"Disappointing ""Road""","Just recently saw this on Blu-Ray, and unfortunately despite the casting of Winslet and DiCaprio, the film was a respectable failure. I say ""respectable"" because despite Mendes' direction and the attention to the '50s setting, I felt a sense of ""deja vu"" to this film that I didn't have to ""American Beauty"". If it weren't for Michael Shannon excellent rendering of a dysfunctional character, I would probably knock this down 2 stars but in fact his appearance gives this film the needed spark to rescue it from pure tedium. I'm sure the book was very poetic but unfortunately it did not translate to film so well. If you really want to see Winslet at her best, check out ""The Reader""."
