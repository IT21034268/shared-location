5,Just when it was getting good...........,"It ended. The book itself was good. I have to admit it took me a while to get into in the begining but i made it through. Rio is a strong character and his ""bonnie"" Trinty was just as strong. They both just had goals in life they wanted to achieve but things just get in the way. I like this book and it would be added to my book collection at my crib.shamel (Mel) he dearly was a true friend to Rio.Cutty he never went soft on Rio.Joyce you got yoursTruck either way it was going to happen but i just wish the hound was there to see and help out.When you read this book you'll understand everything i'm typed on this screen. But $15.00 or cheaper its worth itBrandesha"
1,"Another ghetto garbage ""novel""","I'm sick of this. Aren't you? Please stop being timid and get counted, so we can send these big white corporate publishers a message that we aren't all ignorant, with no taste in literature. These people should stick to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas."
3,Okie Dokie!!!,"The book was a little slow. But the characters showed real depth. It felt like.....""Yeah I've been there."" Makes an Aight read. You might want to try this over the weekend, or a break period."
2,Not His Best Work,"I really didn't enjoy this book. There was too many characters and too much going on. I was drawn to the book in the beginning, b/c I am from Douglass projects in NYC to. But after reading the book, it was exaggerated alittle to much for me. Trust me save your money. Although Trinity and Rico was a ghetto romeo and juliet. Their love story was great. But the other gangsta stuff that was going on was wack."
4,Only the strong survive,"I've never read a K'wan book, after coming away from it I was very impressed with his storytelling and development of his characters. I will say after reading tons of street fictions, I can't say there were no big surprises in terms of its climactic ending. Yet again the story itself is enjoyable to keep yourself hooked and entertained."
1,WASTED EFFORT,"THis is a embarassing effort by Dream Works studios. A total bomb. The movie doesn't gives what promises in the cover: a good comedy. Instead, the movie is a shameful mixture of cheap drama with bad acting all over the place. I guess there are some two funny moments at maximum in the movie. Really bad history, badly executed."
1,very bad,"A crap, total waste of time. Capshaw is totally out of shape here. TOm Selleck is totally unconvincent and lost. Anyway, the fault belongs to the script, which is a total mess."
1,WASTED EFFORT,"THis is an embarassing effort by Dream Works studios. A total bomb. The movie doesn't gives what promises in the cover: a good comedy. Instead, the movie is a shameful mixture of cheap drama with bad acting all over the place. I guess there are some two funny moments at maximum in the movie. Really bad history, badly executed."
2,Not one to see twice,"The storyline, that of a love letter discovered by first one, and thenanother character in a sleepy seashore town, each one thinking it hadbeen written for them, is delightful, and suggests endlesspossibilities, but I found myself rolling my eyes more than once atthe overkill of some of the characters expressions. At other times Icouldn't help laughing helplessly over the soulful looks 20-year-oldJohnny (Tom Everett Scott) gave 40-something bookstore owner Helen(Kate Capshaw) as he imagined that she had meant the love letter forhim.My biggest disappoint ...[is that] there is no warning in anyof the reviews or otherwise, that this film has overt lesbian tonesbefore its completion. I would not have chosen this video if I hadknown this."
3,"There's no ""in between""...","By the looks of previous customer reviews, you'll either love or hate ""The Love Letter"". I'd never heard of the film, and happened upon it quite by accident while channel surfing. It may have been the late hour, my mood, the whimsical characters, or the beautiful backdrop, but I found it delightful. --Definitely not a an Oscar contender; but an endearing little gem nonetheless. Just the thing for a rainy day, curled up with a bowl of popcorn. (CHICK FLICK ADVISORY: Not recommended for Steven Segal, Sylvester Stallone, or Jean Claude Van Damme fans!)"
4,A GOOD MOVIE!,"I seldom watch a whole movie in one sitting, but this film is an exception. First of all, it's not really a comedy, although it has its moments. It's all about romance, and a surprise ending. The acting is excellent. It's nice to see Tom Selleck in a sensitive, non-action role. He's pretty good! The pacing is excellent: the movie stays interesting from start to finish. You really get involved with the characters. Ellen plays a STRAIGHT role, and she gets a lot of you-know-what, but it's done is a nice, humorous fashion. In closing, if you like GILLMORE GIRLS, or romance novels, or just interesting SLICE-OF-LIFE drama, get this one--and don't believe the bad reviews:THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE, AND WELL WORTH ITS LOW COST."
4,Loved the Love Letter,I saw this on TV and loved it. I ordered four copies for friends. Hope they like it as much as I did. It is so nice to enjoy a movie thathas decent language and no violence. Sure wish they had more movies like this one.
2,lame...,"this film was okay...i really dislike Kate capshaw and didn't care to see this movie, it probably could have been better if someone rewrote the script, and chose a better actress than capshaw. This is a novel by Cathleen Schine. the book is probably much better! ellen degeneres was the best part of the whole film! she is a very funny commedianne and a charming actress. if you like her, you might like this film somewhat.. it's also filmed in Rockport, MA which is a beautiful spot.."
3,Kate Capshaw & Tom Selleck At Their Best,"This movie was cute, sweet, funny, lite, and well paced. Be forwarned that there are lesbian characters who talk about their fulfillment in lesbianism. The writer of ""The Love Letter"" is Maria Maggenti. Her previous effort, ""The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love (1995)"", was a lesbian love story. The Lesbian sub-plot aside, the whole ensemble did a good job, with Capshaw being the best; although a fling between this 40-something and an 18 yr old boy is a bit of a stretch."
4,"Fairly enjoyable, and Kate Capshaw is totally...","...GORGEOUS...just a pleasure to watch her in this movie, the camera really knows how to bring out the goddess in her, she is exquisite! Amazing that she was 46 at the time. Mama mia, this film would be a potent recruiting tool for The International MILF/Cougar Fan Club, lol.Ellen Degeneres also puts in an excellent performance, the rest of the cast is solid, though I didn't even recognize Tom Selleck since his ""Magnum P.I."" days---looks about a good 60lbs heavier!I like that this film's ending was hopeful but open-ended...not the usual schmaltzy ""happily ever after into the sunset"" crap that too many romantic comedies sell out to at the end. The music is very nice too, reminded me of a Woody Allen film soundtrack.This is not exactly a grand artistic film, but still quite enjoyable and plenty of eye candy, decent acting and dialogue, not overly flaky or cliche-ridden like most of this genre."
5,Highly Under-Rated Gem!,"This is a rare, intelligent, hilarious, romantic comedy with a stellar cast. It's quirky, touching, and unpredictable, with multiple love stories all going on at once. Don't miss the WONDERFUL Geraldine McEwan as Miss Scattergoods...although she doesn't have top billing, she steals every scene she's in. It's the kind of film you can watch over and over without getting bored. Highly under-rated!"
3,Love Letter,"This movie is good to see once and maybe the second time two years later. It's the type that you just don't know what to think of when you're done watching.The best thing about this movie is the actual Love Letter. ""when i peel an orange, when i drive my car...."" The sheer normalness of everday experiences expressed through the letter endear it to the reader (or listener)."
2,It could've been better,"The movie isn't exactly bad, the problem is that it could've been a lot better. The main problem is the way characters are managed through the movie, what give us a movie which centers mainly in only one character (Kate Capshaw's), and leaves the rest of the cast unatended and undeveloped, which is a shame, most of all to Ellen DeGeneres and Julianne Nicholson's characters, because these two give the best acting in the movie. The other problem is that a movie with really one character is not necesarilly bad, had it not been that Kate Capshaw acting is so flat and boring, that one ends up not caring for the character.In a brief: Bad script, lousy direction, dreadful lead actress, good supporting cast; but poorly managed with very little on-screen time."
1,I wish I could give it less than 1 star,"Boring, Boring, Boring. I was so bored by the whole thing, I didn't care who the stupid letter was from. I couldn't keep from falling asleep. Everything about this movie..."
5,Enchanting,"This is a fun film. It has heart and charm, but oh, Capshaw works her magic here. I would buy this film for no other reason than to watch Capshaw's performance--it was incredible acting."
1,"Good idea for a movie, didn't reach it's potential","Because of the cast list, the basic idea of the plot and the scenery, you would expect a much cuter film. Instead you get a lot of sex without so much romance, while the eventual romantic connection lacks passion. Very odd. I expected more humor!"
3,Beautiful yet not all it could have been,"I recently rented this after an acquaintance recommended it. I really love the way that the filmmakers used coastal Massachusetts towns to create the gorgeous locations in the fictitious ""Loblolly-by-the-Sea"".When watching, I found myself wishing that the two main characters, Helen and Johnny, had less screen time. I did not find these characters emotionally compelling or interesting. Some of the secondary characters had more intriguing personas. I very much enjoyed the scenes with Miss Scattergoods (Geraldine McEwan), Janet (Ellen Degeneres), and Jennifer (Julianne Nicholson). Too bad these characters could not have had a film of their own.The twist at the end of the film was unique for mainstream cinema. That fact that Dreamworks made a film with that particular suprising twist is to be applauded."
1,So dull...,"I remember seeing the advertisement for this movie and couldn't wait to see it. I finally watched it last night and could not believe how slow and boring it turned out to be. I generally like movies that are slow and have very little action, but this was just too much. I guess my greatest disappointment came from the fact that it was such a good storyline and it was hard to believe that someone could do so little with it. I'd like to see another director take the same plot and develop it into a more interesting story. It just seemed that there was so much more that could have been done here."
1,One of the most boring movies ever made,Don't even go there. If ever a movie needed a car chase to liven things up this is it. Badly written and dull in the extreme. If you need a romance theme watch While You Were Sleeping again.
3,A nice sleeper,"What happens when people stumble across a nameless love letter? Given the fact that we all greatly desire love, we assume it was written to us. This is the premise of the movie that makes for an entertaining romp through a sleepy New England town.Cate Capshaw does a nice job as the towns most sought after single female who has chosen to ward off any of cupids arrows for fear of feeling its bittersweet sting. However, a tenderly written love letter, that appears mysteriously, does a wonderful job of stirring up those sweet longings for desire and romance. For each of the characters who inadvertently stumbes across this same letter, that thrilling sense of passion ignites their dreams as well.Played out something like a Shakesperian play, all kinds of mayhem ensues until the surprising truth is revealed at the end of this charming little film."
4,Quietly charming,"I found this movie, based on Catherine Scheine's novel, very enjoyable. I think maybe the people who gave it a bad review were expecting something different. It is more of a snapshot of different people's reaction to a situation and thoughts about love than a traditional love story. It is also more whimsical, like the book, than either serious or comic. I also rented it for the scenery; it was filmed in Rockport MA, a beautiful coastal town. The movie has a nice New England feel, and if you are from Massachusetts' North Shore, it's worth buying; you'll love watching the background. I usually find Ellen DeGeneres to be too over the top, but she was great in this film. Tom Selleck is also good, though his unkempt appearance is a little distracting. And Blythe Danner is excellent in her small role. Altogether a good adaptation of what Peter O'Toole would call 'a good yarn'."
1,I won't be sharing this book with the kiddos....,"What a horrible lesson in sharing. This book only teaches that it is okay to be selfish. I was shocked when I read this to the end, thankfully not to my little ones, and was sad to see it did not redeem itself. Definitely not a story about sharing...but rather a lesson in being self centered."
2,SHOCK HORROR!!!,"Oh MY lord! I was expecting a whole load of bad reviews on this cd, as it was DEFINATELY a bad cd! I mean ..apart from Liberty Bell, what the hell was nice? This slow crap, which is not heavy enough, and this long boring beat, while she goes on and on about noting in particular, I was VERY dissapointed with this album, I should NOT have got it. I mean it was way too light, and look at the cover, what on earth is this yellow stuff? I don't know, I'm not going completely put it down, her voice is still as enchanting as ever, and some of the ""ballads"" I guess you could call them pretty nice if you're snoozing and have nothing better to listen to, but I found this too peaceful and psychadelic for my liking, and many people said it was too commercial. I agree, please go back to what you were like during Mandylion The Gathering. Sorry to dampen the good reviews."
2,How To Measure A Planet?,"Extremely disappointing, to say the least! This album has it's moments, but they are few and far between, and not enough to balance out the extreme bordom this album creates. I love slow, quiet, melodic music, but with the condition that it's catchy and entertaining. This album is neither. I love Mandylion and Nighttime Birds, and listen to them both frequently, but I'm afraid How To Measure A Planet? will not be played nearly as often. This is a two star album; one star for Anneke's beautiful (but on this album, rather boring) voice and another star for the great talent of the others' (which they decided not to put to a lot of use on this album). I'm hoping If_Then_Else will proove that we all make mistakes, but they can be amended."
1,I'm sorry... we all make mistakes.,Mandylion and Nighttime Birds are two albums I really love (5 stars). Unfortunately in this album quantity has won over quality. The amazing voice of Anneke (I hate to say) can't capture my attention and at times begins to annoy me. It really lacks a song that stands out. When I hear this album I have a feeling that i'm hearing the same thing over and over again. This album has not made it to my car-stereo.
1,leave it or love it,"The Gathering seems to be one of those bands that you either love or hate. I hate it. I think it is not musical and certainly not subtle. Above that I have a problem with the voice of Anneke van Giersbergen. And besides that this is their worst cd. Sorry, that's what I think"
2,Where is the heavy guitar sound?,"I was very excited when I heard there was a new album of The Gathering and I immediately bought it. But hey, where is that typical heavy guitar sound that was on the two other albums? There are only a few songs that have that special The Gathering sound. Okay, the album sure sounds great and is well produced, but next time put more songs like 'Liberty Bell' on the album."
4,gathering are fantastic,"Only one song I thought rambled on way too long, and they had the sense to put it on the album as the last song on the 2nd cd. The rest of it I thought was great. The songs really stick in your head. I think that it is perhaps the cd of theirs which most ""sticks"" in my head. Although I might rate both Mandylion and Nighttime Birds slighty higher, this 2 cd set is right up there. More ""industrial"" or ""techno"" sounding than their last 2, but in a cool way, very spacey type sounds on this album."
4,Different than before!!,"This album is totally different than Mandylion and Nighttime Birds, but the lyrics are good and Anneke's voice hasn't changed. Which makes this album one of my favourites of this year, it's relaxing music but the lyrics will waken you!! Buy and enjoy is all I got to say!!"
3,"Good, but too much experimenting","This double CD album has several excellent songs on it but there's also a lot of experimentation that interferes with the music. It takes some time to find for yourself what you like and dislike. If you're a Gathering fan, beware that this album is extremely slow. I give this a middle rating. There are several hauntingly good songs but they're a minority on this 2 CD set."
4,"4,5 stars - A very good album",An amazing album . Lot of songs and especially the first cd its super. The songs are slow with very good production and the sound is magical . The vocals are for another time excellent and the sound of the guitars are great. I highly recommend this album to all people who would like to hear a quality music in the atmospheric metal scene. Its not so metal but its great.
5,4.5 Stars- One of Mansfield's Better Books,"I have read 4 books from this author so far and I think this is one of her best. At 21, the impetuous Miss Sophia has lived her with her grandmother, Lady Alicia, in London for several years now. She moved in with her since her mother's passing and can't stand to live with her step mother. At a ball, Miss Sophia hugs the Earl of Wynwood believing it is her cousin whom she hasn't seen in almost 11 years. He is rude to her and she ends up creating other mishaps in his presence increasing his dislike of her. She is invited to the earl's country estate since Lady Alicia is close friend's with his mother and Miss Sophia begins to make havoc there. I wont go into much detail into the cast and various incidents since I dont want to spoil the book.Story flowed nicely, entertaining cast and at times funny dialogue.I really hope they begin selling her books through kindle. I really enjoyed this clean regency romance."
1,Where are the songs?,"How can I review this album if I don't know what songs are on this album. There is no track list on the album's page. Please put the track titles on the Ramon Ayala pages. Many of them don't have the track lists. Without the list, it is very hard to choose wich album we would like to purchase."
2,Dropping the ball,"I'm not sure who was in charge of putting this dvd set together but I think they definately dropped the ball in the production of this season release. You wouldn't ever see Law and Order or Seinfeld release a ""Best of Season x"" dvd leaving out certain less popular or less watched episodes. I would have been perfectly happy paying a little more to get the rest of this dvd set. On top of that, the Negreanu/Lindgren Esfandiari/Laak commentairies accompanying the season 2 dvd set were a highlight and I think they ought to have expanded that to all the episodes.Overall, you get a dvd of 8 of the wpt episodes, half of the season, no commentary, no notable special features, and if you happened to be looking to replay your favorite episode you may be disappointed because the WPT didn't deem it on of the ""Best"" episodes.I hope this is the first and final truly second class product issued form the WPT."
3,WPT III,"I've read some good reviews and some vary bad reviews about this dvd.My opinion is that it is still better than watching it on t.v. Someone complained that there was some bad playing by some people,well thats poker! Its a four disk set with some of the better players in the world(at there best and worst). IF YOU like to watch poker get this dvd."
1,Boycotting World Poker Tour,"I stopped watching the World Poker Tour entirely. I only watched them in the first place because they put them on DVD, and since they screwed up season 3 by eliminating episodes, and then failed to release any subsequent seasons, I just don't watch anymore. It's a shame, because I'd like to continue watching every episode they've made so far. So now I watch poker videos or WSOP dvds to get my poker fix. I've practically forgotten about WPT.Saying the same thing about this screw-up as with the UFC, if you don't release everything, from the beginning, I refuse to watch. (UFC is still missing #1 and #2, both of which Hoyce Gracie won) So if WPT wants me as a paying watcher again, they will release ALL of season 3, and then begin releasing subsequent seasons.No wonder the stock is in the dumps, they have no idea what we want."
2,Too Small,"I was really expecting something big enough for my baby green cheek conure. This is small enough for finches and parakeets. This is not for ""medium to large birds"" as the product description said."
4,Good enough,"The knee pads were slightly asymmetrical, as though the cup had been riveted to the pad upside down on one of them. Other than that, everything was great. They did the job and they look really great with a layer of chrome silver spray paint."
4,They work.,"I have no prior experience with tactical pads but decided to order what turned out to be a great deal for only $15.The knee pads fit just fine and the elbow pads are barely big enough for my larger-than-average arms. Their construction seems durable, including cross-stitched bands. So far they have withstood a whole day of rough woodland airsofting. As for comfort and performance: When I wear them, it's practical to crouch, but I've found that they're a bit too rigid for duck-walking and they slip a little too much for extended low-crawling.All in all, I'm sold; they allow me to quickly and comfortably get into and stay into the most typical airsoft-related positions."
5,.,excelente producto de calidad recomendando como lo estaba buscando excelente servicio de envio a miami y recibido a tiempo estimado
3,Home Run!,"For the money I paid for these, I can't complain. Sure, there's more expensive ones that are better, but I'm cheap! They rub on the back of my thighs after a long while of wearing them, but they also allow me to baseball slide behind cover when I'm getting shot at. I love them!"
2,Below Average,"This product broke within 2 weeks of use. The ""forward"" button went out first and then it rattled like something broke on the inside. It no longer works at all. Disappointing product!"
2,hydra mp3 player,item broke within 2 weeks. returned for credit only. enjoyed it while it lasted. would have rather had an exchange.
5,Great summary,"This book is exactly what I wanted. It has an easy to read fluidity and thoroughness. I suggest, if you aren't going into church work to purchase the less expensive abridged version of this book, however called ""called to believe"", it should suit your needs. For all those who want to read a extensive introduction to Lutheran theology, you will find this to be golden. Dr. Steve Mueller is a phenomenal teacher, writer, and theologian this is yet another great piece of literature for any aspiring theologian. It is expensive but it is also well worth the money."
1,Never recieved,I never recieved the book! I have tried to email three times and have not been able to get the email through.
4,Another entertaining and intriguing mystery from Ms. Graham!,"I enjoy reading Heather Graham mystery novels. They have unique situations, characters and plots. There is humor and human interest and ""Dead on the Dance Floor"" is no exception. It was very interesting to enter the world of professional ballroom dancing and to meet various personalities as you might expect in the real world. Ms. Graham did a great job on research and making the story come to life. I enjoyed the character development on both primary and secondary characters in the book and wish there could be a sequel/follow-up book on them! A fun read and wonderful surprises!"
2,Couldn't even get through it.,"I have enjoyed some --but not all --of Heather Graham's works. Dead on the Dance Floor had a promising premise, especially since I'm a dancer myself. However, I couldn't even get through this one. I finally gave up. Graham often has too many minor characters in her books which muddle the story. This one had a lot of those with all of the teachers and dancers at the school. It was difficult keeping track of who was who."
5,Dancing Dead,I love Heather Graham. Everything she writes is very atmospheric as well as good character development. All of her creations are people you'd want to know.
2,Slow Dance,"Was very drawn out.....come on already and get to the point! There were some moments of suspense, but over all left me thinking, I wish this would end so I can read a book I will enjoy."
4,GREAT READ,I really enjoyed this book and the story moved fast. This is the first book that I read by this lady but I do agree with one reviewer about the pooper scooper stuff. That was a little much but I enjoyed all the other characters and the story. A really good murder mystery in the world of dance.
3,somewhat of a disappointment,"Many of the songs are relaxing & help me get to sleep - but there are other songs that change the mood & spoil my relaxed, sleepy feeling. The CDs just didn't work for me. However, I made an IPOD playlist with just the songs I found relaxing & sleep inducing - that does help me get to sleep & sleep more soundly. When I do fall asleep listening to this music, I find that, when I wake up, my breathing is slower & deeper."
4,Great Bedtime Sleep Aid,I love this CD. The music is so peaceful and does help you rest. It was money well spent. Good to play when winding down and getting ready to sleep. I can fall asleep listening to the songs.
2,Poor choice,The music was anything but relaxing. Some selections were actually irritating to the point of prohibiting sleep rather than promoting it. Donated it to the local charity store. A waste of money !!!
5,sleepyheads,This tape is played every night and puts me to sleep before the end is played. I would recommend it to anyone who needs to get to sleep
2,not too useful for sleep.,"It has some nice quiet music. However, it's inclusion of Greensleeves/""what child is this"" was a poor choice; it has this quiet music, followed by this sudden and loud ""den"", which always wakes me up. Very very annoying!"
3,"Relaxing, but not putting me to sleep",My mind just follows the music from beginning to end. High expectation that doesn't pay off.
2,Not what I expected.,"I should have paid attention to the two negative reviews. This CD doesn't put me to sleep at all--in fact, it keeps me awake. I find myself listening to the music instead of going to sleep.One of the pieces has irritating and dissonant passages mingled with relaxing, soothing passages. Also the music changes tempo and volume quite often, which would wake me up if I did start to drift off.Since I expected something that would put me to sleep, listening to this is upsetting, because I wasted my money.However, since it works well for most reviewers, I figure I must hear things differently, or have a harder time falling asleep than most. Maybe if I listened to it enough to get used to it, it might work better.I would like to find something totally soothing and relaxing--maybe I need actual recordings of water or rain, but I prefer music. Any suggestions?"
5,The Best Sleep Aid Ever!!,I have always had trouble falling asleep and have tried other sleep solutions but none have ever worked for me. A friend read about BEDTIME BEATS in MORE Magazine and suggested that I try it. I was skeptical but decided I might as well give it a go. To my surprise and delight BEDTIME BEATS worked! I have listened to the cd for 4 nights now. I have fallen asleep each night more easily and not only am I sleeping better but I have enjoyed the beautiful and peaceful music. I highly recommend Bedtime Beats to anyone who has had trouble sleeping!
2,misleading advertising,"Somehow, from the description of this album, I expected jazz to sleep by. What I got was very dull classical. So boring, it does NOT occupy my mind enough to distract me from cares of the day, so not a sleep tool for me."
3,Not all together,"The cross was beautiful and nicely boxed, however, we had to hot glue the wall hanger back on the cross because somewhere along the way, the original glue didn't hold it together."
2,Foldaway Desk - not so great,"This desk was almost impossible to assemble. I didn't even finish the drawers. THey had to be glued together and when I used the glue provide, they popped apart and the glue when it was squeezed then exploded.When I open up the desk it's not very sturdy and I am afraid it may just fall apart.The quality of the construction is very poor. I wouldn't advise anyone purchase this desk."
1,Nothing like color swatch at ALL.,"My hair was pretty light, and I put this on wanting the wonderful color on the box and swatch. NO!! It came out an ugly flat darkish brown, not even an appealing brown color, and I followed the directions 100% as directed by the pamphlet that came with the color. There was zero, and I mean ZERO hint of any color in this other than brown."
2,Does not work well on black hair.,"I even left this product in for 35 minutes and it only slightly lightened my dark hair. I was hesitant to use it because of the health hazards and the dryness I felt in the sample lock of hair I dyed; had it not been a gift, I would not have used it (did it for courtesy). The conditioner is wonderful, my hair feels great--but the color doesn't come close to measuring up to the model's hair."
1,Slowest shipper I have had so far...,if it doesn't ship soon I will write the worst rating I can on this one...So I suggest you change your systems to set a better example not a bad one...
1,Waste of time/money,I am disappointed. I would give a big fat zero if I could... My hair was faded light dull red (from avibrant red) and thought this would bring some shine/color into it without making it too bright. If anything it made my hair a darker brown with hints of red in the sun? I am upset. Thank god I only spent $4 bc it was in sale. Now to rush out and get my usual brand Feria Power Reds- lesson learned!
5,The best,"Revlon Colorsilk in Ultra Ash Blonde is my best kept secret. My hair is naturally medium brown, but this lifts it up to the lovely light blonde of my dreams... and it's only $3-5 per box! If your hair is long, like mine, you will need two boxes. I have tried more expensive products, but this is honestly the best there is. I have also tried Ultra Sun Blonde, which is a bit brighter and great for the summer. Colorsilk in Strawberry Blonde is great as well."
1,Did not change color of hair,"I just colored my light brown hair with this...carefully made sure it was evenly distributed, etc. I waited 25 minutes (probably a little longer) and washed it out, eagerly anticipating a head of coppery hair like on the box. Was I disappointed. You can't even tell that I colored my hair. It seems to have lightened it a half shade, other than that, NO RED/ORANGE color AT ALL. So angry. What a waste of time and money."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!,"This product states that it will take your hair, no matter how dark, to blonde, without any brassiness, which is not true. My hair was a dark brown and it turned out orange."
1,didn't work,"I am asian and my hair is naturally black and i've been using this brand from the Philippines and it works. but somehow, when i tried the US brand, it didn't work on me. maybe the problem is this color or asian hairs are thicker than american."
1,NOT AT ALL the color it showed,I followed the directions exactly. I figured it may be a little darker than the picture because my hair is dark brown. BUT my hair is NOT burgundy. It is more of a brown with a red cast. And not a pretty red cast either. I got it a LOT cheaper in a store. That is the only compliment I can give it. It is cheap and colours iike it is cheap. I will NEVER ever ever use this brand again. Or this color.I don't recommend this color or this brand frankly. If I had wanted brown hair I would have bought brown dye.
3,"RETURN YES, EXCHANGE NO","I ORDERED THESE SHOES AND FOUND THEM TO BE A NARROWER FIT THAN I EXPECTED. I WANTED TO REPLACE THEM WITH A WIDER SHOE, BUT WAS GOING TO BE CHARGED $75.00 FOR A REORDER."
2,different colors / different products,"I own a pair of the Allen Edmonds Eastport boat shoes in British Tan that I wear quite a bit and bought these brown AE Eastport boat shoes for variety and to alternate in with the British Tan pair. While they are the same size, same design and same quality soles and support, the uppers are made of much stiffer materials. Despite being EEE, for 6 months I had them in shoe trees wrapped with towels to widen them. Finally took them to a shoe shop and they were widened slightly over 3 days. Still don't wear them much since they are uncomfortable. I wonder if they were improperly labeled."
5,great casual shoe,"These keep going strong after alot of wear. The leather and quality stands up to anything that I can dish out. Bad weather, rain, sun, heat, sand, you name it and these pass with flying colors. They are a bit stiff at first. That is because they are good leather and strong construction. They feel great and are what you expect from Allen Edmonds. Made in North America does make a difference. Very happy with these shoes"
3,Pearl Jam - 'Alive Live' EP (Phantom Sound),"Ha! I've completely forgotten all about this four track CD single that Pearl Jam had released after their first album came out. Remember, that before Eddie Vedder and gang had started putting out live 2-CD recordings of virtually each and every one of their tour performances, us Pearl Jam fans HAD to rely on pieces like this to hear them play live. How DID we manage? ""Alive"", ""Even Flow"" and ""Wash"" are good to hear. Didn't care for ""Dirty Frank"" all that much. Aimed toward the completists."
5,Alive is simply the greatest Pearl Jam song ever written.,"""I'm still Alive"" is the simplest, yet most meaninful lyric written by Eddie, for it transcends all the misery and hardship that he has both experienced during his life and has now incorporated into Pearl Jam's music. Alive has an unbelievable instumental section with superb guitars and drums. Alive captivates the listener, making it Pearl Jam's greatest song ever."
3,Get It For Track 3,"As with all CD singles, get this one if you happen to be a Pearl Jam fanatic, looking for more stuff by the band. The first two tracks (ALIVE, ONCE) are taken from TEN. But it's Track 3, WASH, that is worth the purchase here. It's melodic, haunting and reminds one of other great PJ songs of this type like OCEANS, RELEASE and INDIFFERENCE. The lyrics flourish and Vedder's voice carries the mood of the song perfectly."
2,Disappointment,"Before the release of this album I was looking forward to it, as I am a fan of many of these artists who make up the compilation. After sampling every song, I have to say that I'm disappointed. Most of the songs sounded uninspired, and left me wishing I was hearing the original DC Talk version. The exception was 4th Avenue Jones' rendition of ""Jesus Freak"", that one sounded pretty good. In my opinion, Gotee Records missed the mark with this one, though I love most of their artists. I do recommend most of them, but doing their own stuff. 4th Avenue Jones, Paul Wright, Sarah Kelly, Relient K, John Reuben, and Fighting Instinct are all excellent. But I would advise steering clear of this cd."
4,A Valentine Gift for the Wife!,"My wife was in need of a larger chain for one of her precious pendants. She noticed what my sister had one and told me she just loved her chain. As a husband who rarely notices some else's jewelry I search the internet for a cut diamond chain since I did not have time to go the retailers. I ordered it and the shipping time was only about four days, not seven to ten days as advertised.The wife was elated and it was exactly what she wanted. I turned out to be a great Valentine's Day. She still brags about it."
4,Good fit for many silver pendants,I bought this chain to go with a silver pendant. The chain looked great with the pendant. However the metal weight is not as it described as 6.8g. It only weights about 3.8g.
1,This product was not any good.,"It took me a few days to open the package and check the memory. Outside it looked okay but when I put this memory stick into my computer, my computer would not boot. I put the original memory back in and it booted. So I do not recommend anyone to buy memory from this seller."
2,It's dumb,"I didn't like this movie because it's one of them that simply could have been a lot more, and you think maybe they're going to pull this stuff together... but no. It's just dumb. The acting is fine, etc., it's the story that is the problem. I see the good reviews here and can't help but think maybe I watched some other movie. Maybe it's just me... I don't know, but I certainly didn't like the movie, in fact I'd say it blows. Didn't ""hate it"" else I'd give it one star, but yeah, in my opinion, it blows... hard. Hmm, maybe I do hate it... bleh, I'll give it two stars anyway, just in case."
4,Pleased,I ordered this as a Christmas gift. My nephew was very excited and could tell not wait to get home and play.
5,Awesome,"Used these in the smaller filters, the impellers are all the same size, with just the blades being various sizes. I used these in a 30 and they pump water like crazy."
2,Chipped,"One of the blades is chipped. I ordered this impeller because even the vaseline wouldn't help the original impeller on the AquaClear filter I got. But like the original, one of the blades is a little chipped. I chose the filter because it received very good reviews. Maybe I got stuck with a lemon."
2,plastic blades are delicate,"I'm kind of unhappy that they make you buy the whole impeller, the plastic blades cost about 50 cents and snap on and off easily .... but I guess they don't sell the blades separately."
1,"Anything but ""Relaxed Fit""","Tried these in a 66 waist. Their characterization of these as ""Relaxed Fit"" is ridiculous. The waist was a 66 (I ordered larger to get a loose fit--my waist is really a 64) but the seat and thighs were nowhere near proper proportions for a person this large. It was as though I was trying to fit into a funnel that was overly wide at the waist and impossibly small at the knee. I'd recommend skipping this brand in larger sizes."
5,Great jeans,"Service from Amazon was, as usual, exemplary. These are really comfortable, well-fitting, and correctly sized, which can be a problem in today's market. Great price, also. Definitely recommend."
2,jeans,"nice jeans however the belt loops were to small, it would be nice if wrangler made the loops the same size."
3,"Rugged wear, alright.","Even after a couple of first washes, these jeans ride rough in the crotch. I've seen other ""working"" trousers for (real) men's sizes with a gussetted (paneled) crotch. I suppose that is would be appropriate for this application. But for the price, I'm sure I'll get my money's worth. I would have gladly paid more for Levis made in the US."
2,Jeans,Their the smallest 35's I have ever seen. They wouldn't fit my son at all and were very tight on my grandson that wears a 33.
1,Ripped in three months,I bought three pairs of these jeans for my husband and they have all ripped in only three months. All the rips start in the back pocket. Save your money and buy a brand that will last longer -- if you can find one.
5,Good Jeans,These are my second pair of these Wranglers. I wear these daily to work and they are very comfortable. I like the loose fitting feel to keep me comfortable during the long work day.
1,Not the size,"I purchased 3 of these jeans (34x32) and they are not 34 at all. I have other jeans and they fit perfectly, these one are too small. Very disappointed."
5,"The only pair of jeans I'll buy, period!","Various brands and styles of jeans fits people differently, and that's just the plain truth about the matter. For me, I've found that these jeans, in relaxed fit, are just what I like to wear. Matter of fact, I won't even look at other jeans anymore or anywhere else. I don't know what I'd do if Amazon quit carrying this product....go naked I guess."
5,excellent fit and durable,"Wranglers have always been my favourite jeans. The price here at Amazon is the best. Took a while to arrive, but the fit is perfect, they last, and are always my most comfortable pants. I'm sometimes tempted to be trendy and try a pair of ""designer"" jeans, but then I get into my old faithful wranglers, and that thought passes! I'm also a 38"" inseam, and these jeans are a TRUE 38"" It's great to have pants that fit correctly in the length!"
4,good deal,these are a good deal and saved me going to a store to buy them can't wait for summer so that I can fit into them
2,Poor Fit,"On me, they fit poorly when compared to the ""other"" big brand who makes lots of denim jeans. Tight in the wrong places where the others are looser fitting. No problems with the quality, just not a good fit for a mid sized round guy with short thick legs, lol."
5,Good Product,Love these jeans and always will. Been wearing these for over thirty years. I still wear a pair that I have had for over ten years. I highly recommend the Wrangler brand.
5,Wrangler Jeans are the fastest jeans this side of the Mississippi!,The reason I shopped for Wrangler jeans on Amazon is that it is really hard for me to find my size where I live. (Which is completely stupid because I live in a suburb of Los Angeles!) Perhaps I am not looking hard enough but with Amazon I don't need to spend a bunch of time looking for jeans.Knowing your size is really important if you don't want to end up getting very familair with your post office sending something back. However as a jeans shopper you should know that already.I love Wrangler quality and consistency. I hope they continue to keep up both! The jeans come exactly as I expect them to be and the best part is they get here super fast! I don't pay for expedited shipping but they still get to me in 3 days which is great!Thank you Wrangler and Amazon!Kris Orange
2,Simply too relaxed,"I usually never order jeans online and against my better judgement did so. If you dont really care about how your jeans sits on your body then you will find it fine, but the cut and fit was simply too relaxed for me. At the end of the day, leaves you looking sloppy."
3,disappointed,"We have been purchasing Wranglers for my husband for almost 40 years and have recently noticed a diminishing in the quality of the brand. The fabric seems to be wearing out pretty quickly with hard use. This had not been true in previous years. I don't know if the company has decided to cut corners or what, but they are not the sturdy jeans we had previously been able to purchase. They are good jeans, but don't stand up to hard wear as well as they used to."
4,MUY BUENO,"ME PARECE UN PRODUCTO MUY BUENO , LO RECOMIENDO . GRACIAS . ENVIO RELATIVAMENTE NORMAL . SIN PROBLEMAS . ."
2,They are OK,The material is a little thin for hard work. Good think I ware them around the house and not on the farm
2,Fake color,"I bought one jeans jacket, and was looking for a colour match pant. The colour did not match, and I was highly displeased. I would have returned it."
1,Wrangler NOT rugged,"The jeans fit well and looked nice when they first arrived. However, they have already fallen apart. I am very disappointed with this purchase. I picked up a pair of Levis and a pair of Kirkland (Costco) jeans all around the same time. I am not very happy with the expensive Levi jeans either but at least they aren't falling apart. The most comfortable of the 3 pairs is acutally the Kirkland brand which I got for under $10. I have worn them many more times than the Wrangler jeans and they are holding up just fine. I will NEVER buy another pair of Wrangler jeans."
2,Incorrect waist size,"Smaller than they should be -- I've ordered these exact brand, model and size at several other retailers in the past, with no issues. But even though the Amazon product showed the same information, including the same product numbers on the actual tags, their size is definitely not the same. I ordered the 40x38, but when I compare these to supposedly identical jeans purchased in the past, these Amazon ones are about 2-3 inches smaller at the waist.Other than that they are good jeans, but for online clothing sales it's imperative to carry accurate sizes since people can't try them on in advance..."
2,Brand New But Looks Old,I needed a new pair of Wranglers because all of my jeans were 4-5 years old - and looked it. I was shocked and disappointed to find that these Wranglers didn't have that new-blue look. They look like the 5 year old Wranglers that they were supposed to replace! Amazon's description didn't mention that these pants had a used look; I'll be returning them. I learned an important lesson: don't by clothes on-line.
3,Buenos,"Made in Mexico, the quality is according to the price, I found the size a little big but okay. recommend purchase"
1,This is why people don't like to shop for clothing online...,"I had ordered the Wrangler loose fit jeans of the same size last week, and LOVED them. I was looking for a replacement for Levi 550s and 569s, as they had turned to junk recently (easily ripped, shrank up in both directions). The loose fit Wranglers were a PERFECT fit. Not so with these. The exact same size in the relaxed fit was OK for length, but instead of a 38x32 (as on the sticker), I think it was about a 32x30. Never have I seen such a difference in sizing amongst the same manufacturer. Poor quality control; I'd lose my job immediately if I let product like this ship!"
1,"cheap-ass, poorly made","When I got it and tried it on, I discovered zipper sticks all the time ~ 1/2 way down, 3/4 way down, etc. That's the cheap part. Now, having worn it several times, I've discovered that the white pocket bulges out as a matter of course - but just on the right side. That's the poorly made part. Headed for the Salvation Army."
5,great jeans,I bought these jeans for my husband. They were a great price. The fit is wonderful and he loves them.
4,They serve well,"I bought more than one of these items because as soon as I got the first one I saw the good quality/price ratio, which I guess is the strong aspect of these jeans. I have not found anything bad in them!"
4,jeans,"The jeans are fine, the packaging for shipment was fine. Amazon did publish the retail price in this instance so that I knew what sort of discount I was getting. I have seen a trend with Amazon though where the item, even new, has the retail price deleted so that if their partner vendors are charging a premium, one doesn't immediately know it. I've curtailed buying from Amazon until I'm convinced they won't be doing this any more. They're only response to the issue was to tell me to return the item to the vendor which is a cost to me-time and money-might as well go to a brick and mortar store if I'm going to go through that inconvenience."
4,great jeans value for money,This item wrangler jeans it's really nice and very comfy for my husband he likes it and I think it's great jeans for casual wear or even for work! Not very expensive for a pair of jeans why pay so much for brand if we are comfy with what we think nice and looks good. Wrangler is a brand name that never disappear in this business.
5,They really are Rugged,I have worn these pants exclusively since receipt. They have been comfortable where regular fit weren't. The workmanship and materials are great.
4,my wrangler,"The length and waste is perfect, it is just a little wide but it was my choice the relaxed fit, the cloth is very good and also finishing."
2,Very disappointing.,"Wranglers have always been sized perfectly for me for years--buy them at Target, don't even bother to try them on, wash them, wear them. But the first time they were ordered from Amazon, the ""relaxed fit"" is so tight I have to do the old 80's trick of lying down on the bed to get them to button. The waist might stretch, but the hip pocket is so tight I can't get my wallet in/out without making a scene. I asked the gift giver for the Amazon return label, and she looked so offended I dropped the subject.I think Wranglers are great jeans-- if these were factory seconds I wish they had been marked--and priced--accordingly."
5,Wrangler Jeans,"Excellent, durable and very comfortable jeans and reasonably priced. I shall use this brand exclusively from now on.Nothing more needs to be said"
5,"Great Jeans , Good Value","I used to buy Levi's 550 relaxed fit jeans because they were an American company, but now they are no longer made in America. These Wrangler Rugged Wear jeans are similar fitting and looking as the Levi's 550 jeans and about half the price, and seem to be a better fabric than Levi's."
1,Disappointed in Size/Quality Control,"Disappointed. Size I ordered from Amazon is the size I always buy/wear from stores. The pair received, while marked as correct size ordered, were almost too small for me to even get on and zipped-up right out of the bag. I can't imagine how I would have gotten them on after a few washings/shrinking. They were made in Mexico, for whatever that is worth. I don't see the point in buying clothes online anymore if you cant trust accuracy of sizing, and if that isn't trustworthy, what can one conclude about quality of materials, workmanship, etc.?"
4,Same Jeans as in the stores but available in larger sizes,"Good quality product, but as more than three times the price. These jeans in a 42x32 can be bought at target for $16, but are only available in sizes up to 44"" waist. I required a 46x32. The shipping was a bit slow but the product was as advertised. The 4 stars is because the wrangler jeans are well made."
5,Pants are Pants and these are comfortable as can be.,It is always a chore to order pants as most companies don't have a standard size and one maker you'll need a larger size or longer length. These fix perfectly and are very comfortable.
5,FANTASTIC,"In this enthralling process, The Flecktone's Victor Wooten and the Dave Matthews Band's Carter Beauford, take you through the step by step process that they used in the studio to make the album, Yin Yang. Beauford's syncopated rhythms on the hihat are a perfect marriage with Wooten's percussive bass playing. It is great to see these two incredible performers strut their stuff together on camera. This video is well worth buying! Top Notch Material!!"
5,humminbird system link,system link cable is very easy to install and gps is now linked to both locators and it works great!
1,Difficult to follow.,"I read health and nutrition books for pleasure and this was one I could barely get through. It was translated and perhaps thats why it is so hard to follow. The book skips around and gives little solid information. Also,if you are looking for information on how to use chitosan as an aid to weight loss, you will NOT find any information here. The info. on weight loss is limited to a paragraph and sketchy at best. Maybe chitin-chitosan is a miracle but you will be hard pressed to understand why in this book."
3,"Good, but could be ...","... much better. Although a major Bruce fan, getting this one was a slight dissappointment. Only three songs (Roll of the Dice, Leap of Faith and 30 Days Out), although Leap was Live and 30 Days Out is an unreleased song. Still, all of this is from his Human Touch/Lucky Town work, not regarded as Bruce's finest, but still good. While a must have for a Springsteen collector and fanatic, the casual fan would like find the Japanese writing the most entertaining aspect of the work."
4,A distant treasure!,"This Japanese release is from the Lucky Town- Better Days/Human Touch releases of March 1992. While maligned by some long term Boss fans, this was a time that his songwriting was evolving and this single is a great example of that. The main reason I bought it was for ""Thirty Days Out"" which can only be found on this single. It is a great song and would have been perfect on a single album of the best songs from Human Touch and Lucky Town. It is also completes my mix tape of ""Bruce by the Numbers"" - 10th Avenue Freezeout; Two Hearts; She's the One; Does this Bus stop at 82nd street; Incident on 57th Street; Highway 29; Johnny 99; 4th of July (Sandy); Zero and Blind Terry; Linda let me be the one, Two faces, One Step Up and of course 4 You and Born 2 Run ;-)"
5,Simply a MUST for all WJ Enthusiasts!,"This delightful book, for which Oliver took the time to paginate references to the more generally accessible Library of America two-volume set of WJ's work, reaches out to a broad audience in the early 21st century. He touches on a number of interesting topics, including computers and Internet usage, TV shows like Beavis and Butthead and Star Trek, Richard Rorty's readings of WJ, work by Daniel Dennett, F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, and why George Santayana once called WJ a ""barbarian."""
4,Lucaffe Espresso Pods,"Trying out different brands of Espresso; Lucaffe is a good, strong and bold brew. I also like the packaging imagery."
3,Just OK,"I ordered these for my Krupps maker when Starbucks decided to stop making their pods in favor of their new Verismo system. Sorry Starbucks, I'm not buying it. These pods are just OK. They don't really fit well I guess bc if I look closely, I can see water dripping down the sides while it's brewing which then makes my shot weak. It's back to the drawing board for finding a suitable replacement."
5,being a GODLY Leader for your family #101,"I read this,the first time in 1997 after I first came to Faith in Christ, as it offered ""Real Advice"" on being a Christian Leader, and guarding my heart,mind & eyes for the glory of Christ!I recently bought this again for my son-in-lawPoint Man is in my permanent top 10 forever"
3,Kindle edition typos,Fantastic book on what real manhood is all about. I wish I had come across this book years ago. The section about spiritually bulimic and anorexic men hits the nail on the head about why many Christian men in our society are so ineffective and unused by the Almighty. My only issue is with the Kindle edition. It seems to have been converted with a very poor OCR program and it was not checked for accuracy. There are literally hundreds of OCR errors and misspellings. Please fix this and I'll give 5 stars. Thank you for such a tremendous book!
5,Great book,"It is a very good book, and I was enjoying in reading it, and learned a lot. I would highly recommended this book to all husbands and fathers."
5,Great Book,I highly recommend this book for any christian man who is looking for a guide to living the christian lifestyle. And if you are not religious this book gives you some good pointers on the man woman relationship as well as how you can interact with your children. Very inspiring book you will not be disappointed.
2,No scripture,"I read this book twice: once after going to a seminar conducted by the author, and the second time in preparation for leading my own men's study many years later. My recollection was that it was a powerful and helpful book, but I was greatly disappointed the second time around. On the second reading I realized that while the author trumpets God vision for men throughout the book, he doesn't back it up with Scripture. He just simply asserts Biblical truths (maybe?) without grounding you in God's word as a way to get there. By all means read it, if you are trying to understand Biblical manhood, but ask questions to yourself as you read, and supplement this book with your own studies of Scripture. You might want to go to somebody like Wayne Grudem to get fully grounded Scriptural answers on these topics."
4,Very good book for men,"Point Man by Steve Farrar is an excellent book aimed at helping men navigate parenthood, marriage, and spiritual fitness, amidst a culture increasingly rejecting biblical views of being a husband and father. In a direct and clear way, ""Point Man"" addresses what it really means to be a husband and father. Farrar describes his purpose: ""This is a book for men. It's a book for men that talks about *how* to become an effective leader in your home. After years of research and study, it's my conclusion that effective male leadership in the homes of America is going the way of the dinosaur."" He talks heart-to-heart to ""men who love their families, who care for their families, and who would die for their families."" The book is devoid of fluff, focusing on hard principles, real-world examples, and spiritual fitness. Definitely recommended for men serious about being the husband, father, and leader that God desires them to be."
3,Open Minded,"I am a women/mother reading this book. I am currently only 1/2 done with this book. My father in-law gave it to my husband....., his was not too thrilled to receive or read it. As a mother to two boys (16 & 12) and two daughters (7 year old twins). I am very intrigued by the book. If nothing else to understand why some folks beleive like they do. There are some great points in it....BUT, I do not beleive you have to be this ""strick"" or ""conservative"" to have a happy, healthy, family/marriage. Men and women need their time and space. Together, apart, alone. I do not beleive you should ""burn"" every ship in order to ""be good"". Common sense, accountablity and trust.....that is what matters. May beleive differently once I finish......"
2,OK advice wrapped in offensive glossy & stupid theory,"Some helpful practical tips on things like prayer, but you have to get past some awful drivel to get there. In the attempt to convince the fathers he's aiming at that they should invest more time and love on their kids (not a bad thing itself), he makes ridiculous and offensive dismissals, such as: mothers as irrelevant to parenting; any family structure other than nuclear as having only existed in the last generation - dismissing entire continents and ages; and any generation apart from the present one as unimportant.Like I say, you get past this and the macho allusions they're dressed in, and there's some OK advice. However there is also the pernicious subtext that, 'Don't worry if your son is greedy, materialistic and unGodly, just so long as he's straight, gets and stays married, holds down a decent job, and doesn't touch drugs, phew, you've won the war.'"
5,Find the Secrets of Manhood,"""What is a real man? This book gives a clear view of manhood. It helped me better understand my role as husband and father."""
5,A must have for ALL fathers...especially new ones!,"As the father of a 9 month old boy, I was going into ""Mental Anguish"" mode before I read Steve's book. How do I explain sex and when was one of the bigger questions I had. This and MUCH more is answered in simple plain steps. READ THIS BOOK!"
4,:) :) :),"I would recommend this book to people who love animals and care about saving them to construction. Yes I learned something. Fight for what you believe in and there will always be people who will support you. Roy's dad didn't believe Roy at first when he told him owls lived on the construction site, but when he did believe Roy, he supported him all the way. I really like this book and I will definitely read another book by Carl Hiaasen."
4,Will use in my class!,I read this book because the movie is coming out and I was sent some curriculum that I can use in my classroom. The book is cute and thoughtful. I donated it to our school library and bought copies for my students. I am looking forward to going through it as a class.
5,Dig A Burrow For HOOT,Roy is the new kid at school and the school bully picks on Roy. One day when Roy was riding the bus to school he saw a running boy. A couple of days later Roy finds out who is thhe running boy. The running boy is Roy's friend Beatrice's stepbrother. In the book people are making a pancake house.
5,Highly recommended for pre-teens.,"What a great way to introduce your child to the world of non-absolute ethics. When are the laws to be followed, and when do we listen to our hearts to know what to do? Hiassen brings his love for all things Florida and his off-beat characters into a perfectly acceptable and palatable young person's format.Bravo!"
5,AWSM BOOK,"This is a great book about a boy named Roy Eberhardt who sees a strange running boy outside a window while a school bully was 'attacking' him. He follows this boy and...well you have to read it to find out, but Im telling you, this is , like, the best book I've EVVVEEERRRR read!! BUY IT!!"
5,"Hoot, a great childrens book by Carl Hiaasen","Hoot, a childrens book by Carl Hiaasen is a book full of adventures that will keep a child's mind wanting to read. The tales of Roy, Beatrice and the Running Boy keep the book alive and exciting."
4,braVo!,"Well, it made me laugh-something that doesn't happen so often. It's nice 'cause you get to see the story from the perspective of a kid who has to put up with bullies>Roy<. The book also deals with learning how to stand up for what you believe in. Blimey, it's the kind of book that you can read over and over again without getting bored...It made me wanna try living in Florida..."
3,My 10 year old son really enjoyed this book . . .,". . . and he is not an avid reader. He turns his nose up to almost everything we suggest for him to read - or he gets through a chapter or two before quitting. Until Hoot, the only books he showed an interest in were the ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" series. But he zipped through this book, and said he really liked it. He now wants to rent the movie, so it must've really had an effect on him."
4,The best book I have read all year!!!,"This book is the best!! Why you ask? This is because of the author, characters, and.. romance. The author switched the point of views every chapter. So you have to pay attention. Also the charaters are very interseting. There isn't anything horrible, just crushes. This boy and girl is what the whole stroy is about. The boy has brilliant blue eyes, that the gorl, I might add, loves! Unfortunatly the boy doesn't like her one bit, not even as a friend! In the end with a little jelously, and a planting of a tree, the boy ends up likeing the girl! It only took a few years! The only thing that I didn't like about the boook is that the auther didn't make it clear if they would date or not."
3,HOOT,My book for my review was called Hoot. Hoot is about a boy named Roy . Roy is the main character in the story. The author's name is Carl Hiaasen. I would recommend this book to girls because I have know some boy who have read this book and did not like it. Hoot is my favorite book. I have read it 7 times! I think this book is best for girls. From ages 9 to 12 it is more of a kid book than an adult book.
3,An OK book,"Not the most compelling read. The ending -- the protest scene --especially when a protester started singing ""This Land Is Your Land"" -- was a little too cheesey for me. Also, the moral of the story is kind of simplistic. Not much analysis on the true dilemma of environmental policy -- the difficult balance between environmental interests and economic interests."
3,This Did Not Deserve The Wonderful Award It Got,"I'm sorry, Mr. Hiaasen, but I did not enjoy this book. I just wanted it to end! It was OK, with some good parts. However, this would not be on my ""Best Kid's Books"" list by any means.The main character's name is Roy. He has just moved. He is not happy about it. ""Disney world is an armpit,"" he says, ""compared to Montana."" But finally something starts to get interesting. He spots a barefooted boy running, running fast. This leads to a mystery- a mystery about some big dogs, pancakes, slippery fish, a girl from school, some sneaky lies, a bully with a fear of alligators, and some tiny owls in huge trouble.Not a bad book, but I would not recommend it."
2,not so great,it was ok at the beginning but got boring. i quickly got board and put it down. i finished it and thought it was awaste of time to read it.
3,Hoot on Audio CD,"I'll let you read other reviews to decide if you want to try the book. This review is specifically in reference to the audio book, which is read by actor Chad Lowe. My daughters and I listen to audio books daily, and we've listened to some truly gifted readers. The trouble with Hoot is that Chad Lowe reads with the skill that I expect from a non-professional. He brings absolutely nothing extra to the performance of the book. Very disappointing."
1,Damaged Item Sold as Good Quality,This book-on-tape was damaged when I received it. The tape does not work properly -- it slows down and is not useable.
1,Kindle price still wrong,"Love Carla Hiassen and now passing that on to my child. But I won't buy a Kindle book for the same or more than a paperback. So, I checked it out of the library, Stand with us and refuse to give in to publisher price gouging. Consuners should get a reasonable discount for ebooks!"
4,"Wry, Quirky Literature","I have to say that this is one of the best books I have read in awhile. I couldn't help but think of the book Holes as I read this one. Especially when it all comes together.This is a wonderfully quirky story about a quick witted middle schooler named Roy Ebherhardt. Roy, the classic new kid in town, has his life changed one day on the school bus. That fateful day as Roy is being bullyed on the bus he glimpses a strange barefooted boy running beside the bus.From that day forward Roy is swept into a slowly unraveling mystery with these elements: a runaway nature lover, a brutish female soccer player, a pancake house, a mullet catcher and those owls! (There are no owls...) :-)This tale is expertly rendered... it comes to fruition slowly and deliberately... but oh what a pay-off!Hiaasen uses much humor and wry saracasm in his story telling. I had quite a few out loud laughs and that is a great thing. This book is highly entertaining and engrossing.I highly recommend it!"
4,Hoot's a Hoot,The beginning of the book may be difficult for young readers to understand since there are two stories going on. However the book includes a lot of life lessons for children to learn. Children will be able to relate to the events in the book. Most children will enjoy reading the book.
3,Hoot by Carl Hiassen,"I enjoy Carl Hiassen,I have at least 1 copy of all his books.""Lucky You"" is my favorite and the standard I use to measureothers.He always gets his ecological point across and with""Hoot"", I received more save the ecosystem than humor.I will,of course,continue to read anything he writes."
4,Who gives a Hoot about hoot i do,"The story hoot is about a young boy named Roy.Roy has to move alot and because his fathre works for the justice system and must travel alot, but Roy must go with him so they go from state to state renting house to house. Roy was born in Detroit but spent alot of growing up in Montana this was his favorie place. So then they move to Florida they like it but Roy hates it there.Roy goes to middle school and takes the bus but he gets bullied by the smoking Dana Matherson.So one day Roy see a running boy and not much older then him wering a dirty Miami heat jersy and dirty caky pants and blonde hair. So every day he looks for the kid and one sunny friday he see him then goes after him but ends up getting hit in the head with a golfball when he ran across the course.Then later he finds out that a local Pancake house is being being built and that there are tiny owls and they must stop them from destroing the owls homes underground."
3,HOOT,My book for my review was called Hooot. Hoot is about a boy named Roy . Roy is the main characterin the story. The authers name is Carl Hiaasen I would recamend this book to girls because I have know some boy who have reed this book and did not like it. Hoot is my favorite book. I have read it 7 time! I thik this book is best for girls. From ages 9 to 12 it is more of a kid book than an adult book.
5,Read this book--its good!,"Roy Eberhart, Mullet Fingers, and Beatrice Leep are trying to save little baby owls and their existence from Mother Paula's all American Pancake House, Inc. They do a series of stuff to the construction site so they couldn't build the pancake house in Coconut Cove, Florida. Mother Paula's knows they are there, but they want the pancake house anyway. I recommend this to kids who like fiction and who are very adventurous people.I liked this book because its got action, and I like action books."
5,The best book i'v ever read,Hoot was such a good book i got my whole family Reading it and they where just amazed and we send our thanks to carl for giving us the delightful moments
5,Favorite,"Another favorite for the specail young boy in my life! Adventure, excitement and laughter - LOVE CARL HIAASEN! Can't really go wrong with his stories for young people - or adults!"
4,Great Book!,"This book is a wonderful childrens book, and I love the character Mullet Fingers! He is such an amazing person!"
4,Great,This book was amazing!! I read some of Carl Hiaasen`s other books but this one was the best one I have ever read!!!
4,Hoot for Owls!,"I think you will love Hoot.This book is about how a boy named Roy Eberhart and his friends saved burrowing owls.I liked this book because it was funny and entertaining.I thought the characters were interesting, but I did not like that it was suspenseful.This book also made me want to save the owls.I thought it was a spectacular book, and I think you should read it, too!"
3,"Good book, but overrated","I tired of the book around (well really before) p. 180. The back and forth between the storylines of Roy and what the police officers are doing on the job site gets tiresome. For me, the mystery of what's going on takes far to long to develop and tries the reader's attention. On the positive, Hiaasen does a fine job of articulating the nuanced and sophisticated emotions and thinking of preteens.Overall, I thought the storyline was too over-the-top and strained credulity. Hiaasen seems to be a clever writer trapped in a minimal plot in this book, and i didn't find the book humorous as many claim."
4,Hoot-O-Rama,"The book Hoot was superb because it has great characters,it has an awesomely fantastic story line, and because it is very interesting.The characters were somewhat normal but there were some abnormal people.The story line was great. It always kept you wanting to read the book! It was sad, happy, and joyful.I would say this book is good for anyone, child or adult. This was a wonderful book."
3,Just get to the point,"In the book, hoot, it was different then all of the other books that I normally read. It took about 100 pages just to pretty much start talking about the owls, which is about 1/4 of the whole book. I would suggest this book, but If you like to get straight to the point, its probably not a very good book for you."
3,Ok,This book is an ok book but wasn't my favorite book. If you like books about saving animals and mysteries this book is for you.
2,Not impressed,"I always like to read books before buying it for my children. I'm glad I read this ahead of time because I didn't agree that it should have gotten any award by any means. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a strong environmental message. But that wasn't the problem with me; instead it was the LANGUAGE. Do 5th graders really need to be reading expressions like ""dumb-a$$"" and other profane words in their books? This is recommended for 5th graders but I wish the author kept his audience in mind when writing a book for elementary-age children."
3,It is what it is,"Being a big fan of Jimmy Buffett, I wanted to read Carl Hiaasen's ""Hoot"" prior to the release of the movie Jimmy is producing for it. It is a quick read and I enjoyed it for what it is; however, I found that it was missing the ""Aha"" moment that most all Newberry award winners have. I would have probably enjoyed it more if I hadn't seen the Newberry seal on the cover, because my expectations wouldn't have been so high. That being said I think it will translate well into a movie."
5,HOOT,This book is a million times better then the movie. I advise this to kids from the thrid grade and up. It is a great story of a Montana boy who moves to south Florida and meets a nasty bully. It is one of the best novels I have ever read. If you might be intrigued by th sounds of this book defenatly get the sample first. I got the sample first and fell in love within the first two pages. If you love a good action packed novel get this book. Hopefully this was helpful to you thanks for reading :D
3,"My ""Hoot"" Review","The book ""Hoot"" is an interesting, lighthearted, slow moving story. The book focuses on Roy, a very dynamic character, who has just moved to Florida. One day, when going to school, he sees a boy running into the woods and he is very curious. He gets caught up with this boy who has a plan to save local owls. These owls would be killed by a new construction project in town. He then protests against the workers, and gets in mischief. Sometimes the book can get exciting and intense. One part said ""He clenched his right fist and brought it up blindly over his shoulder, as hard as he could right into Dana's face"".This is just one of the problems in this book. I would recommend this book to people who enjoy reading about animals and action. This book is overall a pretty good book to anybody who enjoys reading."
3,Hoot,"This book I read was Hoot by Carl Hiaasen I'm going to tell you a little about it.This boy names Roy finds himself getting beat up on the bus when he looks out the window he sees this kid running. Roy was wondering what he was doing. Roy keeps on watching the boy but he just keeps running and running. Roy watches until he can't see him anymore. So Roy just sat there wondering, does he go to my school? So Roy asked Dana if the boy they saw running goes to our school? You'll have to read the book to find out the answer. Because it has lots of detail. I think you should read this book because it was great and you learn a lot."
3,"Thick on message, thin on story.","Hoot by Carl HiaasenAn overly long, but well-written (style, challenging and modern vocabulary) story of a kid, Roy, newly arrived in Florida, and his friendship with bully Beatrice and her step-brother Mullet Fingers. The themes of Capitalism vs. the environment, along with a good touch of civil disobedience, are appropriate and perfect themes for young teenagers' (with those beautifully over-developed senses of justice and righteousness). It has a great message: you can believe in something, you have the power to do something about the problems in this world. Unfortunately, great themes can't really hold a book together that has flat characters and a thin plot. Grade: B-"
4,Hoot Hoot Hoot,"I think this is an amazing book. It had many twists and different characters. All the characters had there own unique personalities. Like Mullet Fingers who was always thinking up his next scheme, and Beatrice who had a mean side but was also very caring too. Hoot was definitely a page-turner that kept you guessing. Some of the pages ended in cliff hangers that definitely made you turn the page. I'd recommend Hoot to both boys and girls."
4,Stop the Construction!!!!,"This book was a great book! Roy, is a boy who has just moved from Montana. He is starting at a new school and is dealing with a bully. Dana Matherson is a bully who is big, strong, and mean. In this book Roy meets two people who are looking for help, to save the owls! Construction on an empty lot, where many small owls live on, is beginning. This book has great detail, plot, and is really interesting. If someone needed another good book to read, my first suggestion would be this book named, HOOT!!!"
5,read this book,really good book got to read again and over and over and over.IT has some swers in it but there not that bad.
4,Hoot is a fun book about a boy's experiences in a new place.,Hoot was a really fun and creative book about a new boy who just moved to Florida. He has a lot of crazy new experiences. Meeting new people and seeing new things. His first odd experience is meeting the school bully and on the way he sees a very strange boy running outside. This was the first of a long sring of odd experiences in Florida. This boy was my favorite character in the book. He is very free spirited and he enjoys himself. He is a very believable character. I had a lot of fun with this book and I would recomend it to any young adult who likes books that keep you interested and show you a good time.
5,117th best book ever [its a joke],"1. Hoot is a wonderful book. Hoot has a big effect on readers and will teach them a lot more about environmental issues. It all starts when a young teen, Roy Eberhardt, moves to a small town called Coconut Cove and sees a mysterious running boy. That's when the adventure begins. The character development happens fast. You will soon come to learn the full personality of everybody and what they're probably going to do in tough situations. I recommend this book for people around age 6-50.BY MAX"
4,Owl Pancakes,"I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone who would like a good read. My eyes were glued to this book, it was exciting and fun, but you never know what was going to happen next. This book also captivates a young audience; I would recommend it to anyone ages 11-14. It also had so many surprises in it. You could read it casually and then all of the sudden your eyes would widen with thrill. I also loved Carl Hiaasen's style of writing. It really draws you in, because he uses realistic language that thirteen year old actually use today. Not to mention the plot was also realistic, and could happen in everyday life. I would also unquestionably recommend his next book, Flush, to anyone out there. This New York Times Bestseller is certainly worth the trip to the library."
2,TITO'S REVIEW,I thought that Hoot wasn't the best book that I've ever read. The story was about a boy who tried to stop a pancake house from going up because of a rare owl. They would have to kill the owl to put it up. So there is someone vandalizing and Roy tries to find out who it is. Then there is another story about a construction worker trying to stop the vandalism. I thought the story didn't really have point. So thats my review for the book
2,Dominique's Hoot,"My favorite part in the story HOOT was when Roy was getting choked by Dana Matherson in school and Roy punched Dana somewhere moist and rubbery.Dominique Brown Woodbridge,VA 22193"
2,Vandalism Rewarded!,"Maybe I'm out of the loop here, but since when is it appropriate to teach children that breaking the law, in this case vandalism, is proper behavior. Maybe that's what's wrong with our society today. It seems, in speaking with other librarians and booksellers, that I'm the only one who had a problem with this book in that respect. What happened to the old adage: Two wrongs don't make a right???"
1,Dont read it,Dont read Hoot. Hoot is one of the most boring books I have ever read. Its about a guy who becomes best friends with a weirdo and he trys to save burrowing owls from loosing there homes. It shoulnt of got the newbery honor book award. Dont read Hoot.
1,Poor role models!,"This book is terrible. The first time the owls are mentioned you know where the whole story is going. There are no characters with good qualitites. Main character lies to everyone and frames a kid who gets arrested. But that's okay. The boy who gets arrested already has a record so he would probably end up in juvie anyway. We learn that from a school counselor who tells her son, who promises not to tell but does. The story involves verbally and physically abusive parents as if this is common and less of a concern than owls. There is an instance of swearing. Also one kid moons another. I wish the author had just written a sign saying ""Save the Owls"" and saved me a lot of time."
3,so far,"I've read three books this summer. My grandmother is paying me a dollar for every book I read so I'm not bragging. The first two weren't like work at all, but this one almost is. I thought it would be more adventerous. That's the kind of book I really like. For everybody who likes more adventer, adventuer / \ excitment, I think they should read The Misadventures of Maude March, and if they are a boy, they will like The Voyage of the Frog."
5,Best book ever,"Fiona's ReviewThis book takes place in Cocoanut cove,Florida with a boy named Roy .and his adventures.Roy just moved to Florida for his dad's work. He goes to Trace Middle school and get's bullied on the bus by Dana Matherson. But if Dana hadn't smashed his face against the window he wouldn't have seen the running boy. The running boy is Beatrice the bear's brother. Beatrice the bear is a enemy at first but really just want's to help her brother and Roy. But when a big event for Mother Paulas all american pancake house is coming up Roy ,Beatrice and Beatrice's brother team up yo save the owls.I liked this book because of the funny things the characters say and do. Also I think the book was very mysterious and a little bit scary but that kept me engaged really well. A lot of the time the author surprised me but in a good way,about how the characters acted.I recommend this book to people who care about animals and people who stand up in what they believe in and care about."
3,Perfect for a Student,"Hoot is not the best book that I have ever read, but it is quite good. I feel that because it relates to teen problems that it is a book geared more towards teenagers than adults. The plot of the book kept me interested enough to continue reading. The main character kept surprising me with his actions, especially for how young he is. He is truly a responsible person from the beginning of the story. Even though he moved a lot he is still strong and quite good at adjusting to new environments. Overall I found this book to be a good read, but I would not read it a second time. I give it 3.5 stars out of 5 and I would recommend this Book to students, especially students who do not like to read big books."
4,Hoot!,"Hoot is typical Hiaasen faire of twisted humor, mystery, and not-so-hidden messages. The Florida adventure starts when on his way to school, Roy Eberhardt sees a shoeless boy running down the street. Curious why the boy is not going to school, Roy decides to find out who he is. The new kid Roy and the shoeless truant joins together on a secret mission-saving a family of endangered burrowing owls from being destroyed by the construction of a pancake restaurant on the lot where their home is located. Transplanted Montanian Roy is thrust into a world of capitalistic adults, limelight-loving politicians, school bullies,child abuse, and civil disobedience. Filled with humor, it also touches on the realities of child abuse and destruction of wildlife habitats. The manipulation of the bully was masterful, but you can't help feeling sorry for him in the end. Watch out for those alligators in the porta-potties! Recommended for ages 10 to 15 years old."
5,Hoot,"I thought that Hoot was a great book. It was funny, interesting, and it had a good lesson. The book's lesson, to me, was always fight for what you believe in. It also made me think of the fact that even though you're a kid, it doesn't mean that you can't make a difference. I loved Hoot and hope you do, too!!!"
2,Kids Book??,This was the first book of Hiaasen's that I have read and I didn't know it was a kid's book. I picked it at random. Don't know if I should read another one by this author or not. The writing was pretty plain and predictable.
3,Hoot,Hoot was a good book it tells a story of a boy named roy his friend beitrice and her step brother try to save some baby burrowing owls that live on the site of the knew bui;ding site of mother paulas all american pancake house. In the end of the story the goal is acheived and the owls are saved
2,I wasn't particularly impressed,"""Hoot"" could have been a really fine story of a boy's coming of age, facing an obstacle that pits life's lesson against life's lesson, right against wrong, moral against legal. As it turned out, Hiaasen just didn't carry his vehicle particularly deftly. The characters are paper-thin: frankly, we just don't give a HOOT about them. Roy is dull and predictable; the police are run-of-the-mill buffoons; and, as for the mysterious, barefooted Mullet Fingers, I couldn't care whether he lacerated both plantae on one of those new onion slicer gadgets. I wish I had taken a ""pass"" rather than invested three hundred pages in this trivium."
1,Hoot Flew too far to the left for me,"This book was funny at first, but it got too politically correct for me. There is a definite left-wing, socialist message in this book--that government--and government regulations--are good and are there to save us from the big bad corporations. (All the people who work the restaurant chain are stereotypical, cardboard villains; in contrast, the main character's likeable father works for the federal government.) Some may say that you shouldn't take this book too seriously--that it's just a ""comedy."" But it gets pretty serious as it goes along, and I think we should be teaching our kids to like businesses, because they create jobs, and to hate government regulations because they choke small business and risk taking and stifle job growth. Most people fail to realize that most fast food restaurants are franchises run by risk-taking entrepreneurs, not by greedy executives in some corporate headquarters."
2,Be mindful of swear words/political agenda,"My 9-year-old brought this home from the school library and upon reading it, informed me the word ""damn"" is used multiple times in the book. While it's not the most horrible thing in the world, I guess, teachers and parents should be aware it's in there. I'm puzzled as to why a children's book, and one that's apparently won awards, has swear words in it. Also, the synopsis on the book jacket described the story of a boy who moves to a new school and finds an unusual person to be friends with. However, my son told me the main points of the story were environmentalist in nature, coming out against a company developing land in Florida. While that kind of thing is something that should be discussed, I wish the synopsis had been more truthful. It's disappointing to see that there's some deception on the story description and then includes swear words once you get into it. Full disclosure is a good thing."
5,Get a hoot out of Hoot. By SpiritMoon11,"I LOVED this book!Focusing on real environmental issues,Carl Hiassen deserves a 10 stars!This is my favorite book! Keep on writing Carl!"
5,hooterific,"Hoot is about two boys and a girl. The two boy's are the Running Boy and Roy Eberhart. The girl is Beatrice Leep. They all try to save endangered owls from the Mother Paula construction bulldozers. Roy moves a lot because his dad works with justice department. I am like Roy because my dad works in the Coast Guard. Roy and his family moved from Detroit to the mountains in Montana. Now he lives in Coconut Cove, Florida. I rate this adventure as my number 1 book of all time, and I have read a lot of good books. Carl Hiaasen gets the message out real well. This is a very humorous and phenomenal book. I recommend this book to young adults and kids. I also recommend this to people who like adventurous books."
4,Hoot,"I recommend this book to people who really like comedies. When I started to read I never wanted to stop. This is the best book I have ever read. I loved this book so much I could read it 40 more times. I love comedies so if you have the same personality I think you should read a funny, good, humorous, and spectacular book like Hoot."
3,hoot,By Eric November 17/2005The name of the book is HOOT and the author is Carl HiaasenThis book earned the Newberry Honor award and the number ofPages are292 pages long it is a good long read it didn't take thatLong to read it took me a week and a day to read it. It is kind ofA easy read to me might not to you people but is to meThe characters are officer Delinko and Roy two of the mostImportant characters in the bookAnd in I am going to give you brief summary about the storyThere is a boy that always runs after the bus but he never gets on whenThe bus stops then the bus leaves but you have to find out the mystery of the boy that doesn't get on the bus. I would call this book a mystery because you don't know what is going to happen next in the next page in the book I would compare this book this didn't remind me of any other book I read this book kind of makes me feel like I am in the book in some parts only other wise I would like to read those parts again...
4,"HOOT IS A ""HOOT""","This book is stuffed with adventure and a whole bunch of fun. With suspense that never stops, you will never want to put this book down. This book never got boring and always seemed exciting. I think the book Hoot is the right choice for you."
3,Hoot by Carl Hiassen,"The book Hoot by Carl Hiassen tells you about a boy named Roy who is the new kid in town again. My favorite part in the book is when Roy gets into a fight with Dana the school bully and Roy wins. The part I didn't like was when Dana wouldn't stop trying to hurt Roy. I gave this book a 3 out of 5 star rating. I would recommend this book to young kids because is funny, adventures, if you break the law you get into big trouble, and it shows bully's get into big trouble and that its not right."
3,It was an ok book.,"The book was definitely not the best book I have ever read in my life. I only enjoyed parts of it. I thought it was very confusing. I was about to give the book 2 stars, but I decided to be nice. I liked the parts where Roy kept seeing the poor kid on the bus, then followed him. It was just fine."
1,Use of 'poor' language in a book for ten year olds!,"I gave this book to my 10 year old and within the first five pages, she came accross the 'd' word in the text. I quote from page 4, ""They yanked em' out of the ground, every d#@* one of them."" It is used by a construction worker who is talking to a police man but regardless, it is unnecessary. Although I am well award my child has heard it as well as other words,I don't believe it should be used by a children's author who is writing for 10 year olds."
2,Disappointed,"As a fan of Hiaasen's adult fiction and an environmentalist, I couldn't wait to read this book with my kids. What a disappointment. Sure, there's a story there, about a boy who stands up against the illegal destruction of a protected species - but the author seems to have replaced the outrageous humor of his other stories with tons of explanation and repetition, as if he's making sure kids might understand. Try reading ""Notes from a Liar and Her Dog"", or ""The House of the Scorpion"", or ""Holes"", instead."
1,Awful! Awful! Awful!,"This book proves that awards are given to authors, not books. I cannot imagine one of the middle school students that I have ever taught in my eight years enjoying this book. It is long, dull, and preachy. The characters and conflicts are unrealistic. If I had not been forced to read it for our adolescent book club, I would have abandoned it after page 3.Don't fall prey to the flashy colors on the cute cover. Just don't waste your time."
1,Mom's review,"Hoot has language problems for an elementary-age book. And the subject matter is filled with EPA rhetoric. Stay clear.I'm just glad I read this before I let my 5th grader read this junk. As I write this, I'm only 1/2 way through but will finish...even if it bores me to death. Don't waste your money. And save some trees by not buying this book."
2,No more biting humor.,"Though written for a younger audience, (and nowhere was this evident when I bought it), Carl Hiaasen's newest fiction dispenses with the outrageously funny characters that first brought him to the attention of National Public Radio and thus to me: the former governor of Florida who now lived on roadkill and dashed into highway traffic in a bright yellow slicker to retrieve his dinner or the towering former biker bar bouncer who lost an arm to a barracuda and now sported an implanted weed wacker in its place.His passion for the disappearing Florida flora and fauna is still the underlying subject of this book, but without the vividly drawn characters, this is populated with two-dimensional figures in a Carl Hiaasen-meets -the -Hardy Boys novel."
2,Carl needs to stick to the grown-ups,"I love Hiaasen's fiction. I was excited to know he was coming out with a book aimed at a younger audience so I could share him with my 12 year old, Sam not being quite ready for the likes of ""Tourist Season"". He and I read it together. Half way through he was begging me to put it down and start another book. I kept telling him we needed to keep going since I knew there would be a hilarious ending. Well, there wasn't. The book was boring, and the attempts at the Hiaasen humor didn't translate to this level of readership. The characters were not nearly as colorful as in his adult books. Bottom line-it just wasn't funny."
1,Hoot - a study in ecological terrorism and vandalism,"What an offensive book depicting ecological terrorism and crime masquerading as righteous activities by children! ELF (listed by the FBI as an American terrorist organization accused of vandalizing millions of dollars worth of private property) would be proud. In the book, parents are clueless but well-meaning, school officials are inept, corporations are greedy and employees stupid, politicans are corrupt, and vandalism to property is condoned, all depicted through the eyes, of course, of an innocent child. This book does not belong on anybody's reading list - unless, of course, you belong to that part of the population who thinks capitalism, private property and profits are dirty words."
1,Worst Book Ever,:[ Hoot was a blad and pathetic story about a book named Roy. Do Not Read it will save you the horror. Read other books like Warrior Cats.
4,"Give a Hoot for ""Hoot""","Carl Hiaasen wrote a fun-filled kid's novel that takes place in Coconut Cove Florida. This is a story of a new kid, Roy Eberhart, from Montana fights the battle of bullies and the lives of burrowing owls. While he solves the mystery of the ""running boy"" ,he learns who he really is and gains a great friendship with him and Beatrice. While helping the running boy in his task of stopping the Mother Paula's Pancake house from burying the owl holes, Roy faces conflicts and delays. Not only is officer Delinko constantly on this case ,Roy also used his name in the hospital to help a friend while he was hurt. Will Roy and his friends ever stop the bulldozers? Find out, and read this great book."
3,"hoot says the owl, it time to read the book.","Hoot, is a book based on a boy trying to save the owls. Down in Cocunut Cove, Florida, where he just moved Roy Eberhardt longs for Montana. Bully Dana Matherson,and the running boy keep him on guard instead of daydreaming for the mountains. When Roy encounters the running boy and finds out about the Burrowing owls his life in Florida takes a turn. Trying to save owls from a mean pancake company, and escaping Dana keeps him busy. But when time almost runs out, Roy has to take matters into his own hands before its to late."
2,Honestly?,"Hoot is an exceptional book with a respectable message. While I was reading it I was thinking it's okay, that's interesting, hmmm, aha, oh, ect. But what I never thought was wow!, cool, haha, weird, oh no! and so on. I felt like the author lacked passion, the comedy was juvenile, and the drama unrealistic. When I was done reading I was actually a little relieved it was over! That has never happened to me before. So read the book if you are a great Hiaasen fan, or 8 and under, but otherwise set the book down; walk away with your hands raised; and forget about the whole crazy idea of reading it. Cause honestly, it just ain't too special."
4,Nat's Neat Review,"Hoot is a humorous and witty story about a young boy named Roy who moves to Florida and believes that nothing exciting ever happens there besides getting beat up by the middle school bullies. Roy finds himself helping his new friends vandalize a restaurant property for the sake of saving the burrowing owls living under ground there, which would soon be plowed when the building started. He is a brave boy who becomes happy to make friends and for being of help to the environment. Hoot is a perfect book for anyone looking for a silly story that has a hysterical plot, and will leave them laughing out loud."
2,A kid's book?,I already don't like language that is not appropriate for adults to speak and so much more when a child speaks obsenities. I bought this book for my children after watching the movie. It was very disappointing as far as having to listen to foul language. We would have liked it without it!
1,The end of footnotes,"I am giving this book a large raspberry not because of its content but because of its editors. The Economic Consequences of the Peace is a classic and should be read by everyone. Unfortunately at least the print edition of this book with the introduction by Volker has a very nasty habit. Rather than carrying over the foot notes to the next page if it lacks the room, it simply truncates them. In one notable case it truncated a foot note in the middle of a hyphenated word. There is no reason in the world why editors should be so sloppy on such a matter. The footnotes are part of Keynes's work, they are important. Find a different edition to read if you really want to read one. This one rots."
3,Kindel Edition lack formatting,"I note that this Kindle edition has all the text, but none of the formatting. It does not have an active table of contents.A much nicer version is available from Gutenberg - download the .mobi version. You can easily supply your own TOC by highlighting the chapter headings."
3,This isn't light reading,"I've learned a lot, but be prepared to read and reread some sentences two or three times. This book is not what you read when you're bundled under a quilt, with a cup of hot chocolate, escaping from the realities of life. It's hard core politics and economics of the post WWI era in Europe, highlighting America's involvement in the peace negotiations."
4,Very well done,"This is a review of the free Kindle edition. Keynes does a great job of talking about the Treaty of Versailles, and his disappointment really shines through. He has a clear idea of what will happen due to the ""Carthaginian"" peace, and he's pretty accurate in his fears for the future.Definitely grab if you have any interest in 20th Century history."
1,Unreadable edition,"This ""General Books"" edition was apparently made by using optical character recognition to typeset from an existing copy of the original book. The result is unreadable because the technique produced gibberish where there were smudges, underlining, etc. in the original copy. I have re-ordered (but not yet received) a more expensive copy of the book which appears to have been digitized and reset--and free of errors. Google also has a downloadable (pdf) version made by digitizing a copy of the book from a university library. Despite the errors, I've slogged through about three chapters and am blown away by the sense of being in the presence of genius--that's why I re-ordered the book in a more expensive edition. Because this is an important work, I think Amazon should delete the shoddy ""General Books"" edition from its offerings."
4,A post WW1 warning applicable to today.,The Economic Consequences of the Peace by John Maynard Keynes was written before Hitler came to power and should have been a warning to all at the time of the consequences of victors treating an enemy too harshly. Given the economic conditions we find ourselves in and the war on terror Keynes' work serves as a reminder of the need to give one's enemy hope for a better future as defeat looms near.
4,"In depth analysis of the economic context, events and motivations of 1920s and 30s","This book is very good read to analyze and decompose the Treaty of Versailles. It covers the events that lead to the treaty, the conditions and circumstances underwhich the treaty and the parties involved where in and the motivations behind each one of them. All of these are analyzed in depth and in some cases backed via estimates and statistics."
3,wordy,I was expecting a little more meat out of this book and it turned out to be more of a rant than real credible solutions and commentary.
4,Finally a release that has pregame and postgame!,"How rare for these professionally released boxsets of games to include pregame and postgame. I've only looked at 4 discs as of this writing, and each one has had some pregame and postgame! Need I say more?"
1,Seller Unreliable,I have been waiting since November 15th----was to be delivered before December 1st. This is the 12th of December and still have not heard from the seller. The seller E-Mail address does not work!!!! No contact what so ever from the seller.
5,The little extra touches make this a great rocker,"We received this rocker as a gift for our nursery. The assembly was so easy to do. They separate all the pieces to match up to the diagram shown for each step. It includes a card that you can insert a picture of your little one in, and send to the person who gave you the rocker! The bottom of the seat has a little poem that you can put the giver and receiver's names into! Once put together, it was very sturdy! Remember it is a rocker and not a toy! We love this!"
1,Stopped working after 3 weeks,"Worked fine for 3 weeks. Stopped sensing the sensor. I could move the magnet past the sensor and hear its internal reed switch click open/close. But, the computer wasn't detecting it. Computer could be manually turned on. But, still, it didn't detect anything happening at the sensor."
1,"Does not work, but I know why.","I bought the schwinn 12 function speedometer at Wal Mart. I set up the computer and installed it on the bike,I tried it out, it did not work. Thinking I mounted the sensor wrong I made some adjustments,it still wouldn't work. Long story made short, I pushed down on the schwinn emblem on the computer and it worked. The contact points on the holder and computer are not making a good connection. It works good if you want to keep pushing on it, stops working when you let off. I would not recommend this item."
1,Doesn't work out of the box,"I only give it 1/5 b/c there isn't an option for 0 stars. After proper set-up and installation, the unit doesn't show any type of measurements. I'm not sure what's the problem, maybe it's the sensors that are bad. But even with the cheap price you would expect it to work at least ONCE! I guess it's a hit or miss when you dealing with low-end accessories like this one. Spend a couple extra bucks and get yourself something that will last you longer than 0 minutes."
2,"Functional, but falls off all the time","This spedometer/odometer was easy enough to install, and was quite functional for nearly two months. It attaches to your bike's handlebars with a little clip it can be slid out of, like many bike lights. Unfortunately, the clip doesn't hold the spedometer securely, and it fell off several times (when riding, and not) and was eventually lost. If they were still $10 I'd buy another, paint it red, and glue it on, but for $20 you can get a device with more functionality (or at least styling that makes it easier to find on the ground)."
3,bike speedo,"Unit performs well, easy to set up. Problems with the mounting system which uses cheap plastic ties. Another flaw is that the unit mounts in a very loose fashion to the base so it easily can slide out."
3,One Worked - One Didn't,"I bought mine from a nearby Wal-Mart and it's worked perfectly so far. Having never installed one before, I just took my time & had some extra zip ties ready...just in case. The only tool you'll need is something to trim the ends off the zip ties when you're done. I like the ""scan"" mode which flips thru max speed, avg. speed, distance, total time, etc. On the down side, I bought another for my son's bike. It either had a bad sensor or a broken wire from the sensor to the unit. It never did work. I took it back for a refund. For $10 - what do you expect? You may get one that works fine - you may not."
2,For temporary use only,"My unit lasted for little over three months. I was generally happy with it, but would not by another one. Let me tell you why.The unit has few flaws but the fatal is the bike ""docking"" piece. The plastic wears off quickly if you dock and undock it everyday. Eventually unit will fall off almost on its own and once that happens in traffic - it's gone. The readability of the display good be better and although the unit is surprisingly well sealed for moisture, it tends to suck it in.On the brights, the unit works and provides the desired functions. If it hadn't died because the other shortcomings, I would still be using it"
4,One of the two failed within two months,"We bought two - one for my bike and another for my son't bike. My son's unit works fine, but my unit quit working within two months. The part that goes on to the fork (sensor) isn't sensing any more. I know, it isn't expensive, but I hate to throw away the entire unit when the real computer is doing fine.The product is adequate for what it is intended for. It has more features than I was hoping for when I bought it. Installation is easy. Learning to use it is a little bit challenge due to the poor manual, but you'll quickly figure it out.I will certainly recommend it, but be prepared for it to die prematurely. In my case it died just before I was to venture on a training ride - not a good timing. You see, I depend heavily on this and my turn lists to figure out the training ride route. Without the distance assistance, I had to constantly check the street signs.I am seriously thinking of buying the same model to replace the broken one."
1,Occasionally resets itself. Then broke.,"Functionally, I like it - it's a nice little computer. But it resets itself every two or three months. That drives me crazy because I can't keep a mileage history. It happens when I detach it, put it in my pocket, then reattach it. Back to all zeros and I have to reprogram the date and tire size. I had a Cateye before this and that never happened.Update 10-15-11: FAILED. Lasted a little over a year. Started going intermittent, then stopped working. Tinkered with it to learn the sensor is unreliable. It started working again if I turned it upside-down, but I don't trust it enough to put it back on the bike. Back to Cateye.Bottom line: Spend the money and get a Cateye. (BTW, the Cateye I replaced is still working after several years)."
4,GREAT CONPUTER FOR LONG BIKE RIDES,"THIS LITTLE GUY WORKS GREAT ONCE YOU HAVE READ THE INSTRUCTION FIRST AND MAKING SURE THE SPOKE SENSER IS LESS THAN A HALF A INCH AWAY WHEN IT COME CLOSE TO THE RECEIVER IT WILL WORK JUST FINE, I TOOK IT FOR A 17 MILE BIKE TRIAL AND IT NEVER SKIPPED A BEAT."
2,Instructions incomprehensible,"I found the instructions very difficult to understand, and I am not computer novice - indeed I was a technical writer and wrote things like this.Instead of cramming all the information in one small sheet, it should have been expanded to full page size with easy-to-follow steps. This is a common practice and would have cost nothing.Also the leftmost characters in the display are not visible, making it harder to understand. The cyclist symbol at the upper left is so small it is useless. It is supposed to indicate acceleration or deceleration, something the rider already knows.It would be nice if they included some additional Zip Ties to secure the extra cord.The battery is a tiny thing, I wonder how long it will last."
4,Good for the price,"I purchased one a couple of years ago the the wires got tangled a coupld of months back. The wire broke and there is no way to fix it. I bought these that are identical to the old one because I like the scan feature, the large numbers in the panel and the small size. It works well. If I can say something back is that the mounting only allows a handle bar position and it does not sit very tight on the base. My handle bar is not very large and even being small it takes space there. I also have my headlights in there and of course those have to be a the front. Sometimes, it will stop measuring if you touch it forward. It will not come off since there is a plastic stopper at the end but it will move out of the sensors and stop reading your ride. It has happened with me several times"
4,Very good,It worked exactly as expected. It is very easy to install. Just does not have internal light so you can see at night.
2,PTI Schwinn 12 Function Computer,"I purchased this odometer/computer for my mountain bike. Assembly was not difficult at all. I did have one question. I called the 800 number that was provided and the agent was very helpful.Bad News- On my second ride, the unit popped off and I lost it on the trail. Poor design...Good News- I called the 800 number again, and they will be sending me a new unit as a ""courtesy"".Bottom Line- ""just ok"" product, (then again it was only $10.95), but ""Good"" costumer service."
2,works.. but horrible display,"If all you do is ride mid-day this thing will work fine.But if you ever wear polarized sunglasses or ride any time dear dusk or dawn, the horribly cheap polarization on the LCD display will make this thing unreadable."
4,"Good, basic unit",Bought this unit for my 8 year old son. Works fine. Not a lot of bells and whistles but you really don't need more than what is offered on this computer.
1,Dead on arrival,Sensor does not work. Period. I have installed at least 6 other bike computers. All worked after adjustment;This one WILL NOT SENSE WHEEL MOTION.AVOID.
4,A useful little accessory,"We've been using this particular kind of bicycle computer for awhile. We've tried more expensive ones, but they tend to break down just as easily as the cheap ones. This Schwinn works as well as any other. Don't leave it sitting out in the sun, though. If you park your bike outside during the hot summer months, it's best to take the computer with you or the screen will degrade over time."
1,You don't need buy this book.,"You need not buy this book,if you wanna pactice Exam. This book doesn't have anything to teach you.Especially, Section1-listening and Section 3-reading are old type. I recommend that you buy another one."
2,Low quality,"This sword has turned out to be a very deceptive item. The sheath is plastic. The description states that it has been sharpened ... the truth is that only the point of the sword has been. The rest (the entire length) is not and has been ground to nearly a 45 degree angle on both sides making the process of putting an edge on said sword nearly impossible. If you want something to ""hang on the wall"" and stare at, this is for you. Otherwise move on."
4,Samurai Sword,"The sword is perfect and just what I wanted. However, the stand that came with it is very cheap and does not hold the sword. It keeps falling over,so I am not very happy with that.Otherwise, the service was good and I like the sword itself."
2,handle is very flimsy,received item in a prompt manner but the handle is very loose and the blade isn't sharp at all. I don't like to bother with sending things back so i will keep it as a show piece because despite its terrible handle its still a beautiful sword. I just know for future orders to stay away from this particular company!
2,Poor Quality.,The stand is wooden and will not stay together. The sword wrapping has now come unravelled and it has not been handled but 3times
1,Bad,"So, when I got it out of the box it looked amazing. And after a few air swings the blade turned and twisted 80 degrease to the left. In all it was good at first, but there is one indisputable fact, The prices are low and looks like a good product there is a really bad part of it."
3,good sword for 15 bucks,it's a rat tang sword and came with the tsuka loose. you can take the plastic cap off of the butt end of it and tighten up the nut on it.dull blade . took about 30 minutes to get a good edge on it. on the whole it's worth the money. just dont expect something extaordinary. it's pretty nice for 15 bucks.
4,Excellent book for Christian laity,"This is going to be brief. First off, I am merely a Christian layman who is always looking to improve my Biblical study methods and with that in mind, this book does a very good job helping me. Quite understandable and educational."
4,Faith Is A Strong Vehicle,"I am a great sci-fi fan and also a person who cherishes my faith with a deep sense of God's unconditional love for all of His children. Therefore, it was a treat to find this book which delves into ""unknown"" worlds fighting for the continuous spread of the Gospel and its values. I found it to be full of humor as well as seriously thought-provoking at times. Reading through Brandon Grafir's adventures and struggles to defeat evil in his world, one can easily relate to the evils in today's society which would like nothing more than to destroy God's message of love, hope and joy. Fidelity to the Truth is the real message to grasp in Bertothy's book."
1,Color is waaay off.,"I bought expensive coverking products for my car thinking they would fit and match. After all, there are only 3 different interior colors for my year. Boy, was I wrong. The color was waaaay off. So bad that it just looked ridiculous. I sent it back, and not only did I have to pay shipping to me and shipping back, they had the nerve to charge me a 15% restocking fee for finding out that their product is stupidly off color. DO NOT BUY from this company unless you have seen the color in a retail store somewhere."
4,Golf bag watch,"Have hung this watch on my golf bag. Is easy to read,convenant, and looks good. Did not give five stars because the ring that holdes the watch to the hook is split and not solid. If you were to get caught on somthing it would come off."
5,Dead End,well this was good read and have never read this author before but will keep his name for the future
4,Good Reading,"This book held my interest , It had every thing I injoy in a book. If your looking for easy reading, this is it."
2,Wasn't for me,I tried three times to get into this book. I am an avid reader of many different kinds of books. This one just was not for me.
5,fast paced,it was the kind of book you cant put down if you like police stories this is a real good one the story catches you right away and the interaction of the characters is good when you get near the end you wont put it down! he is a good writer!
3,Dead end,I thought it was well written and had a good story line. Kept me up too late at night. Entertaining.
2,Yawn,There was nothing exciting or interesting about this book. Characters were dull and cliche. Plot predictable. Save you time and money
4,Very good mystery,This was a very good mystery that kept me guessing until the surprise ending. It got a little bogged down in some of the police procedures but all in all I liked it for it's authenticity. The main characters were new and fresh and I enjoyed getting to know them. I look forward to reading another book by this author.
3,Dead End,"This was a good read. No real suspense, the author identifies the killer pretty early on in the book. However he really delves into how and why the killer thinks and acts out his actions. A new twist for me, so I really enjoyed this book. Worth the time to read."
4,Enjoyable Read,"This was a fast paced, easy to read novel. Had my attention the whole time. This reminds me of a lighter version of a John Sanford novel. Not as gritty and not at the same depth, but similar in theme, flow, etc and similar with the ways of small town police departments. Stating ""a lighter version"" is not meant as a slight - Sanford is one of my favorite authors.If you are a fan of books similar to Sanford's I would recommend giving Friedman's Dead End a try. I am glad I did."
4,Dead End is a good read!,"Dead End is a good read if you like murder mysteries. I didn't think I was going to like it at first; but after the first few chapters, I could not put it down. Hook, Line and Sinker....."
5,A Thrill,I don't like to have to give so much detail in my reviews and would prefer to be able to just give the item a star rating and be done with it.
4,A surprisingly fun read,"Little bit of everything. Serial killings, wrongful convictions, overworked cops, multiple jurisdictions, and even a budding romance. Everything you need in a good crime book!"
4,Page turner,Loved the characters. Bad guy was a nutcase. Fast and fun to read right til the end. Would read more by Barry.
5,Tense Thriller a Great Read,"""Dead End"" is fast-paced. It grabbed me with snappy dialogue and a plot that kept me guessing until the finish."
2,Not quite,"The plot is interesting, but I get the feeling that a bit more could have been done building the character of Rankin."
3,it's ok,"It was pretty interesting, seemed just a little bit longer than it should have been and skips around a little."
4,Excellent Police Work,This is a true page page turner. The police work is excellent linking several departments in piecing together evidence to solve several serial murders. A big city detective and a country female deputy sheriff work hand in hand to solve the crimes. There work together brings on a relationship that will hopefully work for both. Read the book !
4,Good read!,I really liked this book. Lots of good medical and technical detail. A somewhat slow start but definitely picking up as I went in. A satisfactory ending and plenty of suspense. I was compelled to read and finish it and that is the mark of a great book to me.
3,Easy breezy police procedural,"The characters are nice good guys-- except for one who's attitude ends up being his undoing-- they are also rather predictable. So while Dead End is not a deep character study or an intense police procedural, it is an enjoyable quick read."
4,Moving and keeps your attention,Good mystery. Would make a great TV movie special with sequels similar to the Tom Selleck series. Going to.check.other books by.this.author.
3,Very good detective mystery,The suspense and law movement's race for time had me mesmerized. Recommended for readers who like to stay on the edge of their seats.
3,Dead End by Barry Friedman,This book started off a little slow....but it had likeable characters so it kept me reading. It was suspenseful and had a few twists and turns at the end.
4,Great story,Dead end was a great read. It kept me guessing til the end. I spent the greatest part of my adult life in N. E. OHIO and it was refreshing to read a well done book set in that area. Hope to hear more from this author.
5,I thouht it was a book that was well written and suspensful.,"I thought No Substitutions was a great book, I read it twice.The plot was excellent, but the book was kind of open ended.I think Marty M. Engle is a fantastic author."
4,Good price,"Only one thing not so good. When we first time opened the jar, it had strong paint smell. It took a week or so leaving the blocks outside of the box to get rid of the smell."
5,Great price for this toy!,"My son loves his blocks and these are just added to the growing collection of blocks that he has, you can make them educational by asking him to find you colors or numbers. Can't beat the price at all."
2,disappointing,"I was disappointed in the actual appearance of these blocks for my son's 2nd birthday... small and""boring"". Wish I would've searched more for larger blocks that had more inspiring colors/ prints on them..."
2,Poor Kindle Quality,"There are so many typos, and such poor punctuation and spacing in the Kindle edition of this book, it makes for a difficult read.The Onion Field"
2,Tedious and boring,Put this stinkburger down after 80 pages. I wanted o disembowel myself to stop themind-numbing monotony. Way too much meaningless detail and tedious descriptions ofcrap that never mattered or moved the story along.Almost as bad as James Lee Burke filling page after page with repititive scene andlandscape descriptions to get to 300 pages.Wambaugh is definitely not a Caunitz or even aMahoney but he's light years away from Sandford who is my favorite.
3,The Onion Field,The book was in VERY POOR condtion. However I only paid $2.86 for it. The descrition did not match the product I recieved. I will not purchase anything else from this dealer.
5,A Treasure,"I read this book many years ago. Last week, while I was browsing through used books in a Goodwill Store, I came across a hardbound copy in pristine condition. It was selling for $2.00. Needless to say, without hesitation, I bought it. I found myself an absolute treasure. Without a doubt in my mind, this is easily the finest non-fiction story of crime and retribution I have ever read, gripping and haunting thoughout. Only one other non-fiction crime story comes close to it, and that is SWORDFISH by David McClintick. If this book can be purchased, do so without hesitation. Jay Wickramasinghe, Citrus Heights, California"
5,Great!,Master Storyteller Joseph Wambaugh shifts from fiction to non-fiction for this riveting account of the execution of a Los Angeles police officer and its aftermath. This excellent book was brought to the screen in a fairly accurate rendition starring James Woods and Ted Danson at the beginnings of their respective careers. Of the book I must say that my realization of the identity of the gardener late in the narrative was one of the most moving and dramatic experiences of my reading life. Wambaugh is a genius!
5,Great Read!,"I really like this book. I especially am drawn to the fact that it is a real story, and I was recommended this book by someone who actually worked with the surviving officer in the story. A must read :)"
5,One of the best police books ever written.,This book was outstanding when it was written and I couldn't stand to see it only had one review as Amazon was not in business back when it first came out. It was good picture but the book is well written and based on a true story. It's a page turner that will keep you up all night and that's promise. The scene in the onion fields will keep you up.
4,What a sad but fascinating story.,This was a 4.5 in rating. What a fascinating story. It was extremely well written. The author did an excellent job of showing the two sides of the life stories and perspectives of the criminals and the police officers. It was gripping and insightful into prison life. Heart breaking to think about the impact to the remaining officer. Great read! Highly recommend it.
3,"Ok story, poor eBook conversion","The story was OK - it certainly started out well and told a good tale about a terrible crime. I found the last quarter or so, detailing the various trials and re-trials (would they ever end?) a bit tedious and sometimes hard to follow the thread of the narration.But what really annoyed me about this ebook was the very poor spelling and punctuation throughout, which I presume occurred in the conversion process. Did no one proof read this before releasing the Kindle version? It's certainly the first time I've seen this in my more than 50 book Kindle library, and there's no excuse for this poor quality control."
5,One of My Favorites,"This novel has all the suspense, all the action -- and all the humor -- of other Eric Ambler novels. It also features one of my favorite fictional characters -- the Russian agent Andreas P. Zaleshoff. If you like spy fiction, this one's for you."
4,Spy versus spy.,"It's the late 1930's and the European continent is poised on the brink of war. British engineer Nicholas Marlow accepts a position in the Milan office of a machine tool manufacturing company known as Spartacus. Since Spartacus' products are used in the production of munitions, Marlow has access to information of value to those engaged in espionage.A bit naive, Marlow is rather easily sucked into the cloak and dagger intrigue endemic to that time and place and rather unfortunately incurs the wrath of Mussolini's secret police.Cause for Alarm is an engaging spy novel that has a smooth narrative flow. Moreover, Ambler's detailed knowledge of his subject matter is quite apparent. A solid 4 stars for this early contribution to the genre. Well worth reading."
4,Gripping Stuff,"Absolutely gripping first two -thirds of the book. Wonderfully draws you into its world, and takes you into the twists and turns of the spy world. However, the final third is a major let-down. Probably because we are jaded now, but the reversion to straight story in the last furlong was a marked dissapointment after the stirring middle section."
3,Not My Cup of Tea,"I enjoyed the first part of this book, wherein the protagonist Marlow gets involved -- reluctantly -- in intrigue in pre-war Italy. There was definite, palpable suspense as Marlow begins to attract the attention of a bunch of characters who may or may not be good guys in the Europe that is slowly drifting toward horrendous war. But at one point, a long and very improbable escape/chase scene takes place which, for me, destroyed the flow and rhythm of the book. It's as if the author wanted to eat up a lot of pages just so he could get to where he could wrap things up. Without that chase/escape scene, the book could have been a third shorter, and probably would have been a better book. I've read two other Ambler books and despite proper respect for his contribution to the genre, I don't think I'll read any others. Give me Furst, Deighton or other modern day espionage writers."
3,A weak entry in Ambler's great series,"I've been working my way through this series of espionage books and have enjoyed them. In this one, however, Ambler's ""innocent bystander,"" an engineer named Marlow, is clueless about everything. And I mean everything. Perhaps this was meant to symbolize English attitudes in the years before WWII. Or perhaps it reflects Ambler's view of engineers generally. Or perhaps it was an attempt to paint the armament industry as heedless of political influences. In any event, the growing war threat doesn't seem to have reached him, something made even more puzzling by the fact that he takes a position with an armaments company's Italian office. Marlow's persona is drawn in sharp contrast to other characters, who are dedicated to causes and full of initiative. Poor Marlow is manipulated and becomes dependent on the skill of a Soviet agent.It's worth a read but lacks the appeal of others in the series."
3,It told some information,"I think this book was good but some info. that i was looking for, had great discription and fasinateing facts. I did enjoy this book!"
1,it's like a book review....,"this version absolutely sucks. its like a book report and is a summary and not what i thought it was. good for kid's who hate reading and need to get through tom sawyer quick. If your older and liked huck finn and never read tom sawyer, it SUCKS!"
4,old traditional book,This is a very nicely written introductory book on statistical methods for technically oriented readers. Emphasis is on the analysis of variance and various designs for linear models. Includes some early work on missing data. The book was not revised and hence is not up-to-date on many topics. It does not cover computational aspects of statistical analysis and if it had it would not be very helpful in today's changing world of fast computing. It is sometimes worthwhile to go back and see the way statistics was viewed in the past. Many statistician started rereading the seminal papers of R. A. Fisher in the 1970s. Fisher's work in the 1910s and 1920s still stimulated thinking about likelihood methods and the foundations of statistics.
5,A charming and pleasant book.,"I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Hope follows each member of a family of beavers for two years, observing their behavior, their challenges, and the drama of their survival. I had no idea beavers were just kind, intelligent animals.I challenge anyone to read this book and not feel for every single one of these beavers."
5,Not A Dud In The Bunch!,"It's a fantastic thing when a dance-oriented band such asShalamar can deliver a set of uptempo dance tunes AND balladswithout any crap songs because it's on ballads that bands likethis often falter.Not Shalamer-thank to the superior writing andsinging of Jody Watley and Howard Hewitt ""Somewhere There's ALove"" and ""This Is For The Lover In You"" are solid proof that,like Heatwave,Shalamar HAVE IT in the love ballad departmentwithout sounding maudlin and corney.Even solo Watley seems to be no fan of the slow groove!Of course ""Full Of Fire"",""Make That Move"" and ""Somethings Never Change"" are rhythmic,synth-spiked uptempo ravers that just leave you begging for more.So can Shalamar get the job done.The answer is a resounding yes!"
1,Cannot grease/lube after installation,"After installing a pair of upper ball joints to the front of mt 93 Nissan pickup, I tried to grease them through the supplied fittings. Very little grease went in. There is something wrong internally that is not allowing the grease to flow and fill the boot."
3,Solace for the Soul,"The Soul's Solace, by D'edra Armstrong, is packed with Pearls of Wisdom. You'll find guidance for most of the things that is required to live in harmony and peace with oneself. From self-esteem, to understanding, to being a woman of virtue, Armstrong has tackled the topic. This book tugs at our psyche and compels us to take a deeper look within. Armstrong encourages us to reach outside ourselves and climb our personal mountains.Although the book offered sound guidance and explored several topics, there was nothing in it that has not been covered in similar books. The way in which Armstrong presented the material, however, was unique and concise which made her book more interesting than most. From short stories, to bible verses, to poetry, there is a little something for everybody.If your soul is in need of solace, I recommend you pick-up a copy. It is a must read for any woman with a desire to become a better person.T. RHYTHM KNIGHTAPOOO BookClub"
2,Not my favorite reference.,"As a first year nursing student, I, along with the rest of my class, was required to purchase this text from the campus library. I promptly sold it back as soon as I could replace it with another med-surg book. The content of this book is quite comprehensive, however, my major complaint is the book's readability. Lay persons shouldn't be allowed to touch the book and first year students shouldn't be expected to be able to read this without assistance. The pictures and diagrams were excellent, but as a student of nursing, I would not reccommend this text to those of us who are below the genius level."
2,Way too cumbersome for first year nursing students,"We were required to buy this text. It seems way too technical for nursing students and overwhelming in its content. There are no chapter summaries, no glossary, and no tests at the end of the chapter to check understanding. There are some critical thinking questions scattered throughout, but where are the answers??"
3,For the money,For the money it is not a bad knife but on mine the locking mechanism is stuck so I can't close the knife and as an added bonus the knife came dull as a screwdriver
2,just another DJ now...,"I used to dig his style back in 1991,on his mid-day radio show and when he was holdin it down at The Zanzibar, but this joint is a joke...Sorry to sound like I'm hatin', this is not at all a representation of his style. He was doing what he was told.""Selections"" isn't all that either."
1,A sheer waste of money,"I find this book is a little too expensive for what you are getting in content and quality.The structure and the presentation of the book has not been planned out properly. Trying to read it is painstaking. I totally agree with one of the reviewers before me, it's full of gibberish. It's not worth the money spent. Very disappointed."
2,Confusing and riddled with typos,"I had to buy this for a course I'm taking. While there are some interesting sections, many times I found myself reading a paragraph and thinking ""what are they trying to say?"" Plus there were lots of typos (""Los Angles"", ""estimates were complied"")"
3,I bought several of his albums at once,"I listened to each of them all the way thru once, then put them on a shelf. His works are okay, but I am just not head over heels about them. I can't put my finger on exactly why, maybe it's his style. By comparison I do like anything by Douglas Spotted Eagle or David & Steve Gordon. I'm sure he has his following, and he's an accomplished artist. Please don't let my taste influence you to not take a listen to him. I am sure there will be those who feel just the opposite of how I do."
1,Shun Abduction!,"This book is on my list of the dumbest books I've read. The plot is silly. (Think of the silliest episode of Star Trek and then double it) Surface dwellers enter and then ruin a Utopian society. It's been done and done, again and again...and done better than this. Shun this clunker of a book at all costs. It's not even recommendable as a light summer read. I won't touch another Robin Cook novel after reading this bomb."
3,"Cook, Abduction","Abduction by Robin Cook was a fun read but it had the feel of, to put it very crudely, Michael Crichton's jealous and much less talented younger brother trying to prove to the world that he can do it too. Yes, Robin Cook isn't Crichton's relation at all but I compare every author who tries to pull off ridiculous stuff like this to him because I can't help but think that Crichton either could pull it off, or would no better than to try and do so. Cook is known for his medical thrillers, a couple of which I have read and found overwhelmingly boring, and, although I am criticizing this novel, Abduction is my favorite Cook novel. Fiction is fiction. It doesn't always need an explanation but sometimes authors forget this and try to slam one in there and it makes the story funny when it isn't supposed to be. I enjoyed this quite a bit and I think that James Rollins fans would too, but keep that younger, less-talented brother comparison in your minds if you try it."
2,Bad Fiction,"This was a slow, painful journey to the center of the earth. The story lacked any interesting content. The attempts at suspense failed. It's the worst book I've been exposed to in some time. There are far better ways to spend your time."
1,Trapped on a desert island with this?!,"At least I didn't pay anything for this insipid waste of paper. Teaching at a rural school on Zanzibar, I was happy to read any book I could get my hands on. Somehow this book made its way into the school; it was so terrible I couldn't put it down! Predictable plot, flat characters, sophomoric style; indeed, there is little to redeem it.If you want to have a good laugh over a bad book, look no further."
1,Someone else wrote this.,The story is totally unbelieveable. The characters have absolutely no depth and the story line is non-existent. I did not even finish listening to this unabridged audio of this book. I have enjoyed Cook's books in the past but I don't think he wrote this one.
1,Not really credible...,Disappointing. The whole plot is unconvincing and the characters are weak...I would not recommend this book.
2,Disappointed,"I am a big fan of Robin Cook, have read all his books. I feel his strongest books are those that portray possible real life scenarios, such as Toxin. Abduction reads as if it were thrown together during long plane trips or something. The characters are overly stylized and the story unbelievable and shallow. If you like Robin Cook's usual fare, you may well be disappointed with Abduction; and if you haven't read his books before, don't start with this one."
1,What the heck was he thinking?!,"I tried to have a totally open mind while reading this book. In fact, it managed to grab and hold my attention for the first ""section"" of it. Then it drifted off into something it seemed like a 5th grader on a sugar high dreamed up...My advice: don't buy this. And if you do, recycle it immediately."
2,"Starts out good, goes downhill","I like good Sci-Fi, but this book doesn't qualify. The book's beginning is good, the middle boring and trite, with an ending that is very weak. In some respects, this book is a take off on H.G. Wells ""Time Machine"" with obvious influence by Jules Verne. The story line had lots of potential that was just not met. Pass on this one, but if you have not read other works by Robin Cook do so. This book is not typical of his usual fine writing."
2,Not the usual Cook,"Having read all of Robin Cook's novels, I anticipated another exciting story. I was disappointed. Although well written, I found the subject a little too far-fetched, and not the usual Robin Cook excitement. Having also read ""Invasion"", I feel that Robin Cook should keep to the medical themes that he obviously knows so well. His medical stories are always ""can't put down"" believable."
3,"Hey, I liked it","I liked Abduction. I've read all the Robin Cook novels, and while this one is certainly a departure into sci-fi for him, Cook's usual character development was as strong as ever, making you care about each character. I think he did a fine job of creating an alternate world and he had some fun with it. Anyone familiar with his other books should give this one a try."
3,Jules Verne wannabe,"The premise was excellent, but the execution of the story was too derivative and clumsy. Most of the characters were self-absorbed caricatures, rather than people you could identify with or root for in any manner. Journey to the Center of the Earth by Jule Verne and The Time Machine by H.G. Wells are more enjoyable science fiction classics. Robin Cook is usually much better than this effort."
2,a real disappointment for this Cook fan,"I have read almost every one of Cook's books, and I found Abduction to be such a disappointment. It is sort of a combination of Man from Atlantis and Lost in Space, and not done as well as either of those B-grade t.v. shows. The premise of the book was far-fetched, and the characters were fairly steroetypical. I got lost in the technical jargon during Arak's explanations to Suzanne (the glossary in the back of the book helped, but not all of the terms were there), and I don't like to read a fiction book with the aid of a dictionary. The ending was very trite, not all that surprising, and disappointing in that the reader never really knows what happens to Suzanne. I get the feeling that Cook was writing this one to sell as a made for t.v. movie and lost sight of the higher quality writing that he is capable of. If you are a Cook fan like I am, read it so that you can say you've read it; otherwise, don't waste your time."
2,Disappointing,"I was glad to see Dr. Cook going beyond the medical thriller, but ""Abduction"" was a disappointing Michael Critian(?) clone. The premise was good, but the writing was not up to Dr. Cook's usual talent."
1,What a waste of time.,"I have read many of Robin Cook's medical thrillers, and find most to be interesting, though a bit formulatic. I find it hard to believe this book is by the same author. I had to keep pushing myself to keep reading in the hope that the book had to get better. No luck, it just kept spiraling downward. The ending was enough to cause me to literally doze off.The characters were not developed, the writing style was elementary school level, and the plot did nothing to draw me in. It's as if Mr. Cook had a contract to fulfill, waited untill there were 18 hours left, and gave birth to this weak effort. Laid an egg is more like it."
4,Definitely not a silly book,"I found the book definitely up to the quality of excitement that one always finds in Robin Cook's books. I am always intrigued by the titles and can't wait to find out their meanings in his books. Although the title/book was self-explained early, I felt it still met the suspense of his previous books. What is wrong with a medical doctor reaching beyond his profession. I found that comment a little surprising from one of the top reviewers."
1,Back cover needed to prepare the reader for a sci-fi flick...,"First of all, I LOVE Cook's books. I love the science and facts he usually uses. Even when he does take literary/artistic license, he backs up his imaginative scenarios with some facts. I was totally unprepared for the science fiction utopian storyline of Abduction- there isn't even a hint on the back cover to tell you what's coming. I figured ""Oh, maybe the oceanographers bring some oddball bacteria back with them,"" but noooo, the oceanographers are sucked into a bizarre utopia of lazy, beautiful humans. As another review said, there are no likable characters, so I found myself not caring about what happened. The twist at the end was a bit silly and felt very forced, as did many of the scenes. I'd recommend it to someone else as a for-fun, kicks-and-giggles read, but I would make sure they know Abduction is not a medical thriller."
4,Expecting sequel.,"I enjoyed this book. Great imagination. The characters were well developed, and I could feel their pleasure and their discomfort. I've read many of Cook's books, and this is one of his best. I was, however, disappointed with the ending. And then I realized, Dr. Cook has set the stage nicely for the sequel. I'll be one of of the first to buy it!"
2,Where's the real Dr. Cook?,"What happened to DOCTOR Cook? Science fiction?? I was expecting another great medical thriller as usual. Although I found the book interesting, it's not the real Robin Cook."
2,Good start but where is the end.,"I have read most of Robin Cook's previous novels and was prepared to enjoy this one. The beginning grabed my interest but when he got his characters in to the center of the Earth it all goes to pieces. Lots of loose ends. If all they wanted a professional oceanographer why did they abduct the two divers? It they were as advanced as infered, they should have been able to solve the problem on their own. The two divers were totally over the top. Their actions were not consistent with their situation. If I were a Navy Diver I would be offended by these two characters. Then there is the end? The book doesn't end. I kept looking for another chapter or at least a few more pages. So many unanswered questions. Robin Cook has done better."
1,Sci-Fi Bomb,"A poorly excecuted foray into the science-fiction genre for an accomplished thriller author. The premise of a highly-advanced undderworld civilization is something that exists only on the lunatic fringe of UFO believers, and the adolescent writing style only serves to discredit the author. Dr. Cook's editor should find a new career after allowing this in print."
1,unbelievable,"My absolute awe at how poorly this book was written kept me with it through the bitter end. Having read all of Robin Cook's other books I expected some kind of plot to evolve as the book continued. Cook has always had an easy flow to his dialogue, but in this book it is stilted and thick with ridiculous stereotypes. While I don't discourage a foray into different genre', perhaps he could at least write with the same level of conviction he has in the past. I can't believe a good editor and/or publisher who supports the author would let this book go to press."
1,Not Robin Cook,"I have read all Robin Cooks novels, and I was very dissappointed in his latest ABDUCTION. It was wise for it to come out in paperback. I am upset because I wasted the money on it, but glad I did not have to buy it in hardback (as I usually do). I love Dr. Cooks medical knowledge and the novels he derives from this knowledge. Being in the medical profession I can readily relate to his books. Not so with this one. Just very dissappointed."
1,Ghastly space opera,"This is a book that might even have had trouble being published in the 40's, the heyday of space opera. The script would probably not have been accepted for a very bad episode of ""Star Trek."" That is has been published at all, in any decade, is a mind-boggling tribute only to the venality of publishers who will count on a well-known name to sell any old drek. That any respectable writer would allow this donkey to go to print is inexplicable, save that he suspects he will never write another book so doesn't care. The 'human' characters are trite, shallow and stupid, the 'alien' characters are idiotic, the plot - such as it is - is mind-numbingly predictable, the suspense and tension are zero. I give it one star for grammar and spelling. It deserves far less."
1,I love Robin Cook & hated this book!,"But I hate sience fiction! If you are looking for and expecting a typical Robin Cook medical mystery, you will be disapointed as I was."
1,Worst book ever.,This book was terrible from beginning to end. I felt like a child was trying to tell me a story with how non descriptive it was. The only character that was of any interest was Suzanne and she was mediocre at best. I guess I wont get into details about the story in case anyone actually wants to read this but just so you know if you don't like the story at the beginning it doesn't get any better. I wish I could have the time back from reading this book. The ending actually pissed me off but atleast I borrowed it from the library instead of buying it.
2,Are we sure Robin Cook wrote this?,"So not what I expected from Robin Cook. The premise was good, but it got boring in the middle and fizzled out completely by the end. It was a real disappointment from an author that I have come to rely on for good books."
1,Stick to medical thrillers Mr Cook!,As I read this book I kept wondering if it could possibly be by the same Robin Cook whose thrillers had given me so much enjoyment in the past.If it was possible to give it less than one star I would have done. In a word simply dreadful.Word of advice to Mr Cook - stick to medical thrillers.
1,Abduction,"Pehaps it is unfair of me to review this book, as I did not finish it. I expected another medical or science fiction thriller from the usually reliable Mr. Cook, and the initial chapters seemed to bear this out. But the deterioration into a silly and boring lost society/world is almost instantaneous. The other reviewers are right on the money, and I will not repeat their brief plot (if it can be dignified by that word) descriptions. If this is any reader's introduction to Robin Cook, don't be put off. Any of his other works are infinitely better. As for his old fans (and I am one), don't allow yourself to be deceived by the author's name and reputation into purchasing this turkey. What can he have been thinking?"
2,Interesting Subject - Character Stereotypes,"I've read all of Robin Cook's books and this is the only bad one in the lot. I didn't like his choice of characters, whom I thought all were taken straight out of a list of OBVIOUS STEREOTYPES. I hope Mr. Cook realizes his error and comes home with a medical thriller which we all know is his forte.His foray into Sci-Fi was not a success, maybe if this is what Mr. Cook wants to write, he should get some help from accomplished Sci-Fi writers."
2,Ridiculous tale,"Let me summarize the story for you so you don't waste time on this book. Five divers/scientists go deep into the Atlantic Ocean, and become abducted by another species of humans who live in a large air-filled cavity under the seas. The ""aliens"" are a happy people who abhor violence, and who transfer their souls from body to body to live forever. The ""aliens"" also have advanced technology which is difficult to explain (for example, why do they use lights to set up artificial days and nights?). Our ordinary human heroes want to escape. The ending is particularly ridiculous, and comes across as Dr Cook ran out of time to think of how to wrap up this crazy story."
1,Idiotic...,"This is the first Robin Cook book I've ever read (listened to, really). I know he's better known for his medical stories and based on this ""science fiction"" story, he should get back to his forte. This book is poor on every count. All the characters are idiots. If they weren't, the story couldn't have been written at all. Somehow the 5 main characters have made it through their lives with reading a single science fiction book, watching a single science fiction movie or TV show, or even knowing anyone who has. Otherwise they would have seen every trite plot point coming 50 pages away. There isn't a single original thought in the entire book. Really, I mean it. And then, in the middle of this amazingly juvenile book, he drops random polysyllabic words as though to say, ""see, I haven't lost my perspicacity!""Based on his reputation, I'm sure some of his books are great. Too bad this isn't one of them."
1,What Was He Thinking?,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. The characters are annoying and so very stupid. This seems as if it was written for 4th graders.Do not, under any circumstance, buy, read or listen to this garbage. What a waste of time!"
1,A Disappointment!,"I am an avid reader of Robin Cook's novels. They are the type that you do not want to ""let go"". Abduction, however, is a departure from his medical thrillers and a very poor one at that. If you have never read a book by Robin Cook, do not start with this one! Any of his other books is much better. If you have read some of his books, be prepared for a disappointment."
1,Pulp Fiction,"Having never read a Robin Cook novel before, I got sucked in by all the blurbs touting him as a ""master of medical fictions"". Wow, talk about false advertising! This is 3rd rate science fiction, as written by the Boy in the Bubble. The characters, and I use the term loosely, act and speak like no human beings I've ever met. To use the description ""cartoonish"" would be an insult to cartoon dialogue writers everywhere. If this were a movie, it would be perfect MST3K grist. But, sadly, it's just a bad book that killed two evenings (and a few brain cells) for me. Thank God I borrowed this from someone, and didn't actually pay for it..."
2,Unbelievable,"I've read science fiction before so I know about needing to suspend disbelief while reading a story, but this one is absurd. The crew of a submersible and the 2 divers enter the secret world of Interra which exists between the upper & lower oceans of the earth. The Interreans seem advanced, but display some disturbing traits. There is a separate race of creatures which are half human-half machine who do all their work, while the Interreans mostly play. The crew & divers want to return to the surface, but the Interreans don't want people on the surface learning about Interra.This story is clearly a rewriting of The Hollow Earth by Raymond Bernard from 1976, which was also unbelievable."
1,"If you love Robin Cook, and I do, pick a different book.","Occasionally young authors find that even though their first few novels are rejected by publishers, after they become famous the publishers are willing to publish almost anything. However, sometimes the early efforts are not publishable regardless of the author's name. This book was published after Robin Cook was quite famous, but went straight to paperback.This is definitely not a ""Robin Cook"" medical thriller, but rather a poorly written science fiction story with an utopian society with open marriages reminiscent of sci fi from the 1950s and explanations of the Alantis Myth, the Gulf Stream, and myriad others topics ""unknown to scientists.""If you love Robin Cook, and I do, pick a different book."
3,Not a Typical Robin Cook Novel,"If it weren't for the one-dimensional characters and wooden dialogue, I wouldn't believe that this was a Robin Cook novel. It comes as a bigger surprise, because the description on the back cover doesn't even hint at the true direction this book is going to take.Having said that, I did enjoy the book, just because I happen to like the whole ""alternate civilization"" concept, although it has been done better.One thing that I couldn't understand, is that for a radically advanced civilization, they never thought of the concept of burning a backup copy of critical data. I'd have my essence stored on DVD in a safe deposit box, just in case I got in an air taxi crash after too much crystal.Overall I liked it, but if you're expecting a medical thriller, move to the next book on the shelf."
2,Saturday afternoon matinee stuff,"Perhaps I'm not the ideal person to be reviewing this book as I've never read sci-fi stuff but, as I picked this up, thinking it was another of Dr.Cook's medical murder mysteries and found myself in another world..one underwater and the precursor to Atlantis, peopled by incredibly beautiful, ageless people, I couldn't help but be taken back to Saturday afternoon matinees at the Progress theatre.It read almost exactly like a Buck Rogers adventure and all it needed was an appearance by Ming the Merciless!! A beautiful marine biologist(and when aren't they beautiful?)is with an undersea exploration party when they are drawn into a deep fissure in an undersea mountain and their mini submarine is taken to a different world by means of water tight caverns. Ye gods..enough said !!!"
1,Robin Who???,"If you like Robin Cook, don't read Abduction. Personally, I wish I could get the money back I spent on the book. It's Saturday-morning cartoon-ish. Mr. Cook's other books are believable. This one is childish. Mr. Cook -- please bring back more books like Chromosome 6. That one had everything -- plot, a touch of believability, good characters, and suspense. It was pure enjoyment."
2,my review,"This book is a work of science fiction, about people who find a world under the sea inhabited by an advanced species of humans.This is certainly not the best work by this author. I have read many of his works and they are mostly related to the medical-investigative field and much more realistic. This book deals too much in the fiction world and it is hard to accept the story. However, I did find the ending to be orginal and totally unprepared!"
1,An Unpleasant Surprise,"I usually pick up subsequent books by familiar authors, because I'm in the mood for a particular type of story. When I started this book, I thought this must be some other ""Robin Cook."" That's why I came to amazon.com to read a review. After 100 pages, I think I'll abandon it (which I rarely do to a book) & give it away. I have plenty more ""real"" Robin Cook books on my shelf to read. If I want GOOD sci-fi I have those, too."
2,Are they SURE that Robin Cook wrote this?,"Ok...I'm still shocked that Robin Cook wrote this. Are they SURE that this wasn't written by some wannabe Micheal Crichton? The only elements of a traditional Robin Cook novel (Sphinx and The Year of the Intern nonwithstanding) are the brief references to microbes (although I think that Robin Cook made the mistaken assumption that decontaminating someone externally decontaminates them completely). The rest of the book reads like a poorly written Micheal Crichton novel(including an ending almost identical to Timeline), and nothing like I expected. So why did I give it 2 stars instead of 1? If nothing else, its a good read if you have nothing else handy. As far as Robin Cook novels go, this one goes squarely at the bottom (w/Vector at the top) and I do not recommend it, but you could do worse."
1,Robin Cook Really Missed on This One!,"Having read almost all of Robin Cook's books to date, I sat down Saturday afternoon ready to be involved in a medical thriller. What I found instead was a novel with poorly developed characters and a totally predictable story line. I even went back and checked the title page to be sure this wasn't a reprint of a very early book by this author. Unfortunately that is not the case. The main actors in the story are superficial and one dimensional. Unlike older Robin Cook novels, none of these characters seems to have existed before the story began and the reader is really not sorry to see them go. The premise of a civilization existing under the earth could surely be presented in a more believeable way given today's technology. This book is a disappointment from start to finish."
1,Pass this one up!,"Well, I really wish I could say something pleasant about this novel but I'm as lost for words as Cook apparently was when he wrote the book. I can't recall the last time I've read an entire novel where I did not encounter a single new word -- new to my vocabulary, that is. Not that I buy novels to increase my vocabulary, but as I read this novel, that ""peculiarity"" stuck in my mind. The character development was atrocious, and the plot was so old and tired that even Cook seemed to give up toward the end and just shut his effort down with one of the most truncated endings I recall ever reading. I read the whole thing but would encourage other readers to avoid my mistake. Ouch!"
2,ABDUCTION,"THIS BOOK IS REALLY TERRIBLE. ROBIN COOK USED TO WRITE A GREAT MEDICAL THRILLER...WHAT HAPPENED? AUTHORS SHOULD NOT GET NEW BOOKS PUBLISHED BASED ON THEIR PAST BOOKS. THIS IS ONE FOR THE DUMPSTER!! THIS BOOK WAS BORING, START TO FINISH. I CAN'T BELIEVE I STUCK IT OUT."
1,Disappointing,I thought that this book is the most disappointing of Cook's collection. It was so bad I couldn't finish it. The plot basically has a couple of people get captured by people who live in the Earth. They have the choice to go back to above ground or stay there. The values of these people are so messed up I couldn't stand it. I promptly returned the book to the library after reading only about two hundred pages. Cook could have done better!
1,"not good, not good at all.","I have read every single book Robin Cook has written, so I was eagerly anticipating this new novel. Unfortunately, as soon as I read the first chapter I realized that this book was not like the others. It involved no medical knowledge whatsoever and was entirely science-fiction. I have to say that I am very dissapointed with this book, but his new book, Shock, coming out in March 2001 looks a lot more promising."
2,Yawn...,"As an avid Robin Cook fan, I was sorely disappointed in this book. I loved his others, so, naturally, when I saw that he'd written a new one, I was thrilled. It started out well, but then it just went downhill. I was surprised he went so far into the fiction ring. I mean, the others were at least plausible, but this one was just too out there. I think Mr. Cook should stick to what he knows and that is medicine."
2,Rather disappinting,"The book started off on the right foot. However, after about 80 pages, the book changes tone completely. I expected much more from Cook, but got the book Abduction. The Sci-Fi-ness of the book definitely belongs on one of those TV channels, but this is definitely not something you'd expect from Robin Cook. Don't let this ruin your impression of him."
1,Travesty,"Good Lord this was a stinker. Poorly conceived, clumsily executed, this book is stocked with the most generic group of explorers and aliens ever assembled. There's the Earnest Blonde, the Deep-Voiced Samuel Jackson Rip-Off, the Thuggish Navy Seals... And as for the Atlanteans, not since 'Santa Claus Conquers the Martians' has there been such an inept portrayal of an alien race. And on top of that, the dialogue is stilted, and the narration reads like it's been translated from a foreign language. But the saddest thing of all is that for all the fantastic setting and exotic background, the 'wonders' that await us in this undersea world are stunningly banal. It's all been done before with so much more ingenuity and class, that one is tempted to suspect that this Brand New Robin Cook Novel is actually a Very Very Old Robin Cook Novel; something he penned when 'The Man From Atlantis' was all the rage, and dusted off after watching Michael Crichton's 'Sphere.'"
1,"Dr. Cook, please return to the hospital!","What a stinker. Having read many of Robin Cook's previous medical mystery novels, I felt suckered after I bought and read this one. It is a sci-fi attempt by an author way out of his genre. This stuff has all been done before by real sci-fi writers, and Dr. Cook's attempt comes out at the level a 6th grader might enjoy. When I buy Tom Clancy, I don't expect poetry. When I buy Robin Cook, I don't expect a preachy Greenpeace advertisement. Dr. Cook, return to the operating room, STAT!"
1,How old was Mr. Cook when he wrote this?,"I have not read anything so juvenile for many years. Some of the childrens literature that I read while working for the School Library was far superior to this drivel. It reminded me of an attempt at Science Fiction by a 7th grader. As he points out, himself, in the book, it has already been done and much better by Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne."
1,Terrible book with a terrible ending!!,"I, too, have read all of Robin Cook's books and always look forward to each new book with great anticipation. I was so very disappointed in this book. Reviewers like Chuck Hickey might put me in the ""It's not Mr. Cooks typical medical thriller so I don't like it"" box, but that is not true. One of his early works, ""Sphinx"" was not a medical thriller, and I loved that book. The problem with this book was that it was very boring, not suspenseful, and definintely NOT a thriller like his previous books. The only reason I kept reading was I was sure it would get better, but it never did. The ending was a horrible dispappointment! I wasted my money and time on this book!"
1,"Abduction, or ""My 8th Grade Creative Writing Assignment""","This book is terrible. A plot line driven mainly by homophobia, underground humans cleverly named ""interrans,"" unflinching use of exclamation points, and absolutely no character development at all makes for one of the worst reads EVER. The only reason I finished was that I kept thinking: ""This has to get interesting at some point, right?."" Alas, no."
2,Utterly forgettable,"The first third of the book is the best portion of the book, although it's a copy of the numerous meaningless thrillers that throng the market. The rest is an exercise for the reader's patience and perseverance. I completed it because I was travelling on train and had nothing to do for twenty two hours. The plot idea is good (two stars are given for that, eventhough the idea of immortal life is a take from Amitav Ghosh's The Calcutta Chromosomes), but the execution is very juvenile and for the last third of the book the author simply lost interest, how do you expect the reader to sustain it?"
2,What was this?,"I am a Robin Cook fan, so when I bought his latest I was expecting a medical thriller. What I got was a science fiction book that was confusing and hard to follow. The only reason I finished it was to find out if the ""second generation humans"" were able to escape or used for some other purpose.I hope this was only an experiement for Mr Cook and he will go back to his usual forte for his next novel."
2,Best described as Silly,"This book is nothing but a bundle of the writer's most outrageous ""What ifs"" with barely a sprinkling of a plot. We care nothing for the characters, and find ourselves wondering whatever happens to things the writer hints at at the start of the book, like a romance between Perry and Suzanne, or a deeper understanding of the worker-clones. Altogether bizarre and childish, with an extremely poor ending. Stick to the medical thrillers, Mr. Cook."
2,Will the real Robbin Cook please stand up,This book was such a disappointment and not at all like Robbin's previous books. The story starts out fairly interesting and keeps you guessing what they are going to find by drilling into the earths core. A team of people get into a submarine to explore the findings and find themselves suck into a hole. Not bad up to this point but then you discover they were captured by aliens and the whole story goes down hill. I almost put the book down right there an then. But I thought it might get better. Trust me it doesn't. I still wonder who really wrote this book because it was not even close to the quality of writing Robbin normally creates. So will the real Robbin Cook please stand up.
4,A Thrilling Experience,"I thought that this book was very thrilling and without boring lectures. I also liked how Robin Cook used his knowledge and experience in the medical field, and brought it into his book. Even though this book is fiction, you get a sense that it maybe could happen. I usually am not into the scientific type of book, but this book pulled it off. Read this book!"
5,"Good book, but NOT typical Robin Cook","The most important thing to realize about this book is it is NOT Robin Cook's typical book. There are no doctors, no hospital, no cutting edge medical technology.It is, however, a very good book in it's genre. This book really belongs in Science Fiction rather than mystery. The story is set in the ocean rather than in space, but many of the elements are the same as first encounter stories. It's a familiar story of the clash of cultures and the resulting problems.I found it very refreshing to read this type of story from Robin Cook. Hopefully this is the first of more stories away from the typical medical setting."
1,The worst Robin Cook book ever published,"Having read all of Robin Cooks books, I'm used to medical thrillers with good story lines and well develeped characters that make sense. None of that is here. It's an interesting idea very poorly executed. It's as if the author really didn't care.This book was painfull to read, avoid it at all costs."
1,WORST EVER,"Anyone who gives this book a good review is lying and simply wants you to suffer as they did for having to read this horrible book. I have always been a huge Robin Cook fan, I love his medical thrillers. They are good, entertaining reads that leave you thinking. I am also a huge fan of Sci-fi and this book is some of the worst sci-fi ever written. The characters are so bad that to call them one dimensional would be to big a compliment. The actually story had some potential but it became so trite and superficial you simply didn't care what happened to any of these people. A noble idea that fell flat on it face is the best way to sum up this book. A much better story is Orson Scott Cards book ""The Abyss"" Now that is a fantastic book, far better then the movie with really interesting characters. Bottom line, don't waste your time with this book. If you are interested in a non-medical book by Mr. Cook, check out Sphinx. That was a great story!"
3,I loved to hate this one,"Maybe it's pointless, but I read some of Dr. Cook's later works for a laugh. This time I was sick and bed and it amused me, but that's about it. The fact is that Robin Cook does not develop characters well at all, so he needs a good strong plot in his area of expertise, which is medicine, and this book is not about medicine. It's full of weak, stereotyped characters having very unreal conversations, and a bunch of high scientific jargon that will make your head spin unless you happen to be a scientist. But you know what? I liked it. :-) I was highly amused by the names of the Interterrans... he must have had fun making those up. And I LOVED the ending. It made the book worth while to see those suckers get their justice. :-) Still, I think I'll wait till I am sick again to read another one. Stick with his earlier medical thrillers... ""Mutation"" is a particular favorite."
1,Abduction,"I am an avid Robin Cook fan and found this book to be a great disappointment. Getting past the fact it was not a medical thriller, it just wasn't well written. The plot was thin, the characters never developed to the point the reader wanted to be involved with them and the ending fell flat.I agree with other reviewers, Mr. Cook please return to the medical suspense thrillers you are so skilled at!"
1,Very Predicatable and Dull,"I am an avid reader of Dr. Cook. I have read evert book he has written and was extreemly disappointed with this book. The plot was lame and the ending unsatisying. While I did finish the book, when I did I felt that I had wasted my time.I suggest that Dr. Cook stay with what he does best, medical plots and stories and leave the deep sea to better authors such as Jules Verne."
2,Yep this one's purty near awful,"Everything my fellow reviewers have said about this book is true. It is the first (since Coma) Robin Cook I've read. I read it because I thought he has been at the business of writing for so long, he has to have gotten good at it. And the premise sounded interesting (not shockingly new, mind you...but interesting).I nearly got out my red pen and went after several passages. There are several howlers...all unintentional.The characters ARE irritating and their actions make NO sense. BUT I give this two stars (instead of one or a half) because the plot DID keep me reading until the end. Now that must be worth something!So style is absent. So the characters are ludicrous. So we saw this society in Brave New World and ninety-leven 70's SF movies and 50's SF novels...there is still a spark of something new--albeit a small one. So IF you find yourself on an island, you COULD be stranded with worse. If you have nothing to read at present...believe me you could do worse."
1,Who are those people ??,"I'm only writing because I simply can't believe that anyone considers Robin Cook's latest attempt at mass hallucination to be ""enjoyable."" Maybe those people define ""enjoyable"" the way the Marquis de Sade did...I'm going to go out on a limb here and suggest that if you've read at least ten books before you got suckered into reading Abduction, you couldn't possibly have enjoyed it. I only finished it because I couldn't believe it could stay that bad. Cook surprised me by managing to make it stink right to the end. As Opus the Penguin once said of a movie: ""Okay, maybe it wasn't as bad as all that, but lordy, it sure wasn't good!""I'm still going to be muttering to myself about the future of America when there are people living here who think Abduction was worth reading."
2,Bad TV ??,"Being a science fiction fan (versus medical fiction fan), I found the first part of the book interesting and exciting, albeit some of the character development was weak. The second part of the book turned into a bad episode of Star Trek or a reminder of ""Amazon Women on Mars"" with an ending that was put together at the 57th minute of the 1 hour show."
1,Never expected this from Dr. Robin Cook,We need more of a Medical Thriller than inter-gallactic sci-fi ...
4,Great!,"The story is beyond my imagination. The technology mentioned in the story may not be accomplished in my life time. Although there are many technical terms, but the glossary does help a lot. I'm sure that Cook must did a lot of studies before he get started especially on the field of ocenography. To sum up, the book is well written with an unexpected ending. This is another book by Robin Cook that I recommend."
2,Not Normal Cook,"This is not a normal Robin Cook medical thriller. It's a fast read and not too deep. The premise is similar to Abyss, but without Abyss' excitement."
3,"""A Pretty Decent Undersea Adventure""","Cook takes a departure from medical thrillers and tells the story of a group of undersea explorers who get sucked into the world of Interterra. Stories of undersea civilizations are nothing new, but I thought Cook did an OK job handling this one. Really liked how he presented Interterra, its culture, its technology, its beliefs when it comes to reproduction (which are pretty wild). Bascially, this civilization, which is millions upon millions of years old, has created a virtual utopia. But the more time the explorers spend in Interterra, they wonder if utopia is really worth living in, especially when it's not clear whether they will be allowed to return to the surface world. No real clear distinction is made on who is absolutely right or wrong about the fate of the explorers. Still, I thought Cook handled the story well."
1,I just hope this isn't his life's work.,"Every once in a while a successful writer comes out with a book that encompasses his life's work and philisophy. I hope this isn't Robin's. I certainly hope he didn't spend years writing it. I kept looking for meaning. Once in a while I would think that I had found some and instantly I would realize I was so wrong and I would laugh. OK, so I did laugh. It was worth [the money] for the laughs. But then perhaps the laugh was on me. I bought the book and I read it--every page--even though it was really awful. Robin, if only for me, go back to the books I love to read. Judy Parsons"
3,"A strong start, but not so strong of a finish","This is my FIRST Robin Cook book I have read and I pretty much summed up my reaction with my title for this review.The beginning of the book immediately drew me in and before I knew i had read almost half of it in just one night. But towards the later half, the book definately slowed down and was lagging. I felt I was just being drawn out until the ending.I would also like to note if you have read Robin cook's previous books which i believe MAINLY deal with MEDICAL-related storylines, you might not enjoy this book at all."
1,This is not a Brigitte Bardot title.,Please correct your data banks. This is not a Brigitte Bardot video. How in the world did she get to be a primary contributor?
5,I LOVED IT!,"This is an excellent book!It's an adventurous fantasy of another world, Narnia. It had some old english vocabulary that I couldn't understand though. I loved it! I'm going to read all the other Narnia books but this is the only on I've finished."
4,"Once a child's book, now a classic literature","When I was in junior high school, my teacher introduced me to the Chronicles of Narnia and she seemed very enthusiastic about it. So I tried it and found it a bit wordy for my liking. But I read on anyway and I became quite interested in the mythical world of Narnia, which is just like Oz, only with fabulous creatures and beasts. And I had seen the children's picture books featuring the noble lion, Aslan and the fearless children as well as remembering the animated show I saw on the TV years ago - so right now I am falling into love all over again! Now I just can't wait to re-read the remarkable tale of bestiary as soon as I can get my hands on a copy! One thing that really puzzles me, though - how come the very first book, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is reprinted as the second book???!!"
5,LION Tells Golden Age Story That Is GOLDEN!,"THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE has become one of the best-known children's books in the world. The most known of C.S. Lewis's CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, it tells the story of how Peter, Susan, Edmud, and especially Lucy helped Aslan rid his world of Narnia of the White Witch. This story, with it's sweetness and simplness, is the true best of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, a golden classic, telling a story that led up to Narnia's Golden Age! The descriptions are wonderful and the charecters are so lively.... Anyone and everyone should read this book!Also Reccomended: The Other CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, Harry Potter, His Dark Materals, Mary Poppins, The Hobbit, Everworld"
5,"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe",I thought this book was unbelievable. It was very exciting. It always had action in the book. It had a very great and fascanating plot. I loved how they walked into a different world. It was cool when all the characters were in the book.It was the best book I've ever read.
4,As enjoyable as when I read it as a child,"This book still had all of the wonder and magic that it had for me when I was a kid. In fact, the book probably means more to me now then it did then. Because now I can understand all the various undertones of the story. When I first read the book I was too young to understand all that was going on under the surface of the main plot. So, to be able to see and digest all the many layers made the book more rewarding and enjoyable. This is a great series and I plan on re-reading the rest of the books at some point.[...]."
4,A Great Book,"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is an awesome fantasy book that begins with four kids going away to a Professors house. They find a magic wardrobe that has a world called Narnia inside it. The four kids wonder into the wardrobe and find many strange creatures that help them during their various adventures.In the book there are two sides: Good and Evil. Edmund (the second youngest) turns to the bad side with the White Witch. The other three (Peter, Susan, and Lucy) are on the good side with the great Lion, Aslan. There is an ongoing battle between the two sides throughout the book.I loved the book and would give it four and a half stars out of five stars. This is the second book in the Chronicles of Narnia series. Which book you read first, doesn't matter. I would recommend it to any fantasy readers, boys or girls. I think this is a really great book and you should try to read it."
5,Just as wonderful as I remembered!,"My father read this story to me as a child. I was only lucky enough to get a chapter each night. I remember wanting more. Wanting the story to be read faster. Reading it now, years later, I'm impressed with how it still captivates me. This story is about four children who move into a large house away from their family. While playing hide-and-seek one rainy day they find a wardrobe that takes them to a magical land, Narnia. In Narnia they learn of an evil White Witch that has caused it to be winter all the time. The children, work with the lion king to try and restore some order to Narnia. This is a perfect story for adults and children alike!"
5,Mr. X,"With The Chronicles of Narnia C.S. Lewis creates a magical winter wonderland that involves adventure and suspense. It is a story about four children that are sent to live with a professor who resides in a huge mansion. They discover a world that is always winter and never Christmas. The residents are tormented by a witch that can turn people into stone. Soon a lion named Aslan arrives and brings spring with him and the power to bring stoned people back to life. Ultimately, Aslan kills the witch and the four children become kings and queens of Narnia. It is a quick, effortless read that is entertaining. Once you start you will not want to put the book down. It is an easy recommendation for anyone. I highly recommend giving the book a chance and picking up a copy of it, especially for kids."
2,not so catchey,a do not recomend this book i do not like it all if your planning to buy it return it. my dad made me read it so bad
1,Narnia,"I love the idea of other worlds and magic and adventure, and I love the idea of Narnia. However, I am not a big fan of the way C.S. Lewis wrote the book. Everything sounded too... plain and straightforward, I guess you could say. Personally, I prefer books with more interesting, colorful language. But the actual world of Narnia is amazing. By the way, I couldn't figure out how to change the star rating but I give this book three stars."
2,I could not see the point.,"""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" did not ignite any excitement within me. I had no expectations for this book, so luckily, I have not been let down in one form or another. I am not fond of mystical/fantasy books, and I could not get caught up within this world of Narnia. I found the action to be lacking, as it was described in short paragraphs, rather than shown, and I did not see any point to it. It is written very juvenilely, so it is easy to read. I did think the end was rather clever, but it did not faze me enough to read the rest of the series. I do not recommend."
2,NOT MY FAVORITE!!! TISK TISK TISK,THIS IS SO NOT MY TYPE OF BOOK. IT WAS OK IF YOU LIKE FANTASY THAN ITS THE BOOK FOR YOU. IT IS KIND OF OK BUT AS I SAID I DONT LIKE IT! THE ONLY PART I LIKED WAS THE END! THANK YOU FOR READING THIS REVIEW! I WILL BE WRITING MORE! (ON BETTER BOOKS) PEACE OUT HOMIE G!
1,Boring!,These books are probabley the worst books that I have ever read in my entire life. They keep going on and on about nothing. We were forced to read them at school. They really stink.
1,hard cover The Lion the Witch and the wardrobe,This Item was described as hard back It was not. I sent it back. I got a full refund. The book is good reading. I would recommend it. If you don't mind paperback buy it.
5,A TRULY MAGICAL EXPERIENCE!,"The first of C.S. Lewis' beloved Chronicles of Narnia, ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" is an exciting, emotionally-charged, truly magical story. Filled with beautiful imagery, exciting battles, and heroic sacrifice, the story is a truly mesmerizing work of fiction. Most people have read it when they were very young. However, I didn't read it until recently, at the age of 21. But for me, and possibly others, it took me back to my childhood, when you believed in the magical, and the unseen. That's where the book's power lies. For the young, it is fantastical and new, while for the adults, it takes us back to our younger days.This is a fantastic story that is rightfully called one of the greatest fantasty stories of all time.Grade: A+"
5,You Should Read This Story,"You should read this book.I like when Lucy meets the Faun.I also like Peter,Edmund,Susan and Lucy entering Narnia.Read it!"
5,"Why people like the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","People like the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe because of these reasons. It has a wide range of interesting characters. It also has a great plot. One of its characters is Aslan, a great lion who rules all Narnia. The white witch turns Aslan into stone and he gets free. Another character the white witch makes it always winter in Narnia. The four daughters and sons of Adam and Eve get into Narnia by the wardrobe in the spare room. They think they stay in Narnia for many years but they go back through the wardrobe into the spare room and its only been but five minutes. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did."
4,"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe","Four kids find a magical world called Narnia. They make friends and enemies along the way. They have many adventures and more to come.There are seven books in all on The Chronicles of Narnia.This is the second book.What I liked most about this book was that the things in this book were described well and its easy and was fun to read, for example the settings were described well and this book doesn't use very big words.There was nothing that I didn't really like because everything to me was well put together. My favorite character is Lucy because she is the most caring and honest one in my opinion.The scene that meant something to me was the scene with the witch, the lion and the witch's friends at the Stone table, I can't tell you why or it will spoil the book.This book is adventurous and a great book to read at anytime."
5,"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe","Four children are sent to a professor's house during World War 2. In this strange professor's house is a mysterious old wardrobe in which one of the children (Lucy) finds her way into. The magical wardrobe transports her to a land where magical talking beasts live and where an evil Whitch brings terror to the Narnians. When Lucy returns she finds that time has stood still while in the wardrobe. One day Lucy's brother Edmund finds his way into Narnia and befriends the Whitch (who really has plans to kill him). Can Peter, Lucy, and Susan save Edmund and conquer the Whitch with the help of Aslan, the magical Lion? Find out by reading The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe."
4,Good Christian Kid's Classic,"This 2 cassette tape-set has been heavily played in our car. The kids love this tale of the magical land of Narnia. The kids in the story learn of self-sacrifice, honor, distinguishing between truth and lies, friendship, etc. As a tape of a screen-play it comes off a bit stilted in places, but still translates well into the imaginations of the young."
4,Great Book,"My father used to read me and my siblings this book while we were little. Everyone got to be one of the charchters in the story. I was Edmund (although I'm a girl). While reading this book I kept pretending that my family was in the story. I was able to say to my siblings ""That's you,"" or ""You're that one,"" I enjoyed connecting to this book since it was quite similar to my family.The thing I didn't like about this book was the lack of connection between this book and the Magician's Nephew. The tree that Jadis was afraid of, wasn't in the book. However, the lamp post was. I think Aslan should have said something about the beginning of Narnia, Digory, or Polly from the other book.Overall, I wasn't able to give this book five stars because it didn't appeal to me as much as other books like Harry Potter did. (That's my absolute favorite book.) I think the story line is excellent."
1,Michael York Ruins This Recording,I got this from my local library and I had to stop it after less than 10 minutes. Michael York reads the story in a revoltingly syrupy voice that sounds as if he is reading to a mentally deficient infant. This may be a children's book but it has appeal to all ages and even children hate to be talked down to. Look for another recording and leave this one on the shelf.
1,"""Michael York Ruins This Recording"" as previously stated","I love this particular book in the series and was sooooo disappointed when I began listening to it. I could not believe that the producer of the audio tapes wasn't cringing as I was every time Michael York slipped into his Aslan, lion voice....It was really pathetic......I agree with everything the previous reviewer said about the really poor job done on this reading. p.u."
3,build your kids vocabulary,"I purchased this book along with The Diary of a young girl, Blubber, Dr. Henshaw from Amazom at a very LOW price and they all were in excellent condition."
3,It was OK,this book was ok. i didn't really act like it was the best book. It's great for little kids.
2,Read it...,"... but only if you like so called 'timeless classics' that don't have any action! I tried to read this book once, and I kept pushing myself to finish it, but I could not! It was just so boring and strange. Edmond's a jerk - I mean, if you saw a strange person riding about on a carrige pulled by reindeer, would you stop and ask them if you could have turkish delight? Gosh.Now I am being forced to read this book in Lit Lab. I want to protest, but I like the teacher too much."
5,"Review of ""The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe""","""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" illustrates the great sacrifice of Jesus Christ in assuming our penalty for our sins. Even though fanciful, it becomes a very moving account of giving of one's self for the benefit of others. C.S Lewis is a master author in the Christian faith."
5,A Magical Adventure,"This is the first book in the outstanding series called ""The Chronicles of Narnia."" Fourchildren are sent to a large country house in Britain during World War II to escape thehorrible air raids in London. Due to rain, they decide to stay in on the first day that theyare there and explore the great house. Lucy, the youngest, steps into a large wardrobefilled with coats. It leads her to a magical world with snow and a distant lamppost! Thisis a wonderful series, and many students and teachers know and have read of Narnia.Especially recommended for your able readers! A must for any elementary teacher'sreading list! written by Bob Townsend"
1,Don't buy this edition,"Nothing wrong with the content, it's classic, but the book material is ultra low end for a hard back: light hardback cover, super-thin paper (basically transparent), spine has no reinforced cloth strip, spine glued with no stitching. Dust cover okay. Don't bother buying the hardback series from this publisher. I can't see it standing up to much more wear than a paperback, which this book will get no doubt."
4,I liked it very much,"I found this ebook brings alive the old story with colour and flare. I don't have any dislikes and in future, perhaps, hope to see schools using this product."
5,Strongly Recomended = awesome,I loved it couldn`t put it down. 8 stars. It is a awesome book. It is well written and full of avedenture. I loved it to the very end.
5,Review from my 7.5 year old son,"My son and I just started reading the Chronicles of Narnia series with this book. We both loved it. Here is his perspective. ""This was a great book. The characters were very interesting. I love that the animals could talk. All ages should try this great book. I hope everyone enjoys this book as much as I did."""
4,Barrett's review,"I think that the Lion,Witch and the wardrobe was a good book. Sometimes it can get dull,but other times it is exciting and fun to read. At some parts of the book it is sad, like Aslan's death. But after all it is an awesome book. I could recommend it to some people, but not to others.This is a fun, joyful and good book to read."
4,Great family story,"I read this out loud to my kids (5, 4 & 1) and they enjoyed it. The descriptive sections often lost them but they seemed to understand the overal story and definitely fell in love with the characters.We then followed it up with the movie from Disney. Also good, but they portrayed Susan very poorly compared with how she was in the book."
5,Loved it!,This is totally my type of book. I love the adventures and excitement. And I am definitely going to read the rest of the books!
5,BEAUTIFUL,"this book is such a wonderful story. I remember when i first saw the movie when i was 7. That movie enchanted me. I searched for the movie everywhere but i found the book instead. And it was wonderful. After this book i read the whole series. I still love the chronicles of Narnia till this day. It is a wonderful, exciting, magical adventure all the way through. It does tend to have a christian-like thing to it at the end of the series. But it also has all these interesting mythical creatures. A wonderful fantasy book. I would recommend it to all children and adults."
5,Outstanding book that will build character!,"The Chronicles of Narnia by accaimled author C.S. Lewis is worth every penny. I bought a copy for myself, but I am saving it for when my son learns to read. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe will move you if are you 25 or 5 and the story is a of such a kind--that you are the better for reading it!"
3,A Childhood Favorite,"One of my favorites stories from childhood. This man had a knack for capturing his audience, young and old alike. His talent is greatly missed."
3,First editions,"Being a Narnia fan I was excited to see that ""A Celebration of the First Edition"" of LWW was published. This is a hardcover with dustjacket and includes one color illustration of Aslan playing with Susan and Lucy. The first few pages are different but the story printing on each page coincides with the first edition. The reason I gave it only 3 stars is there are several pages in the story where the ink must have been running short on the printer because some of the words are difficult to make out. Also, the book boards are covered with paper not cloth and the pages are glued not sewn. The Chronicles of Narnia have such a huge following. I think I speak for all book fans of this series in saying I wish a publisher would get it right. Print the Chronicles of Narnia as they were originally published including cloth boards and sewn pages. A little quality in this product would be a huge seller."
3,The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe,"The Lion,The Witch,and The Wardrobe novel is really great. First, you can feel your heart pounding in your chest when the White Witch screams at Edmund. Second, the adventures are like so real that it feels that your there. Finally, the characters like Lucy, Susan, Edmund, and Peter are really good in acting. That is why it is a really great novel!"
4,I liked it but...,I liked it alot. I think it was a good book and I am starting to read the whole series. The only thing that I thought was bad is that it was like all other stories always ends in happiness. Nothing very bad happenes. Though alot of stories do in a way have something bad happen like someone giving up there life for something and then coming back. I would like it (in some books) if one of the charators that die stayed dead. But that is not true in all books so don't get me wronge.
1,OMG! I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!!,THIS IS LIKE SO MY FAVORITE BOOK! i love love love love love love love love this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! kiss kiss! bye
1,"This was very, very boring!","Okay, I rarely say this about a book, but this book was so boring, I couldn't even finish it! I could not relate to it what- so- ever. If you want an interesting series with adventure and a magical twist with some creativity, read the Harry Potter series."
5,Narnia,"This book is very fascinating. It has you see the creativity and imagination of people such as the author, C.S. Lewis and the amazing world that we live in. I think it will keep everyone who reads it interested in it. Animal lovers would definitely like this due to all of the animals in this book. Also people who like mysterious action movies would also like this book because it keeps you on your toes and there are wars and many conflicts. I would definitely recommend this book for other readers."
4,Ok book,"Ok so I'm one of those people that saw the movie first. I've tried to read this book 2 times now. Although short, I just had trouble staying interested in it. I thought the movie was excellent. Normally the books are better than the movie, but in my case I don't think so. I know it's a children's book but it reads very childish to me. This is the main reason I just couldn't stick with it.My reason for 4 stars and not less, it was a great movie and it takes a great book to make a great movie. I'd suggest this to all readers, it's fast and was fairly easy to read. But don't watch the movie first."
4,All creatures big and small,"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the story of four children that stumble into a wardrobe... the magical door to another world. They learn many things while they travel to see Aslam, the great Lion. One of them is how they were expected, for that is what the prophesy said. After good conquers evil they grow up there and become kings and queens of the land until one day they stumble back into the magic wardrobe to find themselves back on the same day they left many years before. An excellent book for all.Anna del C.Author of ""The Elf and the Princess""The Elf and The Princess: The Silent Warrior Trilogy - Book One (The Silent Warrior Trilogy)"
4,Audio in the classroom,"I ordered the tape of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I teach a language class for struggling readers. Students follow along with the book and tape. This helps to build fluency. My students are able to enjoy a classic tale of fantasy while building a much needed reading skill."
5,captivating story for kids,"We heard this book on tape, and my kids absolutely loved it! We were sorry when it was over, and wanted to hear more. We often sat in the car still listening even when we were done driving. It is a wonderful, magical story, and now we want to hear the other Chronicles stories."
4,Very good,I really enjoyed it! The story hit home in many ways and kept me interested all the way through. Wow
4,"A Review of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe by Mr. S's Second Grade Class","""The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe is a magical adventure about four children who go into a wardrobe and come out into the land of Narnia. In Narnia it is always snowing and never Christmas! The children meet many creatures. They meet the White Witch, a faun, and Aslan, a lion who may save Narnia.We liked the story because the characters were great! We also like that ordinary children became kings and queens in Narnia. Furthermore the professor believes the children when they tell him that they have been to Narnia. We thought most adults would not believe the children in this situation.In conclusion, we feel that children of all ages as well as adults will love this book! If you have not read this book then we think you should buy it today!Sincerely,Mr. S's Second Grade Class"
3,Magical Story!,"Edmund, Lucy, Peter and Susan are entered into a world of magic and mystery. The White Witch capturing Edmund, a family of beavers helping Lucy, Peter and Susan and a lion king defeating the Queen is all happening in Narnia."
1,Buy The IMAGE Version,"The more widely available DVD versions of this film, distributed by Westlake and other lesser distributors, are sourced from an EXTREMELY low quality master, and are virtually unwatchable. Make sure you go with the IMAGE release."
2,Yawn....yawn,"This is the 2nd and last book of Tillis' that I've pushed myself through. Nothing here - again - but boring, shallow and unemotional characters, and a very pedestrian and transparent plot."
2,To advanced,Not a good introductory book. Too theoretical for beginners.It is one of the very few books by Ohanlon which I dont like.
5,Women's struggles: beyond the right to abortion,"For a single-volume, in-depth history of women's struggles for reproductive freedom through out American history, college-level and many a public library holding will want to look at PREGNANCY AND POWER: A SHORT HISTORY OF REPRODUCTIVE POLITICS IN AMERICA. Historian Rickie Solinger argues that women's struggles go beyond the right for abortion: reproductive politics surfaced when slaveholders devised breeding schemes, the US government took Indian kids from families, and when doctors encouraged Latina women to be sterilized in the 1970s: thus PREGNANCY AND POWER embraces far more than the usual perspective."
5,Summons to Greatness,"At least once in his life, every man is summoned to greatness. It's going to be more than once for Peyser."
3,"Good stuff, if you are starting your search here","This book is a good start for those interested in the basics of Tolkien's mythological influences. It is simply written and easy to understand for the average reader. However, for those who are looking for a more in-depth analysis of Tolkien's use of myth and relation to the more obscure texts the Professor worked with, this very well might be a rehashing of already known material. Some attention is, appropriately, given to the universality if certain mythic themes, characters, and occurences."
2,Mythology of Middle-Earth,I found this shallow and brief in its analysis and written in an annoyingly choppy style. It didn't appear to have been produced by a serious scholar of folklore/mythology.There have got to be better studies out there.
5,Easy to Read,"This book is great reading for newly weds, people married for many years and those planning to get married. If both partners read it, it should improve any relationship."
4,A good book to read on building a solid relationship,A good book with alot of information and interesting especially for young couple to understand your partner's love languages.
5,Nice!,"Had to buy this book for a class, it shipped pretty quickly and was in great condition! Happy with my purchase!"
4,wedding gift idea,This book was one recommended by Elizabeth on The View. I have purchased several copies to give as part of a wedding present.
2,Interesting but,Easy to read. The Author doesnt come up with anything new that hasnt already been written before but at least his making his topic more readable - must admit I only made it half way thru the book because there was nothing new..
1,eg,Not really getting much from it other than the dr phil talk. It is ok but not the life changing book i had heard it to be.
3,First book is better.,"Seems like Mr. Chapman copied much of his original book and then changed the pronouns to fit men. Some of the paragraphs were not changed, so it doesn't make much sense compared to the previous paragraphs because he changed from a man's point of view to a woman's. Even some of the stories were the same, which if you had not read the first book is fine, but the first book was much better for both genders. Personally I could have done without the religious justification but perhaps others will like that. The ideas are very good by themselves without religion. I would recommend the original book, but this book...not so much."
5,Best book in a long time,Fast shipping good deal. Great content. Book was recommended to me and I'm glad I ordered it. Hope I can get my other half to read it
4,Finally a non-gender based taxonomy of interpersonal communication,"While much has been written about interpersonal communication, many of the existing writings stereotype females communicating with an emphasis on feelings and relationship and males communicating with an emphasis on status and tasks.Are you feeling ""under-loved"" by someone important to you? Is someone important feeling under-loved by you? Perhaps you're communicating through different ""languages"".Finally, someone (Gary Chapman) is recognizing that we all want to feel loved and suggesting that each of us might interpret ""being loved"" through different forms of communication--the five languages.The Five Languages of Love is an intersting and thought-provoking read...comparably applicable to your significant-other, your family, friends and colleagues."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I had read many of the reviews posted on Amazon regarding this book, so I was quite anxious to peruse it myself. Upon acquiring the book, I was surprised and yes, even a bit disappointed. While the author succinctly narrowed down the ""love languages"" to that of only five, his narratives describing each of them are a bit tedious. Not only does Mr. Chapman fail to hold the reader's attention while describing each love language, he has a tendency to be redundant as well. I found the quizzes to be a great deal more salient in helping to identify one's own love language, and of course, that of your partner's love language. In short, this book should have been pared down to approximately three pages. I certainly hope that Mr. Chapman's other books (which I have not read) provide a more interesting read."
5,Useful,"I like the book because of the principles behind it, you might not be relating to the one you love in the right way and it opens your eyes to explore other avenues of expressing and receiving love."
4,Not done yet,"The first few chapters are awesome. I have a feeling that I will love the whole thing. Easy read. I would suggest reading it together as a couple sometime. Makes you think and act differently, in a positive way."
5,time to love,This is a great series! Reading this with my boyfriend and we will definitely be doing biblestudy with this! Soooo greattt
3,Informative,The information in this book/ the concept is awesome the only two negative things I have to say are 1) the book could have been summed up in fewer pages ( quite a bit of unnecessary dialogue) and 2) it seems the book was written more for men at some parts the author could have been more general (especially since he already has another book designed specifically for men). but again i reiterate i love the concept of 5 different languages and partners speaking a different one.I think this is a perfect gift for newlyweds.
3,the 5 love languages,"Interesting, but basically “old wine in new bottles“. It already confirmed what I already knew. Easy to read and understand."
2,Have not received book,"I will be happy to rate this item once I receive it. I have not received this item and I placed the order on August 2, 2012."
1,Not a full review: We put this book down after the first 3 chapters.,"Me and my fiance sat down and read this book just for the heck of it. After about 30 minutes of reading we were both bored of it. For me I was turned off even by the first chapter.""Books abound on the subject. Television and radio talk shows deal with it. The internet is full of advice. So are our parents and friends. Keeping love alive in our marriages is serious business. With all the help available from media experts, why is it that so few couples seem to have found the secret to keeping love alive after the wedding?""Chapman basically goes on to say that his book has the answer, the ""truth we're missing."" Great. Just what we've all been waiting for...And then it doesn't get interesting.If I had skipped the first chapter maybe I would have gotten through the book and thought ""oh that was nice I guess."" but that would be the best I could say about it."
2,Book better than company sending it!,"The book has been a good reader so far. But I was very unhappy with the three weeks to get here, when amazon promised it to arrive within a week (5 business days) of ordering it! The five love languages book is really a good inspiration to a couples life together and journey through understanding each other. If we men are needing a better understanding or maybe just some clarification then this is a good book to help our love lives with more than just our wife or girlfriend. It can also be our kids parents and friends too! Its a good book so far, I have only just read 1/4 of it but worth getting!"
1,A digital book that never acknowledges our digital reality,"Someone told me about this book and I thought it would be interesting. Unfortunately while it has a 2009 publication date, the information provided has a 1980s timeline. While the concept is good, the dating of the information and analysis makes it rather worthless. A quick read as it is very repetitive."
5,Love saver,"This is an excellent, short, readable book that is beneficial to any couple no matter the current status of the relationship."
5,Hubby even recommended this book to his friends.,My husband is a stubborn man and usually doesnt read what I asked him to but he read this and really liked it and really tried to use the information. Its been fantastic!
4,Satisfying and helpful,"I've been wanting to read this book for quite some time, as I'm one of those people whose love language isn't obvious. The chapters on the five languages themselves were very satisfying and helpful (except for physical touch, which mentioned the obvious point that it isn't all sexual yet failed to really expand on that) and I walked away feeling much more certain. Some of the chapters afterward were helpful, but I didn't feel compelled to read them as in-depth. His approach isn't the end-all-be-all to a happy relationship, but I believe it's a huge part of it.Though Chapman writes the book from a Christian point of view and religion does play an appropriately heavy role, I would step out on a limb and recommend this book to non-Christians as well. The basic premise remains the same regardless of your faith or non-faith and it would be a shame to miss out on such an eye-opening concept just because of that."
3,Formatting?,"Product was great however, when ordering I was confused by the questions in formating. I ordered them to listen to them on a cross country car ride. What I recieved I have to listen to with a computer or DVD player, it would not work in car stereo or a walkman type CD player. My daughter works on computers and she didn't know what format to order either so I don't think it was us. It didn't ask DVD or CD and any audio CD should play in car stereo. That's pretty much the idea of audio formatting."
2,Book was warped,"Not in good shape the whole book was warped and looked like it had been wet. It came in sealed plastic, so it was not from the mail."
1,Beware: MP3 format does not play on auto CD player,I bought this thinking it would work on a regular automotive CD player. Nope. Now I have an opened MP3 disk with no way to return it. I will attempt to re-sell on Amazon or Ebay.
1,What Silliness,Got as far as the end of the first chapter and could not read further . . . recommended by my therapist; still giving him grief for the recommendation.
2,Not enough Scriptural Reference,"Ok book, but not enough scriptural reference...Marriage will not be successful unless you do it according to the holy scriptures...Marriage was created by God and should be done his way. The book also lacks information pertaining to how couples should treat other according to scripture so that we can love each other with God's love"
1,Bad literary investment on a sensitive topic,"The concept of 5 love languages and humans only predominantly possessing 1 of these languages is clearly obsolete. Love itself is a universal language invented, established, and demonstrated by Jehovah God himself. This book does not mention the innovator of the subject, thus making this book non-Christian based, thus making it ineffectual for my life. If I wanted to know how to build a motor, I'd ask Henry Ford. It just makes since. God is the answer.Oh and by the way it does not take two years for true love to take form as mentioned in chapter 3. Please browse this book in a bookstore before purchasing, I beseech you."
5,A must read for married people!,"This is a wonderful eye-opening tool for a marriage. Easy read too! Recommend for all married couples! After you read it, pass it along."
5,Five Love anguages,Awesome book. Would reccomend for any couple. Really helps you to see how to communicate in an efficient way to your mate.
3,"Good points, but a little redundant","It's a quick read with concepts that are easy to grasp. Most of the book is common sense, but sometimes the right words to describe something elude us and I think he does a great job of providing those easily communicated words. I do, however, find the book a bit redundant and some of the examples are just a little too pat...they end too neatly with everyone riding off into the sunset with happy marriages after a few words...and I'm sure that's hardly the case. Overall, I enjoyed it."
5,Great book on relationship and Love,I highly recommend this book to anybody out there who is either single or already in relationship. The advise in this book are very helpful to get things right at the begining of relationship. Buy this book and start making your love life better.
3,Narrow view,This book gives a very narrow view of love. There are many more languages to love than five. Hold up wait a minute let's put some God's word in it.
5,Worth reading and rereading.,72 Years old. And never too old to learn. My love language is not at all what I thought. My husbands was exactly what I thought. It is well worth the time to invest in your marriage no matter your age or how long you have been married.
5,Great Read,Quick read with great information. Dr. Chapman does a great job providing stories that reinforce the information and tips that he provides.
4,Enjoyed it!,This was a great book for a couple. Helped us get to know one another. Suggested for couples old and new!
5,Excellent read,"This book provides a great amount of insight to better understanding your partner. You don't have to be in a bad spot in your relationship for this book to be very helpful. It can make a good relationship great and makes you think about the ""little"" things and how to communicate with them."
5,"Fabulous! Get it, Give it for Valentine's day","Truly explained so many behaviors for me. Personally am NOT a psycho-babble fan, but this book gives concrete examples of how to really love your spouse, family members and friends in ways that can appreciate. Just one question. Where's the chapter on FOOD as a love language???"
5,Helpful and applicable to life,"This book is written for married couples specifically, but the principles are applicable to all relationships. The book is insightful and makes the concepts easy to understand. The premise is simple and there are suggestions on how to apply the principles to your current relationships."
5,Great Book!,"I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to improve the way they communicate with their partner. Read the book, take the assessment and discuss! Guaranteed results! Very eye opening!"
3,Easy to read,This book was easy enough to read I just don't think I agree with the main premises. I can't say I would recommend buying it but if you know someone who has it could be helpful.
5,Wow. What an eye opener,"I read this book on advice from a friend and I was very enlightened by all the incite this book provided me into how everyone feels love and shares it. Reading this book has given me such positive change in all my relationships, family, lover, and friends.I have gone on to buy this book for 3 friends and my mom. And I continue to recommend it to anyone who cares to want to know."
5,A great read!!,This is a really good tool to open your eyes and be able to communicate more effectively in a marriage.
5,A must read,Great book. Answered many of questions about falling in love and staying in love. Understanding and speaking your partner's love language is essential for all couples that find themselves no longer in the honeymoon phase of their relationship. I loved this book.
4,Good,"This book provides good insights and practical suggestions for established couples. Not preachy or sappy, it is easy to read with pleasant and appropriate stories to illustrate the author's points."
5,Awsome book with nyc prize,"My fiance told me about this book and after reading it, i realised that i still have a lot to work on on our relationship and the secret to a healthy relationship is in this 5 love language.I recommend this for all who is plannin on going to the altar or in a relationship."
5,Married? Read it.,"I have been married for 40 years and though I have figured out some of these things, I still learned a bunch. Awsome for anyone of any age. Easy reading, and well worth the consideration."
4,Interesting information,A friend recommended this book in order to study relationships and why it seems some of us understand each other easily than others. I was not disappointed. Very interesting...I have loaned it out already.
5,5 love languages,This is an easy to read book about a positive approach to viewing and working on relationships - marital and otherwise. I'm now interested in reading the version for children.
4,Good Stuff,"I felt like the author could have written this book with about half the words he used, but the content is good stuff and has already been helping my already-great marriage!"
5,5 Love Languages,"After having problems in my marriage, I was told about this book by our Pastor! My husband and I read it togeather and found out , not only why we were having our problems, but actually fell more in love !! I have bought a total of 9 books so far and have been giving them to friends that are having problems but also those that are engaged to be married !! It really does have the secret to love that lasts!!!!"
3,Worth reading,"Chapman explains how we can live and love together yet not understand that we don't connect on the same wavelength. By observing that some people touch, others use words, gifts, time, or actions to express devotion the recipient may only receive a different language. It has helped me understand how my girlfriend enjoys having time together but does not value gifts."
5,great,Bought this on recommendation and found its insights very helpful in how I now think in my relationship. Recommend this to anyone.
5,A gift for hubby!,"I got this for my husband, I already had the original for me, but I got this one for him as it is written in a way that's easy for a man to relate to. He finds it wonderfull."
5,the 5 Love Languages,"Great book to revitalize your marriage, I highly recommend it. Heard about it through a friend and was impressed with it."
5,Great book with great insight,This book is a must for anyone in a relationship. It's a short and easy read that will definitely bring some light into your relationship.
5,Best boook ever!!,"Anyone who will ever be in a relationship needs to read this book. Had I read it years ago, I might not have been divorced. I could easily see why the marriage didn't work. We spoke two different love languages."
5,Amazing book!,If you read this book with an open mind it can truly strengthen the depth of anyones marriage or relationship and even with people in your life you care about. Knowing someones love language can be powerful. Great book and I am constantly buying a copy for my friends and family.
4,A book for everyone...,This book will reach you and give you a whole new way to look at love!!! Brilliant!! There is not a soul that would not benefit from it..
3,I HAVE NO SUMMARY,I rented the wrong edition. I'm sorry It was. My first time. I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN THIS BOOK please.
5,Great book and in great condition!,"I really enjoyed the content of the book and was very happy with my purchase. Also, VERY quick delivery!"
3,Subset of a better book on marriage,"The advice given in the book was good and valid; however, it seemed to be only a subset that given in a much better marriage book, His Needs Her Needs, by Dr. Willard Harley --- a book which I fully credit for saving my own marriage.I've got to believe that Chapman borrowed from Harley in some concepts. For example, the author uses the concept of the ""love tank"". But I believe that Harley arrived first at the party with his concept of the ""love BANK"".Also, the readability of of The 5 Love Languages suffered somewhat by the author's overuse of quotation marks, i.e. presenting conversations between individuals, instead of speaking directly to the reader.If you're looking for a quick read, then 5 Love Languages is OK. But if you're seriously trying to save your troubled marriage, His Needs Her Needs is the way to go."
5,Must-Read,The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts is a great book at helping to understand that we all express and receive love in certain ways (languages). This book goes into five different love languages that people use to give and receive love.I wish I would have read this book prior to my marriage. I would have been more likely to see that my wife and I were not communicating in each other's love languages very well.I will probably be purchasing this book again as I constantly have it out on loan to friends/family. I may buy several copies to give as wedding gifts and also for friends whose relationships are going through testing times...I strongly recommend this book for anyone and everyone. It helps in relationships other than romantic as well.
5,Pretty good,"Many things covered you will know, but it can make a huge difference to be reminded since this is life-altering stuff we're learning about..."
5,Required Reading,"I think that this book should be required reading for any couple about to get married. For those that are already married, this book could save or better your marriage, assuming of course that that is what you want. It's an amazing book for the men and women of the relationships. It's a quick and easy read but so full of excellent information. Read It!!!"
3,"Quick Read, Not Terribly Thought-Provoking","5 Love Languages helped me analyze my current relationship and reflect inwardly about what was causing tension in my relationship and what could alleviate that tension. That said, I found the text repetitive and containing generalizations about societal roles and female/male stereotypes. It's the kind of book you can read at the gym, and for the low price, it's worth it."
3,Good read and informative,The book is a good read and very informative; whether or not your marriage is in trouble it good to know how to communicate with your spouse.
3,Product was not complete -pages torn out.,It was sold to me as new. The Profile for wives had been torn out so I wasn't able to take the test for myself. I was quite disappointed.
5,5 Love Languages,"I haven't had time to read this one yet, but it arrived in good time and in the condition advertised. I'm well pleased with it! Pam"
5,This will help,This book will help any troubled relationship. I would recommend this to everyone. Can't wait to read the more specific books.
5,Great Tool,"Everything in this book makes common sense which to me means it's got the right answers. Me & most other people seem to brush aside common sense communication practices, but this book will bring them to light. It's easy to read; I read in about 2 days. Great read if you're single & looking or married."
5,LOVE THIS BOOK! Use it with almost all my couples clients,"LOVE THIS BOOK! It's wonderful for helping with communication and understanding how communication conflicts can happen. It's not a be-all end-all type book but it's a good book that can help couples have more understanding in their relationship. They can also get back to loving as they understand why they do the things they do, what they need and how they can give to their partner. Another FYI - I use it in secular counseling.LOVE IT! :)"
5,Great book to better understand one another,"This book has definitely helped my wife and I better understand each other, so that we have been able to better appreciate why we each do things, and have been able to improve our relationship. I have the physical touch love language, and my wife is the quality time. So we have been able to better understand and appreciate each other because of this book. We highly recommend it!"
2,not worth the money at all,I liked the ideas of the book but don't understand why it has to be about Christianity. I didn't pay money to have it shuffle in my face over and over again. DISAPPOINTMENT
5,The 5 Love Languages: The Secret to Love that Lasts,"I wish I had read this book many years ago.I've read many other books, and watched videos on relationships, like 'Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus', etc., but no other source has helped me understand what women long for the way this single book has.His explanations are so simple and to the point.I wrote the 5 languages on index cards and have them as book markers in my Bibles and other books I am reading, so that I can remind myself of each on a regular basis.If you've ever struggled with trying to figure out what your special lady is hoping for from you, buy and read this book.The mystery is finally solved."
3,Good concept but somewhat flawed,"I think the basic concept is sound. Folks respond to different ways of showing love. I don't think the 5 categories are exclusive nor do they represent the universe of ways people best receive love and affection. The author addresses this last point somewhat by saying there are many dialects within the 5 languages. Some might view that as a cop out.My strongest complaint is that the language of the book is dumb downed to reach the lowest grade of reader. Like I say, the basic concept is good, but I was somewhat disappointed overall.The other thing is the book is more appropriate for long term relationships that have suffered thru neglect. I would have preferred to read something where the focus is on nurturing and sustaining the in love experience."
5,For Singles too!,"I believe Dr. Chapman captured the essence of what was totally wrong in my past relationship. I have learned from mistakes from this book and though I am in no rush to get back in to my past relationship or with someone new, I feel empowered by this book to look a my relationships in a new way and willing to start out speaking the right love language now instead of trying to be reactive with the tools in the book after I have a problem. I do feel that you have to make sure your spouse is willing to read the book as well to engage him or her in what you are trying to change in the relationship though Dr. Chapman does provide one relationship example where the husband never meets Dr. Chapman the wife has sessions with him alone and the husband never reads the book, yet they still find a way to love again through the wife's efforts. I think that is very difficult but possible. Good luck readers I hope this helps."
5,Very Helpful,"Opened my eyes to ways to express myself to others. Great for anyone searching to find different ways of expressing love and caring to someone! If you're thinking about purchasing, just do it!! You won't be sorry."
4,Great book,"Problems with relationships? well, maybe you don't know your love language. This is a pretty simple, to the point book, good for the beginning of relationships. Kind of Relationships 101 class."
5,Excellent book,Upon the advise of my counselor I bought and read this book cover to cover. It's truly amazing to me how informative this was. Not being much of a reader myself I found I couldn't put it down.
5,Excellent book!,Excellent book. It gives you so many answers about marriage problems and helps you to improve your emotional life! It's a real treasure in my library!
4,Applicable.,"I thought the book very well written and is applicable in very relationship, not just marriages. I was suprised to learn a few things about myself and my spouse."
4,5 Love Languages effectively explains the love barriers,"This book is an easy read, especially for someone who doesn't read that often. A few friends recommended the book to me now that my husband and I are in our 8th year of marriage. It really helped to explain why he doesn't think to do the things that I need and why my ways for showing love aren't always received as positively as I would hope. I have recommended the book to many friends and I've even registered to hear Mr. Chapman speak at a nonprofit event next month in Chattanooga!"
4,simple stuff,"Although the book is loved by my friends and me, there is nothing too out of the ordinary about this book. The positive is majorly the way it classified the love needs of people. I liked the guides it had about how to please the people of certain classification. And really that is about it.The writing was very simple. Thus, people whose first or even second language is not English understood the book's contents. Since the content isn't heavy or too new, I used to read it before sleep.Do read it if you are in a relationship and want a simple read. Do check out its website before ordering."
4,Very Helpful,"Knowing the love language of a person gives you insight into their priorities. It also helps when two of you that don't speak the same love language have a way to relate. My daughters' language is gifts, her fathers' is service, this book was as helpful as a foreign language dictionary to them. For years they had tried to show love and the other person had not comprehended it at all. For families, managers, leaders, anyone dealing with others: it is essential to understand your own language as well as that of those you interact with, underlying their spoken words will be their basic languages. These aren't only used for love, but for most of daily personal interactions,"
5,It all makes so much sense,"I was drawn to this book because I was recently engaged to be married for the second time. My first marriage lasted 22 years. If I had known the ""primary love languages"" at that time I may have not gotten divorced. Well, we can't change the past and I am going to try very hard to make my second chance at marriage successful!The book helped me identify those areas that make me happy and those of my fiancé through simple exercises. It was written in simple, easy to read format using different scenarios that I could identify with.I have shared it with my fiancé and family. Although some were hesitant at first, they have taken an interest in how it works. It was great reading and would recommend to anyone who is involved in a relationship."
1,Same stories different cover,My husband and I enjoyed and learned from the first one we read. I thought this version would be geared toward men and he might like it. Imagine our surprise when we opened the book and the stories were the same.
1,"If you haven't read his other books, read this. Otherwise skip it!","Like a couple of other reviewers I had read the original Five Love Languages. It is insightful and has helped me and my wife communicate much more effectively. If you haven't read that, then by all means buy this book. Unfortunately this book has hardly been changed from its original edition and I believe that there should be some sort of disclaimer. Luckily Amazon accepted the return (I purchased the Kindle edition) as I reported this to them within a day of purchase."
5,5 Love Languages,Bought it for my ipad. No problems with the service. Fast delivery. The book has been enjoyable to read. I would recommend it.
4,Thought Provoking and Challenging,"This has challenged both my wife and I to think through how we view each other's strategies in love. Gary is a master in these areas of thought! He ranks high in my opinion.I am a Bible teacher, and have been an expositor of scripture for many years. I did miss direct references to how these languages relate to the love of God expressed in Christ. I have not read all of Gary's works. Perhaps he addresses this aspect in other books.I am very appreciative of his work."
2,nothing new here,This wasn't even much of a repackage of the original work. I thought it would have more male specific content but it had nothing really new or specific in it. disappointed.
4,5 love languages,Good contentWritten so that it is easy to read and understand.Short Chapters so that you can contemplate them once read and discuss them with your partner. Simple straight forward but very timely.I wish I had know about and read this book many years agoWillow
5,Wished I read this marriages ago.....,"I tell all of my clients about this book, my profession is counseling people through grief and loss. Not only would this book assist people when they are that verge of breaking up, not communicating, literally feeling no hope, it will also help siblings understand parents and why they loved them the way they did growing up. It makes perfect sense to me that we speak different love languages we are not all cut of of the same mold! What feels loving to one person may feel totally annoying and unloving to another. The author works with real couples in the book which could not it make it more clear. You will have your Aha moment!AND give your relationship a beautiful gift."
5,Could have saved my marriage...still might!,"I was beginning to get a bit put off on marriage books, as the last 2 I read didn't do much for me. A friend suggested that I read this book when I was (still am) having marital problems and I told my friend I didn't think I was loving my wife the way she needed to be loved. Turned out, I stumbled upon the core concept in this book. This book put into words so eloquently all the thoughts I was having and made my have all sorts of further realizations about my marriage. If you read one book on marriage, this is the one it should be. Its short, simple, but powerful. Had I read this book earlier, I could have easily saved my marriage. I know now how I need to love my wife. This book was so good that I ordered another book written by the author ""The 5 languages of apology""."
5,A true classic,I've heard of the concept of the five love languages for many years. It's only now that I am reading the book. And now I finally understand why this concept has made such a big impact on our culture. Gary Chapman has eloquently explained the basic needs of man in the five love languages.
5,An amazing resource for marriages!,"My wife and I have used Gary Chapman's ""The Five Love Languages:The Secret to Love that Lasts"" as a marriage counseling tool for years. It is still eye-opening to couples as they learn how to love their mate as thye desire to be loved. Couples are amazed to learn that they love the way they want to be loved, but are often blind to their mates' unique love language. What a difference it makes when you begin to express love to you mate through their love language."
5,Love Languages,"I read this because it was recommended to me. I'm in a relationship that is on the verge of ending. I was hoping for something to help me fix it or at least give me a way to cope. This book was astounding. I intend to try speaking my spouses love language, if I can change our relationship it might save us from losing a 6 yr relationship. I intend to recommend this to all of my friends. You never know who it might help. Fantastic book and highly recommend for everyone. Enjoy."
5,Essential.,A guide that has so much truth and wisdom.It can be a bit scary though will give you all the confidence needed for the future
5,Good book!,Several people had recommended this book to me at my bridal shower. I decided to order the book but didn't receive it until after my wedding... My husband and I had fun time going through the book together and taking the quizzes. This book is a great coversation starter and definitely worth purchasing.
5,Love this!!,Never knew anything about love languages before this book! It has definitely opened my eyes to how different people express and receive love!! Easy read!!
1,Fist of what!!,"This is a documentary about Bruce Lee, not the movie I was expecting, poor picture quality. Also not the real Bruce Lee in fights back from the Grave."
4,Verified my experiences,"I had my first Soul Travel experience 40 years ago while playing high school football. This book validated and supported my experience, and also my active dream life, as real."
2,Not what I expected,"The blip about this book sounded promising, so I bought it for my best friend. I was a little taken aback by the author's point-of-view. Not a very good read..."
1,Lost Dreams,I started reading the book very eagerly. But I found it soon very boring. It took me so much to finish the whole book. I must say that I felt too disappointed about the poor writing style and complete lack of a cohesive structure. It sounds to me like a story-telling book for babies at day care.
5,Siempre la misma pregunta,"I won't give a synopsis of the book b/c everyone else has already done that for you. What I can say about this book is that it is an impetus. After you read it, you'll most likely be hungry for more information about this brutal time in a seemingly well-developed country. Questions to consider: Why the silence of the press, with the exception of Timerman's newspaper 'La Opinion' and the 'B.A. Herald?' How could someone treated so horribly come out of it okay? Why did this happen after Pinochet's regime and the Nazi regime? This is post WWII, so why? Where was the rest of the world? The book is splendid, the first chapter gut-wrenching and beautiful. You will love it as much as Elie Wiesel's 'Night.'"
2,memoir or political commentary?,"Although Timerman gives the best description of torture possible, I found this book to be a lot like reading a really long newspaper article. As a journalist, Timerman often gets caught up in the socio-political environment rather than the experience of torture and prison. This is supposed to be a memoir, not a political commentary on the situation in Argentina. I appreciated what Timerman wrote, but in all, I found the writing to be rather dry."
3,Down the Emperor's Road with Hiroshige,"This little book provided me with the first full set of copies of Hiroshige's ukiyo-e prints of the 53 stations of the Tokaido which I had come across other than in museums. The print reproductions selected for inclusion are a less common set than usually seen, and so have added interest. Unfortunately the small format of the book means that the illustrations, of which only half are in colour, are small, only about 125 mm by 75 mm. The black and white ones are only about 50 by 30. Buy this book if you can find it. What it will do for you is stimulate your appetite and make you search for a larger format book with bigger and clearer images, and until you do find such a book, at least you have this one. Although it does not contain a full set of the Tokaido prints, ""Hiroshige"" by Matthi Forrer is an excellent next stage in your love of works by Hiroshige."
2,Nothing Sacred,The title says it all. This would have been a much more enjoyable movie had the original that was used have been a good one. At best I could only give the quality of the picture a C- or D+.
2,You'll never look at raw eggs the same way again....,"Hazel Flagg did something I never have seen anyone do with an egg before...suck the raw innards out!! This really grossed me out, but I guess back then it was the A #1 cure for a hangover. That was the most memorable moment in this movie...does that say anything??I really like Fredric March, and while he was cute and sweet here, I just didn't care for this movie at all. I found it too silly and shallow. But maybe I'm just not into comedy such as this. It was one of those movies, where midway thru you are thinking....will this be over soon??? I give it 2 stars only because Fredric March's handsome face graced this celluloid wonder. I recommend only renting this video..."
1,"Great movie, terrible DVD quality","This is a great film, but do NOT buy the copy of the DVD with the airplane on the cover, it is TERRIBLE. Fuzzy, poor sound quality, cheap graphics on the outside of the DVD case. It looks like something tossed together by some company who makes bootleg copies from the t.v. I've never heard of the company (Timeless Classics), and on top of everything else it arrived scratched and loose in the case. Movie, five stars, DVD quality, MINUS 5."
3,Too small to be fun,"I bought this set of blocks for a 1 year old daughter to play with. When they arrived, I immediately wished that they were bigger and less of them. The pieces really are tiny, and therefore were not a lot of fun for a child to play with who was most concerned with stacking blocks as high as possible. My daughter also has cube blocks that are about 2-3 times bigger, and big Lego blocks. Of the 3, she spends most time withe the cube blocks and Legos and generally ignores the small wooden blocks.Another annoyance is stepping on them (they get all over the place) and picking them up. I would not recommend buying these at all unless your child has a separate playroom where they will not get in the way."
4,Very colorful blocks!,"This is a great set, it looks very durable. My daughter is getting them for her bday so I can't say much about the paint I have read some mixed review, but it seems pretty durable."
1,prop 65 warning,If these blocks have a prop 65 warning(known to cause cancer)doesn't that mean they are dangerous? Check info on item. No one else seems to have noticed this.Ive noticed many melissa and doug items here on amazon have the prop 65 warning and it makes me wary to purchase them.
2,"Blocks are way too small, and too light","These building blocks are way too small - you can't build much of anything with them unless you stack tons of pieces on top of each other carefully...which is impossible for a toddler, and my assumption was that this set was meant for younger kids. A toddler can't do much with blocks that are 1 inch x 1 inch square. Another negative is that the blocks are super lightweight - you need some weight in a good building block in order to balance things when you're stacking them. My son initially tried to play with these, but he quickly lost interest after every tower he built containing more than three 1-inch blocks fell over. The color is nice, but the paint has begun to chip after minimal use. I'll be ditching this set and getting something larger and more heavy-duty. I would have expected better quality from a Melissa & Doug toy."
2,Too small and uneven sizes,"I was extremely upset when my son dumped these blocks out on Christmas morning. First off, about a third of the box was filled with sheets of styrofoam, was that to make me think I was getting bigger blocks? Why not just make the box the size it needed to be. Second, the blocks were not uniform in size. Such as, some square blocks are smaller than the other square blocks. This makes it extremely difficult to build anything that will actually stand for longer than a few seconds. My 3 1/2 yr old gets very frustrated with these blocks. I will be looking for a replacement set from a different company."
3,Pieces a lot smaller than they appear,"We have not been able to give this to our son yet bc the pieces are still pretty small and we have been given much nicer, cheaper and larger blocks, so we will wait to give these to him."
3,For granchildren 4 and 7,They were smaller blocks than in the old days:) Prefer the little larger arches and blocks/shapes. Colors were bright and true
4,my son loves it,my son loves these blocks the only thing i don't really like is that they don't really stay in place as well as i thought but my son doesn't care long as he can make what ever is in his imagination.
3,Depends on child's interest!,"Not all kids like building and construction! My daughter was not interested at various stages of her development. So although it was not played with by her, I still used it to enforce teaching shapes and colours. However, I do see potential for it later when teaching geometry!:)"
2,Disappointed,"The wooden blocks that I just ordered and received are not at all what I had hoped they would be. I worry about the paint quality (made in ""China"") and the size of them is not what I had hoped. I wanted to add another set to the set I currently have (purchased 20 years ago, and are like new) made by My Child's Destiny... sorry Melissa & Doug, but I am going to have to return them."
3,dont like them,"The blocks are too light weight, too small and too many blocks to stay interested in building anything. I regret buying it but dont want to go through the hassle of returning it. But my biggest complaint is, its just too many blocks and extremely small and light weight."
3,"Good quality, smaller then expected","I got these on sale through Amazon for a great price. I am happy with the quality, they seem nice and durable. There is more then enough in a set for a few kids to play. I will say though, I thought these may have been a bit larger, but still a great toy."
4,Simple wood blocks,"These blocks are ok. Simple toy that is done right. They are wood blocks, but a little small for the younger ones, but our little guy just liked to knock them down after we had built a small castle.A few complaints:1. They smell. Even to this day (8 months after purchase) they still smell odd. I don't know if it is the paint they use or what but it can be annoying in smaller spaces.2. A few have splintered a bit and this causes us to have to sand it down or throw out the piece for safety reasons. We were a little surprised by this.3. The storage box is thin cardboard. We had to find a different storage solution in a matter of minutes, as the box got destroyed. On their other wood block set they provide a heavy duty wood crate for storage. I'm not asking for that for this product, but something a little more substantial would be great."
5,Even cut wood blocks,"The blocks are great, there is a good variation in pieces that kept the kids busy. The blocks themselves are evenly cut and measured, whihc to me was the most important thing. I've bought blocks before that contained pieces of ""Almost"" the same size, and they frustrated the kids to no end because they could build high without noticing slants or uneven bridges, etc. Good variation of pieces and colors. Best option for the classic toy that i have found yet (And we've gone through our fair share of building blocks)"
5,great toy for the imagination,I bought these for my grandson who will be 2. He is having so much fun with them by sorting colors and stacking then in piles. I recommend these for any early age child.
4,Wooden blocks,My 20 month old likes them but gets frustrated when her towers topple over. Another few months she'll like them a lot more.
2,Made in China,Too bad it is made in China like all their other toys. I used to be loyal and willing to pay more! Give me back the old M and D days.
3,nice to build,Probably not suitable for 2 yr old since he just knocks them down. Hard to stay together. have to put them in a bin since they are always all over the house. I think I prefer legos better since they stay together better.
2,blocks are way too little!,"I was wanting to supplement my dwindling set of blocks and these looked like just the right thing. I was careless in not checking on dimensions of the blocks. These blocks are from 1"" to 3"" and about four times smaller than the set I had. I didn't even open the cellophane wrapping but will donate them. I was mad at myself for not being more careful."
3,Wish I had just bought the larger set of 60 blocks in the first place...,"I bought two boxes of these blocks for my son when he was two because blocks are a wonderful open ended toy. The blocks were well made and the paint never chipped on ours. Although the product was as described I would not buy them again.I found these to be so small it took a lot of patience and time to build larger structures. My son's creations would take a while to build, then fall over easily. My son and I had a few opportunities to play with larger blocks and it was so much fun to assemble huge, more stable towers, quickly. I gave all our little blocks away and bought the Melissa and Doug set of 60. We now have a daughter who is almost one and both children use them daily in different ways. If I could do it all over again I would have saved money and began with the set of 60. We are considering a second set of the larger blocks since they are so much fun and well worth the money. [...]"
2,Pieces are too small and light,"This is a durable, quality toy. Colors are vivid and the paint endures constant falling/smashing. However, pieces are too small for any child less than 4; not because they cannot hold it but because they do not provide adequate stability when the child tries to build something. If the pieces are not leveled perfectly, they fall apart with the slightest touch because they are too small, narrow, and LIGHT. And if your child is less than 4 years old, s/he probably will not have the patience to built up anything that falls apart constantly. Overall, toy has very good material quality, but I would go for sets with bigger pieces if the child is not 4 or older."
1,Bad smell,I was very disappointed by this purchase as the blocks have a very strong smell from the paint. I got a headache from it and didn't let my child play with them afterwards. I expected more from this company.
2,Dissapointed at the quality,"I have purchased several M$D wooden toys, and they are all of good quality. So I was disappointed what I opened the box: the blocks are poorly cut,some have chips, some have cracks,indents...and the colors are not that great either."
4,Great but expect the blocks to be small,The box was much smaller than I expected for so many blocks. this is because the blocks are pretty small. I had to keep the smallest ones away from my toddler for a while. Great to play with and even survived the bathtub!
2,too small,I wouldn't recommend this. I totally agree with Tracy's comment. They are way too small. I thought the price was great but when I saw them in the store I was so disappointed.
3,Too Small,"I was under the impression these were big blocks, just like the old fashion ones. My wife and I were searching for months to find some big colored blocks for our daughter. These were not them. Still enjoyable for her but we have to keep a close watch on her so she doesn't fit them in her mouth."
5,A must have for any 3 year old,"I purchased this for my 3 year old and he loves it. I actually also enjoy building things with him too. It works out great as it's a activity for us to spend quality time together. My 18 month old gets in there and tries to stack with us also. The blocks are a bit small for him to stack but as his fine motor movement improves, he'll be right there with us."
4,good stuff but a few crooked blocks,"these are on the smallish side, which works out fine for me and my tot as we live in a small ass apt. however, a few of them are not so straight, making the challenge of building something small and knocking it down a challenge indeed."
5,love the imagination,what you see is what you get - 100 little wooden blocks of fun shapes. my kids have so much fun building a city and garages and tunnels and all sorts of fun stuff with these!
4,"Great toy, but much smaller than expected","The colors are bright and the toys are well made. They definitely have been played with a lot since getting them. I think this would be better for much older children, since the blocks are so small. It takes a long time to build anything big from them, which can be frustrating for a 3 year old."
4,good blocks,"I ordered these blocks for my almost 3 year old. Overall the quality is good, they are bright colors and my daughter enjoys playing with them. But when I ordered them I was expecting them to be bigger. The blocks themselves are on the smaller side so I do have to help her play with them which isn't a big deal. But if they were bigger they would be easier for younger children to stack without help. But I can see her playing with them for years to come so overall I am happy with my purchase."
5,Perfect gift.,I loved this because it reminded me of the ones I used to play with at school! Now my son can enjoy them!
3,Smaller than expected.,"The blocks are good, just smaller than I expected. They are a little difficult for my 18 month old to manipulate."
4,Nice blocks,"These are really nice well made, colorful blocks. The only thing I wish is that they were larger in size."
2,Disappointed,"I was going to give these blocks as a birthday gift, however after I received them I realized I could not. The blocks are very small. The packaging is very deceiving making it look like there are more blocks."
4,Good blocks!,"It's a little pricey, but if your willing to spend 17$+ for blocks, these will be a fun toy. The pieces aren;t too small so toddlers shouldn't be able to choke on it."
5,awesome gift @ an even awesomer price,"fairly priced and cheaper than most products like it from other sellersmy two yr old lover themextremely educational - im teaching him shapes, colors, patterns (he replicates what ive built) - hes very precise about placement of things in daily life - these help him learn about balancetimely deliverygreat condition"
5,Great toy,"I bought the Melissa and Doug building blocks for my grandson for Christmas. He loves them and they have become his favorite toy. He learns colors, shapes, and building fun from them. I would buy them again for other grandkids. Thanks"
5,Excellent,es un producto mu lindo para un niño . es muy seguro y no tiene objetos peligrosos. a mi hijo le encasnto
3,A bit disappointed... but overall good quality.,"I was excited to find these blocks as they appeared to be the same as the ones I had growing up. My daughters (age 2 and 5) have been playing with the few that managed to survive my childhood; they love building with them so much that I wanted to add to the fun!Although there are indeed 100 blocks, they are tiny in size. I was highly disappointed when I received the box; the blocks could be bigger and still be easy for little ones to handle (they are no where near the size of regular building blocks).That being said, they are good quality and the girls love them just the same. I would recommend these to anyone~ just keep in mind they are very small."
4,"fun, cute, and fast","i got this within 2 days i think which was awesome, the collors are bright, i got all the parts, it didnt have a bad paint smell (although the paint made some of them stick together), and we all can play with them. i got this with 2 other melissa and doug products and am very happy"
5,Building a future engineer,"I got these blocks at the suggestion of my son's teacher. She said he plays with the school blocks everyday several times a day. My son enjoys them very much although their in competition with some Mega blocks right now. He builds ""houses"" and ""garages"" for his cars and trucks and then loves to show off his creations to me and his Dad! I take pictures of his ""work"" so can see his it long after he has moved on to another building project. The blocks have been great!"
4,"Small shapes, big ideas","I bought these as a gift, and my neighbor boy loved them. I think that a durable container will be needed to store these and maintain parents' sense of organization."
3,changochun05,Beautiful item and easy to put together...the legs of the chair are not as durable as i wouldve predicted but it is a great item. i would recommend it to my friends. my 3 year old loves it and is always playing his cars on it.
4,Works fine with Macintosh computers:,"The reviewer that put it in the drawer just needed to go to the manufacturers website and download the driver that works with Macintosh computers.Once that is done, and it's very easy, this phone performs great! I've had no trouble at all with it and the price is very reasonable. Audio quality is very good. My only compliant is that the cord is probably longer than it needs to be, but better that than being too short."
1,nice 2 pices of junk,"Mini disc not compatible for Macbook, and unable to be recognized by my new MacBook. I put it in a drawer and threw more than US60.oo buying them, Again 2 pieces of junk."
5,Warm and Inspiring,"Calling Me Back to the Wild is a collection of songs that speak to one's heart. Sensuous and nurturing, the lyrics and melodies take you in a journey through the inner workings of life, love, hope... Michael Tomlinson has the virtue of finding beauty in everything and has the ability to perfectly convey his vision through his work."
3,Okay for Elementary School Children,"This is good for elementary school children. It is written at a simplistic level with lots of big pictures and scattered with quizzes. You wouldn't be able to write a thorough report for it, but it provides some decent information on Egypt, Greece, Rome, Aztecs and Incas. Nothing about ancient Asia, Africa, or any other of the early foundations of society and civilization."
4,Double Haunting...,"THE EVIL is a haunted house tale from 1978 concerning a group who encounter a spectre, and release an ancient eeevil in the basement. Richard Crenna (BODY HEAT) and Andrew Prine (GRIZZLY) star, w/ a nice cameo by Victor Buono (WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?, THE MAD BUTCHER). In TWICE DEAD, a family moves into a haunted mansion, and winds up being helped by the ghost in their battle against a ridiculous-looking 80s ""gang""! Todd Bridges makes an appearance as a doomed friend. Loads of 80s fashions and big-big hair! Check out the ""gang"" leader for many good chuckles! This double feature will keep you laughing long into the night..."
3,Pretty Good Roger Corman Double Feature,"This Roger Corman double feature includes 1978's The Evil and 1988's Twice Dead. The Evil is a haunted house flick that's like a cross between The Amityville Horror, House on Haunted Hill, and Legend of Hell House. So basically it's not the most original movie out there, but it's got some cool atmosphere, creepy moments, and some good effects. However, it is slow and I didn't like the ending. I never pictured the devil as being a fat bearded man in a white suit. Twice Dead is better. It's a cool supernatural slasher movie that isn't much of a horror movie for the first hour, but the final twenty minutes are an awesome bloodbath. All in all, this is a pretty good Roger Corman double feature, and you've been collecting these Roger Corman's Cult Classics DVDs, then there is no reason why you shouldn't grab this one too."
5,ESSENTIAL RITCHIE BLACKMORE: 10 STAR RATING!,"This guy's guiar playing has influenced so many young guitar players out there now, that a statue of him in gold somwhere is long overdue! I've been a Deep Purple nut for so many years, and although albums like, In Rock and Burn, have some of his most amazing playing in them, this 1st Rainbow release is his best guitar work in the sense of melody. His playing on Catch The Rainbow and Temple of The King is just beyond words. I love Jimmy Page, Hendrix, Malmsteen, etc., but this guy invented a guiar sound that no one can match. No one was doing the stuff he was back in 1972 even, when Machine Head came out. You also have Ronnie James Dio delivering some killer vocals on this, what more could you want? 10 STAR BLACKMORE RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF POWER METAL, USA. (ANY MALMSTEEN FANS SHOULD HEAR THE INTERVIEW DISC ON HIS RELEASE, INSPIRATION, TO HEAR HIM CONFIRM WHAT I'VE JUST REVIEWED.)"
4,Blackmore and Dio team up to produce a classic rock album,"The first of the rainbow albums, it is not the best work of either dio or blackmore but it has all the elements of a great album. Dio displayes his vocal abilities on Temple of the King and Catch the Rainbow, while blackmore turns out great riffs in Man on the Silver Mountain and the pounding 16th Century Greensleeves. This album is not quite heavy enough to recieve 5 stars but has enough great guitar work, stunning vocals and just plain old good songs to be a must have for any true fan of rock and roll, Esspecially for Dio Fans"
1,Overindulgent trash,"This is garbage! Ritchie Blackmore took himself way too seriously. He left Deep Purple for this? Grown men singing about fairies, kings, dragons and the middleages? For, like, all the songs?""Man on the Silver Mountain"" is a great, classic song (it is also acts as a bait switch...great first song and then all down hill from there). The instrumental at the end is enjoyable since it showcases Blackmore's guitar playing (which is the reason why most people checked this out).This sounds so silly and dated today. Ronnie James Dio's voice was a bad match for this muscular sound.Sorry metal fans, this stinks!"
5,DIO and RITCHIE together!!!,"so, they collide...the guitar master from the legendary heavy rock band DEEP PURPLE, and RONNIE JAMES DIO...The two together create the classic progressive heavy metal band RAINBOW, and this debut is simply brilliant...the hit MAN ON THE SILVER MOUNTAIN, CATCH THE RAINBOW and SNAKECHARMER are pearls!!! All the songs rocks completelly!!Great album, as all the RAINBOW albuns with DIO...If you like Iron Maiden, take a look on Rainbow and see where they got inspiration!!!"
3,Good cd.,Its a good cd but it gets old hearing the songs all sound alike with regards to medevil times of yesteryear.
4,BLACKMORE'S NEW OUTFIT,"First of all, I must need to meake a statement: every one of the four ""Rainbow with Dio"" albuns are much better than anything RAINBOW released after that, mainyl the horrible ""pop metal"" albuns of the Joe Lynn Turner days. Saying that, I must say that this one, their first release, is astonishingly great, its great merit being the fact that each song is very different from the other, withou following the same old path or formula, but at the same time without sounding indulgent. This album is just fantastic !!! By the way, I'd like to congratulate all th reviewers below. THis album seems to have received an unproportional ammount of fantasticly written reviews, all of them are ""killers"" and well written !!"
4,"I'm Not Two, But The Kids Loves It","I bought this for my granddaughter. She just turned two. I figured she'd play with them for two days, and that would be that, but they've kept her interest -- off and on -- more than a week!But I chose them because (1) she likes to put things into boxes, and she likes to put boxes in boxes; (2) these are soft so she won't ""put an eye out"" - not even after her baby brother arrives; (3) THEY DON'T MAKE NOISE.You can't always think entirely of the kid when getting presents. Think of the poor parents! After you're gone and have already taken aspirin, think if you had gotten wood blocks in a house with two floors and a kid who already throws like a center fielder.Hey it was better than clothes, and she does use her imagination. Her ""buildings"" are architecturally better than most of the stuff I've seen go up in metropolitan areas...and more colorful, too."
2,"Ok, but...","I spent some time with Dan Rios (aka Alom Ahau Tze'ec Ba'lam) and he is a sly and wily teacher of the ""Mayan secrets."" Over all the CD is ok. Dik Darnell is a talented musician and like any other CD there are tracks that are much better than others."
1,"Awful, and of all things, silly","I couldn't stand the voice on this recording, and all the songs on it were similar, and kind of embarrassingly silly. Sounded more like Priscilla of the Mayan Desert. I love the Voice of the Four Winds, and thought this would be similar, but it was NOT. Wish I had my money back."
2,Chain was too short,The chain was too short to slide through my large head. I opened up one of the chain links to disconnect the chain and reconnect the chain before I could wear it. Few inch or two extra chain length would have earned higher star reviews.
5,The legend version of Africa Screams is the definitive one.,Long have we suffered through really poor transfers and copies of this Abbott and Costello classic. Since it has fallen into public domain it has suffered form many poor low quality releases. But Legend finally did the movie justice. This by far the best quality version I have ever seen. The Sound is cleaned up and amazing. The Restoration of the B&W version and color version are both amazing. It is bright crisp and clear. I never thought I would ever see the film in such high quality. If you love Abbott and Costello this is a real plus to your collection. Great quality and very low price. I would highly recommend the legend In Color version of this classic.
1,Image Entertainment version is HORRIBLE!!,"Okay I get it... most copies of Africa Screams are terrible, but I was very dissappointed with the Image Entertainment version of this film. True the pre print is from a 35mm original, and it is beautiful, but the film is transfered at a 1.4 ratio speed which shortens the running tme. This print runs only 76 minutes, which is 3 minutes shorter than the original film. It could be that a Euorpean print was used, as these prints alway run a bit shorter than the American print. Due to transfering a PAL coded print to a NTSC will cause a film to run shorter. In fact 4% shorter, 79 minutes X 4% = 3 minutes. Sick to the ROAN version instead."
3,not the best,"It was fun to see them in color and the end is gooood...for once the little fellow is a big winner! But I was expecting more comedy...I was almost bored. I was hoping for something as funny as ""Hold that ghost"" but it was not....from far! It's an OK movie if you're a big fan of the duo."
1,"Dogs, Dogs, Dogs","Ok, this might just be me, but I found this book extremely boring. The author did an OK job on making it bearable for girls, yet I would definitely classify this as a ""boy book."" I found it impossible to enjoy, although guys may like it. I don't like reading about animals. I like reading about people, and how they react to different situations, a position no animal could fulfil. My favorite books are The Phantom of the Opera and A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. If you like those books, you will probably not like this one."
5,"Jimmie Noone's ""Sweet Lorraine"" Is Heavenly","Jimmie Noone's ""Sweet Lorraine"" is heavenly, and is worth the price of this cd, alone. I picked up this disc for a little less than 15 dollars at a Classical and Jazz cd store in MyeongDong, South Korea. I was previously aware of Noone only by name. His playing is fantastic. ""Sweet Sue"" and ""My Daddy Rocks Me With One Steady Roll"" are other fantastic performances on this disc. I highly recommend this cd to anyone interested in early Jazz. Johnny Dodds, Louis Armstrong, and the genius, Jelly Roll Morton, are other essential Jazz artists whom people should discover."
4,when an old secret disturbs your life...,"I regret just one thing : J. Beals isn't always present in this movie, but the story is interesting as something sometimes happens : you see again somebody you loved and it can produce a drama..."
2,I am being generous by giving this product a 2 star reveiw.,"This product was cheap, so I did not expect world class rain gear when I ordered it, but even that did not stop me from being dissapointed. The fit is good, and it is comfortable. It also keeps you dry, until it rips.The first thing that ripped on mine was the the inner button up flap, this happened the second time I wore it. Next, I brushed up against something with the back, and it ripped. Currently the buttons on the sleeve cuffs are starting to rip out. The top flaps on the plastic are starting to rip as well. However, since it is plastic, you can use super glue and scrap plastic to repair holes.It is bright and it fits good, so that is why I gave it 2 stars. It would probably be a great jacket for use by a construction flagger or someone that does not do a lot of movement and physical work. As a tow truck driver, I have to roll around on the ground under cars and do other stuff that causes this coat to not be satisfactory."
1,Warning Warning,"The other review is totally false. This CD is a completely diifferent band than the one founded by John Balance and Peter Christopherson. Instead of experimental music, you will find generic Japanese guitar pop."
4,"A wonderful book, a real page-turner.","Jill Gallagher's boyfriend was killed in a tragic accident, now she must bring his body home to his family in England. There she finds a photograph from the year 1906 of a woman who looks very much like her, then she turns the photograph to find that her name was Kate Gallagher. Jill is shocked, she never knew her family and now she finds this! She knows she has to find out who this woman was no matter what. This book is filled with action and romance, it is so interesting that you will never want to put it down"
2,Not the usual fare.,"I picked up ""The Third Heiress"" because I have always enjoyed Brenda Joyce's works. This book has more of a suspense edge to it; as do a lot of romances now.The problem with The Third Heiress is that the principle characters and their motives were not established early on in the book. One hundred pages into the book, I was still wondering what was going on in the book and why I should care.Going to a fiancee's funeral with his bitter hateful family, seeing a photo with the name ""Kate,"" and her last name on the of it does not make for a compelling mystery or much of a drama. Believe me, I did not stay up all night reading this one. There was no reason to. I did not like any of the characters, or care what happened to them."
2,This broke my heart,"I don't like to read books where the ""good guys"" lose. Kate was such a lively character and in spite of the fact she disappeared nearly 90 years ago, the explanation of how she ""ends"" was horrible! Edward never found happiness and was estranged from the son he should have loved more than life itself. Anne's complete transformation to a hateful woman was hard to believe. Alex falling for Jill was tough to swallow, as she lost control of the car that killed his cousin. Hal's obsession and stalking of Jill was never fully explained. The ending was not only unsatisfying, it didn't bring closure to the ""Kate"" mystery. Pick up another one of Brenda's books to read..."
4,Why not a 5 Star?,"There has been some real bad reviews on this book but I thought it was wonderful! It lost a star from me only because I would have liked the roles of Alex and Thomas reversed. Thomas was far more appealing in a more dangerous and mysterious way, and the chemistry between Thomas and Jill throughout the book was electric. I suspected early on that's where Brenda Joyce was headed and halfway through the book couldn't figure out how to bring the two together because of the family ties. Bummer. I have looked for Thomas's story and can't find it, which is sad because he was quite a man! The only downfall to this book is you cannot put it down...seriously!"
2,Ho hum,"I purchased this book after reading a glowing review of Brenda Joyce's latest release ""House of Dreams"" in People magazine. Rather than spend the money on a hardcover from an unknown (to me) authoress I decided to check out one of her paperbacks first. I am in total agreement with all who have complained about her use of repetitious phrases. I was beginning to feel that if I read the phrase ""Was Alex making a pass"" one more time, that I was going to have to throw the book out the window. And all that business at the beginning of the book with Jill fainting at the drop of a hat was absurd, to say the least. Actually quite a bit of this book was absurd. However ... I haven't given up yet and plan to buy another Brenda Joyce today."
2,the hysterical heiress,"The Third Heiress was a very disappointing book for me. None of the characters including the ghost were particularly likeable. The plot and writing held my interest but the heroine was constantly in hysterics, the hero was a jerk, and any romance between them was totally unbelieveable. I finished the book feeling very unsatisfied."
2,Shaky Start,"Though there is a good story here, the first fourth of the book was mawkish and overwrought, and very repetitive, too. I only kept reading because it was in the car, and I was taking it to places where I had appointments to kill the wait time. Part One could have been cut by 80%, without suffering, and been a lot better read. After that things picked up. The reader knew from the first mention of Kate's disappearance who the likely villain was, and sure enough there was no surprise. I did get very impatient, too, with the heroine wrapping her arms around herself to show her emotion every two or three pages. Less is always more, and it would have been refreshing to have the author be a bit more imaginative on that score. The plot was more imaginative, however; even if too predictable in its outcome."
4,Good....but something was missing,"I have read a few of Ms. Joyce's books and I have to say that the woman knows how to spin a story. The Third Heiress is definitely a great book, BUT while reading it your under the impression that something is missing. I think the missing piece in the book is the romance that builds up between Jill and ALex. The mystery that the book has is superb but the love story seems kind of stilted. As a reader I found that I'd have preferred Jill to have ended up with someone else other than Alex because throughout the novel Jill can never trust in ALex and it makes no sense for her to end up falling in love with him. There is never that connection where you can say this seems like true love between the hero and heroine.Anyway...if you're looking for a romance novel this is not the book for you, but if you want a mystery read the book!! THe mystery is great! You get completely absorbed by Jill's fascination for Kate and her ""quest"" to find out her roots."
4,Couldn't put it down.,"I hate those typical brainless, mushy romance novels that are about sex with a storyline written around it. This book had me hooked from the moment I read the first page. It wasn't ... your typical romance. It intrigued me, and I connected with Jill and Kate instantly. Yes, there are some faults to the book, but it's a great way to spend a rainy day. For those who don't count so well, Jill IS the Third Heir(ess). If Ms. Joyce continues to right in this style, she can be assured of adding another reader to her list."
2,Not In Keeping with Joyce's Usual Excellence,"I commend Ms. Joyce's efforts to shift into a more suspensful and mysterious gear, but for me, it lost the ususal in-depth romance between the characters. Maybe in an effort to write contemporary, Ms. Joyce is adopting today's common philosophy of casual sex between partners who never really get emotionally involved? I missed the communication and emotional turmoil that her characters normally have, and since I'm not much of a mystery fan - the plot that took it's place didn't fill that void. If you prefer a light romance, however, with a suspense twist - this might be more for you. In the meantime, however, I will be re-reading some of Ms. Joyce's classics like The Game and The Conqueror. Those were definitely her best."
1,Jill fainted,"If you're looking for a piffle to while away a couple of days at the beach, this is it. The romance between Jill and Alex isn't romantic. One thing that really irritated me is that Brenda Joyce uses the word ""huge"" to describe just about everything. I also found it annoying how Jill, who lived in a small New York apartment and had very little money, could meet a person and instantly identify Gucci shoes, a Hermes tie, an Armani scarf, etc. How would she know? The subplot about Jill's ancestress, Kate, is simply ridiculous. I felt no sympathy for the young woman being shut up in a tower--she was such an obnoxious character I would gladly have done it myself. It was really stretching it to believe her friend would do this. I never want to read another book by Brenda Joyce."
5,Could not sleep til I finished it,"I could not believe some people wrote bad reviews.... I read 1 book a day (and work full time too- so I chose books that are exciting, romantic and with great suspense with hot love scenes) This book had it all.... The next morning I am still excited, and feeling for the main characters.....that makes a good book.... I feel connected with the main character Jill, watching her grow and feel like I know Kate!!!!! I am disgusted with the villain of the book and get annoyed that he/she got away with things....But it was a great book....you have to read it! Ignore the other reviews....read it you will feel you are a part of the book"
3,Page turner in spite of flaws,"While the story engrossed me, especially the sub plot, there were times when I got so impatient with Jill that I felt like throwing the book down. She did not come across as very smart. Every time she went snooping (which was often), she got caught. She always seemed to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown and drank whenever she got the chance ;-). Hard to imagine how Alex could ever have fallen in love with her! There were a few instances where I felt the plot was stretched too far. The basic plot was great, though, and Anne's betrayal of her best friend, Kate, was well set up. Kate was vividly portrayed, though even by today's standards she was very forward. Not surprising that her life should have come unstuck in the prudish early part of the last century. (I guess Jill inherited her unsmart genes.) I kept hoping she would escape (good suspense here) and that Jill would find justice for her. The end was a bit of an anti-climax."
2,didn't i just read this?,"Okay- I've only read one other novel by Brenda Joyce... House of Dreams. The two plots are, in my opinion, almost EXACTLY alike. This novel is lacking originality and romance. The writing is adequetely written, but I wouldn't recommend this book."
1,New Testament Exegesis: A Handbook for Students and Pastors(3rd Edition),"This book would have been terrific if the publisher would have taken the trouble to check the printing. There is one important section left out and one section repeated. In attempts to contact the publisher for resolution of the mistake, I was directed to an agent who has yet to respond.I hold this author in high esteem and am certainly not holding him responsible for this publishing error, but suggest that he be more careful with selection of a publisher in the future, and use his influence to get this mess straightened out."
2,Big disapointment,I figured this book would be like her other books (the dark and deadly pool etc.) but it wasn't like them at all. It was also very boring and it just dragged on. I wouldn't recommend it
4,Good shoes,I like the T-Mac style that is why I bought these. They are what I wanted and I'm playing basketball better with them.
4,Perfect reflection,"Sole teased us with her beauty and unique voice while appearing on JT Money's Who Dat. When she dropped her own CD she continued to amaze. Her lyrics are real, reminding some of everyday situations. On point beats and not using the usual guest artists help her shine on HER CD. If you are looking for up beat rythms and very clear and real music check this out. Plus the cover aint bad either!"
5,Sole is off the heezy!,"When I purchased Sole I had no idea how slammin' her CD was. I like her style and her beats are nasty! You can't help but, dance. I know people look at me funny when I'm bouncin' in my car but, if they could hear Sole' they would be bouncin' too! I can't believe someone so talented has just came out. I listen to her CD daily especially when I'm gettin' my party on. Good luck Sole' I will look forward to hearing more from you in the future. For all those who don't have this CD you have to get it to listen to it the samples here don't do her justice--Trust Me! A sista who is down wit Sole'I would love to see her in concert."
2,"Man,git you a producer and some beats.","Here's how I'm gonna set it off. I think Sole tha best female rapper,tha only prollem is,she need ta be found.then she might get some money ta hire some1 ta git her betta beats.Her lyrics is good, but tha beats [stink],she needs more beats like on ""Iy Yi Yi"", then she would have dat flow. If, Like me,at first the only track you hear is ""Iy Yi Yi"", then you think that this chick Is HOTT!, but if you hear all the rest,they [stink] cus the beat just ain't cuttin it.So I rated this joint 2 stars, I would give it 2 and a half,but ain't no halves so woo woo.If you planning on gittin this c.d., I wouldn't recommend it,I would git tha single fa ""Iy Yi Yi"", unless you can't find it and you willing ta pay ...fa this piece of junk. Peace,holla back>..."
2,the cd is not the bomb (please stop lying),This cd is okay but it could be better. Her skills [stink] the best thing about the cd is the beats. I hope and pray when she comes back she comes correct.
1,Pass,"How obvious is it that the same person has written multiple ""praise"" reviews for this piece of garbage. Just what we need is another sistah putting out a trashy Lil Kim-like disc. Thank God for Lauren Hill!"
4,"Very nice charm, but concave on the back.","For the price, it would have been nice for it to have been 3-D. It's nice sized and very pretty, but feels a bit flimsy. This is a review, not a complaint. If I had to do it over again, I'd buy this charm...I'd just have been happier to have gotten it at a lower price."
1,Horrid presentation of one of James' least known but most riveting tales,"This is a review of the Kindle version, which appears to be derived from an OCR scan with little in the way of proofreading, correction, or emendation. The indignities perpetrated on this rather gripping yet largely unread tale from James' late middle years (contemporary with The Awkward Age and What Maisie Knew) render this presentation largely unreadable. Instead of evincing wonderment at James' clever marvels of device and artifice, it leaves one, as it were, wincing at such infelicities as the chapter entitled ""I11"" and the passage which informs us ""I fi*f. A""6-who, having heard the last words of the two girl-s,//' c ame, accompanied by the servant, down the - hally"". The Master surely deserves much better."
3,Writers thank teachers,"As I had to give a talk about the influence of good teachers, I readthis book in search of good quotations and anecdotes by writers about teachers who had influenced their careers. It was not thebest source for that, although I still like it that when Kim Novaksaid she had been doing a lot of reading and was asked what, forinstance, she'd been reading? Her response: Mostly poetry and prose. And John Barth chose his own wife as teacher. I thought thebook useful in general but not for a speaker looking for pithy remarks."
5,"Very good for meditation, massage or relaxation","The specific content of this CD is well described under the product and in other reviews. What I could add is that the sound sample is very representative of the content. There is not a lot of variety, which is a good thing for meditation and relaxation depending upon your needs and preferences. When you listen to this for an extended period of time, the sound of the ocean, heart beats, etc. seems to synchronize the bodies rhythms without any effort on the part of the listener. This is CD is well thought out and put together. Highly recommended."
2,"Enough of the beating heart, already","while the music and sounds were indeed (potentially) very relaxing - I found the heartbeat distracting and after a while, downright annoying. Just not my idea of calming."
2,scratches might have helped,"I found a copy of this CD in a thrift shop and decided to check it out. I like the concept of replicating sounds from the womb. As it turns out, I don't like the haunting dolphin sounds - too much like Halloween. It had a few scratches but I knew the disc would play. In this case, any scratches could only have helped and would have just blended in."
1,horrifying,"already mailed review TWICE to costumer service-no response, so here again-THIS CD IS HORRIFYING, CAUSED ME TO HAVE NIGHTMARES AND HEART PALPITATIONS SINCE IT SOUNDS AS IF GHOSTS HOWL AND MOAN, IT WAS SO UNRELAXING AND UNCOMFORTABLE THAT I CANNOT IN GOOD FAITH EVEN GIVE IT HALF A POINT, HOW THIS IS SUPPOSEDLY HEALING AND CREATING GOOD FEELINGS IS WAY BEYOND ME.I WANT MY MONEY BACK AND A CD WITH DOLPHIN/OCEAN SOUNDS THAT TRULY IS HEALING AND RELAXING."
5,"Laugh, laugh, laugh, laugh, and laugh!","Kovalic compiled comics he wrote for the Internet, specifically his own webpage (www.dorktower.com), Interactive Weekly, among other sites, into one fantastic book. Those who have read these comics online will laugh again and again. Those who have yet to enjoy the offerings of Kovalic and his dorky world will enjoy a good laugh about computer problems, game problems, and just trying to live in a world that is frequently stranger than you are."
5,Hauntingly beautiful,"The art technique makes these images truly stick in your memory. The subjects could easily have been made to appear terrifying, but Challenger evokes the spirit of a proud people living their lives in harmony with nature and yet ""living life on the edge"" as well. You can look into the eyes of these images and swear you can understand their trials and joys. Challenger has given life to his art, and that is no small accomplishment."
2,HORRENDOUS is an understatement!,"I really can't begin to explain why this album is so bad. It's really sloppy and hardly original. The only reason it got two stars is because ""Fashion Boy/Fashion Girl"" is on it. I was lucky enough to find it used for a dollar, which is what it's worth to have this song. The song is fun, catchy, and has minimal vocals. Minimal vocals is a plus, since when there ARE vocals on the album, they're bland, tone-deaf, and very annoying (his voice is just too hard to bear). Not to mention that the lyrics are completely mundane. If you can't write good lyrics, PLEASE do us all a favor and alter your voice so we can't understand them. However, I doubt Fuzz has the technology or talent to even do THAT effectively. Please, don't buy this album. If you want interesting and unique techno, check out Mirwais's ""Production,"" the Boom Boom Satellites' ""Out Loud,"" or The Crystal Method's ""Legion of Boom."""
5,"Polish Armies, Winged Hussars and More","""Polish Armies: 1569-1696 (1)"" is the first book in a two-part set. Some of the topics covered in this volume are organization and recruitment, types of cavalry and infantry, armor and weapons, flags, command insignia, and field signs. This book is filled with photographs and illustrations that bring to life this period. Eight full-page artworks depict various uniforms with high attention to detail.The book is very well written, and Polish history is brought to life in words and pictures. Many aspects of this time are concisely described in this volume. After reading this book, you will want to read its second part."
3,Horse Tale,"I've always collected old children's books, especially those about horses and dogs. My mom was always talking about her copy of ""Frog, the Horse that Knew No Master,"" and how much she loved it, so I really wanted a copy of it and was happy to find it here on Amazon. It didn't blow me away with its literary prowess, but it's a cute story, and I love the drawings in my copy."
3,trance2002,"It is a good party CD, but it gets boring and everything seems the same... Try the band Scribe Machine found them at Tower Records, that is a cool band in this style."
1,10 Years in the ?,One of the worst CDs I have purchased this year! I highly recommend you spend your $ on Deep Dish or Erick Morillo.
1,Yick!,"I'm sorry but after having heard so much about him, I had a go and checked this CD out. Terrible. The songs are lame, and there is nothing here that jumps out and grabs me. I was expecting a lot more. He must have friends in high places because talent alone didn't get him where he is today."
1,Same old crap,"His music sucks major big time. It's the same old lame music over and over & same old filter sound. I am very disappointed about this CD. What a rip off!If you got one BT's CD, that's enough. The other CDs all sound the same. Don't waste your money buying his other CDs. They all sound the same. He just can't come up with anything better."
5,By the Shores of Silver Lake,"Once I understood that reading put pictures in my head, I love reading about Laura and Lena riding the horses or the building of the rail road. I read all of the little house books every year to remind me of where my roots are and what is truly important."
5,This book is about a pioneer girl named Laura.,She went thorouh many hardships. While her father was store keeper of a railroad. Her family then was forced to go west for the winter. Laura did not want to go west for the winter. Then they were offered to live in a surveyors house while the surveyor was out for the winter. The house was all supplied because the surveyor thought that they were going to stay there for the winter. They thought that that was a dream house. It had everything they needed. Then everybody started coming to Desmet to get settled and there house was the only place to stay so they started charging people for it. Then Pa had to go and get the claim on there homestead. While he was gone some drunks stayed at there house.
5,By the Shores of Silver Lake CD,Excellent series - am enjoying hearing it this time around as opposed to reading the books the first time around. Makes my daily work commute quite enjoyable.
5,By The Shores of Silver Lake (Little House),I bought this book as a replacement for one that was missing from my collection.
3,The book I would like to be in.,This book is really boring at the beginning but it gets better as you go along.In the middle I just couldn't put it down I was so into it I couldn't belive it .I would reccommend this book to any of my friends who read stories from the pioneer days.
5,A really great book!,"When the book starts out, Laura's aunt comes, and Pa decides to move. Laura is 13. I really like this book because Laura puts detail in what pioneer life was like. It is a well-written book. You just can't miss a book like this."
5,By The Shores Of Silver Lake,"This book is by Laura Ingalls Wilder. The story is about Laura, her older sister Mary, her two little sisters Carrie and Grace, and Ma and Pa, who are their mom and dad. They move from one place to the next. The setting is 19th century trail and shows a lot of trees, wagons, and people too.One of the main events is when Mary, Carrie, Grace and Ma get Scarlet Fever and Mary went blind. Another is when Jack was their dog and he died of old age.The author is telling about her life when she was a little girl. She is Laura. I think my favorite part of the book is when Laura and Lena were riding horses in Lena's backyard. The book starts when Mary goes blind. Some of it is sad, some of it is happy, and some of it is just right. I think everyone could like this book if they really wanted to.- Emma,9"
3,There's only one good movie on this disc,"And that's William Malone's Creature, starring Klaus Kinski. That one's pretty cheesey too. The other movie is this 1950s Sci-Fi called The Slime People, and if you ask me, it's quite the borefest. I just got through watching that.The disc itself is not gonna get any awards either. Both look like they've been sourced from old VHS tapes. Also, when you watch Creature, during the end credits, the disc just simply freezes.UPDATE: I ended up getting the Diamond Entertainment DVD in June and I ended up trading this DVD here off a few weeks ago."
2,Good movies......very bad quality picture and sound,"The Slime People has always been one of those favorites of mine. I was excited to be able to get it on DVD format. Unfortunately, the transfer of the original to DVD has been done so badly, that the film is nearly unwatchable. And the sound is warbly to say the least. Perhaps they simply had a bad original to work with. It is still fun to watch though....just not very well preserved.Creature was transferred with about the same disregard for getting a decent quality of picture recorded on the DVD format. It's a shame that two fun movies were recorded this badly.I'd recommend this DVD for anyone who likes old flicks, The Slime People is one of the classics of low-budget B&W California sci-fi. Just don't expect to see high quality video or hear decent sound because the thing was recorded very badly."
5,vol. one Alien,I have the video of creature and I wanted the dvd of the movie. It is good. the slime People is a classic and much older and becoming a much hard to find movie. I am happy with this dvd.I purchased this product through Amazon
3,Buy it for the Alien-rip off Creature,I only bought this to get Creature with Klaus Kinsky. It's an average Alien rip-off with some nasty Alien feeding scenes. The acting for some is really bad.Creature:+ Hard to get on DVD+ Klaus Kinsky is really is awesome at times- Poor poor picture quality (straight from a VHS rip)- Poor sound quality.Buy it only if you like some really cheesy acting and suspense.
1,Banal drudgery,"Ignore the undeserving pseudointellectual hype surrounding this book. It is nothing but a displeasureable collection of banal observations and anecdotes, not the dark comedy which others profess it to be."
4,There's only one Celine.,In style this is similar to Journey to the End of the Night. It has the same angry-hurt tone but is concerned with his youth. Because of that it hits the perfect tone. I don't think it's as powerful as his first book but it's still worth reading. I think the second half of the book is better than the first perhaps because the author sounds less self pitying.
3,Impress Your Coffee-Shop Acquaintances,"Tortuous, fractured, treacherous. Occasionally frustrating, as when adults (parents, employers, teachers) deride him for pages on end, plumbing the depths of their vocabularies for colorful insults. Not mandatory reading like ""Journey to the End of the Night"" was, I still have to give Louis-Ferdinand credit for writing a 600-page novel where virtually every sentence ends in an ellipsis."
5,The lynch pin of modern literature,"I discovered this novel back in 1986. I have read it at least five times since then. It still retains its impact. A far better book than ""Journey to the End of the Night."""
5,Black comedy and nihilism at its best,"A tougher read than Journey to the End of the Night, Death on the Installment Plan is nonetheless a wonderful example of the essence of Celine. The portrait of the young Fernand's childhood in working-class Paris slums is shattering in its filth and despair, but one gets the feeling that the wily young scamp likes it that way. Death on the Installment Plan approaches the pain of sexual awakening, the struggle to make a living, and the need to leave a mark with a sly wink - after all, as the author subtly reminds us, the slate is wiped clean in the end"
5,You will only like this book...if you're a genuis(sic).,"Giant women in skirts swallowing up the suburbs as entire neighborhoods roll into a giant avalanche orgy...A father who arouses more loathing in you than you've ever had for your own...An artist's accurate portrayal of work as a machination for the strong to suppress, and humiliate the weak (dot, dot, dot) Sex exposed as a visceral, ego-driven and disgusting exercise...A disheveled and erratic scientist who fritters away everything on the ponies...A purity of maternal devotion expressed for a school teacher...Being lost in a sea of pupils, peers, co-workers, idiots, prostitutes, family..."
5,A wonderful Original Album from Jose,"I had the original LP album many decades ago and particularly loved the instrumentals on this album. Whether you are a fan of Jose or not, I think you will find that this is a very special collection of music that at least will turn someone unfamiliar with Jose into a fan and bring back wonderful memories while making new one for greying fan like myself."
4,"Not their best, but still great","This is not the best album by the Whitlams, and there is no real standout song like the brilliant 'No Aphrodisiac'. However, it is the type of album that if you play it a few times, it gets under your skin. The song about Kate Kelly is one that you are sure to find yourself singing along to.If you haven't encountered the Whitlams before, i suggest you get their first album before having a go at this one. You will probably appreciate it more after hearing their earlier work.(ps: and they are amazing live - saw them in a small venue on a skiing weekend. We didn't know they would be there, but i am so glad they were!)"
4,walk the line,loved j phoneix and reese in this movie. i expected nothing but it is one of my favorite love stories and the singing is terrific
2,A Little Mix-up,"I did purchase ""Bach and the Italian Influence"", but when the item arrived it was ""Bach and the French Influence"". I called Amazon and was told they would have the correct CD to me the following day. However, again, I received ""Bach and the French Influence"". I called Amazon again. By no fault of Amazon, the item had been packaged incorrectly and I received a full refund of the item. I must admit that the service and demonstrated professionalism by Amazon is unmatched. Again, by no fault of Amazon, there was a mix-up but, by the great lengths taken by Amazon to remedy the situation, I am still a satisfied customer."
1,Complete garbage,"The flosser never worked properly from the moment it arrived. The installed battery had badly corroded, and, despite cleaning the contacts with alcohol and installing a new battery, it still would not function."
1,Oral Hummingbird Power Flosser,The item only worked for 1 week. When I opened it up the battery was corroded and I eas unable to get it to work.
4,Helpful tool after shoulder surgery,"I got this for my husband who had rotator cuff surgery a couple of weeks ago and will be unable to use one arm for a while, but is anxious to keep up with flossing. He's quite happy with it -- he's been using the pick attachment and says it's not quite as good as regular flossing but very close. The y-shaped flosser attachment would probably work better, but neither of us has ever been able to negotiate one of those even by hand, never mind electric-powered. I haven't tried it myself but would like to give it a shot, since like many here, I hate flossing!"
1,bad stuff,The item i bought did not work the battery had leaked inside the package. The troubling part is that the person who packed the item could see this and sent it to me anyway. Other than that i like the product ( I already had one) this one was a stocking stuffer that did not make it to the stocking. I would like another one sent to me (one that works).
2,very small and hard to handle.,"It seemed like it might be a great product, but I bought it for my mom whom has a hard time handling those little disposible flossers. I wasn't expecting to be so little and it doesn't really work for her. She dropped it one of our dogs got it,it was barely damaged and would not work anymore at all. They only chewed the disposible part. It shouldn't of broke so easy. Also the button is hard to push."
2,Ordering logistics went perfect! But...,"Only one of the two flossers that I ordered worked. The battery exploded in one of the units, and the other flosser is not up to speed...runs very slow. Tried new batteries but that didn't help. However, these flossers are the best when you can find one that works 100%."
1,corroded and defective,"This device arrived with it's battery and wires caked with corrosion. Obviously it had been standing around for a long time without use. It failed after a week. I cleaned out the junk and replaced the battery. It now seem to work, but I don't know for how long."
3,Bought it for travel only,"I have a oxyfresh water pic which is probably the best in the market. But I travel quite a bit and this is ideal for travel. Oral B always makes good products. I thought I was getting a floss refill pack but instead I got a pik refill set, no big deal. This is no replacement for a real water Pik but perfect for on the go or in the car between stoplights."
1,I had one before and loved it this one only worked a week.,if could be gotten locally i would recommend it. On line the one I got was a bad deal and too much work trying to retrn or fix.
2,SMALL KEYS,"THE BLACKBERRY CURVE WAS SMALLER AND LIGHTER THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS. THE KEYS WERE TOO SMALL AND HARD TO READ. I RETURNED IT! ALSO, THE FIRST BILL FROM AT&T WAS AROUND $160. GLAD I DID NOT HAVE TO PAY IT!!!"
1,Wasn't what title said.,Interesting history lesson. But no teeth or author gives no insightful understanding of scripture and why god would want us to be rich.
1,Dreadful,"The author wrote an interesting book on economics and technology long ago. It was published in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Then he became a tiresome and annoying fundamentalist. Since then he has written nothing worth reading. A friend gave me his copy of this title after losing interest in it by the third chapter. I managed to read the entire book on a plane ride. Unfortunately, it was the only reading material I had.If god wants you to be rich, it appears that he hates 95% of humanity because it's poor.Don't waste your time and money on this tiresome religious propaganda.Here's a far better alternative: Randy Gage's Why You're Dumb, Sick, and Broke."
1,Warmed over material and Misleading Title,"I bought two of Paul's books on the strength of ... reviews and I have to say that both were hugely disappointing and a complete waste of money and time. This guy has a knack for recycling widely published material (I mean books, magazines, television, you name it) and packaging it in a way that is decidedly NOT entertaining or engaging. This book is not about how God wants you to be rich and there's nothing in here about how you can enjoy material and spiritual wealth. It's Paul's explaination of how technology drives growth in a free market economy along with copious supporting evidence, prescriptions for changes in government policy, etc. While I agree with much of what he says, its nothing new and, frankly, he doesn't write very well. Life is short: Don't waste it on bad books."
2,"Good Economics, Bad Theology","It is obvious that the author is more economist than theologian. His economic thinking is sound and inspiring, but his theological reasoning is terrible! His reduction of the Abrahamic Covenant in the Bible to material prosperity is stupid. If God promised economic prosperity to Abraham and everyone with faith, Jesus Christ himself must have overlooked it; Jesus wasn't rich in material goods. The blessing promised to Abraham and people of faith is primarily spiritual and can include but doesn't have to include material wealth. To claim the Bible teaches that ""God wants you rich"" is an insult to all the godly men and women through the ages who weren't rich -- and those today who aren't. This book will sell in prosperous U.S.A but that doesn't mean it's basic premise is correct. Again, his economics is sound, but he needs to take a few courses in theology before he attempts to use the Bible to ""prove"" that ""God wants you rich."""
1,Scattered thoughts that lead one through a maze....,I read this book and found that it was confusing. It failed to support its theories adequately and has very little application in today's world.Very disappointing... I introduced it to my reader's group and the disappointment was unanimous.A pity.
2,I wonder what Jesus would have said...,"If you are poor, you will go to hell. This, in frank terms, is the essence of this book's ""Theology"", when all the feel-good, new-age ""prosperity talk"" is stripped to its essentials. God wants you to be rich; therefore, if you are not rich, you are violating God's will. You are rejecting God's gift, ""prosperity for everyone"". You are, quite literally, a sinner.Of course, being a middle class American - that is, immensly rich by the economic standards of most of the world even today, to say nothing of biblical times - is not enough to clear you of the awful sin of ""not being rich"". When the author speaks of being rich, he means rich by *American* standards. To go to heaven, you must own a Lear Jet, or at least a large Yacht.I just wonder what Jesus, the apostoles, St. Paul, the Virgin Mary, and the early christians, 99% of whom were dirt poor, would have said about this book."
4,A moral defense of wealth.,"Paul Zane Pilzer lays out a moral defense of why everyone should aim to become wealthy without feeling guilty. And in fact, he challenges us to forget that 1970's mentality of scarcity and look at the future of abundance. Read it to prepare for the 21st century."
4,Excellent!,The book basically takes you through the history of the US economy and economic thinking at various stages through our history. Mr. Pilzer points out that consumers never become satisfied as was predicted in the 30's and 40's. Advancing technology always stays one step ahead of man and provides him with new and improved products which may be considered a luxury at first but will quickly become a necessity in our ever changing society. He also points out very effectively that technology is changing our society at an ever increasing rate. This is forcing us to abandon the practice of working for the same company for an entire lifetime. Changes in technology are constantly creating new industries which forces us to acquire new skills to remain employed.
5,Excellent book! Must reading for those who want more of it.,"Well, I must tell you that my group of eight CEO's read it and we all unanimously agree it is well worth reading! And I personally must disagree with the previous comment. This book in insightful on just how money works. It also brings into play how God, has brought forth incredible wealth. Pilzer's books are thought provoking and enlightening. A very good book with a shift in perception!!!"
3,Disappointed,"This book relates to the Luftwaffe actions on the east front in 1944-45, and more specifically the use of fighters.The book is well done in the sense that you see actual pictures and the corresponding profiles of some of the planes.If you are interested in everything that is related to German fighters in the East in 44-45, this book is a must have as it has some original pictures well worth seeing. However, you won't get a comprehensive view on the topic of German fighters in the East, but rather a sum of rehashed documents that already exist in other books.If you want a mid level comprehensive book on German fighters in 44-45 on the east front with lots of profiles, you will be left disappointed."
4,"Great plays, of course; reasonable edition","I'm not going to attempt to review the Tamburlaine plays, except to say that if you enjoy Shakespeare and haven't read Marlowe, get started. I love these plays.The quality of this edition of the plays, however, is worth describing. I purchased this edition for my students in an Honors High-School English class. It's a reasonable edition to teach with. The footnotes do a good job of identifying and explaining the concepts and terms my students weren't familiar with, and thankfully they are on the bottom of each page, rather than at the end of the book (which very few students will bother to turn to). The introductory material is OK, but not fabulous; if you want your students do to any serious background reading, you'll probably be making photocopies of other sources.The price was right, and the edition was fine for the classroom; I'd probably buy this edition again for students."
1,My bettas don't like it,"I tried this product because of the positive reviews. The first time I gave these bloodworms to my bettas, one of them tried one, spit it out and ignored the others floating at the top of the tank; and the other betta swam by, investigated them, and ignored them. I tried giving my bettas the bloodworms two more times with the same results. I tried giving them the bloodworms at dinner time before feeding them their regular dinner, so appetite wasn't the issue. I checked the expiration date, and I'm years away from getting close to it. My bettas just didn't find these bloodworms appetizing. I don't know whether my bettas are unique in this respect, but I somehow doubt it. One betta, maybe, but not two."
4,Tetra Bloodworms,Purchased these for our fish because I had been unsuccessful in finding them locally. Our fighting fish seem to enjoy them as a treat every now and than.
2,no go,my betta didn't like at all....he just looked at it and swam away....i fed it to the gold fish in my pond...they eat anything and they weren't impressed either.
5,African Cichlids Love It!,"This was an add-on item and I thought my cichlids would love it - and they do. I have had the same fish for years and they love the Tetra Colorbits, but this was a nice different treat for them. I throw in a little every now and then with their regular fare."
4,My Betta Loves This Stuff,I bought this mainly to add variety to my Betta fish's diet. The fish love to eat this and it does not seem to cloud or otherwise pollute his water. The worms are a bit small and hard to feed to your fish. Also some people have reported allergic reactions (there is a warning on the product about this as well) so keep it away from small children. The container has a child safety lid which can be a bit frustrating for some. Other than that this is a great product that your Betta will love.
3,What happened?,"Would give a better rating if my Betta would enjoy them... he ate them like crazy when I first fed them to him, but not anymore... he just turns away and lets these little worms just float on top of the water... so not sure what happened, but disappointed that my Betta doesn't like them anymore..."
4,Blood worms,These were useful in feeding my African Dwarf frog. He did not like to eat the frozen ones.The major difference was that these floated and I was able to crush them up a bit. I read thewarning on the back about allergens and I guess I am lucky not to have that issue. My frogrefused to eat anything else and these were a huge lifesaver literally.My tank contains a few tetra's and some guppies as well as some other small ones that lookedcute. I have seen no adverse reaction to these fish in regards to the blood worms. But I haveonly been feeding them it for a little over a month.I also fed them to one of my beta's. He did love it. It was fantastic I have to say. I agreewith the comments before mine that this would probably not be a good idea for daily feeding.My fish will eat a worm and continually float for an hour or so after looking bloated. Ifound that feeding him one worm a day avoided this.
2,Swing? Where?,"Well, I hate to spoil the party, but I found this CD disapointing at best.The bands are certainly Big, but they sure aren't swinging. I love swing--but it ain't here.The sound is flat, flat, flat, as if the bands played at one end of a huge warehouse and the microphone was set up at the opposite end. Most of the performances are a few beats too slow, and the soloists sound uniformly tired.On the other hand, the cover art is repugnant."
4,Great swing CD.,"This is a wonderful jazz CD. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that many of the songs came from the same era, and therefore sound very, very similar in style, tempo, etc. But I definately reccomend it."
4,A great CD,my whole life (I'm now 14) I have loved this CD it is great for passing long car rides because I know all the lyrics by heart.
2,just slightly disappointed,"This band's awesome ""Breakbeat Science Excercise 6"" is what encouraged me to buy this disc. I love the artwork on the disc itself. However, I live continous DnB mixes, and this had segregated songs. You can tell the duo is trying to branch into new genres, or at least not do just typical DnB. However, since I was in a pure DnB mood with them, I was disappointed. Don't get me wrong: I don't hate this disc. It just wasn't heavenly like J. Magik or ""Safari"" by Bad Company or many Diesel Boy discs. There are some tracks that keep it true to the genre. Those were great."
5,It keep me interested all the way to the very end.,I have read every one of LaVyrle Spencer books. This book as all of the books LaVyrle has written are never boreing. Some times I actually get so caught up in the story I find my self reading into the late hours of the night She is an excellent author and you will never go wrong by reading any of her books.
3,Not bad...,"This has a good feeling of the time (1950) and place (Minnesota) it's set in. Emotionally it goes straight to your heart without asking too much of you. I enjoyed it, but it doesn't inspire me to read any of the author's other books."
2,Informational and imaginative but not captivating,"The detailed description of convent living in the 1950s was informative and educational. Curiosity alone should encourage people to buy this book. But for the true romantic, it might be a disappointment. I felt as if Spencer was holding back in developing this romance in order remain respectful. With this purpose in mind, perhaps the subject was too close to heart."
3,I think this book was missing something.,"I enjoyed this book as I did Spencer's previous books, but I feel that this one was lacking something. I don't think the story moved fast enough in the first few chapters. I was wondering when she was going to get around to the point. Once she did, I was not at all disappointed, but for the first time I truly had a hard time getting into the book. As for whether this is truly her last book or not, I guess we'll just have to wait and see. Can you retire from writing like you retire from accounting or law?"
3,You must be Catholic to enjoy this one!,"I could not get past everything that I didn't know about the Catholic religion to enjoy the romance in this book. Ms. Spencer has given us so many great romances that I would recommend before this one. ""Family Blessings"" and Hummingbird"" being two of the best!"
5,Great read,Glad to have found a book of this author that I had never read before. Enjoyed it so very much
5,"book ""Then Came Heaven""",A good book at a great price as a gift for a friend. We enjoyed the book and expect her to also.
3,SMALL TOWN SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE LAST BOOK,This book had too many unrealistic plots. Yes nuns left the convent in the 50's but I don't think it would have been as easy as it was portrait in the book. I don't think the small town would have let her get away with marrying someone in their town and think it was ok. Small towns today would have a problem with this also. If it had been any other situation this probably would have flowed. I still enjoyed the book.I have read all of Lavyrle's books. I am sorry that this is the last one. I will miss her. I have all the tapes to the book so I will continue to hear her. My husband enjoys her also.
2,Didn't really cut it,"This is the only LaVyrle Spencer book that I was ever unable to finish! I tried several times to become engaged in the story (a nun falling in love with a father, etc., seems like it would be engaging enough!!), but always found myself putting the book down and forgetting about it. I think a Spencer fan should attempt this book, as others seem to like it, but should probably already enjoy the author before they try it. The only reason I did not give it 1 Star is because I respect the author and her attempt too much for that."
5,A great and touching book.,"I have very few comments to add to what has already been said in previous reviews. This book had be glued to the pages. Ms. Spencer paints a picture with words. Its almost like being there and watching each scene unfold.I discussed this book with a friend of mine, an ex-nun, and she told me the life of a nun, as described by Ms. Spencer, is very true.This cannot be Ms. Spencer's last book! I doubt if her fans will allow it."
5,"ROMANTIC, INNOCENT, WONDERFUL","Set in the 1950's a young father becomes a widow, at the same time a young catholic nun is questioning the life she finds herself living... Lavrle Spencer has written a beautiful story, with likable characters. The way these two people realize that life can go on and an be just as wonderful after the loss of something you cherish can inspire anyone. Eddie has lost his wife and Sister Regina has lost her life as she has known it. When they finally come together you feel the innocence, the romance and the wonder of falling in love."
5,"""Then Came Heaven"" an absolute delight","I've read this book multiple times, but keep losing it, so I bought another copy through Amazon. It's a gentle story of death and the life of the deceased loved ones' that followed. LaVyrle Spencer weaves reality into her stories. She always leaves me wanting more!"
3,Nice easy book,"Nice easy book to read. Good discussion in our book club. Not a meaty book, but good for a fast read."
2,Not My Kind of Book,"When I was a teenager, I read a lot of romance novels. Now that I'm an adult, I've put away the things of a child. I read this book only because it was in a box of discards my sister sent me.Why would a nun want to marry a janitor? I suppose that question smacks of snobbishness. So be it. The question is never raised in the book, and so it is never answered, but I'm still wondering.If my memory serves me correctly, this town had 400 people and two Catholic churches. That is really hard to believe. The Catholic church I attended as a child had at least 200 people at each of 6 Sunday services; thus, it served at least 1200 people. One Catholic church would have been more than adequate for all the people in the novel's town, even if everyone was Catholic."
3,"Misleading DVD title & package art. Should be"" The Best of Laurel OR Hardy""","***2013 update*** Amazon is confusing reviews by combining reviews for different products. This is NOT for the 1968 feature just released, it is for an older collection of Laurel & Hardy solo shorts***This DVD is designed to mis-lead buyers. First the title of the DVD implies they are a team as ""Laurel & Hardy"", but this is their solo work. Then they use a picture of Laurel & Hardy from around 1935 when they were a team in their top form, but these shorts are 10 to 20 years earlier when both were refining their screen personas.This is hardly the ""Best of Laurel & Hardy"", it is more like a study of Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy's solo work."
1,"Junk case, poorly designed","Don't buy Krussel cases.Krussel will not honor their guarantee.Emailed Krussel twice, got no response from them; called their main office in Europe. Said claims were handled by people in Asia.=lots of non help.They are bums and don't seem to care about customers after they have your $$.Stiching tears out with light use and they will not honor their warantee.Don't do business with Krussel. You will regret it."
3,Could be better.,"I ordered this to replace an older one of supposedly the same type, but the newer one is not as good as the old one was (before the snap closure broke). The extension that allows the two halves of the phone cover to separate does not retract correctly when the phone is opened, the old one always worked, and the new case does not allow as easy an access to the charging socket as the old one.Still OK as a case to protect the phone though."
2,"Beautiful, but does have design flaws.","This case is beautifully crafted and very well made. But it does definitely have some serious design flaws. The opening to access the charging port is on the WRONG SIDE OF THE PHONE. So you have to remove the case to recharge the phone. Also, the flap that goes over the flip portion of the phone obsures the camera lens (But don't they all?) and is so tight that it holds the flip constantly open. Within an hour of receiving this item, I had cut off the flip cover with a pair of scissors. Hated doing that, but the last two complaints were then fully eliminated immediately. The strap that covers the key pad still holds the phone in the case securely. And, actually, I think it even looks better without the beauty of the phone being obscured by the case flap."
3,Another good book by Duras about an alcoholic in a café,"Similar in some ways to ""10:30 on a Summer Night,"" this book is about an alcoholic woman taking her son to piano lessons and on the way home she develops an odd relationship with a stranger in a café where a man has just killed his lover. As with many of Duras' books, one shouldn't expect to the affair to culminate in physical love or if it does, it probably won't be particulary pleasant or satisfying. For those looking for a realistic story where things don't necessarily go right, I recommend this book along with ""10:30 on a Summer Night,"" also written by Duras."
5,rayjoy@ipa.net Ray J Sonnier,"Kenn Miller is a very good writer.My intrest was kept at a peak all the way through the book. Although I had to pay more for an out of print book, I didn't mind paying more. The book was well worth the extra cost. Roadrunner6 Out"
3,An old dog doing a new trick,"A clever rewrite of the old ""how to be a writer"" advice book, except the focus is on leveraging the Internet. There are some useful tips and a resources for the neophyte, but for established writers or online journalists (i.e. people who have gone to Journalism School and earned a degree in Journalism and are now working in an on-line medium) this book's usefulness is limited."
2,Cards fan lost shine,"I was really excited to get my ring and it was beautiful. But it has lost it's shine, turned gray and I don't know how to get it back to original shine."
3,rare cartoons on tv,"I like this product but dic 4 that is 6 hour long it has various cartoons on it snuffy smith & barney google; blondie & dagwood, betty boop & hagar the horrible the entire tape has only snuffy smith; one betty boop and one hagar the horrible and 2 blondie & dagwood. on disc 5a & 5b they have other various cartoons but the same cartoons are also on disc # 2 and they have the nerve to charge $11.99 for this showing duplicate cartoons on the other disc. The dvd picture is very clear.Letitia FyfieldBoston, Massachusetts"
4,a good record by Steve Vai,"This album contains two true gems 'The boys from Seattle' (which sounds very hendrixian - and in a beautiful way, without being pompous, this is one of the finest songs i have heard for a while, a sort of breath of fresh air into the current mediocrity of the music scene, had Jimi written this one, it would have been considered as one of his better songs) and 'tender surrender'; i'm less a fanatic of the heavy distorted stuff - though 'Die to Live' is very pleasant - of the rest of the record but i must admit there is an excellent guitar playing throughout the album, and this goes beyond just being a shred player, there is a lot a subtlety and work throughout (the progressive complex metal piece Kill the guy with the ball/The god eaters which ends with subtle harmonics); i don't regret my purchase, the thing that the record is short is not a problem for me, quality is always over quantity."
4,"Some Genius, Some OK","One thing that I love about Steve Vai is that he rarely resorts to making a song out of drums, a repeating bass line, and a guitar solo a la Yngwie Malmsteen, but keeps the melody through his songs. He has just the right amount of solo in his music, which is shown in this CD.Alien Love Secrets has three AMAZING songs, Bad Horsie, Juice, and Tender Surrender. Tender Surrender perfectly builds tension and lets it all go in a second, perfectly. The Boy from Seattle and Kill the Guy with the Ball are both solid songs also.Die to Live random at times, and I didn't much care for it. Ya-Yo Gakk is funny the first time you hear it, but gets annoying thereafter.I would recommend this CD. It certainly has some 1st class music on it, and my three favorite Steve Vai songs."
4,Worth picking up...,"If you're a died-in-the-wool Vai fan you should pick this one up. There's only one extra track, and it may not be for all, but it's interesting, lighter than most rock guitar material, and more than enjoyable once gotten used to. Incidentally, the name of the extra track is in Japanese and translates to ""three, three, seven rythm"", which explains what the handclaps are doing... Still, the most compelling reasons for me to buy this album would be Bad Horsie and Tender Surrender, both of which are more than worth the purchase of the disc. If you want to see Steve playing these cuts, definitely buy the DVD by this same title. Quite entertaining, and good study for all you guitarists out there!"
4,Alien Never sounded so good!,Received my CD and am enjoying it lots. Saw Bad Horsie on YouTube and it just Rocks!! His YaYoGak with his son is cool as well.
3,Good,"Good, but if you wanna hear someone who can play like hell and translates this capability into hearable and authentic great tunes, buy Eric Johnson."
4,A good over CD....with only 7 songs!,"I bought this after hearing tender surrender and bad horsie. While a little supprised that it only has 7 songs I was pretty much blown away. Every song on here is great with the exception of ""ya-yo gakk"" which is one of Steve's sons sayin ya-yo gakk and squeeling over and over. Some people think its funny, I think its nerve racking. Bad horsie is really good. It was inspired by Steve's crossroads riff. Juice is amazing. Its so fast and amazing, I thought Steve's guitar would catch on fire! Die to live makes me wonder if Steve is really from Earth. Boy from Seattle is a beautiful tribute to Jimi Hendrix. Then theirs the 7th song, Tender surrender. It starts off slow then really speads up whith fast scales amazing riffs. This album was recorded in the middle of fire garden's recording. He did this as a ""I don't care what the cridics think about it cause thiws is my feelings played on guitar"" type album. Final grade: A-"
3,for Vai's fans only,"strictly for hardcore fans.If you are not, and you see it for $4.99, fine, otherwise skip it. Get the 7th song, or some other anthology or compilation."
3,A rocking good time!,"A rocking good time, but redeemingly minimal musical value...well, except for Juice and maybe Tender Surrender."
2,A DISAPPOINTMENT,"Steve Vai is a terrific guitarist, a virtuoso. But this album left me unfulfilled. Not only is this a short album, most of these tunes are sloppy and inconsistent. ""Die to Live"" and ""Kill the Guy WIth the Ball"" are cool jams, but that's it. If you want to buy a Steve Vai album, get ""Passion and Warfare,"" which is amazing. But on ""Alien Love Secrets,"" Vai doesn't know if he wants to be a rock guitarist or a metalhead. Pass on this one."
1,Not the greatest Vai,"I didn't buy the CD - I bought the DVD, which is just a studio shot of the band playing. The track Ya Yo Gakk was funny the first time, and only for a few minutes (this song features kids I'm assuming are Vai's). The only track I really liked was Boy from Seattle - but I wouldn't say it is worth the buy. Flex-Able is a great one though"
3,"Half excellent, half bad","I love Steve Vai's music, don't get me wrong but this a bit patchy. Bad Horsie is just a generic sqealling rock tune, Ya Go Gakk is a novelty record with his child sqealing on it, (it gets annoying very quickly), and the travesty that is Kill the Guy With The Ball... that has to be his worst ever song. It's so repetitite and tuneless and after 2 minutes you want to throw the stereo through the window. Not good at all.The other songs are fantastic, Juice is like Satriani's Satch Boogie, Die to Live is just amazing, it's hard to describe but it has a serious tone, great. The Boy From Seattle is a funky tune which is mint and the last song, Tender Surrender is nearly a masterpiece, it just gets ruined at the end by some weird nosies.All in all, buy Passion n' Warfare first, then Fire Garden. If you have a fiver spare, buy this if it's in a bargain bin. I think I paid 4.99 for it and that's all it's worth really. Good in parts but severly let down by weirdness. A big shame."
3,"Good, but maybe not essential stuff...","To me, Paul Jones was the finest vocalist of the 60's British invasion period. His signature moment of being the vocalist for ""Do Wah Diddy Diddy"" and other early Manfred Mann hits was perhaps also a curse; it caused many to overlook his great efforts on MM's jazz and blues tinged LP tracks. The band stayed close to their blues roots and (along with Georgie Fame) was one of the first invasion bands to foray into jazz.Jones, in his solo career, veered more into the pop field, albeit in his own style, and basically disappeared from the US scene after the soundtrack ""Privilege."" His material of that period was supported by orchestras and horn sections and therefore hued closer to acts like David and Jonathan and Jonathan King, and so on. For the best of that, I would refer you to Volume One of this series. Not that this is a bad CD, it's just that fledgling Paul Jones fans would be better to start with the earlier stuff."
4,Major new edition of Catullus should become standard,"Thomson's edition of Catullus finally weds a commentary to his twenty-odd year old critical text. For the scholar of neoteric poetry, Thomson's book is a must; undergraduates will find it too vast and too unconcerned with elementary matters (also with literary matters) but very helpful for bibliography on each poem (a role Quinn's text was growing a bit long in the tooth for). Graduate students are compelled to use this as their standard text. Thomson is at his best when unraveling the often diffuse manuscript tradition of this often-read, little-understood poet. For classicists with only a passing interest in Catullus and his work, Fordyce (supplemented by Quinn for the ""obscene"" poems) remains more than usable."
2,Pass on this one,Radio station in-house recordings can be hit or miss. The Mountain and others have some really great productions. I wish I had passed on this one. The selections are poor with no production quality.
4,Powerful yet Compact,The fan works great. There is much more power than you would expect from a small fan. I have had Honeywell fans in the past and they hold up well. That is the reason I chose to get another one.
4,FAN of the fan,"great item...very inexpensive....easy to use, and very lightweight. I can carry it anywhere. Fan gives a powerful air flow that I need at my gigs. I am very pleased with my purchase..."
1,Pathetic,"This 8-inch fan produces 75% the airflow and 200% of the noise of a standard 12-inch fan. The control nob is poorly located behind and on top of the motor: changing speeds or turning the fan on/of results in the fan rotating up, requiring constant readjustment. I would seriously question acquiring this fan even if it were free.This fan is made by Kaz, which paid to use Honeywell's name. Honeywell makes money by doing nothing, and Kaz makes money by doing very little. I assume any positive reviewers are grateful that they can get anything at all from corporations for their money."
1,Awful!,"This fan is awful! I have one and can't stand it. It gets dirty, then blows dirty air and it is very noisy. What I hate most about it is that it does not circulate the cool air. It just blows the air, which doesn't do anything to get cooler."
2,"Moves air fine, but has built in self destruct","I bought two of these fans 3 months ago and both are already starting fail. While they may be noisy to begin with, they're both already out of balance and vibrate for about 2 minutes before they settle down. They are beyond loud while this occurs and I suspect that I will only have to replace them as it gets worse as each day passes. The HT800 is cheaply made and is too loud to use while you sleep. Avoid this fan."
3,Loud and won't hold still,"Very powerful, very loud and it just won't keep the position when placed facing straight to the front, the fan will always drop back a notch and start venting up."
2,Extremely Loud,This fan is extremely loud even at that lowest setting. Not good if you are trying to use this in the bedroom....I would not recommend this and am returning it today.
1,AGREE WITH CRESPIN PIN PIN,"Unfortunately you have to rate the items because this one doesn't deserve a half a star, much less one! I agree completely with ""Crespin Pin Pin"" (he he). Not really! He hit the nail exactly in the head! This item is a waste of money. If you see it at the store and you get tempted to buy if first plug it in an outlet before you have to have to make another trip to return it. By the way Crespin, I love your ID... he he he"
5,Powerful Fan,I purchased this fan for my desk at work. Where I sit there's no ventilation which makes it difficult to breath and it's hot. I wasn't sure if I should purchase it but I am glad I did. It is extremely powerful. There are three speeds but I use the lowest one. It keeps me cool and comfortable. It's a nice compact size and does not take up a lot of space on my small desk. It is loud but since I work in an open space my office is often noisey. Having this fan for white noise helps block out all the distracting office chatter.
1,"Poor quality, won't last",This fan is built really cheaply. It will last you 2 years at most. We have two of them. We use them at night for white noise. The fan motor fails in a short amount of time.The warranty is worthless because it is cheaper to buy another fan than it is to send it in for a warranty claim.The bottom line is you get what you pay for.
1,Loud and not long-lasting,"I purchased one of these fans over the summer. It's incredibly loud, but I could handle that. Unfortunately, it completely died after a little over a month of use - wouldn't even turn on. I'll definitely be looking for another brand next summer."
4,HT800 Super Turbo,"There mixed reviews but so far no problems. On high it really thinks it's a jet engine. I have never seen so much air moved by such a small fan. As to the noise level, my two are fairly quiet. I love it."
4,Sure is a $13 fan.,"I didn't expect much when I ordered this fan last month, but it's actually been pretty decent item. Yeah, it's a little plastic fan, so you can't use it to cool a whole room, but it works great as an ""it's so hot, I need a fan in my face all day"" solution. It definitely is loud, and I wouldn't recommend it as a fan primarily for nighttime, but it is very powerful over a small area and does what I need it to. I even accidentally sucked some plastic bits into the back of the fan and they wrapped around the motor, but the fan just automatically shut off and I was able to unwrap the plastic with no issues or damage to the fan. That impressed me quite a bit, as I thought that would be all for my cheap little fan.Overall, obviously on the cheap side, and definitely noisy, but not really flimsy and not easily destroyed. A good buy for the price."
5,Little fan that does a big job,"I have a home office that is a bit of a dead zone when it comes to air flow from the central air conditioner. I place the Honeywell fan on the floor to draw cool air into my office. It does a great job. It moves a lot of air and makes very little noise. Since getting it, I have noticed my wife ""borrowing"" it on multiple occasions for various jobs that require air flow. It's a winner."
3,smaller than the ones sold in the stores.,"I bought two of these thinking I was getting a steal... It is a smaller version of the one that I was thinking of.it serves its purpose, but is not what I really wanted or expected.I really purchased it for white noise... to fall asleep. I know it sounds weird but it helps me block out distractions while I sleep.Since it is so small the noise was minimal compared to the bigger size I am used to."
3,Nice Fan - but NOT Quiet,This is a great little lightweight fan and blows out a good stream of air. The only drawback is that it needs to be quieter. I should have looked a bit more for one that is not so noisy.
5,Powerful desk fan,"This is a great desk fan. I use it on my nightstand, and I'm very happy with it. One minor complaint. I wish it tilted forward. It tilts back, but my nightstand is slightly higher than the bed."
5,Love this fan!,"This is the second one (of this same fan) that we've bought. We love them! Great price, nice style, and powerful cooling. Reliable too - we've run one nightly for over a year and have had no problems at all. The only thing is - if you are looking for a very quiet fan, this might not be the one. Though in our case it is a plus; it functions as a white noise machine, and we actually sleep better with the sound than without it (muffles my husband's snoring)! I highly recommend it!"
1,Bah!,"Wow! This sure LOOKS like that other, excellent brand of fan that rhymes with ""Fornado"", but by comparison this fan is total garbage!! It moves a little bit of air at the cost of being able to hear anything else in the room, and the higher speeds don't really seem to increase the forward flow of air, although they do increase the noise even further.I made the huge mistake of buying a look-alike, and every time my room gets hot I regret my decision. Avoid the Honeywell. Yuck!!!"
4,great for a small fan!,just as small as the vornado fans but a lot less expensive. Makes more noise than vornado but just as effective! the noise from the fan actually helps me sleep as it's not an awful annoying sound - a fan and white noise machine all in one!! overall a great value for the price!
3,Moves Air But Too Loud,"For the price, I guess you can't beat the air this fan moves but if you plan on using it to get a cool, good night's sleep, you'd better have ear plugs. The fan does the job of moving air and it's pretty good at that. But the level of noise this fan produces is unacceptable to me. Mine is also not ""square"" meaning it doesn't sit firmly on its base and therefore vibrates which is very annoying. If noise is not a problem for you, then this is the fan to get."
3,"Good fan, but way too loud","This is a good fan, it circulates air well, is quite reasonably priced, and it can save energy by circulating ""conditioned"" air evenly throughout the room. My only problem with it, and this is a big problem, is that it is way too loud. Even on the lowest setting this fan is very loud. For some people this may not be a problem, but I could never imagine falling asleep with this beast turned on. I'm going to return the one I bought and try out other brands."
5,Whole lotta power!,This fan is small but it puts out alot of power. It is loud so if you were hoping for a quiet fan don't get this one because even on low it is loud. Makes a great fan for a garage or workout room.
3,works fine just a little big,delivery was above average. the fan was a too big for my desk but that was my own fault for not reading the measurements only going by picture. Anyway used fan once for poker night with my friends (plents of cigars) and it worked well for a small unit.
4,Loud but high quality,"I'm reading a few reviews about the noise level of this fan. Its not especially noisy -- rather its about what you would expect, especially for how strong it is. I have this fan set on low, sitting on my desk, and I have to move it all the way to the back of the desk so that I don't get *cold*. Its definitely a good value for the money. Its a very powerful and solidly built fan. Its not going to break from everyday usage. The frame allows you to tilt it up so you can use it to move air around the room, similar to how you would with an ""air circulator""-type fan. The fan does not oscillate."
4,"Good air movement, but not loud enough for me","I wanted this fan to drown out the night noises such as snoring, creaks, meowing cats etc. I thought this would do the trick, but it isn't quite loud enough. (I know most people want a quiter fan so this review may not be very helpful, so for you guys.... it is a great fan for the money and moves the air around quite nicely."
3,"Yeah, it's loud","This fan is blowing on my neck right now. My office is regularly 79 or 80 degrees in the summer so a fan is necessary. This fan is powerful but you should believe the loudness complaints in the other reviews. It's too loud, even on low. I'm putting a quieter fan on order right now."
5,SUPER FAN !!!!,"I have had this fan for 7 years, going on 8 ... This little fan has been going strong ever since with the exception of one summer two years back Oddly enough it went through a phase where I thought it was going to die and had to jump start it with a pencil... but this summer it has had no problems. OCCASIONALY there is a louder noise that would be what some of the other reviews are talking about, but it goes away.I have never had it tip from being top heavy and have propped it purposfully on uneven tables to drastically change the position with out a problem.The lowest setting is still very effective and I just can't stress enough how long this fan has lasted... it runs almost constantly and is still going strong... in fact it's cooling me off at the computer right now!"
4,great for white noise,"These fans are great! I use them to create 'white noise' in both of my daughters' rooms. we have a small house and it helps block out a lot of noise. My youngest daughter had colic and we went through tons of batteries in her 'white noise maker'; this fan is terrific in place of that.It does get rather dirty (I use it 24/7), but a 'swiffer' can get it mostly clean. But, I have replaced her first one after a year - just so it would be nice and clean. For $10 bucks, why not??But, I will tell you that each fan sounds different. some are quieter than others...but yes they are kind of loud."
2,Loud loud LOUD!,"I bought this fan for my dorm room before starting my first year of college, mainly because it was so cheap (a fifth of the price of a quality Vornado fan). However, this little fan made such noise (even on its lowest setting) that I regretted not spending more money for a better-made machine. I regularly had to sit down and attempt to clean out the layer of dust it accumulated on its blades - I've never seen dust like that on another fan.Bottom line, it's a cheap piece, don't bother unless you're already deaf."
3,Not as good as the older ones.,"I have 3 of these fans. They are used throughout the house to move air. I'm a bit disappointed in that the new fans are not as powerful or well built as the older ones of the same model. I've had 2 of these for about 5 years, one finally died last fall. I was very happy with the performance/size/value so I ordered 2 more. The new ones look exactly the same but they do not move as much air as the older one that is still running after 5 years. I'd say they push about 75% of what the older one does. Also, the plastic is softer, the old one is much more rigid. I doubt the newer ones will take the abuse that the older ones did. These are small fans, but not quiet on the high setting. Although they are quieter than most steel bladed fans. For the money, these are still nice little fans but I wish they had the performance and quality of the older ones."
4,Fan,Its a good fan - a little loud - but a good fan. It would have been a better deal if shipping expense didn't add additional 50% to the cost.
4,Moves a LOT of air!,"This fan has three power settings. I assumed they would be Low, Medium, and High. Really, they're High, Higher, and Hurricane.I will keep the fan and enjoy it, but for desk use, I wish I'd bought something with a slightly lower output. This is probably one of those cases where I should have gone to Walgreens and tested it out first!"
4,LIttle power Fan,"Great little fan.. Its a very powerful fan, dont be fooled by its size. Great for airing out rooms."
5,Little fan with a lot of power.,"This fan makes is a good energy alternative to keeping your air conditioner on at night. It's small enough to sit on a table or nightstand, quite enough (for a fan) to let you sleep, and it keeps you considerably cool during the night. Perfect for college students in apartments or dorms with no air-conditioning! Also good for summer camps."
1,Never going to buy Honeywell fans,"I've had this fan for 8 years. BUT I probably only turned it on for 30-60 minutes a day during the hottest weeks of the year.So worst case, we're talking 21 to 28 hours of use per year. Well recently the motor seized up and the fan doesn't turn anymore. Basically the bearings are shot.That means the fan only saw under 10 days of continuous use and it died. Or more accurately what probably happened is in 8 years, the lubricant they use is non-existent and gummed up. Either way, I doubt it uses quality bearings.On the other hand, my old-school 1960's window box fan handed down from my parents made by G.E. still works fine and was made here in the U.S.A. The Honeywell HT800 made in 2004 was manufactured in China.You can make your own conclusions."
5,great for white noise,I used this fan for white noise. After years of use it finally died on me. Disappointed that I can't buy another one just like it =( Great fan!
1,LOUDES FAN I'VE EVER HAD,I read a lot of reviews to get this. I can't believe it's so LOUD. It's impossible to use it at home. Maybe it works in the factories.
3,good,we purchased 2 of these they lasted for a while but if you're constantly running them the motors blow quickly.wouldn't suggest for use in hotter climates for continuous use.
2,"Inexpensive, lasted a year","I bought this fan at CVS for around $20. It worked fairly well for about a year and then it began to sputter and finally quit. This fan is very difficult to clean. I tried opening the front by taking out the screws in the back but they stripped quite easily which made it impossible to take off. The only way to clean the dust off the blades was to run it under water in the sink. Also, somehow it lost tension on the sides so it would cease to stay where you positioned it. I actually had to wrap the cord over the top and underneath the base to keep it in the lowest position. You are probably better off investing more money in a more reliable fan."
3,Honeywell Turbo Fan,Good and powerful fan we use them a lot. You can buy these many places. This one shipped with missing rubber feet and moves around and rattles without the feet. Had to set on a washcloth to solve problem. May look locally next time for easier return if no rubber feet installed on fan base.
4,"Pushes lots of air, makes lots of noise","Rather than spell out pros and cons, I'll just call them all ""observations,"" since one person's noisy fan is another person's white noise heaven. Anyway, here are my observations after having owned one of these fans for over a year:1) It moves a lot of air for its size;2) It has three speeds, the slowest being quite breezy and the fastest being only marginally faster than the slowest (in my opinion, Honeywell could've done without the middle setting altogether, or slowed down the slowest setting more);3) This fan puts out a lot of white noise, even on its slowest setting -- I would compare its slowest setting to the white noise of a box fan on medium;4) I used this fan unsuccessfully in an office environment (too noisy because I couldn't put the fan more than five feet away from my desk) but successfully in a home environment (white noise puts my wife to sleep while still moving quite a bit of air from 10 feet away from our bed)"
3,Works Good,"It fit where I wanted it to fit, but was a little bit noisy. Works great though for the money."
4,Whirrrrrrrrrrrr.,"Does its job, but is rather loud in doing it. The noise settles into a background hum, but if you're looking for a silent fan look elsewhere."
2,Very loud fan,"If you want to use this fan on a hot summer night to cool you off as you fall asleep, you won't be able to, this fan is far too loud. Its as loud as a large window fan. That being said, its the most powerful small fan that I have ever seen. Personally, I would rather have a quiet fan."
2,Lowsy performance,This fan takes at least a minute to get up to speed...very dissapointed in the performance
5,This fan BLOWS (in a good way...get it?),"Powerful, quiet, durable, what more do you need. I now own three of these and would never buy another kind of fan. Plus you can tilt the head straight up which is great for circulating air or drying a recently painted ceiling."
5,Great airflow. Noisy.,"#1, it works. This fan moves a lot of air. I have no idea how many CFM. I couldn't find the info online either.#2, It's loud. On setting 1, it's audible. On setting 3, at 4 feet, you'll be speaking over it's noise.#3, It lasts a long time. The motor is heavy duty. I've had my fan for 9 years and keep it as a shop fan.The best uses for this are for clearing out air (eg, exhaust fan), forced air movement (blowing down a hall, or moving floor air to the ceiling), or for drying things (drywall, though paint might pick up dust with direct blow).I've even used this to blow over an electric stove to heat a giant room for a day before gas service was turned on. We evaporated 8 ounces per hour out of a 250sqft of wall texture this way."
1,Low Quality fan,"I bought 5 of these fans because of the reviews I have read here. Of the 5 only one still works. They only lasted a year. They are cheap, but you get what you pay for. They are disposable. Expect to buy a new one every year."
4,Turbo,Update: I went shopping for a new fan and is not buy this one. I decided it was too loud and went with one quieter & more expensive hoping it will last longer. (So I guess I'm not 4 stars happy with this.)This fan is VERY loud. I'm sure the word turbo was carefully chosen. A fan this small has to be noisy to move so much air. We have gone through at least 3 over the past 4 years. We run ours constantly during the summer to get the AC where it needs to be in our old house. I will be buying a replacement for the one that died last year.
2,Powerful but Noisy,"These are nice small powerful fans. They pack a punch for their size. However, they are also quite noisy (even on ""low""). My ceiling fan is quieter then this thing."
4,"Powerful. Basically too powerful. Exchange the 2 highest speeds, with two lower speeds.","Powerful. Basically too powerful. Exchange the 2 highest speeds, with two lower speeds. We only use the lowest speed which is still pretty high. It's a good fan. Loud enough to serve as a white noise maker as well."
2,Lasted 5 months,We've purchased these fans for years and have always been happy with them until now. We purchased 2 of them in February and 1 has already died and the other is starting to make noises telling me it's next. Amazon has properly stopped selling them until Honeywell gets it's act together.
2,"Powerful, noisy, short life","I bought this fan for use at night while I was sleeping. It worked great for awhile, and the loud noise drown out the birds that liked to wake up and play at 4:30 in the morning right outside my window.About nine months later, though, it's on its last leg. For 15-20 mintues after I first turn it on, the blades rotate very slowly. With patience it will get up to about half of the speed it had when brand new, which is still tolerable. It requires the highest setting to actually move any air, though.So it works great for a year or so if you're lucky. If that's worth $10-15 and you don't mind the sound, this is the fan for you. If you expect more than a few months out of a product, look for better quality."
4,"For the money, a good little fan","You can't beat it for the price. It is a little loud as previously reported, but overall a good buy when the price is considered."
3,"Big wind, big sound.","This fan is ok if all you want a narrow stream of directed air, but be aware that it's very loud."
5,Ark - Burn the Sun,"This CD is nothing short of awesome! This band is talented and very refinded as far technique goes. They could have been one of those bands that is so good that they border on mediocrety; but they have achieved greatness and technique simultaneously.The production is super tight, and the album is so well done that I have listened to it at least 6 times and I'm still excited every time I here it.If your looking for a metal album, the first track is about all your going to get. What you get instead is awesome songwriting and arranging with heavy metal influences. The metal is there, it's just not center stage all the time.This album has made it in my top 10 list...and that's pretty difficult to do.The first time I heard of this band was on my favorite Internet radio station, www.Reignradio.com. This is the most super awesome thing to happen to the internet in at least a year! Check it out sometime."
3,Nice. But not what I'd hoped for,"Be careful and read the dimentions of the item, the picture will not give you a good idea of its actual size, depending on your resolution. It is nice, the stone is large. But this piece does not give an overall impression of quality. Considering the price of silver, and the quality of the item, I have a vague feeling of being ripped off... not enough to return it, but enough to just be slightly annoyed."
4,Works as expected,Works as expected. I would give it 5 stars but its a bit slippery on the bottom and has a tendency to slide all over the place.
4,"So far, so good",Just received the changing pad and it came exactly as described. Fit our changing table perfectly. We like the thickness of the pad and the contour. It appears to be very good quailty for the price!
4,Changing Pad,I received the changing pad in mail yesterday. I bought it based on the positive reviews. I only give it a 4 out of 5 b/c I have not used the pad yet. It looks like it will be a good changing pad but I will just have to wait and see.
3,Bought for a friend,"Although I did not use the item, it arrived in just a plastic wrap, which was partially torn and the pad at that place was dirty."
2,Louis is great as usual; the reissue isn't,"This is a ragtag collection of sides taken from source material of varying quality: some metal parts, some 'early tape transfers' and even one snagged from an LP reissue. The sound quality is pretty good, though a lot of the songs 'blast' more than they ought to. That's all possible to deal with. The part that can't be forgiven is the fact that nearly every one of these records is off center, and the pitch wobbles throughout the entire CD. That is very easily corrected, and should have been the first thing these engineers fixed. But they didn't, and Louis sounds out of tune."
2,Wire was tangled from the start,"When I opened the box and tried to pull the cable, it tangled right away. I tried to fix it, but to no avail."
3,Must be read with the other 2 parts of the Trilogy,"Wonderful prose, beautifully observed character study, as WG slips into the skin of an extremely priggish and snobbish early twenties aristocrat as he comes of age and begins to understand a little more of the virtues of the ordinary people around him. Sea journeys of that era were long, tedious, largely uneventful and extremely uncomfortable. All 3 books in the trilogy carry this perfectly: the maritime atmosphere is conveyed as perfectly as the arrogant character of the narrator. However, the tedium of the journey also comes across in the virtually non-existent plot which makes the books drag on somewhat. It is probably, though, as brilliant description of the English class system at the start of the 19th century as you will read. I believe that the books in Trilogies should be able to stand alone, if they are to be sold separately, & on that basis, this trilogy definitely fails. I'm glad I read it as a single 750 page tome."
2,"Great book, bizarre edition","I am referring to the Thaisunset edition in this review (black cover with slightly incongruous topless native woman illustration). The content of Freud's book is still interesting today, of course. The Brill translation is stiff and somewhat old-fashioned but certainly enjoyable.This edition has problems. Though attractively produced and clearly typeset it contains many typographical errors. It also makes the bizarre decision to place the footnotes in the text, indented, proceded with both a number and a little bracketed notification that the footnote is about to begin, and then followed by a similar notification that the footnote is over and we can all relax now. I gather that the text is in the public domain and the publisher has released it with minimal formatting. Very disappointing. It is still readable, but is certainly not what I expected."
4,A perfect exemplar of Freud's central arguments,"Totem and Taboo, along with _The Future of an Illusion_, should be necessary reading for any serious student of social science. Of course, there are massive holes in Freud's arguments (such as his tendancy to make sweeping generalizations about other cultures from his armchair in Europe), but people who disagree with him for moral and ethical reasons tend to amplify those holes and simply ridicule Freud the man instead of intelligently approaching his arguments.The fact is, his suppositions about parental relations (as they relate to ""totem"" cultures), about religion, and about sexuality are extremely relevant and have proven, over the years, to possess an extraordinary predictive power. Even if one disagrees with this literature, one should read it and know exactly what they disagree with."
2,"TWO ""WRONGS"" DON'T MAKE A ""RIGHT""","Although it has some excellent moments, ""Missing Piece"" marked the beginning of Gentle Giant's decline as they headed in a ""pop"" direction: 3 stars. ""Giant for a Day"" is almost unlistenable, as far as I'm concerned, considering what these incredible musician/composers were capable of: 1 star. Putting two of the band's weakest recordings together on one CD makes it easier to avoid both? Brilliant!"
3,"if i gave this five, the power and the glory would need ten","as always with giant, some excellent tracks (esp. mountain time). but what are we to make of, for example, ""friends""? it was this track that made me not bother to listen to ""civilian"" until last year. (i was pleasantly surprised - giant had finally made a good mainstream album)."
2,It's a real disappointment.,"Missing PieceIt's a real disappointment. To me GG influenced by New Waive and Punk sounds the same as Bach influenced by Irving Berlin. On top of that, I've always thought that to be a successful NW group one would need one string, a huge drum and a van big enough to fit it. So it's not New Wave, it's a fake, too good a performance. But not all is lost here. As Old As You're Young is a real GG thing, this one alone is worth buying the record for and if it was the only track on the album I would have given it 5 stars."
3,Buy the season 1 box set,"cute short movie but if you want these episodes and more just buy the My little pony season 1 box set. I am just keeping my fingers crossed for a season 2 release, or a my little pony tales relase."
3,Ray Bradbury Collector's Set (16 Episodes),"This was a gift for my daughter. Her rating was as follows: The episodes were only OK, however nothing to rave about. They were not very exciting and seemed to drag on, at times they were boring."
1,mop,"I have a cedar mop for over 2 years. And bought the refill from Dept, Store, last us 2-3 years but just was too dirty.This refill we received was immediately unraveling at the seam of the garter after ONE use. I expected that this productwas going to be the same as my old one because it is made by CEDAR too.I have to use my old one and just maybe look around at dept store.again.The product has a very poor quality and workmanship."
5,GREAT,Bought this as a replacement to a CD that was lost or stolen some time ago. Great music and a wonderful compilation.
4,Be Careful What Ella Fitzgerald You Order,"Be careful that you are ordering the right Ella Fitzgeral CD. There is another outstanding Ella Fitzgerald CD by almost the same name that is very different. It is called ""Pure Ella: The Very Best of Ella Fitzgerald,"" and it is the best Elle Fitzgerald ever made.So don't accidentally order this CD thinking you are getting the other one.This very enjoyable CD shows a nice side of Ella with the Piano and Gershwin songs, and would make a nice addition to your collection. But it would not be one of my first three choices by Ella Fitzgerald. My first choice would be the other one: ""Pure Ella: The Very Best of Ella Fitzgerald,"" released in 1998."
1,Possibly the worst movie in history,"I honestly am of the opinion that this is one of, if not /the worst/ movie in history, and I love it for that. This movie is literally so awful that the only thing you can possibly do with it is... hype the movie up and invite your friends over for a bit of audio-visual torture."
2,Star Knight Star Bright,"A nifty little movie with a flying saucer visiting the world of knights & wizards in old Europe. Good actors, Okay movie. Unfortunately there is a flaw, and it is a huge one. The producer's of this DVD should have spent a little more time on it. The audio and video don't track together, with the audio being about one second ahead of the visual. This renders the entire movie into bad comedic farce. Unfortunately the effect is not entertaining, but rather is a headache. I would have to recomend that you avoid this film, at least until some other company creates a viewable version."
4,great cd,ya know what other people might think as superchunk getting borin but they are still rocking out in songs like art glass
2,I do not look forward to this album,"I don't know why Superchunk has decided that its songs need to be slathered with keyboards. And Mac has decided that he likes crooning when his excited yelp is a whole lot more fun. This album just doesn't have a lot of energy, and that's something Superchunk used to have in spades.""Rainy Streets"" and ""Out On The Wing"" rock out nicely. And ""Late-Century Dream"" is an interestingly low-key experiment that actually works. The pedal steel on ""Phone Sex"" is a nifty touch, but the song winds up being a near-miss."
2,a long way to fall,"I loved Superchunk back in the day. Saw them live in the mid-90s and they were amazing. But after ""Foolish"" the energy just seemed to leak out of them until they've come to this. Alt, indie, rawken role--whatever its alias--should never have strings. Period. ""Maturity"" is no excuse for a viola or a cello. If you've really found maturity, write better lyrics. This is elevator music for indie punkers starting to gray around the temples. Sadly, the ""chunk"" could learn a little something from old punkers like Dead Moon about how getting long in the tooth doesn't mean you can't still tear it up. For those new to Superchunk, go back and listen to everything from ""No Pocky For Kitty"" to ""Foolish"". Those were great recordings and they had a good run. Too bad they outran their own legend."
2,Here's to old age,"It's not that this is a terrible album in concept (or in title, Here's to Shutting Up is definitely a favorite for me, if only Fred Durst would make an album like that) but the album lacks any of the elements that Superchunk is known. This is not to say that they shouldn't explore new avenues, but this album demonstrates more of a lack of enthusiasm than a need for growth. It starts out ok and credit should be given that the opening track states the new mission state ment with folkier guitars and poppy back ground vocals, but the back is missing something. Even when they return to puchy guitar style of old they lack something vital. I suppose that if I can't put my finger on exactly what's missing, than it would be unfair for me to expect Superchunk to, but I still found myself growing increasingly bored as the album played itself out."
4,"The ""Voice"" Returns...","Superchunk, the catchy quartet from N.C, have returned with a pretty good cd. It is clear Mac is still a talented songwriter. It's impossible to compare this album to their older ones. It is obviously not as good as ""on the mouth"" or ""no pocky for kitty"". I do not have many gripes with this album, but his lyrics are not his best. Also, I don't know why he is still using the falsetto, even though i must admit he's gotten way better at it. Anyway, I've written more than i should have. Buy this CD, its good stuff."
4,Insanity is Insane,This program is insane!! I love it. Its such high intervals that mynheartrate jumps through the roof. I have lost over 17 lbs so far in 2 weeks. It has changed my life.
3,insanity is insanity,"this is not a beginner program. if you're looking to start easy and work up to your max, i would probably start with something else then move to this program."
5,best workout ever!,If you need to drop weight and think you can handle fast paced workouts then this is for you! shaun t is great for motivating you to go faster and to not quit. you can do it
4,INSANITY DELUXE,I PURCHASED THIS WORKOUT PROGRAM FOR MY FIANCE'. SHE LOVES IT. SHE CONTINUOUSLY DESCRIBED THE CARDIO ASPECT OF THE WORKOUT PROGRAM IS GREAT. SHE IS A VERY ENTHUSIASTIC TRAINER AND HAS MANY POSITIVE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE PROGRAM COMPARED TO PERSONAL TRAINERS AND OTHER WORKOUT PROGRAMS.
5,Not Rocket Science! You will sweat!,"I loved this training. Completely different to the sprinkle your donuts and love weight mentality. Completely opposite indeed, you will earn your body and you will become healthy.The program is completely worthy. I lost 30 pounds 2 sizes jeans and I feel so healthy I can't explain the difference. Do this or any similar program. Get in better shape, control your body and your instincts and beautiful thing will come your way for enjoyment.That being said, I doubt that anyone would ever need the deluxe program. If I get to do this purchase again, I get the other ""vanilla"" package. And possibly a fat caliper. But the jump mat it is only used on few session and just for a little bit. It is priced ~$80 separately, completely waste of money. Fat caliper.... Cheap and ugly.That being said, the program is incredible and well the price and 5 stars for sure."
4,Outsourced,"Having lived in India for several years, this was a fun story but our DVD had several glitches in it which made it harder to watch. The film was well made but the CD was of poor quality and froze up several times during the viewing."
1,Outsourced,Had the possibility of a great movie - sorry the story contained too much unfaithfulness - would not watch it again
2,Struggles to reach average,"5 Stars? Really? So this is up there with 'The Godfather' and 'Citizen Kane'? Look, I get that this is supposed to be a lighthearted romantic comedy but it was utterly predictable and dull, with a cliched ""fish out of water"" plot right out of Scriptwriting 101. Sample scene: man tells his boss there is no way he is traveling to India. Want to guess what the next scene will be? The whole film is like this, moving from one predictable plot point to another with obvious jokes so blunt that they could be punctuated with a rimshot on the soundtrack. Josh Hamilton in the lead role doesn't help much as he is too bland to conjure any believable chemistry with Asif Basra.Yes, a lot of the events in the film are the types of things an expat would experience traveling and working in India. But a film needs more than veracity to achieve greatness -- and this film is not great - or even good."
4,Always watch a movie like this before you travel overseas.,"Great movie. It was predictable, but still very well done. If you liked this movie, watch Mr. Baseball with Tom Selleck. Same basic story, just takes place in Japan.As an American living overseas I really appreciate the ""fish out of water story."" Every American should watch a movie like this before they travel to another country. Respect that country and embrace the different customs and you can only grow from the experience."
3,Enjoyable enough but talk about missed opportunities!,"This a cute movie that could have gone many ways. It could have been hilarious, with the staff of the Indian call center trying to figure out why anybody would buy the stuff they were selling. Or, it could have been a great romance, instead of something you know is coming but is just a blip near the end. Or, it could have been a thought-provoking story about how a job that's lost in the US provides a chance in life for someone in another country. But it wasn't any of those things and so predictable I felt like I was directing it. Worth a look but this is that rare case where the idea is great but a remake would probably be better."
4,A holiday in Goa with Ayesha Dharker?,"Could an American guy be so lucky?I love these west meets east styled innocent romance films. When an American guy meets a falls in love with a beautiful Indian girl, I couldn't imagine a more beautiful fantasy. If you liked this film, check out Americanizing Shelley, The Other End of the Line, Mississippi Masala, Mistress of Spices, Bend it Like Beckham, Kama Sutra: A Tale of Love, Tales of the Kama Sutra, and maybe Bride and Prejudice (with the insatiably beautiful Aishwarya Rai).And if you're really brave and hungry for some real India (Bollywood) films, ask me about some good films that show many of India's most beautiful actresses. I could turn you on to so many hot Indian films; you may never care about the typical aging American actress ever again. Trust me!"
4,Fun movie especially if you like India!,I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. Quite a bit of what the movie shows on India is spot on and very funny (no disrespect intended). Fun movie to watch on a Friday night.
4,Interesting and humorous,This was an interesting film and taught me a lot about the Indian people and their culture and had wonderful humour as well.
4,A Delightful Comedy,"If you like light-hearted romantic comedies, this is one to see. The cross-cultural differences in business, family, social, and romantic relationships provide a number of funny moments and an enjoyable story.Josh Hamilton and Ayesha Dharker find that working together in India to improve productivity in a mediocre call center not only stirs the passions of these 2 stellar producers but also gets the attention of the corporate execs back in the States.4+ stars."
3,A surprisingly entertaining film,I really enjoyed the movie. I thought it was a great mix of cultural and current business situations. It was also thought the romantic side story was very cute.
3,unsure about legitimacy,"I suspect that the dvd I received might be a high quality copy. The discs are purple, the labels look like stickers, and the video quality doesn't look quite right."
3,Alright,"I was required to watch by an anthropology teacher. It was ok, but not something I would normally want to watch."
4,this is an absolutely great movie,"this is a great comedy. I'm not going to tell you more, or I would be a spoiler."
3,An entertaining depiction of cultural gaps,"Outsourced is an intelligent subject to depict how the American culture is seen abroad. Contemporary and poetic, great shots and colors, the movie offers a nice way to learn further how cultural intelligence goes a long way when management as we know it does not."
1,Unreadable and total crap,"I've read a lot of books, and I think I have high level of tolerance for even a piece of rubbish.However, this novel is written very very badly. Sentences are extremely convoluted. The sentences of Lord of the Rings are complex, but they are with a lot of grace and enjoyable to read. For this novel, however, the sentences are convoluted without any aim other than merely trying to postpone the placing of the period. I read 5 pages and I gave up.Try it if you want to test your tolerance."
1,WTF! This guy is a cheater,"This thing, is now regular gundam model kit that you do it yourselfIt sells only 15 dollars in Japan, why you sell it for more than 30 dollars?!"
4,DISNEY'S MY VERY FIRST DICTIONARY,"I LIKE THIS DICTIONARY. FIRST, BECAUSE IT REALLY DOESN'T GO INTO TOO MUCH ANALYSIS OF THE WORDS. IT JUST GIVES YOU A FAMILIAR REMINDER OF WHAT EACH WORD MEANS. THE RHYMING IS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR LITTLE ONES TO GET A BASIS FOR WORDS THAT ARE SIMILAR IN SOUND.KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS ONLY A BEGINNING STEP TOWARD WORD MEANINGS. MY GRANDCHILDREN LIKED IT. THEY FELL LIKE THEY ARE READING A STORY INSTEAD OF A DICTIONARY, ONLY THIS STORY HAS ALL THE WORDS IN ALPHABETIC ORDER. I NOTICED THAT IT ALSO GIVES THEM A MEANS OF UTILIZING THIS DICTIONARY TO PICK OUT WORDS AND PICTURES TO MAKE THEIR OWN STORIES."
1,Review of A Fall in Denver - An Em Hansen Mystery,"I ordered this book because someone told me the first line, which was something like this: If I had seen the body falling past the window, I would not have accepted the job. It is the only good line in the book. The author's style is unpolished. One annoying thing which comes to mind is her character from a southern state. There are repeated grammatical errors put in that character's mouth. I read maybe a fourth of the book before I decided I could not endure reading further. The one thing I am glad about is that I bought a second hand copy."
4,The Arrival,"""The Arrival"" (1991) is about a missing meteor that no one ever really looks for. Instead, they spend their time searching for an entity inside one of the myriad guts of the elderly Max, who is depopulating and killing female nurses as the need arises and drinking the blood of the victims in this cinematic, yet interesting, mess. This was fascinating Horror Sci-Fi that had farfetched plotlines.With melodramatic dialogue, delivered for the most part by wooden, heavily solid B-movie performers, ""The Arrival"" is pure implausibility-- a jumble of a Sci-Fi movie that promises intrigue and aliens but in the end delivers neither.The Arrival is a slightly decent Sci-Fi Horror movie. Nothing spectacular, but enough to capture your interest to watch it all the way through. Typical alien life form Sci-Fi fare."
2,Umm No!,"I like Mandy Moore. ""I Wanna Be With You"" (IMO) is one of the best teen-pop ballads rivaling Christina's ""Beautiful"". Her self-titled album ""Mandy Moore"" was fun Pop-music with real creativity. And ""Coverage"" was really an album showing a more mature direction that Mandy decided to take. But this collection of songs was a last attempt for this music label to make money before she moves to another label. She didn't want to release this; but what can you do? Well don't support this obvious cash-in. Other than her self-titled album and ""Coverage it's also worth checking into ""A Walk to Remember"" soundtrack. I can't wait to see what Mandy does next."
1,Sony just trying to cash in.,"I would buy this album if it was under WB/Sire. This is just a good example on how record companies cash in on an artist that has left their label. Mandy is no longer with Sony, so I don't think I'll be buying this album. It's just a good example of them trying to cash in on her success. I rate it 1 star because of the record company releasing it, not because of Mandy. She has a wonderful voice and amazing talent, but she's not promoting this album, and neither will I buy it if it's not being backed by her."
5,Five Stars!,"I like Mandy Moore. If I was in high school with her, I'd ask her to prom. She would have probably said no to me, I bet. But she just seems so nice she would have probably said it in a really nice way, like ""Oh, that's so sweet, but I'm going solo this year!"" And even though she shot me down, I'd love her even more afterwards! Isn't life crazy?"
3,Good...but it's just a Sony cash-in,"The woman herself didn't want a Greatest Hits released..And I can agree with that. Although she's had a number of hits (""Candy"" being her biggest one), a lot of her songs were just minor hits and she's only had really ... I guess 4 albums released (I included ""I Wanna Be With You"", even though 1/2 of it is ""So Real"" [her first album])...The videos and the [soundtrack] songs are what's really worth investing into. Other than that, there's nothing all that much to rave about..Bring on the next album, Mandy!"
4,a very different pop collection,"While some people will hear this young lady They absolutely think ""OH Another Britney or Christina"" I am sorry to say but in no way she deserves to be compared with those hacks. Mandy Moore brings something unique which is real songs like ""I wanna be with you"", ""In my pocket"" and the tribute to Doris Day ""Secret love""So Fans rejoice and enjoy the best of Mandy Moore."
5,Great Mandy Set,"This is a great collection of Mandy Moore songs. Though her latest album had a folksy style, the songs on this cd are still good. The video collection also includes live songs she did for AOL sessions."
4,It had to be done...,"I know many think that the creation of a greatest hits album was a little early, but Sony did it as a final attempt to make money on Mandy since she was leaving Sony records to join Sire Records."
4,"Could not put down,Very informative and opinionated",I just have to say wow. Makes your head spin. But thats a good thing. Must at least take a look at to form your own opinion.
3,To Expensive On this Website,"This product came recommended to me by a homeschooler of a 3 year old boy, so I bought it for $31.99 with free shipping from Buy.com. Thus, I would not recommend overpaying for the item on this website at $53.99. Shop around."
2,good product,"good product but no is what i expected, was my fault i need a case for xda ii and this product is for xda ii mini"
4,Wide-ranging,"This work contains discussions with 32 different historians, covering all the period from prehistory to ""Contemporary World History"". The book could have been much better if it included a bibliography and a list of works by the various historians with whom the discussions were had. When I finished the book, because it covered so much time, the early part of the book seemed long ago already!"
3,Sci Fi? Sci Hy(steria)!,"One for the Social Historians to pore over: otherwise, a rollicking yarn, and a worthy addition to reading material for acolytes of the National Rifle Association."
5,This book changed my life!!!,"All single women who hope to someday enter into that blessed state of holy matrimony should prepare now by reading this book. After reading this book, I was moved to action, and I have not stopped moving since. P.B. Wilson is anointed to speak truth in areas that we often fail to consider from day to day. I was sincerely blessed by this book and trust that many other readers will be too!!! Thanks P.B.!!!"
2,Just wasn't right for me,"Honestly, I really didn't like this book very much. Maybe it was just me, but I feel like I've read a lot of Christian singles books that have been better. I think a lot of my problem was that I didn't relate to the author at all. It seemed like she continued on and on about her husband and children and obviously as a single person that's doesn't connect with me. There were some very good parts of the book where I connected with what she was saying and very deeply with God, but I felt those moments were rare and buried amongst a lot of mundane things. If you haven't read it yet, you might like it, but I would recommend borrowing it from a friend rather than buying it."
3,Good Message but Quite Restricting Lifestyle,"Book has a good message, but will be extremely confinding for some. I recommend each reader to just take out of it, what may apply to you and your lifestyle. Even if you're a devoted Christian, the fact remains that wheather we like it or not, we are living as humans in the world. And so few of us could live as the book suggests we live. So are we doomed? Will God not forgive us? I don't think so! But I will say it requires a great deal of discpline and strength to be a full Christian. And if so, this book is for you."
4,Life's Lesson's in a card game,"The Great Dalmuti, a long-time favorite card and role playing game of middle schoolers, and one we've played for years in our house, continues to delight us. After being out-of-print for some time when only German versions were available, it's back. It's a different type of game with a different deck of cards, easily understood, but full of strategy. The winner carries an advantage into the next hand- and plays the role. But danger lurks in the cards for the Great Dalmuti... A real find- recommended."
2,The brush doesn't give me any more fullness that the one I have...Would not recommend this product.,This brush didn't give me anymore fullness than the brush I already had . I would not recommend this product to anyone for fullness..
4,Great Voice Suspect Material at times,"Billie Holiday never lost anything Vocally on this Box Set or any other time period.but at more times than not the music wasn't always up too Her Talent.Too Really Appreciate Her Genius Listen too Her Raw without all the Over the Top Arrangements.There's nothing like Her Voice it's a Diamond onto itself.their's Good Solid Material here.Ain't Nobody's Business,No Good Man are just some of the cuts that make this worthy of Listening.Lady Day was one of a kind."
4,PA mountain stories,Good book for the outdoors type person. My husband enjoyed many of the stories in this book.
4,A good supplementary text to Enlightenment studies,I took a college course on the Enlightenment. The Outram book gave a slightly different perspective from the course texts. It was worth it.
1,Dire Performance,"A typical example of Modern Academic Style -- impotent, equivocal, non-committal; everything is ""problematic."" It has some potential although unpleasurable use as an indication of the current state of academic debates concerning the Enlightenment (although on that score, it will go out of date fast), and it can point one in the direction of some better books, such as Albion W. Small's ""The Cameralists,"" an interesting, confident 1909 study that can still be read with pleasure and profit one hundred years after publication -- because of that very confidence (as well as the depth of Small's research). The mousiness of Outram's text is, by contrast, extremely unattractive."
1,dissapointing,"my brother bought this game, and i had nothing to do with it. i thought it would be like tony hawk's underground 2 which i own and love. But i came to find out its nothin like it! tony hawk's american wasteland is the worst game i've ever seen. the graphics are pathetic, and the game even messed up. we couldnt get past this one challenge. it made no sense. so we stopped playing it after a day! just horrible. i guess different companies made tony hawk's underground 2 and tony hawk's american wasteland."
3,One of the better skating games,American Wasteland is alright not all that fun but not so bad that no one would buy it. Once you get in to it it's not that bad but it doesn't take very long to beat I beat it in one day.
5,Exhaust tip,Not only functional but the burb looks real sharp now! You have to watch not to try and install it too close to the bend in the pipe because it won't fit. the pipe narrows at the bend and you will not able to tighten the bolt.
2,Too small,I am disappointed in these blocks. They are much smaller than I had anticipated... definitely a choking hazard for smaller children in the house.
2,Lots of Little Pieces,"The blocks were a lot smaller than I was expecting. Some could easily fit in a little ones mouth. I do not let my youngest play with the blocks without adult supervision, for fear of a choking hazard."
2,Poor effort,"I am a fan, but this is not Mullen's best work. She is trying to be too different on this one, when a good Christmas CD simply relies on the tried and true classics."
5,An Album For Life Not Just For Christmas,"""I wish Christmas could last 365 days a year"" sings Nicole..which may be why she's come up with a CD you'll want to listen to any time of the year.Not your usual cheesy cash in album by any means...Nicole only ever disppoints if you expect her to be predictable.If you loved her first two albums you'll love this one...even if you're reading this review in july!"
4,Soulful Christmas Album,"Nicole C. Mullen is one of my favorite female vocalists. Allow me, then, to state this is neither my favorite Mullen album nor my favorite Christmas album. That being said, this is still a good album and one I would recommend.For me, the high point would be a pop/R&B; Christmas album, and this is very good in that area. The low point is that it contains a lot of songs I'm not as familiar with.There are some wonderful secular holiday songs, such as ""The Christmas Song"" (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire). For me, though, I am a Christian seeking a Christmas item from a Christian artist, and I personally would have preferred an exclusively Christian collection. This is nit-picking, and just my opinion.If you are looking for a Christmas album for a gift, and that person is into R&B;, I believe they would really enjoy the album, maybe more than I do. Forgive me if this review sounds negative: Nicole Mullen had set a high bar, and failed to meet that bar on this project."
5,NICE LATE FORTIES LITTLE JAZZ,"I admit that I like almost any recording by Roy Eldridge, but I like the period after the war, but before the fifties. You get the wild exhibitions, the low moaning sounds; in short you get almost all his styles with this recording. My personal favorites are ""jump through the window"", and the demo for a new record (that was not picked up) ""Christopher Columbus"". Music missing from this disc can be found on Chronological Classics 1945-1947"". But I bought, because it has a lot music in the same place."
4,Different.,"This is a lovely, moving CD, but different than what I'd expected, based on her other CD's. This one has much more Native American influence and fewer songs one could teach to others (which was what I was looking for). So it was disappointing to me personally, but I still recognize that this is fine music."
1,OVERPRICED!!!!,"I am an educator and am highly insulted that someone out there is pricing a thirty minute ""educational video"" at such an absurd price! I would have been interested in having this video to help my students learn about perspective drawing, but I guess my students will just have to miss out on watching this video due to money hungry sellers on Amazon."
3,Prelude,Nothing special - needed it for class.Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
2,self obsessed and dull,"I used to like the Romantics - but this revealed to me the extent to which they were all immersed in their own selves so much they couldn't see beyond the individual. Wordsworth is long-winded and dull in linguistic terms, but admittedly some of the imagery (boat-stealing episode) is inspired. It is, fundamentally, all about himself though, and traces his own poetic growth which is interesting as a topic, but not the way Wordsworth does it. He throws in a few token pictures of the poor, who he was so concerned about, but these tend to be superficial compared to his own self. Dull, dull, dull, a complete waste of time. If you have to read it for a course, get the york notes or only read the 1799 version"
5,"A ""Must Have"" For That Well-Rounded Jazz Collection","Coleman Hawkins In The 50's -- Body And Soul Revisited delivers an exciting sampling of the Hawk's wonders. These beautifully remastered recordings from his Decca years showcase his mastery of the tenor sax and genious with improvisation and phrasing -- and makes it sound effortless. This has also become a favorite of my teenage daughter, who readily recognizes the influence of Coleman Hawkins on today's Jazz scene."
2,It's OK,I have read better books but his book is ok for a lazy summer read. I found it difficult to finish because the plot dragged at times. I wouldn't read any of her other books.
3,Good First Novel,This was a very exciting but somewhat long book. Characters were well developed and this was a good first novel. I'm looking forward to the next novel.
5,Chocolate Star,Read this book from San Jose Ca. to Spokane Washington and loved every 21 hours of it.
3,Sheila Copeland is an exceptional writer!,"I have read and reread this book many times. I feel that Sheila Copeland has captured the thoughts and fears, as well as goals of many young African- Americans. I feel that this story of three different Blacks and their rise to fame can be a lesson to many, if not all, African- Americans, as well as other nationalities."
3,"okay now, okay now",This was one of the first books that I read when I first got into reading last year. I read like 3-4 books a month. This book opened me up to black fiction books. This book was tight for real. I would recommend it to everyone.
3,Good but not Great,"The book was fun and not boring. I enjoyed the colorful, and I use that term loosely, characters. It was a bit pretentious at times which took a lot away from it. Sean's character is to be admired, but his referring to his mother and father as ""Mommy"" and ""Daddy"" was a bit out there. I do not need to know every single piece of food on each plate each time. I do not need to learn a person's complexion before I learn anything about that person. Brand names mentioned repetetively do not hold my attention. Louis Vuitton and Chanel were thrown around far more times than I wish to count. Although all these played a major factor in my rating of this book, I did enjoy it. Overall, Chocolate Star was a good read. Only the author's writing technique left a lot to be desired."
2,This one is just not for Me,"This was a book that was just not writen for me. I did not care for the casual drug usage.Why did Topaz have to throw the phone everytime she hangs up.Anyway this is a book that took me back, her mentioning Arsenio Hall show (HA HA) made me feel old.It just is not a story for the New Millennium.I'm going to give A Chocolate Affair a try."
4,"The Bold and the Beautiful, Afro American style","This story was a pretty good read if you like the glitz-glamour scene of the young elite; however, it was a bit long. I thought Copeland did pretty well with creating this story without harsh profanity, but a little cussing would've given the drama a bit more punch!"
3,Pretty intersting despite its faults,"Chocolate Star was a good book overall. I liked how each chapter focused on one of the three main characters. I really liked Sylk Ross, but I hated how he referred to his parents. I mean come on, how many grown men call their parents ""Mommy and Daddy"". And I got so tired of Gunther and his use of ""Dang"". I found that the author was unable to create her male characters with a realistic male perspective. Other than that I found Chocolate Star to be pretty interesting."
4,A good very read,"I really enjoyed Chocolate Star. Shelia really brought the characters to life. I just ordered Chocolate Affair, I hope she makes a 3rd. Work well done Shelia, please keep them coming!!"
4,Good book!,I really liked this book. Better than I expected and the character of Topaz--not enough fame and fortune can make you happy.
4,I like Chocolate Star.,I like how Ms. Copeland wrote such a clean book with no profanity or any raunchy sex scenes. I liked how she made the character Sean a Christian and how he stayed with his religious belief to remain a virgin until he married. And there was another thing about the story that I liked that the author made realistic: Like when Topaz ran off and left her husband and child to start a singing career. And she would always put her singing career first before her family. Then she started sleeping around with other men when she already had a husband who really loved and cared about her. But she took advantage of him. And then at the end of the story she ended up with nobody. Good book Ms. Copeland.
4,New and Fresh,I enjoyed reading this book. Yet the book left me hanging as far as Topaz. I hope there will be a sequel to this book where Topaz finds her way to true love. I would also love to read more about Sean and his loving family and friends. I will continue to look for your next book(Part II).
4,"""I WANT TO READ MORE BOOKS FROM COPELAND!""","The thing I liked the most about this book is Sean Ross. It is about time that a character with Chrisitian values is presented in a book. I hope more characters such as Sean Ross appear in more books, TV and movies. He struggled with his beliefs, but he still held on to his faith. The other two characters tried to base their happiness on material things only and they were not happy in the end.I hope Ms. Copeland continues the story of Topaz."
5,A PAGE TURNER!!!,I really liked this book and it's characters. I thought they were very diverse and interesting. I wanted to know more about the characters at the end and stayed up until three in the morning to finish it. I don't think it was overwritten and references to the importance of christian values and principles is very original. I have not read a book quite like it before and am very impressed. More books like this one please!
5,One of the Best Fiction Novels Ever !,"This book will touch the hearts of young and old as they realize there's more to fame than just fortune. After reading this book I realized that being Afro-American and famous doesn't make you a Chocolate Star, It starts in the heart of the person."
4,Great for KVMs,"Product worked great with a second-hand KVM. If you have enough VGA or DVI cables, but not any M:M PS/2 cables, this is just what you need, and for a decent price."
5,looking for something,"a little gray burro that lives in Ecuador contemplates the world.he travels to see cattle boats to cocoa beans, & even Ecuador's capital to gold mines, and more. he finds that his search was for the place he came from in the beginning. cute tale"
4,Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?,"The good thing about this is that it's an excellent time capsule of a music form that has sadly become a joke. The best is saved for last with the Ramones. What should have been the best performance has been slightly marred with the partial censorship of Wendy O. Williams spray painting ""Fornicate me, Status Quo"" on the soon-to-be sacrificial Chevy Nova while the Plasmatics blaze through ""Masterplan"". Spliced in is Richie Stotts' foray into the audience from the previous song ""Head Banger"". Wendy O would throw up in her grave, as the Plasmatics hepled pave punk and this is an insult and blasphemy to boot. Also, there are two numbers (The Jam's Funeral Pyre and Iggy's TV Eye) that are brief due to being played at each show's end. Otherwise, it's an excellent time capsule for punk. Now that Tom Snyder has passed on, it's even more so a time capsule."
3,Three Steps Behind,"Yes, likely for legal reasons this release is missing performances by the Clash and U2. But there's a third significant omission: Split Enz (performing ""One Step Ahead""). An important appearance also for the fact that it inspired Neil Finn to write a song about their encounter with another guest that night, Sandy Allen, the world's tallest woman (see the clasic album ""Time + Tide"")."
5,Show me the Clash,"Why was The Clash not included? Anyway, I have been waiting for years for this Show to be on DVD. Plasmatics made two appearances, the first was the best with ""Butcher Baby"". Tom brought us some great times late a night. Hope to see ABC's ""In Concert"" and more ""Midnight Specials"" later on DVD."
4,No Clash???,How can the wonderful June 81 interview and debut of Radio Clash be omitted?? Can't be a CBS/NBC thing because Elvis Costello was also on CBS? Worth the cost if only for the Lydon/Levine Interview but did we really need the entire show for the night each artist was on? Space would have been better used for bonus features (I hear the banter during the commercials was particulary brutal between Tom and Johnny) or more artists (Clash). Looks like a quickie editing job to cash in on punk nostalgia.Addendum. The Clash appearence is available on the following:http://www.amazon.com/Live-Revolution-Rock-Clash/dp/B0013K6WN0/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1252087234&sr;=8-5
4,Reminds me of music from the 1960s,"I actually bought this CD because of one song (En Mi Cielo) that I heard in a movie I have on DVD. That song remains my favorite on the CD, but I like pretty much every track. The overall ""sound"" of the CD is, for me, reminiscent of songs or artists from the 1960s. The only complaint I have is the several minutes of silence in the final 10+ minute track."
2,Not that comfortable,"I bought this to replace an old gel seat that I've had for about ten years and that was finally giving out on me. Right out of the packaging, this Schwinn seat looks like it would be very comfortable, but it's got a hard base underneath that makes it feel like I'm riding on a layer of wood.Also, the product description says that it is designed for ""spin bikes"" and doesn't say that it's made only for Schwinn spin bikes, so I thought it would be alright to use for my Phoenix spin bike. However, it keeps moving and shifting around when I use it, even when I pull the draw strings as tight as possible. This movements ends up causing some chafing on my inner thighs, which is certainly not a pleasant thing.I'll continue to use this since I can't return it since I've used it a few times, but I'm not that impressed with it and would suggest looking at another brand."
4,Great for spinning,"Today was the my first spinning class in about 3 years and I brought this thing along with me. I expected to be sore but I'm not. This also fit the spinner brand bike perfectly, no sliding around. I'm a big gal and this made those tiny seats manageable. I was very happy to buy this instead of buying a ton of expensive padded bike shorts.I compared several brands at the store and this one had the thickest, yet hardest, padding. The others looked too squishy and soft and I was afraid they wouldn't support me more than a month or so before they just gave out. Only time will tell with this one.Edit: It is still very supportive as it is holding its shape. The logo on it wore off long ago, but that's no biggie."
2,Okay Product,"This would be a really good product if it fit the seat on my bike. After reading some of the other reviews, I had some doubt about purchasing this item. A lot of people were talking about outdoor bikes and spin bikes, and how the cover did not fit. I have a Schwinn Stationery bike, so I thought maybe it would fit because it was a different type of bike. Wrong answer, the width of the cover is not wide enough and the length is not long enough. I was very disappointed. I am just going to detach my seat and take it to a bike shop where I can purchase the right seat cover for it."
3,A good gift for your princesses,I bought this book when I was a teenager and found it helpful. It does need some color pictures.
1,Don't waste your money,"This is not a good book for all young African American girls. all of the girls have make up and chemically treated hair. This is not OK if your trying to teach your young princess to be happy with who she is as she is NOW. That is if you don't allow your teenager or preteen to wear makeup, and your don't allow her to chemically treat her hair. I didn't give my child this book, nor will I re-gift it. Hope this helps moms that are raising daughters to appreciate their natural beauty."
2,really?!?!,A non-black friend asked if this was an appropriate gift for my daughter. She was concerned that there were no photos of girls with natural nappy or kinky hair and styles and while pretty - all of the models were medium to light brown. We have been friends a very long time. teen age girls are so sensitive and impressionable. we have to be aware of the messages we send to them. I am not comfortable with this message for my daughter.there is a very short section on natural hair ' which is difficult to manage'. REALLY?!?!?!
4,"Lo-Fi Folk Masterpiece, From Miami?!","Iron and Wine, as previously stated, is the genuiousness of one guy and a four track recorded in South Florida of all places. The sounds of the album are mostly slide guitar, banjo and an occassional mandolin, which give the album a real warm southern feel. ""Bird Stealing Bread"", with a simple yet catchy melody, is quite focused and the slide work on ""Southern Anthem"" is especially remembered. Best enjoyed on a front porch with unsweetened ice tea."
5,Wonderful album - I recommend it to just about everyone...,"A peaceful little album reminiscient of Nick Drake's Pink Moon that I have played over and over and over. Great background music for just about any occasion, and I always have people asking me what/who it is I'm playing so they can pick up a copy for themselves.This album sells itself. Sam Beam is a genius."
3,Campfire conniseur,"Ragged folk articulations goes down smoothly with Beam's laid back approach and studied strummings, though his debut here is a little too minimally lo-fi to create any splash larger then a reasonably sized puddle."
2,Misleading reviews,"The comparisons to Will Oldham and Nick Drake in various reviews, including the editorial, got me hooked as I really like their work. Having listened to the album I am underwhelmed and feel that the reviews were very misleading. Where are your heads at? He is not like them at all! Iron & Wine is far more naieve and sentimental in a sincere singer-songwriter sort of way. In fact he is more reminiscent of Irish troubadour David Kitt, which is fine if you are into that sort of thing, but he is no Will Oldham. If you are a fan of the latter - approach with caution - have a listen to it before you proceed to checkout! It is unfortunate as I will be much slower in future to take a flyer on new artists on the basis of Amazon reviews."
5,B ... bi ... bitt ....!!!,"Bittersweet!!Arghhh!!!I was going to try to write a review of this excellent, beautiful, haunting, and moving album without the word bittersweet. Too late. I heart Sam Beam. He sounds like he doesn't get out much but has a rich inner life, which I can pretend to identify with."
3,Not so bad,"Unoffensive, good backround music, lyrics dont do much for me, singing isnt bad, but there is only 1 Nick Drake, and he could play guitar. At least he doesnt sing about as depressing stuff like Nick but hes still going for that voacl aesthetic."
2,Simply boring,"I picked this one up after reading some glowing reviews on Pitchfork and Amazon. Well, it just goes to show you that Pitchfork can't always be trusted...this music is simply boring, folky music that puts me into a coma every time I try and listen to it in it's entirety. I'll admit that he has a gorgeous, rich voice, but the production is so lo-fi that I can barely make out half of the material, and the music itself is dull and monotnous. All I could think of listening to him was that he sounded like Jack Johnson, which is NOT a compliment, sitting in some liberal arts college quad strumming mediocre folk songs about peace and love on his guitar. I cannot for the life of me understand why this album is praised so highly. Too bad...I was really looking foward to hearing it the first time around."
2,Overrated and sleepifying,"This CD is certainly inoffensive, but hardly justifies the too-fulsome praise it has garnered here and elsewhere. Think ""O Brother Where Art Thou""/Uncle Tupelo, but a lot slower and less interesting. As a co-worker/co-music critic suggested, it is perfect for lying in bed and reading, trying to fall asleep. Otherwise really not worth it."
2,Better Than Sominex,"I bought this album after reading all the reviews here figuring this is right up my alley. I mean I love acoustic Dylan, early Bruce Cockburn, Nick Drake, all of that. How could I not like this? Maybe because it's mind-numbingly boring and tedious? Also perhaps because the lyrics are often half-baked and meaningless? If I'm ever brain damaged in an accident I will instruct my wife to play this cd when I become agitated; I believe I will be much more receptive to the ""genius"" so many people here admire. But as I am now in full potential of my critical faculties I have about 500 other cd's more worthy than this."
3,"Wow, how soon forgotten","Beam is a DONOVAN CLONE, right down to the faux Welsh accent. Nobody around here seems to be catching on, however, instead making absurd correlaries between he and Elliot Smith and Leonard Cohen. It couldn't be clearer. And as for the 'subtle swirling imagery', try ""Barabajagal"", or, for a real eye-opener, listen to ""Atlantis"". JEEZ! This is more of a tribute band than anything else. If you've ever heard him do the drastically re-worked version of Postal Service's ""Such Great Heights"" (now the soundtrack to an M&Ms; commercial for all of you who think his Art is untouchable), it becomes completely obvious. It's a total Leitch cop.Now I'm not saying he's bad, on the contrary, but puh-leeze, get real, kids!"
4,"Great Songs, Lousy Sound","This is an extreme case of good news and bad. The good news is that Samual Beam has written some wonderfully original songs (in the Americana tradition), and sings and plays with more than adequate ability. The bad news is that the sound reproduction on this CD is [bad], and it ultimately makes it hard to really enjoy the songs. I mean this CD makes Nebraska sound lush. A mercifully short test on the headphones confirmed my initial fear: this thing isn't even in stereo. It's like listening to an old 78 rpm record - scratchy and distant. So buyer beware. The pleasures on this CD don't come without some pain."
1,Decent music handicapped by horrendous sound quality,"Hard to enjoy the music when the sound quality is so so bad. Very limited dynamic range and bandwidth and poor resolution of details, even for a home 4-track recording. Has been compared to Nick Drake but even his recordings from 40 years ago allow the emotion to come through unlike this one that is limited by poor production."
5,Beauty,"All iron and wine albums have a crazy way of painting a beautiful masterpiece in the mind, with your eyes closed and fully focused on the music its almost like letting yourself get lost in your most beautiful dream. Upwards over the mountain, is an amazing song. I fell asleap after listening to it and it just sets me at so much peace. This album slows life down for you in a way that nothing else can."
2,Knee Highs Definitely Stay Up!!,"These QUEEN size knee high nylons with cotton soles will DEFINITELY stay up for you...in fact, they will almost cut off your circulation. I bought them for my mother for a gift. She told me she couldn't use them as they were so tight, so she told me I could have them. I have the world's skinniest legs (literally NO calfs). That being said...these QUEEN size knee highs are so tight on my skinny legs that even I cannot wear them. They are so tight that they almost cut off my circulation and caused excruciating pain from the tightest band in the world at the top! It is too late to return these, or I would. Do NOT waste your money! The company needs to go back to the drawing board on this product!!"
5,I'm not a fan...,"I've never been to a show. I've not even made it through this entire album in one sitting. Generally speaking, I'm not a Shakespeare's Sister fan,That said, I purchased this album for one song: The acoustic version of ""Stay."" Having listen to just about every genre of music for these last 30+ years, I can honestly say that this tune haunts me more than almost any other song I've heard.I can't tell you what it is about it. The emotion just feels so real. The sentiment so beautiful, while at the same time dark and morbid. I must have listened to it thousands of times by now, after stumbling upon it over a decade ago on college radio.It's been said that the power of music is in its ability to move a person. Well, if you want to be moved, then buy this album. That one song alone was worth the price for me. It's rare and hard to find anywhere else. I highly recommend it."
3,Wasn't very impressed...,"If you like their album ""Hormonally Yours"" you have about a 50/50 chance of finding this album enjoyable. I wasn't very impressed overall, but it did have a few catchy beats."
3,does what it promised,"does what it promised, and was delivered timly, great for smaller projects not so much for contracting jobs.It works great it tight areas"
5,Two more songs then the original US release,"An excellent addition to anybody's foghat collection! the first cd is 43 minutes and the second cd is 45 minutes, IJWTMLTY is a differant version then what was on the original Roadcases release, also all the in between song ""speaking to the crowd"" by Lonesome Dave is not on this version of Roadcases, my only complaint is that ""Its too late"" and ""stone blue"" are recorded at a little lower volume then the rest of the cd! but overall its an excellent cd"
2,Personalized with STICKERS! And crummy ones at that...,"We received this order only to find out the already relatively cheap life ring was personalized with cheap stickers. These stickers were already peeling off upon removing it from the shipping bag! You can tell they were put on my hand because they were not even straight. Wow. $49.99 for a $5 life ring and 20 cent stickers. They did offer to take it back, or this would be a 1 star, but we're still out the $10 shipping. Avoid. Get a sharpie and make your own. It would probably look better anyway."
5,A spellbinding adventure into the revolution of self-renewal,"This book, plus Jesse Anson Dawn's The Rejuvenator's Bible, are roller-coaster rides into the anti-aging revolution of physical protection and renewal. ""Imagine having nothing on your hands but your destiny,"" said Henry Miller, and anyone who cares about their mind/body destiny should do themselves a favor and buy this and Jesse Anson Dawn's other book as well. He's the one to read."
5,The Devastating Truth,"Fans of David Simon who are preparing to mourn the imminent end of The Wire on HBO should definitely check out this massively powerful book, if they haven't already done so. Simon and Burns's impressively detailed and nuanced depiction of one year on a drug corner in an impoverished Baltimore neighborhood grows into a scathing indictment, not only of the narcotics business but of a failed criminal justice system as well. This is not light reading by any stretch of the imagination, but well worth it. A hard book to forget, and that's a good thing."
5,A Very Important Book,"I think everyone in the United States should read this book. The authors put the reader on a West Baltimore corner looking at it through a first person perspective. I don't think we can understand our society and the policies we try to implement unless we understand the people these policies are directed towards. This book puts a face on the truly poor, the drug addicts, and those trapped on the brutal drug corners of many cities. The book shows the reader how so often the policies adopted by elected officials and idealogues miss the point and end up failing. When we understand the lives of those of the bottom, only then can we help them."
4,A wonderful analysis that goes a might too far,"This book is truly a wonderful work. The authors managed to capture the essence of the corner and its entraping qualities. I found myself helplessly attached to the characters. The book, however, does indeed go too far into public policy. The authors' analysis leaves much to want and tends to generalize the problem and places blame is the conventional places. Overall, though, the book is a marvelous read. Be prepared, the plot is quite addictive if you can get through the occasional policy bashing."
5,The Corner was one of the most amazing books I've read.,"The Corner was an moving, thought provoking book. It changed my perspective on inter-city life completely. It made me realize just how real these people are and how difficult it is to get out. The struggles of addiction and the everyday struggle to just surive was excellently reported by Simons. How could you not feel for these people? A truely amazing portrayal of human life."
3,Corner,"The book was advertised as used, almost new, but it didn't look very good. Kind of shabby, but the shipper discounted my order 10%, so that was agreeable."
5,The Best Book in the World,"The corner is a good book to read. It is about a family (mother, father, and 1 of the sons') who is on drugs. Then slowly they get there life together, except the father died. There was also a 6 movie mini series about this book on tv channel HBO."
4,--A short version of the battle--,"This is a brief, but good historic account of the Battle of Bull Run. There are simple illustrations in the book and Zachary Kent, the author mentions all of the main Confederate and Union officers who participated in the battle. He also explains how General Jackson received the nickname of Stonewall. I thought that the quotes from various soldiers were quite interesting. Those quotes reflected the personal thoughts and feelings that some of the men had experienced during the fighting."
2,some real oldies,"Many of the songs are real obscure recording. Most are the B side of her hits. Although she can't do much wrong, skip this one."
5,Underrated gem,"A made for TV film that boasts wonderful acting and a script that both visualizes and honors the thought provoking work (of great depth), which provides the title.Leaving the plot description for others - a thought:It is evident that the team responsible for this film treated the content very seriously, this is a work of love.This film had somehow found itself buried under years of lesser films, and seen by too few - but it is a gem.A recommended choice for viewing - and a buy if ever it appears on DVD."
4,needs to be on dvd,"I agree that this was a very nice adaptation of Brave New World. Nimoy is fabulous, perfectly cast, if not quite true to the book, and the story of John the Savage and the depiction of the culture was spot-on. It is VERY useful for classroom work on the book.Highly recommended and wondering why it isn't available on DVD?"
5,some of Dwight's best!,"what can I say? It's Dwight and the CD is a real showcase of his talents! great music, as always"
5,Glory of This,"I read the review above and found it doesn't really do the CD justice. Personally I really enjoy the sound of 'Glory of this'. I am new to the whole 'screamer' scene but I really enjoy this. I have listened to some harder screamer as well as some softer stuff but something about this band just really works for me. As for Rick Anderson's opinion on the use of 'this' I don't agree. I do agree with the fact that they are not the only band that talks about a general topic, but, I enjoy this because it can be taken how ever the listener wishes to. The listener can relate to the singer and the music.Overall, I really enjoy this album and would strongly suggest you give it a try."
2,Don't always work! Disappointed.,"I loved the idea, but was very disappointed that 1/2 the case of 12 was not working!Without the light, it is not exciting to my littlr girl and loses it's purpose.Disappointed.Stacey"
4,Cute!,"All of the toothbrushes I received were in working order.My daughter loves the glitter inside, and loves the blinking mechanism (we've used Firefly toothbrushes for a while now.) The characters inside the little ""snow globe"" are a little odd looking (I wish it were a more gender-neutral, plain firefly!) The wide handles are very easy to hold onto.Each toothbrush comes w/ its own stand...a pair of cartoon-style feet! The stand is cheap plastic, but its adorable and does its job.I still think I prefer the plain Firefly brushes as they are less gendered."
5,Remember,"This book was very nice reading about the history of Alanon and AA. I really liked reading into the life of someone else with issues. Years ago, it is refreshing to see that others have similar concerns."
4,Alice gets better with age!,"It seems Alice Cooper's music keeps getting better every time he makes a release. Some people may find the lyrics too dark and offending, but if you put them aside, this c.d. is one of the best releases of the year! Alice has always been controversial, but always seems to put out great material. My favorite tracks would have to be ""Sex, death, and Money"", ""Dragontown"", ""Sister Sara"", and ""Every woman has a Name"". Like ""BRUTAL PLANET"", this c.d. has the same sound and is a great follow up! To any fan of Korn, Disturbed, or Godsmack, I would suggest you check out Alice's Music. He certainly still Rocks!"
5,Alice Ain't Britney!!,"Dragontown delivers great songs. I think Alice once said that ""Poison"" was one of his more 'sophisticated' recordings...I think ""Sister Sara"", from Dragontown, is about the most sophisticated song he's recorded. D-town is in my opinion MUCH better than Brutal Planet, even though there may be a few 'missing' riffs. It has moments of brilliant satire, such as the line regarding the combatment of vulgar entertainment: ""I was so offended as I sat for THREE HOURS / It was mental cruelty / I was so shocked!"" Alice's voice shines brilliantly on ""Every Woman Has a Name"", which is one of the best pro-femme songs ever written. ""Sex, Death, & Money"" should be made into a high-dollar video & splashed all over MTV....but then, Alice ain't Britney!!"
3,Dragontown,"Though an album should usually stand on its own, I can't review Dragontown without comparing it to its predecessor, Brutal Planet. Dragontown has a few good tracks, but it's not as catchy as BP, and light years from achieving Brutal Planet's brilliance. As other reviewers have said, it feels as if something's missing on most of the songs. Great tunes: Triggerman, Deeper, Sex Death and Money, Somewhere in the Jungle...Decent Tunes: Fantasy Man, Disgraceland, I Just Wanna Be God, The Sentinel...: Dragontown, Sister Sara, Every Woman Has a Name."
5,Alice Cooper: DRAGONTOWN,"DRAGONTOWN is the newest album to be released by shock-rocker Alice Cooper, and it is much better than I thought it would be than when I first heard that he was putting another album out. DRAGONTOWN features 12 hard-hitting, hard-rocking songs, including ""Triggerman,"" ""Sex, Death, & Money,"" and ""DisGraceland,"" just to name a few. My personal favorite song on the album has to be the title song ""DragonTown."""
3,A Watered Down Brutal Planet,"I was a little disappointed with this record. It seemed just like a watered down BP. But it was still pretty good, with a few tracks that were good. Not as many as in BP."
4,Continuing to crush in a suprising metal style!,"This album came out really suprisingly fast after the Brutal Planet album. Like it, it is very similarly very heavy and almost full on metal sounding in style. It is pretty good really, it grows on me it seems over time getting better. Very cool, and great for an artist who has put out so many albums it is greatly fresh and rocking. Excellent heavy rockin stuff from the legend shock rock creepy king."
4,Alice Does It Again,"For more years than I care to remember, I have listened to Alice Cooper. There have been average albums, good albums and great albums. Don't get me wrong, I think Alice is Godlike, but sometimes he doesn't quite hit the mark. Brutal Planet was too heavy and the Eyes of Alice a backward step. I love Dragontown, it has the bite, the humour and orginality that has made him THE top rocker for many years. Poor Sister Sara? Hahaha, what else would you expect from the Master! Deeper & Deeper, the heavy beat, Dragontown the track and the album, a must for anyone who has a soul...or perhaps an appointment somewhere?Don't bother with the Special Edition, just get this, Brutal Planet and all the others! Alice Rocks and Alice Rules!"
3,Go Down In Dragontown,Ok so its not his best but its still a good listen...This is the next album in Alice Coopers Brutal Planet Trilogy. I like to listen to all of them. A great album to listen to the first track is my favorite the hardest rock anthem on the disc (IMO). If you havent listened to Brutal Planet get this album and prepared to be blown away. If you listened to Brutal Planet before dont expect much from this album but I can bet it will still be a good listen for you. Alice still puts on a good creep show at his old age.
4,great..,"Most of the songs are heavy- Triggerman,Deeper,Sex death and money,fantasy man,somewhere in the jungle,Disgraceland,sister sara,i just wanna be god, and the sentinel... Its much too late is kind of like his classics. and every woman has a name is a ballad."
4,"Alice, Why Have They Abandoned You!","Commercial radio has ignored this CD and the last. This is good hard rock music but Alice has lost his popularity. If Alice Cooper reads this review, please write some music like the old days, so I don't have to hear ""Schools Out"" 20 years from now!"
3,Solid Follow-up,"I got this and Brutal Planet recently. I'm not sure which I like better. Dragontown works far better as a whole and conceptually, but I think Brutal Planet has more standout songs. In any event, this is a real solid album, worth picking up if you liked Brutal Planet at all.The style is not that completely similar. I want to say it's a bit less commercial and accessible, still hooky, but not as obvious. It's darker, feels a bit like a horror movie. Good solos too.The production is a bit better then brutal planet. Not as sterile sounding, and the drums fit in better, but could still be improved.The only reason I'd say you'd like it if you like BP is because it's a heavier, less commercial Alice. I really don't have a lot else to say about it, just that you shouldn't expect a masterpiece, but a solid effort."
3,Good Value,You get what you pay for. It’s a good drill for common home fix’s. The drill is lightweight but doesn’t have much power. You will have to recharge frequently since the battery doesn’t last a long time. For the small odd jobber it is adequate. If your looking for a longer battery life and power drill I wouldn’t recommend this model.
5,It's great for it's price.,"For $19.99, I have no complain about it.It dose everything a drill needs to do, and do the jobs pretty well too."
3,Okay For The Price,For drilling soft or thin material it's okay but it's slow top speed would not work for anything thick or tough.
2,Faulty item,I am in Australia and bought one from Amazon. The charger was faulty. Amazon asked me to contact Black&Decker. But I cannot send them any information because the site declined my message because I don't have State code filled in. Tried to look for the same input/output charger. Either the charger cost more than $20 or the cheaper ones are DC output. Donate $20 to Amazon... ...
4,black & decker Drill,"My husband wanted a light weight drill that, if dropped and damaged, he would not cry over. This fit the bill. It is inexpensive. It is not as powerful as his more expensive drills, but if he breaks it, we can afford to replace it. All in all it works out well for what he wanted."
3,Works OK but does not stand upright- balance off kilter,It ought to stand upright- but does not. Otherwise OK. Value was good. Have not used it on a project yet.
2,"OK as a screwdriver,but a drill it is not.","As a screwdriver it is adequate, but in the drill function, it drills too slowly to be adequate.It does not come with a screwdriver bit.The keyless chuck does not grip tight enough to use some drill bits."
2,not good not good,not good for heavy work is too soft I dont like it is only for very simple works!!too slow!
4,great for small things,"it was great but the drill broke on me, I would recommend getting something of higher caliber but that's just me . This will do for the little jobs but don't plan on using it for serious work"
2,"OK, not great","I just pitched one of these. After about two years battery would no longer hold its charge. Case is sealed. Batteries cannot be replaced. Works ok for many jobs, but its disposable."
5,A Great Drill for Home Use,"Although the drill requires the purchase (or possession) of a set of conventional drill bits to be used, the power of the drill is better than anticipated at purchase. It is a perfect drill for those ordinary household chores requiring a decent drill. It keeps its charge an amazingly long time and with good drill bits will bore through just about anything. I was a bit worried about the keyless chuck. Not to worry, when you lock the bit into place with your fingers, it isn't going anywhere.Because of the low price I didn't expect anything as fine as this drill. Although a carpenter, etc., might want something more powerful, for home use it just can't be beat. Don't let the low price fool you. It is a great drill!"
4,Good drill for occasional use,"I'm not saying it's bad for lots of use, but I can only speak for the way I use it which is for odd things around the house once in a while, works fine for me though something I was drilling no matter how tight I screwed the holder the 1/16 drill bit kept slipping. I bought good sets of drill & screwdriver bits. I gave it a 4 for that and because it doesn't come with a hard shell case, I should have read better but all the drills I see in the store seem to come with a case, and the only one I owned in the past had a case. I wish I could at least buy a case separately (if I can I don't know how, I searched the web, everything short of contacting B&D, maybe I will do that)"
4,Lightweight and works!,Great for little jobs and easy to lift and hold. We are very happy with this purchase. Used mostly for putting up curtain rods.
4,Excellent drill for the price,"This is a very basic drill that will get the job done around the house. It has everything you need as your standard drill.Pros:1. Long lasting battery. I have only charged it once (in the beginning when you have to) even though I have used it several times and still require no charge after a month of use.2. Very sturdy and the clamps for the bits are good.Cons:1. Does not have a torque setting. This is a plus on other drills I've had to keep you from over tightening something.2. If you do not hold the drill in place while you are unscrewing something, the clamps for the drill bit loosen a bit. I've had the drill bit fall out a couple of times because of this. It would be nice to have a stopper of some sort to lock the drill bit in place.Great product, great price. I recommend this to anyone who needs a drill to get your basic work done around the house."
4,Excellent,Inexpensive excellent product. Battery holds charge like any more expensive drill. I will purchase these types of drills anytime. Thanks.
2,This one falls down!,"Another disappointment from the ""weaker sex."" However, I am not upset that this drill is top heavy and falls over. I'm upset that no one, NO ONE, ever tbought to mention that you need to buy a drill bit along with the drill. The ""manual"" is also pathetic and totally incomplete. Okay ladies, go right now and give your man a huge kiss and hug. No one considers women as potential customers. Phooey."
3,A good budget drill with one major fault,"As others have said, it doesn't stand upright on its base. A very odd mistake (?) to allow into production. Apparently, you have to pay more money for the ability to stand it upright. lol? This is 7.2 volts, it's not a heavy duty 18 volt gun, so don't expect to be drilling through brick any time soon with this. Also, I wasn't expecting this to behave like an electric corded drill, with it continuing to spin after you let off the gas. This works great on drilling pilot holes in my plaster walls, which is the main reason why I purchased this. I've also easily drilled wood screw into base door trim, etc.. For $20, this drill does everything you'd expect a light duty cordless drill to do. -2 stars for the ding on my counter top when it toppled over. That was silly of me thinking it would stand on its own..."
3,This one will fall!!!,"Never a concern with B&D, this is a great drill with ONE fualt, it will fall over when in an upright position. (NO BALANCE) For the price, go for it, just watch were you set it, it will fall over...I am also going to write B&D about this problem.."
5,Good for the money,I bought this for the price and it seems to work well. I haven't really tested it on anything that requires a lot of power. Make sure you purchase driving bits or you won't be able to use it. They aren't included.
2,TOY -- not worth the price,"Even a FIFTH-GRADER would need a better tool.1. No replaceable battery - SO - when in MIDDLE of a small job, SHE GOES DEAD and you have to charge UNTIL TOMORROW.2. NOT variable speed - - I knew that when I ordered it, but, thought it would not make a difference - - IT DOES - A LOT!3. THIS tool SHOULD NOT have the BLACK & DECKER label on it - - it's like some of the REALLY CHEEZY STUFF I sometimes buy online from a DISCOUNT house.4. My poots have more power."
1,it sucks,I have had three in three years The charger never works it will not hold a charge. short term fine but do not expect any long term use.
1,Not enough power,This drill is okay for light wood drilling but if you have a serious job like drilling through hard wood or metal then this is not the drill for you. I recommend a 14 volt one for the bigger jobs or dont go cordless.These end up being throwaway drills because the battery dies after about 16 months and wont hold a charge then its cheaper to toss the whole thing and buy a new one then to purchase the battery for so much money.
3,flaca,for the price i can not complain but it could be better if it held the charge longer. but it is ok like i said for the price
3,Too heavy and bulky for me!,"I liked the fact that this was a reasonably-priced item (I purchased mine from WalMart). However, I've had the hardest time using it to drill holes in my small window frames because of it being bulky and a little on the heavy side. Yes, I'm of the ""weaker"" sex. I'll be taking this back. Can anyone recommend a powerful, yet compact, and reasonably-priced, cordless drill?"
5,Timely Delivery,"The product was delivered in timely fashion. I have no comment about the product. It is very standard item and I am not expecting anything spectacular from this item. It is a good and reasonable product, as expected."
5,Satisfied beyond words,Was very pleased with my selection and the items were gifts that my friends will enjoy for a long time.Pleased Customer
