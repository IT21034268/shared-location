4,Decent Quality,"For less than $50, these headphones are not that bad. There is a loud scrambling/fuzzy noise but that tends to happpen when the headphones have not been charged long, so I just make sure to put them on the charger when I don't use them. Also, you can just lower the volume on the headphones and increase the volume on the tv and that should help dramatically. And one more thing, yes unless you put the headphones on the charger a certian way, they won't charge. It's not that hard, I just drop the headphones in place and pick them up and drop them again until the red charge light goes on and it charges. It's not that hard..it takes me mayb 1-3 times to do (5 seconds at the most)."
4,Great product,"My husband loves this wireless headset. It is lightweight, has great sound quality and we love the call button. The only negative part is getting the ear cover back on after you put the batteries in. They could of did a better job of designing this part of it, we would definitely recommend buying it."
3,Good but...,These headphones are nice however if you are used to a home surround system they may not be for you. My husband says nothing compares to his BOSE 321.... I think he just needs to give himself some time. I like them because if there is complete uQuietness in the room you can still listen to the show and not disturb anyone.
2,Full of static,"I purchased these to listen to TV late at night when wife is sleeping; a compromise. These were the first wireless headphones I purchased and I'll be returning them ASAP. The static is just unbearable. They are comfortable to wear, but the static is nearly constant. Every once in a while, I'll get it to sound great, but with no movement what-so-ever, all of a sudden the static is back. Very disappointed. I don't want to deal with line-of-sight issues of infrared headphones, but I'll need to search for headphones that transmit the audio digitally instead of analog."
1,Baaaaad!,"Absolutely, positively, without a doubt, the worst sounding headphones I've ever put on my head. Imagine sitting in a back corner of your house, having those yellow foam ear plugs in your ears, and the stereo is playing in a room at the other end of the house. There is absolutely no dynamic range to these cans at all. I suppose they would be passable if you were listening to an audio book, but that's about it. You get what you pay for, so step up to some real headphones and drop these pretenders."
1,JVC Tv earphones,"It took three weeks and three contacts with JVC to make the product work, and then it only lasted two weeks."
2,Lots of static,"I purchased this because I will sometimes play my xbox after my wife is in bed and it would keep her up with the speakers on. I like the idea of headphones, however these are not the best one to get. The price is good, but there is a lot of static. I can hear the audio fine, but there is a lot of static, even when I turn my head jsut a little it will increase or decrease the static. I have the transmitter/charger next to the T.V. and only sit 10 feet away and still get static. I would not reccomend."
1,Betty Peters,"I am not happy with this product at all and I wish I had never ordered it. I read all of the reviews prior to my purchase and I thought I was buying a good product but I made a mistake. It has been several weeks since our purchase and we STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE HEADPHONES TO WORK! They did not come with any instructions, we had to get those online and when we did they were as clear as mud. The only thing keeping me from returning this item is the fact that I didn't keep the original packaging. I wasted $50.00 on a product I can't use. Needless to say, I am very upset."
1,Headphones did not work,"After struggling for several hours to figure out how to connect the headphones we called the manufacturer. The headphones are made by JVC and our television set is JVC, so it seemed that they would be a perfect match. Instead we were told that they were incompatible with our TV because ""it didn't have the same technology"". Interestingly enough, before we returned them in order to verify this we connected them to our radio, which was a different brand and they worked fine.So, I would recommend that if anyone is interested in purchasing this headphone, they contact JVC first.JVC HAW600RF 900 MHz Wireless Stereo Headphones"
3,Hard to dock the headphones,"It does what it needs to do. It was fairly cheap relative to some of the other options. I've owned these for a little over a year now. My wife has super-sensitive ears and gets annoyed at the TV when I stay up.Cons:- Replacing the batteries is a pain. Fortunately you don't have to do this often.- It's hard to dock to charge it. With a little practice you can do this relatively quick.- Several times now, it fails to transmit. I'll leave them on the dock and the next day it'll work again. Kind of annoying when you want it to work and it doesn't. I know it's not the battery because it's been charging all day and I've tried to switch the battery out before.- It picks up a lot of interference.- Not very comfortable to wearPros:- Relatively cheap- It worksOverall, I'm pleased with it. I'm still looking for a budget set that can solve the problems listed above."
1,fuzzy sound,"Just hooked up a pair of these I purchased last year so my warranty already expired. I suppose I'm old school and remember the big comfortable Koss headphones. The padding around the ears is small ( I don't have big ears ). As a result, there is poor fit-up. The 900Mhz wireless does not work very well and suffers from static and broken signal. Disappointed, normally JVC is pretty good. Stick with corded headphones with an extension for a clean sound."
1,Very poor signal to noise ratio,"There is a distinct hiss in these headphones at all times. I am really surprised, given the generally high quality of consumer electronics these days, that something this poorly performing would be on the market today, especially from a quality manufacturer like JVC.In my opinion, the sound quality would completely preclude listening to music, and would be barely acceptable for TV. While the signal quality is good, the noise level is unacceptable."
4,Very good wireless headphones for the price,"I bought these headphones so I could listen to music and podcasts while doing chores around the house and I am very happy with them. The sound quality is very good and the range is excellent. Despite their size, they are quite comfortable. I have worn them for a maximum of 9 hours at a time between charging and the batteries have lasted just fine. Unlike a couple other reviewers, I have not had any difficulty charging them. (You just line up the socket on the headphones with the charging tabs on the base.) There is occasional static when I'm near the edge of their range or near certain appliances (like a running microwave), but this is to be expected with any 900MHz radio device. All in all, these are very good for the price."
5,Satisfied,"This product outperforms with the price tag. If you are picky about perfect sound quality, this is not for you. If you just settle for FM radio quality and everyday use, 5 stars, no question."
1,jvc headphones,"In a word, this product is crap. Really it's not worth ten cents. After buying this product I have made a mental note to never buy a JVC product again.You unlike me, have been warned."
1,Stay away from this item!,"Buyer beware! Item was shipped with a short in the electronics and had to return. Even though item clearly states that ""this is not returnable"", I returned it anyway, only to receive more problems. Stay away from this. I am refuting the credit card charges and plan on winning this one."
1,Mr.,Item purchased as gift for spouse whose hearing is fading; head phones intended for use while watching TV. Spouse declined to use them due to their bulk. Headset was returned unopened.
3,disapointed,The head set it self is good but the sound volume is to low. Putting the battery in is a chore if you have problems with your hands I would not recommended this product
2,Not worth your money,"My main complain about this product is the static background which is present most of the time and positions. When I move around, the noise can increase suddenly. I tried various locations for several day but still could not find a peaceful moment. May be I got a defective unit or it is supposed to be like this for a 900 Hz wireless headphone. I had no difficulty in charging the battery and recieving over a distance around the house, which is nice. No instruction came with the package. It took me some time to locate the batery compartment. Bottom line: the background noise is annoying. A cheaper corded headphone with cord extension may be a more practical option."
2,Go Sony,"These headphones are just OK. I have a comparable pair made by Sony and they are way better with regards to overall design, sound and distance. But these work fine for inside my small shop."
5,THESE ARE AMAZING,"I can now go to sleep without having to cover my head with a pillow while my husband watches late night TV. If he's up when I'm ready to fall asleep, I hand them the earphones and we both are happy campers. Only thing that bother's is once you locate your setting/frequency, it does not save it. Each time you use, you have to go through the settings to locate the clear and static free frequency again."
1,Returned this,"I purchased this to replace a worn out five year old Radio Shack model I was very happy with. It wouldn't charge on its stand. The batteries were a pain to put in per other reviews -having to remove the inner ear cover to get to the battery compartment led me to think, ""Really - this was thought to be intelligent designing?"". Putting the ear cover back on was equally annoying. I failed to notice when I selected it that it is not a stereo headset. The left & right audio out ports from my cable box had to be turned into one audio feed via adaptor in to the headset. There are several settings to then scan to try to hear the audio. All gave me nothing but static. (I had freshly charged rechargeable batteries). Tried virgin bateries and the headset would not latch and give a charging signal. Shipped this back. Went to Radio Shack and bought a nice model off the shelf that set up easily and works fine....for almost the same.price."
4,JVC headphones,"Very good product, once you figure out how to set it up use it. NOTE: The instruction book is in between the folded over cardboard backing in the molded plastic container(it's not obvious that the cardboard is a foldover). The sound control on the headphones must be turned way down to avoid static. Volume is then controlled by the sound buttons on the remote. Follow the instructions regarding the autoscan feature also."
1,Junk,Lasted on a shore time. Piece of crap. No more to say and hate having to fill in words just to submit
1,no los compren,"no sirven para nada, tienen una recepción muy molesta y los he probado desde todos los angulos, desde todas las distancias, con interferencias, sin interferencias, pilas nuevas, de colores de todas las marcas etc ... mal negocio"
2,head phones,"the head phones are ok, except to change the batteries, you must remove a fabric covering and it is hard to replace and will wear out quickly"
3,"Works good, but not what I expected","I bought the headphones to help me hear and understand dialogue on TV. Very Clear, Crisp sound, was expecting the speakers on the TV to continue to work so everyone in the room could hear as well. They do work well, I can understand every word, just disappointed I can only use them when noone else wants to watch TV."
2,Disappointing performance. Not Even Average Sound Quality.,"Purchased these looking for even average sound quality simply to have decent audio while not disturbing others either as they work or later in the evening when kids go to bed. Tried them on our old Toshiba set , which is quite old - but still working. No matter what channel- there is a constant crackling and hum att all distance ranges. I cannot get rid of this. I upgraded to a Samsung HD - LED system with a new, fairly high quality power strip with advanced filtering and surge protection. Among the numerous array of input/output connections, the Samsung actually has a phono out jack on the back allowing a direct and simple connection. Thought I'd give it a change with the new system> No difference whatsoever. I am not an audiophile so my expectations were modest. I still get static even when plugging into the output of the Korg 320 digital piano. To me this is unusable; I would not buy this unit again and will look for something else."
4,Like these headphones,The JVC headphones fit my needs. I'm ordering another pair for a friend of mine. Can't wait for others to try these out.
2,Wouldn't work,Headphones wouldn't work on my tv in my living room. It would only work on my other tv's that were connected with a converter box connected to them. ( Changing my tv's to digital). My tv in the living room is a much newer model and I don't need a converter box with it. They work fine on the older tv. I purchased the headphones for my husband who is hard of hearing. He only listens to the tv in the living room. I wish I had known this before I purchased this product.
3,JVC Wireless Headphones,"Easy to assemble, good instructions, but always a hiss in the background even though the transmit station is less than 3 feet from the headphones. All 3 channels have hiss. Not bad enough to return them, but I was suprised they did this after the other reviews I had read. Otherwise, very good sound quality for music."
5,Good Headphone,"I initially bought it from Fry's for 79, then I searched amazon, after I saw the price (with free shipping) I bought it right away and returned fry's later.The headphone arrived 3 days after I ordered it.It's comfortable to wear, much better than my old RCA infrared wireless(which broke after only a year usage). Sound is very good too."
2,"Great sound, a bit hard to handle","The audio quality of these headphones is good, but the power and channel buttons on the ear cones are too easy to press accidentally.Also, the headphones produce wireless interference with your head at certain angles.The headphones are big and bulky and make it hard to lie down and watch."
4,Nice Audio,It worked without a hitch. Good signal everywhere in the house.It would be better if it put out enough rf so it could be heard better outside the house.
2,Better than nothing,"This concept works fine but the static is horrible. I can only have the right ear covered, it is horribly irritating. If I am near the microwave while running, the static is even worse."
3,I'll Try These,"Only had these a short time so far works well. Better transmitter than others, head phones have better sound response. We will see how long they last."
2,Not the best,Used this product for approx 3 months then it suffered a catastrophic failure. Tried to contact customer service with JVC and could never really get answers. Not a good buy. Save your money and invest in more expensive unit that has greater service
1,Avoid,"This product was such a disappointment. It only worked intermitently. At times it word half way work, but the volume was so low it was difficult to hear. The problems started immediately. I have onwed this product less than 1 month and would not buy it again. I cannot reccommend this product to anyone."
2,Poor quality but it serves the purpose,"I use this item when my wife is sleeping, so I don't disturb her.The distance from the TV (where the base is) to the couch (where I sit, wearing the headset) is about 10 ft. The reception is usually good, but sometimes I get a lot of static noise, buzzing, etc. Sometimes it goes away if I change my position, and some other times I need to change the frequency because the buzz becomes very annoying.The battery life is quite good, but I noticed that if I leave the headset off the cradle, even if powered off, the batteries still run empty in about two days.I wouldn't recommend this model."
1,Didn't work,"It's hard to even give one star to something that didn't work right out of the box. I purchased this item after receiving a friend's recommendation, despite the numerous negative reviews. He was happy with his. I'm not. I got nothing but static upon completing the connection after following the set up instructions step by step. Tried two more times with same result. I tried plugging it in to a different receptacle. No luck there either. Returned as defective. Also, I hate the theft-proof blister pack it came in. I cut my hand trying to open it."
4,Good product,"Overall, I like this product. It included all the items needed for set up and connection to my stereo. The only thing I don't care for is how the cloth ear covers need to be installed. Be sure to read the directions first on the ear covers."
1,Junk.. Don't even consider,"I am usually a big supporter of JVC products. However, this item is an absolute disgrace to the name. I can't even give it one star. Poor sound quality, RF noise. NO range at all.Don't waste you money."
3,A lot of static,I purchased these for my 91 yr old grandmother and so far I can get them to work but if you move your head at all you will hear all static.
3,good for price,"these knives are a bit skimpy compared to the more exensive chicago sets, but overall a good value."
5,Wonderful Book for ALL Children!,"Even though we happen to be a Pagan family, any family would enjoy the history of the Autumn Equinox in this book. It's great to read what many ancient cultures did to celebrate the harvest and incorporate some into our modern life.Wonderful Native American Tale at the end. Buy with the Winter Solstice book. I wish they would come out with the Summer Solstice and Spring Equinox!!!"
2,So disappointed!,I absolutely loved this book from the opening sentence to page 150. Unfortunately there are 200 pages after that before we reach the end.What started out as so new and fresh turned into a potboiler. Every pat thing that could happen did!I was absolutely bummed when I got to the end of the book as I realized that the first 150 pages lost all of their magnificence in the dog's breakfast that took us the last 200 pages.
4,A pleasant visit,This book creates a fictional world which is an enjoyable place to visit and characters who keep you company in a somewhat old-fashioned and genial manner.
3,Not as good a story as hoped!,"It is not a story you cant put down, but a good story and good ending. some of the characters were not likeable, in fact annoying."
3,The Los Art of Keeping Secrets,"""The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets"" would have been much more entertaining if some of the heavy drinking of alcohol has been omitted. In 1955, which is the time this book takes place, I don't believe drinking among 18-year-olds was as commonplace as Ms. Rice thinks it was. In fact, at least here in America, it was illegal, as the legal age was 21. I would have recommended this book to others if most of the heavy drinking been had been left out. In my opinion, those parts were quite boring, offensive, and didn't add to the story."
5,"""Must Read"" Book!","This book is a throwback on the 60s era, and it is amazing! Set in England, two girls get to know each other by a twist of fate, and their lives become so interesting because of it. I can't give away the ending, but it makes you feel so good! If you are going to read one good fictional book this year, make it this one."
4,Sweet and Effortless,"This book sets up a quiet sweet world, a set of light fun characters, and then moves them gracefully across each other. It takes good care of the reader, and while the people suffer trials, there is never a doubt that things will turn out well for them. And that's good news, because you'll come to care about the flawed but likable people you meet here. The neat bow on the end was a bit too contrived, even for me a reader who likes a happy ending. Still, if you are looking for a book for a plane flight, or even just a free day where you can curl up on a favorite cushion with a cup of tea, you wont be disappointed with The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets."
5,A Fantastic and Beautifully Written Story,"Certainly one of the best books I've read in a long time.I honestly found this book just perusing through the bookstore aisles one day. I always read the first page or so before buying, so there must have been something about it i liked. I love how all of the sub-plots are interwoven throughout. I'd never heard of Johnnie Ray, but shortly after finishing the book, I noticed that his music actually came on one of my Pandora radio stations!I can only imagine the time it took to research all the elements of this story. It's given me inspiration for the novels I hope to write myself one day. I cant wait to read more from Eva Rice."
5,Guidance for modelling exchange rate,The book provides answers to the key issues on exchange rate modelling supported by empirical evidence. It gives a comprehensive overview of the econometrics technique used for modelling exchange rate from macroeconomic perspective.It is an essential guidance for those readers generally interested in the topic and those practitians actually trying to model the exchange rate.
5,Best Muzzle Yet,Easy to put on and it ltotally limits the dog from even trying to lick anything but it still allows the dog to drink with the muzzle on.
3,"PROVIDER IS GREAT, MUZZLE IS NOT","I have absolutely no complaints regarding the company that provided this item. It was delivered quickly, at an affordable price, and in great condition.The product, however did not fasten onto the dog too securely. The thin strap was quickly pulled down, then off by both the dog wearing the muzzle and her ""partner in crime."" I bought this to stop ""Angel"" from eating rocks. The basket part of the muzzle appears to be fine. I think, however, the fastening needs an additional strap...kind of like a horses' bridal would fit."
4,Basket muzzle,"It works great for my Husky. She has a nervous condition and will sometimes fight with my other dog, the muzzle stays put and doesn't slide off."
1,Once again going against the crowd,"Reviewer: mags from Concord, CA United StatesThis movie was HORRIBLE. I had seen the previews and thought it would be great. Although beautifully filmed, visually pleasing and a bit romantic, this movie stank. Afterwards, for reasons I cannot fathom, I read the book. The book was absolutely brilliant. For some strange reason, the people who collaborated to make this movie saw fit to massacre the book by completely changing the message and skipping important events and adding things that never happened in the book that certainly didn't add to the movie. The book was beautiful and poignant and had a better ending."
1,WORST!,"This has got to be the worst movie ever made! Trust me it will bore you to tears. I went to see this in the theater, and after it was done I felt I had lost 3 days of my life(I'm not kidding thats how boring it is) I dont recomend this."
4,"Great movie, but...",Redford's character may not have breached modern values in hitting on the married woman but he breached the values implicit in his tenured typecasting mold which made his potential homewrecker agenda a little tough to swallow. The infidelity thing did nothing to advance the theme but created an additional plot layer which at best weakly resolved itself and skewed the ending blandly.
1,movie review,When I got the movie I was unable to play it on the dvd. It was broken so it was unless to me.
1,Pure Nonsense Worthless,The behavior of the problem horse in this movie is totally Hollywood nonsense. The horse training showed in the movie was pathetic.
2,Very disappointing - Monty Roberts is the real one!,"Robert Redford was oustanding, as usual. The ""hype"" and anticipation surrounding this movie was the best part! I have read Monty Roberts' book, and am very impressed with his methods. I was looking forward to seeing some of these methods used with horses in the movie. It's too bad that this movie was titled ""Horse Whisperer"". It should have never tried to take that title from the real thing - Monty Roberts. I think the horse characters might have had 15 minutes in the whole movie. The rest was just another love story with a very sad, injured little girl as a twist."
5,Sad But Amazing,"okay first off this movie is awesome.what happens is Grace and her best friend Judith go horseback riding.When Grace and Judith(Kate Bosworth) are hit by a truck.Tragically judith and her horse are killed instantly by the accident. Grace isn't.Grace has to have her leg amputated and Pilgrim is severley injured. The vet wants to have Pilgrim euthanized to prevent any furthur suffering from his injury,but Graces mom refuses to...But Grace(Scarlett Johannsen) and Pilgrim are also emotionally traumatized by the accident. SO Grace's mother Annie(Kristin Scott Thomas)takes them on a road trip to see horse whisperer Tom Booker(Robert Redford).Can Tom help heal Grace and Pilgrim? to find out WATCH THIS MOVIE!!"
2,The best and the worst ever,"I read the book after seeing the movie. The plot became much clearer after the book. I didn't mind the length of the movie. I could have easily watched a longer story. The casting of Robert and Grace was excellent. They made the movie. Redford and Thomas had absolutely no chemistry. The romance part of the movie was never believable. In the book there was not a great age difference and it was handled much better. Annie was never a really likeable character. Her only redeeming characteristic was her love for her child and that only came out after the accident. Robert was a much better parent and more likable person. I could see him taking Grace and Pilgrim to Tom Booker instead of Annie, however, we couldn't have had a love story with the horse whisperer. The scenery is beautiful and the story is sad, haunting, beautiful, and unforgetable. The book was so much better than the movie"
3,UMMMM,"I know I am going to make someone mad by saying this, but I did not fully find this movie enjoyable. I believe that the supposed chemistry betweeen Kristin Scott Thomas and Robert Redford was nowhere to be found. The best actor in the entire movie was entirely THE HORSE. I wished to know more about what happens to the Horse than anyone else."
4,DVD price hike,"Why did the price on the Horse Whisperer DVD go up recently? It's a great movie and I was set to buy it, but then you raised your price. At this price - plus shipping and handling - I might as well just buy it at the store. When you run a sale on this movie please let me know. Thank you."
4,Good,"If you have an MTV attention span, you are going to find this boring. But having come of age before MTV was invented, I was actually capable of becoming absorbed in this ""slow"" movie. It was a little contrived, but is a good piece of work. And anyone who pukes at the idea of a woman in her 30's falling for a man in his 60's, is probably about 14 years old herself. (And I'm in my 30's, just so you don't think I'm a man in his 60's being defensive). Redford is as good a director as he is an actor. If you want a good piece of story-telling, this movie is your ticket."
4,Horse Whisperer,"This is a great movie and story. Horses have personalities, hearts and souls. It is so fascinating that some humans have the gift to reach them on this level. Don't believe in telling the entire story in a review. Reminds me of being interested in seeing a movie playing in the theater, then having someone spoil it by giving away crucial points or even the ending....it's annoying. Therefore, if you need to know more check other reviews.Robert Redford is a horseman and wonderful director. Other actors/actresses did a fine job as well. Story provided many levels of emotion and warms your heart. Was not really too fond of the climax though. Enjoy"
4,Gorgeous scenery,"This was an emotionally-charged story played out very well by the actors involved. It was a story of healing, and the Montana scenery was absolutely glorious. This movie takes you to a much slower pace of life than most Americans are used to. It was very enjoyable."
2,Too long!,"This movie was too long. The story plot was carried too far. Also I thought that it was sick, mid-thirties lady with a mid-sixties guy. I found the movie not at all sad. I mean the mom went out there with her daughter Grace and her horse Pilgrim. She had all of the wrong motives for going but ended up doing the right thing for Grace and Pilgrim. But my God! She and the horse whishperer had some weird affair. She did not do a good job raising her daughter. Grace is stuck with a desprate, lonely mother and a father who's trying to take care of his daughter while working. To tell you the straight honest truth this was not my type."
2,A Movie Gallery resale,I received this movie and was very disappointed when it arrived. It is a Movie Gallery rental and the labeling on the disc cannot be removed. Even though the packaging was acceptable the item should be identified as not original. The disc played through without a problem but I will not purchased from a company that does not represent its product accurately.
4,Tony's Review,"The movie itself was awesome! I've seen it before. Shipping was great and got here earlier than expected. The only complaint I have was that the audio was not in sych with the video. I don't know if it was the DVD itself or something going on with my laptop player or laptop audio/video settings. If you have any ideas, please let me know.Thanks much!"
5,A great movie for everyone,"I thought this movie was fantastic! I have read the book, and although the movie didn't follow exactly, it was still a wonderful story. Robert Redford and Kristin Scott Thomas are wonderful, the scenery is beautiful, and the story is heartwarming. I recommend this movie to anyone."
3,The movie was OK but READ THE BOOK,"You must read this book. The movie doesn't do it justice. I don't like the way the ending in the movie and the book are different. The scenery was beautiful. I saw Buck Branaman, he uses the same training techniques, and he was amazing. I saw some behind the scenes and Robert Redford worked with Buck. He even had a cameo in the movie. Unless you've worked with a horse I don't think you can truly understand how difficult they can be. Seeing the movie one time was enough for me but I plan on reading the book again."
3,The REAL Horse Whisperer,"His name is Monty Roberts. The non-fiction book available on Amazon is ""The Man Who Listens To Horses"". He first started talking to horses in 1947 after watching wild Mustang communicate in the Nevada desert. Get it, read it...you will not be disappointed."
1,A complete bore,This film had a hard time keeping my attention. I was bored to pieces. The ending was really bad. I don't have a problem with slow movies....but this one just left me wanting more than what it had to offer.
1,Two words: IT STUNK!!!!!,"I deal with horses every day of my life and I really wanted this movie to be good.....it was the biggest disappointment and worst movie I have ever seen. In response to the reviewer from Seattle, I did hate Titanic, but I am the least shallow, uncaring, miserable person you could ever know. I love my life. It is not at all miserable and I don't think you should be making judgments of other people you have never met. I'm sorry America, this movie stunk. It was the most poorly made and directed movie of all time. I'm sorry that the American people could have such lousy taste when it comes to movies (and presidents). By the way, the adultery in this movie makes me absolutely sick. It is wrong and immoral. (see the 6th commandment) For a REAL horse movie, check out Roy Rogers and John Wayne. They sure beat Robert Redford any day!!!!!!!"
3,Beautiful scenery but very weak on continuity and story,"Real life horsemen roll our eyes at the numerous continuity goofs in this film, such as the ever-changing shapes of Pilgrim's face markings, and so on.At one point, Annie and the Booker family discussed the virtues of ""black baldy Angus"" yet the roundup scene showed a bunch of mutt cattle of various breeds and colors.Please note: Monty Roberts was NOT the inspiration for the Tom Booker character. (...)Recommended reading to go with this film: Horse Whispers & Lies."
1,reeking of Hollywood sham,"The old Little House on the Praire view of the west, with Redford shot through six inches of cheesecloth and nothing but handsome, straight-talking honest folk in sight - no racists, or world wrestling federation fans in 4X4s, or gun nuts. This idealized version of Montana is contrasted with the city, with its neurotic vegetarians. (The movie, incidentally, is a paean to the beef industry.) Anyone who really lives in the country (I don't mean on a sprawling ranch like Rob Redford) will recognize the Hollywood sham straight off, but people must have their myths I suppose... unbearable."
1,deceived in florida,"I am totally unhappy with my purchase due to the fact I did not know what a region 2 dvd meant. Nobody I know as a matter of fact knew either. This should not be allowed to be sold in the U.S. It was a used dvd, on top of that, and I can send it back but it will probably cost me as much to send it back as it did to purchase the movie. It should be clearly stated what region 1,2 ect. means. I would not have ordered it if I had known it can only be played on European dvd's. I am disappointed and feel mislead."
3,Too many parts left out,"I read the book about three or four years before the movie came out and I loved it. However, the movie is totally different. There are a ton of parts missing from the storyline. It was definitely a let down. I think I would've liked the movie better had I not read the book first. I would recommend that you don't read the book before you watch the movie."
4,"Wonderful, sprawling story","I just finished watching the DVD version of this movie, and I was very impressed. The DVD is in widescreen and does a good job of capturing the scenic vistas of Montana. The soundtrack is also very good. The story is very engrossing and a pleasure to watch. If there is anything wrong with this DVD, it is the lack of extras, just a trailer. A making of the movie, or behind the scenes extra would have been nice."
5,My favorite movie of the year!,"I seen this movie at the theater and rented it on video, It is a wonderful movie. I recommend everyone should see it. I also seen Monty Roberts in person and agree that things could have been done different in the end of the movie that was'nt so tramatic to the horse, but it is a movie. I will be buying this movie to add to my collection."
5,Breathtaking,"I love the movie, it was wonderful. I deal alot with horses and think that alot of the things Robert Redford(Tom) was true. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did."
3,A great story that goes astray,"First, let me say that I really like this movie, despite its flaws. The concept is a good one, but I think it becomes strained with too much of the wrong things. The cinematography is wonderful. There are some panoramic scenes of Montana that make the scenes more beautiful. However, as touching and interesting as the story and characters are, I feel that they focus too much on the mother (Kristen Scott Thomas) and her life, and her affair with the Horse Whisperer (Robert Redford), not giving nearly enough focus to the injured daughter and her struggles. The story should be more about the daughter and her horse, and less about the mother and her busy life. But, still, it's easy to love a movie with Redford in it... his character is worth enduring the minor story flaws. Basically, a good movie, well worth seeing/owning."
2,Read the book,I was SO disappointed in the movie. I read the book and loved it. The author must have worked with horses because he understands them so well. I have never read another book that totally gets the way a horse thinks and acts. And then comes the movie. The horse was hardly the issue in it. All we see Redford and Thomas staring weirdly at each other. She is such a shallow character I had no idea why Redford's was at all intersted in her. I only saw the movie once and never plan on seeing it again. It's pretty bad when the best part of the movie is the beginning when Pilgrim and Grace get hit by the semi.
3,Not for those with short attention spans,"Thsi movie was okay, but that's about it. It was SO long(almost three hours), and it has to be a pretty good movie to get away with that length, and the Horse Whisperer just wasn't there. I love horses, and I love romantic movies, but the plot just moved too slow for me and the ending just isn't very conclusive. They never tell us if Grace's mom and Tom Booker end up together or if they decide to stay away from each other, and that really bothered me. Some people really loved this movie and I understand how, but I just didn't like it that much."
4,Good movie...,"If you're expecting a movie about a horse, then you will be about 30% correct. If you're expecting a movie about a horse whisperer, you will be 30 % correct. If you're expecting a movie about a family with problems that have to be worked out, you will be 40 % correct. If you're expecting a great movie no matter what, you will be 100% correct. It's not one of the best, and not one you can watch over and over again, but it is pretty amazing. The acting is wonderful, too."
1,RUBBISH,I am embarrassed to say that I actually watched this movie in its entirety. I usually like a romantic movie just not when it involves adultury.A married woman finds new love on a ranch with a horse trainer but decides in the end to get back with her husband. There you go. Don't waist your time on this seemingly endless movie.
2,hmmmm...,"Redford is wonderful, but I think the movie strayed from the book enough to change the way you feel about the characters at the end. I've got to stop reading the book first."
2,No even half as good as reading the book !,"Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie but I have to say if you've read the book, the movie doesn't do justice. For a 2 hour and 45 minute movie, I feel it could have been more like the book. They focused on too many other details rather than showing more of the two falling in love. The movie almost made Annie seem indecent, where in the book it goes into greater detail of her feelings and you want what she wants. I was dissappointed after viewing the entire movie. When it reached the end I felt I wasted those three hours. My suggestion... BUY THE BOOK !"
2,Arriving when?,"I discovered during the holidays that my family had never seen this movie. I ordered this product on Christmas Eve with a promise that it would be delivered by that Friday. In fact, they did not arrive to my family's house until three weeks later! Fortunately, this is the only incident I have had with Amazon, and it was FedEx, not Amazon at fault."
5,IN TIME for Christmas and GREAT condition,This is one of my mom's favorite movies. I thought she would love to finally have it on DVD instead of having to plug in her video player. She loves it!
3,"Wonderful cinematography, plodding pace","I'm a fan of both Redford and Thomas, but this movie didn't do it for me. The scenery was beautiful, but the film's schmaltz factor was too high for my taste. And at almost 3 hours in length, the movie would benefit from further editing. If you're in the mood for a long romance and you've got a few hours to spare, consider it...but don't go in with high expectations."
3,nonbelievable.......Too-much drama!,"The Horse Whisperer is amoung the many horse movies that falsely shows the ""real"" lives of horses and the people they live with. First of all, this movie spent too much time on the life of the mother and the fact that she could not be faithful to the man she married. Second, I noticed that from New York to Col. the horse stayed in the trailer. Stopping once at a motel with a corral. That in it's self is cruelty to animals. Robert Redford should have taken more time to prepare this movie, to make it more real than he did."
2,Overblown hocum,"This long, overblown drama is a dreary experience with the only redeeming quality being the beautiful scenery and cinematography. When a young girl and her horse are hit by a truck, her mother enlists a ""horse whisperer"" who can bring her daughter's horse back to health and he ends up healing the whole dysfunctional family. Why it takes almost 3 hours to tell this story is beyond me but by the end, about the only character I had any feeling for was the horse. Robert Redford is his usual cardboard self and Kirsten Scott Thomas is a distant unattached actress who brings little here. The excellent Diane Wiest is totally wasted and seems out of place in the whole mess. Be warned, this is a ""Lifetime"" movie in disguise!"
3,The lost message of this film,"There's a message that Redford is trying to subtly get across. Redford is trying to convey that the most important things in life (and to mankind) are simple. Relax, love one another, live where you want, do what you want, and know that in spite of all of that, you can still be respected.In a fast-paced America, we fight amongst each other for money, property, job status and damn near everything else. We even compete on the roads to see which one of us will arrive at the red light first!As the film points out, we have no time for realtionships with our children or even time to make home-made spaghetti sauce.This film was attempt to remind us that integrity is worth more than greed.Just my opinion."
3,DVD quality bad and it seems that there are scenes where parts have been cut out or missing.,"This DVD seems very grainy & dark compared to the first dvd I had of this movie. Additionally, there are parts in this dvd that are missing, such as when the daughter is watering the stock in the montana barn, she goes into pilgrims stall, he paws a bit then comes up to her and nuzzles her. This scene is cut short and you never see the nuzzle.Now as far as content, Monte Roberts will be the first to tell you that each horse is different and needs to be handled according to the horses feel and sometimes that feel will dictate that certain methods must be used to get across the full intent of what you want him to do, to include ropes, etc. Even Roberts will tell you also that he doesn't know it all and will always be the continual student of the horse. anyone that thinks they do know it all... well... enough said."
4,If you love horses you will love this movie,"Although this is suppose to be a love story, it takes a backsit to healing the spirit of both horse and rider who had a horrendous accident together and can't get over the memory. Beautiful landscapes and what life should be all about. Family and togetherness."
3,Not exactly what I had in mind!,"This movie was a dissapointment. I am a owner/lover of American Quarter Horses, and was thrilled when they finally appeared on the big screen. But as we all know it takes more than a horse to make a movie. I guess it was my bad that I read the book before I watched the movie. But what confused me the most, when I did watch the movie, was that so many of the good parts were taken out. The ending was different, and I felt that there was too much focus on the first half of the book itself. All in all it was a good movie, ""Justin"" looked marvellous as usual. I just feel that if you're going to make a movie about a book, try to change as little as possible. In the book Gulliver was a chestnut, yet in the movie he was a bay. Pilgrim was supposed to be a bay and he was a chestnut.People fall in love with the ending of a book, it's what makes them want the good ones turned into a movie. It's just a disapointment when the story you fell in love with is changed."
1,Forget it,"""The Horse Whisperer"" is for garage sale addicts who get rained out some weekend. Much of the character development, sub-themes, plot sequence and even dialogue is thinly disguised rehash of Redford's earlier movie ""The Electric Horseman"". ""TEH"" was good, or at least Fun, because it was fresh. But repackaging a lot of it to make ""The Horse Whisperer"" turned it into refried beans. ""Whisperer"" is even worse because quite a bit of the main plot simply defies all credibility. The supposed epiphaney of the unconvincing ""family' is so hokey and disingenious it should have somehow been filmed in crayon, not Technicolor. It did as well as it did at the box office for only four reasons. It had a large promotional budget, it had Redford's name attached, it had the word ""horse"" in the title, and there are plenty of garage sale addicts here. Get ""City Slickers"" instead. The theme is about the same, the characters are more interesting and it has some funny parts."
1,What IS this,"i'm extremely happy we rented this instead of bought it ..This has to possibly be the worse movie out of every horse movie i've seen so far. The characters, i think, are pretty dim. Nice try on being a redneck, there. The only part that i actually got into was the beginning to where she gets injured .. then i thought it started going pretty downhill. they don't pay any attention to Pilgrim's markings there .. he'll have a huge star, a little star, not really even a star and no star. You could think they would've put more effort into the movie, but i guess not. The horse shows some emotions and some of the things are alright, but other parts .. are just .. unrealistic. I wouldn't rent the movie ever again, i grit my teeth at it, its my opinion that you move to a better movie before deciding to spend your money on this ..."
3,not good for 16 X 9 widesreen t.v.'s,"The film is great!!! However I just bought a 16 X 9 widescreen t.v. and this film in its letterbox format has black mattes at top and bottom which each take up 1/4 of the vertical screen. The image is presented as it was in the theatre, but even on my 55inch t.v. is only about 15 inches in height. If you have a big-screen 16 X 9 aspect t.v. then stay away from letterboxed dvds. Anamorphic widescreen is what you're looking for...."
5,Robert Redford was outstanding in this movie.,"I think the Horse Whisperer was a five-star movie. It was such a delightful but romantic, warmhearted movie. I will watch it again and again.Also, I think Robert Redford is just as sexy as every."
5,Top horse film,"The artistry of this film is breathtaking. If you love horses, courage, and a little romance, this is the film for you. The characters are played by wonderful actors and the story is one you will never forget. Have some kleenex nearby."
4,Very Heart Warming Story,"Very powerful heartwarming story. I give this movie a four star rating only because there were a couple of technical flaws in the movie dealing with modern ranches, but not so much so that one should get bogged down with those. Tom Booker, ""The Horse Whisperer,"" demonstrates his knowledge of human and animal nature when he heals the damaged spirits of two humans as well as that of, Pilgrim, the horse. Well worth nearly three hours of your time to watch."
3,"Readable, but not great","I thought that although the book was certainly readable (I finished it) it wasn't particularly captivating or well-written. Parts of it flowed smoothly and parts made little sense and moved like molasses. Aside from that I agree with some other reviewers in that the racism (she automatically assumes every Arab she meets is a terrorist) and the sexism (well, maybe not sexism, but her coworker calling her 'baby' and her going along with it rubs me the wrong way) left a bad taste in my mouth. I love chick lit, but I think chick lit should still be intelligent and well-written, and this book is not."
4,Frustrated and fuming,"You know, I just love it when the user reviews completely ruin the ending of a book.You may hated the book but that doesn't mean you have to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet."
1,don't bother,"i enjoyed reading bridget jones, and thought i would like olivia joules. but the plot is predictable and the character a little over the top. helen spends much of this book reinforcing stereotypes, which i find annoying and close minded. just read bridget jones and don't bother with olivia joules."
1,Terrible,This book was absolutely terrible. Not a single character was at all interesting. I found myself caring less and less about the situation as the book trudged on. Are we supposed to believe that every man that meets Olivia is instantly in love with her? Yuck. I'd give this book zero stars if possible.
2,Really disappointing . . .,"I read this book with high hopes, but i was grossly disappointed. It is all about a woman who believes she has discovered an al-Qaeda operative and supposedly hilarious moments ensue. The plot was boring and predictable, and it was hard to lose yourself in it. There were also some scenes of grotesque violence. I have never read ""Bridget Jones' Diary,"" and if this is what Helen Fielding has to offer, I'll pass."
4,"Not perfect, but a lot of fun!","I've read all Fielding's books and I love her style of writing, so I picked this one up months ago and finally got around to starting it. It was slow going at first, but there is plenty to keep interested. By the 100th page, I couldn't put it down and missed a lot of sleep as a result! In typical Fielding style, Olivia is flawed but lovable, insightful and hilarious! I don't want to give too much away, but her mysterious boyfriend is probably one of the funniest male characters I've read in a while (although he's supposed to be a scary terrorist!) The whole effect was wonderful. Like I said, it's not perfect but a fun read... so I really don't understand the bad reviews. Buy it and enjoy it!"
4,Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination,"I've enjoyed all of the Helen Fielding books I've read mainly because they're a lot of fun; light hearted and a bit neurotic. This book was no exception! Although a bit far fetched, it was a fun read, with a mixture of romance and intrigue. The main character, Olivia, was irresistible -- her ""rules for living"" were so clever that I actually hear myself repeating them as I manage my day! I read it while on vacation and listened to the audio version (which was excellent!) while driving errands around town with my young children. This book isn't ""rocket science"" but was an entertaining and enjoyable trip which was a great escape from the day to day grind."
4,Good lighter for price,Very hot flame with a generous supply of fuel capacity. Great for lighting things but NOT for soldering.
5,This book is for those interested in transcendental aspects of human existence.,"Together with the author's other two books published in English subsequently, namely The Challenge of Fate and The Healing Power of Illness, this book tackles one of the most controversial subjects - reincarnation. This book is an essential reading for the seekers of truth about human existence, those who had realised that science is not truth, but only the best available approximation of truth at any one time in the judgement of the majority of scientists. I hope that this and other books from the author would help the sceptics to undergo the paradigm shift - one that is necessary in order to start recognizing the transcendental aspect of human existence."
1,Sky King Ramar of the Jungle,I am very disappointed I never received this movie and was never credited the amount that I spent.
4,Great CD!,I like the Bellamy Brothers' music and especially like this CD because it combines their voices with their guests - so you get to hear Howard and David AND singers like Dolly Partin and Alan Jackson. I love it!
3,an entertaining and complex film,"THE DAYTRIPPERS follows the classic ""hero takes a journey"": format...only this time it's ""hero and her entire family take a journey"". There are humorous and unexpected moments. The writer/director keep the focus of the film straight and true...this is a search-for-truth quest, and the quest won't be resolved for the characters until it is simultaneously resolved for the viewer. Greg Mottolla, in his first feature film since Columbia Film School, does a wonderful job. I hope he keeps up the good work and makes lots more independent, character/plot driven movies like this one."
2,"great cast but slow story, no more than slightly amusing","I'm afraid I had a different experience than most of the other reviewers so far on The Daytrippers.The movie has a great cast who have certainly proven their abilities in other films. But Daytrippers seemed to just do a basic setup for a road trip, then the roadtrip, then the confrontation/surprise at the end.Along the way we get to listen to some normal or eccentric family members arguing and talking (much like real life). But not much in the way of storyline or humor. A few smiles, no laughs, little plot. Some of the characters may remind you of people you know or relatives which could make it funnier."
5,This is one not to miss...,"I stumbled on this film because of my fascination (ok crush)with Liev Schreiber. What a great movie. Who would have thought that a movie about chasing after a ""might be cheating"" husband would be so entertaining. I love the continuing story of the novel about the Dog Head Man that Schreiber's character is telling. This is a fun and sometime sad movie. Try it out one Saturday night."
2,New transfer badly needed,"The film is outstanding -- Mottola's best, in my opinion.However, this review is of the DVD itself. The transfer is soft with a lot of compression artifacts that distort the image. The most glaring flaw, though, is that (like its region 2 counterpart) the film is presented in a 1.33:1 ratio rather than the original widescreen. I've held off on owning this for quite a few years, waiting for it to be presented in its original aspect ratio. Not at least getting the option of seeing the film's original framing as it was composed for theaters is a rare situation in the DVD (and now Blu-Ray) era, and I don't want to encourage this blunder with a purchase.Superbad and Adventureland were both pretty popular, so why no new release of their outstanding predecessor, with a nice anamorphic transfer?"
5,The Adventrues of Tom Sawyer (Cliffs Notes),"I purchased the Cliff Notes version b/c I didn't have the chance to read the book when I was younger and have heard it is a classic. Although I speculate the actual book would be more in-depth and more engaging, nevertheless you can still pick up on it's humor; which instantaneously brings me back to the days of my youth -with all the whacky adventures and decisions I made! It's a really fun read, especially if you're older b/c of its ability to draw on somewhat similar parallels to your own life -depending on how you were raised."
2,A curious recording that didn't quite hit the mark for me,"Certainly not my favorite Munir Bashir recording, this CD starts off very promising but falls short of what it could have achieved with the same material. The production is a little bizarre: it sounds like an ensemble recorded some really deep, rich performances in a small room with lots of reverb added later, then Munir Bashir came in and laid an oud solo on top - and the engineer grabbed the faders on the board and yanked down the ensemble to make room for his subtle, textural playing, then cranked 'em back up when the solo was done. Very odd. Could have been much better with an improved approach to the recording."
5,Kenny Rogers (Coolector's item),"The set of 3 CD's in the Kenny Rogers Collectors' Edition was a very very nice collection of songs. The songs were sung with feeling and the tunes, very beautiful. These are songs of previous years and indeed a treasure to keep."
5,You'll Want this Book,The stories that make up Autumn Passages are true Duck Hunting Classics. The book takes you through time providing insights from the earliest market hunting days to the rejuvination of duck hunting in modern times. The only thing more enjoyable than curling up with this book in front of a fire is living the stories yourself in a favorite duck blind.
5,Great Waterfowling Book,"This book spans a century of waterfowling tales. It is amazing to begin your journey in time when the skies were clouded over by magnificent flocks all the way to the present. Since it is a treasury by many authors from many areas around the country from different time periods, the reader is able to see many different waterfowling scenarios. After reading this book, it has made me want to buy the works of many authors included in it!"
1,Dangerous muzzle,"I got this muzzle to help me rehabilitate a ""dog aggressive"" dog who nips, or tries to nip me when he sees another animal.... he can take it off in just a few seconds - and he does. To my way of thinking this muzzle is dangerous because it creates the illusion of having secured your dogs muzzle and it may put you and your dog in a dangerous situation."
3,Pretty as a Picture,"The kulana Luhi Women's Cruiser is beautiful. I have one problem and that is that the seat has springs underneath the seat that keep squeaking and pushing through, which causes the seat to lean to one side. I'm an 'average' sized woman. Not magazine and model skinny but really average - size 12. So, I think the seat should be able to withstand my weight. Another thing that I don't like is the 'bullet' shaped hand grips. I think I'll end up changing them out and then that will solve that problem. That may be the favorite part of the bike for some people but, to me, they are just ugly. The plus's for this bike is that it rides really smoothly and the seat is very easy to adjust (height). The bike is a very attractive color. The handlebars are really nice and wide. If I had to buy it again, would I? Yes!"
3,Lots of parts to put together,"This is a neat bike, good for the price paid. Its not extremely sturdy but does the job for the low price. Its great for cruising around on level pavement."
5,Review,"The bicycle was a steal for the price paid. The size is perfect for me, and I am a 5""8 woman. I definitely would not recommend the size for someone much shorter than me.The two things that could have been better are: the bicycle was shipped with assembly instructions to a different model and the chrome was slightly dinged."
2,Not for Fitness,"Awesome art deco look, but not worth it. Bought one for me & for my 12 yr old son to ride for exercise, but was extremely uncomfortable with pedaling----too much resistance (I did purchase the Bell deluxe gel seat replacement--that was cool. Handlebars were a pain, too. Took it back and got a mountain bike with gears. :)"
3,cheap cheap cheap,"Light weight construction, and not in a good way. This is a small-scaled bike made of light gauge metal and plastic. The price is low, and so is the quality.You get what you pay for, I guess. If you're 5'6"" or taller, forget about it.I'd return it if I still had the box."
5,Understand God's Love,This book helps us people understand God's design for our life. He made us to love HIM and EACH OTHER!!!
3,Not Bad,"The book was ok. I've read both books and they are both informative. However, for some strange reason, I was able to determine my love language after reading this book than after reading ""The Five Love Languages"". Once I read the chapters discussing each love language....everything just made sense. Anyway, it's just my opinion. However, I must confess that after reading the descriptions of each language, everything else seemed kind of....I don't know....unnecessary is the best word I can come up with. It's like he was just finding something to write about.Well, I'm not a critic. In fact, this is the first review I have ever written....so please...if u are considering buying the book...go ahead...read it.. and judge for yourself. If you are closer to God after reading it, and if you have a better understanding of your relationship with Him... then the book is well worth the price and the time."
3,Accessible introduction to life of a great king.,A well illustrated general introduction to the life of a great medieval king and his campaigns in Wales and northern France. Examines the battle of Agincourt -- including material on the nature of combined arms warfare in the high middle ages -- and the events leading to the Treaty of Troyes. The author is careful to place dynastic struggles in context and his inclusion of a detailed family tree for the house of Plantagenet is a welcome addition.
3,Working great.,As with all memory they round up the number to the nearest standard size so instead of paying for 1.6gig ram wich is what you get your paying for 2gig. Other than that the ram has been working excellent. Although i did find out the 32 bit operating systems only support 3.65 Gig ram so I suppose its not a big deal that i got short changed on the actual size.
5,"Fit perfectly, worked immediately","I used this for an old macbook pro A1212 and it was extremely easy to install (having first checked out ifixit.com) and the OS recognized it immediately. I did initially make the mistake of not pushing it into the slot all the way, but once I figured that out, it was glorious."
5,Good addition,"My HP DV9207 came with Vista, and the specs said the maximum memory it could take was 2gb. Since I have Windows 7 on it now, I read online that the OS upgrade could read up to 3.5 gigs. So, I bought this 2gb stick, used it to replace one of my two 1gb sticks, and my notebook saw it immediately on rebooting. It's now using all 3 gigs now, and is definitely running faster."
1,not compatible with Asus EEE 1000HE,Installed and noticed that my computer was running slower than when I used 1 gig of Ram. Had to take this one out and put my old 1 gig back in.
2,Not good for the Asus eeePC 900,"This memory suffers the powersave ""lockup"" noted elsewhere on the eeePC. I'm confident it's fine for other applications, just not this particular one. I had purchased Kingston for compatability but failed, so this memory ended up being junk for me. I'm told Crucial is the brand to use for the eeePC 900. I'll definitely research better for my next stick. Downgraded to 512mb for now."
5,RAM Great,"I received the RAM promptly and it was easy to install and worked great, noticeable improvement!"
1,1 Gig missing,"I bought one Kingston KVR667D2S5/2G 2GB to install into a new EEE PC 1000 HA and when i brought up system properties, It only registered 1 gig of ram instead of the 2. I know for a fact that is is a 2 gig stick of ram (because it has 16 of those black things..) so i know this isn't some shipping problem, meaning the product they sent me is just defective."
4,Not for Asus EeePC 1000HA,For some reason on Amazon this memory is listed for the Asus EeePC 1000HA but does not work - its incompatible in the Asus 1000HA. Not sure why. I've used Kingstom for other PC memory upgrades and their products have been just fine - no problems over years of use - so I've given a 5 star for how they are fine if they are put into the right machine.
5,Kingston ValueRAM 2GB,"This was the easiest thing to do with my netbook, I have an Acer Aspire One D250-1165 and I was afraid to mess up my netbook by upgrading my ram.But like I said it was super easy, just stay clear of static and switch the ram!! It worked right away."
5,Excelent product,No complains. The product was in excellent conditions in its sealed package. It was easy to instal and worked perfectly.
3,Works,"Sped up my computer a little. easy to instal, went to crucial.com and did a scan to be sure it would work with my hp 210-1091nr"
4,a good product,"it s cheap product and very good ,,,, since i bought this ram memory my laptop work much better....i recommande this product"
4,"Good for the ""Quick Read"" genre","While this book may lack a thing or two in style and literary creativity, it still creates an admirable montage of events, centered around Rune, it's central character. Good to lose yourself in....Bad to look to for literary merit. Jeffery Deaver is not Ralph Ellison, quite obviously, but the storyline is great, with lots of surprises. Maybe I've been submerged in ""Invisible Man"" and ""The Scarlet Letter"" and ""The Bell Jar"" for too long, but, as my English teacher would say, this book qualifies as a ""smut"" book........but, a good smut book nonetheless."
4,The best of the non-Rhyme books,"I quite enjoyed this book. Although it wasn't as good as his Lincoln Rhyme series, it was still a little page-turner. Deaver has done very well, as the heroine of the story is one of the most unusual in any genres -- a homeless, semi-dysfunctional romantic who works in a video store and survives by squatting in an empty apartment. Her flights of fancy with fairy tales wear a bit thin in places but there is enough fun, suspense and action in the tale to make up for it.As always, the story twists and turns and no-one is who they seem. The ending feels slightly pat but probably explained by this being one of his early works. This book is great if you want to get inside his mind and compare how it has matured and changed since.Definitely worth a read -- and if you haven't already, go and read the Lincoln Rhyme series. It's up there with Michael Connelly in my opinion."
3,A Fluffier Deaver Mystery,"Manhattan Is My Beat is a quick mystery read with only a few classic Deaver twists. Realizing he wrote this back in 1988, Deaver had not yet evolved to such vicious violence as in The Coffin Dancer or The Devils Teardrop.It's a quirky little story with a quirky little female, Rune, in her 20's, purplish hair, a desire for love and fantasy. She begins her biggest adventure when a friendly old man who has rented the same movie from the store she works in, 18 times in a month, is found dead, by Rune. Was it all part of the movie? Was it an accident? Does 1 million dollars really exist from a bank robbery over 50 years ago? And who are these people shooting at her now? I liked the ending, although a bit trite--it left me smiling.A fun piece of mystery fluff."
3,Good but not great.,"Manhattan is my beat is one of the early novels by Jeffery Deaver, and at times you can see the reflection of the brillance that you find in his latest novels. However at times the book is a wee bit slow for my taste and in particular for a Deaver novel.Rune, the heroine in this novel is actually a great character and you will find her to be quite enjoyable. The main premise of a crime solved via an old movie is interesting and could have been better developed, but I feel Deaver just did an adequate job.I do recommend that you read this novel because it is an enjoyable read and it contains the trademark Deaver twists, but you shuld be forewarned that this book will not enthrall you like Bone Collector, Coffin Dancer, Empty Chair, Maiden's Grave, or Devil's Teardrop. It is good but not great."
3,"Not bad,the book had a nice atmosphere.","This plot is rather simple, but kept my interest.Deaver has produced better works.The greatest thing (to me) in the story line was the beautiful city setting,which sets the scence for crime and mystery.I found the main character (Rune) to be most annoying and unsuitable as a mystery solver. I thought Rune was a bit unrealistic as a character.Apart from that,it is not a bad read."
2,I can't remember why I bought this.,"Someone or something I read recommended this book to me over 10 years ago. I just now got around to reading it. I can't imagine why I thought it would be good. I reread the review here to see if it would jog my memory, but no luck. I can't recommend this book. The plot is very twisty, that's true. Other than that, the characters seem as multi-dimensional as comic book heroes and villains and the dialog is ridiculous. Yes, the book is set in downtown NYC in the late 80's, but I was a frequent visitor at that time and had friends there. No one acted or talked like the people in this book. It's more like the view of someone who was a middle-aged suburbanite at the time and read an article in the Times about the East Village scene - and did no further research. Nearly every line of dialog clanged against my ears completely out of tune."
4,Deaver Makes You See the World,"Jeffrey Deaver is often called the master of ticking time bomb suspense. While it is true of most of his works, the Rune books, starting with Manhattan is my beat lacks the ticking time bomb, but instead immerses the reader into the world seen through the vivid imagination of a young woman who sees things through fairy-tale glasses.Rune is an almost perfect portrait of an ENFP, who vividly lives in a world half real and half of possibilities, which would both attract me to her... though she'd drive me crazy at the same time. In this book, her quest is one half of justice for a kindly old man who kept renting the same videotape over and over again, and half on a quest for a mythical treasure of great worth. However, when the worlds of her fantasy and the worlds of reality crash, the result is a strange mixture of the two world that only a person like Rune could survive."
4,An odd & enjoyable novel,"The great thing about this book, an early entry from twistmaster Deaver, is its heroine. Rune is not the usual highly educated, all knowing experts that Deaver has made his name with, but instead a punkish, homeless girl who lives in her own fantasy version of Manhattan.She is the last person who should investigate a murder, but that is exactly what she does when an old man she has befriended is brutally murdered in what appears to be a professional hit. Armed with only her spunk and knowledge gleamed from her favourite Nior films, Rune sets out to bring the killers to justice, only to learn that in the real world, there are no ture happy endings.Highly entertaining tale is probably a little too whimsical for many hard-core thriller readers (fans of Deaver's clinical, cynical heroes will be shocked,) but the novel has atmosphere to burn, and the mystery keeps you hooked to the last page.An offbeat treat."
3,It's a fun cover album,"I think the reviewer from Harrisonburg, Virginia USA needs to get a sense of humor. This album, and all the ""Pickin' on"" albums are just fun covers of classic rock songs."
5,PERFECT BOOK FOR THOSE IN RECOVERY FROM ADDICTION,"NIV Recovery Devotional BibleI am very happy with my purchase. I didn't even know this book existed,but when somebody told me about it I was so pleased to find it on your site. The price was unbelieveable, and because it was a used book I wasn't sure what kind of condition it would be in, even though your comment on it was (very good) It should have said excellent condition, as there was no markings at all in it, even the presented to and from page was clean. This was the first purchase I've made from Amazon and I will always, when shopping for certain items check your site first. In fact, I'm looking through your products now for an anniversary present for my husband. Thank you so much for the great shopping experiance!!!!!!!!!Sincerely, Katrina Gifford"
4,Like new,"Item was in the original box and ornament like new.Seller was very prompt in sending order. Since it was right at Christmas, I did not expect the order until after the holidays. However, the order arrived a few days prior to Christmas Eve."
5,CHICANO WORLD PT.2,"THIS IS A GREAT CD. IF U LIKE CAPONE'S MUSIC THIS CD IS A MUST. THE BEST TRACKS ON THIS CD ARE, ""CAPS IS THE NAME"", ""SET IT OFF"", AND ""ONLY WHEN IM DRUNK""."
5,Thumbs up,"This book is very well written. If you like any of Aesop's Fables, you will probably like the individual tales. If you are interested in traditional Native American life, you will probably like the settings introducing and linking the tales. The best part is that Eastman grew up Souix and the authenticity shows."
5,best tmb guide,"We hiked the Tour de Mont Blanc (tmb) in August 2003 and used the previous edition of this book. A british couple shared this new edition with us and we could not wait to purchase one ourselves.This edition is up-to-date and provides excellent information about clockwise and the more traditional counterclockwise routes. Each leg is accurately described with a detailed map and elevation chart. Refuges are listed, giving the hiker information about number of available beds and phone numbers to call ahead for reservations."
4,Good Read,I enjoyed this book. It was moving. It can help someone to realize how relationships can be healed. I highly recommend this book.
3,Spend the extra money,It cost less than $20 and I got what I paid for. The picture is very grainy. But it is better than nothing..........
5,Solid work horse for the occasional headset use,After an exhaustive search for the perfect headset I found the one that really works. TheBoom V4 worked out of the box flawlessly - clear sound paired with an excellent passive noise cancellation mic. Only downside is that the wear comfort is only acceptable for the occasional use - if you use a headset frequently like me buy theBoom E.Following a couple of hours of using theBoom V4 I decided to upgrade to theBoom E which is the only in ear headset to date that I can comfortably wear for an entire work day. Most amazingly is the sound quality when driving in my convertible top down on the freeway - beats the build in bluetooth system in my BMW 335iC hands down...
3,what happened to the price????,"I don't own this but it's been on my wishlist for my 4yr. old for a while now, I can't help but notice that the price has doubled! $100. for kids cd player/radio? That's crazy, there is no way this item is worth $100.This can be found right here on Amazon, sold by Target for about $40.!"
3,Nothing Great,"Bought this for my 5 year old daughter. She is happy with it, and everything works fine so far, but it could use a few improvements. Starting up the CD player is pretty slow. It seems to take a very long time to start. Also, not very excited about the dial for sound. Would be so much better if it were digital like everything else so I could set it to a specific level. We use this for sleep music at night and sometimes it's to loud and sometimes it's to soft. So, for now, it works fine but I was hoping for more."
2,Cute but cheap and broke too fast,"In less than a year and with supervised use by a four year old and almost three year old, it broke. I don't get it. One second it plays the cd the next it doesn't. I do not recommend it. It's expensive for what it is and obviously cheaply made."
1,CD Player Stops Working,"This is the first review I have ever written, but I'm upset about the quality of this product. I have had this player for less than 6 months and already the CD player has stopped working. Sometimes it doesn't spin. Sometimes it just displays ""error"" when you turn the CD portion on. The company only has a 90 day warranty, so given that this has broken after that timeframe, it will cost me $25 + shipping to have them look at it. Almost the cost of a new one to send back their defective product. I have read numerous reviews indicating the same problem and can't believe nothing has been done to correct this issue. I already had a working unit similar to this but bought the Hello Kitty version because my daughter loves Hello Kitty. Apparently I should just attach stickers to my other one. I have other boom boxes that have lasted 10+ years. Less than 6 months shouldn't be acceptable."
1,You will be disappointed,"We bought this for our six year old for Christmas. It's a very cute player, however right out of the box, the CD player didn't work. The radio did work and so did the tape player, but we bought it mainly for the CD player.In reading the reviews, our experience seems typical. I think we will buy a different CD player to replace this piece of junk. (One that I have read the reviews on).FYI: Our 8 yr. old has owned the strawberry shortcake CD player for years and has not had any problems with it . . . ."
1,"Hello Kitty, not so great","I researched CD players for a couple months before deciding to buy the Hello Kitty Boom Box, due to the great reviews it received. Within 4 months the CD player stopped working. Nows its a expensive pretty pink AM/FM radio. We bought it for my granddaughter who lives in another state, so she could hear our voice, reading and singing to her recorded on CD's. The AM/FM radio were added options we didn't need. So at this point its worthless to us."
2,Poor Choice!,"The colors and Hello Kitty decal cause me to give this 2 stars...otherwise, I would give it none. The controls and technology seem very out dated (who needs a casette player today?,,,, and that is the easiest of the functions to use) The most used controls are difficult to get to: (CD player, Volume, Radio ) and labels on them are hard to read . Had I seen this in person I never would have bought it.. We purchased a boom box for my grandson five years ago that is far more convenient and that has been extremely durable. We bought another for the house that must be ten or more years old that works much more easily. Why make things so difficult for a 6 year old?"
4,No headphone jack!,"We bought this for our daughter's 4-year-old birthday present. She loves Hello Kitty and loves listening to her CDs on this machine. We also bought a pair of pink child's headphones because she loves pink and we love peace and quiet. Unfortunately, this boom box does not have a headphone jack. Had I known that, I would have selected another product. Still, our daughter is very pleased with this boom box and her parents are learning to tune out the kiddie music."
3,Hello Kitty CD Boombox,"This is a great-looking player that has difficulty playing home-made CDs despite the description - and regardless of the program used to make the CDs. The manual is not well written - there is no reference in the trouble-shooting guide to the issue of home-made CDs not playing. There is no reference in the guide to the function of the small switch on the back of the unit called the ""Beat Switch"" - flipping it from one side to the other made one home-made CD work but it had no effect on the ability of the others to play. These CDs of my daughter's play in all our other CD players - so essentially this unit is a TOY."
4,"Pretty design, and will grow with kids","I bought this as a gift for my two year olds who ask for music whenever they are going down for naps or bedtime. They have a collection of cassette tapes that they choose from and try to put in the slot. Some day they'll get it... They also are learning how to access the CD part but haven't figured out the pushing the button only once part. It should come with time.Easy on the eyes (if you like pink) and easy to use this boom capsule fits nicely on top of our kids dresser and has adequate volume range and fidelity for bedtime music.Cassette buttons take more force than can be generated by a two year old and until they can read, we have to run it. A good enhancement would be to use contrasting colors for the start and stop buttons for non-reading kids.However, I realize that this was probably not intended for operation by toddlers... although it could be."
3,Not that great,"It was a great gift and worth every cent, but it looks like it's a leftover from the 80's because of the cassette player, I'll have to explain my daugther what that was and I'm sure she'll wonder why her boom box has such thing."
1,For the Uninitiated,"The nature of the content is fine for the lay reader, but hardly worth the time and money for the serious. This is book is like reading the chinese ""zodiac"" found in chinese restaurants and coming away thinking like you have any insight at all into chinese cosmology theory. Clearly meant for the uninitiated western reader."
1,The book is a mish mosh,"It's too bad this book is a mish mosh and that neophytes in Chinese medicine are not going to know this. Some of the material is very standard and authentic, but a lot of it is the authors' own invention. So be careful with this. If you want the real deal, this is not the book you want. A better introduction to standard Chinese medicine is Kaptchuk's classic, The Web That Has No Weaver."
4,Good for the 5 Elements,I need to get some information about chinese medicine for massage school.This book is pretty good and it is easy to read.The main focus is on the 5 Elements. If you need to know more about it than this is your book.
3,Book review,"I was looking for more food information in this book regarding fertility. There was little. But, the book is very informative in regards to the body in whole."
1,Still haven't received book...,"I'd love to offer a review, but the book has never arrived. Should I order again? Will you credit my account? Please advise."
4,A Clear Presentation,"This is the most involved and lucid explanation of the Five Phases that I have found. I refer many of my patients to this book when they come for their initial session. It has numerous drawings, charts and graphs to support the written text. The Five Phase Theory, as presented in this book, can assist practicing acupunturists or students of Oriental Medicine in deepening their understanding of how to successfully handle the myriad problems and dis-eases presented by their patients. In my 25 years of practice I found extremely few books so well written and organized for everyday use and review."
5,Great HTML book!,"hi, I would like to say that this is an excellent book, it is very fun and interesting and of course it enables you to study HTML very very well! I highly recommend it!"
4,html at its best,when i picked this book i knew nothing about html coding. as i've finished this book its a whole new world 4 me. a great book to study even if u r a novice to html. highly recommended....
1,Reader,"This book does one thing, it shows that the author is an egotistical, self-serving feminist. It is poorly written and makes one wonder how truly over-exagerated is the reporting. Some of it is so implosible that it made me think that it must be fiction rather than a memoir. After reading over 100 pages of it I could take no more and put it away. I am sorry that I spent money on this type of trash. Don't spend yours."
5,Wife's Signature Perfume,"Just a note to let you know this is my wife's signature perfume, and the price is the best we have ever found. The bottles arrived about 3 days after purchase. Great service."
1,Order nightmare,"Ordered product on March 29. Was notified by e-mail that the item was on backorder, but would be sent as soon as their shipment arrived. On April 18, the money for this order was taken out of my account. As of today, May 14, I am still waiting for my purchase. I notified Samsonline and was informed that they too, could not track my order that was supposedly sent. They are trying to make my order good, but I am still waiting."
3,The next Maceo..........I think,"After listening to the CD, it doesn't do him justice at all. I had a chance to see him live in Raleigh,N.C. Believe me.....this is definitly the next funkiest sax player next to Maceo that I've heard. Since this is his first solo project, I really would like to hear him being backed by some top-notch players who'll light some fire underneath him cause he's got it but needs cats to showcase his style. Also more original songs would be great but I'm sure he knows that already. It was so great to see him doing a live show and the crowd was moving and groovin' to his soulful sound. I even told him after that show that he should have recorded the band he had that night cause when he was performing, all I could think of was Maceo. Does he have a website up? I am definitely looking forward to buying his future recordings and upcoming shows. 'Da boy is funky...funky...funky."
1,waste of money,"Have owned this printer for 1 year. Have had to return it to HP once for replacement. I can almost NEVER print an entire document without having to hand load the paper. After only days of owning this printer it began advancing as many pages as it wants. Now has begun giving a ""carriage jam"" error and this is uncorrectable for me. The only way I have found to fix it is to power the thing off, pray and then try to power it back on.I had a HP Laserjet 4L that I used without any problems for almost 6 years so I was pretty confident with this purchase. As soon as I select another printer this one is going right in the trash where it belongs!"
4,Therm O Web Medium Wheeled Tote,"I like the size, ease of pulling. I like the color and compartments. I can get a lot into it. It is hard to manage lifting it into car, but that's to be expected. However a snap broke on one side when I first looked at it. It's not important enough to send back."
5,The Worksheets Alone are worth the Price,"After reading ASTROLOGY ANYONE? I was gently seduced into the world of astrology. In the past, when I have looked at astrology books, I have been intimidated by dates and numbers. Not so here. Alyce Renee explains with utter clarity the mysteries of astrology and provides worksheets for the reader to make his own astrological chart. Thankyou, Alyce Renee."
5,Mad Men maintains its place as the best American show on TV,"With season 3 of Mad Men, Matthew Weiner pushes creative boundaries by incorporating elements of film noir, Sirkian melodrama, and even black comedy to the mix. Jon Hamm's acting chops are also pushed to higher levels as Don Draper's positions as powerful ad man and husband are increasingly threatened by the progressive changes of the decade. In sum, it's a profound and character-driven affair that yields new delights with every viewing. And Weiner's commentary tracks are, as usual, top-notch.While I do admit to preferring season 2's individual storylines over the ones in season 3, it makes no difference in my rating because Mad Men continues to operate on a higher level than everything else that's being produced right now in America, be it TV show or movie."
4,"Betty, the TRUE Desperate Housewife","While I love January Jones, this Betty is a TRUE desperate, miserable housewife. I find it hard to believe that a woman of her means in the 60's could be soooooo miserable. She is a SPOILED BRAT, and like watching a train wreck, you can't help but keep watching."
1,lattedeb,"I purchased season 1-4 of Mad Men for Blu-ray, which we have. Season 1 had 1 incompatable disk, Season 2 had all 3 disks incompatable, Season 3 had all good disks, and Season 4 had 1 incompatable disk. Purchased for a gift for my husband. We really enjoyed the first 2 disks on season 1 and are very disappointed that we can't continue watching in sequence. After finding our first bad disk we opened them all and tried them and are so, so disappointed in the outcome. First time ordering DVDs from Amazon & will not do so again!"
2,Boring... waste of time,Wow... I can't believe I am saying this.. I am a big fan of this series... but the 3rd season.. BORING.Feel like I wasted my $20 and I am not sure I even want to finish the unwatched shows.Just my .02Yawn.
3,"Good, but not as good as season 1&2","I love the show. I missed season 1 and started watching half of season 2. So I had to buy the season 1 & 2 on DVD to see all the shows. Seeing season 3 on TV, I can say it's not as good as season 1 & 2. I'm not going to pre-order season 3 on DVD, I'll wait a few months for it to go on sale. But, I will add season 3 to my MadMen collection."
2,"Less Don, more periferals","This third series abandons the slow and intoxicating pace of the previous seasons. Scenes are shorter, dialogues are faster and there's less room for real acting. Instead, the viewer get's to see more of the outside world and the secondary characters. The story revolves no longer around Don, as he often seems to play an extra instead of a main character."
2,Bad cds,"We enjoy watching the series. This commentary is not on the show, but on the quality of the cds sent. We have purchased seasons 1-3. In each season there has been a disk that has skips in it. We purchase a lot of movies from amazon, these disks are not of the quality we are used to purchasing from you."
5,Mad over Mad Men,"I loved Season Three, can't wait for Season Four comes out, I love the business theme, and the individual stories of the creators. I love the nostology the show presents, seeing the little girl in those baby doll pajamas took me back what a joy to see that style again."
5,Mad Men is great,I never thought I would like this show due to lthe name . Can't quit watching. Was really drawn into the era.
5,Excellent,I continue to enjoy every season of this series. It has been produced well and I can't wait for the next season.
5,Mad Men,"Mad Men is captivating entertainment. An excellent cast makes for compelling drama. Although slightly before my time, I recognize and appreciate the revisiting of the 1960s. Although many of the characters are flawed and this can be discouraging, every now and then the writer's throw a bone to the viewer with some redeeming behavior in each character. Don Draper is irresistible, but at times I wish his wife would clean his clock."
5,Excellent show,"I cannot get enough of this show. Like any show, they have not so thrilling episodes, but as a whole it is an excellent show and I recommend everyone to check it out.The product is great, packaging looks great, and the DVD extras are great. I love going back and listening to the actor commentaries. I just wish there were more, but that is only because I am obsessed."
5,Keeps you up and up,"There has not been a single disappointment or slowness in any shape of form, so far. This TV series is by far the best TV drama in terms of writings, story line, casting and originality. It is so true and real as you feel you are living in 60's America. Characters, cultures, their life and ups and downs are so real and truly well done. I hope I see this TV series to come up in many coming years."
4,Fascinating Viewing,"Don finds himself at the top of his game, winning more in the advertising arena & enjoying life less as the payoff list for his deceit widens. Once again, superb writing by Weiner & company make for top-notch drama.Do you suppose Matt & the gang can write in one admirable adult character in this cast of despicables for this summer's season?"
5,Madmen Series 3,Madmen keeps getting better. In series 3 the characters are developed more and situtions teased out. Historically fascinating and personally intriuging. Impeccable art direction make the show gorgeous to look at. it's addictive viewing! Love it!
3,A big step down from Season 1 and 2,"A hard call between 2 and 3 stars. Production value/costumes save it. Other than that, the writers have run out of ideas and are depending on cliches. What's worse, the cliches are 2009 sensationalism superimposed on 1964. Ouch! Season 3 was just one shocking vignette strung to another. In relation to the great Season 1 and 2, it was painful to watch. This show will fall under the weight of its own premise--that the 1950s and early 60s were hedonistic times covered in a veneer of civility. They've brought the hedonism so far forward that the veneer of civility is completely missing, thus making the show feel like 2009 dressed up in 1960s costuming. If the writers can't find a new perspective in Season 4, then they've said what they have to say, and they should gracefully end the series. Season 1 and 2 were a great show."
4,Gripping,"Season 3 of Mad Men gets you further involved in the lives of these fasinating characters, set in a gripping period of History for America!"
2,Amazon Order Arrived with Postage Due,I have to learn that I always have trouble when I order from Amazon....this time the package arrived with postage due.
5,Hooked on MADMEN,My husband & I love this series. We were a little late in jumping on the bandwagon. We didn't watch the first season until the 2nd season was almost over. We played a lot of catch up & we're glad we did. It is so true to its time and profession (my husband is in advertising).
4,Yes Yes Yes,"Drinking, debauchery, and Donald Draper.... what more do you need to know? This show is everything!! If you've never seen it, please start from season 1 and begin. It starts slow but once you make it through, you'll be hooked."
5,Superior Series,"This dark drama series is television at it's best. Being a baby boomer, this series appeals to my memories of the sixties. I often comment to my husband that a certain article was in our home. The fashions and sets are authentic representations of that era. Also, the acting is top notch by all the characters."
5,Mad Men Season 3 - great!,"We ordered MadMen before Season 4 started so we were refreshed and ready to go! The episodes were great, especially the last one. What is particularly interesting about re-viewing the previous year, is that you can see nuances in the characters and specifics in scenes that were missed on the first viewing."
4,Solid adult entertainment,"Season 3 starts off a bit shaky. The first 6 episodes are more like short stories, without necessarily being linked to each other. But the over-arching theme of Season 3 can be likened to the fall of Rome. These men who are currently at the top of the world do not know the major changes that will affect them. For men like Don Draper & Roger Sterling, issues like the Civil Rights movement and the Vietnam War are on the periphery of their lives. But, the viewer is shown that the domestic lives, as well as the life of the country, are thrown for a loop.While much of the emphasis on Season 3 is on Don Draper, we do see major changes in the characters of Pete Campbell, Peggy Olsen, Joan Halloway, & Roger Sterling. Bert Cooper, who is usually shown as an eccentric old man, gets to display a killer instinct at unsuspecting times.Season 3 shakes the viewer out of comfortable expectations, and definitely lends an air of excitement in waiting for Season 4."
3,Mad Men Season 3,Love this series. Totally addicted to Mad Men. But the 3rd DVD of this set must have been scratched because it froze up in two different places and I missed some major parts of the story line.
5,Best season yet,"You must watch from the beginning of the series, but Season 3 is amazing. You will not be disappointed. I've always been sad that there are only 13 episodes in a season, but the quality is so extraordinary, I cherish these 13 over lesser 22-episode seasons.If you're not into Mad Men yet, start with Season 1. But don't stop until you get through Season 3 (at least)."
5,Mad Men,Purchased all seasons for my husband.He watches the DVDs again and again.He really enjoys the show.Great gift for anyone
4,Mad Men and Women - Always Entertaining,"Getting tired of Draper's complete disregard to his marriage and the rate at which he and Mrs. Draper go from being a stable couple to being absolutely psycho with eachother. So often the story jumps forward to scenes that force us to make up what happens in between. Criticisms out of the way, I find this series very entertaining, the characters are well developed and the period is completely captured."
4,Good soap opera. John Hamm acting superb,This is a Good soap opera. John Hamm acting superb. Mid-season a bit wandering. Continues to be excellent in terms of details of the period as well as the pace of shows of the time.
4,"Very well done series, loses a star for its ugly portrayal of alcoholism and abusive sexuality","Mad Men is a very well-polished series, but few of the characters have any heroic qualities, they are all pretty amoral and scummy.However, having said that, the DVDs in the series are very good, and the commentaries for at least two or three episodes on every disk are a great feature. The comments by the writers, directors, and actors are all very revealing into the vision and mindset of the creative team.I would really like to see some characters who aren't so deeply flawed, however. Such a universal lack of good judgment and good life choices is just sad and morose. Real life has nicer people, at least I want to believe that."
4,Building to a crescendo...,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LITH76/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgMad Men 3 starts off slow...makes you wonder where it's going but in the middle of the series it blows apart going into 42 different directions -- doing what it does best blowing your mind visually and emotionally as all the people you know show a different visage, a different personality, a different desire. The building to that chord is one that makes you not care one whit where the show is going because while it is unreal, it's a very real reflection of that time. And that makes this show a true marvel."
5,Fantastic series,Buy all 3 seasons and you'll be ready for Season 4!! Great look at the early 60's in America. Wonderful actors; great characters; funny & engaging plots. A must see~
5,Great Paring Knife,Chicago Cutlery Metropolitan 3-1/2-Inch Paring KnifeThis paring knife is comfortable for my arthritic hand and it is easy to keep sharpened. I keep several of them in my knife block along with some expensive longer knives...but I only use this brand paring knife.
4,Very Nice But Not The Original,A very nice Made in China knock-off of the original 102S out of production Chicago Cutlery knife. A great little gift item or addition to your own kitchen.Not quite as sharp or as well-made as the original. Only very knowledgeable would be able to tell the difference as there is no country of origin on this knife or on the original.Made even better by 4 for 3 special offer.
4,This is a great little knife,"It's nothing fancy...just a sharpened blade in a walnut handle. The blade, though, is sharp, well shaped and the knife is very easy to hold and use.Incidentally, this knife seems to have attracted quite a following...used samples of the older version, stamped ""102S"" on the handle, sell consistently on eBay for more than this one does when new."
3,quality control,"Same great knife, except the handle's squared off corners are too pointly. It's poked my hand a few times. While not actually painful, it's unpleasant."
3,Ok Knife,"I had purchased one of these about a year or two ago and it was a very nice knife. It somehow got ""lost"" in my kitchen so I ordered another one. This one is not nearly as sharp as my last. Just OK."
5,"Excellent product, timeless design","We received a set of Chicago Cutlery as a wedding gift - 28 years ago. (We were 20, had no furniture, and this was very very cool for us at the time - very fancy!)Fast-forward 28 years, multiple moves, two boys. The Chicago Cutlery is still hanging in there, still looks great, still holds an edge. We had to replace a couple over the years (mostly due to kiddos and ""prying things"" with the tips.)This was a replacement. Looked/felt/cut just like the original, and matched all its peers in the drawer.Thank you Chicago Cutlery! Great long-lived tools that have done many tasks over the years.JDMc"
2,My husband doesn't like it,"For a man with little rhythm, this book can be a bit challenging and boring. For mothers who love dancing, buy a book about you and your baby dancing. Leave daddy out of it."
2,Boring.,"This book is boring, plain and simple. Even when dancing with my little one while reading the book, he was still bored."
5,Mama likes what baby likes,"This isn't my favorite children's book, but my 1 year old loves it. I must have read this book at least 40 times today at his request. I have it memorized. I'm not sure what it is, but he can't get enough. This is the first book he's shown a preference for, so I would certainly buy it again."
3,She likes it,My 15 month old likes this book b/c of the melody and singing but it's a little too basic for her. She prefers her books with more of a plot.
5,OMKARA------SHAKESPEARE DONE MODERN STYLE IN INDIA,"THIS IS A HINDI SUBTITLED VERSION OF OTHELLO AND A GREAT JOB WAS DONE BY SAIF ALI KHAN, AJAY DEVGAN, AND KAREENA KAPOOR, (Bips does an extended cameo and dance number). IT TAKES PLACE IN MODERN TIMES VIA A POLITICAL SETTING IN A SMALL VILLAGE.Watch and enjoy Ajay Devgan's Othello and Saif Ali Khan basically stealing the show as Langda his Right hand man. There is an excellent breakdown of the characters and their individual parts on WIKIPEDIA. I highly recommend it. It's my understanding by reviews that it did poorly box office wise because of the supposed foul language. I'm pretty lenient if it's in context and by western standards it was pretty tame stuff in the range of a pg13 rating . Not for the strict folks or those with small kids in the room. Othello's content was always meant for adults anyway. Excellent acting . Bravo to all."
5,Amazing & Spellbinding,"Vishal Bharadwaj is a great storyteller and an amazing Music Director as well. This is one of my Favorite movies of all time and I listen to the Soundtrack almost daily. The Othello story is one of Shakespeare's greatest and Bharadwaj does an amazing job translating it into modern, provincial India.The acting is all stellar, with Ajay Devgan, Vivek Oberoi, and Kareena Kappor being standouts. As others have said this is much more than a Shakespeare retelling, and much more than a gangster movie, and yet it is also great on those levels as well."
4,Nelles South China Map,"Southern China Nelles Map (Nelles Maps)Standard paper map concertina folding, not yet field tested for durability. Good colours and relief shading, detail of roads, rail, rivers and villages well balanced given the scale (1:1,750,000). Major tourist features identified. The biggest fault with this map is it has no Chinese characters, or Pinyin tone accents."
3,"Nice plate, but undersized.","I returned this plate because I wanted a true 10-inch pie plate, and this one is really a deep 9-inch size, not 10-inch like the description says. They also measured the depth from the outside, so it is actually 1-1/2 inches on the inside."
5,Adorable and Comfortable,"I've always liked the Ugh style boot and have wanted to get a pair like them for my four year old daughter (altough not at the Ugh price). When I purchased these boots they were about $20, which I thought was a very reasonable price. I also liked the studded bear accent on the boot which is important for my daughter who refuses to where anything unless is is embellished in some way. Although she has just begun to wear them, she wants to wear them constantly (even in 80 degree whether), but so far so good. Comfort is a major issue for her and at this point she will only wear two pairs of shoes that she has (these being one of the two). Time will tell how they hold up when the weather gets worse, but she loves them, and they seem very well made, and definately comfortable with the faux fur lining."
5,A really cute movie,"This movie continues where the first one left off. Now the newly married daughter and her mother are both pregnant. It is very funny. The characters are very lovable and funny. A great family movie. Probably more for those with teenage girls than younger children or teenage boys. Or of course it is great to watch with your adult children too. I really liked it. Probably not as good as ""Father of the Bride"" but almost as good."
3,Similar Formula to Original With Some Success,"Father of the Bride was a classic comedy. So one knew that a sequel had to be on the way. The original cast of Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, Kimberly Williams, and Martin Short are back and in fine form.Whereas there are some comical moments, it just seems like the pacing of the film is oh so identical to the original. Just as Mrs Banks announces her pregancy, Franc is on the scene to plan another baby shower. And a double one at that to honor Kimberly William's character. The scenes just become to off the wall an the repetitive false alarms add very little to the story.Nonetheless, Steve Martin and Martin Short are very entertaining. The wrecking ball scene with Mr. Habib is priceless. Not quite the original but Father of the Bride 2 certainly rates as amusing."
5,Sweet Movie!,Father Of The Bride Part II was a wonderful sweet and charming movie that I liked better than the first movie which was also a very good movie that was sweet and charming but for some reason this sequel just appealed to me more maybe because I saw it before I saw Father of the Bride but anyway both are cute and enjoyable and I could watch them again.
1,"Disney finally tries a ""special feature"" DVD, but flubs","This is one of my favorite movies. I have been waiting more than a year for it to come out on DVD. Since it is a Disney movie, I didn't expect much from the DVD as they are notoriously stingy with their discs -- demanding the top prices with the fewest features. I did, however, actually expect for it to play on my DVD player. Boy, was I wrong! I ordered a disc and low and behold the extremely long previews and FBI warnings were the only things that would play -- no MOVIE! I send it back and get another copy. SAME THING HAPPENS. Since Disney can't seem to score with ""special features"" that will actually work, perhaps they should consider lowering their prices to be more competitive and continue offering ""featureless"" discs.I was so looking forward to the audio commentary of Steve Martin and Martin Short. I guess I'll just have to watch my old VHS and imagine what they would have said at each part! Shame on you Disney...."
5,Just as nice as the first,"This movie along with it's predessor have to be two of the nicest and funniest movies of all time. If you just want to be put into a good mmod watch this movie. The best thing about this movie and it's predesscor is the fact that there is no social commentary, no underlying theme. Just a funny movie about family life."
5,comment on Subflower Splendor,"This is the very best anthology of Chinese poetry, including some of t best poetry in the world. The original texts should be compared with the translations"
1,There's no comparison...,"She has got to be the worse singer in modern history.To think she has to audacity to consider herself a diva.What cave did she crawl from? Please send her back!!!!I've heard better voices from a Tasmanian she devil. With the likes of her we are on the verge of a music dark-age.Please, Please do not compare her to Billy Holiday."
2,Disappointed,It was just OK even though I love her voice. The music was so so and I wouldn't recommend it
3,Not bad but I liked her first CD better and her newest Cd the best!,"I enjoyed this CD but I expected more. I have her first CD and this one is basicaly a remake of that with maybe 3 new songs that are just Ok. I would really recommend Macy Gray's newest CD ""BIG"" it is very good. I would rate it a 5. Every song is different and she has some that are my favorites ( Finally Made me Happy, Shoo Be Doo, Strange Behavior, One For Me). You would listen to this CD over and over. She adds humor(as she always does) to some of her songs such as ""Strange Behavior"". Do check out her ""BIG"" CD!"
1,One Of The Worse Singers To Ever Get A Record Deal,Macy Gray sounds like Donald Duck with a hangover. Her voice is awful. I don't even know who's worse: Macy or Shakira. Macy needs to stop singing and stick to playing crazy woman roles on TV.
1,the female bob dylan has a best of .....?!?!?!?!?!?,"this would make a terrific torturing device.and if the POW is deaf,just show him/her the cover !!!!!"
5,Love these cards,"T. Harv Eker, is the man!! I love these cards, I carry them in my purse, they are so motivating and always keep me connected to my purpose and keep me focused on the Big Picture of life and what I want. You can pick up just even one card a day and be inspired. I recommend picking the top 6 and reviewing at least those 6 everyday. The value is great too, $11.00 is a steal!!"
5,changing your mind blue print,"Our group of 9 ladies have been doing a rconditioning of the mind with the book and the cards are just a small reminder that keeps us on track. I love them, Kitty Tessin"
2,Nice cards with affirmations,I think the cards are quality material and they will last a while but they aren't quite what I was expecting for the price. I got more from the book on tape. Excellent book!
4,A Bible you can read!,"Bought as a lecturn Bible for a congregation that includes some elderly and sight impaired, the New RSV Giant Print 4 Volume Bible has turned out to be an excellent choice which will greatly facilitate worship. If anything the print is too big, but considering the diminutive print size of regular Pew and even supposedly large print Bibles this is a welcome change. The translation is also to be recommended, accurate to the original languages yet free flowing and easy to read."
5,NRSV Giant Print (Burgundy 4-Volume Set),"This is a good translation and an excellent Bible. The 18-point font, in combination with a single column format, creates perfect readability. I own both the NIV and NRSV 4-volume sets. These are wonderful. It would be great if Nelson offered this for the NKJV."
3,The return of the passenger pigeon,"Edward Starke, a wealthy man, dreams of seeing the sky filled with now-extinct passenger pigeons once again. He offers a $100,000 reward to anyone who can present to him a living male and female of the species. Someone in Florida claims to have found what he's looking for and gets the reward. But tragedy sets in, not only to the people involved in this enterprise, but to the two pigeons as well: they die in a fire. There is just not enough going on here to sustain our interest; the conflict is very weak. A minor work for Kantor."
2,None detailed Megatron,"Megatron has to be one of the worst detailed transformers I have every seen. There are only 3 colors on his whole body, blue, gray-silver, and the clear red plastic. His head does not even light up like it does on the box. Also, if you look at the back of the box, the button for the lights and sound is in a different place. I know that none of the other movie transformers look like what is on the back of the box 100%, but megatron is not even close. I have all the movie transformers and this one is just horrible."
2,Not for kids,"This is VERY hard to put together! Also, it doesn't want to ""stay"" together once transformed... not worth the money!!!"
5,Excellent choice!,Got this for Christmas from hubby. Very neat and easy to find each spice. Heavy enough wont tip over. Love it!
5,Love it.,"Not cheap stainless material, very heavy. They gave the common spice name tags. I found almost all of them. The left you can write by yourself."
4,Choose your own spices,"I like this spice rack because it was the only contemporary-looking one I could find that let me fill my own spice jars with my own spices. Comes with labels for all the common spices you can think of - just choose the 12 you use all the time that you'd like to have on your countertop. Also comes with blank labels. It looks really nice on my countertop and takes up hardly any room. One downside - it's really dry in my place and some stickers didn't stick, so I just glued 'em."
5,Love it!,"This is a very attractive, modern, clean-looking spice rack that I use regularly in my kitchen and it looks great against my wall."
4,beautiful,"Nice present, she loved it and will probably use it forever.A little pricey (if you include the cost of spices, which I did)."
4,Convienent,"I really like that this can hang on the wall. I have limited room and try to get as much vertical space as possible, this did the trick. Look good too"
5,Very durable,I bought this for our RV because we have some narrow shelves that not much else would fit. I was surprised at how heavy this was. My only issue is that I one broken glass bottle for the spices but I don't think you would be disappointed if you were considering this item.
5,Works Great,I put this on the wall right in front of the prep table where I make meals. It is great having them right at your fingertips.
4,Very Nice!,"I've had this for a few month now and it's really very nice looking in my newly renovated kitchen! I have it sitting on my counter because I hesitate to poke holes in the wall for now. It comes with most of the spices I use regularly, I still have some other spices that I keep in the fridge (paprika for instance). The white caps that you put on to sprinkle the spice does not fit perfectly because the grooves in the bottle top come up to high to the rim. That said, I haven't had one fall off yet. I would consider buying another set if I needed one."
4,Pycnogenol,"Anyone who may be suffering from acne, this seems to very beneficial in helping.Makes skin smoother and healthier looking. No bad side effects noted."
1,Horrible nausea & ulcer-like stomach pain!,"Had to stop taking it. Taking w/food didn't help either! I felt like my stomach was bleeding, the pain was so bad!"
3,Now Pycnogenol,"I have been using these for a week after reading a study about it but so far all they've done is make me sleepy, I don't know if it's because they have bioflavonoids in them. I have been taking the dose they took in the study, 150 mg in divided doses. Hopefully with time I will feel a difference."
5,A Family Treasure!,"I bought this book nearly eleven years ago when my first child was a toddler and have used it for every holiday ever since! Through this book we have learned so much about the history of holidays, as well as recipes, crafts, and activities. Even more importantly the author has helped our own family develop holiday traditions that are both fun and meaningful, even for that toddler turned teenager! Holiday traditions are comforting and bring families closer together, and this book is a tremendous help if you are looking for inspiration. After eleven years I still can sit down to look up a certain holiday and find myself still reading an hour later! It is definitely one of the most treasured books in my collection!"
4,Really wonderful book !,I AM A FAN OF THIS AUTHOR AND THIS BOOK IS WONDERFUL!!!!!! IT IS VERY INTERESTING AND FUN TO LOOK UP IDEAS EACH MONTH. THIS IS NICE TO PASS ON IN A FAMILY FOR CREATING TRADITIONS.
2,"Okay, but definitely nothing special","This book is okay, but nowhere near as good as the author's earlier works. Although initially intrigued by the ""legends"", those I checked looked stupid to me ... e.g., about how a pansy's petals tell the story of how a wicked queen mistreats her stepdaughters, with no positive (much less fairytale) ending, nothing remotely uplifting, no moral, etc. DEFINITELY not the type of thing you'd print to give with a pressed flower pansy, or other form of the flower. The recipes are equally impractical, since few people use suet in desserts these days.And all the stories in the voice of the mythical Mrs. Sharp just seemed stupid and contrived. Although the premise was excellent, the book just didn't follow through."
5,Ackroyd is actually funny in this.,"I can usually bank on John Cusack - ""The Grifters"", ""The Sure Thing"", ""Say Anything"", ""High Fidelity"", ""Being John Malkovitch"" - try to forget about ""Pushing Tin"" and some others. The same is true about Jeremy Piven (see him as the cashier in ""Singles""). I was concerned, however, about Dan Ackroyd. He was actually very funny in this as the Grocer. Buy this movie."
4,A smart black comedy.,"This was a film I watched at 2am half asleep, I can say it woke me up though. This is a really enjoyable film,the script is witty, and the plot is an interesting one. A man called Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a hitman who is called to a 10 year school reunion at Grosse Pointe, which happens to coincide with an assigment for him. When Martin arrives he visits his old girlfriend (Minnie Driver) who he stood up on the prom night, for this he has some explaining to do. On top of this he has a rival trying to do his job and another one trying to kill him. The script ( co-written by Cusack) is darkly witty and the performances by Minnie and Cusack are very well delivered (I reckon they were the best part of the movie).Really I would give it 4 1/2 stars because it was very enjoyable.It was a bit silly in one or two areas, which is a shme because I really enjoyd this film. I suggest you watch it when you can."
5,John and Joan Cusack how could you go wrong,This movie is so funny and quirky. Love the whole lone wolf hitman idea and him falling in love again with Minnie Driver.
1,Picture quality is Rubbish,I wholeheartedly agree with the majority of the reviews posted here... This is a g-r-e-a-t movie. But I absolutely will not buy a copy until a version with a quality transfer is made available.
5,Grosse Pointe Blank,"One of my all time favorite movies. A dark comedy with a love story. Yes and thank you! Everything about this movie is spot on: cast, acting, story, writing, execution...."
5,Grosse Point Blank,"I loved this movie! The casting of Grosse Point Blank could not have been better. very funny. The subject, a hit man attending his high school reunion, and re-discovering his high school swetheart may sound un-workable but it does. If you have not seen this movie I recommend it to everyone. John"
4,Hitmen With A Soft side,"Another great movie with John Cusack in it. It's a romantic comedy of a guy who is a hitman, and ends up back in the town he went to highschool. There he finds his ex-girlfriend played by Minnie Driver. There is also the highschool reunion on and he has to find time to see his ex as well as do a hit. Great comedy and great music, this should be in any dvd collection. Witty dialouge with a small giggle here and there. Something to watch when there is nothing on Tv."
5,"A Unique, Clever and Fun Film","John Cusack is great in this film playing a contract killer in the midst of industry conflict (secondary to the formation of a union for contract killers spearheaded by Dan Akroyd) who goes back to his 10th high school reunion. This movie is funny, exciting and clever. Alan Arkin is wonderful as Cusack's reluctant therapist. The soundtrack is great also (especially for anyone who was in High School in the early 1980's)and fits with the movie's energy level. Jeremy Piven (as the old best friend, naturally) and Minnie Driver are very good in this film also. This is definitely a movie worth owning."
5,John Cusack's Best,"I first saw this during it's initial VHS release. The story is of Martin Blank, a professional Los Angeles hit man who is drawn back to his rural hometown to both attend his high school reunion and take on a contract to whack a guy.One of the most well-written scripts of the 90's, in my opinion, doesn't work without John Cusack being cast as Martin Blank. He sold the role perfectly, and shines throughout the film, alongside a witty, phenomenal supporting cast of Minnie Driver, Jeremy Piven, Dan Akroyd and Joan Cusack.Often mistaken as completely morbid, the film takes on not only a tone of humor, but that of vengance and morality. You must see this film.The DVD, on the other end, [stinks]. Yet another incredible film thrown out there on DVD with a poor transfer and a trailer for an extra. The film sounds fanastic though, and scenes such as the Akroyd/Cusack gunfight and the destruction of the mini-mart can be greatly enjoyed with a good surround sound setup."
5,Grosse Pointe Blank,"Sharp wit combined with excellent delivery make Grosse Pointe one of my favorite movies. It's always interesting when the protagonist is such an aweful person, yet seems like a hero. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes dry humor and has a tolerance for the depths of human monstrosity."
5,The best film of the nineties,"Someone explain how ""Titanic"" got eleven Oscars in the same year ""Grosse Pointe Blank"" came out? There's something seriously wrong with anyone who doesn't love this movie to bits. It has comedy, action, romance, and everything is first-rate. Buy this, then buy the soundtrack, and then write a review like this giving it 5 stars. It worked for me."
5,The most amazing film of my life,"Using a pseudo Hamlet plot we explore the pyche of an assassin who, through rediscovering his love for life, loses the taste for killing. Excellent film, not a line or shot it wasted, everything has meaning."
5,PERFECT,"If there was a movie (becides ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and the ""Evil Dead"" flicks) that kept me from getting bored during some part of it, it would have to be this one. The script and actors made for a very entertaining movie. Cusak and his co-writers made it possible. Also adding Benny ""The Jet"" was awsome. Never thought that I would see John Cusak in a fight seen with a Jackie Chan great such as Benny ""The Jet"". Anyway, I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a fresh new idea."
5,GENIUS!!!,"I saw this movie on a Tuesday and then every day for the next week. It was more than witty, more than funny and more than brilliant! It's been a long time since we have seen anything fabulously original from Hollywood. John Cusack has confirmed my long held belief - he is a genius! We need more movies like this! Excellent in every way and only capable of getting better with every viewing. I should know, I've seen it more times than I care to reveal!"
5,Hilarious dark comedy,"For some strange reason, this very entertaining and enjoyable film slipped under the radar and did not receive the praise it deserves.It is a delightful dark comedy that has inspired numerous short stories and other films. The music and photography in the film areterrific, and the acting absolutely delightful and memorable. For anyone who likes snappy dialogue, good acting, and humorous moments,this film is a must see."
1,Grosse Point Blank,I was very unhappy with Movie Mars which is where the DVD came from. The DVD was not made for my area but it didn't say that anywhere on the order. They did let me send it back but I had to pay the postage both ways. I doubt that I will use Amazon again to order.
3,Is it Blu or DVD?,"A great film, but Blu-ray picture quality is well below what you would expect for a 15 year old film. Very shoddy work by Disney, only looks slightly better than a DVD.Five stars for the film, one star for Disney's awful transfer to blu-ray."
3,Not Clearly marked WIDE SCREEN,As you can see by the picture of the product it doesn't clearly say Widescreen. somewhere in the print in the descriptions on the page wide screen was slipped in and when I received my DVD VERY CLEARLY on the front of the DVD Case is printed WIDE SCREEN in Huge letters. Unfortunately I didn't want wide screen as I can't stand watching DVD's that are enveloped but that is what I got. So Be VERY Very CAREFUL to make sure you get what you want. Other than that all I can say is that it came to me in pristine contition.
5,"Witty, Wacky, Wonderful","I LOVE this movie! This is by far one of the wittiest, funniest, smartest movies John and Joan Cusack have done. I laugh every time I watch it. I think most people can identify with the situations the film proposes. One of the best attributes of this film is that it offers us the chance to laugh at ourselves, (hello High School Reunions!). Despite the bad rap of violence in general these days, this movie contains comedic violence at its finest. As a fairly conservative female, I get to live vicariously through these dysfunctional characters and I love it! If you haven't seen it, DON'T DELAY, get it today!"
2,Mediocre,"I'm simply amazed at the reviews this film has received so far; nearly 5 stars??? You gotta be kidding!The movie, a black comedy, brings to the screen the story of a hit man who never got over his high school sweetheart and who returns home after many years to carry out... a hit. It is there that he bumps into his ""ex"" and the rest can be seen on screen.The acting is surprisingly (!) average, the dialogues below average, while the plot is just bearable.In short:John Cusack's character was really not the great.Minnie Driver was unexpectedly plain and bland.Dan Aykroyd was given terrible lines and a weak character to play.Joan Cusack's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on.Though the potential for a decent movie was there it fails to take off. A shame really... No masterpiece here."
2,Overrated,"Am I the ONLY one who found this movie to be ""Grosse""-ly overrated? And I am a huge, huge, HUGE Cusack fan. I really can't say I was impressed (the fact that Minnie Driver was in it didn't help matters any)nor did I find it to be overly funny. Definitely not Cusack's best."
1,Bobble head buck broken,"Delivery was prompt. Gave as a gift to a friend, but was broken when he opened it. The counter balance weight inside was rattling around and the head of the buck didn't bobble. Called the phone number on the invoice and spoke to a woman who had a bit of an attitude. She informed me that it was late in the year and that they were out of stock and were doing inventory at the time. She said because of similar problems to what I encountered, they weren't sure if they were going to order any more. She did offer a refund if I shipped it back. My friend who I gave the gift to decided to keep it because it would at least look good in his new house, even though it wouldn't have the action. Over all, product not so great; service was so so."
1,bobble buck review,"product was broken upon arrival, more of a hassle to return than worth the time or money"
5,MUST HAVE FOR HUNTERS,THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ALL HUNTERS . STICK IT ON YOUR DASH AND YOUR IN THE HUNT ALL YEAR LONG.
1,Not Larry Bishop's Hell Ride,I ordered this DVD and when it arrived it was not Larry Bishop's Hell Ride. It was directed by Mark C. (can't remember his last name) and had a no-name cast. I returned it to Amazon.
4,great lights but mounting...,"mounting these lights are a little challenging but with a little persuasion, they will mount fine. great for offroading and lighting up the road with a little snow on the ground."
1,You get what you pay for,"It was free, so I downloaded it. You get what you pay for. The formatting is awful. Whoever formatted this needs to remember that poetry needs to be formatted as poetry, or it is just prose with some capital letters thrown in. This edition reads like a novel, not as a collection of poems. Find another edition and pay the buck or two for it -- it will be worth it. Now I need to figure out how to get this stinker off my Kindle download list... If I could give this no stars, I would, but I have to give it something."
1,No line breaks,"Line breaks don't show up--successive lines run together, which is bad formatting in general and absolutely unacceptable for poetry. The formatting needs to be fixed."
2,formatting = no stars,"The formatting of this is horrible. Amazon says it was formatted to read on the PC as well as the Dx, it's completely untrue because the format is the same on my Kindle as it is on my PC. The document is filled with XXIVII, XI, XL, etc. as it's ""formatting."" It's not worth the download, even if it's free."
3,keyboard/mouse/speaker combo,"Bought this to complete a computer I built for sale; the price attracted me, but I was disappointed mostly in the speakers which have hardly any volume to speak of; the keyboard is cheap feeling, the mouse is actually an optical mouse that works fine. If I had seen this in a store, I would have passed on it."
3,E303 Dual Suspension Mountain Bike,"for $300 I expected more than Walmart bike. You get what you pay for. Bike was assembled in 30 minutes by myself, nothing too hard if you have all tools needed. Derailleurs will need bike tech adjustements, setting screws were too short in my case. Front shock looks cheap and feels cheap, but still does the work. After about 50 miles in dust Colorado conditions bike was reset and retuned again and still works ;-) I ride it daily for 20 - 40 miles a day ..."
5,Great Santa Claus Shoe,Feel like I 40 yrs. younger. For a causal shoe for Santa these are Great. I really enjoy them feels great to be able to wear a really well made shoe. Thanks ConverseSANTA GARY
1,ONYZ,"THE RING IS VERY PRETTY WELL MADE, HOWEVER THE ONYX SET MUCH MUCH SMALLERTHAN I THOUGH IT WOULD BE!!!"
5,An Alternative Textbook,"I teach a college course on cross-cultural business, and I have used this book as one of my textbooks for the past 2 years. It is an engaging, practical, non-theoretical, hands-on description of the effect of culture on business practices, with plenty of stories from real-life people and pragmatic advice. I assign a chapter a week, and there is more than enough in 1 chapter to spend an entire week of class on, even though the chapters are not very long. My students love it!"
5,Very Nice Knife,Just as I expected. Was packaged as advertise. Arived as advertised. I will reccomend this product. Very nice. Just as I needed
3,Could be better,"I was not impressed with this product. It looks very sturdy (so I think it will last a REALLY long time) but it wasn't sharp at all. I had bought another Chicago Cutlery knife before (however, it was part of the forum set) and it turned out to be extremely sharp. So, I figured that the brand was good...guess that's not the case."
2,"Terrible, but with some low budget exploitation charm","Terrible dialogue poorly delivered in a cheaply made exploitation film. That said, the movie does have its low budget exploitation charms."
5,Legolas Lover,"I know toybiz could have put her on a more Arwen-like body other than using the Galadriel body.But personally I liked it because I've been using this figure to make several great customs of other LOTR charecters from the books.She's a perfect figure for customizing.I love her beuatiful head garland {very detailed} and her face is perfected!Also you'll love the very lovely slippers on her feet.When customizing a Princess Lothiriel with a Coronation Arwen, I removed the slippers an found that she still had normal feet...I guess it's like this with all of the Arwen figures.Anyway this figure is great so buy her when you can...so far she's been the hardest one to get."
2,I can't get through it.,"I will quickly say that although this is somewhat of an acclaimed book I can't seem to get through it. This has been one of the few times in my life that I couldn't finish a book. It's so uneven I couldn't follow the plot. I will say this: this book is different and that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's a friendship story and a good one in the sense that it's unlike a conventional one. I just can't seem to digest what the author is getting at.(Hey, I didn't go to Harvard and I'm not going to pretend that I know everything under the sun.) I'm sure others will love this book, I didn't. I'll give the author the benefit of the doubt and give two stars because I didn't finish it. I don't know..."
2,SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE PRODUCT,"I did not get the product that i wanted, but the seller's do his best's to correct this problem, unfortunately i can't get the product that i wished.However it's a recommended seller"
4,good book,"I enjoyed this book. I read it for a 11th grade free reading assignment and I had maybe 2 weeks to finish it and i finished it in like 4 days, I couldnt put it down."
5,A Boy Who is Obsessed with Birds,"This is a wonderful novel about a boy who, in many ways, is bird-like. He thinks he is a bird and wants to fly. His obsession with birds ultimately lands him in a psychiatric institution after World War I. This book is told partially through the eyes of a friend who tries to revive him from his catatonic birdlike state.The writing is beautiful and this book is one to be treasured."
3,3 stars i think,"im in the airforce serving in iraq, some of the iraqi nat, guards that i work with were carrying around old arabic to english books with horrable translations and fotos of ""our father sadam"" all over them, including songs about sadam, so i bought a box of these books and gave them to the guards, they seemed really excited to get them, i really have no idea how good the books were or how practical they were, how ever it was really hard to find anything that was arabic-english."
4,Great Product,"Love this product, works great. Took a little longer than I thought it would to receive the item. It all worked out well in the end."
2,not a fifteen pin vga,"i looked, ""searched"" for vga splitter. i saw about twenty or thirty inverted splitters...and then this, the pins on the right side the holes on the right side, reasonable price.....nothing on the next few pages. I'll get it. i wait, it shows up in good time. Yay it's here yay! ummmm what the flip?! 9 pins 9 pins.! who moderates these filters? such a set-up. sorry Ziotek, i've got to scream trap again. TRAP!!! the vga to hdmi i ordered from a different vendor fit but it didn't work....what does a db9 serial run? an old style pre usb monitor or printer. what demographic was using those? is it like a military version or civilian. vatican monitors or paramilitary monitors, what fect do you think would be more inclined to sucker punch cruellty as humor as such?"
3,"Ram OK, but did very little for the printing speed, so disappointed","Have the HP 2550L (uses the same RAM module). Saw very little improvement in printing speed after the upgrade (and its a notoriously slow printer already, so very disappointing).The price is right with the Kingston Ram - the original HP memory is so overpriced it hard to believe they can sell it."
2,Nancy Drew of the 90's,"Although I read the book in a matter of hours, I was a little disappointed in the authors writing style and depth of delivery given her list of accomplishments ( contained extensively on the last page of the book) I would like to have seen more thought go into the development of her characters. Notwithstanding the story lines' focus on the death of a ""typical white female"", I was somewhat disappointed that the author did not see fit to put at least one positive black male role model in the book. After all, I am sure there is one in the New Haven area! Just reminded me of Nancy Drew novels that I read some 20 years ago. Not particulary appealing to mature audiences."
2,Too Many Coincidences,In her first book a Darker Shade of Crimson there was some sense in the story because Nikki Chase was operating in her home environment. This book deals with a murder at Yale of a righr wing law professor. It is hard to understand why Nikki even was around. It also missed the interesting characters from the earlier effort. Nikki's boyfriend Dante is really hard to understand. He appears for no reasonAll in all a book that is very hard to believe and is disappointing.
3,Mixed bag -- almost worth the time,"Refecting a mixture of other reviews here on Amazon, I found this book to have some strong points but also a lot of weak points. T-G writes very entertainingly, but her character development and plot structure leave a lot to be desired. We get only a superficial view of the characters, and the plot has too many unlikely coincidences, such as Nikki repeatedly being close enough to overhear others secretly discussing their actions or motivations yet hidden enough that they don't even realize she is there. Has the overall feel of Ludlum's books, which I also find tediously one-dimensional (although T-G can write a better sentence.) Blue Blood is more of a thriller/page-turner than a serious detective novel such as those produced by Sara Paretsky, whom T-G claims to greatly admire. There is just not enough depth here for me to recommend this to anyone."
2,Another Chance,"After reading the first Ivy League mystery,(A Darker Shade of Crimson), I was disappointed, but I decided I would give the second book Blue Blood a shot, I am wondering to myself why did you put yourself through this torture of another boring book. I very quickly became bored with the book, and for what was going on with Nikki and Dante' in the first book the way it ended who would have thought thet that their relationship could get even more boring, for these two people there was no romance to speak of a kiss was almost mention, but that's it. So to bring Dante back into Nikki's life after an eight year absence, Pamela Griffin-Thomas could have left him out all together as much romance that was not between them, Nikki should have just stay without someone."
3,All the colors of Higher Ed....,"I saw this on my list of recommendations and started w/the first one - A Darker Shade of Crimson. Honestly - I'm glad I did. THAT ONE WAS GOOD...a real page turner...a quick read. This one was a little lower on the scale and currently I'm reading ""Orange Crushed""...set in (you guessed it) Princeton U. While I appreciate the Black heroine .... I'm not sure if this is going to be a long term series at all I.L. colleges. I mean - realistically ... how many excuses can PTG use to get Nikki to those campuses?"
4,A book that opens otherwise closed doors,"I had just finished reading Ms. Graham's first book ""A Darker Shade of Crimson"" when I picked up and began to read her latest work, ""Blue Blood."" Having the unique distinction of having been a student at Yale I was not sure what to expect. What I found was an excellent portrayal of New Haven, the university, and the issues that hold a certain gravity on campus. The mystery is skillfully woven into the great fabric of life in this dark and drab town and plays out very well. Still I felt that this work did lack some of the mystery and twists and turns that made ""Crimson"" such a wonderfully intriguing mystery."
4,The book was very intriguing.,"I like how descriptive Graham is, and the overall situations that the characters are interwined in. The story keeps you guessing until the very end."
1,Nancy Drew,Nancy Drew meets Quasimodo! Proceed at your own risk if you are over 12 years old or have an IQ over 80. Unless you are stuck at the Mexico City airport like I was and can't find anything else on the shelf. An author with her credentials should know better.
2,not done very well,"The descriptions on the backs of the DVDs ton't match what actually happens in the episode. I mean REALLY don't match, not something little. ie, (SPOILER ALERT) it is written that in one 2-parter, Hank sets a huge fire, and then goes to jail for it. Never happened. Also the renegade indian leader is listed with three differnet names.Very dissappointing. And the show itself? Too many ""reminisce"" ones, where they obviously couldn't think of a real shos, so the scrambled together parts of old ones. Kinda sucked, being the last season and all. They did that for 2 of hte last 3 episodes!!"
3,Didn't Want It To End,"The only problem was that I received 2 of disc three and no disc 2. Since I purchased it before I watched the other 5 seasons, it was almost a year before I watched it. When I discovered the mistake, it was too late for Amazon to rectify. I tried to notify the seller, but received no reply. I didn't realize that it was from a third party and not Amazon directly."
3,A Good Show... However...,"My Season Six box set has NO closed-captions and NO subtitles of any kind. For an expensive box set, from a major producer, this is disgraceful!"
5,"Great Series,","I loved this series when it was on TV, and I've wanted to own it since it came out on DVD. The prices of the other seasons are a bit much, but it is without a doubt, worth it."
5,Good deal,"Exactly what I was hoping for. Fast shipment, good price, will make a great gift. Highly recommend it for everyone"
2,Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman - The Complete Season Six,"The service was excelent, but the manufacturer did not check quality. The characters and the sound do not mached, it is very confusing to see lips moving without any voice sound or viceversa. This low quality is in two or three of the DVD's."
4,Dr. Quinn season 6,"Well, to start things off, it is my wife who is the Dr. Quinn finatic. She introduced me to them, and I have seen all the seasons but season 3. Season 6 in many ways is the best, although season 5 is right there with it. Where the other seasons differ from season 6 is in the deaths, and whole community ailments. If you do not want to see a lot of characters die, you might be careful around season 6. But on the flipside, there are a lot of good things happening all through season 6. Marriages, engagements, pregnancies, and all that has come to be vintage Dr. Quinn. I would definately encourage anyone looking to buy a season of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, to consider season 6, as overall, I believe it is one of the best in the series."
5,I LOVE DR. QUINN,Dr. Quinn is the greatest show and I hate that they took it off the air...season 6 is one of the best!!! I love it!
1,Not worth it,"A poor book if you're looking for data on the French Resistance. It dwells mostly on Parisian intellectuals, and while this has some cachet, I found it grossly counter to the way the book is advertised. As an aside, the formatting for the text is nauseating, with small type and indents for every paragraph.Skip this -- it has nothing to offer."
2,You've Got To Be Kidding Me,"There are some good lines, but there is not a single great poem. Some are ... well, just awful -- maudlin, trite, cliched, devoid of any freshness of imagery. This seems utterly like the work of a privileged and successful woman exploiting her cultural heritage, and not even being convincing in the process. The faux-authenticity seems so second-order that anyone with a decent education regarding the history of Korea cringes at the melodrama:I'll never understand it.I wonder about the others I see on the sidewalks,each soul fathomless --Yes, that is an actual passage. The coy allusions, the downtrodden affect, the preponderance of Asian artifacts ... this from a Stanford grad, Fulbright scholar, Yaddo-ite, many times getter of grants? Sorry, the whole thing smells like a put-up job."
3,nice mix of known and obscure soul.,"With most compilations you get a mixed bag, and this is no exception. What is refreshing about this one is the chance to hear some lost soul gems. There are a few recognizable hit songs like Teddy Pendergrass singing the Whole town's laughing at me, and there are many covers. These are the real treats. Dee Dee Sharpe, an excellent vocalist, singing the Manilow song, Trying to get that feeling again, or Erma Franklin giving By the time I get to Phoenix a real soul workout. The O'Jays sing a great version of The Three Degree hit, When will I see you again. Patti LaBelle does a live version of that old chestnut, If you don't know me by now, with her soaring vocals and mid song patter. Billy Paul, an underated singer, lends his jazz/R&B vocals to Without you. All in all a good compilation with some seldom heard 60's and 70's soul music."
3,Adequate but disappointing,"Gershwin's wonderful collection of piano music on this CD is good for aspiring pianists who are intimidated by the impeccable perfection of many artists. Paul Bisaccia is a very stylish player, but at times a little sloppy in his performance. Those who want perfection in their listening would do better with other CDs--I wish I had purchased Gershwin Plays Gershwin: The Piano Roll CD instead. That way I would be sure that any variation in performance was true interpretation and not just a minor problem/mistake in performance that was not corrected for the final recording. Still an enjoyable CD, but not the artistry that I had expected."
1,Rosa,"I like her voice and singing style, but this PROMOTIONAL Cd left me dissapointed. Becuase it is a PROMO CD, I was refunded the full price. Only liked one-song, which it's why I ordered it."
3,Needs help.,"The Palace needs major proofreading. The story was OK, but it read like the author didn't make it beyond fifth grade."
5,LOVE this book!,I got this book after reading the first book. This one didn't disappoint. I couldn't put it down and stayed up late reading it just so I could finish it. And I had to buy the third book as I NEEDED to finish the story! There are lots of plots and twists to keep it exciting.
2,The palace,"This isn't great but it isn't bad either. It moves Very slowly and there is so much additional ""stuff"" that it makes it difficult to stay with the story. If you hang in there the basics of the story are not bad but it's the hanging in there in order to get to that point that is hard"
4,"A good, solid second book of the trilogy!","Jeco has arrived at the King's palace of Kanavar where he works himself up the food chain until he becomes a scribe. During this time, he gains a friend, second-in-command to the king, and also gains a powerful enemy.Well, I don't want to give away any more of the story.However, this book was a solid read and a good follow-up to Book One of the Trilogy. I'm looking forward to reading the final book of the Trilogy. This series deserves a wider audience for fantasy readers: Christian and Secular."
3,Poor excuse for floor mats,"I had just gotten a new car and wanted some fun mats, so I ordered 2 sets of these intending to use one set for the front and one for the back seat. For starters, the mats are really narrow and disproportionately long for the width. So, the only way I can use them in the front is to put them on an angle, but they do not cover the entire area that my feet naturally occupy, so they don't really protect my carpeting. Secondly, they are very soft, thin, and pliable, but the underside does not have anything that keeps it stable on the carpeting, so they slide around and sometimes creep up onto the accelerator. Third, they are hard to clean. If I knew then what I know now, I would not have bought them. Don't waste your money."
2,reviewer reviewed,"as I read this morning Krauss's NYT review of another book on Central America, [Silence on the Mountain by Daniel Wilkinson] I realized that there was little review on the new book but more reference to Krauss's own ideological views on how to analyze the situation in Guatemala. Although I think what he writes in ""Inside Central America"" offers his perspectives on the politics of this part of the world, I found that a better addition would be to read Wilkinson's recent book. Amazing prose and insights that had not been written on these chapters of Guatemalan history."
5,Trace has a SWINGIN' hit on his hands,"I saw Trace in concert just 2 days before ""Dangerous Man"" was released and he sung some of the new songs off of this CD and they totally AWESOME...This CD definitely is one of Trace's BEST yet...It has everything country, bluesy feel, and Southern Rock...EVERY song is ABSOLUTELY worth buying it...CONGRATS Trace on a F-I-N-E piece of work"
1,Willie changes the station,"I caught part of the video for ""Girls Love Country Boys"". This is so bad over the top it's a like a Weird Al Yankovic video with beatiful women thrown in to get people's attention. I'm thinking Willie changes the station when this comes on."
3,I Wanna Feel Something,"I didn't like the last album, and was really hoping that this newest collection would be better. I'm sorry to say that I'm only marginally less disappointed with ""Dangerous Man"". The title track is probably the best song on the album. Of the rest of the tracks, ""Words Get In The Way"" would be my other pick, since I'm a sucker for ballads. The rest don't move me. I guess ""I Wanna Feel Something"" is the truest song on the album, which pretty much sums it up for me, too."
4,Great Album,Its hard for me to find albums I enjoy all the way and this one fell just a little short. Never the less I really enjoyed the majority of the songs.
2,Warning: Grooved,"This is a grooved, rather than a straight steel. This means it is taking significant portions of metal off your edge with each pass (that's the job of a sharpening tool, not a honing tool!). The grooves risk significant damage to your blade. The grooving is sort of apparent from the photo, but it should be made more explicit. Consider yourself forewarned!"
5,best value sharpening steel,"I've gone through several powered and manual sharpening tools looking for something that will put an edge on my knives that my father, a retired chef, won't scoff at, and this is by far the best I've found. And when you factor in its low price, this steel is an unbeatable value. I was able to put a razor sharp edge on everything from a 30 year old chinese cleaver to my wife's expensive Henkels to a set of as-seen-on-tv ""never needs sharpening"" knives using this steel. I was surprised by how quickly it sharpens - just takes a few passes. It does take off quite a bit of metal, works better for sharpening than honing. I'll keep my ceramic rod for honing."
3,Third time is not a charm,"What can I say? I loved the first book, liked the second and tolerated the third. Probably more an issue with the publishing racket than anything against the author. While I enjoyed this third installment of the Kovac's book, this one is very far removed from the gritty nior feel that the first one was able to engender in it's readers. Good story, good mechanics, the characters are pretty good as well. It just isn't the first book."
2,hard work,I found this disappointing after the first couple of books. The format worked better in the first book when it was much more of a cyber punk / detective style. This story just did not engage me as much and seem confused as to what the main driving point was. The two underlying plot lines of revenge and political intrigue overlap without ever really combining in a convincing manner. I'd stick with Altered Carbon and leave it with that if I were you.
2,Lacks motivation,"I enjoyed Altered Carbon, but have been disappointed in the sequels, including this one. As before, the world is constructed in exquisite and credible detail. However, the story line lacks momentum, coherence, and most of all lacks motivation and purpose, and I found it hard to keep my attention from wandering. I came away from reading this novel thinking that some aggressive editing could have done a lot of good."
3,Weakest out of the 3,"Up until last year I hadn't read a sci-fi themed booked in over 6 years. The genre, it seemed to me, had fissled out after years of rehashing plot, characters, and tech. Then a friend of mine suggested I pick up Morgan's first book Altered Carbon because it was ""wicked sick"". So, I did. And to my surprise I was hooked almost immediately. I read the book in a day and then went out and bought Morgan's second Takeshi Kovac's novel Broken Angel's. I read it just as fast and enjoyed it almost as much.8 months went by before I had the time to read Woken Furies and I went into this novel fully expecting a book on par with the last one...but was disappointed. I'm not an English Professor or major so I can't pick apart the book in minute detail and tell you what elements were lacking. It just was. After finishing the novel it felt like Morgan had used Woken Furies as vehicle to exercise a pseudo proxy midlife crisis instead of furthering a great character and story."
5,Morgan's Kovacs never lets you down,"Good Stuff, just like the other Richard K Morgan stuff I've read. This one is exciting and continues to build on some of the hinted at things Morgan showed us in earlier Kovacs novels. Worth it if you liked Altered Carbon and Broken Angels. If you sampled either, and didn't like em, don't bother with this one!"
2,Does this story ever evolve ?,"Hi there. I really enjoyed the other two Kovacs books, but this one is just far too tedious for me. Does the story line EVER evolve? Very intricate detail spent on things which don't advance the story I feel....I've got it in audio format, and enjoyed the reader in the other two stores much better, so maybe that has something to do with it. I am some 3 hours into the story, and nothing much has happened. I read to be entertained and captured, and this one doesnt do it, so perhaps if you are listening to this in audio format, the abridged version may be the better choice."
4,Dark and awesome,"Great extrapolative imagining of future tech with strangely believable, evocative, gritty emotional weirdness stemming from the mechanization and extension of humanity. Heavy violence and sex."
4,"Tak is back...but as a lover, please...","There are some very interesting story lines here which are left open, possibly for future books? The love scenes, are needed for the storyline, but they need not have been done in such a graphic fashion. I don't think that I would permit my pre-teen son to read this book. The main plot is a good one, but there are certainly underdeveloped segments which could use better development, I won't elaborate so as to be a spoiler. The overall the story is a good and compelling read. The ending leaves you wanting the next book in the line.."
1,Altered Carbon fans stay away,"Altered Carbon is one of my favorite books from the last 10 years. The world created by Morgan was fascinating, full of potential. However, the second book Broken Angels, was a major let down, and now the third book Woken Furies is worse still. If you liked the first novel, and are looking for more of the same, DO NOT READ WOKEN FURIES. You will be horribly disappointed. The plot is a rambling mess. Kovacs is a mopey character that you can not feel any connection to. Basically, there is nothing engaging about this novel. My interest in these Tokeshi Kovacs novels had been fueled by my admiration for the first novel, but now that is over. No more Kovac novels for me."
5,A Great Second Volume,"This second volume continues on the main three themes of the Vol. 1 -1. Footwork training2. Body training3. Palm training(And Chi Kung)Added notes include:Various types of stepping, various types of walking the circle, more body conditioning movements, kou bu and bai bu applications, more of the ""48 month palms"", elbow training .. and of course, plenty more.In general, an extremely worthwhile addition to any Bagua student's library - by far some of the best books in print."
3,The fundamentals of pa kua chang vol 1 & 2,What I liked: the emphasis on knowing the principles(especially the footwork) rather than the forms.What I didn't like: the repetitive nature of the explanations seemed like an old record stuck in its groove rather than a reinforcement of explanations.Two volumes: I think with better editing one volume would have been possible.I did not have the companinion videos with my order but found it posted on youtube.Suitable for beginners and those with some experience in ba gua zhang
3,Direct from China Don't Bother,The title says it all. A cheap knock off from the better Eastern manufacturers. You can easily do much better. Shipping is 1/3 the cost again of the item. Not Recommended.
4,engaging story,"This movie is a good introduction to the Maori people of New Zealand. One of the main problems of the Maori is highlighted in this film -- alcoholism and how it effects families. The 2003 film, Whale Rider, shows a lighter side of the Maori culture while Once Were Warriors is darker yet also provides a look at some of the older customs that are seen in Whale Rider.For the most part, this is an unhappy story but there is a beauty in the acting and the culture that makes the film well worth seeing."
3,Like this product,Think I will like this brush but I think it going to be too short for most of my canning jars.
4,Gimli,"The splinter/box he came in was dented in 2 places, the figure remains in good shape though. His ""coat"" is brown, not blue like it shows in the photo."
3,minimal scent,"light foam is ok, but seriously lacking in scent, not pleased! no more orders from this customer"
1,Worst Chemistry book on the market,My school uses this book. This book is the worst book I have ever used. Poor explainations. Poor examples. Even advanced students find it convoluted. PLEASE AVOID TAKING CHEMISTRY FROM THIS BOOK.
1,Only used because of kickbacks to Chemistry departments!,"This is the POOREST excuse for a general chemistry book I've ever seen! If I could rate it NEGATIVE stars I would! Every moment with this book is a nightmare! The only reason the publisher is able to unload it is because Chemistry departments get a KICKBACK from the publisher for requiring it! Without the kickback from the publisher, this JOKE for a chemistry book would fade away into oblivion! AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COSTS! If your school requires it, find somewhere else to take chemistry!"
1,so confusing...,The book is so confusing and it's written almost like the author is just talking....it's funny.. u read and it's just like the author is talking to himself or something.. like a conversation with another Ph.D!! or himself....there were also many (well relatively few compared to the whole number of questions) errors in the answers.... this is really frustrating as u think u've done something wrong.. but u really haven'tI used this book along with Raymond Chang's Chemistry for my first year chemistry class (this book was the REQUIED text and Chang's was the REFERENCE text) and I personally think Chang's is much better because he talks at ur level... it's almost like he understands we're beginners while this author doesn't...I'm sure there are even better chem books out there.. just avoid this one at all costs
1,Unnecessarily wordy and Too Many Typos,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. DO NOT GET THE SOLUTIONS MANUAL. I REPEAT, DO NOT.The textbook is grueling and never gets to the point. Too wordy. You'll hate it. It'll lengthen every single unnecessary explanation but barely skim over important topics and details (NEVER WILL IT EXPLAIN ANYTHING IMPORTANT).The solutions manual has so many typos. Don't they proofread? If I'm going to pay any sort of money for my education, and if this ridiculous book is also going to overcharge me for it, then at least be less ignorant and more professional. Just proofread. I don't want to spend valuable time on correcting my work with wrong answers (FROM THE ANSWER BOOK). That's too much frustration that I don't have time for.This book is horrible."
5,Perfect Condition!,"It is in perfect condition! It is barely highlighted, no torn pages and the cover is not worn at all! Shipping was pretty fast too."
1,Engineer's Opinion,I have taken many chemistry courses throughout my highschool and college career. This book has by far been the worst chemistry book I have ever read. The extremely poor organization of examples and confusing diction is not helpful to anyone taking a general chemistry course. You will have a much more successful time using your old highschool chemistry books as references.
1,No clear cut directions on how to solve the problems,"I have taken several chemistry courses in high school and college. However i find this book to be very difficult in understanding. I find myself refering back to my old notes and books. There are surely more chemistry books out there that could explain chemistry itself in a more efficient manner. This book does not contain any clear cut directions on how to solve many problems, in addition to containing many problems in the exercises section which was also not explained the lecture part of the book. The practice problems also does not help in solving many of the problems because it is simple and straightforward as opposed to the exercises which is very misleading and unclear. I, as a science major, do not recommend this book unless of course you are required to purchase it by a professor who does not care for you to pass the class."
3,Any textbook would be better lol,"The textbook itself is awful, probably one of the worst I've ever read for Chemistry but the solutions manual is very thorough and helpful"
1,Confusing,"I think that this book is very hard to follow. Although the pictures and diagrams are good, the text is confusing. This was not a good reference to help me in my general chem course."
1,filled with and excess of mediocrity,although this book is used for teaching general chemistry at many universities and is praised by the proffesors it bears within it tongue twisting sentences that relay less concepts then the number of words used to convey them. personally i learned more chemistry from my seventh grade teacher than this book.
3,"Lever ""lock"" is great, but wears out","I have owned a couple of these and the lever system is the most intuitive for me. Unfortunately, its just plastic on the blade that keeps it locked, and that plastic wears over time. If you use it every day, you might get a year out of it if you are lucky. I get maybe two years. Granted, its only $10 or so, but I hate throwing things like this out. Without a way to lock the blade, its pretty much worthless to me."
1,Lousy Product,This product is absolutely useless for carpentry work. The fact that it is a split scale with metric units on one side make it difficult to align if you are doing edge measurements. Come on what % of framing/carpentry measurements use metric units. If you have all day to use a tape measure you can make it work but if you want to get stuff done quickly on the job site there are much better products. Very poorly thought out design which will do nothing but frustrate the weekend warrior / contractor.
2,This is a toy,"This is adequate for children to play with in the backyard, but certainly not a piece of camping gear."
4,Spinervals Competition DVD 13.0 - Tough Love,"The workout is good and is intended for an advance rider as suggested. You will sweet! I have yet to complete the 3 hour session do to time (only had it a month). I do like the fact that there is three hours of training if I want it. The workout focuses on keeping your heart rate at the 85% level for a large part of the session--right at the lactate threshold. For me, at 55, I can get there pretty fast. I am no triathlete, but did ride in a couple of centuries in 2012 and will be riding the Death ride (tour of the Alps) with some friends here in 2013.For me I would rather adjust my workout with room to improve than master it and have to buy another workout in the future, and I wanted something more than an hour long. The background music is okay, not obnoxious metal music and the set is pretty cool, some museum somewhere.My reason for a 4 star rating is: the DVD quality is good, a 3 on a scale of 1 to 5 and the price is steep."
1,Boring,I watched parts of it. One of my roomates was in a zombie stare watching it or the wall behind the tv?My other roomate said it was a great movie. I thought it was a boring mix of formulas. Same good guy/bad guy stuff and really dull. I like action movies like T1 & T2 and Matrix and Mad Max I and some of the Leathal Wepon movies but this was just another run of the mill no-brainer no-fun movie.
1,Tragically bad rubbish,"Don't get me wrong here, I liked 'The Rock'. I thought it was beautifully filmed, honest, well edited and convincingly well enough acted. 'Con Air', however, was another kettle of fish, to use the saying. The plot was just far far too implausible, even for a member of the dreaded action genre. The message was, well, I'm not really sure if there was one to be honest. Apart from good people stay good and bad people stay bad. Deep huh. The cinemanographic techniques (slow motion, etc) worked well in 'The Rock' but here, as in 'Face/Off' (which is also equally bad), they just don't cut it. They seem tacked on just to give the movie a more 'arthouse' feel (which would no doubt lost on the average action fan anyway). Scripting was ridiculous, dialogue was appalling and dialogue was even worse. Avoid this movie. Try 'A Simple Plan', 'A Clockwork Orange' or 'Apocalypse Now' if you really want to delve into good and bad."
1,DVD does not work!!!!!,the DVD that I was sent must be from Britain or somewhere else because my DVD players says it will not play this foreign disk . you should post that on the website!!!
5,great deal,always have liked this movie so i looked up on here and order it. it came sooner than expected. Love it
4,So much going on i included ( ) ( ),"Con air comes across as a little too far fetched towards the end (hence the four stars) but apart from that minor error it's an enjoyable film to watch, like many films the main plot is about a hi-jacking of a plane but what i like about this film is that there is a twist as there are prisoners on board this plane some dangerous rapists, exiles, petty theives and many others like the most pre-eminent (cirus the virus aka John Malkovich). Nicholas Cage plays Cameron Poe who kills a man (self defence) after been attacked himself (no justice) and gets carted off to this maximum security prison because of what he's done and ends up on the plane thats heading back (after a period of time) so he can re-unite with his wife, however the dangerous convicts and prisoners end up getting free and raise hell on this plane which is the catalyst for the whole film, it's definatley an adrenaline fueled film so i'd recommened people who like action films."
3,A Bit Misleading,"I purchased this movie two months ago expecting it to detail a new hair dryer model from the popular maker of hair manipualtion appliances. What I actually recieved was an utter disappointement. It has nothing to do with hair dryers, but rather tells the story of a group of CONvicts who overtake an AIRplane transferring them to another prison--hence the misleading name of the movie. While I must admit that the movie was filled with suspense, and was actually quite enjoyable--Nicholas Cage is a terrific actor--it was nothing I would have knowingly purchased. So beware--If you are expecting a DVD about hairdryers, do not buy this. However, if you are looking for an action-packed thriller, this is for you."
4,Great film - pathetic use of DVD,"I won't harp on too much about the movie. It made so much money that almost everyone must have seen it at the cinema. What hacks me off is the dreadful use of DVD. This little shiny disc can hold so much and all you get is the film and a couple of trailers. Why not include a ""making of"" feature, a cast sheet, cut scenes and so forth? There's plenty of room for them. At the moment, unless you're desperate for the extra audio quality, you're better saving some cash and just buying the VHS version. Virtually every movie company is guilty of this, so I'm not picking on Con Air's owners. If you pay so much more for a film, you should get your moneys worth, especially when you consider how much cheaper DVDs are to manufacture than tapes."
2,I expected more,"Maybe my expectations were a little high. I never saw this movie in the theaters so I recently watched this extended edition on DVD. Nicholas Cage has a terrible southern accent throughout the movie - why - I'm not sure as his character doesn't need to be from the south. And I thought the law enforcement was a bit over the top with the macho, kill everyone, innocents be damn attitude and in fighting. There was a lot a action but most of the time I thought it was just stupid. For example, an under cover cop posing as a con had a concealed gun and the second he was released he pulled it out instead of waiting until he could get the ring leader who had the only other gun. Overall I was disappointed in this movie."
2,Con Air: A Timeless Classic,"Con Air is one of Nicholas Cage's finest films. Long before the National Treasure series, Nicholas Cage was ""sticking it to the man"" by growing out his hair and proudly displaying his mullet. My only regret is that he did not have it gold-plated.But the film itself is a much more complex thing of wonder.Sorrysorrytoo tired to be ironic.this thing blows."
1,Ironic.... ly bad,"Amazon, of course, is trying to sell you this movie so its review claims the movie is ""ironic"" in an attempt to justify the ankle-deep plot and paper-thin characters. Mmmm.... yeah. I normally think Maltin is too family values, but I agree with him on this one. Maybe this movie appeals to younger viewers who are more interested in seeing things ""blown up real gud"", but a relentless string of explosions and crashes do not, in and of themselves, make a film exciting. I just wanted it to be over. If you're looking for a film of this genre, The Rock isn't a real brain twister either, but it's quite a bit more satisfying than Con Air. Better yet, try The Professional which has gunplay, explosions AND a good story and good characters. Imagine that."
5,A High flying adventure.,"Nicolas Cage stars in the 1997 Action blockbuster ""Con Air"", which tells the story of a Prisoned man who is now coming back to his home on a plane called "" Con Air"" that is taken over by criminals including "" Cyrus the Virus"" ( John Malkovic).Awesome and entertaining movie that is hard-hitting action at it's finest from Jerry Bruckheimer and on my list of the best movies of 1997. The DVD is stupendous with it's quality picture and digital sound, with a Teaser and Trailer, it's a must own action movie for fans of the genre and you'll have a wholloping good time."
4,"Good, and funny","It's explosive and funny. I really liked this one. Definetely recommended along with these: Broken Arrow, The World Is Not Enough(007, James Bond), Face/Off, The Rock, Terminator 2 and the 1st, just for some of the action lovers, great movies, I thought the Matrix was the worst film of 1999(not counting Titanic), whoever said that was good, give me a break! But let's get back to ConAir, it's awesome and fun. two simple words, k. Cage serves his time in prison for 10 years then gets stuck going home with convicted murderers who seize control of the plane, taking all the officers hostages, and killing the pilots, one of the major criminals is Malcovich and the other is Ving Rhaemes(also in Entrapment, Out Of Sight and Pulp Fiction). John Cusak is an officer. Good movie and full of entertainment, TWO THUMBS UP!!!! Not the greatest though, but good!"
2,STANDARD ACTION FARE,"Nicolas Cage is the good guy against a plane load of bad guys who are being taken to more maximum security facilities. Cage (as Cameron Poe) , if I recall correctly, was wrongly imprisoned and is going to be released. He has the misfortune of hitching a ride on this plane of very dangerous criminals who are hatching a plan to hijack the plane. John Malkovich is expertly diabolical here, and Steve Buscemi is always a welcome player. And Cage flexes his action hero muscles (who would ever have guessed he had them before The Rock?) Overall this is an entertaining and action-filled film full of memorable action-hero one-liners, a few surprises here and there, major explosions and a happy ending. You could not want more if this is your kind of film."
4,Typical Cage!,"Great movie. Gave it as a gift. I enjoyed watching the movie myself, after I gave it I borrowed it back."
3,Glitches on tape,"Even though we enjoyed the movie, towards the end, there were several ""glitches"" on the tape and we didn't know if we would be able to see the end of the movie."
3,MY MISTAKE,"I had the director wrong, it's not Brian De Palma it's Simon West. My comments still hold though."
2,"So, where's the extras?","Nothing. Not even a trailer. What a wasted opportunity for a commentary by West (who does do them -- he did one for When A Stranger Calls) or a retrospective featurette.All you do get with this extended version is additional dialogue between Cusack's character and a female law enforcement officer in a hanger, footage of a prison riot during the opening credits montage and a few more graphic shots of hapless inmates being killed during the course of the movie."
1,Don't buy Con Air R2,"For all of us living in Europe and having thoughts about buying the region 2 encoding I just wanted to mention that Con Air region 2 is cut for what I think is the german audiences. (I am not talking about the Con Air english reg. 2 which may be uncut) The cuts are: 1. When ""Pinball"" burns the Indian. 2. When Cyrus burns the drugkingpin. 3. Cyrus falling through electrical lines. 4. Cyrus death scene. The Region 1DVD has no cuts and include both the Trailer and a Teaser Trailer (the region 2 doesn't)."
2,"Casual violence, this film is not a favorite","Glamorizes the crimes of hardcore criminals, including a character whose nickname is derived from the number of women he has raped. Deaths occur often in this film and are even supposed to be funny, like a black convict chasing a plane he's trying to get on, and flipping off the pilot just as he's chopped into a bloody mess by the propellers. When people laughed at that, I wanted to walk out. The entertainment value doesn't justify the casual, no-consequences approach to violence taken by the makers of the film."
1,Absolute garbage,"Lots and lots of things being blown up. That's about all I really got out of this flick. Things that are noticeably absent here: a plot and decent acting. I guess the producers figured they could cover up the bad script with cheap Hollywood stunts and gimmicks. If you have nothing better to do for two hours than be entertained by explosions and cheap thrills, then this film is for you. However, if you are in search of an intelligent film, or anything even remotely intelligent, look elsewhere."
5,Great Action Movie,Great movie to watch on a cold rainy day in front of a crackling fire. Great fun.
5,Good Movie!,"Con Air is a good movie with decent action and acting. It has drama, some dry humor and even a bit of romance. Nicholas Cage and John Malkovich are really great as adversaries. The only thing that I would change about this movie is Nic's southern accent. It's okay but a bit too twangy. Other than that, it's a fantastic movie. I could watch it again and again."
3,full of entertaining actions + Lots of explosions.,It's full of entertaining actions and lots of explosions. Don't expect logic from the plot. Over-the top but good acting.
3,decent,"As an action movie, this wasn't too bad. It stars Nicolas Cage as a military man who has just been discharged and accidentally kills a man in a drunken bar fight while defending his pregnant wife. Even though it's manslaughter, he still gets a harsher sentence because, as the judge tells him, ""with your military skills, you are a deadly weapon and are not subject to ordinary laws."" 8 years later he is paroled and eager to see his daughter (with whom he has been corresponding via letters) for the first time;unfortunately, the plane home gets hijacked by the nastiest criminals you can imagine.John Cusack and Colm Meaney make decent good guys trying to get him home, and Cage makes a good hero. The action and explosion scenes are terrific, and Malkovich is top-notch as the nasty lead bad guy in a good cast. You might want to see this one."
3,If you like no-brain Action Flicks...,"... where you only have to put up your feet, hang on to your beer and your sweetheart for the occasional distraction :-) this movie is FOR YOU. It's just plain and simple ACTION at it's best. If at all possible, I think they would not even had bothered with a human cast or a ""so-called"" plot. Best line of the movie: ""I told you to put the bunny back into the box"" - Cage sports a nasty mane :-) and lots of muscles. He's good in just about every role but then again you can only be so good as your script... Two Thumbs down from me :-), sorry Nic!"
3,it's a good movie but too bad without english subtitles,it's a good movie but too bad without english subtile
3,Another Action movie,It's a pretty neat story.. if you like alot of action.. it's not bad.. but not at all the best movie ever made!matt
1,Thumbs Down,"Regardless of the new extras and restored scenes, this dvd has a terrible video transfer. Horizontal edges have more edge enhancement than even the infamously bad SWEP1 Phantom Menace dvd. The overall picture is reduced to near vhs quality from the excessive ringing.Absolutely avoid this Z-grade transfer unless you have a 13"" tv or don't care at all about video quality."
2,"Nice story, but...","My wife told me the whole story before watching it. It sounded interesting. But once I saw John Malkovich I groaned? This is supposed to be the bad guy? He's laughable. Who would be scared of that geek? Seriously, I was more entertained with my wife telling me the story."
2,Good rental,"Some movies are good to see when you're stressed out at the job, lost your wallet, or otherwise want to park your brain. There were only two good actors here: Malkovich and Buscemi. Everyone else was passable, even Cage, Rhames and Cusack.Did anyone else notice that Mkeylti Williamson played essentially the same role that he did in Forest Gump? Wounded black man saved by a white man? The so-called black revolutionary lead on by a white man. Even after Cage pointed that out to him, the revolutionary still didn't get it. The only classic scene is when Buscemi explains to Cage what insanity really is. You almost get caught up in his explanation when it does take Cage to get us out.Otherwise it's a standard action movie that does have a lot of visual gags. Those of you who hated it, watch again this time but ignore the thin plot and watch the gags. That you will get a kick out of. It shows the film's producers having a little sense of humor."
3,never brilliant,when it fist came out all my friends were telling me how awsome it was so i decided to go have a look for myself and to tell you the truth i was disipointed it never realy caught me up in it just a bunch of cons who hijack a plane trust me you have seen it before.
1,I Call Shenanigans!,"Shame on you Disney, for trying to bleed me of my hard-eard money.I call Shenanigans"
1,"Darn, I can't give out ZERO stars","Has there ever been a movie by Bruckheimer and/or Simpson and/or Michael Bay worth the celluloid it was filmed on?Okay, Enemy of the State was a good flick ... but the everything else is trash, and most especially Con Air.Who in Hollywood figured this was a good idea?"
1,"Back to the well, and this one was shallow to begin with...","I hate to admit I actually own this thing on VHS. And unless my mind is going more than usual, I have this cut of the movie too.Double (and more) dipping by the studios seems to be the way of DVD. We get at least four issues of Terminator 2, but none of Robinson Crusoe on Mars. I personally am sick of it.Director's Cuts, Unrated Editions, and other snaky ways of trying to separate my money from my wallet. No wonder I've taken to borrowing nearly all my DVDs from the Public Library.No, you generally don't get them the day they come out. But honestly, when was the last time you purchased a movie from Hollyweird that was worth keeping? Don't do it!"
2,Nothing Special,"Nicolas Cage's acting hits an all-time low in this movie with one of the worst characters he's ever played. The film tries in numerous way to entertain, but it just didn't click with me."
4,Never ending thrill ride,"Con Air is the reason they make big screen TVs. If you have or can find someone who has a projector, even better. The action in this flick is top-notch. Not only that, but it keeps giving you more... there's about 3 places it could stop before it does, but in the end you don't mind the extra time because it just means more action. Cage is excellent as the one who ""couldn't leave a fallen man behind"".The only point I take off is for Cage's annoying attempt at a southern accent. It's only really apparent at the beginning, though, you get used to it as the movie goes on."
4,Great film if a little predictable at times,"This film has it all - an original plot, great action sequences, humour and lots of guns and explosions. The plot, although original is very predictable at times and the DVD lacks extra featues, but overall a great movie."
4,Cool!!!,"I bought this book and expected the same old sci fi formula. Boy was i suprised. This book takes the old space opera and puts it into the life of realistic modern day teens and does it well. What a fresh read and with such vibrant, truly human heroes. A+It's definately worth the money :)"
1,Bad mixing old and new music instruments - Dupplicate CD...,"Be carefull..... this CD is a dupplication of 2 other CDs with different titles, they are: ""Vietnam - Toutes Les Musique Du Monde"" and ""Greetings From Vietnam"". Here is the review from ""Greetings From Vietnam"":""If you are expecting an authentic Vietnamese traditional music, this CD is not a right one for you. Ten out of 20 songs (2, 4, 7, 10 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and 20) are playing by the Western guitar, not the Vietnamese traditional music instruments. This constraint ""marriage"" is very unpleasant to listen to."""
1,if I could rate it lower I would...,this book is worthless...I've bought and successfully used clep study guides by REA and Comex... they are both excellent. All CLEP study guides by Rudman are absolutely worthless. I feel like this guy is a scammer...probably a small market for these books and this guy is taking advantage of the fact no other study guides exist for this test...DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.
2,The Johnny Appleseed of Handguns,"This film is lackluster and often unintentionally comical. Eddie Murphy is the Johnny Appleseed of handguns is this film. He uses a clip, tosses the weapon, uses a clip, tosses the weapon over and over and over again. San Francisco PD could solve their armed street crime problem easily if they would just get Murphy off the streets. He litters the streets with enough guns to arm a small army. Too much gun play, not enough consideration for a quality script. Give this picture a miss."
5,Underrated Action Flick!,"I can't believe some of these reviews. Eddie Murphy gave a great performance in this one, as did everyone else. Metro is the story of how a big-shot detective, Scott Roper (Eddie Murphy) cracks a hard case. Now, the convict has actually broken out and taken someone dear to Roper hostage. It's up to Roper to retrieve not only the stolen goods, but now to rescue his girlfriend and put an end to all this chaos. This is a well-played Murphy role and should be seen at least once."
1,Evaporated,Had lid tight and only used it a few times and when I went to use it it had all evaporated.
1,Horrible,"I wanted to buy an expensive knife and did not know too many name brands so I decided to get one we have had for so many years and did well ""Chicago Cutlery"". I really do not think these are real because within a week, I found rust marks and are they dull or what. I would not be buying these anymore. I just ordered a Wusthof knife, I guess it is supposed be a lot better. I will update you when I get them."
3,Hidden drawback,"These are as nice as any Chicago Cutlery knife (good heft for a steak knife). The hidden drawback is the curve in the blade. Gives you a nice angle to cut your steak, but it makes storing them a bit tricky. They poke up out of the flat knife holder I've got. Think about how you're going to store these before you buy them. They do a nice job other than that."
5,"Great Value, Great Knives!","These knives are sharp and cut meat well.The New Best Recipe: All-New Edition 2004 (5 Stars*****) cookbook, which you should seriously consider buying if you don't already own a copy, ranked these knives #3, just after 2 vastly more expensive, name-brand knives, so I bought them. The knives are not serrated, so I can easily sharpen them like any other kitchen knife."
3,Sometimes technology is not good,"We purchsed a set of 4 steak knives because we lost one of our originals and the only way to replace is was to buy the set. No problem with that. When they arrived we found them to be basically the same but ""modernized"". Our original knives have the model number burned into the walnut handle. The new knives have the logo lazer etched into the blade. So, sadly, they do not match. Technology is great, but sometimes the old way is better. This is one of those times. Small matter? yes. Sad? yes!"
4,nice straight edge,Pretty decent knives. I gave it 4 stars because the price was great. Walnut handles I find to work well for me as I don't like the synthetic feeling handles. Seem to hold up well. Blade can be straightened/sharpened. Well balanced but a little light feeling in the hand (prefer a bit heavier feel). Blades seem to resist stain pretty well (have a small spot on one probably due to gave up on hand washing only and have 'allowed' 2 of them to go into the dishwasher). Also use as utility knife and boning knife.Would buy again if budget was the same.
1,Soft metal,"I own a few other Chicago Cutlery knives that work just fine, but this set seems to be made from a much softer metal. These knives dull very quickly and when I sharpen them, they wear down extremely fast."
3,Okay for the price,"It's hard to find steak knives that don't have serrations, which rip meat instead of slicing, or skinny handles that are uncomfortable. These can be sharpened to produce a very good edge. Alas, the steel is pretty mediocre so they don't hold the edge for long. Handles are okay, nothing special but not terrible. Blade shape is pretty good. I'll keep these for when we have larger parties but will keep looking for some nice ones for more frequent use."
2,Won't keep an edge,"I bought a set of these several years ago and finally replaced them. Despite proper storage and honing, they just won't keep an edge. Additionally, they are a bit too flexible for cutting through a very large steak.On the plus side, when they are sharp they handle most cuts of meat reasonably well."
4,A Page Turner,"This book is a very enjoyable read - I read it in a weekend.I found it to be a ""page turner"" - very believable characters, lots of little twists as the story unfolds. I really felt the mother's grief - well written, not over done.I could see where this would be a book that both adults and teenagers could read, and get different things from the story."
5,Hilarious and Adorable,"10 Things I Hate About You is a finely crafted and well-acted masterpiece in the teen movie genre. The young actors in this comedy play their updated Shakespeare-inspired characters well, and help explain the Bard to a younger generation in a much easier and less ""Thou-filled"" manner.Unfortunately, this movie was released at a time when a lot of teen movies were coming out, and all of the movies seemed to have a common thread of a guy getting paid to take out a girl (or betting on dates). At that time it seemed a bit annoying, but now, it's just cool that so many were released because it gives teens a better selection. 10 Things is definitely one of the best selections that a teen (or a person of any age) could make."
5,teenage flick with intellect,"i have to recommend this to any one who wants to see teenagers with brains. one wouldn't think by the title that this movie is special, but it is. i will admit that i got this movie because i really like heath ledger; however, even if he were not part of the cast, i would still love it. i enjoyed this film because the dialogue is so mature ( i mean, who uses word like ""engorged"" or ""antiquated"" with literal knowledge of their meanings?) and the characters are so realistic. even the unintelligent ones hae their own ingenuity in at least one aspect. and the music is fantastic. i'm not a big rock and roll person, but these songs made me experience the characters' emotions simultaneously with them. oh, and i can't help but mention how great heath ledger was. he may be drop-dead gorgeous, but he can also act. he didn't disappoint me ""not even a little bit, not even at all."""
2,HEATH IS QUITE THE CUTIE!!,"This movie was so bad. A bad adaptation, if you could call it that, of a shakespeare movie that the tv show, Moonlighting, did better in their adaptation. Julia STiles was very angry..as she is in everything i see her in..my two stars are for the australian hunk, heath. he is so cute, and has a devishily handsome smile... i would like to see more of him and less of the shakespeare ripoffs."
2,Shakespeare is always cool...,"This movie is as lame and predictable as many teen films. Julia Stiles' acting is stale --although as usual there's no denying her screen presence, the dialogue sounds like it was written between takes and the rest of the cast are cardboard cut outs of high school stereotypes. I'm not knocking teen films because I happen to like teen films even though I probably outgrew them long ago but this one is pretty bad.However, this movie has a few saving graces. First of all it's a modern version of Taming of the Shrew. And, it name-drops a few literary giants along the way (due to Kat's unquenchable thirst for literature!). Also, Allison Janney is priceless as a guidance counseler/wannabe romance writer. And, the rantings of Bianca and Kat's father about teen pregnancy are very funny. Finally, the firey Heath Ledger as high school bad boy makes the last half of the film bearable. I'd throw in an extra half star for these things alone."
5,It's like so totally great,"This movie is surprisingly good! I figured it was just going to be another boring love story focused on the teen audience. But actually this modernized adaptation of Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew"" is very entertaining. When I watched this movie my mind was set that it wasn't any good, but I was wrong, this movie is an excellent retelling of a good, yet old, Shakespearian play."
5,10 THINGS I LOVE ABOUT THIS MOVIE,"This is one of my favorite movies right now along with Never Been Kissed and Clueless. It's a funny, and sorta romantic movie about a new high school student, Cameron, who right away falls for Bianca, a girl who everyone knows is not allowed to date, until now, her older sister, the anti social undateable, but pretty Kat does. Cameron tries desperatly to find a date for kat, he finally pays a strage mysterious guy to date her. This is Very funny and Very good! It stars Larissa Oleynic, Julia Stiles, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Heath Ledger."
3,"Love the movie, DVD is not too impressive","The movie is a cute, funny teen movie with a great cast. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes movies like She's All That, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, etc.I don't know if it's worth the extra money to buy the DVD. It has very few extras.All in all, the movie is great, the DVD is so-so."
3,shakespearean teen,"After nearly ten years directing TV shows and pilots, this was Gil Junger's first shot at a feature film. Not bad. Because it was based off a Shakespearean play, it doesn't seem as contrived as most recent teen genre movies -- but don't let that fool you. It still manages to be contrived, but in a fun way. This film does what it's supposed to do -- entertain young people. I mean, what do you expect out of it -- Shakespear?"
4,fun movie to watch,"i guess you all know the story, so i'll just writemy opinion about this one. as for me, i like comedy-romance sort of movies, and this one is near perfect! it's funny. (there were parts me and my sister just lough our guts off!) and very cute, nice young acters, and a nice story. if you have my kind of taste, you'll love it! the only flaw, but it's in all of these ""comedy-romance"" movies, is that it is too ""predicted"", you can just guess the end! (just ruined it for you, didn't i? sorry..) so as i said before, it's a very fun, cute and wite movie to watch!"
4,A good teen movie!!,"Though most of the teen movies out there are bad (loser, she's all that, I know what you did last summer), ten things I hate about stands as out as a well written well thought out movie that will please teens as well those who are not teens. This is movie is actually a decent romantic movie like high fidelity and keeping the faith. I liked to see a group of young actos playing this modern day adaptation of taming the schrew."
4,Taming the shrew :),"Excellent movie. Funny , love story. Filmed here in Tacoma and it wasn't raining , Imagine that ! Julia & Heath were fantastic."
3,"Above Average ""teen"" Flick","Well I went to this movie not sure what I'd be seeing, but it was actually pretty good, this is probably due to the fact that it was based on Shakespere rather than written from scratch. As such it is pretty much required to have more depth of character and plot than your average ""teen"" flick.To be honest, what I liked best was that it was filmed at Stadium High School (which passes for Padua High in the movie) in Tacoma WA near where I live and the shots of the school etc are great (it looks like a castle).But I digress, I do recommend this movie and NOT just for teen girls, but for anyone who's looking for a basically light-hearted story of love and betrayal and more."
4,Better than DVD but not that drastic,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie. This purchase was part of my replace my ""dead technology"" favorite DVDs with blu rays. As much as I love this movie I would say don't scramble to get it on blu unless like me its under the $10 mark. The video quality is very noisy, blue skies look like they're swarming with bees. The behind the scenes extra is worth the previously mentioned price of admission though for sure."
3,definately a teen movie,"I remember when my friends talked about wanting to see this movie.. they all wanted to see Andrew Keegan because they think is the a cutie.. And don't get me wrong, because he is a cutie lol, but all I thought was that this movie would be a cheesy teen flick. When we saw the movie, I liked it.. I'm not saying it wasn't cheesy, because it does have it moments.. but i realy thought it was intresting how Sheaksphere's The Taming of the Shrew was ""updated"" for many teen today.. it was intresting to see a new verion of Sheaksphere's work."
5,This movie is amazing !!!,"I saw it with my best friend and we bothed loved it. The whole cast did a fantastic job. I thought the cast was so cool, and it's a very superb movie."
5,Favorite Movie of All Time!,"10 Things I Hate About You may seem like your typical, cliched teen flick. Well, it's not! The storyline, dialogue, and actors are great in this movie of the now-updated, ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" written by Shakespeare. Meet your average, high school sisters. Katarina Stratford(Julia Stiles), a boy-hating outspoken outcast who looks at a glass half-empty instead of half-full. Her younger sister however is the cheerful popular Bianca(Larisa Oleynik). Unfortunately, for the guys that vy for her eye, Bianca can't date unless her ""shrew-type"" sister dates first. So, a new student named Cameron(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and pretty boy Joey(Andrew Keegan) set Kat up with the perfect match(Heath Ledger) so they can date Bianca. What's the outcome? Find out in the best movie, 10 Things I Hate About You!"
2,oh so predictable.....,"i dont really think that it is a bad movie, its just that it is sooooo predictable! not only that, but it doesn't stick to well to the taming of the shrew, which is a classic!"
2,Not that great.,"This wasn't a completely bad movie, but it's not a film I'd want to see again. It had a funny moment or two, but it was really just run-of-mill and not that interesting. The acting was fine; it's just that it seems like there's so many films out there just like this. Not a complete disappointment, but once was enough. I'd give 10 Things I Hate About You 2.5 stars."
2,Potential squandered,"So, after much hesitation, I finally saw this film. I get that this takes Taming of the Shrew and makes into a modern day coming-of-age story. That was a reasonable premise. However, you take this talented cast and fabulous director and waste them on just another mediocre coming-of-age tale where the characters are so under-developed that you really don't care whether they come of age on not. Add to that a forced over-sexed twist to try to be hip and the result is huge loss of opportunity. There are moments, but overall, a stark disappointment when contrasted with the potential from source material and the talent on this film. I might be kinder if the source material weren't so great or the talent so strong. Really could have been bright dialog and clever interaction."
5,movie,"this movie was a gift for my son, he saw it in school and wanted it for christmas and he really liked it."
3,"Not a bad adaptation, as adaptations go","10 Things I Hate About You lived up to the generally good reviews I heard of it last year. A cast of relative unknowns, a well-established plot (The Taming of the Shrew), and the general young-and-beautiful feel-good-ness all come together to make this at least an enjoyable experience, if not a brilliant one. Soundtrack could have used a bit of tweaking, and I'd have given anything to go to a high school that looked half that cool. *** 1/2"
3,1.Reason I didnt have a subject:I lost it?,"This movie would best be viewed if you do not really haveanything to do and you have a friend over on a Saturday night.For someof the people that hink this movie is qoute-on-quote ""Uproarious"" and ""Incredibly Funny"" they might of saw another movie.And it being the best movie of '99,Was this the only movie you saw?But please do not get me wrong!I am not trying to come off demeaning the people you made this film,it is a fairly well made adaption of Shakespear's work.And I am also sorry to the people that might of thought I was demeaning them too on here.This is a good film,if you really think you might want to see it by all means,see it,do not listen to me!You will most likely enjoy it as I.Have a good day......Ryan END"
2,10 things,"In comparison to then The Play The Taming of the Shrew, this movie failed to capture the true emotions of Kate, Bianca,and Pertuchio. The movie is portrayed as a love story with Patrick making Kate fall in love with him with his charm. But this is no where near the attitude of Pertruchio in The Taming of the Shrew, where he treats Kate very poorly in order to ""tame"" her from the way she has always been. He makes her fast and not sleep for an extended period of time by ""killing her with kindness"". However, the movie had a nice incorporation of Shakespeare Line throughout the movie and it was any enjoyable movie for the ordinary high school love story romance."
3,"If you are bored, then watch it.","This movie was blah. It looked funnier on the trailer. I was disappointed in it, but then again, it was your typical teeny bopper movie. Why do I bother. The new kid in school, Cameron, likes this popular girl, Bianca, and wants to date her. She likes this other popular guy, Joey. Bianca can't date him until her sister, Cat, gets a date...a rule of their father. So Cameron and his buddy tell Joey to pay this other guy Patrick, to take out Cat. Meanwhile Cameron doesn't know Joey is taking out Bianaca. Is this a mess or what? This is a twisted soap opera for teens."
5,My Favorite Movie Ever!!!!!!!,"Omigosh this movie is so great! Julia Stiles(me and my best friend's fave actress) was very convincing as a modern ""shrew"". She gave a brilliant performance that was admirable. Everyone should go see this as soon as they can. It's a classic that you won't want to miss!"
5,This movie is the best...,This is the best movie ever. It is very very funny. All the characters are very sarcastic and the plot is very twisted and surprising. This movie is a great romantic comedy and I would recommend this movie to people of all ages.
1,This movie was really awful,Anyone who likes this must have the IQ of a little kid. No one in this could act and the plot was just super weak dude
1,Dumbed down Shakespeare,"This adaptation of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew, set in a Seattle High School, leaves Shakespeare's play almost entirely behind. Only one line from the play is cited in the entire video. Instead of a story about a rough man ""taming"" a woman in need of sex, we get in 10 Things a sappy story about a teen boy ""saving"" a ""feminazi"" young woman. If you are looking for a serious revision of Shakespeare's play, ignore this film. For more on ""Shakesploitation"" flicks like this one (including Never Been Kissed, an adaptation of As You like It, see my book _Unspeakable ShaXXXspeares_."
1,10 Things I hated about this movie,"10) The plot was a very Poor translation of ""Taming of a shrew"" 9) The plot was juvenile 8) The plot was boring 7) The plot was completely predictable 6) The romantic lead character was a poor imitation of Jim Morrison 5) The soundtrack was trite 4) There was no actual romantic chemistry 3) I kept having to slap myself to stay awake 2) even my wife hated this movie (and she usually loves ""chick-flicks"") 1) This movie makes a mockery out of Shakespeare's work, it is an embarrassment"
1,tHERE ARE MORE THAN 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT THIS MOVIE,How original a poplular good looking guy is forced to hook up with an unpopular girl as a foavor or bet. Gag!Didnt they make like half a dozen movies like that last year.This probably was the worst with bad acting and some of the worst dialogue since... well since a long time
4,Teen Movie and Shakespeare?,Who would have thought that you could combine a teen movie with parts of a Shakespeare play? I'll be honest I've never been a fan of teen movies but for some reason I really enjoyed this one. The way this film combined both the seriousness and the unpredictability of high school relationships was great. In addition the casting and the cinematography was fantastic.
4,Good Comparison,"I think that if you are thinking of reading the taming of the shrew, that it is a good idea to watch the movie as well. While there are some differences between the book and the movie, you get the general similarities and are able to understand the book a little better, as there are several characters to follow. In my opinion while watching the movie it seems that Patrick is the one who is tamed, while in the book Katharina is clearly the one tamed. Overall, I thought it was a good movie to watch if you want to understand the book a little better."
4,Reveiw of 10 Things I Hate About You,"This movie was a great reference for students trying to understand Shakespeare's play, The Taming of the Shrew. However, there were some differences between the two. Probably the main differences revolve around the Kat and Patrick's relation ship. In the movie Patrick treats Kat very well the whole time. He tames her by being nice to her. In the play Petruchio tames her by giving her a dose of her own medicine. The movie really helps you figure out what is going on in the play. It helps to give you a sense of who all of the characters are. I would recommend watching this movie before and after you read the play. That way you will have a feel for the characters and when you are done with the play you can compare and contrast."
4,It kept me laughing!,"This remake of Shakespeare's play keeps alive the the flavor of the orignal play. I've always enjoyed Shakespeare's comedies, and this remake doesn't disappoint. The puns and banter of the characters are fresh and entertaining. At times, some of the actors show their inexperience (this is particularly true of Heath Ledger). Julia Stiles does a superb job of playing the shrew. In fact, she steals the show. My other favorite character is Ms. Perky, the sex-obsessed guidance counselor. After you've had one of those days when nothing seems to go right, pop this movie in the DVD player and get ready to laugh!"
4,Great Movie,"This is a great movie, even if you don't like the teen genre film. In this update of Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew"", Patrick is paid to take Kat on date, so Cameron can take her sister out. The problem is that Kat finds out, after Patrick has fallen in love with her. This is full of comedy and romance, and a must see for anyone who loves a good laugh."
5,90's teen drama at its best,"I saw this movie when i was about 12 and from that moment on i loved it. It doesnt take itself too seriously, the light pg-13 humor really reveals that.""So mr verona you exposed yourself to the lunch lady?""""I didnt expose myself it was a bratwurst.""""Quite the optimist arent we?""Its dialog like this that really pushes the movie. It keeps you laughing but also you can relate with the characters. The soundtrack is great and overall of of my favorite movies ever."
5,Destin To Be A Classic,Heath Ledger's first film and it's superb! This is bay far one of the best chick flick comedies I've ever seen. I owned the DVD before I bought the blu-ray. There's really not much more for extras but does look great in 1080P. (:
3,funny and witty,"Joseph Gordon Levitt(HalloweenH2), Tv's 3rd Rock From The Sun) is in love with Julia Stiles little sister, Julia Stiles(A Guy Thing, The Bourne Identity2002) and her sister cant date or do anything unless their father, a very hilarious Larry Miller(Best In Show, Carnival Of Souls), says so. so Levitt meets David Krumholtz(The Mexican, Santa Clause 1 and 2) and he tells him about this rebel kid, played perfectly by Heath Ledger(The Order, The Patriot), so Levitt makes a deal with Ledger and Ledger puts the charm on Stiles and Levitt puts his charm on Stiles' sister. witty and funny with good performances by the young hot cast. other cast members include Andrew Keegan(O, Camp Nowhere), Alyson Jenney(Tv's The West Wing), Gabrielle Union(Bring It On, Deliver Us From Eva) and Daryl ""Chill"" Mitchell(Tv's ED and Sgt. Bilko). a good time"
5,HELLA GOOD!!!!!!!!!,"THIS MOVIE QUALIFIES AS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES ON THE MARKET FOR TEENAGERS, ADULTS, AND EVEN KIDS. THE STORY LINE IS AWESOME, THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANYBODYS DVD COLLECTION."
3,pretty good for a chick flick,well the first time i saw it i was tricked into it.i hated it the first time i saw it. however the second time i saw it i found it to be not all that bad. the acting is so so basically just a bunch of seventeen magazine people are in it. i wouldnt buy it its only rentable quality.
5,the coolest ever,When I watched this film I wasn't expecting it to be too brilliant. but I absoloutely loved it. it was hilarious and heath ledger was great. the acting was really good. and the great thing about it was the teenage characters were played by real teenagers. Kat and Biancas dad was really funny
5,Hysterical,"This is a wonderful, funny movie. The cast is fantasic as well as the story line. The dialog was also great because it is soooo funny. You'll be laughing hard at this one. Some parts were a little unbelieveable (like the school. It looked like a college) but hey, that's movie business. I am a big fan of both Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger and I thought they were fantastic in this movie. Overall, its romanitc but way more funny."
5,Portraying assertive females in a positive light,"This is one of the 3 movies that I own. I NEVER buy movies, but this one was def. worth it. A great example that females do NOT have to submissive and feeble and that standing up for your self is a positive thing. Oh, and the soundtrack rocks, too."
4,Surpringly funny and well-acted teen comedy,"Of all the teen comedies that came out in 1999 (and there were many), this is easily the best written and acted. Taking its main plot from Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew,"" the storyline is nothing new. Neither does it have anything truly remarkable to say about the plight of teenagers at the end of the century. But then, not all movies have to have a message. Passing on entertainment value alone, which this one does winningly, can often be enough.The cast is very likable, from the leads through several of the supporting players (comedian Larry Miller gives a splendidly dry performance), and the script is funny enough to keep one's attention throughout.It's no ""Fasttimes At Ridgemont High,"" or even ""Clueless,"" but then, it doesn't make itself out to be. It's a fun film with a storyline that's lasted from Elizabethean times."
5,Great film. One Favorite!,"I love this movie! The acting is great and so is the music! It is about young Bianca (Oleynik), the most popular girl in school. Every guy wants to date her, including the most popular guy in school (Keegan), and a sweet new exchange student (Levitt). Only one problem. Bianca isn't allowed to date due to a family rule which is that she can't date unless her sister, Kat (Stiles), does. She's the most unpopular seinor in the school. So, in attempt to go to the prom with Bianca, Mr. Sweet Student decides to fix Kat up with someone simalar to her, a crazy guy (Ledger). It is so funny! This film stars Larisa Oleynik, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger, Andrew Keegan, and Gabrielle Union."
4,Great film!,"This is an interesting modernized adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"" with a great cast. I like how they incorporate all of the characters [with their original names for the most part] in a high school setting, and the dynamics of the cast. The English teacher also mentions Shakespearean sonnets in class, tying in the story's roots. Comical, romantic, funny."
4,"Hip, funny, in control.","Without being too over-the-top or annoyingly dramatic, 10 Things I Hate About You is a witty, harmless, inventive teen film that did and continues to do more than She's All That or Drive Me Crazy could've wished. The film is refreshing, even if it doesn't have the newest story of the century. It does the Shakespearean thang with hip sensibility and creative script-writing. Julia Stiles and Heath Ledger who play Kat and Patrick are an awesome team, they comedically portray a teens version of romance with style and interest. I loved the scripting and the film doesn't go grey with age too quickly."
5,Not just a Teen Movie,"There I was stuck on MEDEVAC standby for a week with 3 sub-25 year olds and only one Television. I envisioned early mornings so that I could watch the news and then they would take over the TV around noon for Games and Teeny-Bopper and T&A movies.The youngest of them rented ""10 Things I Hate About You"" and popped it in while I was in the kitchen cooking. Since the kitchen overlooks the TV I started watching and became engrossed. The dry humor, the literacy, the plot. It has been said that there are only 50 really good original stories out there and that all others are just variations on each of them. Well, this is the best variation of Taming of the Shrew that I've ever seen. None of the Bard's work has been so well modernized or updated with the possible exception of West Side Story but that is far from modern now.When I returned from the week I rented it and shared it with my approaching 40 wife. She, sappy movie lover that she is, loved it also."
5,Great Movie!,"This is a great movie. A very modern, teen-based Taming of the Shrew. With a hot cast including Julia Stiles, Heath Ledger and Larissa Oleynik, this movie is great. It's smart, hip, and funny, and sets a new standard for all teen movies to come! A true modern classic, with great school, party and dance scenes."
3,Above Average Teen Comedy!,"This is a surprisingly smart and funny teenage comedy. The two leads can really act, a rare thing in recent teen comedies. Also smartly written with witty and entertaining dialogue. The story is surprisingly derivative of Shakespeare, but is set to high-school life and they manage to pull it off. While not a great film, it's funny, smart, entertaining and features good performances. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 6!"
4,Comedy with taste,"This was an excellent movie. It exhibited humor,reasonable taste, and a value structure that teenage parents would like. The only criticism I had was that some of the secondary characters should have been given more time to develop. Some very impressive acting. Larisa Oleynik was unfairly criticized."
4,julia julia,"as in the 60s show, julia stiles carried the torch, leading the way for the rest of the cast to follow! the sexiest scene is when kat (stiles) is dancing on top of the piano.. she is truly magical....."
3,SHRUG.,"1) Not bad. 2) Not as simpleminded as a Jennifer Love Huey Duey flick. 3) Cute 3rd Rock From The Sun casting. 4) Julia Stiles is very hot. 5) ""Seinfeld's"" evil-doorman was pretty funny as the dad. 6) Julia Stiles has a nice voice. 7) Some parts were unrealistic-the detention scene and the I LOVE YOU BABY rendition. 8) Julia Stiles has nice hair. 9) For a teen-flick it was no FAST TIMES or PORKY's, but it will kill 100 minutes of your life without too much regret. 10) Julia Stiles is cool."
4,Great little date movie,"Total teenie chick flick movie, but as a guy I found it surprisingly very fun to watch. This one proudly goes in my DVD collection and is definitely a must watch."
5,Awesome!,"This movie is one of my favorites. I'm 12 years old, but I've watched it with my friends, parents, and my little brothers. Every person I watched it with found it hilarious. It was very well written! It was so funny, and I want to buy the video as soon as it comes out! Even if you're not much for romance, I'd have to say that you'd STILL like this movie with it's comedy and even the story. I hope you found this helpful! Bye!"
3,"Great movie, LOUSY audio in the DVD","I love this movie. Don't get me wrong. But the audio in the DVD is terribly mixed. I actually turned the thing off after watching 10 minutes of it.On standard equipment, it's probably okay; but if you've got a surround-sound deck or a decent amp, this DVD will sound awful.Really too bad. It is such a fun movie."
4,Cat the Cursed,"This film was much better than I'd expected. A re-telling of Taming of the Shrew that transfers well to the modern day high school.Good fun throughout, the two leads are very likeable as Patrick takes on the paid task of 'wooing' Cat to enable another school chum to go out with her sister. Cat's poem to Patrick at the end is brilliant - you just know that each time she's saying 'hate' she really means 'love'.Put it in your vcr, cuddle up with your partner and enjoy."
5,Loved it!,I absolutly loved this movie! I watched it really late on a Saturday night then when I woke up the next morning to watch it again. I would have watched it a few more times but we had to take it back! The characters were great and I can't wait till I can buy it!
1,Stick with the original maker,"I bought this re-conditioned ink cartridge because it was cheaper than buying a new one from Dell. Big mistake! I was very pleased at how fast I received it from the seller but after only two uses, the cartridge stopped working. Never again. From now on I stick to buying new cartridges."
5,The Best Resource on the Gaff Rig,"Leather's book is probably the best resource on the Gaff Rig that I have seen yet. Great text, clear illustrations, and quite a bit of information not found elsewhere makes this my favorite of the books I've reviewed. While Leather is a Brit, he does have quite a bit of info on American gaffers as well, including a chapter on the fishing schooners of New England. Each major component of the gaff rig is treated with a chapter (Mast and Spars, Running Rigging, Standing Rigging, etc.) and then adaptations for several specific types of boats (catboats, sloops, cutters, smacks, yawls, schooners, etc.)"
3,Not disapointed.,"I want the book to design a small boat rig. Only two chapters out of ten are usefull for me.Otherwise, very nice coffetable book."
5,The Gaff Rig Handbook,"Converting my Swampscott Dory from sprit rig to gaff rig. This book is the""Bible"" for gaff rig history and explicet diagrams. I have sailed on many gaff rig schooners but unless I video thier rig under sailing conditions I would not remember all the ropes. I suggest to go along with this, Tom Cunliffe's HAND, REEF AND STEER"
4,Good Movie,"I found this to be a funny and yet strange movie. Danny Devito and Arnold Schwarzenegger have good comedic chemistry.The strange part is the science fiction idea of a pregnant man. Yet the characters bring good humor to the plot makingit believable. I thought it was a good movie. I, personally, like their movie: 'Twins' better, and this should have beenthe sequel to 'Twins.' None-the-less it is worth seeing."
4,Peace under the Golden Gate,"What a strange silly film. 1994 was not a great year I guess for Hollywood and for Schwarzenegger. Apart from being absurd, the humor there may have been between some of the frames and shots has disappeared. The film still survives as some kind of entertaining slow motion mental disposal animated and agitated void and empty discourse on the taste of the cosmic wind on the other side of the moon. But if you want to taste the slightly nostalgic vision of San Francisco and its cable cars be my guest and enjoy the trip.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"
2,Good intentions but...,"A prestigious scientist (Scharwzenegger) is embraced by artificial insemination testing by himself a new pharmacological device.In spite of the existence of several funny humor blows, it predominates along the picture coarse humor, signed by a permissive and excessively didactic vision of the sex. To be true, there is a potent allegation respect the familiar institution and the motherhood virtue. The fact is that a good chance was wasted about regain the magic of those classic comedies directed by Wilder or Hawks.But anyway, let' s make an imagination exercise; Mel Brooks directing, with a six hands script written by Robin Williams, Billy Cristal and Danny de Vito would have been a major successful premise.But all comparisons sound hateful, perhaps. Don `t you?"
3,Are you sure it's not an insult for pregant women ?,"Junior is a great casting film but the storyline is awful ! I love Danny Devito I have seen most of his movies ,but in my opinon this movie is a insult for pregant women that is .It shows kids cross dressing and sexual harrassment ,a pregant man is a insult I mean just think of that was a real fertily drug they would be selling like crazy ! This movie is ok but is a insult ? You be the judge ."
4,"Funny and Almost Believable, One and a half thumbs up!","Junior is a great film for ages 10 and up. An intresting Family Film. Its almost believable that Arnold is pregnent, but not quite. Arnold's too masqulin. Emma is (as always) terrific, 5 stars for her!!!"
3,Goofy,Just plain goofy! I have watched this before and had forgotten parts. At least it doesn't have Arnold shooting up the baby clinic!
3,This movie helps to be more considerate with women.,"Excellent plot and of course three great performers. The way that the Director developed it, it was just perfect. Good reproduction!"
3,Light-Hearted & Funny,"I wasn't disappointed when watching this movie because it was just as I'd hoped it would be, cute, funny and fun to watch over and over. When I need a pick-me-up, this movie puts a smile on my face every time."
4,"A good, fun movie!!","I saw this movie for the first time this weekend. And I have to admitt, I really didnt expect that much out of it. But I was pleasantly suprised. This film is one of those films that are perfect to sit back and watch on a Saturday afternoon. It may not be academy award winning material, but its a true feel good film. After seeing it, you want to see it again! If your one of those people who watch a film just for the simple reason of picking it apart and trying to find ways not to enjoy it, you need to get a life. Just watch it for what it is, a fun movie.For all you expecting mothers out there, you will absolutly love this movie. It basically has a man (Arnold) going through every stage of pregnancy. Ever wished a man could know what its like to carry a child? Nows your chance! The only thing I didnt like about the movie was the pro choice line , ""My body My choice."" Other than that, its a definate must see."
1,danmanbz,"terrible item these are spring chicken, don't buy this item,the old use shocks i took are were better than these, i do not even know if these are Monroe's because there is no label on the shocks that said so, am about to take them off and put on some old ones this is to tell you how terrible they are. DO NOT BUY these people spend more and get better shocks. unfortunately i cannot send them back because i live in Central America (Belize)"
3,"Great Commentary and Funny, Terrible Editing","I really enjoyed the insightful and often very humorous commentary given in this book. It is below my level as I'm a film industry professional, but I wanted to check it out because I'm directing my first feature and thought it would be interesting and probably entertaining. I mainly was hoping for funny stories, which is what I got! My problem with the book is there quite literally at least 200 errors in this book, if not 300 to 400. I am not exaggerating. One page alone has THREE misuses of ""then"" instead of ""than"" and there are constant typos as well. There was clearly no editor whatsoever, which is astonishing for a book with a real publisher. It's totally inexcusable. As a two-time author myself who did all of his own editing for grammar or spelling errors, I proof read my books until I found 0 mistakes. It's the author's job not just to write the book but to make sure of its quality, and that was not done here."
2,overrated,"I like the fact that this movie was done on such a limited budget, but it literally put me to sleep. Robert Rodriguez is just alright..."
4,"Mexico 's version of Mad Max , Mariachi style","I felt i had to buy this , due to the fact I love the sucessors that followed , and in spite of the fact I do not speak or understand a word of Spanish , but I took a chance anyways. Although I do not think this is as good as the other Mariachi films, I was suprisingly impressed with this very low budget film that that launched off the career of Mr. Rodriquez. It was not hard to follow and was entertaining,and it does remind me of Mad Max (even though it is very little) , but the simularaties are that both films started with low budget first's and then succeeded with two fantasic Sequels that followed. So I will say this is one Spanish film worthy of my collection."
4,What A Film!,"An outstanding movie. It really goes to show that you don't need big budgets and Hollywood Studios to make a film that is so interesting and packed full of action.A great storyline of mistaken identity that forces the development of the El Mariachi's character just to survive.The level of action and stunts go far beyond the $7,000 budget.It is films like this one that encourage young independant film makers, like myself, to develop their skills and ambition.This film is a definate must for any one who enjoys watching really good movies.On the other hand, if you prefer films that stick to Hollywoods idealistic views and mindless emotions, maybe you should get out more."
2,$7K movie and it shows,"First of all. I love ""Desperado"" and ""Once a Upon ..."" films. I bought El Mariachi on the assumption that the film was up to the par with the sequels. It's not. The quality of this film reminds me when my small town's local theater would show cheap mexican movies where the acting and editing were poor even to the untrained eyes.Film students just love this film because it was made on $7K budget. It is an amazing film for such a low amount but it's not a great film for the average moviegoer. Mr. Rodriguez shows promise in this film and he has fulfilled them in the sequels but the accolades from 4-star reviews are misleading."
1,Why have you dopes put this movie in the Spain Categorgy?,Why have you dopes put this movie in the Spain Categorgy?Why have you dopes put this movie in the Spain Categorgy?Why have you dopes put this movie in the Spain Categorgy?Why have you dopes put this movie in the Spain Categorgy?Why have you dopes put this movie in the Spain Categorgy?
2,Not as good as I expected,"This is one of the very few cases where I believe that the sequel beats the hell out of the original. Desperado has a main character who speakes English, a REALLY hot girl, and a ending that doesn't leave you waiting for a sequel. I reccomend Desperado over this in a second."
5,finished the sereis,It filled in the blanks that I wanted of the series. The dvd had no flaws and was great.Really enjoyed whatiching the hole thing again from start to finish
5,A REAL TRESURE!,"This movie by Robert Rodrigez is my favorite of the trilogy. People seem to have a problem with the cheap ""Sundance"" feel of the movie, but I really love how this movie was pulled off with low buget. I garantee that if you view the ""Ten Minute Film School"" featurette (comes with the movie) that you will have alot more fun watching the movie knowing how it was made, and knowing the little tricks Robert Rodrigez used to make the action so real and just for pennies. Great movie, great plot, and great use of little money. Oh and you'll just have to get over the fact that it's subtitled for English, it's worth every second!"
4,The old Sundance classic still holds its own,"Until you watch the ""10-Minute Film School"" featurette that shows you how REALLY low-budget this film is, the actual movie itself won't give you that much of an indication of how little it cost. This action-packed film is well-shot, clever, paced well, and altogether entertaining-- and even at times moving. Give ""El Mariachi"" a whirl."
3,Why didn't the guy just change clothes?,I enjoyed Desperato and From Dusk Till Dawn and a guy at school suggested this movie to me. Well....I get it is low budget and done in one shot....but it seemed very repetitive. The mariachi keeps getting chased because he carries a guitar case and wears black pants with white shirt...he even becomes aware of the mistaken identity and still doesn't do much to prevent it. He knows they are looking for a guy with a guitar case wearing black and white....so why oh why did't he just change into some jeans and a t-shirt and leave the case behind for a day or so.....oh cause if he did that then there would be no movie since this is a shoot 'em up type movie.The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because I did think the ending was cute. Loved the dog on the motorcycle bit.
4,"Fun, brisk action film","The Bottom Line:A scrappy little action film made for 250,000 that completely works and rarely betrays its low-budget origins, El Mariachi is not only loads better than the far more expensive Desperado but is a legitimately enjoyable film which could scarcely be much better.3/4"
4,"If you&#65533;ve seen Desperado, you&#65533;ve only seen the second part!","Originally shot on video tape, this movie is one of Robert Rodriguez's triumphs as a director/editor! The story begins with a simple Mariachi looking for work but quickly escalades into far more. Prisoners escaping, drug smuggling and guns firing, the young Mariachi finds himself surrounded by henchmen via mistaken identity. Wonderful editing but poor sound; it is however a must have for those who enjoyed the Desperado film."
5,Great homeschooling Map Book,"I am impressed with this book. First of all, it has great color, and quality pages. The content is excellent and starts out describing what a map is. The lessons teach map keys, symbols, compass rose (N,E,S,W) and has the student reinforce directional routes, and much more. I used this for an almost 4 y.o and he learned so much. I wish there was a sequel to this book. Great price too."
5,Bunco Babes Hit the Jackpot,"At last! The perfect gift for your next Bunco get-together. I laughed at the lives of the Bunco-playing women of Morgan Estates, mostly because their lives are much like the lives of my Bunco buddies. This book covers all the essential topics covered every month when we catch up on each other's lives--kids, husbands, sex, sex toys and affairs (well, some bunco groups are racier than others)!There are no other Bunco books that can compare! Share it with your fellow bunco-ites."
5,Awesome,"What a great, fun and enjoyable book to read. It's so nice to read a book like this once in a while. There were a couple of times I laughed so hard I cried. This truly is a book about ""the other side of us Moms""."
2,The Jury,"A disapointing read. Story starts out slow and continues slow and doesn't get good until almost the end of the book. Not one of his best. ""The List"" would have to be his best to date."
3,"Fantastic Trek, Just Like an Episode","Having just finished the tedious Next Gen novel Ghost Ship, Perry's Planet was just what the doctor ordered. The Bantam novels in general were much more simple, streamlined affairs than the Pocket novels to follow. No space wasted on character interaction or inner monologues - just a bare-bones story (pun not intended).Perry's Planet is almost magic in the way it evokes the original series. The novel sounds and feels uncannily like an episode. The plot, like so many of the original series episodes, is a recycled hodge-podge from other episodes, including a Landru-esque society and computer program, and a pacifying virus akin to the spores from ""This Side of Paradise."" A Klingon death vow starts the novel off with a bang but otherwise does not live up to its promise. Wonderfully concise, Perry's Planet provides a couple of hours worth of mindless, enjoyable entertainment."
2,Trent's Credit Mobilier Is a Lightweight,Short and sweet. Only 71 pages. Submitted as Masters thesis. Could have used more development. What there is isn't bad.
1,Run do not look back,"I made the mistake of buying several of these things because they looked like a good idea. It did not take long and all the lamps were dead, but before that happened I had to repair them. The plastic fittings used to hold the shaft in place do not and I used a hose clamp around the outer segment to hold it in place. These things are wobbly, parts do not fit tightly like the tripod, and out of four units they were all the same. I ended up drilling holes in the shafts for 1/4"" cap screws with wing nuts to hold them and replaced all the halogen lamps. Now that everything is tight I will use them till they completely fall apart and find another big green Power Light I've had for years that works great."
1,Poor quality,My set of these lamps burned out in under 10 hours of use per bulb. The stand is very poorly constructed and one of the handles broke off from a cheap weld. I would not recommend these.
4,Cooper/Regent TQS1000 Twin Work Light 1000-Watt and Stand,"Great price & simple for me to put together/use as soon as it arrived. The stand seems somewhat wobbly when extended to its full height, but that's easy to deal with by adjusting its twin lights up or down without adjusting the stand to its max."
4,Lots of light!,"This product was purchased to put in our basement after my husband ripped out the electrical, wallboard, etc. in a huge remodel. It has worked great. It provides TONS of light, is almost hot to work around. The bulbs did burn out quickly and had to be replaced. The bulbs were inexpensive and found at the hardware store. The stand is a bit wobbly, but is fine if you are careful."
2,not bad,"I've had this product for over a year. The lights worked great for occasional use, but are VERY HOT, producing a lot of heat, but also a lot of light. Sadly, they both stopped working at the same time. Replacing bulbs didn't solve the problem. Obviously, poor quality/wiring. Useless now..."
1,Exploded on third use....beware.,Third time I used it one of the lamps EXPLODED. I was waxing my car in the garage at the time and it sent glass all over the car and garage floor. Just glad I wasn't standing in front of it when it happened. This thing is down right dangerous. Buyer beware.
1,Not even worth investigating,"This is VERY cheaply built. Definately not made to last. Nuts and Bolts don't stay tight. Fell apart in no time. Can't seem to locate any that are made with substantial materials like those that could be found, two years ago. Not a good buy, even if you are trying to save money. At some point, you get what you pay for. 500 watt bulbs are VERY hot and Expensive to operate. Try to find a lamp with 300 and 500 watt bulbs"
3,Elves fight back,"I tend to agree with the School Library Journal's review that storyline is somewhat lacking, especially for the targeted audience of 7-10 year-old readers. But my 4-year old daughter absolutely loves this book, she has us read it to her over and over again. Perhaps the proof is in the pudding -- a wonderful, fantastic tale for a younger audience. Your pre-schooler will love this book, and so I recommend it accordingly."
5,prnter,overall this was a great experience. hassle free. it took a little longer to recv than other items but it was well wrapped and all parts were there. thanks
5,This is an awesome printer!,This printer is great. So small and compact. I got it to fit into my tiny computer armoire and takes up very little space. It prints super fast and does a great job.
4,My opinion,"Ok with the item, but it did not have the battery. What was not said clearly in the description of the product.Anyway, thanks."
5,office on the road,"great little printer,prints really fast even with the wireless card.however be carefull when you order generic cartridges blk or color.they come from someones home ink brew from the bathtub.they work but the encrypton on the cartridge will detect as a fraud copycat cartridge,they work but don't print as clear.hp cartridges are very good especially vivera,but are very expensive.Also when installing the wireless card contact hp desk help do not i repeat do not try on your own,only try if you have 36 hours straight to install."
5,awesome,"A plug and play printer(don't need the installation Cd with Vista and Vista doesn't seem to recognize the CD anyway) with Vista. Didn't have to calibrate the printer. Gives you printing options like 'quick print' for less ink use, faster prints- handy feature.Been using this priner for a month with no problems."
2,Expect Setup Problems,"I read the reviews on this product as to the difficulty of wireless setup. It is not a simple procedure and I have yet to get mine working (I have not spent enough time with it I suppose).USB wired, it works great! If you are purchasing for the convienience of wireless use, expect to spend a lengthy amount of time with setup."
1,useless paper feeder,"I had high hopes for this attractive and portable printer, especially given HP's good reputation. But I was intensely disappointed when, after installing it on both a Dell and an Imac, with one single successful ""test page"" printout, it refused to work on either. Everytime I hit ""print"", the printer went wild: spitting out every piece of paper I fed it, without making a single mark on any of the paper. Impossible to correct. And then it turned out it was no longer under warranty and not returnable. A complete waste."
1,Quit working after printing three pages successfully,"Confusing light display (looking in the manual) told me there was a paper jam after printing three pages. There is no jam. There is nothing stuck in the printer. Sending it back now. I do not have time to troubleshoot a new printer that fails to work properly after three pages. (Maybe you won't have time either!) I am very tech savvy and have checked the manual. The device simply is defective.I also noted that the top lid that folds down for packing to travel seems very flimsy. It's hard to imagine it would not break in time, and since it's the paper feeder, you'd be out of luck. I'd recommend something else."
3,Easy music for easy dancing,"This music is very easy to dance to: beautiful, well made, traditional belly dance music for a stage - but this is nothing spectacular, just nice..."
1,"Technically Correct, Emotionally Bankrupt","All the legal information in this book is spot on. That's all I can say that is positive about this book. The sections on emotional processing and grief, I felt, were directly damaging to the reader. The essence, I felt, was ""get up and walk it off"". I've not seen a book written by social workers that was this emotionally dishonest in years! What little information there was about the emotional and personal ramifications of an adoption plan were notintegrated into a fully human understanding.The ""section"" on birthfathers was positively insulting! A scant paragraph remarking that they usually aren't there and may or may not experience many of the same emotions as the birth mother was all the effort the authors put in. Combined with language and syntax choices that were generally mildly to moderately sexist (against men) this book made me feel angrier, more ashamed and more powerless than before I had read it!Best used as kindling."
2,The Third Choice,"Birthmothers get over their grief in a year? Get real!! It's too bad these two authors (who just happen to be social workers) didn't get it right! That part of the book is very misleading for those contemplating adoption; it takes us back to the Dark Ages (i.e. most of the last century) when birthmothers were told they would get over it. (Most didn't!) For another slant on adoption, I suggest the book written by Merry Bloch Jones. Also the book by Gediman and Brown. A biography on this subject is Search for Paul David."
4,Hard-to-find deal,"Been looking for this one for quite a while and had to grab it at this price. Excellent early compilation of a sadly underrated and unknown band, once you hear them you'll want to find more. Great service from seller, quick and good condition. Glad I got it."
4,Great for beginners; useless for anyone else.,"If you are new not only to Foxpro but also to relational databases in general, this is the book for you. It spends a great deal of time on the basics of tables, relations, and queries, but only a few paragraphs on forms and macros. A cursory mention is made about the programming language itself"
4,Great for the non-accountant!!!,"I bought this book for my first managerial accounting class and it is a great resource. A handy reference for basic concepts, it really helps you see the general principles quickly and effectively."
3,A great book but needs update.,"This is with no doubt a great book. However, it has not been updated for 8 years. While carrying it everyday, I found its usefullness weaning. I tried to call the publisher to query the plan of a new edition, but got only an answering maching and no reply was offered for 2 mo now. Well it is still a good book but not for up-to-date clinicians any more."
4,Bakerman's ABCs,"A good reference book, especially when you know specifically what you are looking for. Don't expect to see a description about basic general things, like a CBC."
4,"campy, creepy, classic","wow....this one has it all. just when you want to laugh at the acting, the atmosphere makes your skin crawl. a little slow at times, but a movie you'll not soon forget. not everyone will ""get it,"" but if you're a fan of the cult classic horror movie, you'll definitely enjoy this!"
5,Terrific Film,Its Amazing that low budget films like this one can endure the test of time. I truly loved the eerie organ music and don't care what anybody says about it. Those people don't have good taste that discredit the music. You have to be a truly dark arts fans to enjoy it. The plot of the film was pure Aghori. The sect in India that claims we are all dead even though we think we are not. We are the Carnival of Souls!
4,A Creepy Classic!!!,"This is a very good creepy movie. It has a classic look to it. A woman named Mary Henry survives a car accident, and after that, she starts seeing a deformed, ghoulish figure,(who directed the movie) Sometimes, it seems like she is dead to the world because she can't hear and no one else can see or hear her. There is one part where we think she is talking to a psychiatrist about what's been happening to her, the doctor's chair turns around and it's really that ghoulish man. Later, she ends up at an abandoned carnival and the ghouls try to take her. I like the colorized version of the film because it makes it better and creepier and realistic! If you love classic horror, you'll love CARNIVAL OF SOULS!!!"
4,haunting,"A somewhat amateurish production,but very moving in many ways. I have a feeling that some of our present day directors have seen this film and borrowed from it. For movie buffs only."
3,Who wrote the box?,"A little reminiscent of Ghost Story, this film shows us the tale of a young organist who seems to be the sole survivor of a car crashing into the river. Her life continues as if torn between this world and the one beyond.This is where the box is misleading. When I watched the movie, I waited for zombies to come after her. I think I better description would be ghosts since the beings are not material in any way and only she can see them. Since this is an older movie, the special effects are minimal. However, the filmmaker did well with what he had.Because it is an older movie, the cast seems to really be projecting their voices to ensure they are heard. This gives the movie the feel of being just a movie. At no time will you feel like your are part of the action.But the film is not bad. If you are a fan of old horror films, then this would be an interesting film. This is a story you can tell around a campfire. For the average viewer, you may want to give this a skip."
1,TERRIBLE VHS TREATMENT OF CLASSIC FILM!!!,This is one of the worst quality videos I have ever seen. The image is so awful I felt like I was watching a bootleg tape of this classic motion picture. The sound is also terrible. I own the Criterion DVD and comparing this version of the film to that one is like comparing the Mona Lisa to road kill. Do yourself a favor and go buy a DVD player just to be able to watch the Criterion version!!!
1,AVOID THIS RELEASE!,"The Criterion 2-disc edition is far superior in image and sound quality to this release and, most importantly, is the only one endorsed by the surviving creators. You can receive thoughtful and in-depth information on the film with that release, something Mike Nelson's comedic commentary could never provide. Plus you get the two original versions of the film, neither of which are colorized."
1,Totally Disappointed,This movie was a complete piece of JUNK!!! It was just like a bootleg. Very Choppy! Unclear! JUNK!
4,Great classic cult spook story,"Sorry, there are no fountains of puss and vomit here. No brain spewage or severed limbs. No copious amounts of blood or gore in this one either, but this movie still packs a quite a fright.It quickly grabs your attention when a car plunges off a bridge into a river. There is one lone survivor that emerges from the water, apparently unscathed. She has no recollection of the accident.As the story progresses you are left wondering about her. Hallucinations and nightmares begin to manifest, sometimes this woman seems disconnected from reality.Now you'll probably see the ending coming, it's been done countless times by todays horror. But I'm sure it was quite a shock back then.For this low low price, this is a must own if you're a fan of classic horror. I don't know if I'd splurge for the Criterion though, but it might be worth it..."
4,Carnival of Souls,"A ghost is a soul which doesn't realize it is dead, and that is what Mary Henry is in Carnival of Souls. When she sees that she is invisible to others, Mary realizes that she's ""not in this world."" The creepy organ music is like something you hear in a silent horror movie,and the camera angles and b&w photography add to the eerie atmosphere of the film. It's a psychological horror film with sexual overtones,like Psycho, and a precursor to Night of the Living Dead. A true classic,not to be missed."
1,crap,"It sounds cheap. It looks cheap. There was nothing scary or entertaining about it. The plot doesn't make sense. People talk to her, everything blurs then they don't see or hear her. Dumb. I had to force myself and my friends to watch it. I love old horror films but this one was a dud. I don't understand the reviews saying how great this movie is. Don't waste your money."
4,Creepy and corny,"The 1962 version of the movie is creepy and corny as only it was done in the 1950's and early 1960's.A fun scary movie for Halloween! A classic ""B"" style movie.I loved ""Saltair"" which featured prominently in the movie as the Carnival and former dance hall.They don't make places like that anymore and that is a real horror.Perfect for Halloween."
3,Good black & white movie for the bucks,"I bought this DVD on a whim, and I'm pleased.It reminds me a little of Night of the Living Dead and The Tingler. The transfer from film could have been cleaner. The DVD still has all the ""dirt & damaged film look"" left in. In a way this adds to the character of the movie. The sound is in mono, and the DVD had no information inside (like a chapter list). No extra features other than chapter search here either. Can't complain, pretty good movie, cheap price, over an hour of entertainment. You can't rent for what it cost to buy this one."
3,Carnival Of Souls,"This movie was filmed in Lawrence, Kansas, (a college town full of acting students), in 1961. It was directed by Herk Harvey, who made 400 educational and industrial films for Centron Productions in Lawrence. This was his only feature film. StarringCandace Hilligoss (Mary Henry) and Frances Fiest (Mrs. Thomas). Herk Harvey plays the main ghoul that Mary Henry keeps seeing. She survives a drag race in a rural Kansas town and then leaves to be a church organist in Salt Lake City. She is haunted by a ghoul (Herk Harvey), and he connects her to a deserted pavillion next to the Great Salt Lake called Saltair. It's great! But it's a little hokey in a phew scenes."
2,Horrible Movie,"It's horrible and does not keep my interest. It's creepy in a very odd, boring way. I didn't like it at all."
4,Creepy low budget film,"I saw this film as a kid and recently saw it again. It really holds up. The scene on the bridge sent shivers down my spine and all the carnival stuff holds up well. The musical score by Gene Moore is sufficiently eerie to keep the mood creepy. All praise goes onto Candace Hilligoss who plays Mary Henry in a very intense performance, that is both eerie and surreal. She really makes the film work. The directing by Herk Harvey is very good for a B movie. This movie goes on a little long but it is still worth seeing."
5,Features commentary track by MST3K's Mike Nelson,"This colorized version of the 1962 classic features a hilarious commentary track by ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" star Michael J. Nelson.By the way, the company has been offering a ""Mike Nelson Autographed Preview Edition"" and just lowered the price to $12.95. However, the Autographed Edition will only be available until the March 29th retail release date, then they're gone for good, so order 'em soon if you want 'em. They are available only through their website at http://www.offcolorfilms.com/cos.html"
3,"Great movie, bad tape.","I have watched this movie several times over the years and consider it to be very well done for a ""B"" movie. Because it was filmed in b/w the mood was made eery without having to use a lot of special effects. In fact several parts are VERY eery. The only thing that kept me from rating it 4 or 5 was the terrible quality of the tape. The first time I saw it I rented it and was rewarded with a flawless tape. When I bought the tape I was rewarded with junk. The picture completely disappears for seconds at a time and jumps and jitters almost continually. My suggestion would be to skip the tape and go for a DVD."
5,A GOOD THING TO KNOW BEFORE BUYING!,"DIAMOND has currently produced a DVD of this film, coupled with another good flick, HORROR HOTEL. The picture-sound quality of this release was absolutely superb,and it was a mere 7 dollars. You might want to check it out!"
1,Another insult from Legend,"Anybody who has ever seen this film needs no warning to stay as far away from this DVD as possible. It is a moody horror classic that induces nightmares as few other films can do, but much of that comes from the truly creepy black & white photography. Colorizing it would absolutely ruin it, but Legend is a company that specializes in ruining B&W public domain films by colorizing them, as if we're too stupid to enjoy a film with its original cinematography. There are wonderful versions of Carnival of Souls out there - it's good enough that you should seek them out, particularly the wonderful Criterion Collection DVD. But this one? Garbage."
2,Carnival of Souls,"I don't get what the hype is about. Being low budget is not an excuse for bad filming, Night Of The Living Dead was low budget and that's superb. Carnival of Souls on the otherhand is poorly edited, scripted and dreadfully acted. I felt no fear AT ALL. It does not deserve a cult like status.There are much better horror movies out there. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Living Dead Girl?,"It 's Halloween night. Scary movie fest at my house. This one came highly recommended, the guy behind the counter at the video store said it ""disturbed him for days"". After watching this, I think he'd probably say that about the Muppet Movie as well.Why do people hold up examples of cheap desperation such as Carnival of Souls as Art? With all of Herk's experience as an educational film maker, you would think he had learned something about technique. This is the sloppiest movie I've seen since Plan 9 From Outer Space!!I tried really hard to get into this one. And I must admit that the main actress chick had a hauntingly wierd kind of a face that almost worked, if only she didn't have dialougue!!!I REALLY tried. But the waves of laughter from the audiece just put the last nail in the coffin.Sorry. This one's a [dud]."
2,Not for me,"I was looking for more flexibility in the knife. I thought it should give more than it did. I would not recommend it if you have another choice. The price is good, but not if you have to purchase another one to do the job you thought this one would do. Save your pennies and get the knife that's right for you...and the job you have to do with the knife."
3,"Quality has diminshed, price is still the same !","The tang is slightly larger than the handle and can be felt sticking out a little on both sides of the handle. The copper rivets also are slightly above the handle, and can be felt. Poor attention to detail when finishing or maybe they have skipped that finishing step.Otherwise good balance, cuts well, both as expected from Chicago Cutlery."
2,Had to discard,"Bought it - loved it, left in the sink one time overnight by accident and it rusted out about 1/32 of an inch of the blade edge. I would normally not leave a blade in the sink overnight. But with some of the knives I have owned for 30 plus years - it is bound to happen sooner or later - and it does.I have never seen one of my knives when left in the sink rust, except a couple of cheap ones purchased over the years. But I would have expected that. This was unexpected to be sure because of the brand name.Had to discard. Maybe it was just defective, or just my fault.If you buy this knife, treat it like you would a knife you might buy at a food store and never leave it in the sink touching other metallic objects for any extended time more than an hour or so would be my suggestion."
5,Amazon Women On The Moon [DVD],This is very funny; I had been searching for it after seeing it years ago on TV. I couldn't remember its name. Glad I did it's a collectors item if you like quirky sketches well filmed.
4,Still a cult classic,"A bit aged, but still a cult classic. A little better than Kentucky Fried Movie."
5,This movie is funnier than anything else I have ever seen!,"This movie has something for everyone: nudity, violence, bad luck and aerounautics. It's simply hilarious."
4,hilarious,"AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON is a clever series of comedy skits, designed to resemble channel-surfing on late-night cable access television. As the title suggests the main feature is a B-movie schlocker called 'Amazon Women on the Moon' (supposedly presented ""complete and uncut with no commercial interruptions"") but constantly halted for technical glitches, commercials and community service announcements (the actual film being parodied is a combination of two different sci-fi classics of the 50's, ""Cat Women of the Moon"" and ""Queen of Outer Space""). Most of the sketches are fantastic and the stars include Lou Jacobi, Erica Yohn, Michelle Pfeiffer, Steve Guttenberg, Rosanna Arquette, Griffin Dunne and Steve Forrest. Highlights: Ed Begley Jr. as the ""Son of the Invisible Man"" and Carrie Fisher in a hilarious parody of a 1930s sex education film."
1,Started great then went down the drain,The first skit with Arsenio Hall was pretty funny but then the movie went to crap. I didnt laugh at any of the other stuff. Looks like they put the funniest segment first. What a waste of talent on bad corny writing
4,Never gets old,"A classic cult comedy film ... the film is done as a series of connected shorts with a lot of subtle connections between the pieces. It has an all-star collection of comedic talent (similiar to ""It's a Wild, Wild World). There are some very cute bits from the roast at the funeral to the suggestion that the Loch Ness monster was actually Jack the Ripper!One caution, this is not necessarily a kiddie movie -- they won't get some of the jokes, and some of the film is inappropriate for the younger gang."
3,Solid 80s comedy - Better than 80s SNL,"Very soild comedy. It starts off with some really unfunny bits but finally finds a great rhythm about 15 minutes. Alot of the sketches are just tedious and have too few good jokes. But the strength of this movie is its running jokes and UNBELIEVABLE cast. Its a who's who of great 80s cult actors: David Alan Grier, Rip Taylor, Michelle Pfeiffer, Ed Begley Jr, Henry Silva, Joe Pantiliano, Kelly Preston, Arsenio Hall, TK Carter, Griffin Dunne, Steve Guttenberg, Rosanna Arquette. And all of them do well in their parts as mostly young comic actors. This film is a follow-up to Landis and Weiss' ""Kentucky Fried Movie"", but is far superior. Its precursor has aged horribly and isn't as funny to a modern audience. This film has some dry moments, but you'll enjoy the ride."
3,"Not bad, Not Great","Okay so I got this because it was kind of like the sequel to Kentucky Fried Movie which I absolutely love. You can certainly tell that this title is fitting because like so many ""sequels"" it doesn't live up to the previous attempt. However, it does serve up some laughs, albeit uncomfortable ones at times. For instance I enjoyed the funeral/roast about half way through the movie. And the centerpiece movie, ""Amazon Women on the Moon"" was pretty amusing. It was like so many old cereals, cheesy special effects and models, over-the-top acting, all shot in what looks like Arizona desert with the sun shining so they didn't even try to cover that up which I thought was funny. So as far as sketch movies go this one was amusing but if you are looking for something that will leave you laughing even after its over like Kentucky Fried Movie, you'll probably be disappointed."
3,Unrelated is the key word,"This series of unrelated skits is a hit and miss proposition. There is 10 minutes of laughter, 75 minutes of waiting for another chance to laugh.There are nudies, and Nessies, roaming up your Arsenio Halls. Lana Clarkson as Alpha Beta got my gamma globulin. Ed Begley Jr. was such a good actor that you for got the script were not complete or amusing. And Michelle Pfeiffer was almost enough to keep you from taking a break. The sound track would be more amusing.Watching ""Cat Women of the Moon"" (1953) is more satisfying.Cat-Women of the Moon"
5,AWOTM Rocks.,This movie is way funny. The humor is a rather stupid humor that kept me laughing throughout the movie. It's really worth watching. !
4,Great comedy in the tradition of Monty Python,"Not what I would call the greatest comedy that I have ever seen, but definitley one that you should not pass up. The first time I saw it, I had no idea what it was about until I caught on that the joke was exactly that. The entire movie is about seemingly meaningless, and odd occurences that are falling down halarious. Part of the humor can also be seen in how low the budget of this movie had to be. It will forever live on in the tradition of the ninteen eighties, but its humor will be timeless. Two of the movies funniest scenes can be desribed as follows: Young tenage boy, nervous about buying condoms gets award for one milionth customer-------An early Arsenio Hall comes home and goes through an incredibly funny series of bad experiences"
3,It has its moments,"""Amazon Women on the Moon"" is like watching someone else flip through the channels late at night. It does have some pretty hilarious scenes but just as much as there are these funny moments, there are some boring ones. I wouldn't totally recommend it unless you're just curious to watch it. Not a bad movie to watch late one night if you're bored."
3,DVD is the perfect format for this movie!,"DVD is the perfect format for this movie! About half of this movie is hysterical. The other half is, well, pathetic. The DVD format allows you to skip the lame skits simply by skipping to the next chapter. Say you don't find the Steve Guttenberg / Rosanna Arquette scene particularly funny (I'd have to agree with you), skip it! Granted, this cuts the total running time down from 85 minutes to about 30, but what's left is well worth the price of admission.The three stars I gave this movie are an average. The parts of this movie that hit are five star funny! The parts that don't work barely earn one star. So if you buy this movie, you'd be best to keep your DVD player's remote control handy."
3,Hit and Miss,"The film has a handful of hilarious sketches, but a lot which miss altogether or which are mildly amusing and go on too long. The array of famous names which appear in this is baffling.The DVD is disappointing, being in full screen format with no extras to speak of."
3,Velvet sure isn't her mother. But she's got spunk too.,"I was kind of disappointed with the first part of the book, and like other readers, I really, REALLY disliked Alex a great deal. I felt absolutely no incentive to cheer him on to win Velvet back - if anything, staying with Akbar would have been the smart thing to do! What I cannot understand is Skye O'Malley, of all people, knows better than to take any bull from a man, so why would she let her daughter marry a bully? (To be fair, though, she did express hesitation - but still!) This is just the beginning of weak characterization on Small's part, and it just gets worse later into the series."
4,great read,"The story was done very well. It was the fourth in the O'Malley series and one of the best. Velvet is beautiful, but a very self-centered brat at the beginning of the story. Her parents have gone sailing away when Velvet's betrothed comes down from Scotland to claim her as his property.This doesn't go so well when Velvet inlists herself as one of the Queen's maids of honor. She eventually falls in love with Alex and agrees to marry him before her parents return. All seems well, until Velvet gets captured and sent to an Indian harem. All she can do is survive love lost, love found, and love lost again.. I loved it!!"
4,"Not as great as ""Skye,"" but still a good read.","Velvet is not as magnificent as her mother, although she does have her own adventures. I would recommend this book as part of the series, but it might be a little hard for it to stand on its own."
3,Doesn't compare to The Kadin. But not totally bad.,"Personally I prefered The Grande Mughal to Velvet's final husband, Alex.This book wasn't terrible but it could have been better. I do have to admit I loved the characters. And I loved what Ms. Small did with them. When Akbar sent her home, it was heartbreaking. And the part about him aging so quiclkly once she left showed how much she'd influenced his life like nothing else could. After that things went down hill. Some of Velvet's behavior was just ridiculous and made me mad.The woman who'd won Akbar's heart disappeared and a child stood in her place."
1,Terrible,This book is horrible and biased. I found this to be an ignorant book written by an ignorant person.
3,How to enlarge your ego...,"Greek singers aren't generally humble to begin with, but releasing a double album and having it become one of the biggest selling CDs of all time won't help matters any.In any case, this was was the biggest album of '98 and maybe deservedly so. The production values are second to none, and there are a lot of great songs (""Paparouna"", ""Xaramata"", ""H Stella H Smyrnia"") but unfortunately, there's just way too much filler for this to be considered a classic.If you want a more balanced effort from Sfakianakis, check out ""Pempto Vima"" (5th Step), which is a single disc, and is chock full of classics."
5,Hollywood Joe for Lance Loud....,"Lance Loud...wow where do I begin...?....I first met Lance in New York City when we were both teenagers....so I can say I knew him when...Lance was a great man.. agood guy that was a very loving person....He was, as his name is,LOUD at times....but mainly I recall the real kind hearted boy / man in his soul...I can see him walking down the streets and avenues in New York City with that unashamed flambouyant gait of his which was at many times looked on as a weakness....but in fact Lance was a man in complete command....he got things done....he went for it ....many years...I should say decades...before the phrase ""GO FOR IT""...was ever coined or mentioned.... THAT is what Lance Loud was all about.... AND DO NOT YOU EVER FORGET IT...!...A boy....later a man... and always just a guy with dreams like everyone of us .... But most of all I will remember him as a man who kept the peace....in a time of turbulance.... HAIL,HAIL LANCE LOUD...HOLLYWOOD JOE (NYC and LA)"
3,Not a production tool,"Clever tool for one-offs and a little custom work, but if you make more than a few drawers at a time, this tool is way too labor intensive. The jig has to be moved and set at least three times for each pin / tail cut and each move is an opportunity to mis-align a cut or get a chip under the jig and ruin the piece. Very flexible once you figure out how to set it up, but it is not a production tool"
2,Not all it can be.,"The ChestMate offered here can make dovetail joints. I was disappointed that the jig offered by Amazon does not come all the attachments ChestMate offers. Check the internet and you can find the updated ChestMate that also does box joints, dowel joints and mortise joints."
3,NOT THAT GOOD,"Not that good, It was made in Atlantic City and not in Pittsburn where the other doo wap dvds were made. After viewing the others I am sorry I purchased this one."
2,audio,"I ordered a number of dvd's that are great,this one title Doo Wop has terrible audio,i turned my volume up as far as possible and still could not hear the music and the singer good enough to enjoy them,i am very displeased with this product,love the artist just very bad audio,which is a dis-service to them and me,the customer."
3,Not the best Doo Wop concert by Lubinsky,"This Doo Wop concert was performed at The Sands Casino in Atlantic City and is more a night club performance than a theater performance. The groups that performed live did a great job and would have been even better in the Benedum Center For the Performing Arts in Pittsburg. There are a number of ""flashback"" films included here that did not seem to add that much to the presentation.Overall, not one of Lubinsky's better efforts, due to the concert location and over-production in the editing room.A better choice is Rock, Rhythm and Doo Wop. Also produced by Lubinsky."
2,Partial Episodes,This video only has partial episodes not the full episodes. Maybe if I could see what was going on I could have followed it better but they jumped from one partial episode to the next without any breaks. Very confusing and disappointing.
3,TV Classic _ Adventures of Topper,"I enjoyed watching the old TV topper series. There were, however, a couple episodes that could not be viewed due to some type of error in the recording."
2,A big HMM,"For $3.99, one can't complain. The video is good but the audio is truly terrible. Why on earth would Platinum disc brag between episodes that they produced this? I would think they would hide their logo."
4,The Adventures of Topper,This was always a fun series for me as a young person. Topper was so prim and proper and that starchiness was always tested by the invisible friends he had. I enjoy watching this again after so many years.
2,Disappointing DVD,"I was very disappointed after seeing ""The Adventures of Topper."" Just did not have the magic of the original Topper film with Cary Grant, Constance Bennett, and Roland Young or Topper Returns with Roland Young and Joan Blondell."
1,sound lost,In a little over 1 year time the sound went out on this 37 inch lcd tv...called customer service and after 3 resets per their instructions gave up....poor performance from this tv....asked a lcd repair person and they advised a 600-700 dollars repair estimate...
1,Not Worth the Money,"As soon as the Limited Warranty ran out the TV Sound went out. No Authorized Protron Service Center Location in our geographic territory that would cover this Protron PLTV-32CM Television. Just went out an got a new Sharp TV. Should not had to replace this one, did not last a Year.Yes, I a little upset."
5,Thank god I found this!,"I had the two LP's (Un Poco Loco and Sensacion) years ago, and they were long gone (to say nothing of my turntable). I despaired of finding them again, and here they are in a set! What can I say, except it's an indispensable part of my collection. The other two I like are El Rey and Mambo Diablo, which with this set make a pretty complete Tito collection."
3,Not so good for the car,While on the highway when only the guitar is playing I have to turn up the volume to hear the music. Then suddenly the entire orchestra joins in and the windows rattle from the blast of sound. I could not find a volume level that worked for this disk. The music was lovely but the sound engineering was disappointing.
4,"Very good tale, a little biased","This book worth the time and the money expended on it. M. Coignet was there, fought and lived to writte his tale. Excellent for anyone interested in the Napoleonic Wars. Besides it is a primary source for a lot of other works on this subject.The author gives the soldier point of view, a battle is reduced to smoke, cries, fear and sweat. It is a very different thing them showed in the more usual historic approach. Superb.The only problem is that M. Coignet, in his own words, is to perfect, everybody liked and helped him. Ok, he entered the dreaded Guard, but one can't satisfy everybody everytime. Otherwise a great book."
4,FROM HUMBLEST ORIGINS TO NAPOLEON'S OLD GUARD,"This book offered an honest and sober account of a man, who rose from very humble origins, overcame illiteracy, and distinguished himself so much as a soldier of long service in Napoleon's Grande Armée that by the time he was retired from the military in 1816, he had risen to the rank of Captain."
2,Mile wide & inch deep survey,"Reads more like it was cribbed from Wikipedia, since most of the text is a recital of the events of WW2. Decent overview, but not much technical detail. Loses a star in the rating for referring to the commander of the 6th Army at Stalingrad as a ""von""."
4,"Very entertaining, fast moving!","Before I was midway into The Champion, I went online and ordered The Warrior. Delighted to find a new author!!!"
4,Exceptional Plot--too Many Annoying Characters,"This is a very clever, well plotted novel set in the perfect time period of medieval England. At this time, belief in the supernatural is a deadly risk, women are bought and sold in the marriage trade for flat-out amounts of gold and family ties--as well as careful and politically cultivated ties to the royal court--matters of life and death. SO with such a lot of great writing going on--what's the problem? For my taste, there are at least two characters, who while absolutely needing to make their presence a key plot point, are just annoying as heck. Basically, these necessary characters ruined this story for me, although the author has earned an auto-buy on her next work."
5,A Keeper,"Whether you are planning a baby or a wedding shower this book is, as the title says, THE COMPLETE GUIDE. Especially wonderful are the menus and recipes for such themed parties as: A Victorian Tea; A Sumptuous Luncheon, A Festive Brunch. Everything you need for hosting and planning is in this book. Keep this book on hand for all future occasions."
3,Very unique,"I've never read a book written by a community before. It makes for very interesting reading. Of course, some stories are better than others, but the overall experience is excellent."
3,fruit of the loom boxer briefs,i for the most part buy another brand but i tried the fruit of the loom brand this time. i don't like them as well as the other brand. i don't like the seam that runs down the middle of both legs and i should have bought one size smaller than i normaly wear.
4,Beginning/Intermediate Tennis lessons 2 Video set,"Very good the information discussed was right-on, the fact it was broken down into two sets of six lesson on a tape helped a lot.Some of the sound could could have been better on the beginner tape, but the info was just what my wife needed,to get started. I really liked the intermediate tape, it help me understand that rising/ball half volley shot. I'm also glad you solved that sound problem from the beginner tape. I was having trouble with deep shots that landed by the baseline, and this rising ball shot really helped."
1,Poor method for teaching,"This video is very poorly. It don't has a good method for transmit the information. It's is low graphicall. I bought other videos as Tennis on my Way (Arthur Ashe, Vic Braden Excellent). Tom Avery (Excellent) and If I compare this video with these there are a great diference. I think a lost my money."
3,the girls where nice looking!,Well it starts off in the living room and the girls talk about how they saduce there man and the go back into the bed room to chane into there lingerie and come out and show all its about 57 min. long not long enough and i found that it wasnt enough!
3,Good coverage,"First off it doesn't last ten days. I use my hands constantly and 2-3 days is the limit for me, but considering the other stuff lasts one day, I consider it a bargain. I didn't notice a smell but did notice it dries quickly."
5,a must-have for titanic buffs and non-buffs,"Susan Wels' brilliant volume TITANIC Legacy of the World's Greatest Ocean Liner must rate among the top ten books on this renowned ship. What does set it apart from most other books is the wealth of high-quality photographs of artefacts salvaged from the wreck site. These objects were painstakingly restored to their almost original pristine conditions -- and viewing them makes the whole drama come alive. A shoe brush, a steward's jacket, a jar of olives -- all amazingly intact after more than 80 years on the ocean floor. The story of the ship's ill-fated maiden voyage will be old hat to most Titanic enthusiasts and so will the photographs of the ship and the wreck be. But there are some amazing illustrations of the ship's interior that are a credit to the artist. If you're a Titanic fanatic like me, this is a must. If you're only mildly interested in that Great Ship, get it anyway -- it's worth every cent!"
4,"absolutely beautiful book, threads past and present, a must for those interested in the Titanic","For me, the greatest story of the Titanic was the true story. I'm not really one for nonfiction, and yet this story just fascinates me (and so many others) unbelievably. Anyway, this book is beautifully and poeticly written, full of amazing pictures and history. Best of all, it is incredibly up to date with a wealth of new findings and information about the wreck. Grade: A-"
4,First Time Puzzler,"At 1000 pieces this puzzle is a great way to start anyone's interest in jigsaw puzzles. The pieces are sturdy and detailed. When completed, it is gorgeous and frame-worthy. This puzzle took about 10 hours to put together and it has it's challenges. No frustration trying to put the sky and sea together. Overall, it was a great experience putting the together."
2,Very poor quality of sound.,"This SACD is not a product of authentic SACD using DSD recording devise. Theresultant sound quality is not of that of true SACD. The most eminent is thepoor dynamic range. I does not recommend this 'fake' SACD, and genarally warn SACD's that does not guarantee DSD technique at recording sessions* bacause non-authentic SACD making is always at danger of poor sound quality.* Analog tapes as original source is OK. They can be readily converted to DSD source, thereby producing the highest quality of SACD."
5,Confessions of a Sneaky Organic Cook,"Raising 3 children who became sick one right after another, someone handed me this book and our lives were never the same! God bless the author!!! She opened our world up to health!! Now I'm ordering copies so that my grandchildren will be healthy.There is one change I would make, the meats of today are not the same as those in the '70's. USE ONLY ORGANIC MEATS!!!"
1,NOT London Blue Topaz By Picture,"If the color of this stone is just as pictured on the web, this is NOT a London Blue Topaz, which is a much deeper color and has more value than that of other topaz colors."
4,Works but takes alot of battery power,"I liked it, but if you are using a laptop and you are focused on portability LOOK For A POWER OUTLET, this product has moving parts and sucks allot of power."
2,Didn't Live Up To It's Reputation,"I have read some great reviews about this drive. It is also rugged and durable, so it seemed like an easy decision for me. I too, had the problem where it would not work as a bus-powered drive, unless I used both USB ports. It was a shame. I swapped it out for a SmartDisk FireLite drive and couldn't be happier..."
4,Wow,"Story of the Year puts on a show like no other band I've ever seen. The concert footage alone is worth the price.Not only to you get the DVD of their concert, but a CD of the show for your car stereo. As well as behind the scenes footage on the DVD, which is hilarious. Rock needs more guys like this.It's a must have for any Story of the Year fan, and a great buy for anyone who hasn't seen them perform."
5,Brilliant!!!,"I have been listening to this group for a long time. First time i watched this DVD I loved it, They make the crowd get into most of their songs...You want a rock group with lots of energy..this one for you... But my favourite is the bonus features, it has:Music Videos (5.1 Audio) Sidewalks, Athem of my dying day, Until the day I Die,...AOL Sessions, And the making of the Sidewalks video.Also a Documentary of the groups life in BASSASSINS. Dont forget the Live Concert (DVD) & the Concert on CD AudioThis is Value for your money!!!!!I recommend this to any Story of the Year fan to get this CD/DVD combo"
3,Best Live Show?,"Ok, like it's been said, this is NOT the best live band in the world. The acrobatics they pull out on stage are entertaining, no doubt about it.HOWEVER, it is a cardinal sin in rock music to PUT DOWN YOUR GUITAR SO YOU CAN DO A BACKHANDSPRING ACROSS STAGE! You are a musician, not an acrobat. If you can do all this stuff while playing or during a break in the song, go for it. Otherwise, play your damned instrument.Another thing....having a set group of moves to do during a show reeks of choreography...whatever happened to the spontaneous rocking out jumps?For a five star live dvd/disc, pick up Coheed and Cambria's ""Live at the Starland Ballroom"". Much better than this, which is average at best."
3,OK,"I Feel bad for kids who say this is the best live act out there because you're too young to realize all the other great live acts out there. This band is sub-par at best. Yeah I bought this CD but come on dude, they are not the best live band out there and I don't need to go to their show to say that. I'm sure the band itself would laugh at that statement. I've been to a lot of shows over the years. My first real concert was R.E.M. in 1995 so lets not go overboard here people. Their a decent band that can play their music. I was impressed with their AOL accoustic set because they can actually play, but they are not life changers here with their average music and some catchiness."
1,Did not work for me,Sorry for me. This product did not work. It actually made my condition worse. I was encouraged by the reviews so felt secure in purchasing this product. Buyer beware.
2,was ok...,We ended up not using this product after all. We got it for excema but it burned when applied so it wasn't used again. It'll probably make a good regular moisturer for something else. Maybe I'll use it after a pedicure.
2,These aren't Throughbreds!,This makes me so mad. All these new authors are coming and changing the series. Nothings the same anymore and the plots are repeditive. Don't even bother reading these books until #32 these are like a different series. I don't know excactly what's happing but these new authors suck!
1,better then the last,this book was better then the previous christina books-but it was still sorta bad. Christina acts as if her horse doesn't matter-just as long as she gets attention. She could care less bout Sterling.
1,This is Campbell?,"Ugh! I can't believe this book is written by Joanna Campbell! It stinks! Come on now, this is the worst, most predictable plot ever! I thought that now Campbell is writing them again, they would be good but no! They are even worse! Thoroughbred is turning into a deranged version of the Saddle Club! Aaahhh!"
1,Could have been way better,I just read this book and thought it stunk. Eliza's secret turns out to but really stupid and I thought that the book was pointless. Christina spent most of the time feeling sorry for herself because everyone else was having fun. Ever since the first book I have only seen her as a snot!
1,Horrible,"This is REALLY STUPID! I mean, why does idiot Christina go to a high level trainig camp with her WONDER HORSE(not) Sterling, when she's been off the track for about three moths. You shoulden't even THINK about entering a horse that green in any sort of show. The books never really tell about Christina teaching Sterling to learn to jump cross-country or do dressage. After #24, in Melanie's Treasure, Sterling is jumping and doing dresage ect. And I think that Christina's Courage should be called Melanie, Kevin and Dylan's Coureage, because they have to put up with that ***** Christina. And now for this book, Christina acts like such a baby when she is put in the begginers group. She shouldn't even be allowed to ride at all! Another Disapointed Reader"
3,I liked this book- SOME:(,"Yes, I ride Hunter/Jumper and I like to read about jumping. But why did Joanna Campbell give up this series- only to start ANOTHER ONE that was similar to the early Thoroughbred books? WHAT'S THE POINT?"
3,okay,"oh, this book makes me long for horses. every horse series in the world has no officially had the horse summer camp book, but it was entertaining to read about chris and mel's adventures. every time chris gets taken down a notch, i'm happy too.it's a shame the series will be ending soon. i'd love to see it continue."
2,Where did racing go?,"I have already reviewed this book, but I'd like again & point out a few things. first of all, Joanna did not write this book! though it was a sort of good book, Joanna's are far better. second, I'm sick of jumping. these books are racing books & thats why i love them and so many others do. I'm glad that racing is slowly coming back, but so should the horses & characters. I have read almost everybook & know the old characters as if they were real. Just please, writers, bring back racing, Glory, Cindy, Sierra, Samantha, Tor, Mandy, Wonder, and so many others."
5,I loved it!,I loved Camp Saddlebrook! I don't know why everybody dosn't like the new writers. I know they will never be Joanna Campell but I think they are pretty darn good. The only thing I don't like is whatever happened to Cindy and Samantha? I heared that Samantha lives in New Zealand with Tor. But when did she move? Why did she move? Did Cindy just fall off a cliff? I think if the authors would answer those questions the seires would be able to go on.
1,It's hard to say,"I mean, I respect the authors. They're all talented writers and most certainly better than I am, that without a doubt. I like jumping and all that in moderation, but for that I have my Saddle Club books, and I love them. But the reason I read the Thoroughbred series is because of the racing and excitement. Thats what it's about.Its just not the same when you skip a decade and introduce a new storyline. I'm glad that Joanna Campbell is back, and that she had nothing to do about the books about Christina. I can't wait until the books and Super Editions by her come out."
4,Not bad at all,"Christina is too much of a spoiled brat in my opinion, but I liked this book. I was on the edge of my seat when Christina found flash."
5,Summer Camp Fun,"Camp Saddlebrook, by Joanna Cambell, is about Christina Resse and her horse, Sterling's Dream. She is very excited but a girl called Eliza dosn't like her and she has no idea why.I really liked this book and think that Joanna Cambell writes this whole series well and own some myself.Once your in 3rd or 4th grade it will probly br easy enough to read and understand. I hope you like it as much as I did."
2,"Okay, but this book was a little bit stupid!","Camp Saddlebrook was pretty stupid, but I can't really say anything about characters because it's the second Thoroughbred book I've read. But this is why it's so stupid. Eliza's secret was stupid and why didn't she just tell Christina or Melanie or someone? They would help her! She just had to hold it in until the last second! And how would Flash get colick? Plus, one second they were at Saddlebrook Farm and the next second they were at the High School watching fireworks!!!!"
5,A Classic,"This Cd is one of the best Cd's, A lot of the songs date back to the early days of the band and for all the die hard Raw Power Fans, this Cd has 35 songs plus an interview. This Cd also sounds a lot diffrent from their later stuff, but this is one anyone should go out and buy."
4,A family game,"Our seven year old daughter is getting the hang of this game, the scoring takes a little time to get used to, but it makes for a fun 2-4 player game. The rules are simpler and the game-play is less competitive than for theOriginal Carcassonne - (Big Box Set), (for example - there is no stealing of cities or land). The concept is easily learnt and a fun addition to a games night, but plays quite differently from the original games.My only gripe is that I still can't work out how the tiles are meant to fit in the box during play - am I missing something?"
1,Not recommended. About 30% Frontpage and 70% other stuff,"This book would still be poor value if you removed the 70% that is little to do with FrontPage as such and reduced the price to 30%. Anyone who needs the sort of basic Windows/web information with which this is cluttered should buy something else and get some familiarity with the interface before starting on constructing a website. The HTML info it provides also falls between two stools. If you know anything about it, this book is trivial. If you are new to it, this book fails to give a good grounding.And, purely personally, I dislike the ""Gosh, hey guys"" style intensely!"
2,You DON'T cetrainly master the FrontPage 98,"I agree with the reader from Canada. There are a lot of repeats to well known issues that should have been ommited. I guess the writers tried to write a ""huge"" book. Readers won't ""master"" the FrontPage 98. And they will get bored - at least I did!"
2,Painstaking detail on how to use Frontpage menus & buttons,"A disappointing title that provides far less than ""mastery"" of Frontpage 98. It is primarily a detailed ramble through the program's features and controls. Illustrative examples are generally poor to none. Editing is poor - whole sentences are frequently repeated without purpose and some paragraphs are incomprehensible. Little effort made to help the reader understand ""why"" he/she may want to use a feature. I'm a 12-year experienced Windows programmer, just tiptoeing into Web development with Frontpage. This book was quite useless for me. Someone who knows nearly nothing about using Windows programs might get a start on Frontpage with this book, but would have to go elsewhere to ""master"" it."
5,Great Deal Great Poster,Looks good in my workout room. Its truly amazing to see the difference in cycling items in the century. The item was as described. nice printing and quality paper.
5,Lovely music,My husband listens to music when he goes to bed and night and he said that this is very soothing and loves it.
5,Best of 2001!,"Dave Valentin, Dave Samuels, Steve Kahn and the other musicians who make up the Caribbean Jazz Project deserve kudos for this incredible CD. Listen to Coltrane's Naima done up with Latin percussion...fantastic from the first notes. Flute, vibes and guitar melded with intense poly-rhythms...this should be a Grammy winner but somehow seems under-publicized. You will not be disappointed!"
4,"great Instrument, great music",If you like Jazz and you love the steel pan; then this is a great blend. The arrangements are superb.
3,not blue,"The Bible was beautiful, however the picture is deceiving. In the picture is a blue bible, but that is just the box that it comes in. The bible is actually pink...great if you are buying for a little girl, but in my case I was buying for a boy. So, as for the actual bible I give it 5 stars, but as for the lack of information, I give it 2-3 stars"
2,Not as good as other cards,"Hardware functional but gets hot. Make sure there is enough air flow. Drivers work, same revision as what can be downloaded from the manufacturer's website. Updated drivers for this card included with DVB-T card. Windows update updates 2 out of 4 drivers. However, media center application does not recognize the card. Supplied software crashes a lot, does not seem to include mpeg decode filter, can only scan for channels once after first install. Other software that claims to work with this card does not always do so."
4,Great reference book for OR nurses (newbie & experienced),"I got my first ""Alexander's Care of the Patient in Surgery"" while I was in nursing school back in the late 80's. We had a perioperative course in nursing school and the book was an excellent resource. I got myself another edition (1995) after I gave away my older book. I have not checked out the 2006 edition (out of stock in local bookstore). Hopefully, there will be more updates on the new advances in surgical procedures."
3,Not as good as older edition,This newer version of Alexander's Patient in Surgery is not as useful as the older versions as they took out the list of surgical instruments set up lst for scrub techs to use as a guide line. This book shows a select group of instruments but the old versions had an actual list of everything you might need for that procedure.I'm very disappointed with this change. Thank goodness I still have the older version to resort back to.
2,Low Quality,"I bought this to help my stomach make a thicker mucous lining to help heal a stomach ulcer. This product helped my ulcer pain slightly. I think it would work better if it didn't have additional ingredients that are stomach irritants. I switched to dried licorice root and it worked tremendously better. The dried root still has the DGL so I had to monitor my blood pressure. If you have high blood pressure the DGL licorice is the way to go, but I would try a different brand than this. I'm not a doctor and I'm not offering this information as medical advice."
2,sits like a rock,"This DGL is as far from chewable as a pill comes. This tablet sits on my tongue like a dirty rock. I bought a twistable pill crusher to try to pulverize it before chewing it. Fifteen minutes of ""crushing"" later more than half of it is still solid. This is the only vegan DGL chewable I could find. The flavor is not too bad. It tastes like it was licorice at one time but with a sandy feel. I've tried sucking on it also, after about fifteen minutes I end up just swallowing it. The reason I am still using it is because I am having chemo therapy treatments right now and my ND recommend the chewable to help with oral erosion. So, I'm stuck with it. If you don't need chewable vegan DGL, then do yourself a favor and try something else."
4,Nice toy,"I got this pony as a Christmas gift for my 5 year old niece and she loved it! Her favorite color is pink so this one was perfect. She has a large collection of the small plastic ponies so I thought this would be a nice addition. The pony has a picture of cotton candy on it, but it actually looks like an ice cream cone (and with a 5 year old you cant go wrong with either!) The pony is soft and the hair isn't stringy or easily tangled."
2,My closet does not smell any different,"I was really hoping this product would work in my closet; however, I am sadly disappointed. My closet smelled fresher for the first day or so, but by the 3rd or 4th day, any scent was long gone. My closet does not smell fresh and it definitely does not smell ""ocean-air fresh!"" The clothes hanging in that closet are not stinky; they are just rarely worn and I wanted something to keep them smelling fresh. On the plus side, I did not spend very much for them - they come in packets of 2. Perhaps they would work better in a much smaller closet. The closet they were hanging in was a normal sized, bedroom closet. I will not be purchasing these again, but I will continue to look for a product that addresses my needs."
2,Worthless,"This product is not worth purchasing, even though it is sold at a very cheap price. Now I understand why. This item barely has a scent. When placed in closet, I did not notice any difference. I defintely will not purchase this item again. SAVE YOUR MONEY & TIME."
3,men's invicta divers watch,"Nice looking, good design, only drawback is when the watch is not worn for 24 hours it stops running and you have to reset time and date when you put it back on. Small hassle, but still an inconvenience each time!"
2,Poor Quality,"I bought this watch Feb '11 and it stopped working accurately in Jan '12. For a few months before that I had to wind it every night because it would not hold enough 'juice' to last through the night anymore. Starting in January though it will only keep correct time about half the time that I'm wearing it. This means that when I look at the watch there's a 50/50 chance it will be correct. Now though, in May, it's never right and if I don't remember to wind it a few times per day it'll be wrong.This is really not acceptable for a ""swiss"" ***cough*** watch. I didn't buy it from Amazon but instead from an online store and only paid $60. It's totally not worth the price of shipping it anywhere for repairs.This review gets two stars because I actually got to use it for nearly a year before the time piece started lying to me on a regular basis.It looks really good, and it's not bulky like other watches I see, so I'm sad to have to give up this watch..."
5,"Great watch, great price","I've been wearing the watch for a few weeks now and the only thing I can find fault with was the instruction manual on how to set the date. The manual covers different version of this watch and it took a little while to discover that the instructions for another version were better written but applicable to mine. Other than that, I love the watch and it looks great. I've discovered that it takes 24 hours for it to wind down so if you don't wear the same watch often and don't want to reset it over a weekend every weekend then maybe you'll have a problem with this, but it's fine for me."
2,Watch Gains Time,My new Invicta Men's Pro Diver Collection Automatic Watch #8928 gains approximately 2 to 3 minutes per week.Will have to send in for warranty repair or replacement.Have paid 1/4 the purchase price of this watch for watches that keep much more accurate time.Robert Jones
5,Very pleased. Nice Watch.,"I was very pleased with this purchase. It has now been three months and it has worked flawlessly. It is a beautiful timepiece modeled after the ever-popular Rolex Submariner. It looks great and works quite well. As with many automatic watches in this price range, it does tend to gain a minute or so every week or two. It is rated for over 600 ft in water depth resistance. I wouldn't know about this as I am not a diver. I do wear it in the shower, washing the dog and have immersed it in the sink while washing dishes. You can buy a fake Rolex that looks similar for about $100, but I have seen them and these fakes are nowhere near the quality of this 8928 Pro Diver from Invicta. If you want that classic Rolex Submariner look without breaking the bank, this is the way to go. I was so satisfied, I bought another larger, more expensive, battery-powered Invicta Pro Diver Chronograph a few weeks later. It, too, has run flawlessly."
1,winder stem fell off,"looks great but the winder stem ""Crown"" fell off when I tried to set the time. This was my first effort, and totally unlike the Invicta 8928OB, which sets easily and runs without gaining or losing time."
3,very nice watch but movement isn't what I expected,"The watch is an elegant yet sporty piece with good construction. HOWEVER, the movement inside isn't what I expected. I thought it would be a Miyota movement that could be hand-wound using the crown, but it isn't. Just like an Orange Monster or Mako diver, this is a non-hacking, non hand-winding movement. I think it's a seiko NH25, instead of a miyota. On the plus side, it has a nicely decorated rotor. But just be aware of this."
3,invicat pro diver,"Nice looking watch, wears well. The stem is hard to retract, and finding the right detent to either set the time or date is difficult. It does keep good time, and is worth the $70 I paid."
1,slow service,"I had my pro diver 5 months before it died. sent it in to invicta with a $28 check ""for shipping"" yeah whatever, seems like a pay as you go warranty to me... well that was on 1-24-11 its now 5-4-11 still no watch... they always say ""call back next week"" guess it's never next week. DON'T BUY INVICTA!!!"
1,Not worth it,"I had this watch for about 5 weeks, hardly wore it as I was keeping it for a nice watch. when I put it on for the third time, I turned out the post to reset the date and the post came off in my hand. I cannot set the watch, use the watch or even wear it now since both the time and date are wrong. I requested a warranty service and they said sure. pay to send it here, wait a minimum of 90 days and please include a check or money order for $28.00 to send it back! What a rip-off. I'm going to save a ferw hundred more and get a REAL swiss watch. Don't waiste your money on this crap."
5,VERY PLEASED,"JUST LOVE IT. THE LOOKS, FEEL, WIGHT, EVERYTHING. A FRIEND SHOWED ME HIS, AFTER 5 YRS, HE STILL LOVED HIS."
4,Invicta Men's Pro Diver Automatic Watch,I like the Invicta Men's Pro Diver Collection of Automatic Watches. I have several color combinations and I love them all. I only wish they would come in either 45 or 47mm sizes. You can't beat the price anywhere.
5,A fine piece of music,This record is really really good. I mean like really good. You just don't know how really good this is. Did I mention that it is really really good?Edit NOV 2009- I just read my own five year old review and don't even remember writing it. What a lame review by a drunken idiot. I stand by the statement that this is a fine piece of music. MORON.
2,this woman has potential,"this woman can sing, but the songs on this cd are too simple, too hip hop, and just too much with trying to be like everyone else in the industry.....i know she has most likely written some music of her own which is really great, but it needs to be shown to the world.....if she hasn't written some really good original stuff, then she may just do extremely well if she had producers who could focus on the ballad power of her beautiful voice.....ie early Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston era type songs........she would sure hit a winner with that genre of music......you go Brooke!!!"
1,Looks like the promoters have been here,"The album sucks...read the 1 star reviews for the truth. Anyone that gave this 5 stars MUST be deaf, or work for the Hogans. Find something that you are good at because it isn't music. Sorry that you spent 3 million out of pocket HUlk to try and buy your daughter fame, but it just isn't going to happen with music."
1,Like Fingernails on a Blackboard!,"The best thing about the songs on this album is that the backup singers and bass obscure Brooke's wretched screech.The best word to describe the song lyrics would be ""insipid"".Hopefully, this will be the only album Brooke ever releases."
2,How Old is This Girl?,"Her voice sounds like that of a child, so it doesn't go well with the R&B-like beats or the lyrics. This sounds like a pre-teen singing someone elses music."
2,"Love Brooke, Hate CD....","Track with Paul Wall is okay, others have no depth. I was not impressed by this CD. I love the Hogan's, but not impressed by Brooke's CD. I was expecting alot more from the album considering it was produced by Scott Storch and the Hit Factory, Storch has had some good hits lately. Just my 2 cents..."
1,Horrible,"First of all, I don't know who other than her parents believes that this girl can sing, but her voice is incredibly annoying, and lacks any depth whatsoever. This is just so phony and contrived. They're packaging her to be something she is not, and it comes off rather desperate. Pathetic, she either needs to find a new career choice or live off of daddy's money."
3,musically...,"...i remember i liked the 1st 7 tracs & musically my favorite lp tracs in order are: 4-For A Moment, 1-About us, tracs 6, 2, 7, 5, 3/ 11, 12, 10/--the rest get lamer--9, 8, 13/ 14-a cd w/ a variety of style. @ highest, i rate this cd apx 3.4 here or 6.8 of a 10.thanksbrooke.her natural voice gets synthetically lost on production on some songs on this lp. maybe not so fair to ask due to the genre here, but wondering, who are the musicians & whose the band?-i guess mostly pc generated.its too bad though that 1 of her best songs too called loveyouboth never made it to either of her cds, probably only due to redtape.hard to say which lp i like better of her 2; that'll take time to hear again.for anyone, on best sounding music, it seems the criteria to make any cd catchy & verygood for its music, for the most part, are: strong music w/ non overproduced-(i.e. pc generated,)noncheezy sounds, good instruments like guitar/keys, etc. & originality as possible, which gets harder in future."
2,Better luck next time,"I'll start by being nice; Brooke's voice is actually quite good, I've certainly heard a lot worse. And - if they didn't tart her up - she's a pretty girl.The problem with UNDISCOVERD is that too much thought went into the style of the music and not the substance of the lyrics. There were no catchy sing-along tracks.In fact, when it comes to the track list, apart from the single `About Us' I'm hard pushed to remember any of the songs.I can remember `My Number' & 'Incognito' for also being above average, though they don't yell hit.The rest of the album isn't especially bad; it's just boring (I can't review each track as I can't remember them), and with nothing to hook in listeners Brooke is destined to remain undiscovered."
2,Never ride on Father's Fame for your success...!!!!,"99 percent of Famous People's kids, luckily born,with a Golden Spoon in their mouth, fail when they try to ride on the success of their parent(s). Brooke would've, could've done better if she did it on her own...(The old fashioned way!!!)...without hanging off her famous father, in almost every Public Appearance. This girl has a wealth of...(her father's money!!)..beauty, talent and charisma! She should've CUT the Umbilical Cord, changed her name...(and not even mention who she was!!!).Then, the public would've accepted her based on TALENT, alone. Another similar case, is Nick Simmons, son of KISS's Gene Simmons.(I suggest now, that Nick get a good Education and FORGET becoming a Rock Star!)."
4,"Cool, still...","Undiscovered could be one of the best pop/r&b; albums of the decade because Brooke's an extremely talented woman, such an amazing voice...but it's a shame the tracks don't help that much...maybe better lyrics and better producers could help....because she definetly gots what it takes to be on top, SHE ROCKS and SHE WANTS TO! That's the difference between her and regular singers nowadays, she has THE WILL to sing!Definetly worth a listen!"
3,More Than Hogan's Daughter,"At first, I thought Brooke was just hyped up because of her dad. But her cd actually turned out to be pretty decent. She has some nice beats from Scott Storch and her lyrics are good as well. They aren't your typical mindless pop lyrics, they actually have meaning. However, Brooke does have a long way to go artistically. She loses her album at the end with silly songs and her vocals need work. She doesn't have the strongest voice out, so she needs to really develop what she has. Overall, with a little work and some more experince, I think Brooke will make a nice pop artist. Star Songs: Beautiful Transformation, Get My Number, About Us, Love/Hate"

A quick read with characters you might have met. Britt makes a case for reporters who care about the victim, too bad she's fictional."
3,Good Mystery,Edna Buchanan is a good writer. Sometimes a little over the top about what her heroin can do but still a good read.
2,"Agree with ""Disappointed""","The dialogue was clumsy, the premise was extremely farfetched and I too found it disappointing."
2,DISAPPOINTING!,"I was very disappointed in this book. I felt that certain scenes dragged which left me bored and turning pages without reading them. The chemistry between Lance and Britt could have been more explosive. There was something always exploding or catching fire in this book, too bad it wasn't them. And then, when a relationship between them is finally established, in the end they part and go their separate ways. I really felt cheated. This was my first taste of Edna Buchanan's work and if her other books are like this one, it'll be my last. Read it and decide for yourself."
5,Insightful,"I am new to 12 step (a little over two years) and am brand new to the bible. I have had a bible but have only read a little here and there. An OA sponsee of mine told me about this bible and how it ties together 12 step recovery and its principles from the bible. Since I'm new to all of this, I decided to embark on the 6 month reading plan at the back of the book...so far it's going well and I am loving the ""life connections"" and step indicators throughout the bible. Highly recommend it."

5,One source,There are enough books on nutrition to make your head spin. This book breaks it down nicely and gives you all the information you'll need. It helped me to put together a great nutritional program to help me lose the fat and gain lean muscle. I'd recommend it to anyone who'd like to change their lifestyle for the better.
3,High Performance Nutrition: The Total Eating Plan to Maximize Your Workout,"As a personal trainer, this is nothing earth shattering that I haven't seen before. For someone looking for all the information under one cover, it's good."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"I have been a life-long fan of Conway Twitty. I have been waiting for some feedback on this DVD for some time, with no luck. So I decided to buy it myself.This has got to be the WORST ""Documentary"" I've ever seen. For the first 25 minutes they talk more about Elvis and hardly even mention Conway. It's only a 30 minute show, with 25 minutes covering Elvis' career. It's got people who don't even know him. Some of the facts are wrong too. Just a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!! DO NOT WAST YOUR MONEY!!!"
5,Great gift,My Mom loved this gift and was very excited that she can watch Conway and listen to him now as well!
2,"Cute story, but very little educational value.","I volunteer in public education for a large fire department and am always looking for good books to read to children. I was very disappointed when I received this book. The story shows ""Mickey and Friends"" getting the old fire engine ready for a parade, while they brag about things they have done as junior volunteers. The book briefly discusses the difference between a pumper truck and a hook and ladder. No other mention is made of fire apparatus, equipment, or the job of being a firefighter. The books greatest shortcoming is that there is absolutely NO fire safety message in this book."
5,Sophisticated & Fun,"Elegantly packaged to preserve these fine lead cystal glasses to ensure you receive them intact or as a terrific gift. Inner box is deep blue with the Mikasa logo measuring roughly 20"" long by about 12"" wide and 9"" deep. What a great presentation. The glasses are designed to hold today's larger size pour keeping the precious cargo well below the rim. They stand tall and sit flat on the table with a more conical look than the old-style flatter style. Talk about a conversation item...WOW. I am totally satisfied. The $39.99 price is a real value. ""Free"" Prime Shipping makes this a winner. Guess I need to order the other Cheers Collection pieces."
5,Sublime,"This is music to soothe bothmother and child. I've bought 2copies this year as 'new baby""gifts! Beautiful music by a talentedartist."
5,Soothing songs of Ireland for children or adults,"This a a beautiful, fairly unadorned album of Irish songs that are showcased best by the simplicity. This is not a CD of ambiant music, or New Age style riffs. Most of the songs are accompanied by the harp and Margie Butler's gentle voice. These songs bring to life a picture of Ireland--the rural countryside, the farmlands and the changing seasons. Many of the songs contain elements of sweet sadness and melancholy. ""October Wind"" is familiar and wonderful. ""The Eagle's Whistle"" has to be my favorite on the album and always makes me homesick. If you can find this album, enjoy with a cup of tea in your hands or a child in your arms, or however you like to relax."
2,Waste of Money,"This book is extremely vacant of any interesting insight into Sasha Cohen's life. While she could've explored and actually discussed her reasons for switching coaches and her successes and failures, she gave party line accounts of events and information can be gathered from watching a 4 minute fluff piece on Sasha at a skating competition. It'll take a book from Brennan to unlock the controversies surrounding Sasha Cohen."
1,Don't waste your time.,"From beginning to end, I found this book to be dreadful, and an utter waste of my time. Champion? Of what? She is the queen of making excuses, and really, isn't it too soon for an autobiography? Do yourself a favor, skip over this book."
4,Nice intro to W. African music,"This CD was my first exposure to West African music. Surprise! They aren't limited to bongo drums and acapella chants! I've fallen in love with several of the songs on this CD, and so have my children. We are now tracking down and collecting the CD's of the artists we enjoyed most! Great variety."
5,Re-Limed....,I would not say it's the best Lime CD ever but it's a great CD to own! Some people like to live in the past and want artists to keep making the same sone over & over again... Well I for one am gald they are back with some stuff that sounds of the Lime from day's gone by and some great NEW sounds! If you want the Lime of yester-year buy the Greatest Hit's CD again... BUt if you want something new get this one .. It's a really great CD!!!
4,pretty cool,"I love the first track Just Pretend with everyone giving equally to the song. The rest of the album seems like a single from each artist. Not that it's bad, since they are all three talented artists, but since this is a collaboration, I would have to liked to hear the influence of all three on the songs."
4,Start with a Digital Camera,"some of the material was a little dated, but overall, it was well written and it contained some excellent information and ideas for handling images."
2,Something missing,"The book is missing something rather important...""Now that I've captured an image, how do I get the color to match what I see, what's on my monitor and on my printer?""The section on page 100, Color Accuracy, is incorrect. The author needs to develop an understanding of image color management. An image can be printed out of any number of applications and the color will be the same. The print driver menus can cause the color to change...not the application. Also, a properly color managed image will look similar in RGB and CMYK, not as shown in this book.This is a good book for hobbyists who are not concerned with accurate color, which is fine as long as the book buyer understands this. Those who are concerned with color calibration and management should spend their money elsewhere."
5,Blue Cheer Rocks Europe,"Rocks EuropeSimply stated, these guys, are KILLER!!! This is the next best thing to actually seeing them live. If you enjoy REAL loud, hard, Blues/Rock, then this is what you need. These guys will amaze you. After more than FORTY YEARS, they nail it!!Do yourself a favor, and BUY THIS DVD.Doctor Please, alone, is worth the price of the DVD, and the interview with Dickie, is priceless."
4,Great Boots!!,"I recieved a pair of these as a birthday gift from my wife. She bought them to replace my old service boots. I have to say the comfort level of these boots is phenominal. They provide great support around the ankle and up the lower portion of your leg. The padding of the sole makes you feel like you're walking on air. The zipper on the side is great to get them off quickly without having to un-lace them to pull your foot out. I only giave these 4 stars because they give the illusion that your feet are larger then they appear, even considering I had to get a size smaller then what I normally wear. Other then that these are great boots and function well for riding."
3,Dissapointed,"Dmx's first cd was undoubtebly his best, and one of my most favorite cd's of all time. His second, was good, his third, alright, and this one ehhh. there are only a few tracks on this cd i like- who we be, we right here, and damien 3. I think X could've done a much better job on this cd, hopefullly his next one will be better. if u dont have dmx's first cd GET IT! YOU DONT KNOW WAT YOUR MISSIN!Oh yeah, instead of gettin this, get jay-z's new cd ""blueprint"" I love this cd, especially the song renegades with eminem. Blueprint is alot better than his last cd ""the dynasty,"" And a hell of alot better than dmx's cd ""the great depression."" get ""the Blue print"" you won't regret it!"
3,It's ok,"When I first listened to this cd, It was tight. Then the 2nd time I listened to it all the way thru, I fell asleep. It was 2 pm. Let me tell you. X is a brilliant rapper, but ever since and then there was X, the albums are off a little. On a scale from one to 100 It's Dark and Hell is hot is a 90, Flesh of my flesh is a 98, And then there was X is a 70 and Great Depression is about a 74. X still has it, but his flow is missing something. But don't get me wrong, X was one of the greatest in only 2 albums and is still one of the all time greatest."
2,OH NO!!!,If you are a fan of DMX like I am then you are very dissapointed with this album......and I mean very. This album is the most mediocre out of all his CD's.Don't buy this.....maybe you can burn it on your cd burner but that's it. I am done with this review dang it! I am highly upset!I don't recommend this Cd if you are a hardcore fan and I am pretty sure that he doesn't have a base of real hardcore fans but hey you never know. Well his not now after this piece of a bad album. Well I am officially done hope this helped your decision. Peace!!
2,DMX -GREAT DEPRESSION,THIS CD WAS REALLY DEPRESSING. IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE ONE OF THE BEST BUT IT TRULY SUCKED. I LISTENED TO IT MAYBE 4 TIMES AND IT'S NOW IN MY OLD CD RACK COLLECTING DUST. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CD BECAUSE I AM A BIG DMX FAN. I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED.
5,Dmx,"Aight,Dmx may never be as good as on It's dark and hell is hot,but he comes close on this one,probably his 2nd best album,he tells the truth on all his songs,his heartfealt lyrics overshadow his lyrical limitations.The highlights of the Cd is A minite for your son;i miss you;bloodline anthem;who we be;and trina moe"
4,x is back,"over the past 5 years DMX has all ways given us his heart in hisLP's and after taking a break people said he could't provide hitslike he has but guess what he's back and better then ever, and with his new LP (THE GREAT DEPRESSION) he has proven that youcan't keep that dog away for long."
4,DMXs New Album - The Great Deperession,"Having owned all of DMXs previous albums, I think that ""And then there was X"" is his best album, this album is a VERY close second, it has some excelent tunes such as ""The Bloodline Anthem"" and ""Damien III"" to name a few. Well worth getting :)"
2,Who we be ain't who we were...,"Who we be is the only (and I mean only) song on this albumn worth listening to. The song with Stephanie Mills is out of key and off beat, poorly sampled. The song with faith is redundant and a waste of Faith's voice. ""Shorty was da bomb"" X is trying to take a page out of Ja Rule's book (I know I know that X came first) of singing the Chorus and he doesn't quite have the voice for that. Overall this was a waste of money...My advice...copy ""Who we be"" (which coincedentally ISN'T the one that you hear on the radio with him doing the ""DaDun DaDun DaDun"" during the chourus) off of the CD, and then take it to Kemp Mill or whatever store in your area that buys used CD's, and SELL IT! You may end up getting only about $2 or $3 for it, but to be honest, that's more that what it's worth. Take the money an buy a used copy of ""It's dark and hell is hot..""I don't know what these other knuckleheads are talking about but in short....THE CD (is bad)!"
5,X is Back,"THis Cd is great. IT is the second best cd hes made , second only to its dark and hell is hot. Ive been a big Dmx fan and this is a good solid album. Its got numerous hot songs, and the bonus tracks are BLAZIN!!!!! Who we be and Damien 3 show dmx lyrical talent and are bangers. Trinamoe is a hella tight song. He still follows his murderous rampage songs with ima bang and #11 and it still works. He also gives a message in most of his songs. I Miss You and A Minute 4 ur son, shroty was the bomb are the most inspired songs an are great to listen too when ur just chillin. Be sure to listen to the 3 bonus tracks after the last song, all 3 are Hella TIght and show the new bloodline rappers (...). Anny dmx fan will love this album."
3,DMX Fan Who Is Keeping It Real,"Yo this DMX album is nice. I think it's worth the money. It's better than the last album and then there was X, but still doesn't touch his debut album. This album is trying to create a strre feel instead of being a street album, like It's Dark and Hell Is Hot was. But if you like X, than go cop the album it's worth your money... and that's all you really ask for!"
5,This CD Rocks,"DMX is the bomb! Yet again with his newest release the GREAT DEPRESSION he has shown that he is the king of HIP HOP! The Best songs on the album are We Right Here, Who We Be, Trina Moe, I Miss You, and I'MA Bang. DMX has stuck to his roots and he is still a hard core rapper."
3,New X is mediocre AGAIN,"i was hopping that the great depression would bring x out of the water after his dissapointing last lp, but i guess he's been concentrating more on acting than writing lyrics. Although it doesnt compare to the first two x discs, the great depression has a few mint tracks. bloodline anthem and damien 3 are among the best. the two skits on this cd are obviously time fillers cause they're absolute garbage! although this cd wasn't awesome, it wasnt bad so i'd recomend it"
4,Good effort from the D-Man,"Better than the second and third as X becomes more in-tune with his inner self. Not quite up to the 1st album's mark yet, though.I would recommend this album to rap fans, definitely to X fans."
3,NOT DA BOMB,This c.d was not very good for DMX. His songs were not steady and it didn't click. He dosn't have a good rappong voice.
1,Why?,"X used to be the man, now he [stinks]. There aren't any really good songs on this album other than the songs that have been played out by now. X needs to get his act together or gimme my money back."
3,dmx rulz but grand champ iz betta,this is da worst dmx cd. its skary enuff to skare away sum kids. I like songs on this cd tho like who we be. Get grand champ instead. avoid ja rule he sux.
2,A review of DMX's The Great Depression.,"From what I have heard by DMX, The Great Depression is not a good album. Neither is any other of his work. You will probably only like this cd if you are into rap. I'm really not into the mainstream rap music.I don't care for any of the tracks on here. I only bought the album because I thought that it featured somethng else on it. Plus, I unknowillingly purchased the clean version. I can't stand the edited version. The only factor that saved this record from a one star rating was the cover and photography.You shouldn't buy this cd if you're like me.Try music like C-BO, Spyro Gyra, The Rippingotns, Skywalk, some Rush, and some Blue Oyster Cult. Those are the good groups. Thank you for taking the time and generosity to read my review."
2,Depressing,"What's happanend to you X. You were the next rap prodigy with your ""Dark and Hell is Hot Album"" and continued on from their with your ""Flesh of my Flesh"" and ""And Then there was X""(Your Best) and a few Ruff Ryder collabos and soundtracks. But this album was by far your weakest album yet.People will always love DMX but it was depressing listening to this album. You have been raping about the same stuff since day 1. ""Bring it"" was a good single but got old fast. ""Who we be"" is the classic DMX song in which he raps to beat, bar for bar. ""Bloodline anthem""(or is it a rock anthem) was also a good song. But the rest of the album was lacking flavour, because it was lacking the production of Swizz Beatz.Overall it is DMXs worst album to date, but it will sell. And I will buy his next album, but if its worse than this then Im through with X."
3,ok,"ok cd from dmx. best songs are who we be, we right here,and i miss you f/faith evan{a deep song about his grandma}"
2,Not what he used to be,"Okay, let me start out by saying that DMX is/ has been one of the greatest rappers, but he's just not like he used to be. His last 3 albums, (Flesh of my Flesh Blood of my Blood, It's Dark and Hell is Hot, And then there was X) were absolutely terrific. Almost every song on those CD's were great. But The Great Depression, just doesn't really have all that good of songs. There are two good songs on it. Who We Be, and We Right Here. The rest are just not good. It seems by looking at this album he just doesnt have it any more."
4,It's OK,"NOt to bad, but not his best I assure you, the lyrical flow is pretty intense and the beats that follow are awesome but the whole thing as a whole isn't as great as his previous albums."
4,ALMOST THE BEST,"This CD is the second best i have. ALL the songs are awesome!! unfortunetely, they get boring to quickly. Dont know why DMX particuraly. This is a must buy!! Trina moe is my favorite song even though most people hate it. nothimg more to say."
2,I Cant Believe this......,"Someone had told me this is his best album since ""Its Dark and Hell is Hot""What was that fool thinking when he told me that? What makes it so funny is that he is a deep underground head. So I took his work for it and got this album. Big mistake. Real hip-hop heads know DMX 1st album is his best work. After ""Its Dark and Hell is Hot"" was dropped it has been all downhill for DMX. His previous two albums were average. Nothing compared to his 1st. Its sad to say becaue I thought ""And Then There Was X"" was the worst DMX could possibly ever put it, I was wrong. This album is pure garbage, subpar beats with well below garbage lyrics. You can tell from the intro that DMX spent about a day on this album, seriously. If you dont believe me check it out. I gave it two stars because the firs track is pretty hot."
1,THE WORST,What happened.....the two singles X dropped were just to trick people into buying a garbage album. Someone in his camp should have kept it real with him and told him the truth. He said that all the other M.C.'s wouldn't eat after this album drops...better think again. He might want to do like he did back in '98 and drop another album quick before he looses his faithful followers. Out of all the rappers this fall I expected X to be the hottest...but Jay-z and Nas proved me wrong....Don't waste your money People
2,DMX IS IN DEPRESSION !!!,"IN THIS ALBUM DMX IS WAY DIFFERENT.HIS ATTITUDE TOWARD WHITES HAS CHANGED HIS HAD BROUGHT DOWN THE WHITES SAYING ""YOU BRING THE WHITEBOY IN THIS RAP GAME (...) HE HAS NO FAME"".NOT THEM EXACT WORDS BUT IN THAT WAY.THE ONLY THING THAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS ALBUM IS THE DIFFERENT BEATS,IN THIS ALBUM THE BEATS ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAT THE ONES IN HIS LAST 3 ALBUMS.DMX AND HIS DOG LIFESTYLE NEEDS TO GET PUT TO SLEEP,CAUSE DOG YOU DMX YOUR BARKING HAS TO STOP IT IS JUST GETTING OLD & PLAYED OUT.IF YOU ARE A DMX FAN THEN PICK THIS ALBUM UP,BUT TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH YOU AIN'T MISSING NOTHING SPECIAL IF YOU DON'T PICK THIS ALBUM UP BELIEVE ME.THE EAST COAST RAP IS GETTING PLAYED OUT AND DON'T GIVE PUFFY A MICROPHONE,HE'S EVEN WORSE THAN DMX."
3,Good...but the CD lacks consistancy.,"DMX's latest album, with its two new singles, is fairly good, a recommended buy. Great beats, the songs Who We Be, We Be Right Here, and I Miss You are the best tracks, but other than that there aren't many more really good songs, and that makes the album wear as you listen to it...Maybe you should download some of the songs and not buy the album...whatever you do, know that DMX did a great job with the tracks that were good!"
1,Watch for false prophets,"Two things are not right:1. Paul was NOT an Apostle.2. Paul DID NOT WALK with the Person of Jesus.I will not buy this book as it is a FALSE WITNESS.Paul as Saul was a persecuter of The Way, as the first Christians were called. He wasn't called untill his conversion on the road to Damascus.Acts 7:57 - 8:1At this they covered their ears and, yelling at the top of their voices, they all rushed at him, dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul.While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, ""Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."" Then he fell on his knees and cried out, ""Lord, do not hold this sin against them."" When he had said this, he fell asleep.And Saul was there, giving approval to his death.Read the REAL STORY, read the BIBLE."
1,Dumb book,"I like ordering from you on the net but the downside is that I don't get to look at the book before buying it.I ordered a book I thought my wife would like called The Messengers by Julia Ingram (she likes angels).When it came it took me a short time to see that it was not up to standard--a pablum sort of book. Popular in the worst sense. We are interested in angels, but real, credible angels, angels and ideas (or their authors) with intellectual force. We read university level non-fiction mainly. This book is poor.So my question is, how do I return this book which my wife prevailed on me to inscribe (unread) since it was a gift. And what is your policy in general, for future reference?Thanks"
5,read this before you die,This book has had the most profound effect of any book I have read in many many years. I reccomend it to anyone who is in touch with their heart (or wants to be.
5,Meet the Angels!,"When I first read this book last year, I was just opening up to spirituality and the presence of angels. I know now that God and the angels guided me to read the book so that I could learn more about how the angels are with us every single day, and they are here to help. My intuition told me that everything in the book was indeed true, and I loved reading of all the angel experiences. Now, approximately one year later, I myself have conversations with the angels on a daily basis and they are my best friends. We all benefit by opening to their Divine, healing presence and asking them to help us with our lives. Thank you, Nick, for sharing your story with the rest of us!"
3,Promising much and delivers some.,"The lead up to reading 'the manuscript' promised a great deal - very much like Celestine Prophecies - but did not deliver. The premise is good and the book enjoyable. I wasn't convinced. If it had been more like ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth"" by Richard G. Patton - another book in a similar vein - it could have gone a great deal further toward making Angels in our lives a distinct reality. If the question and answer section (the 'manuscript') had been put more into historical context with a few details beyond general chat, I could have given it a much higher rating. All in all, I would recommed this book since it does offer intriguing possibilities."
5,A message of hope,"The Messengers is an amazing book, I was enthralled by the journey experienced by Nick Bunick. The overall feeling of the book was one of hope, a commodity becoming most rare in todays economic and political upheaval. I am now safe in the knowledge that I will continue to exist on many planes after I finally shed this mortal coil."
2,Promises so much but delivers so little,"I was sadly dissappointed by ""THE Messengers"". It is clearly two different books inside the same cover. The first part promises revelation but the second part is VERY tame and largely derivative. I prefer a more gritty and compelling book such as Patton's ""THE Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth..."" which is quietly unassuming but PACKED with revelation. Messengers is like the trailers that they show for films they know won't have 'legs'. The film is hyped so much that people are conned into seeing the movie before word gets out just how bad it is. This book had great potential and the cover is the best I've ever seen, but sadly...."
4,very interesting read,"I found thhis book to be very interesting. It awoke my initial,child taught beliefs and made me think. It is almost frightning NOT to believe"
3,"Two-part book, better off seperate. Worth a read though.","The Messengers is two books crudely patched together, yet both worthy in their own right. The first section is well written without emotional conviction and the second half does not deliver what the first half promises. After just reading ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"" and it's portrayal of Paul, the ""Messengers"" comes a poor second. The first half is well crafted though not a little derivative of Celestine Prophecies and it's search for THE Manuscript. The second half, though perhaps genuine, carries no more weight than a couple of average theologians positing likely scenarios around the time of the crucifixion. Nick Brunwick (the present incarnation of St. Paul) would have done better to publish his regression tapes without all the fair-ground razzle dazzle that preceeds the final telling. ""Methinks he doth protest too much"" - or rather too loudly."
2,Anti climatic,"I just finished listening to Messangers. one of the things I found most disturbing was the narritive. a story this personal should have been written in the first person. I found myself wondering why a third person was describing how Nick ""felt"". And if Nick was now so detrmend to make himself known why did he not!! This was my first audio book. what a disapointment!"
3,"I bought the book, sadly - not the plot.","Although I had very much wanted to, I couldn't believe ""The Messengers"". While the 'hero' may himself believe he is the reincarnation of St. Paul, he didn't convince me. As an earlier reviewer stated, it does appear to be two distinctly different books, crudely patched together. Each would have been greater on its own. For believability, these authors should look at the far more credible and inspiring ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"" by Richard G. Patton. - And Patton doesn't use the Celestine Prophecies 'technique' of a quest for 'THE Manuscript' which 'The Messengers' have borrowed."
1,Dumb book,"What bothers me is that I bought this book. It was over-hyped by Amazon. I didn't realize it was a religious tract. I thought it was about angels--I mean, real, serious, angels.Angels--they don't necessarily exist, it is the idea of them that is so real--can be compelling. Black angels, white angels, macho angels, angels sent on special missions, heavenly CIA Agent angels, KGB angels, Nazi angels.The way I see angels, they are the ones who do the dirty work for God and the Devil--hit men, agent provocateurs, party slush fund agents, spies and burglars.Angels are interesting. But The Messengers is not about angels as I understand them. Don't buy this book"
1,Absolutely Goes against the Bible!!,"This book may be interesting and it may have some good things to say. I found it is a book that promotes showing love to people...BUT if you take this book to be true then you must completely reject the Bible. At no point in the book does it line up with the Bible. If you hold to the teachings of the Bible you will see that the way it presents Jesus and Saul is completely different from what is taught in the Bible. I found it interesting that at no point does it agree with exactly how the Bible is written. It completely questions the validity and puts the focus on Angels on the same level as their Creator God. I recommend that you purchase the book, ""The Stranger on the road to Emmaus"" which expains the Bible in a way that helps to solve the puzzle of the Bible. Plus, how do you know all angels are good?"
4,4 post-Bach late German Baroque vocal works,"This is a disc of German early music specialist Hermann Max conducting with Hungarian soprano Maria Zadori among the soloists. As with many of Max's discs on Capriccio and CPO it is a revival of some of the rarely heard late baroque vocal works that form the background to Bach and Telemann.The disc starts with two settings of Psalm 51, Misere in C, the first by the Czech composer Zelenka, the second by the Berlin opera composer Adolf Hasse. This is followed by Dresden composer Heinichen's Magnificat in A, and concluded by German Cantata in 5 movements by the rarely heard Homilius. (The five movements are Verwundrung, Mitleid.. Wie Ist Mir.. Verheertes Land, In Deinen Trummern.. O Sicherer Mensch, Was Schlafest Du.. Ei Nun, Herre Jesu, Schicke Unsre Herzen Zu)."
3,Beautiful Case - with a few problems----,"This case is georgous. Beautiful craftsmenship and a belt clip that is the most sturdy and functional of all the cases I have tried. Protective and it will not scratch the screen with cards in the pockets. However, The T2 and case were able to be in the cradle for a hotsync - Not so with the T3. There is an opening at the bottom to plug in - but not in the cradle. MAJOR draw-back and the reason I will return mine. Found 2 leather flip cases so far that will allow this - senna and pdair."
5,Charles -review,"It looks good from looking at the cover, but I would like to know what songs are on it."
3,Missing the Funeral Song!!,"I would have given it 4 stars, but the creepy kids music/funeral music wasn't on here! The main theme to Ghosthouse is pretty and haunting (as it should be!), and the second track is spooky and atmospheric as well. The best, though, is track 5...funky beat! The rest of the album, however, is filler. The main themes are repeated in different versions, and some sound VERY dated. Id recommend it though."
3,Less Than Platinum,"This is volume 1 of 2 and both were originally released by Platinum Disc Corporation which was purchased by Echo Bridge. However, all episodes on both discs contain an intrusive and distracting Platinum Disc logo in the lower right corner. You can find these episodes from other distributors such as Critic's Choice and even if they are slightly more expensive, are worth the extra money."
5,The Jester,"I saw this book in the supermarket, read the summary in the back and put it down right away....Having just finished ""1st. To Die, I was on a bit of a Patterson kick...two days later I was back at the market and found myself looking at the book again..Year 1089, the crusades, medevil times....??--oh what the heck on a whim I bought it and enjoyed every minute of it..Yes I cut throught it like a hot knife thru butter..and like many other reviews stated some of the ""modern terms"" used seemed a bit out of place, but to me at that point your so engrossed in the story, you kinda glaze over it .I loved the story and rooted for Hugh from the beginning, his determination, his strength.. My opinion of this book is if its set in medevil times, written in a way that has a modern tone and you still can picture the country side and characters it has done its job...and it did a dam good one at that :-)"
1,James Patterson must be a jester himself,"Not only was this pitiful story filled with annoying inaccuracies, anachronisms and gratuitious violence, but it seems as if written by an adolescent. The story didn't flow well, the main character was repetitive and corny, and everytime the writing started to settle down into *some* semblance of normalcy, he'd ruin it by throwing in some grotesque scene. ""Oh yeah, it's been 5 pages - must be time for another round of mutilated bodies!"" It was third rate - at best. I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to accept without rancor the ""hey buddy"" and ""he's so cute"" lines.I felt slightly better about The Lake House, but I won't be reading James Patterson again."
1,The Jester by Pattersen,"Reads like a Class B Movie, and has no redeeming value.Much unecessary sick violence and I'm sorry I wasted the money on it. Never buy a book by two authors because they obviously get in each others way as looks like what happened in this book.Too melodramatic. The whole section on the Crusade could have been shortened to one small chapter. Too many silly improbables.My advice: Don't buy it. I'll never buy another book by this author. I will also always be susicious of the great positivereviews........don't you ever report a ""negative"" review like this ?"
3,"Interesting idea, weak execution...","The basics of the story is interesting enough, but the authors did not do a good enough job of conveying the feel of the period, whether in social/physical details or in conversations. Perhaps this book is an example of research-lite."
2,Not my cup of tea!,"While I thought I might be interested in a novel told during the time of the Crusades (I love period fiction), this one just seemed to get annoying. OK, Hugh is a wonderful person, looking for his wife. On a mission. He just caused the death of too many people...people I didn't even have a feel for. Maybe that was the plan! The only thing that held my interest was the Jester's tricks and jokes he played on the high commander. Those insults caused a slight chortle!After reading historical fiction like ""The Dress Lodger"" and""The Pink and the White"", this just seemed a lame attempt at trying to tell a story with any credence. Patterson, stick to what you do best. FBI serial killer fiction. This was boring!Passed it on to a friend with a disclaimer!"
2,very much like ken folletts --Pillars of the earth,"did it seem to you that this book was very much like Ken Folletts , ""Pillars of the Earth""? Of course by far a simplified version. How about the wife situation? Lose one to tragedy but find another quickly. Did'nt that happen in both books? Ken Follett did a much better in depth story about that period of time. In fact I am surprised that Follett's is not a classic. The Jester was not one of Patterson's best."
2,Don't waste your time,This book came highly recommeded by a freind. And boy does her taste in books suck. This story is so unbelievable. Don't waste your time. I wish I could get back that week of my life I spent reading this.
1,Absolutely Awful and That's No Jest!,"I am a big James Patterson fan and I knew this book was going to be something different, but I never expected it to be so unreadable. I read 50 pages before concluding I had better things to do with my time (luckily, it was a library book!). The book was boring and very violent. I wish that Patterson had given us another Alex Cross book instead."
2,Tried something new.... didn't work.,"I had high hopes when I saw that James Patterson had tried to branch out and try something new. I expected something along the line of Michael Crichton's ""Timeline"" . I was very disappointed. While it was a quick read, I found it to be beneath Patterson's usual quality of writing. The plot definately had potential but I don't think Patterson did it justice.My advice.... skip this one or just borrow it from the library."
1,Save your money II!,"In the beginning of the book, a religious artifact is found in the grave of a jester. At the end of the book, it is buried with a cruel lord. The daughter of the King of France is allowed to run around the country pretty much by herself. The jester successfully overthroughs a fiefdom and the King of France and other nobles are not one bit threated. Give us a break. I've read better high school themes that this book."
1,Ludicrous!,"The whole plot was ludicrous and not well-written. The Jester was a pulp Western done up in Medieval armor written by someone who had neither a sense of time nor place of the late 11th century and a total lack of knowledge of the mores and social sensibilities of the period. He used every cliche possible in this sub-standard revenge, hidden identity, good guy-bad guy, star-crossed lover pot boiler. If you really want to read about the Medieval period, try Ellis Peters or Sharon Kaye Penman, but don't waste your time or money with this trash."
1,The Jester,BOOOOOOO! to you Mr. Patterson. Your writing becomes worse and worse. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE LAST NOVEL OF YOURS I WILL BUY. Shame on you.
1,The Jester,Cannot tell you how disappointed I am with this book. Read about 70 pages and could take no more. The killing and torturing were just not something I need to hear.
1,So bad I laid it down . . .,"I'm a Patterson fan. This one, however, was not readable. I only finished 100 pages and finally gave up. The writing was flat, the story was dull, the characters were uninteresting. Perhaps it would get better in the end, but I did not care to find out."
3,Not up to par,"I was very disappointed in this book. I love historical books but this was !like reading Danielle Steele, very trite."
1,"Fiction, yes. Historical? Only as a backdrop.","I picked up this story hoping for historical fiction, that is, insight into another era using a storyline as a tool to stir interest.What I found was --- blah. Predictable storyline, no character development, an egocentric ""hero,"" 7th grade bathroom humor lacking any subtlety, and no more insight into history than one gathers as general knowledge through movies.Where is the author that can write a true historical fiction on the middle ages, with the same depth and insight as found with Pearl S Buck and China? Please tell me!However, if you're looking for a lot of brutal violence, template romance and tiresome ""sex"" jokes, and only care to spend 2 minutes per chapter, here is your book!"
1,What time period does this take place in?,"The mood and scene was often interrupted by none period dialouge and vugarities as this super healing hero zoomed from one adventure to another. This story would have faired better if it had been published as a comic book.It reminded me of Kevin Costner playing Robin Hood and sounding as if he was talking to some friends on 42St.The co-authurs should take a cue from, to name just two, Ellis Peters, Simon Hawke. When doing a period piece; stay there."
1,Medieval Skit,"I had never read anything before by James Patterson...and based on this book, I never will again! Perhaps his contemporary novels don't grate on the nerves quite so jarringly? I had picked this book up because I'm interested in the Crusades era, and thought that this one sounded interesting from the description and the glowing reviews. What a disappointment. The story is set during the Crusades, but the characters act and speak in contemporary ways. The medieval setting is as shallow and unbelievable as a painted backdrop for a high school skit. The plot barrels along at breakneck speed, so I suppose if you want something quick and diverting to read on an airplane, this might be adequate. However, if you want a fascinating book that immerses you in medieval times with realistic characters...this isn't it."
1,Big Disappointment,No long dissertation just hope he will get back to what he does best and this isn't it! First Patterson writing I haven't completed and enjoyed.
4,Fun Read,"One of James Patterson's best. Wish that he'd write more like this. It really points out that several rulers of the medieval Europe terribly abused their power and that, in general, most people worked for a bare living, if that.We also see that churchmen often colluded with the rulers in mistreatment of the people."
3,Good but different for Patterson,"I heard so many bad things about this book, I almost didn't read it. I found it at our local library and read it in two days. I liked the book, some of the battle scenes were a bit bloody, but I thought the story line worked and the characters seemed real. I probably would not recommend buying it but look for it in the library."
4,Entertainingly informative,"I liked this book and found it entertaining to read. I felt it was refreshing, and while it touched on many of the horrifying events of the time period, it also took us into the daily lives of the people who lived it in a way that made you smile.I learned much from it that I did not know. I read some of the other reviews that claimed it was historically inaccurate but when I checked sources I could find no real inaccuracies.Even the placement of the holy relic (the lance) that the story talks about COULD have been where the book placed it. Although the lance is claimed to have been seen after the story ends, it is currently unaccounted for.I agree with another review that said that the prologue of the book was never tied in at the ending. That bothered me a little, otherwise I probably would have given the book five stars."
3,"Unlike other Patterson books, but good enough.","Jester is unlike any other Patterson book that I have read, and I am quite a Patterson fan. The book is a love story that takes place in Europe during the Crusades. It has some real sad points in the story but the main character, Hugh, triumphs in the end and the reader is left with a happy feeling. It is a very easy read that did not seem to totally occupy my mind. One of the other reviewers mentioned that it seemed to have been written by an ""adolescent"" and I have to agree with that thought. I will give this book a three star rating and recommend it, especially now that it is out in paperback."
4,Extremely enjoyable,"I found this book to be the best of Pattersons books thus far. I enjoyed the departure from his current-day surroundings to ones that are from the time of the crusaides. I felt, however, that he could have been a bit less repetitious in some aspects. For example, the Jester's frequent lamentings for his wife gets tiresome in its often rehashed detailing. And the Jester's forboding that he is going to die with each encounter has a bit too much melodrama. But, overall, I enjoyed the book and have recommended it to friends and family."
1,Tried but just couldn't continue,"I tried to finish the book but just couldn't. With so many good books to read and so little time, it just wasn't worth it. I am really surprised at all the 5 star reviews. I have read all of Patterson's books and this one and Beach House are definitely the worst."
4,Good Brain Candy,"I'm a loyal Patterson fan, so I bought and read this book without knowing anything about it all. It took me about 3 sessions over 2 days to get through it. Not exactly high literature, but it was very entertaining. A good story and interesting characters made it a real page turner. True, it is quite violent (but not much worse than other Patterson novels), but come on, it's medieval France. What can you expect? That wasn't really a very gentle time or place in.My only complaint, as with most Patterson novels, is the ridiculously short chapters. Sure it makes for an easier read, but the number of one and two page chapters in this book was a bit extreme. I find it disruptive, especially when a single scene that should fill one chapter ends up taking up five or six."
2,Jest not good enough,"I love James Patterson and have read just about all of his books, but this book is by far a huge disappointment! I labored through the book, skimmed most of it, found it predictable as well as horribly written. I am not a huge fan of historic fiction and decided to read it through the end anyway, to see where it would do. Unfortunately, it went nowhere. The descriptive violence was gross, the story lacked continuity and cohesiveness, and other parts of the story seemed to have been pulled from somewhere else.This book is just not worth reading - read Patterson's other books instead!"
1,I'd Give it a 0 if I could,"How bad can a book be.....truly bad. It is hard to believe The Jester was written as a serious novel....it is repetitive, poorly written, inaccurate, unbelievable...a children's tale with sex and violence. I could go on and on. I will simply say....DON'T BUY IT...DON'T BORROW IT. DON'T READ IT."
1,Stick to Alex Cross,It is hard to fathom that this book was written by the same James Patterson of Alex Cross fame.This book is a contrived tale about a man who becomes a Jester to find his wife (other reviews will tell you more). Don't bother. It is as exciting as a comic book.
1,Don't waste your time or money!,"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. James Patterson is usually one of my favorite authors, but I can only read about so many dead children before I just have to stop. I am only halfway through, but am giving up the ghost. I normally have no problem with any amount of violence or profanity in books, but the gratuitous infanticide and the out-of-place modern-day profanity could have been left out. It still wouldn't have made this enjoyable, but it would have at least been readable."
2,First and last Patterson novel,"Never having read James Patterson before, and being a devoted fan of good historical fiction, I decided to give The Jester a whirl. Although I liked the short chapters and the plot concepts were good, it severely lacked significant detail and persuasion. I was looking for something in line with Ken Follett's great historical novel, Pillars Of The Earth, and I was disappointed with The Jester. I'll take a long, leisurely, detailed fiction any day as opposed to this so called ""page-turner""."
2,So disapointing,"I like Patterson's books, but this one did not cut it for me. It's set up in France, in the Middle Ages; and tells the story of a peasant who embarks in the Crusades to come back to his house -- burned to the ground; his wife missing. He subsequently becomes a Jester to find her, and get her back.While this was written in the usual fast-paced style. I found the story boring.Maybe this time, Patterson write about a world he doesn't master well. Or the main character is just too plain. I don't know.For example, I bought the book because I was looking to be somehow enchanted by the crusades part. It turns out there was no mystery in it -- just blood and guts. While I was hoping for a real adventure; I ended up reading a story that felt too matter-of-fact.I actually could not finish the book . . . too bad!If you want a fun Patterson book, read this one insteadHoneymoon"
3,Good story let down by certain detail at the end,"This book was recommended by a friend who knows I enjoy good, well-researched historical fiction (try Michael Jecks Templar books for an example). I enjoyed it very much until some very far-fetched and historically inaccurate bits at the end. The premise that the king would even contemplate his daughter marrying a peasant I could overlook (as it follows typical Hollywood fiction), but two glaring facts show that the author is no genuine historian. One is the jester writing a letter (at a time when commoners had no schooling), and the second is the mention of the trapdoor when the girl is about to be hanged. This is a very modern invention and shows the Hollywood version of history can be applied to the written word not just to film."
3,Very different than I expected,A different slant on Medieval literature but I was not really drawn in like I was with his other books. I enjoy thrillers and I did not find that it really meets the criteria for that genre. More of a romantic fiction.
1,20th century plot filled in a 11th century bottle,I doubt that any research at all had been done about the 11th century that this book is supposed to have pictured.The plot is too boring and monotonous.I just cannot understand why so many people - judging from the number of reviews - bought this book.Spend your money on Michael Crichton's timeline instead.
2,Reads like a......,"...Steven Spielberg movie script. The characters are 2 dimensional and not developed enough. The ending is too predictable and too ""Hollywood""."
1,"""A Very Weak Effort""","It is apparent that James Patterson must have had little to do with the writing of this book. It is obviously not his style and is written on about a 4th grade level. This is a real shame, since at one time he was a truly powerful literary force. His partner, Andrew Gross, must be working overtime so they can rake in the bucks..........very poor effort."
1,Hated this one,I could not get past the violence--after first 50 pages or so I tossed it... not a book to read given today's world events... only lesson to learn is that we have not yet gotten civilized enough to stop the bloodshed for a holy cause... I have enjoyed all of Patterson's books and picked this one up just for his name.. very disappointed.
3,"Not a great ""historical"" novel","I don't normally like to review books that I know I am going to give less than five stars to, it makes me feel bad! But I am going to make an exception here, because my sister insisted. So here goes.....This was an ""okay"" book. Very fast reading, a good story, but just does not quite make it as a ""good""book. I would not call it a historical novel, although that is what it is described as, I never really felt like I was reading a story from another time period. The story could have been placed anywhere in time and be told the same way. The setting didn't add anything to it. I heard Mr. Patterson talking about all the research he had done, and I don't feel like the reader benefits from that at all!So, read it, maybe from the library, or a friend's copy, maybe even wait for paper."
4,the Jester,"An outstanding book with a little history, romance, and will defined characters. I would recommend this to any reader who enjoys a good book that is a fun read. This book reminds me of 30 and 40s when the good guy show up just in time the rescue the fair maiden."
2,"""Braveheart"" or ""Romeo & Juliet""","Definitely a surprise! I had no idea what I was getting into when I started this book. All I could picture in my mind when the main character ""Hugh De Luc,"" came to be, was Mel Gibson leading his army of common folk in the movie ""Braveheart."" That in conjunction with a ""Romeo & Juliet"" love story, brings you, ""The Jester"". It was a let down for me, especially after Andrew Gross and James Patterson co-authored ""2nd Chance."" In a positive note, the book was very easy reading and the story was easy to follow. In my opinion, this does not fall into the top 5 for James Patterson novels. I love his novels and have read every one of them. This was just a total surprise, kind of like ""Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas,"" a book which I thouroughly enjoyed. I guess I'm just to used to the Mystery and suspense that Mr. Patterson is known for and when a book like this shows up, it is as I stated above, a surprise!"
3,Simply a shameless copying of BRAVEHEART and ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES,"This novel is no more than a shameless copying and ""novelization"" of the movies BRAVEHEART (1995) and ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES (1991). You just cannot help but notice the similarities between the book and the movies. The writers simply merged both movies and changed the names of the characters and some details. After the first half of the book, I knew exactly how it would end. I however give the book credit because of its unconventional use of really short chapters, and it historical overtones that made it much easier to read and consequently quite interesting."
1,I expected more,"When I read the back cover I thought the idea was interesting. A man disguised as a jester to take revenge on a powerful feudal lord. But the writer is not able to create tension or any believable character. It is like we were expecting all the time to the point when we can understand why someone wrote this book.I am not talking about the historical accuracy, probably the writers have done a lot. It is only that we cannot see it, at least I cannot.There is not real adventure on this book. The writers seemed to have wrote the book in a week. Because is so fast...But also there is nothing on it that makes me feel any empathy with the characters. They are all grey. Even the villains are boring.All seems so cliche. Like if you have read this book other thousand times. Nothing new, nothing interesting.A pity because the idea was very good."
1,Threw it in the trash,"I am a Patterson fan, and was looking forward to reading this book. However, this was the grossest book I've ever set eyes on. I found myself skipping whole sections because of the revolting battle images described by the author(s). I'm not a wimp, I see a lot of really gross stuff at work (I'm a nurse), but this was just so over the top that I couldn't finish it. Might be a good tool for those on a diet tho..."
2,An opportunity wasted.,"This book's subject matter had so much potential. Instead, it has been totally wasted. It had a chance to go into detail about the Crusades, relics, siege warfare, French village life, and life in the Courts of France. It seems like it has been dumbed down for eighth graders.Wait for it in paperback."
2,Sappy and shallow,I actually made it throught his whole book. I was not that worked up about the casual nature with which Patterson and Gross treat the historical realities until I actually finished the book and read the acknowledgements which state that they made 'extreme efforts' to be historically accurate. Puke.The book was pretty weak. I agree with one reviewer who likened it to reading a movie script. It moved along at a brisk if unlikely pace with little character development.I found the characters to be ridiculous. Every commoner has a heart of gold and every noble man is a lecherous jerk? Give me a break. Try to offer some complexity. Please.This book received two stars from me only because if you are looking for a brain dead book to read on vacation this fits the bill. It is entertaining and it does move along. Just don't expect great literature.
2,"good premise, poor execution","I was looking for a good history-based novel to read on vacation. What I got was neither good or history-based. The plot is very predictable, the characters talk like 20th century cops, and the whole thing is just too cheesy. A mixture of Robin Hood, Ivanhoe, and Cindarella, with all the charm and novelty stripped away."
3,Adult Robin Hood,James Patterson's brave step away from his normal murder mystery novels (hope Alex Cross will be coming back soon) is in a way a great success on the other a bit tame. The action pieces I feel as though I can actually picture them and the blood and dramatic descriptions are quite gruelling. But I feel Patterson should stick to what he is in my opinion the best murder thriller author around.
3,Not His Best Effort,"I kept waiting for the story to pick up. Instead, it got very repetitive in its action scenes and quite crass when there was no aspparent need other than to add spice to a story that needed something. All in all a disapointment."
1,Page Turner?....more like cure for insomnia,"I'm not sure what book of Mr. Patterson the other reviewers were reading, but ""The Jester"" may just be the book that makes the current ""The Cat Who..."" series read like real mysteries. This book is filled with absolutly no plot, no story line, and its only reason for appearing in print must be that ignorant people will buy anything published by certain authors. If you don't believe that, consider James Michener's last group of ""best"" sellers. Pap is Pap, no matter who writes it."
3,OK but VIOLENT!,"OK is about all I can say about The Jester. I have loved James Patterson's previous novels ( I have a shelf just for him!)and being a Medievalist I was totally anticipating a wonderful book. Sadly, I was disappointed. The violence is almost too much to bare at times. The basic story behind all of the gratuitus violence, rape and murder has promise. But frankly, after wading through the atrocities mentioned I was just trying to make it to the end of the book.If you are an avid fan of James Patterson as I am, go ahead and get the hardback. If not, wait until the paperback or borrow from a friend."
1,desperately seeking a new jester...,"so disappointing! Unlike the other readers, I actually finished the book because it was such a quick read. I was totally unimpressed with the attempt at an historical interpretation of these times. It had the potential to be a fascinating tale. A textbook would have kept me more interested."
3,He is a Brilliant Hack,"This is the second Patterson novel I have read (the first being another co-authored story, ""The Beach House"").I've come to the conclusion that Patterson is the most brilliant literary hack alive. His chapters are short, his pacing lively. If you aren't looking too closely, his plots are exciting and adventure-filled. But once you start looking closely, you begin to see the glaring plot holes and incredibly poor writing evident in every line. The characters are so paper-thin they make teen romances seem deep by comparison.Everything about the writing is just poor. It reads like the first draft of a novel, like he just put down the first words that came into his head, not the final version.But if you don't pay too much attention and are just looking for a fun read on the beach on a lazy summer day (I read The Jester in three days), the book is a lot of fun."
2,Fair,"My apologies to all you James Patterson fans out there. I know I am about to inflame many of you with what I have to say. The truth is, I've read several of his books now and have to say that there just isn't much substance to them. They feel trite and contrived and not particularly clever when compared to other writers in the genre. I always think I should enjoy them but I am always left wondering where the ""rest of it is."" It feels like eating nothing but whipped cream for dinner when you really want a burger. It looks great and sounds like a good idea but you're left wanting something else when you're done."
2,Just Couldn't Like It,"In James Patterson's novel ""The Jester,"" Patterson spins the tale of Hugh du Lac, a village surf who fights in The Crusades, loses his family, becomes a court jester to exact vengence, and eventually leads a battle to win his freedom.I did not care for this novel at all. The dust jacket makes this novel sound like a Grail quest mystery and it really isn't. It's a historical drama about the struggles of one man to exact revenge against those that wronged him. The characters were a bit cookie cutterish, the plot was slow, and the ending was very anti-climactic. Patterson is much better at mysteries and my advice would be for him to stick with what he is good at. ""The Jester"" was just not my cup of tea."
4,The Jester,"This book combines solid historical backdrop and great storytelling ability. The jester, a humble man made great by passion and needs, rises above his own renenge. He shows his townspeople that freedom must be first claimed and then defended.A colorful medival story with love, the crusades, villians, a dwarf and of course a hero."
3,First Stab at Historical,"James Patterson takes his first stab at historical genre with co-author Andrew Gross in a medievial tale set in 11th century where an impoverished inn-keeper Hugh De Luc decides to fulfil his destiny in joining The Crusades to Jerusalem. Patterson's punchy style sets the frenetic pace of the tale and pitches the massacre with action and violence. He arrives back to discover his wife Sophie and son kidnapped by black 'faceless' men. Hugh battles his way in search of his wife and leads the townspeople to revolt against two oppressive dukes. Little did he know that Filled with doses of humour and warmth, Patterson's characters shine with wits and intelligence regardless of the genre. Though the history in the book comes across as fleeting, it is nonetheless an entertaining romp galvanized with energy."
3,I think these authors play too many video games,"While reading this Patterson/Gross novel I felt as though I was playing a video game...I have read all of Mr. Patterson's previous books and totally enjoyed them. This one..not so much. I found it to be almost a child/teen novel. Maybe they flet they could compete with Harry Potter in that venue, but I don't think it works."
2,Boooooring!,"I've listened to two of the eight cassettes in this book, and I've finally decided to stop. I'm too bored to continue. I borrowed it from my library, and there are several people waiting to listen to it. Too bad that I can't warn the other patrons to forget it!"
2,Boring,I usually enjoy Patterson but his one was just not able to hold my interest. It is still sitting here half finished. Maybe one of these days when I run out of reading material I will finish it.
1,Just awful!,Not a Patterson type novel. If youre looking for a Patterson novel for your next flight this is NOT for you. Just awful even for its own lame hole filling genre of quasi historical fiction a la Dan Brown. Just awful!
5,its great,i was surprised when i went to look at the reviews to see that there were many that didnt like this book. i think that most of them are people that like james pattersons thriller mystery stuff. funny thing is that this is the first book by him that ive read. but ive really liked it. its got a great main character. i guess many people that dont like the book are ones that only like to read information about facts. of course im a historical novel buff but i have to have a great story and meaningful characters. and this story has both. so to anyone whos looking to read a book with a lot of heart and wants a cast of characters that have feelings...this is a good one to pick up. please dont listen to the negative reviews of this one. yes the chapters are short...but is that really a reason to judge a book? give it a try i think you will like it. :)
5,outstanding,"I have not read anything else by Patterson, so I am not sure what his fans expect from his work. However, I did purchase this for a long road trip, and was exceptionally pleased. I have listened to it a second time as I did a house reorganization project. I Loved the vivid details that allowed for such a clear picture, and the story was well developed with a thick plot. I have to say this is on the top of my list for all audio books I have chosen for many road trips. I have recommended it to several friends as well."
2,The Jesater is a good joke on Paterson,"The Jester and his court used the ""F"" word many times, and this makes the entire book a big joke. This acronym was not in use until several hundred years later."
4,Modern ideas ancient setting,"I liked this book. I could not put it down, there were times my heart was literally pumping to find out what was about to happen.However, I have to agree with some of the negative reviews here regarding the historical research. I seriously doubt they used ""modern terms"" when cursing and calling names. I can't count how many times the F word is delivered in a totally gratuitous manner.All in all this book WAS a good read, however, I would have been more impressed had the authors spent more time recreating and AUTHENTIC medieval setting. I felt as if they were a couple of gangly pimple faced teenagers throwing the F word in for a grin from their peers. Such attempts were poorly placed, and I was a little embarrassed at the adolescent attempt to curry favor. Such drivel is beyond the level that Patterson has before this time attained.B"
3,"Different, but still good","I was skeptical of the Jester as I started reading it, but I did enjoy the story and it left me wanting more at the end just as his other books have. As others, I was somewhat disappointed that they never went back to ""today"" at the end. One thing I do need to point out is that they never said they found the lance in the jester's grave - it was because of the stories that it was mentioned that it belonged to a jester (it was found in the duke's grave).Also, if you are complaining about 2-3 page chapters, then you are not familiar with James Patterson's books - most of his books are written that way and for me, it keeps me turning pages - you keep saying, ""oh, just one more chapter"", but then you end up reading more."
2,Annoying,"I like historical novels. I had never read a book by this author, but thought I would chance it, given the subject matter. I may never finish it, though, because the writing is awful. The dialogue is especially bad. I would guess that it is written for, or by, an adolescent. Pass it up."
3,Very average book,"The jester is an entertaining book while at the same time extremely forgettable. We follow the Jester Hugh as he tries to lead a revolt against royalty, find true love, and preserve a religious artifact.Every thing about this novel is formula driven and there are no surprises. Even the historical detail wasn't that fascinating because it was so narrow in scope. This story could have been set in the 21st century and it would have worked just as well (with a few modifications). This book is more in-depth that some of Patterson's efforts and the characters aren't as dumb as Alex Cross has become. Read this if you have the time, otherwise, don't."
2,Beach reading when the waves are flat.....,"Noting this book on the NY Times bestseller list, the setting captured my imagination. I sent for a copy and was surprised and disconcerted by the number of modern slang phrases liberally used throughout. The first person pov was well suited to the mood of the story, but he sounded more like a petulant adolescent than a full grown man. The obvious author switch was also jolting, as their styles jog from chapter to chapter scarcely allowing the reader to catch up. I read ""Just Ella"" by Margaret Peterson Haddix right after finishing Jester. I was struck by how much better this juvenile fiction piece was written. It is about what happens to Cinderella after the ball. My advice is to save your money and buy the Haddix book."
4,The Jester is a story about the Crusades (basically).,"This is the first book I've read by Patterson, and it's unlike the others he's written, I'm told. If you like historical fiction, you'll love this book. It's also a page turner! The only thing I didn't like about it was the very graphic descriptions of fighting, killing, murdering, etc. The characters are very memorable and it gives a good insight into what it might have been like to live in the year 1096!"
4,Great Resource,"Great stuff in here. Some of it is WAY over my 4-yr old's head, but I think it will prove to be a great resource over the years to come"
1,"""copy protection"" strikes again","Paid thirty bloody dollars for the two-disc set, received a badly mangled jewel case that appears to have previously been opened (dog-eared booklet) and discs that play on my home DVD player but not on my aftermarket car stereo, presumably because of the ""copy protection"". Didn't dare put the discs into my computer for fear of getting malware installed. Way to go EMI. Returned the set."
5,Great Film - Great Soundtrack CD,"Overlooked and underappreciated by far too many, the film is an excellent satire on the club and music scene, and the soundtrack CD absolutely captures the essence of the film. Disc 1 (Day) is great for relaxing or using as an ambient assist while working (I use it at work in the morning to slowly wind-up). Disc 2 (Night) is one of those rare concept ""sides"" where all the tracks were smoothly blended into each other so what you hear is one long track. It's perfect for a party mix (if you really want to amp it up) -- my wife uses it while exercising and I use it at the office in to combat the afternoon sleepies that usually kick in about 2 - 5 PM. And by the way, the version of the CD we have is NOT copy-protected."
4,Space Saver,"I purchased this phone for my husband and he really likes it. It takes little space and you have everything you need. Phone, Radio, Clock, caller-ID with many features all in one. Was pleased with deliver time and shipping."
4,Just what I needed,I have been needing a new clock radio for quite awhile. I have purchased others that were junk. This is just exactly what I needed. Thank You!!!
5,AT&T Cordless Phone--Thank you!,Phone arrived as advertised. Shipment arrived earlier than expected. Excellent transaction!
5,The Show,"You've heard it all before. All that talk about how this is cracking good electro-pop, it's weird and saucy in a mainstream Euro trashy way, it's one of 2004's best tunes, yada yada yada...and guess what, this reviewer isn't going to lay it on you any different. Do I love it? Yes. Are Xenomania the best damn thing to hit pop music in the past five or six years? Absolutely. Does the whole thing about hanging around the kitchen in their underwear or fluttering their mascara like a butterfly make any sense to me? Not particularly, but do I care? It's got everything you need to make a fantastic track- an unforgiving dance beat, that in-your-face bassline begging you to get that butt shaking, and a series of three or four synth hooks that were kidnapped from the '80s and are being held at ransom to notch themselves straight into your brain. Sophomore slump? I think not."
4,Necessary,The informations shared in this book are simply necessary. It shows you how to deal with people in a professional way. It ads to a person's polish. I insist that my sales team reads it.
2,Waste of Time and Money,The materials in this book are way too basic. They may be good if you are trying to teach your kids. The chapter on going global has inaccurate information. I am returning the book.
3,Overrated,"I was really looking forward to reading this book after going through the Amazon.com reviews for this book. I was really disapointed because much of it is common sense. The author goes on and on about the importance of good etiquette, but you probably wouldn't be reading this book if you didn't know that already.I did learn a few pointers, but not enough to recommend this to anyone."
2,Not what I was hoping for.,"This book gives a surface view of business etiquette, but fails to delve into the true subject. The purpose of etiquette goes far beyond simple courtesy and the ideas behind it are essential for day to day living. I was hoping that this book would focus on specific instances of business etiquette, their histories, and their proper implementation. Instead I was greeted with a laundry list of what to do and what not to do. Blindly following these concepts may get one through a dinner party or two, but without a real understanding of the precepts, a person cannot hope to truly incorporate etiquette into their daily lives or business dealings."
2,Never-Hair refills,Refill cartridges don't fit previously purchased roller of same brand. Not a good situation for us to be in because return is awkward.
5,Pet Hair B-Gone!,"Great product -- the best pet hair remover on the market, ever! With a dog and a cat (white AND black hair) my clothes are covered! This is a great product but it is SOOO expensive. But it takes perhaps 1 sheet of paper rather than the 3-4 sheets the other roller products.If the price came down, I'd sing its praises even more."
2,"Interesting Concept, Lacks Scientific Support","I was recently introduced to IFS by a therapist where I work, so I decided to read more about it. While I find the principles in here to be potentially useful for some clients, I am reluctant to use them due to lack of scientific support for the model. There have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or group studies of any kind comparing IFS to either a wait-list condition, a placebo ""sham"" therapy, or other empirically-supported interventions. I question why I should choose IFS, which hasn't been validated, over another treatment that has been well-validated in the literature when treating clients. Thus, while potentially useful, I am more apt to choose a treatment that has been demonstrated to be useful via standard research protocol. If empirically supported interventions failed, then I may try IFS."
1,Harmful content. Buyer beware!,"Reviews posted here 13 years ago are harming contemporary consumers and need to be deleted by Amazon. One need only Google 'Castlewood' to learn how this book has harmed innocent victims. Unfortunately, there are many similar 'repressed memory therapy' books and methods written since about 1990 that fall into this same category, and the many, many lawsuits against therapists and other providers prove it. Buyer beware!"
1,If i could give it ZERO stars I would....,"You get what you pay for. In this case, junk. It lasted all of 2 days and one use. The wires fell out of the usb connection. Unfortunately for me it was while I was driving down the road on a 4 hour trip and within the first 30 min after leaving the house. I suggest buying something a bit more expensive that will last more than a couple days. Very poorly constructed connections."
3,Not all products are covered.,"Not all products are covered: It is not a full catalogue of lenses and accesories, many are missing. Interesting if you want to build up some bibliography on Nikon products though."
2,Would not buy again,I bought these to replace a set of Redbox Mintex pads that had worn out at ~65k miles. '98 Passat Wagon. I tried to get the same Redbox pads I had and there was a supply issue at the time and none were available for several months. I installed these pads with my first set of new rotors at 95k miles. These pads have now been on for 3k miles. They squealed from day one and still do. I have pulled them several times to add surface treatments behind them and check movement and springs to no avail. They are also FAR dustier than the Redbox and seem to have little performance difference.I would not buy these again.
5,Neighborhood Redevelopment,"I'm a urban transportation planner and just finished reading this book for the first time to a 4th Grade class during Read Across America Day.What a wonderful book. From my standpoint, I want every citizen to read this book. Don't move away, fix your problems."
1,not a book for children,"This book is suitable with adults with its message that ""the devil you know is better than the one you don't know"", but for children it is just scary. The protagonist dreams of a better place, where he doesn't get attacked, and on his journey to the mystical place where there are few problems, he runs into more and more problems, some of them being violent, others of abandonment and betrayal and the pictures going with these scenes are scary for children. The ending of the book is not the fulfillment of the dream, but the return to the beginning, to the problems he knows. Maybe from an adult perspective it makes sense to tackle the problems at hand rather than to dream of escape, but children need the mystical place and a happy ending, which this book certainly doesn't have. The last picture is one of violence.I usually like Dr. Seuss books, but this book got ruined by the message."
2,Boots not up to par!!!,"The overall look and construction are fine; however, when used in wet conditions (as jungle boots are to be used) the material on top of the sole began falling apart right away. It appears to be either a real poor quality leather or even cardboard. Boots were used at the Boundary Waters in Minnesota. Drained well and otherwise held up very well. If you plan to use them one trip these are probably worth the cheap price, but you'll need to put a shoe insert inside increasing the cost some what. If you plan to use multiple times, my U.S. Army issued jungle boots from 1985 held up great, so go the extra expense for regular issue jungle boots."
3,OK,OK Boot that my kids like but I did have several eyelets that needed to be redone with my leather press. Bad QC.
3,Flexible and appears comfortable,"I bought this for my rottweiler. The I purchased the largest size available (9) and it fits him, but just barely with the strap all the way out. Having the dimensions of each size listed would be helpful. He is a big dog but I don't see this fitting a mastiff or a great dane etc."
4,tree-like alien tries to take over earth,"when a creature from outer space resembling a mutant tree craves world domination it does so by turning people into plant monsters (three types the sailor a fly-like creature that acts as a scout,the tumbler a furry plant thing turns into a thorny ball and the shooter a two legged no armed plant beast that takes over peoples minds or turns them into other shooters) and by using the residents of an oterwise quiet town to germinate more plant creatures the only ones who can stop it are a man returning to the town a unbalenced mad scientest a young cop and two teenaged girls"
1,S$%T PEOPLE!,Pathetic rip-off of Invasion of the Body Snatchers aboutseedpods from outer space possessing people in a remoteCalifornia valley-sound familiar? Yet another Charles Bandbummer! I swear My Dinner with Andre had better specialeffects!
1,So bad you gotta see it!!!,Giant seeds from outer space invade the Earth!!! Their method of domination? ROLLING!!! Cuddle up with a can of Round-Up and prepare to laugh your *ss off at how horribly bad this horror film is! :)
3,"An engaging read with action, originality, and humor.","This book is a good, engaging read, without the sometimes- overwhelming depth of Stirling's ""5th Millenium"" books. In a well-fleshed out, approximately Renaissance-level setting, a well-to-do rancher's daughter, a disgruntled army officer, a lawyer who's more than he seems, and an exotic catwoman are thrown together on a quest for a power object which can defeat an evil tyrant. They're helped along the way by a hilarious near-forgotten fertility god, and hindered by a villainous comrade who has dire plans of his own for the rancher girl and her family. This book has a plausible, imaginative setting and strong, believable female characters on both sides of the struggle. This isn't a wildly original, groundbreaking work, but it's a well-constructed, satisfying read."
2,That foam thing.....,"....will pull your hair out! Kinda defeats the purpose. Dark brown is too dark, medium brown is too light. That's my own problem, I guess. Putting this stuff on wet like you're supposed to is an absolute pain -- not to mention a gross mess. I gave up on it. Doesn't go on dry like they say it will."
2,not so great,"the color is way off. i have dark brown hair w/ even darker roots and the dark brown color i ordered looks like dusty, blackish grey in my hair. it comes off quite easily, it is not water proof. i prefer eye shadow to this product."
2,Not worth the 40 something dollars.,I used Couvre for years which is a paste in a tube. Dermatch is a dry disc. You wet the applicator and rub it on the disc. The small applicator makes it difficult to get good coverage. I found if you use foam wedges that you can get at any makeup counter they provide better coverage. Couvre provides such a wedge. I wanted to try Dermatch because of some of the good reviews and the fact it should last 6 months or more. The Couvre lasts me maybe 2 months but is much cheaper also. I'll use the Dermatch in a pinch when I'm out of my other product but won't spend the 40 plus dollars on it ever again. In my opinion it's not worth the price for the coverage it provides. Also when my hair dries it's a little lighter where the Dermatch got onto my hair providing a slight difference in color from the covered area and non covered area. I really don't care for that feature. The paste Couvre does not do that. I'll stick with my old standby. No more Dermatch for me.
2,Like shoe polish,Have you ever seen those bald guys that try to cover up a spot with makeup and it looks really fake...well this is what that reminded me of. The dark brown was more like black and it just didnt look good. I could tell it was there and anyone within 5 feet of me could tell too. I returned this and bought Toppik. Toppik isnt make-up it's an actual fiber. When I shook the can onto the bathroom sink (just to see what it looked like) it looked like my boyfriend had left little hairs after shaving. Buy Toppik with the spray!
1,This thing has defeated me!,"Picked this up at a local hardware store and haven't been able to use it yet... For the life of me I can't figure out how this thing opens to get the batteries in!! As the positive reviewer notes, it's solid unibody and fairly sturdy. I should know, I've twisted, bent, pried and pulled every little section of this thing short of yanking the wire out of the bottom.Frankly it's embarrassing! I'm the guy people usually ask to figure stuff like this out, and believe me, I read the scant instructions it came with. Maybe I lost the little slip of paper with the magic word on it... I'm tempted to take a hacksaw to this thing just to uncover whatever mechanism I'm supposed to unlatch, then buy another one once my dissection has paid off.If you get this, be SURE to look for stray slips of paper when you open it! Or buy an extra you can smash open with a hammer to get to its insides.If you already have this, HELP!"
1,Practical work use on the job.,The light bulb cannot be replaced in the device due to device design. When the light bulb stops working the device can only be tossed in the trash.
1,A very bad book,Perhaps the worst alternate history book ever written. It is poorly written and the help provided by the time travelers is much more than it would be possible to provide.
4,Riso & Riso!,I'm a big fan of Rick Riso from waaaay back! I had to get a copy of this to add to my library of his work!
5,This is a great book,MacDonald really made a great book! This book is about a 19th century irish girl who wants independence from her mother and father. So she goes off to Sweden on her own. In the end she finds romance. This is one of the best books I've read. Finally a romance where the woman is not a lovestruck doll.
3,TELEMANN : Die Donnerode 1756 & Der Herr ist Konig 1720,"Track listing: Der Herr ist König, TWV 8:6[1]. Die Donnerode, TWV 6:3[2].Ann Monoyios[1], Barbara Schlick[1,2], sopranos; Axel Köhler, alto[2]; Wilfried Jochens, tenor[1,2]; Harry van der Kamp[1], Hans-Georg Wimmer[2], Stephan Schreckenberger[1,2], basses; Hermann Max conducting the Rheinische Kantorei and Das Kleine Konzert.As with Der Tag des Gerichts (search Catalogue for 10413) there is a Fanfare review on Tom Moore's homepage at Princeton.Faster tempos than Hickox and Collegium 90 on Chandos, and the second ""filler"" piece is a premiere recording. [timing 65'28]"
4,Unknown Gems,"From listening to this, we now know why Bach respected his friend Telemann greatly. Bach transcribed ""Der Herr ist Koenig"" for his own use in Leipzig; and the Donnerode conveys its text quite well.Unfortunately for Telemann, many of his compositions, cantatas included, come across as rather routine. However, in his enormous output, there is much to be appreciated. His style is an interesting mix of the influences that affected Bach and Handel."
1,dumb,regret we bought this. Got it for thanksgiving day sale and it sucks.....guess we will just think twice and read reviews before purchasing next year!
3,3 Stars for CG.....,"I truly enjoy the remake of CLASH OF THE TITANS.....However, I did not enjoy this Wrath of the Titans as well as I did Clash.....To my opinion, the movie had no strong story line....The only thing good about the movie which also has a lot of bad acting.....is the CG...They were great....I would rent before buying the disc."
1,Wrath of a movie lover,"This movie just proves that some people will watch anything... just throw a lot of bright colors, movement, and loud noises together and watch the money roll-in! The reason Hollywood keeps putting out utter garbage like this is because we keep paying to see it. I really have to stop letting my friends drag me to watch this visual vomit."
2,Shallow Story Line,The story line was incredibly shallow and did not make me intrigued at all. This made all the scenes seemed forced and therefore less entertaining.
3,A movie that could have so much more.,"This movie has awsome special effects, good picture quality, crisp sound, and it is better than Clash of the Titans, but like Clash of the Titans the storyline could have been alot stronger. To me this movie gets a passing grade is do to the special effects, which are really cool. I wish that they went deeper into the actual story and plot. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves their special effects. I give it a solid C."
5,excellent,THIS IS MUCH BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL. LIAM NEESON SHOULD GET AN OSCAR. THE SPECIAL AFFECTS ARE AWESOME. A VERY INTERTAINING MOVIE WHICH WILL BECOME A CLASSIC.
3,Not too surpricing!!,"The movie turned out to be somewhat like the first one, it is entertaining if you are looking for some SiFi action."
5,Loving it!,This combo is the best as it includes the 2D and 3D versions of the movie. The plot is predictable but the effects are amazing. A real pop corn thriller. I love the ultraviolet version for mobile viewing! Nice!
3,"Was not to impressed, the first was way better","It was ok, nothing like the first one. Don't wast your time or money on this show. If you want to watch a good show just re-watch first one."
2,forgettable and only if its free,I'm writing this review 2 weeks after watching the movie and I can't remember a thing. It had okay action at best. I used a discount code to get it so not that big of a loss.
4,good movie for a 12-year old boy,"good movie. The first time my 12-year old watched it on TV with his older cousin, he got nightmare. But he couldn't help wanting to watch it again.I consider it is okay."
3,Could have been better.,Great cast who was poorly used with weak dialogue and script. Special effects strong but little sense about why I should care about the protagonist or his adversaries. Mildly entertaining yet throw away piece of popcorn fluff if you have a couple of hours to waste.
2,not worth it,"Very disappointed in the movie, never saw a movie that could not keep my attention until this one. I do not recommend this movie to anyone-sorry."
4,From a Woman's Perspective,"As an adult woman I didn't think think this was a great movie--but it's great for my kids!The character of Andrometa is a perfect Princess Leia-type roll-model. FEMININE AND STRONG (not a man-hating who-needs-you feminist or bitchy Xena).I liked the messages of Forgiveness and the power of Father-Son relationships.In the first Titans movie there's was anger and rebellion towards Father-Figures. Also, Rape, Infanticide, Nudity. I appreciate the movie-makers tapping into the fact that a lot of kids were interested in this type of movie, just as we adults were in the older version when we were growing up.I will be definitely be purchasing this sequel movie for my kids."
4,My kind of movie,I was concerned that the second one wouldn't live up to the first but it did. I really enjoy this type of movie so I always walk in to the theater with high expectations and I wasn't disappointed.
4,A Sequel that is superior to the original!,"I wasn't a huge fan of the remake of CLASH OF THE TITANS. I believed the Harryhausen version told the same story in a slightly better way--and I thought the CGI monsters lacked the life of Harryhausen's stop-motion examples.This film, then, took me by surprise. First, the storyline really does work--building on the characters and ideas of the first film and following through with the main theme of the death of the Gods.The effects work is also superior--with more weight and depth than the previous film. The fact that it was actually filmed in 3-D and not retrofitted also means that the picture is brighter and sharper. A fun film to watch with some nice action."
3,a ok,Thought it would have more action but it's still an ok movie i would recommend it to watch. Maybe there will be another one.
3,Just ok.,"Good special effects, good cgi, weak plot and acting, but I didn't watch it to be blown away. For what it is, it is just ok."
3,soso,Movie was so so. I think the plot was interesting and slightly different than the first movie. The ending was interesting.
2,Great movie,"The movie is great, as you can see by my review on the 3d Blu-Ray edition. This Instant Video came with the purchase of the movie. The restriction on when you could watch the movie made it impossible for me to take advantage of it. I have seen it on my iPad through the digital copy. If the restriction was not there, I may have enjoyed having this for free."
4,Good movie,Pretty good movie. Wrath of the Titans is a really good movie. Better than I expected it to be. Was pleased.
3,Just ok,I thought the acting was just ok. I didn't care for the fact his wife died right in the beginning but the story line was fine. I enjoy movies from this genre.
3,"Actors are great, script not so much","I think they went in the wrong direction with this one. It wasn't nearly as good as the other movies. It was okay with some action, but also some clumsy story lines and plots. Things any idiot could see coming a mile away the great Zeus couldn't see? A rental that's about it not worth buying for me anyway."
4,Good Sequel,This is a good action film. It follows the exact same patternas the first and so is a good sequel.
3,Almost,"The acting was good. The special effects were great. The story was hard to follow. It seemed like they cut out some key scenes and dialogue along the way. It was overall entertaining, but not one I'll remember or want to see again."
4,PaulBrie,"I thought is was very good and entertaining, we love this type of movie action adventure types.. please make more of these movies we like dragons too!"
4,Epic Movie,"Wrath of the Titans is an awesome movie. I believe it was better than the remake of Clash of the Titans, which is a good movie but not as good as this one. Enjoy!"
4,Awesome Special Effect .A must be watched for fans of Class of the Titians movies,5 stars for Special Effect .4 Stars for Story. 3 stars for Acting and directing . Adding for your collection of Class of the Titans movies if you are a fan and just enjoy the movie because it's better than lots of movies out there in the past and present .I watched this movie on Blu-Ray and DVD not on Amazon Instant Video .I received my order on time and the packing is good. Shipping fast with free shipping .
3,Fun Action but not as good as the first/remake,"The special effects were great, I enjoyed the nod to Bubo the mechanical owl from the Original. BUt the story wasn't as good as either of the first movies.Decent popcorn flick, but not expect too much."
4,Good Sequel,"The movie was good for what it is. It's not supposed to be a thought provoking drama, it's supposed to be a fun entertaining movie...and that it is. Great special effects, and good acting."
5,awesome,Love the mythology. I wish there were more movies out there like this one. My wife is a huge fan of these. Go figure
2,Movie froze to often to finish,I could not finish this movie because it kept freezing. The last several times I have rented a movie from Amazon they all have frozen.
3,just ok,I would give it 2.5 stars. Somewhere between I don't like it and it's ok. It's just a typical sequel.
1,Warning,"Warning! I bought the combo pack. The DVD has a copy-protection called ""Cinavia"" which renders it unplayable on my Sony Blu-Ray player. Thus, buying the DVD of this or any movie with ""Cinavia"" is a waste of money. I can play the DVD on another, older DVD player, but apparently some Blu-Ray machines, plus PS3 machines will not play these Cinavia movies. There is no way to know if your Blu-Ray player will play a Cinavia-protected movie until you shell out your money, open it up and try to play it. At that time, no store will refund your money as the package has been opened. Be careful and do a search for movies with Cinavia and avoid them like the plague---else you will be wasting your money to this scam."
2,Rushed Sequel,"Can't believe this movie cost 150 million dollars.The only good thing was the mythological creatures.Too much talking and not enough action.Not even Fiennes and Neeson can save this movie.There was some fighting scenes with weapons and they were badly edited with too many quick,close up cuts.Save your money and if you're curious to watch it.Wait for the dvd.Only good performances were from Toby Kebell which was the comic relief."
1,No More Ultraviolet,"Since this is only Ultraviolet, I WILL NOT recommend nor purchase. If there is no other digital copy choice, I choose not to participate. I don't want another forum I must sign into to watch a movie I have purchased."
1,wow this moviw was...,"What a horrible sequal. A hollywood blunder, bad acting, bad plot, no movement. Just Bad!Most of the actors phoned this one in. They should have put nicholas cage in there too. Choko, fromDomino, was a horrible choice for Aries. It lacked too much to list. And Kronos, what was that. what about theother titans."
2,Hollywood needs to give special effects budgets to writers,"The special effects were great - too bad about the story. As it stands, this movie is all glitz and no real substance."
5,great movie,great movie I liked it better then the first would recommend it to all who likes this tip of movie
2,Not So Hot,"We love Liam, but as much as the family wanted to enjoy this movie, it was just lacking... something (we all agreed). Because it is Part II to Clash of the Titans, most of you will eventually watch it out of dedication. If for nothing else your OCD will get the better of you as if it were unfinished business. All I can say is, don't say I didn't warn you. Personally I'd wait until it is released on cable."
3,First one was better,"The first movie was better, the story line was put in place just to make a another movie, was not that great."
5,Christmas Presents,I purchased this version of Wrath of the Titans for one of my other sons who prefers this version to the older oversion. He seems to think it is a better made movie than the earlier movie.
5,Wrath of the Titans,I thought I had already reviewed this product. I love the movie.I hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.
3,Pretty Good Movie,"I liked this movie and if I could have figured out how to give it 3 1/2 stars I would have. I'm such a fan of the original Clash of the Titans with Harry Hamlin that unfortunately I compare him to Sam Worthington who has the personality of a rock.Anyway, if you're in the mode for a good 'ol dose of mythology, this is a good fare."
4,Premise of Movie a bit of a Reach!,"I rated it a three out of five since the movie felt and played again like the first one.Amazon delivery of the movie was excellent on my Blue Ray Sony player. I had great success with this video service on my Roku, too. Sam Worthington is fun to watch in an adventure movie, but the script seemed like a repeat. The explosions at the end where fantastic even though it seemed ridiculous for the armed forces to be fighting out in the middle of nowhere in particular. Didn't most armies fight over something tangible like a town or city? UGH!!!! Though the army Queen seemed very much at home in this type of movie."
3,Strange but entertaining,Movie was good if you suspended belief and by that I mean don't even try to make sense of Greek mythology and how it relates to the events and portrayals of characters in this movie. But outside of that it was entertaining.
3,not as good as the first movie,"Then movie was okay, but not nearly as good as the first one. It does make for a good rainy day movie though :-)"
3,Titans film...,This movie was alright... It had its let downs but it was still a nice way to wrap up a long day. It was visually beautiful and the plot was not too out there. Considering the crap Hollywood is turning out these days this film does not rate a flush in my opinion. Its a good movie.
2,A true example of lazy film making,"The citizens of ancient Greece spoke with a mish mash of Australian, Cockney, and english accents apparently. i know this was probably going to be trouble when in interviews the star went on and on about how he was allowed to grow his hair out for the role. No one really mentioned story or characterization in six pages of interviews. So I went in expecting a thin story and a fun ride. little did I know it was a ride to Hades by way of the river Crap. They somehow managed to make a thinner story than they did in the Clash of the Titans remake. It feels less story and more like a rough draft of the first story outline."
1,Fake Blu-Ray,"Dude i rated this 1 star. 1st of all you sent Blu-Ray Case but obviously the disc wasnt Blu-Ray. It was a straight up DVD and not only that but you could see the recording. I know Im all late telling you this, but i just wanted to let you know dude. By the way the you could tell the title of the disc was imprinted on it cause you can even scratch it off"
1,wrath of the titans!,little needs to be said here! Crappy movie!Poorly written! Waste of time! Excuse for people to waste money!Do not rent!Money flushed away!Not much more time should be wasted reviewing this bad movie!
2,Wrath of the ... Immortals is better,this movie is not expected to great since the last one was not well made. So if you like movies of people walking around in 3-D (sounds awesome i know right...) then get it.
3,"Too much wrath, and too much death...","** SPOILER ALERT **Being a fan of the first Clash of the Titans movie starring Sam Worthington, I had high hopes for this installment. It's full of hate and betrayal, which you get immediately. Zeus, Neptune and Aries try to meet with Hades in the Underworld, and he betrays them and makes a deal with his father, Kronos. After that, the movie becomes very depressing. The only thing I can say about the rest of the movie is that almost everybody dies except for Perseus and Andromeda. If you want to be depressed, this is the movie for you!The acting is very good, but is hampered by a weak and disjointed storyline."
1,ANNIMATED CLASH OF THE TITAN,absolute crap. The animation is not old school its just down right clumsy. The story line is weak. I had to watch it over several sittings to get through it. And if you want bad audio this is definitely for you.
5,Great Action Flick,"When you have three amazing actors - Liam Nesson (Zeus), Ralph Fiennes (Hades) , and new comer Sam Worthington (Perseus) , well it's hard to beat this gem. Yes, the lines might be a bit corny but who cares really, with all the kick but actions scenes! It was not disappointing in the least and worth to add to your movie collection."
4,"Blu-ray Review: ""Wrath of the Titans""","After my utter disappointment in the ""Clash of the Titans"" remake, I didn't know what to think of its sequel. I felt like I could be a bit more forgiving of ""Wrath of the Titans"" because it was a sort of fresh start unlike the senseless retooling that was its predecessor.Thankfully, ""Wrath of the Titans"" did provide haters of the remake a jumping-on point to give this new tale of Perseus a chance. I choose to think of this movie as a sequel to the original 1981 movie. I know it seems ridiculous, but it's what I have to do to come to grips with this follow-up.The ""Wrath of the Titans"" Blu-ray is a worthy purchase for fans of Greek mythology and fantasy films. The movie itself is a step above the ""Clash of the Titans"" remake. It's full of action and the special effects are effective. A healthy amount of extra features, some hosted by Neeson and Worthington, will please consumers and add value for buyers."
5,Great Steelbook!!!!,I ordered my Wrath Of The Titan 3D Steelbook from Best Buy and payed 30 bucks or so. It is amazing how it looks. I give it a 10++++ the disc art suck because it doesnt have any but the case makes up for it. it amazes me how much people want alot for something that is still in print. I do recommend getting it from Best buy dot com (much cheeper)
2,Dreadful & disappointing,"I must say I was extremely disappointed with the is movie, it was, at best B grade and poorly acted with a wishy washy story line, no more Titan sequels for me!"
4,Wrath of the Titans,"This is the second classical mythology film starring Sam Worthington that I have seen and now own. Being a student of classical mythology and Greek culture in general I am somewhat biased towards films of this genre. While the interpretation of Greek mythology is a "" bit of a stretch "" I thoroughly enjoyed the action and the stolid but believable chracterization by Sam Worthington. The film does rely heavily on special effects but all in all I enjoyed the story. I hope that there is a another one to follow. Joe Turner"
3,As mediocre as Clash of the Titans,Clash (of the Titans) had more exciting action scenes (especially the climax against the Kraken) though I think Wrath (of the Titans) had more total minutes of action.At least in this film Perseus complains less about being a half-god and his destiny to save mankind.
2,Leave the myths alone,"Though I did enjoy much of the action and the general look of the film, I was constantly telling myself ""it's just a movie."" Each time the story altered the mythology for the movie's sake was a distraction...and it was often. I'm accustomed to the practice of combining characters and events to shorten a story to fit into a film's time frame. But, this film (and it's sequel) went beyond saving time. They couldn't even get Pegasus right. Perhaps they should have taken a look at the Harry Hamlin film as a reference. Pegasus is the name of a single flying horse, not a type of animal. The writers must have been D&D players who also didn't know the difference. Next time I want to watch the story I'll watch the 1981 version. It's fun with fewer distractions."
2,The Wrath of Watching a Bomb,"I was terribly disappointed, shocked in fact that this sequel with its star cast could be so awful. Thrilled I didn't go see this at the theater, I would have been steaming upset. It's not worth the current price to pay on Amazon either, wait till it's free. At least you won't be upset with yourself that you spent money on this, just be upset that you bothered to waste your time. Oh well, you've been warned."
2,"Crap of the Titans - By the Gods, this is bad!","A bombastic, 3-D fantasy sequel like this can normally be expected to have a throwaway script favoring computer animation and motion-capture creatures, but this takes lifeless moviemaking to new lows. Did the first movie even generate enough boxoffice to greenlight this kind of rehash project? The single-daddy demigod bit is laughable from the get go, but there's plenty of body-slamming action and noise pollution to keep you from nodding off. Worthington hasn't the presence to carry a peplum potboiler like this, while Neeson, Fiennes and Nighy are compellingly wasted. The muzak sounds like judgement day."
3,"Great movie, didn't state movie format","I love this movie, wasn't happy that my blue ray player couldn't play it at all only my computer what the heck!"
4,The Titans on Blu Ray,I rated this product with 4 stars because I love the movie and I love Blu Ray. And yet more than that I love the way Blu Ray looks every time I watch a movie. Now the reason I chose this particular movie to watch in Blu Ray is due to the epic nature and action of this film.
3,Worth watching,Wanted to watch this for awhile it was definitely worth it. Action gods and the little guy saves the day
3,ok Movie,"The movie was ok, story was weak. The first one was alot better. I don't think I would watch this one again."
2,Not great,"I am a great fan of Greek mythology, but the second movie in this series, like the first, is not great. Given the special effects and the writers available today, it's truly sad that the producers couldn't come up with a better story."
1,Disappointing!,To much hype for an overall not well put together movie!1 star if any! I'm glad I didn't see it at the movies
2,Waste of these actors,"Not as fun as the first one, many ""why did they do that?"" moments. While the effects are mostly great (kind of iffy on the cyclops), the acting is not there, a talented cast is wasted, teams are just thrown together, and what could be mindless popcorn entertainment just seems a waste."
2,Snooze fest,Terrible sequel. It was almost like the actors didn't feel like acting. Some of the action and special effects were okay but I was disappointed overall. I'm struggling to remember one thing that I did like ... and I cannot. I hope they don't bother with another one.
1,Based on the original viewing......,"I loved this movie. However...they will not sell THE NORMAL DIGITAL COPY. CAN'T EVEN RENT IT. (This reminds me of an old saying: ""Another way to ruin a movie income: ""PLAY GAMES WITH WOULD BE BUYERS!"""" Hear that? I rented the first time....just to see it. And was ready to buy the digital copy.!!!!???????Hello....Money to make here....When and if it does come to amazon instant video, I refuse to rent/purchase any rights to it.They let us rent/purchase this video here on amazon when it was new/PREVIEWING. Now because we liked it and gave it a good review...they have stripped it from digital viewing or purchase.This and this alone grants this movie a review as: hollywood money making garbage. Pure hollywood garbage.I would have purchased digital when I had the chance. We showed them in previewing it was good...Gave our honest opinions? Now this...C'mon........C'MON...........c'mon......c'MON!"
4,Liked it,"Though I'm wasn't a fan of the Clash of the Titans remake, this one surprised me and I liked it alot. Great story"
5,wrath of the titans,"it was great to watch again, I remember watching it years ago and it's still as great as ever. I would recommend it to anyone to buy."
3,My rating,"wouldn't pay to see this again, but would see it on regular television, if nothing better was playing. would not recommend it too a adult."
5,Awesome!,I'm not sure why this movie doesn't get higher reviews. It's very well made with a great storyline. I highly recommend you watch this movie.
3,Just like to follow up on the sequel,"The movie was just that ...Ok, I wasn't all that thrill as I was with the first. It's only because I have the first movie that I bought the sequel."
2,far beyond my tolerance,"Since I knew the director is Jonathan Liebesman (Battle: Los Angeles), i had low expectation on this film. The result is within my consideration."
4,Wrath of The Titans = 3D,Excellent 3D effects throughout this movie. We also have the sequel and it's just as good as the first one. I would recommend this movie to my friends who like the movies about the ancient Gods of Greece!
5,Loved It!,"Other than some of the fast dialogue and mainly colorless/gloomy scenes, the whole story was good. If you're a Sci Fi or mythical age fan, then you'll dig this one."
3,Got me ready to sleep,Not bad as these go. Production values very good. Acting average. Perseus as a reluctant hero is a little odd.
5,Wrath Of Titans,Love the movie and into these type of Greek Myth stories. Came in excellent packaging and works great and service and time was excellent on receiving it. :)
3,The New Titans,I like Sam Worthington as an actor. His Terminator role was terrific. He does a good job in this film but I have seen several versions of this story played by other actors.
1,I Spent How Much????,Can't believe I spent my hard earned money on this movie...I wish I could see the manager and ask for my money back!!! Only saving grace is the popcorn and soda I had watching it didn't cost me $20. Spend your money on the Dollar Menu at your local fast food joint...it will be a much better buy!
1,Goes on and on and on and on...,"This movie creators just wanted to add a second movie to the first one, just because. It wasn't a good idea at all! They totally bombed on this one!The first one ""Clash of the Titans"" was good and well-made, but this one had a fading plot, HORRIBLE acting, and a never ending story.They should have just ended the first one the way it was and not have added a second one like this, because it was a waste of money, time, and just energy of everyone who helped make it and everyone watching it."
2,2 Stars due to UltraViolet,I love the movie the 2 stars is due to yet again another terrible UltraViolet that can not be imported into my Itunes Movie Library. Wow I can stream it...sorry all but again the movie was amazing and I also loved the first and hope their is a 3rd. But when you sell a digital copy 95% of the customers want it for their apple products so let's stop trying to make these digital copies that don't do what customers want. Digital Copy = Itunes
3,Good and Forgettable,"Well, I saw the movie, was amused, and then it was forgotten. A cinematic one night stand. I liked the first one better."
4,Great for 3D Veiwing,"This was a great 3D movie for people who are just getting into watching 3D, a lot of spectacular shots"
2,boring,"loved the original clash of the titans - hated the remake. still, i had high hopes for this movie. special effects were good but the story dragged and was bland at best. very disappointed."
2,A bleak sequel,"I grew up with the original Clash of the titans with stop-motion clay puppets. And that version was immensely better than the prequel of this movie with the same title.This could have been so much more. I just felt... empty. Bleak. Devoid of story, character and even a decent SFX budget."
4,Good movie,Good action movie. Made me remember what i learned in high school about the gods and goddesses. Highly recommend this movie for those looking for action.
4,Better than some people say,"If you are looking for a lot of great acting and dialogue, you'll probably be disappointed. But if you like Greek mythology, especially the mythical creatures like Chimera, Cyclops, etc., and a lot of action, I think you will really like this movie. The special effects are very well done and the sound on the blu ray is very rich and full. The high definition picture quality is also very crisp and clear. I really enjoyed the scenes of Tartarus and Kronos. The only thing I think this movie was missing was some beautiful and scantily clad Greek maidens. But other than that, if you like Greek mythology I think you will really like this movie. Get it on blu ray though."
1,wrath?,"If you must have this dvd, wait till it is on the bottom of one of those $2 barrels at walmart, wont be a long wait."
2,Wrath of the Titans,"This movie was a disappointment. Defineately does not measure up to the first. On the plus side, it had lots of cool special affects. I could not thing of anything else that impressed me."
2,added nothing to the older version,This is a remake that shouldn't have been done. While the special effects were better the story is essentially the same and the acting is no better. If an HD version of the 80's movie were available I'd recommending watching that instead.
5,OH TO BE THERE!,HOT GUYS SAVING THE DAY WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR! BROTHERLY LOVE PREVAILS! GOOD! GREAT AWSOM!! LOVED IT! SMILE
4,A much better sequel,I watched the clash of the titans with huge hopes and I have to say it disappointed me quite a bit. However the sequel was much better in almost all aspect. It might not have been the best movie but it was well worth my time watching it.
2,Bad movie,"Nothing wrong with the disk, seller is good. But the movie itself is bad and actors didnt help to make you enjoy the movie"
3,I thoughty this was the first one in the series,"I thoughty this was the first one in the series. I still need to buy Clash of the titans. Anyway I don't have a 3D blu ray player yet, so I can't comment on that yet. I watched the Blu ray 2D disk. Looked and sounded fine to me. The movies was pretty good. I've only seen parts of this and the first one on broadcast tv and wanted to see the whole movie."
3,Another summer popcorn movie,"I rented this from Amazon Video on Demand. So we return to ancient Greece and continue the Gods struggle for power. We get fast moving battles and get to see the mythincal creatures the franchise is known for. The labrynth is really well done, though some of the CGI moves too fast on the small screen.The movie had enough of a story for a summer spectacle, though I'm not certain why the character that built the labrynth decided to die when he did, its the only scene that was kind of jarring when I was watching the movie. Clearly if he went inside with the other characters it would be too easy to find out where they were supposed to go, but his death still wasn't handled well despite the demands of the story. If that's the only thing complaint I have from a 2 hour movie that's not too bad."
3,Titans,"This is just a typical action type movie it was good though, I liked it. I also liked Clash of the Titans."
2,We didn't even finish watching this . . .,". . . that's how bad it was. Special effects sucked, story wasn't any good and even Sam Worthington couldn't save this movie from drowning."
3,This movie was worth watching.,"This movie was not anything special, but it was not bad either. If you liked the remake of CLASH of the Titans, then you will likely enjoy this one as well."
3,Not the original.,"It was an okay movie. Not as much action as the original, and kind of slow as well. Still enjoyed."
3,"Three and a half stars, was hyped for it, but could have been better","My first impressions were that this would be a blockbuster and solid movie. I was wrong. It was okay. There should have been more direct fighting between Kronos and Zeus/Hades. Perseus basically flies on a horse with wings, throws the spear into the depths of Kronos and the movie is basically over at that point. Zeus has no strength left and dies. Movie could have been much better. It had potential, but failed to deliver."
3,ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE!,"Awesome special effects don't always make a movie great. Such is the case for WRATH OF THE TITANS, the sequel to the remake of CLASH OF THE TITANS. The storyline, thin as it is, focuses on demi-god Perseus' attempt to rescue his deity daddy from the clutches of Hades, Ares and the fiery Kronos. The film's pacing is good, but I wish there had been a few more monsters! The film manages to include the mechanical owl Bubo from the original 1982 Clash...its brief but cleverly used.A collection of talented actors are given little to work with but nobly acquit themselves: Sam Worthington, Edgar Ramirez, Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Bill Nighy, Toby Waddell and Rosamund Pike.The climactic showdown with Kronos must be spectacular in 3-D which I am not fortunate enough to possess.WRATH is passable testosterone entertainment...you could do worse! Or better!"
3,Somewhat satisfied,I would have prefered to go and view this DVD at the movie theater but did not get a chance now I see maybe I made the right choice. The movie was good but did not live up to my expectations.
2,Wrath of the Titans,"After The Clash of the Titans, this fell into the Sequell curse. I loved the first one, which killed the second one."
3,Not as good as the first,"This movie was decent, I enjoy action and effects so it was worth watching but not nearly as good as the first!"
2,"Movie was good, quality was horrible.","I thought paying extra for HD would be worth it, but it was not. The show was so pixelated it was awful to watch. Netflix shows better, without HD or the extra cost."
4,Wrath of the Titans - not quite as good as Clash of the Titans.,"We enjoyed the first one (Clash of the Titans) better, but the Wrath of the Titans was still good. My teenage boys (13 and 15 yrs old) thought it was great fun."
3,Nothing to brag about but enjoyable enough.,"Story is solid and special effects are great; dialogue is awkward at times, but overall this is a good ""movie night"" at home with friends and family flick. So get the popcorn and sweets and enjoy!"
2,Crappy movie. Great fire demon battle at the end.,"Badly put together, just like the original. A movie with a bunch of great actors saying corny dialogue amidst expensive special effects. Loved the final battle with the rock demon, though."
2,Great effects....bad movie,"Why didn't Hollywood learn from ""Clash""? It was awful and so was this one. I'm not referring to the 80s stop-motion classic BTW."
2,WRATH OF THE SPECTATORS,"After the remake of the first movie, I was expecting a little more from this sequel.I mean, really, with the power of 3-D creation available today, why make a creature such as the ""hydra"" so ugly in this movie?Killing off the girl before the sequel even starts? What the hell?!?I paid to see this in a theater, and viewing it once was more then enough.This one is a RENTAL at best..."
1,wrath of the titans,"Save your money and time on this one,it is the worse movie I've seen in many years of watching movies and I've seen a lot of movies,I'm not even going to describe it because is not worth it,take my advise."
1,worst movie ever,wow that was so bad. I hated the 8 mins i saw more then words can discribe. I dont even want the 8 mins of my life back. I'd rather just forget that happened.
3,Travel in style,3 1/2Bit of drop-off in the second half but that doesn't dismiss an often crisp interplay with several important things to say.
1,Don't buy this book!!,"This is the most useless book I ever bought! The content is too simple for my high school kid. Not just simple, it is cheating. It does not contain any meaningful review of high school math as the title suggests."
2,Doesn't work as good.,"Brought this wand thinking that it would reach higher but all it did was drip all over. Disconnected it and am using the one that the pressure pump came with. Maybe I used it wrong but don't see how, its so simple to connect."
3,good multipurpose dictionary,"I am hosting a Ukrainian exchange student and have found that this book is pretty good at interpreting what I want to say. There are no phonetics, so unless you know Ukrainian (which I do not), you need to point out the translation and let them comprehend. The dictionary is ""missing"" a lot of words you may find helpful, but it is much better than nothing and the price is certainly in the right spot. So, I would reccommend it to most people."
4,Blu-ray Blacklisted?,"I have a simple question. Why is this movie not available on blu-ray? It includes a first rate cast, exceptional acting and plot development and a message that crosses racial boundaries. I also note that the Amazon description fails to list the names of any of the central cast. Guess they all look alike so just throw in any name or two. Well worth owning despite the numerous slights. It's a hell of lot better than a good number of movies of this circa which have made their way on to blu-ray. Reminds me of the year when Out of Africa bested The Color Purple at the Oscars."
3,"Decent, but not great.","I thought the acting in this movie was great, but the movie just didn't do it for me. It had some good moments, but overall it was slack and boaring. so I think it deserved a well earned 3 stars, but definatly dosen't deserve any more than that."
3,Alright up until the end,"I thought this movie was alright, I would have liked it better if it ended differently. I really believe Taye's character should have ended up with Nia's character because we saw them develop throughout the movie and since their relationship in the past didn't work, I really wanted to see them give another go at it. The reason why I didn't want Taye with Sanaa's character was because we only saw her in the beginning of the movie and in the end, so we didn't really get to see what her character was like to judge rather she would have been better for Taye's character or not. Instead of having the guy with the dreads hook up with the stripper maybe they should have hooked him up with Sanaa's character, I think that would have worked out better so she wouldn't have ended up alone like Nia's character did after all she had been through. Overall, this movie had a great cast and a possible good storyline, I just wish it would have ended differently."
2,"IT'S ONLY ME, BUT:",ANOTHER MOVIE ABOUT A WOULD BE WRITER THAT TRIES TO WRITE ABOOK ABOUT HIS DAYS IN COLLEGE AND TELLING ALL HIS FRIENDS AND ROOM MATES SECREATS. iT CREATES ALL SORTES OF PROBLES AT A WEDDING WHEN THE PAST SECREATS COME OUT IN THE ADVANCE COPY OF THE BOOK. JM
2,Very Average,"aside from Terrence Howard nobody else comes close too match his Grand Performance.the film was way Too Long&Cliched.aside from Nia Long alot of Soul Food Bites here.How For Instance Soul Food Started out with a Earth,Wind&Fire Song this One Ended With one.the writting isn't that strong.The Women Looked Great but their Story-lines were never developed enough.Taye Diggs has Some Talent but hasn't found that Role Yet.MR.Howard Should Have Gotten an Award.cuz without him this film would have been truly Forgettable.nothing new under the sun here."
3,Decent Movie,"This movie isn't one of my favorites but it's not a bad movie. The acting is very good though I'm not too fond of the storyline though. Overall its an okay movie, just don't believe all the hype or you may be a little disappointed."
5,I STILL LOVE THAT MOVIE& ITS THE TRUTH IN ALOT OF SITUATIONS,MEN USUALLY CAN NOT HANDLE THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT HIS LADY DID IN HER PAST BEFORE SHE MET HIM. MEN DO NOT TELL US ABOUT ALL OF HIS PAST SEXUAL DETAILS& WE SHOULD NOT TELL HIM ALL OF OUR PAST SEX DETAILS.
5,Great Company!,"The company that sold me this product sent it on time and undamaged it was shipped properly and it was on time and the cd is great no scratches, I would definitely recommend this company."
5,One of the best I've seen in recent months!,"The moment I saw The Best Man, I knew I had to own the video. The actors in it are excellent and the plot hits close to home. I, too, had a problem with intimacy and commitment, so I can relate to Taye Diggs's character. I laughed out loud and cried (don't tell anyone, okay?) at the end. It is one of the most touching and human stories I have ever seen.In a nutshell, The Best Man is phat!"
4,The Best Movie,"This is one of my favorite movies. As a woman watching all of these fine men in that hustle scene is a bonus. I love the positivity of no gangs, no shooting and no stereotypical thug characters-just a bunch of sexy men with their unique individual appeal to a multitude of women.Story line is a bit predictable but the soundtrack makes up for that. My only complaint is that Always by Stevie Wonder is not on the soundtrack-in the same way that Love & Happiness by Al Green is heard in a lot of movies but never makes the soundtrack."
5,This is a must have for your video/DVD collection!,"What can I say? Morris Chestnut, Taye Diggs, some damn fine men! This was one of those movies that you just can't stop watching. It shows our African American actors and actresses at their bests. I loved it, and have to have it in my home movie collection."
5,A film you won't forget,"I finally rented the film about two weeks ago after a friend begged me to get it. Well, I enjoyed it. I found some parts weak, but on a whole, i liked it. But my rationale is this, why write a book about an experience you would rather kept silent on with the soon to be bride and dedicate the book to the bride and groom? Too much...and too scandalous... His speech at the reception was great. And Terrance Howard's aimless but true character was good."
3,Highly entertaining as far as...,"some of the performances go, but as a whole, the film promises a lot and delivers a little. The plot tangents get way out of hand, and by the end, the whole thing is completely unbelieveable -- not that it was that rooted in reality in the beginning. Worth seeing? On cable. Worth owning? No way."
2,Great to watch -- with the volume on mute!!,"I enjoyed this flick the second time, ONLY because I watched it without ANY sound. That's right, on complete MUTE. This movie just LOOKS good. Whoever wrote this script should be ""slapped"", I mean with a back-hand, too.And Nia?? I like her, she is pretty but girlfriend CANNOT act at all. I don't know if it's her or the script. The audience saw EVERY camera angle of her immaculate haircut, behind her ears, etc. Nia would have been far better in a 30-second hairstyle tv commercial.And that fight scene between Taye and Morris was completely overdone.This will be the last African American film I will see in awhile."
