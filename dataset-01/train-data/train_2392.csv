2,It is not worth the money,"I ordered 3 bottles of this product. And after eat 30 days, I did not see any result worth the money. I don't what is the difference between I drink water and eat this product.And when try to contact customer service, always nobody answer the phone, I left message, there was no one to return my call either"
1,RETURNING!,I ordered a NEW print pack and received a box that is all beat up and it's dated 2001! The die in the ink ribbon is probably all dried up or will dry up quickly once opened!
1,Major Disappointment.,"You can not get better color from your computer printer for pictures then by using Hewlett Packard Glossy Paper. HOWEVERunless you live in 30% Relative Humidity year round it will wrinkle like a lasagna noodle. Bite the bullet and buy the much more expensive Premium PLUS Photo Paper unless you want to keep your pictures under glass or only show them in the winter. Please note, under glass does not mean in a frame, they will wrinkle there also."
3,product not as advertised,"I ordered 4 of HP Premium Photo Paper, Glossy (C6979A, 8.5x11, 50 Sheets) and what I received was 4 of HP Premium Photo Paper, Matte (Q1994A, 8.5x11, 50 Sheets). It was not worth the trouble to try and return or exchange as we were in need of the product when it arrived so we will have to make do I am just disappointed that I did not receive the product that I ordered."
2,Quality and color not as expected,"I don't like to write negative reviews, but I want to let others know about this paper. I have a HP Officejet Pro printer, so I thought that HP paper would be the best way to go. This paper made all of our printed photos look dark and dingy. I had Staples paper prior to purchasing this, and I ended up purchasing Office Depot Premium Photo Paper Gloss after, and both printed much nicer. I would not buy this product again and don't know what to do with all I have left..."
4,Works with Epson Clarisa inks!,"This paper has a gel like coating that gives it its gloss. However, unlike the Premium Plus paper that I also purchased at the same time, this paper works wonderfully with the Epson Printer and their inks. Prints look very close to glossy prints you get from photo labs. Highly recommended."
2,The practice tests are a joke,"This book does not give an accurate idea of what an actual AP test will be like. The Part II questions in the practice tests appear to be made up by the book's authors and not based on actual tests, and the authors underestimated the difficulty considerably. The questions are far easier than anything that would be on the exam.However, this book is usable if you combine it with another reference that contains Part II sections from actual exams."
2,"ok, but needs revision","The review of calculus is hardly efficient. Things like volume and series are inadequate. Although the practice tests are ok, the book needs a bit of work to be really good. The ""examples"" are laughable as well. I'd give this 2.5 stars, since the tests themselves were decent, if not a little misrepresentative."
4,"Forget MC Solar (yawn), get your French rap here.","I met some Swiss guys at the 1998 Montreaux jazz festival who had this CD. French seems to be very suitable to rap, and this upbeat danceable CD seems to hold the interest more than the slow moving MC Solar I've heard. As the Swiss say, 'Das cool, mon'."
5,No need to know french (or spanish),"I've owned this CD for years (bought it at Galeries Lafayette in '94, I think). It's STILL kickin' with unbelieveable grooves and a baseline that other rappers must envy. Even without understanding french and spanish, you'll marvel at the alliteration in the lyrics. If you understand either language, you'll enjoy what the band has to say and the stories they tell. Well worth the Amazon ""import"" price."
4,Remembrance of Things Past,"Reminiscent of the olden days perfume, subtly seductive. Though i prefer more smoky scents over powdery vanilla, this perfume had elegant legs...."
3,MegaBass Functions For CD Player But Not Radio,"At first glance, this CD player excited me because it is very ergonomic, looks super cool, is lightweight, has very stable playback (with G-Protection), and reads regular CD, CD-R, and CD-RW formats. However if like me, you like your music with bass boost for deeper, richer bass tones, you'll be disappointed because the MegaBass works only for the CD player but not for the radio. If this little downside doesn't bother you, then get this product - it's a great CD player with a radio added on..."
4,interesting tale,"a pleasant surprise, not what I was expecting. slow in a few parts but never enough to put down for long. interesting political viewpoints as well. recommended."
2,This 'Flame War' is only lukewarm,"_Flame War_ was unimpressive and dull, though it had a few brief moments of enjoyment buried in it. Cute, stereotyped characters (pudgy, asocial hacker; beautiful female geek; clueless man w/ heart of gold) and poorly planned plot devices (going online without modems/getting diskettes in the mail/being blown up by diskettes with C-4), and maddeningly slow pacing make this book resemble a bowl of porridge rather than the spicy curry of intrigue the jacket promises.Protagonist Harry Garnet, law student-cum-caretaker, provides a style of narration that seems at first silly and flip, then gratingly cutesy. However, the dialogue in general is better than average. Another point in _Flame War_'s favor is its near-accurate depiction of MOOs and MU*s in general.All things considered, though, you'd do well to wait this one out and hope for a more savvy treatment of the 'cyberthriller' premise."
5,"I think her range is fantastic, from blues to funk to jazz!","If you ever have the opportunity to see her live, do it! She is a native to Detroit and we love her there! Her music is emotional and thrilling and in person, she is the same. She adores her fans and performing!"
4,Awesome!,I saw Thornetta at a Jazz show this past weekend and she was AWESOME! I must have some of her music!
5,Brilliant Version of the Tragically Neglected Sinfonietta,"Poulenc's Sinfonietta remains one of my very favorite pieces by my very favorite composer. It is generally regarded as a marginal piece as evidenced by the few recordings. Having heard many if not all of them I can say with absolute certainty that this is the one to buy. It is typical Poulenc: playful, mischievous, fun and dead serious. There are moments that can bring a man to tears with its beauty. It may be a minor work to most of the classical world but they are oh so wrong in neglecting it. I see that this is out of print (although it is avaliable in a boxed set in Europe...well worth acquiring if you care to search it out) but the used prices are very reasonable considering the magnitude of the work and the performance."
5,Great Product,I started taking these tablets as suggested by my doctor for joint pain. Not completely pain free but there is a noticable reduction in the pain. Tablets are big for those that have problems swallowing that size pill. I myself have no problem as they are coated and go down easily. I would definitely recommend this product as price was right and seem to be working.
2,Chilton's Auto Body Repair,Poorly written (spelling and grammar) and outdated information and pictures
5,surprised,I can't believe glass dishes can be sent UPS and not be broken. These dishes are worth it!
3,Not perfect but not bad. Good for everyday dishes.,"Several things should be noted about this item.1. The mugs are heavy stoneware not the thin cups I remember from childhood. (I also remember those cups being insanely hot when filled with coffee.) The change may be a good one but if the description stated the coffee cups were stoneware, I missed it.2. The colors in the picture are washed out. There is significantly more pink than you can tell from the picture and the colors are overall brighter.3. The paint job is just not even on the rim of several plates and I can tell which of my plates were not correctly formed because they don't stack properly.I expect more from Corelle. The quality of this product was one that I would expect to find in a factory outlet."
1,Great product - poor service,"I love shopping at Amazon. They are fast and everything arrives in good shape. But when I purchased this set of Corelle for my mother it was a big disappoitment. It arrived in pieces. You could hear the broken pieces shaking inside the box when the UPS driver handled it to me. I would advise Amazon to work closer with its vendors to make sure they deliver the same good service we, Amazon's customers, are used to."
5,A good guide to avoiding bad hires,"Carol Hacker has done a service to those who are serious about weeding out the costly bad hires that are waiting out there to harm your organization. She makes excellent points and warns about the huge costs of making a mistake.Wayne D. Ford, Ph.D., author of ""How to Spot a Liar in a Job Interview"" and ""How to Spot a Phony Resume"" docwifford@msn.com"
5,A Favorite CD,"The joy of hearing this CD many times has made it one of my all-time favorites. One is treated with Juliane Banse, who in the years since making this recording has become known in Europe as one of the top sopranos, and for many composers the best. Her singing is gorgeous. Moreover the playing of Andras Schiff surpasses the usual accompaniment and opens new insights into these songs. The CD has my top recommendation!"
5,First-class performance,"This is a rather unusual, but altogether happy event. Juliane Banse singing songs of Debussy and Mozart with the great Andras Schiff at the piano. Juliane Banse is one of the most interesting young sopranos of our day. Her voice is pure, big, powerful and expressive. Having won numerous awards and competitions, she has appeared with the greatest conductors and musicians of our time in concert halls all over the world and made several recordings, especially of lieder.Her voice is ideal for this repertoire. Contrary to the previous reviewer, who found her performance bland and unstylish, both her Debussy and her Mozart is lyrical, powerful, expressive and emotional. She seems to be very well attuned to the emotional content of the music and the poetry, and is able to deliver a flawless performance that is thoroughly enjoyable in all respects.I keep returning to this CD only because I find great delight in it. Highly recommended."
5,Find the roots ska-rocksteady-reggae connection,"This is an excellent album for those who want to explore the Upsetters ska/rocksteady, though not much on dub this is the album for the hard core ska fanatics & skins who can seek a connection to reggae & rocksteady. For those dub enthusiast you can feel the roots in this album. If your a roots enthusiast this is a good sample."
2,Scratch: But not this one,"Don't get me wrong, Lee ""Scratch"" is the man, or was the man, and this is a worthwhile collection, but only for those who have most everything else of his early years and are so addicted to Scratch that they're looking to complete their collection. There are a few nice tracks, but these are all available otherwise. Overall, a so-so album."
1,cannot see id caller,"bought this phone to see incomming calls,display was way too dim.needed amazon to help return to seller(minus shipping}note that the phone was new, not remanufactured."
1,no MUTE function,"I use a speakerphone often, and using one without a MUTE capability makes this phone useless to me. I quickly stopped using this phone."
3,"great colors, some hard to wipe clean","These markers are OK, and certainly worth the $$$, but are not quite as good as some of the more expensive markers. The red especially was hard to wipe off. All we had to do was write in fresh ink and then immediately wipe clean."
4,Ok,"these are ok markers, kind of cheap. i guess for a 4year old they are great but some of them are already dried out or out of ink one."
4,"Great markers, but could have found them cheaper","THese are great markers for kids to do dry erase work, but I could have saved money and found them at a local store...like Lakeshore Learning."
5,"Bruce Lee, the Man and the Fighter","This is the best biography I've read about Lee. Bruce Lee's wife captures the intensity of this very gifted man. He was truly incredible. I thought this might be a ""gloss over"" because she is writing about her husband, but she chose to tell the good, the bad, and the ugly. After finishing this very fast read, you will have a much better, balanced picture of an extraordinarly talented martial artist. Lee was a perfectionist bordering on fanaticism. He was born with several gifts that enhanced his performance: superior reflexes, extended reach, etc. He took the best from many different fighting styles and combined them into a martial philosophy that was ahead of it's time. Lee hated the ""style trap"" so many martial artists fall into. ""Use what works, discard the rest."" So said Bruce Lee."
2,From a Woman's Perspective,"I have to take in account the mind-set of women in 70's; but the way Linda Caldwell Lee is telling her version of life with Bruce Lee numerous times over in my opinion is oppressed and subservient, and she seems to embellish that role in his life, and the excuses that was made to spare his ego and state of mind is a hard pill for me to swallow. Given what has been written and reported on, shall I say the ""Dark side"" of Bruce Lee, she endured it by choice and has profited quite handsomely for the pass 37 years"
5,Great DVD's,The best and the hardest DVD yoga instruction I've seen. Comparable to taking an advanced yoga class with an instructor.
1,water connection too fragile,I've been through three of these and all failed at the hose connection to the waterer. The design should include some sort of stress relief bracket or support at the hose connection point.
4,2nd one,I have had one for about 6 years and it has worked fine. I just bought my second one. You need to clean it out once a year and adjust the float periodically.
1,Get the stainless steel one instead,"This waterer is too plastic. The plastic coupling is not good and will fail. Additionally, the chemicals in this plastic will leach into your dog's water, especially if it is in the sun. I thew this one away and got the stainless steel one. It is bigger but actually an ideal size for large and small dogs and although the valve system is plastic, the basin is stainless steel. I also bought the recommeded extra hose coupling (recommended by Amazon in the ""customers who bought this also bought this"" section) which makes the hook-up water tight and easy."
4,nice bowl,"this is our second bowl, the first has worked very well. Had to replace it when it was stepped on and broken off the mount. Going through the bother of locating the same bowl when the local retailer stopped carrying them, and buying a second should say it all."
5,Great product!!,We got this several months ago and we leave it outside - it still works. It survived our Texas summer!
1,"Missing part, disappointing product","Missing the part that hooks to the hose. Cheaply made, very disppointed! Would not recommend. Disappointed beyond words. Toll free customer service on package diesn't work. Wow"
2,Needs Work,"I was excited because this bowl was made of plastic, we had one of the metal ones and it started rusting. Like other reviewers have said the hose connection is awful. After trying 3 different hoses, I've chucked this bowl in the trash."
2,Very short lived product,"After just under 1 year, this thing is completely useless.Two major problems:1)overflow has not worked properly for last 4 months. It uses a simple float mechanism (like a toilet) to stop, which does not properly shut off. We were able to fix it for a few months, but it overflows badly now.2) The other problem is that if you have large dogs with large paws, you will probably want to mount this since 1) it's plastic, thus edible, and 2) they swim in their dishes. The problem is the mount holes are also plastic and the bowl is now tearing away from the weight of the water.Minor problems:1) Fittings are plastic - so it leaks - copious amounts of patience and plumber's tape will do the trick2) No drain hole3) Some of inner fittings have corroded (clearly a local problem)Pros:1) Price2) Color3) It didn't crack or discolor from the sunBottom line: I cannot recommend it."
1,Junk,This was a waste of money. It to a while to get it dialed in (just like Toni's review said above). It worked for a few weeks and then got so scummy. It was impossible to clean properly. The scum was growing from the inside (the part you can't get to) and just seemed unsanitary for the dogs.
4,Autowata bowl,"This is a nice quality product at a reasonable price. That's the good news. The bad news is that my dog, A 70Lb male Boxer, took an immediate dislike to this product. He literally destroyed it in a matter of hours so I can't really comment as to it's long term effectiveness. It is a nice product...too bad my dog didn't think so. He is a rescued dog so perhaps he went to Doggie College as a demolitions expert. :)"
5,Great dog bowl!,Tired of alway filling up your dogs water bowl? This is the best idea I have ever seen! I hard wired it right into my kitchen!
1,78-411 c-clamp,"THIS IS DESCRIBED AS A MODEL 78-411 HEAVY DUTY MODEL, BUT THEY SENT A 78-410 STANDARD DUTY. THE SELLER NEEDS TO EITHER SEND THE RIGHT CLAMP PEOPLE ORDER, OR CHANGE THE AD TO REFECT WHAT THEY ARE SENDING OUT. PERFECTLY GOOD CLAMP, BUT IF I WANTED A 48-410, I WOULD HAVE ORDERED ONE. RATED AT ONE STAR BECAUSE THEY DID NOT SHIP WHAT I ORDERED AND WHAT THEY ADVERTISED. I'LL USE THE CLAMP, TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO EXCHANGE OR RETURN.FOOL ME ONCE, SHAME ON YOU, FOOL ME TWICE.... NOPE, WONT HAPPEN!"
4,Excellent Salsa Album,"This is a great album with hot tracks. All of the song's are good. The singer's, Ismael Ruiz and Axel Martinez, know what they're doing. ""Quiero Volver a Querer"", ""Noche de Mar"", ""Me Encontraras"", ""Amor de Cristal"" are jam's and have that Puerto Rican spice that only the good salsa band's carry. Excellent 80's salsa!"
3,OK.,"This is OK -- it fits, and it's about the same as the OEM filter -- but it's not as nice as the comparable Fram which includes activated charcoal and costs less, too."
2,The one I bought was defective.,"Installed this cartridge on my Denon DP 300F turntable and I was getting music out of one speaker and only buzzing out of the other. I took out the cartridge and double checked all the connections, and everything seemed fine. After fooling around with this for a couple hours I was pretty sure I had a defective cartridge, so I reinstalled the old one and it worked fine. I'll be returning the Grado tomorrow. This might be a great cartridge, who knows, but this one was a dud."
3,Dog lovers beware...,"Harry Crews is a great writer and his story and characters are compelling, but let this review serve as a warning to animal lovers. Amid the book's lost souls and the cruelty and trauma they inflict upon each other, there is also wretched animal abuse. Big Joe breeds and fights pit bulls and what he does to them will break your heart. I embrace the darkest of literature, but I felt manipulated here, subject to some miscreant's attempt to shock for shock's sake. Unlike Faulkner or Cormac McCarthy, the writing here can't quite compensate for the book's atrocities. I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could..."
2,Did I miss something?,I was really looking forward to reading this book in hopes that it would bring back warm memories of the South that I know and love. Not what I got. I think I may have enjoyed this book when I was fifteen and loved all those prepubescent teen books. I was really disappointed.
3,A feast of interest,"The part of this book that will keep you interested are the charactors. The charactors in this book are interesting and down to earth unlike many books. The charactors can be portrayed as southern trailer trash in many ways such as the fact that there is no real honorable charactor in this book. There is a man who owns a liquer store, a man who trains fighting dogs, and a couple of people I portray as crazy in between. When looking for a good novel with a darker theme this is it, if you are looking for one with an amazing ending and you don't really care about the good or bad aspect of the book, this is definantly your book. If you are like me and have an inner drive for the good of man, this book may be painful to read. Overall I found this book very interesting and put together well but it was not for me."
1,Profane junk for the fun of it,"I realize that there are perverted and profane people out there but most authors don't glorify them. Some authors may allow profanity but they don't stuff the pages with it. There may be a vile, sickening villain or several in a novel, but the whole cast isn't made up of them. I read the first pages of this book, then had to toss it aside. Everything bad seemed gratuitous and there was precious little good. Some obviously like Crews stuff, but even some fans had a hard time with this book. Sorry, it ain't my thing."
3,Vcr ate the tape!,Cant really comment.The vcr ate the tape so i never got to watch it. Never happened to n e other movieDont blame the seller tho could be a fluke lol sad i didnt watch it :(
1,Cable length not as stated.,"I choose this rating because I have not been able to use the item yet. The item is supposed to have a 16-1/2 foot cable. The cable goes from the pump to the solar panel. The cable attached to the pump I received is LESS than 10 foot long, so I don't have enough cable length from my bird bath location (that can't be moved) to where the solar panel needs to be located to be in direct sunlight. So, the item doesn't do me much good as it won't run without sunlight on the solar panel and the cable to too short to allow the panel to reach a sunny area. FALSE ADVERTISING! Think twice before purchasing this item if you need a sufficient length of cable as you will be disappointed."
3,Fun addition to your birdbath,"Nice little addition to your typical bird bath. It needs to be directly in the sun for it to work thou which is kind of a hassle. But when it is on, the birds LOVE the moving water. Doesn't store solar, so only works in the daytime in DIRECT sunlight."
3,"Not a bad product, but the sun has to be very bright for it to work","not so great when its not noon or its overcast or cloudy, the solar panel has to be pointing directly at the sun."
1,Not a real fountain!!,"I live in San Diego with lots of sunshine. This product does not work. Waste of time and money. Idea sounds good, but product does not work as promised. In full sun water came our very little and then stopped working!!! I am trying to return the item"
1,Needs battery,"Works great when the sun is directly shining on the solar panel. But if the sun goes behind a tree, everything stops. It needs a battery buffer to store energy so that it doesnt shut off when the sun is temporarily gone. Not useful as is."
1,Not worth the price.,"This solar fountain only works while sunlight is directly on the panel.For the price, it should have the capability to store power for a period of time. I have other items that cost much less than this that store solar."
2,lost in my birdbath,"This item is ""cute"" - for a small birdbath and in a small area. Mine looks ""lost"" in the 18 inch wide bowl in my birdbath and in the wide open surrounding area because the water does not go up too high. It does not go as high as shown in the photo. It would be nice for a smaller bath and maybe on a deck. It is pretty easy to assemble and does work. Just not as impressive as the photo and write up make it appear."
4,"""Yard Boy""","My wife really likes this and so do the birds. We hope that this will draw the hummingbirds this summer! The only draw back is this only runs when the direct sun shines on the panel!!! My little next door neighbor thinks I am magical, I have him walk in front of the panel and it goes off, he asks, ""Mr. G, how'd you do that? We just laugh...... I wish that it stored energy for a few hours when the sun is blocked by a cloud. Other than that, this is a pretty good buy.Yard Boy from Looserville, Kentucky! ""Go Cats"""
1,Smart Solar Meltdown,"1st time ever that I've returned an item to Amazon, but the quality was more than terrible, let alone the product was cheap plastic thru out. Beware of companies that have minor details about their products. The instructions were scarce and very misleading (reminded me of the 60's and Made in Japan). The pump was about 2"" x 3"", (unspecified in the details) now what power, albeit solar, could come of this. The fountain was 1 1/2"" high at most, although Smart Solar specified 2cm-15cm; quite a difference in output. Of course, maybe I received one that the quality control inspector missed on the conveyor as it passed, on its way to consumer land. It doesn't even rate 1 star. This fountain qualifies ""As seen on TV"", buy now and we'll not only charge you $37+, but I'm from the UK, so we'll send you 2 if you act now!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. When I received it the side of the solar panel was cracked! It does not affect the pump. The water just bubbles lightly out of the small plastic attachment on the pump. Not what I expected,I would not recommend this water pump. Very dissappointed! It was not worth the trouble to return it!"
4,The little pump that could...,"This little pump works great when the sun is shining. Where I placed it, this means it runs about 4 hours a day. I have it in a large ceramic basin about 18 inches deep with a few plants and it shoots up about a foot when the sun is steady and goes down from there.I have a lot of trees in my yard and only get sun at certain times so if you have a really sunny spot, this little pump should keep on pumping all day. It makes a nice sound and is very relaxing.The pump is tiny so it is better suited for containers rather than ponds. However, it can also be floated with the black styrofoam disc that is included. I have the nozzle sitting a bit above the water line and used all the included extension tubes and placed it on a rock to achieve that height. Like I said the pump is tiny.Overall I am happy ---just wish I got more sun. This set up doesn't store any energy so my next pump I am going to try one of those for fun."
3,disappointed,"The first one of these fountains I purchased last Spring and it worked great, until our gardner cut the line. I then ordered a 2d one and it only worked about 1 week total, now nothing. I've checked the line, all connections, cleaned the filter and even changed out the solar panel...it still doesn't work. Very disappointed."
4,"water pump works well, though not that attractive if floating","The pump is working well so far. It's easy to use and convenient for a garden or patio. Two things to consider:1. The solar Sunjet does not have solar batteries, therefore it will only work when sunlight shines on the solar panel.2. Customers should consider whether they will submerge or float the pump, because it might be unattractive to have a black disc floating in a fountain. It would be better if the floating circle was green and shaped like a lily pad."
1,"Works well if you like intermittent, brief spurts of water.","I got this product for my birthday. My partner thought it was a whole set up, complete with bowl. What arrived was only the pump. Our first Smart Solar SunJet 150 Solar-powered water pump did not work. We requested a replacement. This next one only worked (sort of - read on) when the solar panel was in full sun (no clouds). There were short 1/2 second bursts of water as the little fountain putt putt putted and spluttered along. It actually made me laugh, the water stream was so brief and intermittent. I wondered why anyone would want such a product? OK, so we did...but why? The company has since informed us that they had a ""bad batch"" and will send us a third replacement. I am not holding my breath."
1,Too wimpy for words,Other reviews said that the fountain action was minimal. I thought that it would be perfect for my small bird bath. The product is worth about $9.99. Very flimsy parts for the pumping action. It does not work well in a typical shallow bird bath. The box contains a plastic net bag that you need to fill with pebbles to hold the pump under water. This will not work in a shallow situation. You can not permanently attach the pump to the surface of the bird bath because the pump requires disassembling for regular cleaning. The solar panel only operates the pump when the sun is DIRECTLY on it. You have to rotate the panel as the sun moves or just plan on enjoying it at that one angle for a short period of time when it is positioned perfectly. Too much money for a rinky-dink product.
2,Don't expect much,I should have payed attention to the other reviews. They were very accurate. It only really works when the sun is a perfect angle so it only lasts but an hour or so unless you manually change the direction of the solar panel. Not worth the money.
4,Great Pump but really noisy,"I've been using solar pumps to water my gardens using a drip system for several years. Every pump I've purchased to date has been quiet, but not this one. It is very noisy and besides the fact that it works very well, the noise is irritating."
2,"Bright, BRIGHT light","This product said it needed direct sunlight, obviously since it is solar powered. But for over $40.00 I feel a little had since it needs seering desert like sun to even pump... A little disapointing... :("
3,Works but...,"I knew it was a solor pump so would need day light to work. But it needs DIRECT, FULL, HOT, SUN! So if you live in the dessert perhaps this would work for you. I thought that technology was further along with solor devices... we have calulators that work under lamp light and path way lights that store energy or charge a battery and work at night. That is what this product needs. Battery pack to store energy and an off and on switch to use when needed. Though it does work I would not recommend it except for limited uses."
2,Disappointing Durability,I purchased a first pump of the same name a couple years ago and another recently. The newest pump started to decline within a couple weeks and stopped altogether within a few months. Old unit ... going strong. I have to agree with an earlier post eluding to a decline in quality.
1,Don't Bother!,"I was so excited about this pump. Took it out of the box, put it together and into the bird bath and it ran for about 3 hours. Then NOTHING. A day later, the pump came on very weakly for a minute or so. The past two days have been clear and sunny yet the pump is NOT working."
1,Under powered,Under direct light on solar panel the pump is barely able to get the water out of the nozzle. Don't expect to see the fountain in the picture.
4,Solar Water Pump,Not a bad product as long as you keep the solar panel under the sun. When it hits a shade then the pump stops. I just wonder how long it would last in the Arizona Desert Heat???
2,Not entirely as represented,"Pictured as coming with a large disc base; none included. Sprayed too high for my bird bath and sprayed the water out of the bowl. I just used the tube to let it bubble like a drinking fountain which was not a bad thing. However, last week the whole unit stopped working for no apparent reason. Worked one day, not the next. I am disappointed, and glad I didn't pay any more for something that didn't even survive two months. Would not recommend this product."
2,"Marginal power, quality OK","This is our 3rd attempt, from various vendors, to get a small solar powered fountain. They usually quit after ~6 months or don't work right out of the box. And forget trying to get service/repairs. All these solar pumps are made in China, and no USA phone numbers.We got 2 of this one, and both worked, but even in bright overhead southern California sun, we get maybe 5 inches of height from the fountains. Hope these last more than one summer."
2,Solar Bird Bath Fountain,"The product is pretty much as advertised. When the sun is shining brightly AND when it isn't blocked by trees in the yard, the pump makes a little fountain that the birds seem to enjoy. Unfortunately, in our yard, given the location of the birdbath (hard to move due to dripper hookup) and within the limits of the length of the power cable, the solar panel is only lighted enough to pump water from about 5 PM to 7 PM CST."
2,Barely 6 inches,I bought this item from Amazon but its been very sad. It barely shoots 6 inches in full sun. I bought it to aerate my pond but it hardly causes even a little ripple on the water. I should return it but I dont want to go through the hassle.
4,two part review,This book is a coffee table book---fine constuction and photos but a bit unwieldly to read . As the title implies this book is an overview not an in depth study-- a good beginning.
3,No Love Battery,"The only thing stopping this from being 4 stars or more for me is the absence of Love Battery, arguably the most underrated band that came out of the Grunge scene (pick up Dayglo if you already haven't)."
3,I can't believe.....,"I bought the !Hype video a few years ago,just to see and hear the first live performance of smells like teen spirit(with the alternate lyrics)...and I found that there is a soundtrack for !hype now,these years later,and I can't believe that version of smells like teen spirit is not on it,I traded nirvana bootlegs for years,This album would have sold many many many more copies if it had that song because you can not find a good quality audio or video of it anywhere in the the bootleg trading circles. The rest of the cd has some good songs,but for me it would have been 10x better with the good audio of slts."
2,"In the words of one Seattle Grunge artist, Overblown","There is one question about the grunge explosion that was never answered. How come the fans of this music (and more pointedly, its journalistic defenders) hated this kind of thing with a passion when Black Sabbath was doing it better?"
4,Cool grunge (and not so grunge) singles,"Like many people (although few would probably admit it), the mainstream hype over ""grunge"" is what got me interested in indie music in the first place. After renting the movie (it's really good), I realized that I had missed out on a lot of great dumb Seattle-area stuff. Not every song on this soundtrack is to my liking, but for the most part they rock, and it has pushed me out there, combing the cd stores for a bunch of new (to me) discs."
4,"Pretty good, but missing a few key songs.","Ok- I'll start by telling you that I love every song on this CD. The main reason that kept it from getting five stars is the exclusion of so many great songs from the motion picture. I mean, the movie went so far out of it's way to showcase some of the best bands ever crammed on to a documentary, and then the soundtrack for the most part followed the mistakes that the major record labels made when signing seattle bands- They didn't go far enough! What about Zipgun, Coffin Break, Hammerbox, and don't even tell me that the bassline & drums from the opening song (Bandages by Crackerbash) didn't make you wanna jump out of your seat and break something. All in all, a good collection, but too many bands on here that everyone has heard of already and not enough of the ones that we haven't."
3,A limited performer,A nice historical document but Calvin displays a very limited palette. Safronia B remains the standout and should be in any serious root collection however the other songs are all similar and do not stand up to repeated listening.For completists only. Calvin does not rank with the great original pioneers of his era.
5,Seattle Strikes Back!,"Finally America has answered the call of British Trip Hop!! And Pigeonhed is the answer. This has got to be one of the MOST original CD's that I ever heard--to come out of this country that is!! Totally expecting this group to be Brits (again), I was shocked to read that they are red blooded Americans. The influces of Black music abound here--and Pigeonhed gives it the greatest of respect--without a doubt, ""Battleflag"" NEEDS to be picked up on the Hip-Hop circuit!! That tune is quite phenomenal. No wonder Lo-Fidelity wanted it on their album!! Blues influence drips from some tunes, and it's done quite well. Like another reviewer said, they NEED to get on the charts to alert the rest of America!! Get this CD and you'll know what I mean!!"
5,Another amazing ride from Shawn and CO....,"With a taste of each album from Shawn Smith, I find myself thanking God I am not deaf. This is an artist who is not afraid to let his magic work shine. Every song is original and grabs it's listener in some way. I am glad to know about him and all of his glorious work, and I pass it on to everyone I know. GET IT, LOVE IT, SHARE IT!"
1,Save your money,"I had high hopes for this book for my genealogy research, thinking it would be lists of names. It's not. It's a list of Towns in each colony with the populations broken down into race, militia, sex and other..without people's names,it's worthless. Unless you want statistics avoid this book and save your money. Wish I had."
2,Disappointing at best,"If you have the VHS versions, I would think twice before buying the DVD. The picture quality is EXACTLY the same- no update for the DVD. Also on the Historia section there are 2 videos for Bringin' On The Heartbreak- the second video is supposed to be the remix version of the song with Phil Collen- he's in the video but they tacked on the original version of the song! This error is NOT on the VHS. Additionally the ""extras"" are 10 min of interviews hacked together with black screen in between them all- I've seen better editing in high school video classes. If you don't have the VHS then this is a good buy. If you do- buy the DVD used and save some money."
3,Disappointed....,"I love Def Leppard, and make no mistake, its GREAT having both of these in a single DVD but I must say that I am a bit disappointed in the release. Only 2.0 STEREO? With a DVD like this there is no excuse whatsoever not to have ATLEAST a 5.1 Dolby mix with a DTS (ES?) being optimal. So after all the delays this has gone through the best they can do is offer a highly inferior sound mix like this? Absolutely ridiculous...Yet I will still buy it simply to have a copy of Historia that I will not have to worry about my VCR eating while I watch it."
5,Love it!,"If you are like me and never got to see them live in the 80's before Steve died, this is a MUST!!! Live footage from the Denver show...this video is just amazing!"
4,the lepp at last,"its about time!, both on one dvd,, two for one, throw away the vhs, this is it, HISTORIA, great SOUND, great videos, nuff said,, IN THE ROUND, IN YOUR FACE,, also great, BUT, still the same sound,, no improvement, but still a great buy, i saw the lepp many times and this is the way to remember a great band in their prime, THE LEPP ROCKS!"
3,The VHS tapes on DVD - and little else...,"If you're a Def Leppard fan I still recommend this DVD. If for no other reason than it being so much easier, on DVD rather than VHS, to skip around both recordings to play your favorite tracks.Unfortunately though, there's little extra. They did include a few videos from Slang, which is nice because, like most fans, I never saw these on MTV. There's also a ten minute or so interview with the band, but its reveals absolutely nothing new. AND the interview takes place in the corner of some office with a shakey camera and almost unbearably bad, echoey, open-mike audio!Also the DVD transfer is mediocre at best. It doesn't look like they bothered striking a fresh print from the film negatives for this DVD release. Its not much better than if you captured & burned your own DVD from your VHS copies!But, as I said, if you're fan its still worth buying now, because I doubt any improved, 'Special Edition' versions will ever come out after these."
3,"Great content, DVD usability questionable","The content on both of the Def Leppard videos is fantastic. My only problem with them is the user-friendliness of the DVDs themselves. The only way to jump from chapter to chapter is by pressing the fast forward button. You cannot access a scene by simply entering the chapter number. Thus, if you are on ""Hello America"" and want to jump to ""Love Bites,"" you got some serious clicking to do.Fans of the VHS copy of Historia might be a little disappointed to see the DVD does not contain the silent movie-like titles between the songs that gave some information on each clip.The reported band commentary tracks did not make the final cut. A few minutes of band interviews is about all the extra features you can expect on these discs, although it is great to see the videos from Slang and Euphoria!!!"
5,"Own the VHS, waiting for the DVD....","All I can say is GET IT!!!! Even if you already own the VHS versions like me, being able to jump from song to song would be great. Reason for it being pushed back ""... it was decided to improve the sound quality to an ""enhanced stereo"" sound, which caused a slight delay..."" came from the Official Def Leppard Site [...]. It would be unreal if they could make it DTS Dolby Digital Surround. Especially since the concert was ""In The Round"". The price Amazon was charging was between [dollar amounts]. Two people can't go to the movies for that anymore, and you get to keep this and play it over and over."
2,Buyer Beware - TOO SHORT,This little video is funny but only lasts 22 minutes - I didn't notice that on the back of the box or I wouldn't have spent my money for one short episode and a second 3 minute review. Not worth the cost and quite a shame they didn't do a real movie or several short episodes. Disappointing.
5,George could learn a thing or two,"George Lucas, take note, you lost your A-game after ""Howard the Duck.""It's a sad time for you when Legos are considered better Star Wars material than the actual source material.This one short flick is better than all three of your prequels that you dithered around with for so many years.You know that sound ""nooooooooo...!!!"" that you keep pushing on the ""fans"" you like to spank?Yeah, that's what we think of your prequels.Time to head out to pasture George and let more real ""talent"" make quality entertainment like this."
2,22 Minutes?,"Much shorter than I expected, only 22 minutes. It isn't a movie, it is a single TV episode. There are ""extras"" that include a couple additional stories, but they don't make up for much. The first one is only about 5 minutes and I think there are five in total (two of which are ""Star Wars in Two Minutes"" (Parts I & II).There is less than an hour of total video time.That said, it is well done, funny, and my son loves it. He watched it 3 times in the first hour he had it. The issue is whether that is because he loved it so much or because it is so short..."
2,My son hated it....it was WAY too short for the money!!,"My 9-year old son bought this with his own money, and he couldn't wait to watch it. When it was over, he and I looked at each other and said, ""Is that it??"" We couldn't believe that it was over after only 22 minutes!!!! He was SO DISAPPOINTED, and he wants his money back. He is a Lego Star Wars fan through and through, but in his words, ""I am very angry."" Don't waste your money on it!"
1,I'm Really Tried of This Stuff.,"This is indeed a straight English hit list of 'B' list artist of the time. Same old junk over and over again. Average sound quality.Again no: Beatles, Rolling Stones, Herman Hermits, Dusty Springfield, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Elton John, Eric Clapton(or any of the great bands he was member of), Rod Stewart, Phil Collins, Queen, The Bee Gees, The Animals, Yes, Genesis, Jethro Tull, Soft Machine, Cat Stevens, Steve Winwood, The Who, David Bowie, Roxy Music, Mott the Hoople, Marc Bolan and T.Rex and many other great bands or solo artists with ZERO input here.What's left for this collection? Very few main stream artists, so we have a ton of artists that didn't even hit the top 100 in the United States during the 60s or 70s.This is to costly for what you get. To few hits included (USA Hits) and average sound. Yuk!"
5,Great series,I like this TV series a lot. It's like catch me if you can but episodic. I like the resolution of this and cant wait to pick up the second season. btw- the supporting cast is pretty good too.
4,Classic light-touch mystery-suspense,"Neither my wife nor I are into dark, grim crime and suspense shows. Not terribly keen, for example, on those CSI shows and coroner shows (though fond of Crossing Jordan, because the characters are so engaging). That's why our faves tend to be things like Monk and Psych and Remington Steele. White Collar's in that tradition of light-touch mystery suspense. The teaming of the master con man with the straightlaced FBI guy makes for a nifty dynamic with lots of potential for friendship and conflict. Just a lot of fun."
4,Love the show!,"I love the show! Only thing with the disc is on Disc 2 episode 7 there's a scratch that gives all my dvd players a hard time. Only Xbox 360 can play it fairly smooth. But when you look at the disc you can't see any visible signs of damage. Otherwise, great show! Very entertaining. Love how they have the backround story of Kate going on on top of each episode's story."
1,Best Series,"White Collar is probably one of the best written series on TV today. The characters perfect, the writing is the best. Doesn't rely on violence, explosions and sex to involve you in a great show. Hope the writers can keep up the excitement with more super writing."
4,White Collar,"My talent is I know what's good. This is entertaining you will like it. Characters work well together. Women will like Matt Bomer, Neil. Everyone will like Willie Garson, Mozzie. The second season is better than the first."
3,I didn't really care for this episode.,"The premise of this episode was interesting--Neal needs to create an impossible forgery, to compete with a rival. The guy he's competing with is one of those mean-spirited people who says things that sting. So, whenever he interacts with Neal, I just ended up feeling bad for Neal.This episode does have some surprises, and it wrapped up in a way that I didn't expect. That was nice."
3,"Honestly, not my favorite episode, but it was OK.","I wasn't on the edge of my seat wondering what would happen, nothing especially clever happened, and it wasn't very funny episode, either.That's okay. Not every episode will be my favorite.You'll probably want to watch this episode so that you don't miss out on something that happens in the ""Kate"" storyline, but otherwise I didn't think it was a very compelling episode."
5,"Entertainment, intrique, with a twist`","From the very first episode, it beomes obvious that White Collar is not your run of the mill cop show. This is creative, entertaining and does have enough excitement for anyone. Top it off that both my wife and daughter enjoy the ""eye candy,"" and I actually get to watch the show without being interrupted with unrelated conversation. There are belly rolling moments with high tension, but ALWAYS a twist to keep your imagination going. In short, this is an awesome program with all the perfect ingredients for a long run."
4,Worth a Try--Entertaining New Series,"If you saw CATCH ME AS YOU CAN starring Leo DiCaprio as the king of the white collar criminals, this series, WHITE COLLAR, is loosely based on that premise. This time, however, everyone is fictional. The two partners are an FBI agent and the con man in the white collar section. This is as much breezy comedy as it is crime drama. This episode has the two of them working on an Iraqi stolen artifacts problem. It is not earth shattering tv but it is good and entertaining. With some work and in time, it might become even better."
4,Good stuff!,"I like this show. Great casting, good stories. What more can you ask for? I'd like to see more of his benefactor and her daughter, both are gorgeous, would like to see their intelligence as well. And what a great place to live! The story about the girlfriend leaving clues is very interesting... can't wait to see that play out. Love the sidekick character as well. Keep 'em coming!"
5,White Collar,I absolutely love White Collar - I am too oheap for cable so when this came out in DVD I grabbed it up and it was worth every penny.
5,Looks great,"USA does a great job between Burn Notice, Psych and now this A+. I hope amazon lets us buy the season."
5,Gift for daughter,My daughter has enjoyed reading all the books in the Mandie series. She reads one and then tells us all about the story in each book.
2,Very Disappointed,"I have always been a huge fan of Mandie books, but I must admit that this is the worst I have read. Mandie has almost no emotions. The author doesn't let us in on what she is thinking. She never has any quiet time to just be Mandie. The story itself has no plot, and the highlight of the book is the last paragraph, which is still lacking. I finished the book in one two hour sitting, and it wasn't from captivation. Mandie's friends are mentioned one or twice, and when she goes home for vacation it is told of in less than one page. The whole book consists of meaningless dialogue. There is no theme, characterization, or setting that Leppard usually does so lovely. I know that I could even write a better book than this."
3,Mrs. Leppard... are you ok?,"I thought the book setting was boring. Unlike all the other Mandie books, this one happened to be SOOOO boring! it skipped around so much and nothing really happened. yes I like the new romance look of things, but everything else was so drole! And it took forever to get published. I hope Leppard gets her game back to the top!BOOK LOVER (and Leppard fan)"
2,"Mandie has to end up with Jonothan, Joe is weird","I have always been unsure if I would continue reading the Mnadie books as she got older and now that shes in college I have to say the books are not as exciting, I am glad she is adding more romance as Mandie gets older, because I have always been interested in two things in theses wonderful books and those two things are the exciting mysteries and how they turn out and Mandie's love life. I have to say I have always pictured Mandie with Jonothan, I think he is a much more interesting person than Joe and also always ready to get involved with a mystery. I hope Sally and Joe end up together, I am not entirely sure YET who Celia should end up with but if Mandie ends up with Joe this series will be dead to me. I'm sorry I went on so much about romance and not as much about the book but all in all I think it is not one of her greater accomplishments but overall still a decent effort on Lois's part. TTFN ( Ta Ta FOR Noiw"
3,Kind of Boring,"This book was ok, but the almost the WHOLE middle of the book was boring! I loved how in the other books Mandie would have special time with her family, but in this book she went there and came back. I don't care who Mandie meets, but if she doesn't marry Joe Woodard I will never read Mandie books again! I mean, he understands her pain of loosing her father, he's always been her friend, and he cares and loves her SO MUCH! Please let Joe marry Mandie!"
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I loved this book! Mandie HAS to marry Joe. I will never read another Mandie book if she marries Jonathan! He is kinda wierd. That is my opinion! Joe really understands her and is there for her. He knows how she feels. I think they are a FANTISTIC pair!
4,We'll never know if Mandy marries Joe,"I just saw on the Mandy website that Lois Leppard died Oct. 5, 2008. So each of us will have to decide who we think Mandy will marry."
3,I was disappointed...,"I'm afraid I was slightly disappointed with this first look at a more grown-up Mandie. The mystery itself was lacking, and I never got the feeling that the mystery was really ""solved"". It seemed like the actual mystery was just blown off.I really missed the heart-to-heart moments we usually see in most Mandie books. We never really get to know how Mandie really feels about her mother being pregnant again and the prospect of a new brother or sister. In earlier books Mandie was very jealous about her new baby brother but eventually overcame that. Did she ever feel that way in this book? Was she scared she might be replaced in her uncle's eyes by his own child? How was she feeling and how did she cope with it? Those questions are never answered as far as I can tell.This book is a disappointing successer to the enjoyable first Mandie series."
5,Best Gundam OVA,"08th MS Team is probably one of the best Gundam OVA and best side story for Mobile Suit Gundam(not talking about Gundam Wing).Unlike Gundam Wing where the Gundams are almost invincible and the pilots are perfect, this has mass production Gundams which are much weaker and have more of a military look and the pilots are just soldiers of the Earth Federation fighting the Zeons. 08th MS Team includes the best that Gundam has to offer. This DVD is the last one in the 08th MS Team OVA and includes the Final episode named ""Last Resort"" which Cartoon Network did not show. So if you want to know what happened to Shiro and Aina you should buy it."
1,Didn't we just come out of the 90s?,"I can't believe this! I remember at the begining of the 90s, people treated the 80s as a LLLOOOOOOOOONNNGGG time ago, I completely different era. I was only 5 when the 90s started, but it still drove me mad in the 90s when people talked about how LLLLLOOONNNGG ago the 80s were. Whenever people in the 90s said things like ""Oh, that happened way back there in the 80s"" I'd just get a confused look on my face! It was just a few years ago people!Now, what does this have to do with this game? Well, people today are doing the exact same thing! They treat the 90s as being way back there, even though we're just a few years removed from the 90s! The news, music, and culture of the 90s are not way back in another time. As far as I'm concerned, they still fall under the category of ""current events"" as opposed to the ""ancient history"" label people are starting to give them.Its 2005 people! The 90s aren't ancient yet!"
4,Great Time - Tough Questions,"The box of The 90's Game reads, ""The 90's are Back."" Although, I didn't think they'd really been gone all that long - I still had a tough time remembering the diner from ""Saved By The Bell"" (The Max, by the way). Regardless, this is much more fun than other trivia games, because even though you remember all the shows, music, movies, etc. from the past decade (as opposed to say stuff from the fities and sixties) - the answers lie in the details - which often are just on the tip of your tongue. The last time I played included a mixed group (some trivia buffs some clueless tag-alongs) and there was enough in there to please both sets. Great time had by all."
5,90's Game Rocks,"After the torrential rains of June, I bought the 90's game this summer as a rainy day activity for my beach house. But we didn't just play the 90's game on rainy afternoons, my housemates were itching to play this game when they woke up, on the beach and before going out at night. The 90's game is a fun game for groups -- never a dull moment, even if you didn't watch every re-run of 90210 and Melrose Place! Everyone can dominate at least some of the categories -- whether you are a music buff, sports fiend, movie aficionado or TV nut -- but it's never too easy to win, nor too difficult to cause boredom."
4,Fun with an unexpected plot twist!,"I have read all of the Justice League series books to my kids (1-6), and we have enjoyed them all. This one is particulary fun as it chronicles the Flash's experiences. The Flash is entertaining because of his witty comments and sense of humor. This book even has a little romance for the Scarlet Speedster and an unexpected twist in its plot. I like how this series is written because it does not dumb down the books. My kids' vocabulary actually increases everytime we sit down to enjoy one of these novels together."
2,Review of a Future Critic,"I personally think that this book was horibble because it was about the Flash and Soviet Super Soldiers. I barely made it to the end. In it the Justice League must convince their counterparts that The U.S. and Russia are friends now. Come to think of it that means there wasn't much fighting in this book.But for collectors, the only good set is a full set."
4,2 Blocks from My Back Door,"Tanya Savory's ""Town to Town"" is an excellent folk set that is one that still reads well 6 years after its initial release. ""40, 80, or 10"" is probably my favorite track with Wanda Vick's fiddle punctuating this uptempo track about a love of travelling & America's highways, ""Now just 2 blocks from my back door I can hear the whisper of 24 & even when I'm sleepin' it comes creepin' like a dream."" The opener, ""When the River Rose,"" is also another lovely little folk gem with Tanya's homey guitar strum and confident vocals, ""5 miles of sand & a floodwall from the 50s, 7 engineers stepping on each other's toes ... it sure didn't count for much when the river rose."" ""Different Shores"" is also a lovely melody with John Mock's tin whistle giving an ethereal setting along with Nancy Given Gardner's beautiful harmony. ""Reuben Brown"" is also an excellent ballad about a farmer grown old. ""Town to Town"" is an excellent folk set, one to seek! Enjoy!"
5,Small masterpiece !!!,"I came across this CD by coincedence in the salebin !?? It was a complete surprise, what a great songwriter and a beautiful voice. The songs are far beyond the average and not as predictable and dull like uncountable albums from songwriterfactories or meaningless artists producing albums who like all the others. This one jumpes out of the mediocre mass of country/folk/bluegrass-cd's. A jewel!!"
3,Not The Worse,"I gave this a three star rating, a good book because it raised a lot of questions. But I also gave it three stars because it raised a lot of questions without going deep enough into them. This is my first book on this subject and I was left wondering about many of subjects that the book touched on but did not elaborate on. Including Nicoli Tesla, who was very involved with the government and experimentation at the time but only gets a few passing paragraphs with nothing in-depth on him.Much of the information in this book is fascinating. Time travel, government funded time machines, ...75 million computers in the 1950's, stolen gold bullion from Nazi germany, teleportation, time dimensions, amazing! The Gray invasion seemed a bit far-fetched (but who knows?). This book did intrigue me enough to start looking for others on these subjects.A good starting place but a little short at 137 pages. Give it a read and decide for yourself."
1,Bielek has been proven a fraud,"Just for those of you out there who don't know, Al Bielek has successfully been proven a fraud by a group of researchers. These are not your typical skeptics, they all still believe that the Phila Experiment happened, but that Bielek was in no way involved with the whole thing.http://www.bielek-debunked.comIt convicned me.People like Commander X and Bielek are taking you for a ride folks, and they're laughing all the way to the bank. I'm not saying there aren't conspiracies, and no, i wasn't sent here by the ""New World Order,"" I'm just trying to tell you people to not believe everything you hear to be fact. This is just science fiction."
2,Some editing and plot problems,"I was disappointed. Twice the main character goes to some other astral plane or whatever when he should have died, for absolutely no reason. The main character is wondering ""why do they want me to get the stone?"" when he hasn't been asked to get the stone, and then some pages later they tell him to go get the stone, so obviously the text had been surgeried with sloppy scars remaining.The author should have set down the final draft for a few days and reread it before turning it in."
4,A World of Words,"A small book about Dr. Johnson and his dictionary that defined an age. It is a wonderful effort for those who love the English language and the words that give it life.Only in his early thirties, Mr. Hitchings is a talented and intelligent writer of the type Dr. Johnson, if he were alive today, would certainly appreciate and invite into his company at the local coffeehouse.Those who enjoy this book should take an oath to obtain and read ""The Life of Samuel Johnson"" by James Boswell."
2,A poorly written book,"The best part of Tabachnick & Fidell's book is its index. It is a splendid sequence of promised statistical techniques that are not plenty fulfilled - at least in a didatical manner. The authors do not wrote a book suited for autodidactic learning. Their book is incomprehensible even to a person who has some introductory notices and a basic knowledge about multivariate statistics and want to continue learning. Their presentation is very, very truncated and faulty. They show lots of tables that they do not explain adequately - specially in the context of each statistical package they explore. Figures misteriously appear and vanish along the explanations. There are several typographical errors. That oeuvre do not look consistent, systematic and organized. It looks like a recorded prolix conversation among statisticians around some loose problems, without the care to make formal the informal flow of ideas . That is a poorly written book. I want my money back."
4,nicely written applied book,This is a very nicely written and popular text on applied multivariate analysis. It does not provide theory but teaches how to use and interpret results from software packages. It has a good set of examples.
5,Appreciation for the Precious Moments in Life,"I am so appreciative to the author for writing a book that actually slowed me down to stop and take stock of the beauty of life around me. It relaxed me, it was relevant to my life and I couldn't put it down. The author is sensitive, knowledgeable and a talented writer. I highly recommend this book for people who want direction on recognizing the important aspects of life. I loved it!"
5,A great collection!,"Seems the choice of songs for inclusion in this collection has some ""Bread heads"" upset, regardless this is a solid collection from one of the best soft rock/pop bands of the 70's! It includes all of their top 40 hits in addition to many cuts from their albums. Sure you can dicker about why it didn't include this song or that and there may be better Bread compilations available, but that doesn't mean this is a bad set! If you are just interested in their hits, then you would probably be more satisfied with ""The Best of Bread"" CD. However, if you want their hits plus samples of songs from their albums, this is a very good collection. ""Retrospective"" may be better (it also costs more), but that is no reason to trash this collection."
2,Rhino bombed out on this one.,"I never thought I'd ever give anything by Bread a low rating. And a 2 is being too easy on this collection. Rhino has a very good rep of giving us collections that has the original recordings and artists. These are the originals. But, I'm sad to say I agree Retrospective is the best collection. So Rhino Recordings if you happen to read our reviews I've got a suggestion. Talk David Gates into releasing the album ""Lost Without Your Love"" on a CD. Or a box set with all of Bread's albums. And/or maybe David's solo albums in another set."
2,Would have thought the anthology was enough,"They brought out the entire bread pantry here...the anthology album was ok, so guess the attempt was to let the world know again whom they were..."
2,"boring, uninspired cash in",Yet another hits collection. How boring. All the same tracks as always. Why not re-release David Gates's solo albums or James Griffin's?
2,Baby I'm-A Want Something Else from Bread,"The other reviews are right. No one needs this repackage of Bread hits. Not when there's RETROSPECTIVE (the 2-CD collection) or THE BEST OF BREAD (a single disc that uses the cover art of the very first Bread collection, and has more songs than that 1973 release).I noticed that these DEFINITIVE COLLECTIONS have the same artwork design. Just another example of the record labels putting their classic artists into a sausage machine.Rhino should give Bread fans what they really want--a CD release of 1977's LOST WITHOUT YOUR LOVE. This was a RIAA-certified Gold record. It's baffling to me that it has never come out on CD."
1,Do Not Buy !,"This is the worst collection if you want Liam's best films. The only films of note are a Mickey Rourke film, a Peter O'Toole film and the super Neeson film Taken. The rest is the stuff they cannot sell individually! It might be worth $3.95. Save your money. If you are a Liam Neeson fan, you already have his good films. I would only recommend buying High Spirits (starring the Great Peter O'Toole) as a fun film for your entire family to enjoy."
2,Don't do the trick,I got these gloves to protect my hands when I use my mandoline.I found if the glove brushes by the blade the knit fabric gets caught and pulls.So these really do not work for the purpose that I bought them for....
2,Cannot recommend for shucking oysters.,"The first problem is that the gloves need something on them - something rubberized - as the oysters slip out of your hands - making the whole process in my opinion more dangerous with the gloves on than without. I felt very unsteady and took them off.Also, they really absorb the smell of what you are working with...Lastly, you have to actually handle the oysters with your hands - and I found myself taking them off and on.Not a good purchase."
3,Thinner than others,These feel pretty thin for index cards. If I wanted them to be this flimsy I would just use scrap paper.
1,Must be a Second,"On lined side, top red title line and some blue body lines have printing voids on all 100 cards. This is a bad batch printing run. I used the blank no-lined side, so it still worked for my project."
3,Strut Mounting kit,I ordered 4 Monroe 902919 and a bolt twisted off on one of them while we were putting them on. The price is right and delivery was good.
3,Good Gift,"I gave this to a friend of mine. Snowy owls are her favorite animal, and she loves it! She says its durable and adorable. The face was a little squashed when I first got it. I tried to mush the face to it's original form, but it still looks a little funny. The picture looks much better than the real thing. The authentic bird sound is a cool feature, but not really necessary."
2,Small & Dirty!,Was trying to find an owl to replicate Hedwig from Harry Potter. This owl arrived looking dirty and it was smaller than described. My 6 year old son thought I was giving him a used stuffed animal and was disappointed.
2,Looks cheap,This owl makes great noises but the eys and nose are nothing like the picture. Very cheap looking like it came from the fair or carnival.
5,It was a gift....,"and he loved it....it's the owl from Harry Potter, according to him!Arrived when expected and looked exactly like described. Thank you."
3,Misleading,"Do not be fooled as I was. In the descriptions it says Snowy Owl 9"". Well the 9"" doesn't mean ""TALL"" like I thought it did. This is only 6"" tall. If you read further down at the bottom is says it is 6"" tall and 9"" wide. I guess that's if you hold the wings out. But this is not 9"" tall. I should have ready down all the way but the product description should be up at the top, not below. The 9"" should be taken out of the title description. Very misleading. I am very disappointed about that. I do like the sounds it makes."
2,Significantly different from picture,The eye colors are totally different from what is pictured. And the eyebrows make it look scared and confused. And the beak doesn't stick out at all. It looks terrified and jaundiced. Pretty disappointed that I didn't listen to the other reviews.
2,Does not look like the picture,Does not look as good as it does in the picture and it is not 9' tall. I don't recommend this to anyone
3,Worth It for One Poem,"There are plenty of poems in this collection that demonstrate themes of Latino/a literature. The most moving and hardest to find is one called ""Concha's Brother."" Beautiful."
2,cheap stuff...,"I would not recommend you buy it. My girlfriend wanted it because it looks nice on her black shelves but it sounds terrible, very metallic, and the whole thing seems a kid toy. The CD loading is slow. One speaker was so bad I thought it was broken. So I called Customer Service: got disconnected. I wrote an email: never got a reply. I am highly disatisfied by this product and the company."
5,Very helpful dictionary,"I must say, I've never seen a Spanish-English dictionary quite as good as this one. It has all of the irregular verb conjugations, and even a section in the middle with translations for many useful phrases. The translations are detailed, and I can't say that there was ever a translation that confused me. This dictionary has been unbelievably helpful, and I would recommend it to anyone trying to learn Spanish."
5,Strauss,"Strauss is not the composer for her? My god, have you heard her rendition of Strauss' Last Four songs? As far as I'm concerned, hers is the only recording of those lieder. Im Abendrot is not to be critically picked apart but to be submitted to as it cascades over your bare soul.Classics is a nice disc too."
4,"A tasty, unique album","This thing is delicious. ""Independent"" is masterful. I think that's his sister singing backups--she adds a lot to the overall feel."
5,blue grass growing tall--good music,"this cd, was good. i got it at a show he played at in yakima. it was splended. very personal. i encourage all who like music with any kind of feeling & emotion to pick this up. if you dont you are really missing out."
5,pants,I received them sooner then schedule which was amazing. The pants fit great and are very comfortable. I would recommend buying a pair.
3,Mayhem vs Titan,"Not a bad baseball pant, but sizes for all Worth pants are not the same. Then Mayhem tends to run a size smaller in the waist than the Titan. The Titan runs a size shorter in length than the Mayhem."
4,Must read,"This book of Gerald Wilde is a must read for anyone involved in traffic safety. It explains why some measures, like ABS systems or airbags, don't work the way you expect. People will drive faster and more dangerous, knowing about these safety measures, is the basic line. You may disagree with some of his views, but it will almost certainly change the way you think about traffic safety...."
5,Wonderful Keepsake,"This book is wonderful because it isn't just a regular journal or scrapbook. It provides a way for you to tell your child all of the things you want them to know and allows them to read your thoughts when they are ready. I like it because it isn't just about the child, but a lot of it is about their parents. I would absolutely recommend this book to any parent. I wish that my parents had given me a copy of this book that they had filled out."
3,NOT CLASSIC DEF LEPPARD,"IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A DVD THAT IS GEARED MORE TOWARD DEF LEPPARD'S CLASSIC SONGS, THIS DVD IS NOT FOR YOU. I PERSONALLY AM NOT A FAN OF VIVIAN CAMPBELL. I AM SURE ALL DEF LEPPARD FANS WISH STEVE WAS STILL WITH US, AND THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF DEF LEPPARD THINGS I LIKE TO SEE. CLASSIC VIDEOS AND CONCERTS. THIS DVD DOES HAVE A FEW A COUPLE VIDEOS WITH STEVE AND THEY TO TALK ABOUT MISSING STEVE HOWEVER IT IS ONLY A SMALL PART AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DVD. I GAVE THIS ONE TO MY SON BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE."
5,Visualize/Video Archieve - Def Leppard,"Awesome. Excellent. Breathtaking! If you love Def Leppard even just a little, this DVD will blow you away. Really amazing. Totally cool."
1,Palestine is NOT a country.,"I am sorry sesame street but you are teaching children incorrect facts. Palestine is NOT a country. Along that route, maybe they should air an episode from the Soviet Union."
3,Sesame with subtitles,"I love Sesame Street. I love that it has always shown diversity and this particular series shows an appreciation for other cultures. The songs and dances are fantastic. As an adult, I enjoy watching it with my daughter. Where this series lost me is that so much of it is done in foreign languages, with subtitles. That might be fine for the elementary school audience, but most children who watch Sesame Street cannot yet read - and if they can read, they can't do it quickly enough to keep up with the subtitles. Beyond that, I think this series is great. I just wish the creators would have considered the literacy level of their audience a little more."
5,love this!!!!!!!!!!,Love this so much and I really feel that everyone that sees it will also love it. Its educational fun and teaches at the same time I just wish there were more episodes.
5,Still excellent teaching tools,I had several Sesame Street products when I was little and they really helped in the learning process. I work with young children now and I hope they help as much for them.
1,Deceiving seller,"This dvd is a Region 2, NOT playable in the USA. That info was not shown at the top of the listing as many other european sellers do. I now know that it was mentioned towards the BOTTOM of the listing. I did not need to read all of that info, as I already knew about the movie. Thus I placed my order just from the title and the price. I now have a DVD which I cannot use, and I have no intention of PAYING to send it back. Very deceitful and untrustworthy English seller in my opinion. I have purchased many VHS tapes and other dvds over the years from european sellers, and they ALL showed what the Region was at the TOP of the listing just under the price. I caution others to be very careful when dealing with this particular merchant, or they will otherwise regret it."
2,"Music is wonderful, but....","If you love listening to Carmen Cavellero play the piano in lieu of Mr. Duchin, you will enjoy this movie."
4,The Eddy Duchin Story,Recommended by a good friend. An excelent movie with great acting from both the leads and the young boy who plays his Son. I was also very impressed by the speed at which the movie came. One week half way around the world to Australia is pretty impressive. Thank you.
5,Fabulous Music,"I've watched this video over and over. The music in ""The Eddy Duchin Story"" comprises many of my all time favorites and includes a version of Chop-Sticks that you want to rewind and watch again. The story isn't bad either, it can drive you to tears. A great buy.Beverly J Scott author of Righteous Revenge"
5,Homeschool Co-op Class,We are using the 300 and 500 to teach our electrical class to upper elementary students.We are using the student and teacher guides to cover concepts. We will have a kit fortwo students to work independently with guidance. Our class starts in January.Jim
4,Snap circuits PRO SC 500,"We have 100 and expert(?) level of same product.Son has requested to have another motor and other main supplies.He has generated many ideas and enjoy playing with it.My suggestion is that they could sell main product i.e. motor, solar pannel, etc. seperately.thanks"
5,Kids loved it!,Kept them busy experimenting for hours. They were cute little engineers and scientists working n the floor making all kinds of crazy things.
5,Great Learning Experience,"This educational game will broaden the learning experience of an inquisive child. My 6 yr old grandson ""Loves"" this toy. His Dad initially sat with him on the first several experiments, but then he quickly learned circuit concepts and did the the next 15 projects on his own...He spends hours with this gift. Many of his friends and their parents who have seen him playing with this are now planning on also purchasing this for their kids for upcoming birthdays. This new awareness lets him understand how electricity works..and has led to interesting discussions about how things work in the home...Flipping on a light switch...what does this mean? etc. ...I recommend also buying the battery eliminator."
5,Snap Circuits SC500,I bought the SC500 as a Christmas gift for my son. It is relative easy and simple to build and keeps him busy for hours. Much simpler that the kits we used to get many years ago. He is now saving for the SC750 upgrade and the Rover kit.
4,Educational Electronic Circuit Builder,"Well made and educational. Easy to follow ""pictoral"" build pages. Many, many circuits to build. I purchased the set to teach my grandkids about electronic circuits. The pictorals are great, but would be even better if it had schematic diagrams too.Note: The recorder / playback amplifier circuit should have a much lower value coupling capacitor. The value called for causes much distortion. Use a 120pf instead."
4,Donald's choice,Snap Circuits PRO SC-500Bought it for our Grandson who is 11 yr. old. He had the SC-100 and wanted a bigger one. Was very happy. He likes building and creating things.
4,Snap Circuits are fun!,"I wasn't sure if this product would be good for my son's 11th birthday, but decided to go for it. He couldn't stop playing with it. This 500 project set had three books of ""projects"" for him to put together. Each project has easy to follow directions with a description of why it works. The science teacher at our middle school is requesting the PTA to purchase several of the smaller snap circuits sets for her science lab, so it must be good education."
1,Warning: birth defects and other reproductive harm,"From the Amazon review this looks like a great toy, so I went to a local store to confirm that it would be suitable for our son. The box contains the following warning: ""WARNING: This product contains chemicals, including lead, known to the State of California to cause birth defects and other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling."""
1,I gave it as a gift,"I gave it as a gift to my nephew as a 7 year birthday gift, he loves it.I never saw it so I can't review it."
5,Gift for Grandson and his Dad,This was a great gift for my Grandson and Son-in-law. They started putting making things right away. They built a radio Christmas day. I am sure they will get lots of use from this gift.
5,A must for your little scientist,"This is a wonderful toy and teaching tool combined. If you have expertise in circuits then you're set. If not, then you need to order the Student Guide for Electronic Snap Circuits from Timberdoodle.com. I couldn't find it on Amazon so I went searching on the homeschool websites.My 7 year old son loves this set and Dad enjoys helping him learn all about electronics."
3,Not as it seems,"Despite the pic, it is only 1 (one) cylinder and pin. Still not a horrible price, but not the great deal that it seems."
3,What 18v said it would be,"Sure, this album compares nothing to ""Vanity"" which is mine and most others favorite 18v album. But hey, if you follow the band they've been saying how much different this one was going to sound. Yes i agree it's a little trendy and alot of bands are changing their styles on there newer music. Take a look at AFI,UnderOath,Thrice and alot of other good bands. Lets face it bands evolve for whatever reasons. Some change for what they believe and some do it for other reasons. Give it a chance."
3,Metacore/Screamo,"Well produced album but not really something I'm a huge fan of. Lots of whining about lost girlfreinds, broken hearts, woa is me kinda metal. For fans of AFI, MY CHEMICAL ROMANCE, BULLET FOR MY VALENTINE, and AVENGED SEVENFOLD."
2,More pop? No thanks...,"Obsession from Eighteen Visions was probably one of my top CD's I owned, so I decided to give this CD a shot obviously - I was counting the days until its release.After doing a run through on the CD, I was very disappointed. They seem to have regressed in evolutionary sound, Obsession was much more raw, harder and interesting to listen to compared to this. You can tell that they had major record label influence to turn out songs they could play on the radio.I can honestly say I only like two songs on the entire CD, I hate their single Victim - it's not even that good of a song to begin with!The only songs I can say are worth listening to are Black And Bruised, and The Sweetest Memory. Although even the best of the best on this CD are still sub par compared to anything on Obsession.It saddens me when bands lose their sound, because that's what happened with Eighteen Visions."
5,really really good uk fan,"Ok now we have an album which is much much different than the old 18v thats all im going to say on this stupid OMG UVE SOLD OUT CUS U DONT SOUND THE SAME AS U USED TO.i think his voice sounds amazing on this record the vocal lessons paid off for sure, the music is more advanced i agree some elements have come from the last record obsession but thats a dam good thing becasue that album was fantastic. this new album is basically giving all the fans who like old stuff who dont agree with the new stuff the middle finger, james is NOT trying to copy anyones voice hes not ripping off any bands sound or trying to be anyoneall the band are doing is making a sound THEY like and making music becasue thats where they are at nowso all u whiney idiots who are reviewing this album saying its pants JUST becasue no screaming is in it and it dont sound the same as vantiy just dont listen to it"
1,just another memory...,"If you like straight up hard rock then this cd is for you, but man, I hate it when bands that I used to really like put out cheezy albums just to sell more records. Yeah, they say they evolved with time, but please, they don't even do it well. There are no true hardcore influences here at all. Ok, there may be heavy parts to this cd, but nothing compared to ""Until the Ink Runs Out"", ""Best Of"", ""Vanity"", and even ""Obsession"" had heavier parts and more emotion (""Tower Of Snakes""). As far as I'm concerned, Vanity was their last good album, even though I did kind of like ""Obsession"". Rest in peace Visions. What once was will never be again."
3,Who will they be next?,"On Vanity, they sounded like every other metalcore band. On OBsessions, they were Velvet Revolver meets the Deftones meets Incubus. This time around on their self-titled album, they are pretty much Marilyn Manson meets Def Leppard. You heard it folks... DEF LEPPARD! Listen to Broken Hearted and all you'll be thinking is Def Leppard failing to recapture their htis on Hysteria. There are some Marilyn Manson-esque beats. Don't forget Poison covering Drowning Pool on Victim!It's not the worst album around but it lacks originality."
2,Searching for the best towels? This isn't it.,"I bought this towel in April. After regular washings, it has two holes in it. It is absorbent, which is very important to me. But soon there won't be any towel left to absorb anything! It's really too bad. I would have loved to give it five stars. Oh well the best towel search goes on."
3,See it for the Score,"I was checking this movie out because I was interested in buying the DVD. How disappointing to see it's not available.The movie itself is extremely interesting, but I wanted it just for the soundtrack. This is one of John Barry's best scores. I guess I'll just have to go listen to Moviola again..."
3,"""Still They're Cousins...""","This is the story of Mary, Queen of Scots and her cousin, Queen Elizabeth (daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn). Mary was eventually executed by Elizabeth.To get a better grasp of the history, I'd been extremely eager to see this film. It wound up taking several evenings. In spite of my best efforts to stay awake, the film put me to sleep four times!With regard to historical liberties, Wikepedia only mentions two fictional meetings between Mary & Elizabeth and Mary's taste for hot chocolate. I find it doubtful that this list is complete.Perhaps, my expectations were too high, & I should have been looking for written works all along."
5,Mostly good performances here,"The two leading ladies are the best parts of this film, which chronicles the unhappy life of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her conflicts with her cousin, Elizabeth I. Glenda Jackson as the latter is especially dynamic, forceful and interesting to watch. The costumes and locations are nicely done, and the music is suitable enough.Some of the male performers do not fare as well, and better actors could have been chosen. I actually laughed when Vizzio was being killed because he screamed like a little girl.If you are interested in the lives of these people, this one is worth checking out."
2,A fiction,This movie is so historicaly inaccurate that it will blow the mind of a tudor history fan. When they showed Mary and Elizabeth meething in private in the middle of the forrest I had to turn the film off. If Mary and Elizabeth had met face to face it could have greatly changed the course of history.If you are a fan of history you will be disapointed in the inaccuracies and if you could care less about history then this movie will bore you to tears.
4,Oldie but Goodie,"In todays world of movies, everything is special effects. This movie gives you a great display of acting and story line without all the computer generated effects. If you are looking for a great story line and good acting, look no further."
4,Jan,Very good movie but I wish it was available in all regions in DVD! I live in Australia and can't find it in Region 4 DVD.
5,DVD! DVD!! DVD!!!,"Made during a time when ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" was a critical and, I assume, financial, success, and ""Elizabeth R"" was popular on PBS, this film kind of got lost. But as I remember it, it was wonderful--a real human interest story as well as fascinating history--done in a naturalistic style. Vanessa Redgrave was tour de force--simply electrifying, and I'm sure sure she was nominated for an Oscar. I was so impressed, I went back to the theatre at least once and very possibly twice to see it again. I have to wonder how my reaction then would hold up today, after so many years of life lived in between.But, the point is: this film should be on DVD!!"
3,Not as good as the movie,"This book has quite a bit of charm especially in the first half when the relationship between the Colonel and Lydia is established. As it moves on, it seems to bog down in too much of the day to day of the tribe of gypsies as they travel together. I thought there was way too much about gypsy women being all over any man they were around. But, the story of the relationship between the Colonel and Lydia remained tender. Of course I liked the ending of the movie much better than that of the book."
5,Great read!,What a cute story! Great read for a child who loves dinosaurs! Would highly recommend this book. My 4 y/o grandson loved it.
3,"Story nice, surprised at the wording in the book given the age","Story is cute, but why did the author feel that he needed to use the word ""stupid""? We will be returning the book."
5,Wonderful...Love Carlton Pearson,Great Praise and worship...Have not listen to this one all the way thru but if it follows suit to all of Carlton Pearson I know I will love it.
5,Precious memories,"I had this album on tape several years ago, but apparently I wore the tape out. I was very happy to see it on cd. Listening has brought back so many precious memories. Thank you so much. I rate this cd the highest level possible not only because I love Carlton Pearson, but also because Azusa meant so much to the body of believers in Christ."
2,Definitely not as good...,"I bought this strictly out of the love of their other CD on the Sub Pop label - Massachusetts. That CD was absolutely amazing. A strange twist of soft country feel, wrapped around dark lyrics, with none of the country TWANG. This CD, however, is none of that. This is almost all country and splattered with TWANG - pure and simple. And not what I'd really call ""good country."" (If there is such a thing.) But the one thing that this CD does show is that Massachusetts showed how much they had grown from this recording. Too bad they broke up."
3,SMB should come back!,"Pretty good album, some songs are fantastic and creative. I ripped it on my IPod and left only a couple of tunes off and fully enjoy it. ""Massachusetts"", however, is where you want to start if you are interested in the SMB"
2,Works but why we have to use this?,"This adapter allows you to use earphones on the Gameboy Advance SP system. It works, but it's unethical of Nintendo to force us to fork out more money and it adds bulk to the SP."
3,Works fine - Annoying to require special earphones,"I bought the earphone adapter so that my son can play our Game Boy on a flight without annoying everyone or having to battle with him to keep the volume down. I tried it out with Mario World and it works fine and sounds as good as synthesized, cheesy, videogame music could sound. I agree that it is annoying to have to spend the extra money for special earphones, though all the game consoles try to nickel and dime you. Same deal with the Game Cube: Oh, you wanted *two* controllers with that? Oh, you wanted to be able to save your game?"
1,I steal a lot of songs,"Father: you got the chord there budSon: I think soFather: My father showed me this one back in the days goes something like this, ready sonSon: I think soFather: you can go firstSon: no, you go ahead daddy, I like to copyFather: Hey there son, we are going to looseI said son, you are going to looseYou are going to loose, all your houses you cars and your womanSon: That's OK cuz all I gotto do I just ask some body to write for meFather: I steal a lot of songs; I said I steal a lot of songs from other writers in the worldI even tried to get your girl but I got no gainSon: I gotto ask Cruz"
4,"A Good, Short Biography","Steve Watkins was not always pastor of Kenton Baptist Church as he is today. In 1987, after deciding he was not eager to face four years of college, he decided to join the Navy with a view to being one of the elite Navy Seals. Not lacking in ability or motivation, he did just that and began a successful career in the military. He served in Iraq during the Gulf War but eventually left the Navy to pursue the pastorate. He graduated from the Masters Seminary in Los Angeles and, since then, has been serving Kenton Baptist Church in Kenton, Kentucky. This biography recounts his career in the armed forces and his eventual conversion. It is an enjoyable read, especially for those with an interest in military affairs. Watkins offers an interesting description of his conversion and is careful to ascribe all glory to God."
1,Go buy a different book!,"Our school ordered tens of copies of this book for our AP Chem class, and it wasn't helpful at all! First, the tests weren't like the AP Exam. Second, the book covered topics not in any of the AP guidelines, e.g. calculus-based chemistry/physics. Please, why waste your precious money and time with this book? I'm told that this is not uncommon for books from this publisher, so I'd avoid them."
3,Bit stiff,"Once built, the gear friction tends to bind up and only ran across the floor with fresh batteries. Great rainy day project with my 8 year old. Required serious supervision with this age bracket as even I had to study the assembly diagram intensely before being able to coach my young one to build it. Overall very rewarding to get this thing to run."
4,It's paper,"It's paper cut 4x6. It's decent card stock, bright white. Can scribble all sorts of notes on them. It's an index card."
2,I don't believe these to be 925 silver,disappointed that these rings (bought two) turn black while ON the hand. My tiffany's silver bracelet NEVER tarnishes while wearing it..
4,Good stuff - why are Garbage more famous?,"Not been into Curve for that long. Cannot understand why this lot have been overlooked in place of Garbage. Curve = kick arse songs (esp. ""Something familiar"") and Toni Halliday is far better looking and a better singer. If she wants a dirty high she can come and get it."
5,Loud. jarring. sexy. abrasive.,"CURVE's new CD has some much energy it will knock you over....they have revamped thier sound into something I have never heard before....its noisy, erotic, confusing, and full of self-loathing lyrics...like Nine Inch Nails or Garbage, but with a hell of a lot more intensity.."
4,"Wow, welcome back!","Back and louder than ever before. I bought Chinese Burn and thought it was ok, but the album is fantastic! Her voice with that wall of noise is just classic. You watch, in 10 years there will be a band that sounds just like them selling millions of records. Brilliant band."
3,There's a great Curve ep buried in here somewhere...,"The lead-off track, 'Chinese Burn', is easily the greatest Curve song ever. And that's saying alot, considering how many great Curve songs there's been. COME CLEAN is worth buying just for that one track. Unfortunately, many of the other songs on this cd suffer from either bad songwriting ('Cotton Candy', 'Alligators Getting Up', 'Beyond Reach') or annoyingly abrasive production ('Dog Bone', 'Sweetback', 'Come Clean').There are some other outstanding tracks on here besides 'Chinese Burn'. 'Something Familiar', 'Dirty High' and 'Forgotten Sanity' are wonderful. So is 'Recovery', although the version on COME CLEAN isn't quite as breathtaking as the original 1996 PINK GIRL WITH THE BLUES ep version."
2,A dull drone of an album...,"I have both ""Doppleganger"" and ""Cuckoo""; They are both thoughtful driving albums. However, this latest effort from Curve seems a bit too cloying, laced with obvious club beats, dull lyrics, and unispired delivery that will put you to sleep. Its understandable that ""Chinese Burn"" is this album's single; It is the track that marginally saves this album from getting one star..."
2,Horrible!,"This a terrible recording in every way. First of all, what a bad, dry sound! I wonder how Gardiner did accept it. If you only listen this ""experience"" you think that Berlioz's original sound and text was disaster. But you have an another chance! Listen to Minkowski(DG) and see what is the ""period interpretion"" of this symphony."
5,"Thanks a lot, Amazon....","This is a review, NOT of the CD (which I know to be superb), but of Amazon's inadequacy in getting the recording to me.When I ordered this CD, I made it a rush order, b/c I wanted to use it for study: I had a conducting final exam coming up in which I was to rehearse and conduct the first third of the Gloria. It never came, and I was informed of its non-availability (which was never posted on the tracking info) about 10 days later - about three days before the exam was to take place. I was able to purchase it, download it, and listen online, which is what I should have done in the first place, probably; but I certainly hope that Amazon's inefficiency isn't typical of the service one should expect from them. Very disappointing."
1,Only for Right Wing Republicans,"I bought some Trump the Fragrance and tried it out recently. When my wife got a whiff of me she immediately sent me outside to the deck. (Thank goodness the Wi-Fi works out here) She said I wasn't allowed in the house until November, 2012 unless she could hose that smell off of me.I'm holding out until the Iowa caucuses!Can't please those Democrats."
2,"Anything but ""easy"" to use","The marketing hype says ""easy and simple"", I'm finding that Bluetooth is anything but. Had to download beta-test software from the manufacturer to make this card work with my PDA, and am now to consider myself an ""early adopter"". What happened to ""simple and easy""-- and the card is selling for top dollar."
1,DON'T BUY THIS TV,"I purchased this TV for $2400+tax in November 2005. In April 2007 it ceased to function. Fortunately I had the Best Buy (should be called Worst Buy) 4 year performance service plan (for which I paid an additional $400). It took a few days for the independent contractor that services the warranty to pick up the set, then it took 2 weeks for me to get it back. When I got it back it turned on just fine the first time. The second time I tried to turn it on it no longer worked. It's back in the contractor's shop now for who knows how long. Best Buy won't replace the TV until the FOURTH time it fails to work....I will update this review..."
4,Frustrated,"I love Pappano's books, and this one had the potential to be terrific. However, I got extremely frustrated at Neely's easy capitulation and forgiveness of Reese's totally unforgivable, unconscionable and devastating actions and cruelty. Even though he was wrong, and knowing he still hates her after nine years. After his betrayal and treatment, what's left to love about him? Yes, she did defend herself and stand up to him a bit, but to still be in love with him? Of course, if she had finally hated him, there would have been no story."
1,ViewSonic has the worst customer service ever!,Do not order this product unless you have the patience of a saint! I have been waiting nearly a year for the bolts that hold the monitor to the base that they forgot to return to me when I had it serviced under warranty.
2,Power cord gave us serious problems,"We ordered this as a refurbished monitor from tech_for_less. The monitor itself was quite nice, although the resolution seems low compared to the monitor we are using now. The biggest problem we had, which was actually quite serious, was that the power cord that plugs into the back of the monitor didn't stay in place. We couldn't move this monitor more than an inch or two without the plug separating from the back of the monitor. It didn't seem like it fit very well into the monitor socket (not sure what to call that). We sold it and truthfully, I'm glad to be rid of it. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,"bad pixels, small","Bought this as a gold box deal. Paid 130, and even then this was definitely not worth it!! There are 3 dead pixels........right out of the box. Also, it is tall....but since they measure screen size corner to corner......well........it looks like it is a 15"" crt size. Would not recommend."
4,ViewSonic Optiquest Q7b Monitor,"Excellent value, only drawback is the stand. It is very low, and to view the monitor anywhere near eye level you have to build up the base."
3,Great for the price,"I purchased this monitor to replace my CRT which was showing it's age. Didn't want to fork over a major investment so this was what I ended up with after doing a minimal amount of product research.Overall I am very pleased with it although it goes to show you, once again, that you get what you pay for. The picture and response rate is first class. No complaints there. But I was surprised to the the point of disappointment in the poor sound quality. I'm not an audiophile by any stretch of the imagination but these speakers sounded like I was listening to an old transistor radio. So much so that I fished out my old PC speakers which I was expecting to throw out and hooking them back up again.That aside the picture is a huge improvement over my CRT and is at least as good as the monitor I use daily at work."
3,Decent Monitor,"I've owned Viewsonics in the past and have always been pleased with them. With this one, I knew it was one of their cheaper models but felt that since it was a Viewsonic I'd still get a great product. It's a decent monitor, but the color display could be better. It's overly contrast-y. Colors are way to o bright. I've adjusted and re-adjusted the color but with little improvement. Also, it does not have an adjustable or swivel neck, so how it comes out of the box is how it stays.Overall, it's a decent, cheap monitor."
2,There are a lot better trios available than these.,"If I wrote a piano trio, my first choice would be to have it interpreted by the Beaux Arts Trio. Their skill and finesse is beyond compare. Their considerable talents, nonetheless, fail to elevate these trios to the same exalted level of the finest of Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert, Hummel, etc. I found listening to these two trios more of a chore than a pleasure. While the proficiency of Korngold and Zemlinsky is without question, I find their lack of exceptional melodic moments reduced my listening experience to one of desiring these compositions to be over and done with as soon as possible. Perhaps others with more sophisticated tastes than mine might find some redeeming moments in these pieces; but these recordings did not work for me at all."
5,Great gift!,Gave as a gift from East Coast to the West Coast! THey loved it! In fact the dog did too!
1,I feel cheated,"The tennis balls themselves are fine, but the listing is misleading. I expected 3 cans of 3 balls (9balls). I received one can of 3. You should buy tennis balls elsewhere."
5,Book,This is a technical book but for someone wanting in depth knowledge of MSM it is great. I learned a lot from it.
4,"Great ""special"" Pen","This pen has a beautiful color combo and is comfortable and balanced. This was a gift for a family member who had chosen the same one to give someone else. He was very pleased with it, although the refill that came with it was dry and a new one had to be purchased. Would have been nice to receive a working refill, especially since it was a gift."
5,"Great poems, black & white historical photoes, I love it!","I bring to life the human character in Dunbars poetry and prose as 'Lias' Mother and when I perform or present workshops on Dunbar to schools, libraries, churches, Civil War Roundtables and many other public and private organizations I recommend this book everytime!"
3,good,It is ok for what it is . If you want true stories of k-9 polcie this is the book for you. I recomend a movie called k-9 cop witch is the tranning of these amazing dogs .
5,perfect present for a three year old girl,"We bought this for our three year old girl as a birthday present. She loves it ! She can fit two of her favourite dolls into it. It is sturdy, easily folds up for trips in the car and is a perfect height for her. I am sure it will last for a long time and her younger sister will even get some use out of it."
2,Not their best recording,"It sounds like it thrown together in a day, there was no cohesiveness in group and there are many little mistakes on the CD. It was definetly not their best CD. Their others are great and I recommend all of them except this one."
5,Great Gift!!,I ordered this book and had an ideia how it could be....and when I received it I was impressed!!! For such price you can never buy such a great book!!! It's big and has very good photos.It's the best gift you can offer to someone!Highly recomend!!!
5,Really smoothe!,I love this CD. Really good grooves. Every track has it's own style and I look forward to more from this label. (much more!) Thank you Sweet Mother!
1,A terrible attempt at recapturing glory.,"This is, unfortunately, a terrible album. First things straight, this is NOT the classic lineup that people know as ""The Mamas and The Papas."" It is not even the lineup pictured on the cover. Instead, it is a live recording of the latest incarnation of the group, with only original leader Papa John Phillips remaining.In the 1980's Phillips re-grouped a new version of the band (sans his ex-wife Michelle and the late Cass Elliot.) The group has since undergone many different members. What we have here is a poor recording with woefully bad singers done in the late 90's. It really is painful to hear these classic songs butchered. This should be purchased only by serious Mamas and Papas collectors, all others should do themselves a favor and buy the wonderful anthology set ""Creeque Alley: The History of the Mamas and The Papas."" If I had the option, I would give this disc a no star rating."
1,The worst cd I have ever listened to!!!!!,"This is the absolute worst cd ever! When I put on the 1st song i knew something wasn't right. It doesn't even sound like the Mama's and the Papas,and sure enough it's not them, just papa John. Not only are the voices horrible, singing off key, but it sounds like someone recorded this in their garage. I couldn't even listen to the whole cd all the way to the end. It went straight in the trash. Please take my advice and don't waste your money!"
3,Confused,"The notes say that ""Night in Tunisia"" was recorded in 1961.Why is it the same break and solo as the 1949 Blue Note recording?"
5,These guys are destined for greatness! -Mary in Seattle,"So refreshing! Fictura is going to make an impact on the scene. If you are ever in New York, go see them live...I highly recomend it! And... they are a dreamy bunch of guys, too! Get this cd any way you can...you won't be disapointed!"
3,"Ok, but no Maby","I'm a big fan of Joe Jackson and his band, especially (but not limited to) their energetic first two albums. But the Joe Jackson band without Graham Maby on bass is like The Who without Keith Moon on drums. Maby has been with Joe from the start, right up to the present (current) tour. But this particular DVD was shot during a very rare time when Maby wasn't part of the JJ tour. With all those other shows available for release, why this one? The replacement bassist isn't bad, I'd say he's above average for a typical rock bass player. But JJ's music requires a special type of bass player, and Graham Maby is the real deal. So I'd only recommend this DVD for people who must have everything Joe Jackson, but in my opinion you are not hearing a ""true"" JJ show unless you get Graham Maby in the mix."
3,abstraction of the abstract,"any joy division fan will enjoy this disc; not for the raw, disturbing lyrics flowing from ian, but for the outstanding musical rendering of emotion an outstanding charicature of joy division's music"
3,"Eternal, Yez","When Lionel Ritchie released an album called ""Can't Slow Down"" he knew what he was doing- -any slower and he would have stopped moving altogether. So what to make of an hour-long, single-track, lugubrious orchestral album called ""The Eternal"" in which the late, great Joy Division is stripped of most lyrics and dynamics (not to mention pacing)? Well, at least The Nau Ensemble has appropriated JD as its own- -most of this is pretty opaque even when an honest-to-gosh melody uh, kicks in. Which is okay I suppose, though the effect comes off, presumably unintentionally given the artwork, more as satire than tribute. Stifle those goth giggles. With music this dolorous, who needs lyrics anyhoo?"
4,Limpide et grave,"Histoire d'un adolescent dans les années 50 qui vit de la mer, de la pche et du soleil sur une le au Sud de L'Italie. Une le où la guerre est finie mais qui a laissé ses empreintes: les américains sont encore présents et les touristes allemands profitent des beautés de l'Ile et de son soleil. Pour cet adolescent, il faut se rappeler, comprendre ce qu'à été cette guerre et le rle joué par chacun malgré le silence entretenu. Sa conscience le conduira à fouiller ce passé. La complicité et l'amour qu'il aura pour Caia, une jeune femme juive dont la famille a été déportée, le pousseront à vouloir venger ce passé.Un livre merveilleux, où les images parlent au-delà d'elles-mmes et où les mots s'engagent dans la qute d'une vérité d'un passé qu'il faut corriger.L'écriture est belle, limpide mais le récit est grave comme la mémoire de ce passé qu'on ne peut oublier."
2,Seems far more interesting as a concept than an actual execution,"If there is a 12 or 13th Edition to this book, give me a call.As it is, it looks like an interesting work of progress that someone prematurely released when they should have still kept it on the editors desk.It needs work. It needs lots and lots of work.It is fantastic as a premise, but in its current form it needs be resubmitted for a re-edit."
5,48.00 at Busch,"was in st.louis this spring, bought this same fitted hat for a nephnew and it cost $48, this was $18, great Christmas great price"
4,great CD!,"this is sadly the format's second and final full length record. sad because they just started to hit thier stride on this one. great sounding pop oriented smart catchy music and vocals. perhaps sounding slightly like bieber at times with hints of freddie mercury on occasion but way more cool then anything bieber's ever been associated with. The lead singer has since switched bands (Fun) and hit the big time. but this is where it all began. i highly recommend this to anyone that likes great, slightly indie pop music!"
5,Beyond Expectations,"I first heard some acoustic versions of the songs for DP several months ago. They were good, but I was a little concerned about how they would actually work out for an album. Turns out my fears were needless. The Format has come through again with a collection of songs that are simply amazing. They flow very well from one song to the next whether you play the CD straight through or randomly. That's not to say they all sound alike, because they don't. But they all fit together perfectly to create an album that exceeds expectations. The songs are arranged brilliantly and the guys sound like they're having the time of their lives making the album. I highly recommend this album."
3,"Not a sophomore slump, but not astounding","I definitely pre-ordered this CD back in the day - I was very excited for its release. Unfortunately, for me, it didn't quite hit the spot. I'm not sure if it's the slightly more polished sound or what that had me skipping through tracks - which is odd for me especially with The Format. Sadly, I enjoyed the demo & sample tracks from this album much better than the full release - they've made fantastic ringtones. If you're looking to buy your first Format release, don't start here. If you're looking to expand, give it a preview listen a few times first and buy it used."
4,Trustworthy,"First thing you may be thinking is, ""Oh it's used, should I buy it or perhaps spend more on a new one?"" Well it is all up to you but I'm here to say if you want to save some cash then used is not bad. I expected some damage on the CD but nothing, seems brand new, and the quality can't be beaten just like any other high quality album. I highly recommend it to anyone whom is a fan of The Format or just loves to buy CD's instead of downloading illegal copies. Oh and I almost forgot to mention that it my CD arrived ahead of time on a standard shipment so yeah, any other reason as of why not buy from this incredible & trusted seller?"
3,Eh...,"Interventions and Lullabies was amazing, hard to live up to. Dog Problems is a great album, but in comparison with the previous album, it really doesn't hold a candle. Dog Problems definitely has a different feel to it than Interventions, and it's good for bands to progress, but it has much more of a power-pop vibe.The songs are mostly all catchy, and the band experiments with different styles, which is interesting. Even when the lyrics are depressing, as they often are with The Format, the songs are still very upbeat."
3,"Oh, that's so pretty","From reviews and comparisons to other bands, I really had a different notion of what the music was really all about. There are some great harmonies and melodies. However, this is more of a modern folk/pop album with jangling guitars and pretty vocals. Not for everyone, but just something to keep in mind."
2,Why?,There first cd was amazing! It was heartfelt and straight forward power pop. This one leaves me feeling dry. A couple of good songs don't make an album. Buy the first one it's fantastic.
1,Crap mixed with more crap,"before you read what i have to say about dog problems, just so u know I loved format before this album. interventions and lullabies was an awesome cd. now there's dog problems. this cd is awful!!! it seems like the format couldnt write and decent song or come up more original songs like the ones in interventions. so they just use techno beats and lame sounds effects (the opening track has the song of a merry-go-round in the backround...LAME!!) i was waiting all year for this cd to come out and i am very disappointed! this cd is awful and turned me away from being a fan"
5,Great Mobile - Keeps son entertained,This mobile is a lifesaver. It is the only thing that keeps our 7 week old entertained. His eyes light up and he is very content watching it. The only drawback - and this probably applies to all mobiles - is that it seems to stop quickly and I have to rewind it. I think it loops through the medley twice and then stops. So I get a good... hmmm...5 minutes before I have to go rewind it.
4,Beautiful but simple,"This mobile is absolutely beautiful and baby loves it, but it doesn't last very long even on a full wind up and if you wind it too far you have to loosen the screws for it to work. However its great for the price and well worth buying."
4,Jazz for the holidays,Great Christmas album. The opening track really grabs your interest from the first sounds of the tympani. The kind of thing you could play at some wilder holiday parties and smile because you did.
5,I love this album,"This is the only Christmas album I will ever play. I grew up on this album, because my dad always played his vinyl copy at Christmans time, which he actually purchased in 1964. I'm glad to have a copy on CD now."
1,A treasure for seekers of the truth,"This is indeed a monumental work and takes us beyond the accumulated mistranslations into the realm of wisdom. Anyone who wonders at the chaotic thinking caused by a literal reading of Genisis will find real food for their inner self here. Joseph Campbell commented in ""Power of Myth"" about the problems caused in Western society by a literal reading of this profound book of wisdom. Shabaz Best was a deep scholar of not only the language used by the ancient sages but was a highly developed mystic. I have treasured both this book and the only other work by Shabaz Best that I have seen published in English : ""The Drama of the Soul"". This latter book is an uncovering of the deeper truths of the Gospel of Matthew and many odd things are similarly clarified.I urge all aspirants to a deeper understanding to try and obtain and study these books which really need to be made more available to all people."
1,NOT PALM COMPATIBLE,"Connects to your Microsoft Pocket PC and will not work with a Palm. If you mistakenly order, AMAZON.COM will not refund your shipping. Have a nice day."
3,Zaurus Users: This is the correct card (as of 3/2004),"Zaurus users, there is an ""old"" and a ""new"" version of this card. This is the older version, which is more expensive, but works out of the box with the current Zaurus Spectrum drivers available on myzaurus.com. The new version is the WL6004, which is B00012PS8G, but does not have Zaurus driver support as of 3/6/2004.Don't buy the cheaper, newer card unless you're convinced the drivers are available at the time you read this."
5,Excellent card and versatile software,"I use this card with my Compaq iPaq 3650 and with my Toshiba Tablet PC (running Windows XP), and it works great with both.Comparing it with the D-Link DCF-650W, the Socket card uses less power, has a longer range, is much smaller, and has better software.If you download the updated drivers/utilities from the Socket website, you get greatly increased functionality. With most cards,such as the D-Link, whenever you connect to a different wireless network, you have to re-enter all the encryption and IP settings. With the Socket utilities, you can set up configurations for several different networks, and it will automatically connect to whichever one is closest. I use it at home (using WEP encryption), at work (using 802.1x), and the local mall (no encryption), all seamlessly.And if you're wanting to cruise the neighborhood looking for ""hotspots"", this is still the card to get. Great product."
5,Basics of DNA testing,"The book covers useful basic approaches in paternity and genealogy testing, which are sometimes not explained even in biology textbooks. This book covers fundamental prinicpals of DNA work in this field. Highly recommed for purchase by those who want to learn the nuts and bold of all procedure involved in such tests. If you are a genealogist, lawyer, or just curious - this book will give you a very nice short but detailed overview of the techniques used in such type of work. The book is spiced with stories and examples."
1,This book is outdated and was published in 2000,I highly recommend purchasing any DNA and genealogy books written in 2003 and later as we come into 2004. This book is already outdated as it was published in 2000 and science has advanced with new cutting edge technology in DNA and genealogy testing and new interpretations.
4,"Powerful, beautiful and spiritual.",Powerful recreation of early music from an era when people truly believed their faith. Captures the spiritual consciousness of another time yet with a living zest. Would love to hear these people sing in an old church.
3,Easy to use,"This is my first mp3 player. I wanted something inexpensive to try out. It's very easy to use and I only paid $30 for mine. But once you get the hang of it you will want something a little more advanced. But beware, my light went out in about a month and the earplugs were uncomfortable, I bought new ones."
1,Piece of Junk,"It stopped working less than a week after I got it, and Philips customer support wants me to pay $30 shipping/handling fee to get it replaced."
5,Great,Fit well and wear well. They wash well and look good after. I would recommend them for any one. Good price and good feel.
2,Very slow shipping,"Unlike most sellers they take 10 business days just to ship unless you pay extra. I don't mind waiting a few days extra for delivery, but their failure to even register a tracking number makes it very difficult to know when to expect delivery of the product.I'm not disatisfied with the underwear, I don't expect great quality for the price. But this stuff will fall apart after only a few washings. All in all I'm not happy, I will not buy from NY Lingerie again."
3,Less quality than before,I regret to say that the Hane's quality has gone down hill. The fabric is not as thick and smooth as it was in previous years. The same size I bought before seems to run a size smaller now; it fits too tight and does not have the height from hip to waste that it used to have. I won't buy this brand anymore after this disappointing new development.
3,Not my favorite,"I honestly was expecting these panties to be more comfortable than they are. They're not actual briefs, more like hip-huggers and since I have a belly, they tend to roll down.I like the cotton version of these, but I won't buy this brand again."
3,not the same as before,"It seems like they are making these thinner than they used to. I also noticed while some fit fine, others in the package were cut smaller and didn't for as well."
3,Flimsy,"Bought these on sale. They are very flimsy, but the fit is right and so was the price. Remember the adage ""you get what you pay for""! At least the colors are fun."
3,TWO SIZES TO BIG,"I purchased these for myself, I am not a small woman so the idea of having underwear that won't show its lines through my clothes or ride up was a plus. I mainly go for cotton underwear to be practical but decided to get some a little more feminine- lacy and soft.Pros- they were soft and lacy- they were in pretty colorsCons- they were two sizes to bigEven though there is only one con to two pros, that one con outweighed the two pros hands down, so I ended up giving them to my mother. She loves them and plans to get more."
1,horrible product!,"Flimsy, slippery, and unpleasant feel. Old lady bloomers; not as pictured! The sizing must be unusual, because the small size I ordered (my usual size) swam on me. If I hadn't tried them on, I would have returned them STAT!!"
4,Hanes panties,"I like the undies. I've been wearing Hanes for years. However the colors I received were not the colors shone in the add. I'll keep them just the same. Contacted seller and she was very pleasant. May order from her again.Thanks,"
1,Fit is not the same,"I used to love these panties, they fit perfectly with very good coverage. I just ordered another pack and the size I usually wear was cut much too skimpy. I tried the next size up and they were better but still too skimpy and just not cut the same way. Must be outsourcing to another manufacturer. I'm very disappointed. Hate to order another size bigger and still not get what I bargained for."
2,Ill-Fitting Panties,"These panties looked good but just kept riding up--yuck! They must be seconds or something, I had to return them."
5,Track List,"Bing Crosby & Rosemary Clooney - Silver Bells Of Christmas / KRB / 1998 / /Track list:1} Silver Bells (Bing & Rosemary)2} White Christmas (Bing)3} Adeste Fideles (Bing)4} Rudolph, The Red-Nosed Reindeer (Bing)5} O' Little Town Of Bethlehem (Bing)6} Silent Night (Bing)7} The Christmas Song (Rosemary)8} Away In a Manger (Bing)9} It Came Upon A Midnight Clear (Rosemary)10} Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas (Rosemary)"
4,Take a bubble bath baby...,"WOW! My fav song is Bubble Bath -- the band is kind of alternative, kind of beck-ish, and really fun! This is an great band that's new to most of us and should definitely be entered into YOUR music collection!"
5,Ecseptional,This was the second battery I purchased. The first one I lost. The new battery is long lasting and last about three days with the phone being used medium frequency. Very impressed would definately recommend.
1,not the best,"I only paid 3 to 4 bucks for this. It appears brand new but won't hold a charge over a 24 hrs. I ended up puting my old battery back in. not worth the hassle to return it for what i paid for it. Possible I just got a bad one, i dont know. 5 stars to amazon they rock!"
1,If it sounds too good to be true...,"...it's because it is. I couldn't bring myself to spend $40 on this battery from Alltel, so I bought this one instead. It wouldn't even hold a charge as well as my old one. So now I've wasted time and a few bucks on shipping and I will still have to spend the $40 to get a good battery. Lesson learned."
1,Didn't work,"I bought this battery and was so excited... $5!! But I guess you get what you pay for. It fit perfectly and is the same battery that is in my phone, but my phone wouldn't even turn on when I put the bought one in."
1,Battery does not last,"After charging the battery over 18hrs, it lasted less than a day with minimal usage."
1,,"The battery was purchased for my cell phone, and sems like it is defective, the reason is the power doesnt hold too long."
3,Battery review.,"I purchased this battery for my cell phone thinking that it would solve the problem of my phone going down in battery quickly but it did not improve the longevity of my battery unfortunately. So I have since replaced my phone and that took care of the problem. The battery was fine, I believe. It was determined that it was not the answer to my problem."
1,Sent the wrong battery,Customer Service? - Lesson learned. I will only order books from Amazon from here on out. Could not find a customer service number. Pretty sure they just want our money. Not concerned about the customer at all. Another company that has gotten too big for its britches. I may stop shopping here all together. Pretty sick of large companies like this.
1,Bad Battery,This is a cell phone battery that drains fast for some unknown reason. I have to charge every 8 hours. Normally the battery lasts about 3 days. I am very disappointed this time!
5,"Mine works fine, am very pleased.","I bought this the second time I had to replace my cell phone's battery, and I am very pleased, because my previous replacement battery (an off brand one from Radio Shack) only had a 3 hour phone call time (which decreased quickly)...My new one that I got from Amazon has lasted for over 3.5 hours of phone calls and 3 days of being constantly on. I feel like I have a totally new phone!"
1,ripoff,"Bought three New OEM Lithium-Ion batteries which turned out to be not new. They won't hold charge more than a few hours, even in standby. They don't last any longer than the three year old after market batteries they were to replace. Obviously, they are a ripoff! The business is selling used batteries as new. The price and shipment was good, just not for the product. Don't want anything from these people again!"
5,BT50 Motorola battery,I bought 2 of these and they worked at least as well as the original that came with the cell phone.
1,ACC Stop sells junk batteries_ Do not purchase,I puchased this battery for my cell phone and it did not even last 3 months before it would only hold a charge for a few hours. When I contacted ACC Stop they refused to do anything about it. Normally batteries last at least 18 months.
1,It is what it is! (Updated 11/17/12),"What is there not to like? It's brand-new, cheap, cheap shipping and shipped to my house in 2 days from placing the order online! I desperately needed to replace this battery and it's nice to find that it's still available on the market and at a very cheap price! Once again Amazon comes through for me!***Updated 11/17/12I first wrote this review awhile back, spring I think. Since then I have purchased a new phone altogether, but while I was using this product throughout that period, I decided to update this review. Basically my review is going to repeat what everyone else here has already said. This battery is pure rubbish! Is started out decent at first, but by the time you get a couple of weeks into using it, you're lucky if it can even hold a charge for more than a day (not in use with calls) and no more than a few hours (in use with calls). I guess it's okay for $5 if you're desperate, but try to get something else instead."
3,doesn't stay charged very long...,Good price for what you get. T-Mobile charges almost $40 for same product. But my phone still needs to be plugged in every night. I don't think that is normal. It is possible that the problem is with the phone itself. Over all it was a bargain.
2,It's ok....not the best.,"I don't know why, but the original battery was thicker. Even though it's otherwise identical! I think our phone must be messed up or just draws a bunch of juice because this battery only seems to last 1 day under normal use in our Motorola W315. I'm thinking it's just our phone because they even sent me another one and still the same problem."
1,You get what you pay for,"My son had a problem with his phone (not related to the battery) shortly after getting this battery. While checking out the phone, the Cellcom tech immediately noticed something fishy about the battery. He noticed it was bulging slightly and questioned where the battery came from. He said the cells inside were coming apart or something like that and this is what was causing the case to bulge. He ended up needing a new phone so I will never know how long this battery would have lasted. Either way, it's money down the drain."
4,Another answer to question below,"Bugs did the ""cops surrounding the house"" routine in an earlier cartoon called ""Racketeer Rabbit,"" 1946, directed by Friz Freleng. In this one, the gangsters are caricatures of Edward G. Robinson (""Rocky"") and Peter Lorre (""Hugo""). Instead of an oven, Rocky is put into a steamer trunk and subjected to the ""would I do this if my good friend Rocky were in there"" treatment, which includes swords and a bomb. Rocky's clueless line ""What a pal, what a pal, what a pal"" is priceless."
3,Obvious shorts are STILL MISSING!,I admire these shorts BUT - is there anyone else out there that is still missing some of the best Bugs Bunny cartoons? I would think shorts such as (Pardon my ignorance -I do not know the actual names of the shorts):* Robin Hood Daffy (Yikes & AWAY!)* The Bugs with the vampire - (Pocus-cadabra)* Bugs and Mugsy (I don't know how yous done it - but I know yous done it!!)* Bugs and Yosemite - RETREAT! (Cannon firing back and forth)* ANY Foghorn Leghorn....* More Marvin the Martianetc.!
5,Amazing Chuck Jones and his Looney Toons!,"Already bought Volume 1 and HAD TO BUY this Volume # 2!If you admire the talents of Chuck Jones and Mel Blanc, and enjoy collecting great treasures on DVD, you MUST have these.Excellent quality, great price, and lots of laughs and many happy memories. What a wonderful experience for our kids to finally watch REAL cartoons!"
4,Looney Tunes review-2,I have already published few words about volume-1. The same comment is applicable to this volume also. As a personsl comment I would say that it would have been better if cartoons are published randomnly in each DVD. Ofcourse contents of some DVDs are in random. May be it is for economic package that DVDs are bundled in one package.Liyakkathali Mooppan
5,a must have for looney toon lovers,I bought this for Christmass gift. The entire family loved it1! Including extended family. We sat for hours watching all the great classics. A must have for Looney-Tune lovers. Highly recommended.
5,Amazing collection!!,"I got these dvd's for my mom for her birthday because she used to watch them as a kid and it just brings back wonderful memories for her. She watches them every weekend and my son who is 4 has become a fan as well and that just makes her day. He runs around quoting all the characters! These dvd's just bring back feel-good memories for all ages whether you're 44, 24 or 4!"
4,Another great Looney Tunes DVD set,"I purchased this set after running through volume 1 enough with my daughter that we were ready for some new episodes. This is another great set, with some classic episodes that were left off of volume 1 and some generally zany and surrealistic ones, many of which I have never seen before. I didn't like this one as well as volume 1 for a couple of reasons: 1) too many cartoons with the same characters on each DVD. I prefer when they get mixed up, rather than sitting through a bunch of Tweety and Sylvesters all in a row. And 2) too many cartoons that have obscure references (such as old Hollywood stars and popular literature from the early 20th century) that kids just won't get -- and you probably won't either. If you don't have volume 1, get that one. If you do, then go ahead and get this one. It is a worthy addition to your cartoon library!"
3,Looney Tune Buff,The product is great. Too bad we paid over $40 for it. The really sad thing was the original price tag was still on it. Almost 40% cheaper. I guess that's what supply and demand is all about.
5,As promised....,The product shipped the day after ordering and arrived exactly the day it was projected to do so. Great job guys! Keep up the good work and i will keep the orders coming. Thanks again.
5,Great DVD set!,This is a great set. You must buy it. I especially liked disc 4 because of all of the classic cartoons.
5,Old Glory,"I don't know if Brian Duggins was trying to be funny or was actually being serious (scary thought), but the ""under god"" thing wasn't originally in the pledge of allegiance, written in 1892. It got tacked on in 1954. The cartoon Old Glory was made in 1939. So, um, yeah."
5,GOOD STUFF,I bought it expecting good classic old school Looney Toons cartoons and thats exactly what i got. Only thing I wish they had was more DVDs in this box for this price...best deal you will find.
3,Good,"Grouping all tweety or all road runner together is not quite as good as watching the mix up on Saturday mornings. It's actually a little less entertaining, though some great episodes were included in this set."
5,THe best cartoons ever.,My family and I love the cartoons the best ever made .We plane on buying more in the near future.
5,As good as I remember,"These are the real, original cartoons I saw as a kid. I bought them for my own kids, but found myself watching with them every time."
4,"Nice collections, but I'd love to see sets devoted to one","Such as one Daffy-only set.Or one Road Runner-only set.One Bugs set.One set compiling ALL of the characters is a cram job.Besides, a character-devoted collection seems to give each character more honor, and focus.But, and I hate to say it, I will buy the collection sets if there is no other way. The extras are very nice (I netflixed this set)"
3,Restored? Not really...,"...I have just watched disc four (the one with ""What's Opera, Doc?"") and I am applalled at the low quality of the prints: speckles, dirt, scratches have been retained when it would have been relatively easy to remove them. Too bad."
5,looney tuney,A fun collection. The grandkids love these and they are used before the feature movie in our prison ministry. The guys love it. Just like the movies or Saturday morning...
3,Definite Improvement,While I really enjoy volume 2. Daffy Duck for president is the best. I was really disappointment that there wasn't more Bugs Bunny/Yosemite Sam. I would to see that in Volume 3. But overall if you are die-hard looney tunes fan. You will love this DVD.
4,Fun. Fun. Fun.,"Fun. Fun. Fun. There was a lot of stuff on disc 4 I wasn't so happy with...but it's still great to be able to see them. ""Hello My Baby, Hello My Honey, Hello My Ragtime Gal."" I would have bought the set just to get this last one. Wonderful cartoons."
4,"Not bad, but some great cartoons still missing....","I was more impressed with Looney Tunes-Golden Collection, Vol. 1, but this is a nice batch of episodes. The solid Roadrunner and Coyote disc is a little hard to get through however, but that's personal preference....even if they were the simplest of the LT cartoons, but I digress. I was very pleased to see Bunny Hugged, What's Opera Doc, and Hyde and Hare again.If there's going to be a Vol. 3, I really miss Bushy Hare. People consider it a risque cartoon, but come on, folks; It was funny then and it's still funny now. Grow a sense of humor and learn to distinguish what is meant to be truly insulting. ""Risque cartoons,"" sheesh. Only in America. Other great hits that are distinctly missing from the Golden Collection so far are the classic Hare Brush, Racketeer Rabbit, and a personal fave: It's Hummer Time. ""Not the rain pipe!"""
5,Nice Index Cards.,I bought these index cards for a friend and I to start a recipe booklet for ourselves and our friends and these cards work great. They are nice and big and easy to write on. I like these cards.
3,My Favorite Bride,"I really didn't care for this book. The ""Hero"", Colonel William Gregory was a jerk, plain and simple. The character didn't show any real caring for his children and certainly not for the heroine, Samantha Prendregast. In my opinion, Miss Prendregast's character was the only good thing about this book. She was very likeable. It is a shame that the author paired her with William's character. The Samantha character is the only reason I gave this book the rating of 3 stars, otherwise it would have been 1 star."
3,"Hmmm..., this story is familiar....",This book is the first Christina Dodd book I ever read and I can't say its the best one yet. The story is just like the one in Sound of Music. I hope the book Lost in your arms will be a better read then this one!
2,Isn't this getting a bit cliche?,"If you're one of Dodd's old readers and have read her previous book, you'd know what i'm talking about. I mean, at first, the governess and lord plot was interesting and somewhat refreshing. But after basing her last 6 books on this governess-lord plot, don't you think that it is quite enough? I mean, the first 3, ""Rules of Attraction"", ""Rules of Engagement"" and ""Rules of Surrender"" were pretty good, but then I got kind of weary of this plot, and then it just all became a formula. I know Dodd is a very talented writer, but after 6 books, don't you think she should just take a break and start on something else? It's like the Cynster, after the first 6 books, the rest just seems like a formula."
5,Grabbed me from the start!,"This is the 1st book review I've done. I just had to share how much I enjoyed this book. It's also the 1st Governess Brides book I've read by Ms. Dodd but it certainly won't be the last. It just grabbed me right from the start and kept me completely entranced through to the end. It was smart, sexy, and funny. Both Samantha & William were flawed characters, which I love. The sex scenes were hot! The children and the secondary characters were delightful. With Ms. Dodd's perfectly descriptive writing, you can picture it all. I am purchasing another book in this series immediately!"
3,"This is like copying ""The Sound of Music""","Not original at all. I can't believe I paid for this. I like her books but first it was a re-make of ""Sabrina"" and now ""The sound of music"". As much as I enjoyed this book I was still disapointed that she borrowed the plot from another book which is a classic."
2,Not Up To Snuff,"While I usually love Christina Dodd's books, this one left me rather empty. I didn't know going into it that it was an homage to ""The Sound of Music"" and felt that the parallels were hamfisted at best. I plan to read the others in this series, just to get a comparison - and I remain hopeful that they will prove better than this one. If you want to read a story for an afternoon's diversion that you do not have to think about, this is the one."
2,Favorite Bride--Nasty Groom,"I have read many of Christina Dodd's books, and like most of the other reviews believe she should steer clear of movie plots and try a little harder to be original. However, this is not why I didn't like this book. Although it was a quick, fast read--I didn't like the relationship with the two main characters. I felt like William was too easily forgiven. He was a JERK and didn't deserve the quick forgivness. I don't expect a lot of realistic stuff in my romance novels, but no way I would have forgiven him so quickly. This took away from the book and from the heroine. All in all this book annoyed me."
3,Not quite ready for prime-time,"The hero, Colonel Gregory, must have been a terrible commander, because he had absolutely no control over his emotions, made snap decisions based on no evidence, had no insight into anyone else's feelings and had a terrible sense of timing. Several of the major love scenes had more than a hint of inappropriate force that I felt bordered on repugnant. The heroine, Samantha, was kind of typical - you know, one kiss and she's in love...(yawn). Dodd's work is usually not so shallow, hopefully her next won't disappoint."
1,The Sound of Music?,"Ms. Dodd is one of my favorite writers, but I didn't enjoy this book at all. Although well written in her usual style, I found the obvious ""borrowing"" from the Von Trapp family in rather poor taste. These were *real* people. This wasn't a fairytale. I recently read ""Lair of the Lion"" from Christina Feehan and I wasn't at all bothered by her ""Beauty and the Beast"" story because it not the same thing.If Ms. Dodd wanted to use this story she darn well should have acknowledged it in the credits. I was absolutely *floored* to read her ""Any resemblance to actual events is purely coincidental."" How on earth do you put that on a book that is obviously is anything but?Unless you like *real people* fanfiction, or haven't had the pleasure of seeing ""The Sound of Music,"" I don't suggest you waste your money on this."
3,Not bad :),"I liked Samantha, her spirit, her determination, the way she dealt with the girls. I also liked William. And I liked the governess premise. But after a while, Samantha started to be... I don't know, childish, inexperienced, naive? And sometimes I had the feeling that William was using her - because he was an important man, and she was just his employee. The spying business was a bit over the top, as usual. I loved Duncan and Teresa's story and would love to read more about them. All in all, this was a nice afternoon read with a few flaws that can easily be overlooked."
3,good for a beginner,"I think this was an excellent book for a person starting to plan a catering business--minus the large recipe section. It tells you exactly what to expect in this business, and includes helpful sample forms (i.e.billing, invoice) that will surely come in handy. In addition, Halvorsen includes helpful lists for restaurant schools,wholesale markets,kitchen suppliers, etc. for many cities throughout the US. Definitely worth the book price and recommended for someone who is starting out or even thinking of starting a business in the industry because she tells it like it is!"
1,Catering like an idiot,"This book is a collection of vague and uninformative quotes, dated menus, and common sense advice. One word for Ms Halvorsen, ICE. The details of coffee and tea service are poured over, yet, at no time does the book remind the would-be caterer to buy ice! It is amazing that in such a competitive publishing world that books like this are written."
3,One great movie and one very bad movie,"Please don't buy this set, at least not if you don't already know both movies well.The sophisticated ""Silence Of The Lambs"" is one of the greatest thrillers ever made, but the gory, superficial ""Hannibal"" is not worthy to be mentioned in the same breath. Get ""Lambs"" and its prequel ""Red Dragon"", and leave ""Hannibal"" alone."
5,great costume,"my grandson loved it and his father had one just like it, they went as a pair of ugly zombies to a Halloween party. thank you"
5,My 8 year old son LOVED it!,"We got many compliments on this costume! It looked great for the price! We live overseas and many of the costumes available to us are expensive, with little to them. This one was around the same price and MUCH more costume!"
3,Zombie Complete Child Costume,Didn't last long for the price of the costume. Tore in one day. Now in the garbage. Cheaply made.
2,Even glasses won't improve the poor image quality!,"If its audio only you want be sure to buy a CD of either of these notable performers(I have multiple CDs by both artists and have seen Phil ""live"" twice). However, if you purchase a DVD you most likely want to have a visual experience as well. Unfortunately, this DVD's video quality is not up to industry standards. While the content and performances are adequate on the limited number of tracks, the lighting and camera work is poor. I've only seen one other video with worse image quality and that was Barry Manilow's first DVD release(yes, I have versatile taste). He has since redeemed himself with a top quality release and Dave & Phil may want to consider doing the same. This DVD should be offered at a substantial discount or simply pulled from the shelves until a quality product can be offerd."
1,Do NOT buy this DVD! very poor quality,"I got this DVD as a gift, and it's a very disappointing DVD. The picture quality is so poor that I took it back to the store the very same day. The lighting on the show was poor too! and they called it 5.1 Surround Sound?? not even close!I immediatelly exchanged it with Jim Brickman's DVD. I will NOT recommend this DVD to anyone. If you like Dave Koz, better off getting the CD."
1,all,"i bought htis DVD from shawnek on 18th November 2010, up to now i have never received it.Is there no other seller for this album??"
5,PHIL & DAVE THE BEST,hAVE YOU SEEN THESE TWO IN CONCERT. Get your tickets to the most live exprience on dvd. PHIL PERRY AND DAVE KOZ.Love Luther
2,blah,"Actually 2 and 1/2 stars. I agree with two of the reviewers below that Ms. Carter is better in concert than on this record, but I seem to be more disappointed than they with the difference. Her playing here is restrained, simplistic, detached, unemotional. Her violin's tone sounds boxy. There is a profusion of ""guest stars"" here and no sense of a band cohering. (Her real pianist is better than Kenny Barron.) I could go on, but I think you get the idea: this is a commercially compromised, timid, halting, uninspired effort.I can only recommend you see the real Regina Carter in concert, and in the mean time pick up these two jazz records featuring violin: The Mahavishnu Orchestra's ""Birds of Fire"" and Shakti's ""Natural Elements""."
3,"Good overall camera, but poor low light performance","I have purchased this camera due to its optical stabilization and high iso capabilities since most of the pictures I take are indoor and I rather not use the flash.The optical stabilization works fine, but the pictures I've taken in low light conditions were too dark. If you have some experience you have the freedom to adjust and improve the pictures quality but, when in automatic, I was a bit disappointed with the performance.For general use, it is a very nice camera, very small, fast with good color balance."
2,Digital Camera,The carrying case is nice and it came on time but the digital camera didn't so I had to return both.We paid for express shipment and they shipped it ground. The camera came when we were gone. My husband had to buy a new camera. Please credit our Credit card.
3,Panasonic camera OK,"Takes gd pics, but big prob is no eyepiece viewfinder. U have to use the screen on the back of the camera, and if bright out, U can't really see what U are shooting."
5,Piano Works 1,Piano Works 1 is the first in the series of recordings (1992) of Bela Bartok's music by pianist Zoltan Kocsis. Philips Classics once more sets the standard high by having absolutely stunning sound quality and one verily feels as if one is listening to this recording in person. Andras Willheim has written the music notes. Indeed a very pleasant recording. Highly recommended. 5/5.
5,Adem Who?,"I have no idea who Adem Tepedelen is, nor do I care. This album is great, fun, catchy and true to the ""country"" spirit. And it will be remembered and enjoyed long after Adem Tepedelen is forgotten, which really isn't saying much."
5,Real men do praise God !!!!!!!,"when searching for some real true worship and praise music I look for some old traditional hymns and while listening to Donnie McClurkin , I got just what i wanted from the Lord ! if you are a true gospel fan this is the CD to get , you will be amazed at how the ANNOINTING flows through out the house, the car , and the sanctuary ! If you dont know Jesus this young man will truly make you run and find out who Jesus is !! Donnie McClurkin I Thank God for you !! GRACE AND PEACE, Love to the saints"
5,Excellent compilation of straight from the heart tunes,Donnie McClurkin's voice is illustrious. The lyrics are captivating.
4,He has spoken,"I heard Donnie sing ""Speak to my heart"" when he was with the New York Restoration Choir and was in awe of his powerful voice and straight forward message. I could not wait to purchase his solo album to really enjoy Donnie......"
5,THIS IS PRAISE AND WORSHIP,"THe first time I heard Donnie McClurkin he was on TBN singing ""Stand"" that song touched me so I called in to TBN to find out who he was.It took me weeks to finally get the CD because the stores were always sold out.When I heard the whole CD I couldnt stop listening to it (I still do).This CD has gotten me through so much.Thank GOD for Pastor Donnie McClurkin."
1,Want my money back!,"I purchased this item in October of last year and has yet to receive my CD. I want my money back or a CD sent to me immediately. If I had known that this would take this long, I would have never ordered it."
4,Agatha Christie Enthusiast,"DAVID SUCHET captures the personage of Poirot exactly as Christie characterized him. He is excellent. Though the series can deviate sometimes from the written stories, they are the next best thing to reading the books that you can get.I highly recommend them. I have almost all of the series and I continually watch them repeatedly. They are a worthy investment."
2,Heavy Fins,"Purchased these fins a year ago to do some snorkeling in Florida. I found them to be very heavy, and not nearly as comfortable as the old full-foot Voit fins I replaced. The rubber foot cup is very rigid, and The ribs on the outer edge of the fins are large and dense, which contributes to the weight. I also had problems with the heel strap slipping off. I had to concentrate on swimming without bending my ankles to keep the fins on. Tightening the heel strap only seemed to make the fins more uncomfortable. If you are interested in a good fin, I would look for one with a full foot cup that's soft and pliable."
4,"Uplifting movie about friendship, relationships, and responsibilities","In Buddy, a trio of friends find themselves selected to produce a reality television show about their antics. It becomes popular, and this popularity tugs at the roots of their friendship. Trust erodes, and relationships become tattered. Is success defined as money and popularity, or something else?In Norwegian, with English subtitles."
1,"didn't work, had to return","the movie itself is great, I purchased it after watching it on netflix. Unfortunately, the dvd didn't work at all. I tried it on 3 players. I contacted the company and they didn't have a replacement. Fortunately, a Norwegian friend of mine enjoys re-enacting scenes from the movie at dinner parties. Less fortunately, I don't speak Norwegian."
5,Mesmerizingly beautiful,"Recently someone helped himself to, among other things, a huge stack of CDs from our home. This CD is among our top-three list of immediate replacements."
3,Belisario by Donizetti,"I found two recordings of this opera online. Although neither of them are high quality recordings, this was the better of the two, so I downloaded it. My primary complaint is that there is a three second glitch in the sound at the 1 minute mark in the overture. Other than that, I got what I expected, which is an acceptable recording of an enjoyable opera."
3,Info on the Bel warranty issue,"Based on the reviews here about the Beltronics warranty issues, I called Beltronics just now and asked them ""what it would cost to have an out-of-warranty 965 repaired"".Answer: $59.95 (which includes return shipping).Next question: ""If I buy a second one for my wife's car from amazon, is is covered under warranty as being purchased from an 'authorized reseller'?""Answer: Well, you have to watch out for resellers who sell through amazon, they get detectors from store closeouts and such...I said, ""No, I mean if I buy from amazon itself. Is it covered?""Answer: Yes, amazon itself is an authorized reseller, and you'll be covered.I don't know if the company rep was blowing smoke, but that's what he said. If he was truthful, then the detectors that Bel wouldn't cover under warranty were bought from an independent seller doing business through amazon, NOT amazon itself."
4,Great product for the price.,"Great product for the price. It gives me enough notice to be able to check my speed and slow down if I need to(considering the terrain). I leave my detector on the ""autoscan"" mode. This does cause it to alert around automatic doors. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good, less expensive radar detector."
4,Beltronics V965 Vector Radar and Laser Detector,This is a pretty inexpensive radar detector so I really wasn't expecting much. Very surprisingly it is an excellent detector. I is giving me fewer false alerts that the passport I just gave up on that failed after only 14 months. I decided I wasn't going to spend close to $300.00 again on a detector. The advance notice it gives me with KA and Laser is just as good as the passport was. I'm very pleased with this detector. The only negative is the suction cups mounting system isn't very dependable in hot weather.Beltronics V965 Vector Radar and Laser Detector (Black/Silver)
4,Does the work!,"This is a great product for the price. I get a lot of false alarms but that's because I probably need to disable x band... most garage openers and automatic doors trigger the radar... I have yet to see police using x-band around my area. I did not notice a difference between highway/city but you get used to it.... the difference led intensities are good and stealth mode is superb. You get used to it, this will alert you of real threats."
1,Detectors okay - Service is is the worst around,"The detector had been in use less then 6 months when it died. Sent it back for warranty repair (1 year warranty) and they indicated it was out of warranty because I bought it from an un-authorized dealer. Yet they do not list who is authorized to sell it. If you purchase one you better make sure they are authorized to sell it or you will get no support from Beltronics. They leave it up to the consumer to take on this risk. It would be one thing if they had a list of resellers on their web site, but they don't. They want you to call them to find out if the reseller it authorized before you purchase. I have never dealt with a company like this. They indicated that they did not know how the un-authorized sellers are getting the products so it becomes a customer issues (they did confirm the unit I shipped them was a real Beltronics detector).There are other detectors out there that are as good or better. I would not purchase another one from them."
5,Best value for your money,"I bought total of 3 units for each of my 3 cars. It is best value for under $100. Most cops uses Ka band these days. The range depends on the angle of the radar gun from the patrol car. I would said between 4 blocks to a mile for Ka band. The unit will sniff out X and K band with even greater range. I owned a V1 before (sold it after sold one of my car). awesome unit if you have the $$$. I don't encourage people to blow through 100+ mph on the highway. But the unit will save you from speed trap set by police on sudden speed limit drop from 40 to 25 zone. I think most of low ratings on this unit was due to warranty claim issues or from individual cop who expresses his opinion against owning of a radar detector. Peformance wise should be 4 or higher rating. I give it a 5 since they already save me on several of occasions. I hope this unit will save you from speed traps, too."
1,Finally stopped working. Received full refund.,The detector never stopped alerting me. It was constantly going off and there were never any radars in sight. All of sudden it died and never went off anymore. That was after only about 6 weeks. I returned it for full refund. Need I say more. The product I received must have been faulty.
2,Ok Detector,"The Beltronics V965 works well detecting a radar source. However, it didn't pick up photo enforced intersection, police car, or highway patrol car. The manual says the reason it wouldn't detect a patrol car is because they've turn their radar off. Basically, your Beltronic won't tell you if there is patrol car near by unless they have their radar on. I had some false alarms too. It went off every time you drive by a store front entrance. (Target store). I had false alarms on highways as well as residential areas. The unit is only good for detecting speed traps. If you have a lot of these speed trap encounters in your normal driving routes, the Beltronics will work for you."
1,Unacceptable customer service,"This is not a review for Mastch VC9805A, but rather a review of experience with Kaito electronics.In short - I would not trust anything they say.After receiving an item I did not order (was not even Mastech brand) I filed a claim with Amazon, because Kaito customer service representative was very rude.In response to my comment Kaito posted a statement that item I received was not wrong.Just a day or two prior to that they sent me an e-mail clearly stating that item I ordered was discontinued; that is why I received an ""improved"" version.Amazon was on top of things and I would not hesitate using it over and over again."
2,Not Worth The Money But Lots Of Pictures,"I purchased ""Prison Tattoos"" to study gangs and their tattoos. Being interested in law enforcement and part owner of a tattoo shop this book caught my eye. The intro is about 8 pages followed by 60-70 pages of pictures some fuzzy and crude. The post script is one more page. Lots and lots of pictures of work. But at about a dollar a page of writing, this is a mighty expensive book with little information. Good buy if found of the sale rack or used."
4,Glad They Were Online,"It's amazing how tough it was to find this color and style of card. I went to at least three local office supply stores looking for blue 5x8 index cards. Thank goodness I found them on Amazon. The price seems to be a little steep, but I paid it, so I guess it's an acceptable price point."
3,Nice but Pricey,"These blue unlined cards are just like the ones David Letterman uses--if you like that sort of thing, and I do. Too expensive, though."
5,WHERE HAS LAURIE LEWIS BEEN ALL MY LIFE?,"This in absolute brillant bluegrass CD! I have listened to it hundreds of times. I never get tired of it. The harmony is superb and Laurie's clear and true country voice is a wonder to behold. I'm so glad I found this CD and Laurie Lewis, plan to add more of her to my bluegrass collection."
5,Best New Group!,The first time i ever herd Lost Witness i fell in love with it. They are a really good group with good beats and the lead singer rocks!i suggest that they should make a full cdbuy this single it Rocks!
5,"Great introduction, great series","Vandread is such a fun series to watch. The setting, which sees women and men separated between two warring planets, is just great for hilarious scenarios and good gags. The first season of Vandread (the first 13 episodes) stands very well by itself, and sets the stage for a great second season (which is currently running in Japan). This first volume is a great introduction to a really fun series."
5,The best anime!,"Vandread is an cool sci-fi anime, ""A Must Buy"". Excellent drawings and cool mecha design! If you like mechas, extreme fights and full speed. Then is Vandread for you."
5,sci fi hip space opera!,"my only complaint is that there are too few episodes released at a time. this is a wonderful series with great potential women vs men and yet both are faced with the fact that they need each other to survive! the cute humor and kiddie typepranks all play well - it gives the series a ligh hearted action tone, with interesting sexual tensions n conflicts.well dont just sit there rentit; then buy it!God bless"
3,vg,Hot chicks and giant robots what else do you want! Nice charaters and special effects! I'll probally wind up buying the whople series.
2,You get what you pay for!,"I am not very picky when it comes to what I cook with, but these are total garbage. They seem to be coated with gallons of Teflon, yet the food still stuck to the pan. (Yes, cooking spray was used.) They also scratch easily. The handles on the pot feel insecure, and whenver I use it I'm a little afraid that they're going to fall off and scalding hot water will spill on my feet. Very disappointing. For another $10-$20, you can get much better. I also feel this item was overpackaged, with three boxes and TONS of styrofoam chips spilling out all over my apartment. I'm trying to shrink my carbon footprint here!"
2,Interesting -- but buy it used,"The Lanchester Strategy graphic series of books are interesting but lack depth. The books' focus is really on Sales. Forget Marketing -- you won't find it here. Also, old-school Japanese graphic novel approach weakens the message. There is little meat; however, it offers some relatively useful high-level information.Seasoned sales managers should ignore this -- but if you are new to the game, go ahead and buy them -- used."
2,the comic book,"i found this book to be less than good. It was vague and unsubstantial, having little basis or factual backup for its forthputs and explinations. It was not really what i had expected but well laid out, and with a many decent pictures."
3,Only for the Serious Vegetarian,"This cookbook is no doubt a joy for devoted vegetarians. The recipes comprise an excellent collection of very low fat recipes aimed specifically for holidays. As many vegetarians know, it is extremely difficult to find no meat recipes for special occasions. However, these recipes are not only for vegetarians, but also for health conscious celebrants.My only complaint would be that most non-vegetarians (such as myself) will find the recipes rather skimpy and lacking the hearty flavors of holidays. I personally would rather indulge during holidays and watch my health on the other days!Whether it be used for holiday ideas or everyday meals, this book certainly has merit for certain cooks."
5,This is a great collection!,"I purchased this bedskirt (and the coordinating quilt, sham and sheet set) for my 2 year old's ""big girl bed"". The colors are vibrant and brighten the room. I would recommend this collection for any little girl's room...we love it!"
2,"Lovely pictures, disappointing content","The pictorial examples of of Quilts in Bloom are beautiful. However, very little of the book is devoted to techniques and they are pretty basic. From the cover I would have expected more intricate patterns included that play off the images of the quilts in the book. There are many, many more books on this subject that have more to offer. Glance through it and leave it at the store (or website)."
2,This is the most money I've waisted in a long time.,"This sure looked like it was going to be a great book. Boy was I wrong. It doesn't have any information at all. I could have lived with that and used it as a coffee table book because it does have alot of pictures, but the pictures are not very good. You cannot see any of the quilting lines and the pictures just aren't clear enough."
5,quilts in bloom,"I find that Quilts in Bloom is a great book ,it has a lot of information in itAlso it tells you how all the tecneique's and has plenty of photos and diagrams of how to do itI would recommend this book for anyone who is interested in Applique"
4,Works with Zaurus SL-5600,"Works right out of the box with the Zaurus SL-5600, as advertised (unlike the Targus 56K Pocket CF Modem). Too bad it's more than twice the cost!"
1,Bad color,"I was looking for RED index cards. Although the front of the card looks more pink, I thought that the sides and the back might be darker. Nope, they are pink. The color ""cherry"" is not accurate to me."
5,Classic Chiaco Blues,Its like being in Chicago at the height of the blues scene. He plays many classic tunes and some originals.
1,Don't waste your money,"If you have any faux painting experience at all do not waste your money buying this DVD. First of all, the guy teaching it is not very good at it. There are few closeups of color mixing, which I think is the most important, and the segments are wayyy too long. It's an amateur production at the very least."
5,"crisp, clean, revelatory playing","This disc is on my Desert Island selection. Her playing of these canonical Bach pieces is like the cleaning of the Sistine Chapel. Unlike the Szeryng (who I also adore), who conquers the formidable Channone like some Central European mountaineer scaling the craggy Alps, Mullova attacks them with grace and levity. The complex fugues are now a matrix of refracted light and mathematics, the dances quickfire and brisk, and slow movements sweet and never sentimental. She has obviously learned something from the period instruments, and yet kept the weight and rich sound of the modern violin.In his manifesto ""Six Memos for the Millenium,"" Italo Calvino pronounced six requirements of fiction: lightness, quickness, exactitude, visibility, and multiplicity. Somehow Mullova embodies all of these in this superlative recording."
5,chef-d'oeuvre,"The cover says it was recorded at St George's, Brandon Hill, Bristol, UK in 8/1992 (BWV 1006) and 6/1993. The previous reviewer indicated it was done in early 1980s.Regardless, this magnificent recording is a great therapy for my heart and excellent gymnastics for my brain. A mandatory aquisition."
5,We need more books like this!,JANE'S WARLORD is an awesome story that I didn't want to put down! I loved every minute it from the first page to the last. The love scenes were just what the doctor ordered. Very hot and very yummy! I'd sure love to come home and find a sexy Warlord waiting for me! If you like your romance books full of action and steamy love scenes with characters that you actually care about then this book is a must buy. Angela Knight is an author not to be missed! She's an automatic buy for me!
5,Loved it!,"Love it! I read this book in one sitting. That's right! Great story, Great Characters, and Great sex!I rate this book, 10 stars**********"
1,disappointing,"all this book needed is ""Once upon a time....."" I was thoroughly fooled by the other reviews when deciding to purchase this book. I do realize that there has to be imagination in storytelling but this book is in the running with a horny twilight zone episode with no plausable ending ever in site."
3,ho-hum...,"After reading Sherrilyn Kenyon, I just wasn't that impressed. I am hoping that her ""Master"" books are more exciting. I thought the hero was okay, but certainly nothing I haven't seen before and the heroine had some funny moments. Maybe I am just too jaded with this genre of Romance. I think I would have liked this book a lot more had I read it before I read everything else in the alpha-male genre."
4,"An Erotic, Sci-fi romp","Angela Knight blends blistering erotic romance with sci-fi action in this delightful book. Jane Colby is horrified when a murderer strikes in her tight-knit community. But the surprises have just begun. An autocratic warrior, Baran, arrives from the future to ""protect"" Jane and hunt the killer.Borrowing a bit too much from The Terminator, this book is still wildly entertaining and ultimately satisfying."
5,Hot! Hot!! Hot!!!,This book was amazing!! It was the first book I read from Angela Knight and I can't wait to read her next one. Definitely a must have!
3,Lacked depth but plenty a cream,"Jane's Warlord was a suggested read from the previous opinions on Amazon. I did like the intensity of the story-line, where the hero had to constantly fight to keep women from being killed- and the love scenes were raunchy as promised..., but the word cream was so overused it was just too irksome. ""taste cream"", ""she creamed"", everybody ice-cream, it was just so dumb after awhile. I did think it was an okay book because Jane was strong, and feisty, and the hero was strong and uncompromising. It went a little quick though. I'm a die hard fan of sci-fi romance, and for my money nothing has come close to Dara Joy's Matrix series, or Lindsay's Warrior series for touching, and sexually on fire read. I keep pursuing distant runner-ups though- Knight has some talent- I'd give her other books a try if pressed."
5,The hottest time travel I've ever read,"After so many takes on the theory of time travel, it's hard to rad one that comes across as fresh, but Angela Knight did that and more, with this kick [back] heroine and a hero to just die for.The Warlords are an amazing creation and jane sure as hell knows how to handle hers, and be handled...Steamy hot, and full of lust, love, and intrigue, this is one book I'm gonna have to keep two of. The first one is already showing wear, and I'll be reading...and re reading...over and over."
5,A terrific book from a great author!,What can I add to what's been said? I love Angela Knight's work as not only extremely erotic but also managing to build the characters that you care about them. This one is terrific and I am ecstatic to see her publishing full novels! Yeah and I look for more of Ms. Knight's works!
3,3.5 stars. Interesting read.,"I can't put my finger on it, but I would have liked something a little more creative or different about the plot and storyline. I didn't like that the warlord was not given enough tools by his superiors to properly fight Druas. They had an explanation for this in the end, but I didn't like it. Other parts of the ending were interesting and good. Although it is not a favorite, I did enjoy the book and plan to try another from this author.Sexual content: strong. Setting: current day small town in U.S. Copyright: 2004. Genre: time travel science fiction romance.For a list of my reviews of other Angela Knight books, see my 2 star review of ""The Forever Kiss"" posted 9/09/08."
5,So Good You won't want to put it down,"This book was so good that I didn't want to put it down. I even got up early on a Sunday morning so I could finish it. It has everything you could want in a story. Conflict, romance, heat. I would recommend this book to everybody."
1,Derails rather than sidetracks!,"Nowadays it is fashionable, financially necessary and sometimes intriguing for musical performers to ""cross over"".This is a case of a true flop. Every musical performer is top notch, but the jarring effect of Ms. Kanawa's style together with that of the jazz trio is close to painful. With an orchestral background like the ones one gets with Sinatra or Streisand, her renditions could have been quite enjoyable, but with this mismatch only masochists need apply."
2,Not such a good deal after all,"I thought 'what a great deal' and I got this, installed it, and am now pretty disappointed. The cable housing is way to long for my bike and comes pre-assembled so you can't easily cut it down and the cable sticks in the housing so when I use my back brake I have to physically pull the back brakes apart so they don't rub on the rim while I am riding."
4,A great story,"I was not sure about this type of book, but after I began to read it I was hooked. There is excitement throughout the story, especially at the end. The Watchers will be a great epic series, and I would not be surprised to see it at the movies soon. If you are a teen you will love the characters of Ian, Marco, and Camille. I predict the relationship between Ian and Camille will become a serious one. If you are an adult you will love the Watchers, and the growing battles between the good Watchers and the evil Watchers. If you thought certain countries in Europe were becoming a problem now, wait till you see them thirty years from now according to J. J. Falcon. His view of the world in 2030 is so realistic. I hope the second book won't take long to come out."
5,simply amazing!!,"just finished reading it a second time and it was an awsome story. its original, and exciting. the characters are funny and believable. the diologue made the book. it does not draw out in boring telling. instead, it is done in diologue and that is why I read it a second time. if this does not become a movie I will be shocked!! I would love to talk more about the book, but is better that you check it out for yourselves."
5,Good blower AND Hydroponics fixed a shipping error,"The Dayton blower is running right now. It's ruggedly built and very quiet. I'm using it to move the heat from a basement coal stove through our air ducts. We have had a problem with natural circulation and believe that this fan will solve this problem; early indications are good. The fan uses about $0.35/day (~2.4 kWh/day).Regarding Hydroponics: Though I received the wrong blower (EcoPlus) at first, they promptly sent out the Dayton blower that I had ordered once I contacted them with the error. They also paid the freight on the return trip for the EcoPlus which was a real plus."
1,Your money can be put to better use,"It's a regurgitation of what you are taught in your pre licensure class. Read you text before class and take hand written notes from comments made from your instructor. You do fine. If the licensing school is trying to sell you this book, it is only an up sale nothing more."
4,"Helpful, says everyone","Everyone I talk to tells me this is a great book to have for the sample tests. The readability of it is zero---make sure you have a supplement with words and phrases and background before you crack this open. It summarizes key points and thats IT. Then gives you sample quizes. And vocab. The thing everyone says is great is that it gives you the answers to the test and tells you the answer---and why the answer is right to the question they ask. Its helpful as an alternative source---if you are new to real estate, PLEASE don't just use this book. The vocabulary alone will KILL YOU! Use this as a study guide and practice material to your main work. And good luck!"
4,A Must Have,Guide to passing the PSI real estate exam is a must have for anyone who wishes to become a real estate agent. All topics discussed are simple to understand including the math.
5,Guide to Passing the PSI Exam,"Start at the beginning, answer each chapter as you go along, go back and do it again - you will pass the exam. It's great!"
3,Not a strong release,"I love Sebadoh. Lou Barlows lyrics have remained consitently beautiful throughout the years, especially on III, the Freed Weed, and Bubble and Scrape. But this album is just not up to par...it just isnt satisfying. There are some good moments, On Fire and Ocean are great, but overall this is their worst album yet. The production was a little thin, Lou Barlows songs were good but not great, and I have never been a big fan of Jason Lowensteins songs. And Bob Fays drumming is not the least bit adventurous, he can keep a steady beat, but he is definently limited. I miss Eric Gaffney and the lo fi days of III, he added such a great, chaotic feeling to the band that has been absent on Bakesale and espescially on Harmacy. Quite dissapointing."
4,If barlow didn't have pretentious bandmates,"I thoroughly enjoy this album, save one thing; Lou Barlow is a tremendous talent, and frankly, his bandmates are not. So, buy this album and you will get one part well crafted songs and another part immature no-talents banging on their instruments like drunken 13-year olds who just got an F in gym.But, Barlow's ""art"" tips the balance and makes it worthy of more than a few listens."
5,Absolutely Incredible,"When I first heard Harmacy, the opening track shocked me with its incredible beauty. Lou Barlow has written many beautiful songs, but ""On Fire"" tops them all. And the tracks which follow are the same kind of mix of power and beauty which I thought Sebadoh had perfected on Bakesale. But they surpass Bakesale on this one. Buy this album--if you like beautiful and powerful rock, you will not be disappointed. I also have to mention that one critic said they listened to this album over and over again and ""didn't get it."" If you believe as I do that there isn't anything profound or important to ""get"" about an album, and the experience of incredible music you want to listen to over and over again is all you want, buy this album."
4,heavenly! still sailing,"The former champions of twee are back under a different name, ""Marine Research"" with all the cuteness and sweetness that Amelia and crew can muster.. even in light of her brother's, (former heavenly drummer) Matthew's death. 10 great new songs are on ""Sounds From the Gulfstream"" in the same vein as past Heavenly and Talullah Gosh albums. Some of the songs are uptempo, bright and spry and include sparkly jems like, Venn Diagram, Parellel Horizontal,and At the Lost and Found. Despite all the smiles there is an underlying current of sadness in the lyrics and songs, that sort of hints at recent setbacks and tragedies that these folks have been through. Despite the hint of sadness the musicianship is still great and I found myself listening to the album in it's entirety over and over again. it is definitely a must have for any heavenly or twee pop fan out their.- k."
4,Good product,Great net! Sturdy ! Just make sure that you get the size of the location first to make sure it's not too short :)
3,An ok movie,I saw the Japanese version and i was very disappointed with the movie! I am a Hard Core gundam fan and if the acting was better and there where some dvd extras the movie would have been great!
3,Decent Enough To Enjoy!,"I think that although i wouldmn't rate the movie great, but it is better than what i've read and personnally expected. granted the Gundam scene is not alot, but the CG is awesome. A non gundam fan wouldn't rate this movie good, but a gundam fan should be able to enjoy it. Plot and Acting are decently made, although could be better. Overall, 3 Stars out of 5 is the best I can give."
3,Gundam? It nearly killed 'em...,"A Gundam fans dream come true. A live-action/cg Gundam movie. An ex-military deep-sea researcher becomes involved in a conspiracy when radicals from the Gaia colony infiltrate his research facility. Set 130 years after Char's Counter Attack the federation is replaced by the Congress of Settlement Nations (CONSENT). The space battles are nice but the characters are unbelievable and the first half of the movie is slow. The script has many one-line moments that would work given the proper performance, but fall flat here. If you are a Gundam fan, go watch this now. Others should just get 0083. 3 stars."
2,ugh,"This movie is a live action gundam. Now, gundam is my favorite anime series and i think, that for the most part they are done quite well. This movie should only be rented (hopefully you didnt buy it on a whim like i did) if you want to see EXTREMLY short ok cgi sequences surrounded by the worst acting youve ever seenPros- Its giant robots!OK CGICons- short and few mobile suit battlesHorrible actinglame cast"
1,The Worst Gundam Series I Seen,I really hate this movie because of the Stupid Surround Sound.I could barely hear the actors speaking. There should have been more fighting and less talking. Even I can think of making a better Gundam Movie based on the Gundam Series. This movie is a waste of money and I think everyone should not buy it.
2,Too little too late,"Lets get right to it:The Good:1) Nice mecha designs and the CG looked good.2) Good (but too brief) battle scene towards the end.The Bad:1) Wooden characters. Ironic that the the first 3D version of Gundam would have such 1D characters. Besides the Mecha, Gundam has always had great characters and this movie had none.2) Slow pacing. It takes way to long to get to the big Mecha battle at the end and then its over much too quickly.The Ugly:1) This should have been a Japanese production. In Western hands it just came out unimaginative and boring. It happened with Godzilla (which luckily is back in Japanese hands) and its happened here with Gundam."
1,Please read before buying this!,"I am a die hard Gundam fan. Everything from the 0079 series to Turn A and even Wing. Gundam has a very big cult following and for us fans it is an animated world full of action, drama, mystery and suspense. It is sad to see how G-Saviour bastardized the Gundam universe. The only thing worth watching is the 5 minutes of CG which isn't really all that great. The plot is REALLY bad, the acting is horrible, the characters are VERY plain and one dimensional. If you are a Gundam fan please don't purchase this lame excuse for a movie...if you do they'll only start making more garbage like this. Unfortunately this was an impulse buy and I am stuck with it (the people I have offered to give it away to don't want it). Spend your money elsewhere...perhaps start exploring other Anime/Mecha titles such as Getter Robo or Big O. If not go ahead and burn your money...it's probably more enjoyable to watch than this movie."
4,Better than you'd think.,"I know what you're thinking. ""Lovely, a live action version of anime. Could it get any worse?"" Yes, it could. However, in my opinion, it wasn't as bad as it could've been. This movie was done fairly well, and the acting was decent. No big names, but I wasn't expecting any. The best part, of course, is the big battle between the colony Gaia and the Earth forces. All suits are done exceptionally well in CGI, and even show off some suits I don't think are in any of the anime.Save for the colonies (Sides) and the design of the mobile suits (the word ""Gundam"" is never said in the course of the movie), the story, while good, has nothing to do with either the Mobile Suit Gundam series or the Gundam Wing series. It's completely out on its own. Definitly worth the time it takes to watch it. Though, I would've only given it 3.5 stars, but there's no halves here."
3,decent,"unfortunately G-Saviour is only a decent movie. The acting involved is somewhat mediocre, but one thing the movie has going for it is the awesome CG. The CG itself merits a 5 star rating (unfortunately there isn't enough fighting in the gundams), but the acting and storyline are lacking tremendously, which is why i rate this movie 3 stars. i do recommend this movie to any gundam fan, but if you aren't a gundam fan, please don't start with this one, try another gundam title first."
1,My eyes are burning,"Oh god was this bad. It was so bad that while watching it all I could think of doing was hunt down and kill whoever made this piece of crap. Let's see what else the plot for starters. Wow if this wasn't the stupidest thing in the world I don't know what is. Heck monkeys with typewriters could come up with a better plot than this. Acting: horrible. My six year old sister could act better than these clowns. All 30 seconds of CG was kind of cool, maybe if you where on acid. Whatever you do don't buy this, don't borrow this from a friend. And if you do buy this then I'm sorry my friend but God hates you and you are a born loser."
5,gundam at it's best live action,Gundam is one of the best anime in the world it's by far much better then the dragon ball series.This movie is the best gundam movie for many reasons. one it is a stand alone movie (that means it is not A saga of movies one example is star wars)the other is that the story is easy to follow (to me it is)but you must pay attention to the movie when you watch it. I would recommand this movie more for the star wars fans then the gundam fans or the babylon 5 fans.
5,Morris and Boris will make kids and adults laugh,"It is a shame that so many Morris and Boris books are out of print. A person of any age who doesn't laugh when these are read should be checked to see if he or she is still breathing. As a struggling almost reader, my daughter was motivated to figure out the words to find out just what Boris and Morris are going to do next."
5,One of my very favorite little books,"This book simply presents a collection of thoughts of how folks define God. From the very young to the very old; the vary famous to the ""man on the street""; from the very religious to the committedly atheistic. An wonderful liitle book for those of us who believe in spiritual pluralism."
1,Don't throw away your SP! Remove residue by...,"using plain alcohol on a q-tip. It will take a few (or even several) attempts but the nasty goo will dissolve and your SP will be fine. I bought these awful, awful screen covers for my son's SP and it is as good as new after a little alcohol. Don't pour the alcohol on...use the q-tip.Hope this helps someone."
4,it's not so BAD,"this screen protectors aren't so bad , but why after putting it on your screen , you would want to take it off?? i mean that's insane , tha only bad thing about this it collects a bit of dust on your screen , and you can't really see what you're playing in day , but at night it's good ,i have had mine for almost a year now and it hasn't come off,but people don't throw away your sp , rub it with alcahol , and the goo will come off."
4,"Fourteen soft, acoustic based songs.","Another ex-Erics Tripper, Julie Doiron (a.k.a. Broken Girl) is back with her sophmore release, Lonliest in the Morning. Fouteen soft, acoustic based songs about life, love and motherhood. Reminiscent of the softer side of Erics Trip, background music for reading or a nice drive on a fall night. Julie shines most on ""So fast"" and ""Condescending you."" ET fans will not be disapointed, nor will new fans."
2,"Don't own this yet, but...","How can you reviewers discount the song that brought me to search for this album??? I'm talking of Motion City Soundtrack's 'The Worse Part.' AHFi's track may be great but this one, is amazing. In a small way it showcases the greatness of MCS."
5,I give 5 stars because,"""Save Me"" is an awesome song. In fact, its my favorite on this CD. Maxeen is a great band whom I think have immense talent. You should definitely check out there CD! It's awesome. [...] I think the people who decided to put Maxeen on the Sounds of Superman are very smart. They are a powerfully talented band like Superman!"
2,disappointing,Disappointing in both technical and artistic sound. Will probably give the cd away to get it out of my collection.
1,"Not a great CD at all, but...","the one song that is worth the listen is from American Hi-Fi titled ""The Rescue."" It's a great song surrounded by a myriad of terrible ones. However, i have to disagree with the poster who called for a boycott of the new movie. Would you rather Ottoman and Singer completely copy Williams' original score? Would any of the compositions work, aside from the ""Superman March?"" No, they wouldn't. This is a totally new film and, in turn, it deserves a totally new score. No one should boycott the upcoming film. See it before crassly dismissing it as worthless."
2,Good for learning technique but too much language,"This video is OK to watch once or twice to get the technique down. John's descriptions and directions are very good. However, I found this video to have way too much language. I found John's non stop talking to be distracting and not conducive to relaxing and going within, as it should be in yoga. This video is a training video only. It's not one I could practice yoga with on a regular basis."
2,disappointed,"I read this book expecting a combination literary analysis and ""how to date"" book, explaining the virtues and flaws of the characters in ""Pride and Prejudice"" and how they relate to our times. It was that, in part, but I found myself increasingly annoyed at her giggle-with-me style of writing, and downright furious by her assumption that anyone who admires or resembles Lizzie or Darcy is, of course, a good Christian. Some of us consider ourselves to be kind and decent people and aren't Christian at all. In the end,I found it beyond disappointing; I found it insulting."
5,Excellent Book for Young women!!,"First off, it's a universal truth that Mr. Darcy is the perfect man. This book shows us why, what kind of characteristics make a guy worth dating, and how to listen to those little red flags that make Wickham look so good. This is a very fun read, even if you are married! But I will be keeping it for my daughter to study as she gets older.Sarah has taken all the elements of Pride and Prejudice that we love, and put them in a heartfelt, wonderfully practical book."
5,Smart Girls Will Like This Book,"It is universally known that a single young woman is secretly in want of a Mr. Darcy. Sarah Arthur is no exception; she herself confesses to having a crush on Jane Austen's tall, dark and handsome hero from ""Pride and Prejudice."" She devotes an entire book to highlighting Mr. Darcy's best qualities, comparing him with Mr. Wickham, Mr. Collins and with most of the single men out there in the world today. Directed toward teenage, female audiences, this book encourages girls not to settle for the Wickham's of the world but to set their sights higher and wait for their own Mr. Darcy. This book is chalk full of ""Pride and Prejudice"" trivia, tidbits on Jane Austen's own life and even has a few prayers that Austen composed as devotionals for her own family.""Dating Mr. Darcy"" is a perfect read for any young woman searching for her own Mr. Right/Mr. Darcy.http://veronicaleigh.blogspot.com"
4,"Witty,Fast and Fun.","I am not in need of dating advice, but this book seemed fun read. And it was. And I do have to say that for any woman who likes reading, and maybe even if you don't Mr. Darcy is one of the world's perfect men. Oh sure his initial aloofness leaves a lot to be desired, but over all he is a great choice of man. Sarah Arthur does a fine job of interlacing literature, humor, wit and useful tips into her book.Weather you're a single girl or not you can use this book as something to look at. It really does offer some practical advice to dating and just relationships in general. And if you're a Jane Austen fan there is no doubt that you will enjoy the references to it. Dating Mr. Darcy was a fun and fast read that if you have just a couple of hours you can knock it off and have fun while doing it."
3,good questions,It has good questions for anyone to ask in a relationship. I found the religious aspect to be a bit much. Several parts were repetitive which I found annoying.
1,Highly Disappointed,"I bought this HDCD based on the fact that it is an HDCD, I like Dowland, and original instrument recordings. The first cut is fantastic. However, each to their own, the next two vocal cuts are not to my tastes. The engineering seems to be heavily ""tweaked"" to cover for quality of the vocalist and this severely hurts the sound of the excellent instrumentalists who would have been better off without the vocalist, IMHO. I couldn't bear the thought of listening to any more of the album.Too bad, because it had excellent promise."
5,A BLUES COMPANION,"Starts with Bobby Blue Bland , features Denise Lasalle and Shirley Brown, Latimore and gives us a look at Ernie Johnson. Oh there is more. A worthy purchase."
2,Too heavy at beginning to be useful,"After a useful chapter 1 ""Quickstart"", the text plunges quickly into mind-boggling complexity, including lengthy initial ""Security basics"", philosophic ""Overview of JEE application development"", ""Web application principles"", ""Web application design"", and a do-it-my-way ""Setting up a development environment"" chapters. Do we have to have Ant and MySQL installation at the start? Finally, chapters 9 and 10 are helpful for those who either persevered or skipped ahead.Publishers should require better writing skills from their authors and ""cut-the-crap""."
4,These brothers sound like me!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I related to the struggles of several of the characters, especially Terence. You can bet I'll be recommending it to my frat brothers, because I know they'll 'feel' it, but I'm recommending it to my wife too. Not All Dogs presents issues I struggled with in college, in a way that will help her understand the man I used to be and the man I've grown into. C. Kelly has done a lovely job with this story: finally, something that shows the diversity of Black men as well as the nature of the struggles we go through."
2,Maybe the next one...,"Sorry, but I didn't relate to any of the characters in this book, they were too preachy and unreal, wearing their religious faith a badge. I couldn't finish the book, but I will look forward to Chet Robinson's next projects. The editing was a bit lacking, but much props to the author for self publishing the book."
5,Loved it!,"I absolutely loved Not All Dogs! As a single mom who believes in the good brothers out there, I had to share this book with some of my girl and guy friends. They liked it, but I didn't let them finish because I was so into it! I felt like I knew these guys as well as the women in their lives, and I kept turning the pages to see what would happen with the Center. C. Kelly is very talented, but he writes with integrity, too: he's not just writing for our entertainment, he's making us think at the same time. Buy this book, you will not be disappointed!"
2,Good Story - Poor Writing!,"There is much to be said for self-published authors, and I have a great deal of respect for them. However, in spite of the difficulties and obstacles, I still expect good editing, grammer, solid plots and character building. Although the base story line is a good one, Not All Dogs is lacking in many areas. In fact, Robinson filled the pges with several meaningless scenes, which weighed the plot down unnecessarily. Trite words and phrases (cherub), poor transitions (what's with the astericks)...???"
1,So So Boring.....,This had to be the WORST book I have ever read!!! The whole story was slow. I had to finish it because whenever I start a book whether I like it or not I do finish it. I am usually done a book within 2 days this book took me two weeks. Do not waster your money on this book!!!
3,ok,"This story was about four college guy's who was tryin to deal with school and the other problems going on in their life. Terence didn't know how he was gonna pay for school, Brandon was a chrisitan guy trying to find the right girl. OJ was a playboy preacher, and Larry comes from money, but end up fallin for a girl totaly different from his type. The book was kind of boring for me with all the scenes about Orange was doing to get the center closed down. I liked the part when Bobby and Brandon were trying to explain to Monica and Tera about gospel artists who sometime seem to lean toward the secular side. I wish i could find someone like Brandon and Bobby. The story was good i just hate reading about any form of decit."
4,Interesting Book,"Larry, Terence, O.J. and Brandon are friends who attend the same university. While trying to keep their upbringing in check, each struggle with their own issues.Larry was raised to date girls with certain credentials. Terrance, struggling with betraying his friends to save his brother's life. Brandon struggling with betraying his religion by not becoming intimate with girls. O.J. struggling with being a minister or a player.Each of the young men are struggling because they are trying to live up to their upbringings. They have a common goal to protect a community center, which is undergoing some underhanded mismanagement.Several messages are presented throughout the book. This is a great book to read for adults and young adults alike."
3,"Well Done, With One Exception","I have one complaint, Mr. Robinson: don't focus so heavily on color. I felt like a little too much time was spent describing every character's complexion. Is it really that important? Aside from that, though, this book was well written and I did enjoy it. You don't read about young men like this very often, uniting to uplift their community while dealing with their own issues. Keep writing, C. Kelly - you kept me reading AND told a good story."
5,This soundtrack is absolutely the best!!,"I decided to purchase the ""Felicity"" tv soundtrack, because I love the show. After listening to the CD a few times,I must admit that I love this CD. Every song on the CD, takes you back to a memorable scene. I particularly love the songs by Heather Nova, Ivy, Sarah Mclachlan, Amy Jo Johnson, and Kate Bush. I recommend anyone who is a big fan of the show to buy this CD."
2,Just Don't Dig It,"Well except for Amy Jo Johnson and Heather Nova, I feel that this album fell short of expectations...Unless you like music that will put you in a somber and calm mood and you did not like the Dawson's Creek album, I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Excellent!,"I must say the show is excellent, the CD is excellent, everything is excellent! My fave show used to be Dawson's Creek, but now Felicity is my all time never miss show! I think the setting is way more real and the acting is better. A definite good choice!"
2,Very Disappointing,"One word to describe this soundtrack...disappointing! Despite a few gems, the rest of the music is hardly noteworthy. I guess it was still worth buying since the songs by Heather Nova and Amy Jo Johnson are great...but I can't say the same for the rest of the CD. The only way I would enjoy the entire CD is if I was in an extremely calm and somber mood...so if you like that kind of music, you'll really enjoy it...I guess it's all depends on your taste! Enjoy it or don't...love always!"
4,"Missing A Key Song...Madonna's ""Power of Goodbye""","This is a decent soundtrack, but I couldn't help missing the song ""Power of Goodbye"" by Madonna. I think that since Madonna's track was originally the theme song it should have at least been included on the soundtrack. No other song on the cd captures what the show is really about...saying goodbye to your childhood and going into bigger and better things."
2,Very disappointed,"I consider myself an avid fan of this show, as I have watched the reruns over and over again, as well as purchased most of the series on DVD. One of my favorite pieces of Felicity was the selection of music that was played during the episodes. When I saw that there was a compilation of songs from the shows, I was looking forward to hearing them. However, many of the songs from the shows were not included on the CD, and I was disappointed with so many of the songs that were on the CD. I will always love that show, regardless of the disppointing CD - there's nothing like it around anymore - I am grateful that I experienced such a wonderful program."
5,Felicity Rocks!,"I consider myself a huge Felicity fan and if the CD is anything as good as the show itself, then it will be awesome! They find the greatest music to enhance the drama of the show! I can't wait to get it!"
3,"Not what I hoped for, the Felicity soundtrack","is a little too angsty and slow-moving for me. I like the first four songs, especially Sarah McLachlan's 'Good Enough' and Heather Nova's 'Heart and Shoulder,' but the middle of the CD gets mired down. I'd like to have seen more songs along the lines of Aretha Franklin's cover of 'Bridge Over Troubled Water'. It's nice to have the Felicity theme song and a song by Amy Jo Johnson, but with the new theme song this season I hope they release a second CD with some more upbeat tunes."
3,Well. . .,"first of all i am a huge felicity fan and i was so pumped to hear that they had a cd come out, cuz there is some great music on that show. i was a little disapointed with the cd. there was so much better stuff they could have put on it. but yet the the cd was ok so i gave it 3 stars. beforei go i have got to say that i think the best song on the whole cd is puddle of grace by amy jo johnson--she is an awesome singer"
5,Great Soundtrack,"This CD captures the mood of the show perfectly. Most impressive is Amy Jo's Puddle of Grace - which is, I feel, the best track on the album. I heard she's in a band. I forgot the name. But I can't wait for her own album.And it will be about time if radio stations finally start playing Heather Nova, dag-nab-it!"
2,ok...,"I only bought the cd for puddle of grace by amy jo johnson, and I knew there was going to have some boring songs on it...I was right. But I'm still glad because this particular song is excellent."
3,Repetitive,"14 tracks that more or less all sound the same. Not a lot of diversity here. Woman's Work by Kate Bush is, of course, moving. Aretha - can't go wrong with Aretha. And the track by Amy Jo ""Julie"" Johnson is good, but there just isn't much else going on here that is all that interesting. Recommend the soundtracks from Dawson's Creek and Teaching Mrs. Tingle over this one."
4,Question about a song heard on the July 27th episode,"I would be very grateful to someone who could tell me the name and/or artist of the song playing toward the end of the (July 27th repeat episode)show while Julie's Birthday Party was going on. Never heard it before, but loved it. Please help! Thank you, Shannon"
4,I am in love with this CD,I really like this Cd and I listen to it all the time I just have one comment. I think they shoukd have put more songs that I have heard of on the CD. I don't even remember hearing these songs. They are pretty good though. I also want to say if you are looking for pictures of the cast you are going to be disapointed. There is like 2 pictures and only one has the full cast. They are basically of her and Scott foley.
3,Not Quite,"Quality seems OK, but overall vest is just a bit too short for my liking. It also seems to fit quite loose. I ordered the ""Large size' which is what I normally wear and it turned out a bit loose and a tad short. I am 5""9"" and weigh 200 Lbs."
2,vest fit,"I did not care for the way the vest fit, it did not look like a biker's vest. Gave it to my father-in-law he has worn it on cruises."
2,Only a 2 because I didn't receive the correct vest.,I ordered a plain black vest and received one with patches all over it....otherwise it was a well made vest and I would have proudly worn it...had I received the one that I requested. The company was however prompt in accepting my return and in processing my refund.
5,Excellent,"Great read, a lot of information in here that makes a lot of sense. Put my mind at ease about a lot of things. HIGHLY recommend!!"
4,good book,"This is a great book. I have come to learn that most body or facial tics come from a lack of electrolytes (often mostly Magnesium) in children and adults. The industry doesn't focus on this aspect of health because there is not much money in it. I have come to learn (not from this book) that tics are grown out of, because adults grow out of them because their taste in food gravitates toward greens, which are rich in Magnesium. I still enjoyed the book."
5,Tics and Tourette's: Breakthrough Discoveries in Natural treatments,"The book was very informative. After we followed some of the advices in the book, our child had been improving greatly."
5,Excellent Overview of Tic Disorders and Natural Alternative Treatment Options,"This was an informative book. There certainly is hope for those suffering from these disorders that doesn't necessarily have to involve dangerous drugs. I am a candidate for a doctorate as a Naturopath and will use this in my resource library. The question to always ask is what is my body/mind trying to tell me with regard to my symptoms. This book will guide you to look at the symptoms and ask those questions. It will also help you begin your journey by suggesting various avenues to explore. It leaves the reader with a sense of hope for successfully treating the root causes naturally. Treatment can be multi-faceted, often like putting together a puzzle. The end result makes it worth all the time and energy spent. Hope is something soarly lacking in most medical resources for these disorders, that makes this book all the more valuable."
1,THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE!,"We use this book at school, and it is absolutely horrbile. This is not for people who have any Spanish experience, its meant for people who cant speak it at all. AND ITS STILL HORRIBLE! The book is disorganized with retarted stories that make no sense. And the exersizes have no point to them."
5,An Excellent Film of Cormac McCarthy's Novel,"Cormac McCarthy, one of the best 20th Century American writers, wrote All The Pretty Horses in 1992, the first novel of his Border Trilogy. I read the novel about 10 years ago and saw this film soon after its release in 2000.I watched All The Pretty Horses again today and have to disagree with the Amazon editorial comments on this film. Their review says that the film is too short (just short of 2 hours) and hard to follow because of the cuts. I disagree. I would love to see a 4 hour remake of the film, but I'm afraid that won't happen. Billy Bob Thornton is not one of our great directors, but I think he did a good job on this one. The actors are excellent and the use of both Spanish with subtitles and English is effective. The DVD looks good.If you liked this movie I recommend another film based on a Cormac McCarthy novel: No Country for Old Men, A Coen Brothers film with Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, and Josh Brolin."
5,Absorbing Read and Series,"This was my first Faye Kellerman novel involving Dectective Peter Decker and Rina Lazarus. I thoroughly enjoyed it, read the sequel, and then the first novel in the Peter Decker/ Rina Lazarus series, Ritual Bath, piqued by how these two characters met, and how their relationship evolves.The best novels in this series employ gripping, page turning mysteries, the human aspect of the evolving relationship between Peter and Rina, and explanations of Judaism in somewhat the same way as Harry Kemelman's Rabbi David Small mysteries, or the older G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown mysteries, the latter combining great mysteries with interesting explications of Catholicism.Warning: You might get hooked to the series!"
4,One of Faye Kellerman's best books.,"Having read three other Faye Kellerman novels, this one was by far the best. I found it difficult to put the book down, and was fascinated by all of the characters, twists and turns. I very much enjoyed the expanded ""role"" Rina had in this book and would hope to see more of the Decker's relationship in future books."
1,boring,"The religious lessons, theology, rites and ritual one is forced to endure while reading Faye Kellerman's books completely destroys any enjoyment of the mystery--threw it in the garbage after 100 pages. There's too many other interesting writers out there!!"
1,Excellent unless you're a Christian,"Like ""Grievous Sin"" this book is another exercise in spreading contempt for religious Christians. Faye Kellerman's writing, and stories are excellent. If you're a Christian grab some other Peter Decker, Rina Lazarus book and enjoy it -- they are all well written and fun to read. But avoid this one and ""Grievous Sin"" unless you have a thick skin. In her other books religious Christians have the luxury of being igored."
3,I kept thinking it would get better.,"This book is 406 pages long--4 pages of action, 200 pages of pointless speculation by police investigators, 200 pages of rambling family relationship problems, and 2 pages describing Decker's headaches and what he did or didn't eat. I did enjoy the dynamics between Rina Lazarus and Bram, the Catholic priest."
2,Not the best,Not the best Faye Kellerman has written. Too dragged down with her Rina and her 'Yenta' stuff. Get over it.
4,A Religious Heart Surgeon is Murdered,"This mystery in the Rina Decker series is a very readablepage-turner. Faye Kellerman'sstrength is her characteri-zation. Many of the characters in this novel, as well asher other books, seem quite real.This novel deals with the murder of a religious heart surgeon,his very dysfunctional family and Rina Decker's past relation-ship with the surgeon's son, now a priest."
3,A little missing on the nuances,"As someone who grew up in an orthodox Christian home (read fundamentalist) I was amused by the heavy handedness of this novel. For someone who is so superb at writing the nuances and sophistication of orthodox Judiasm, I was surprised to see how little she understood orthodox Christianity -- or if she did not claim to understand it, why she would write about it. So many things were off -- the names, the language, the prayers, the culture. I didn't find it insulting as much as I realized she simply didn't know."
1,If you have a brain don't by this book!,I'm only writing this review so the average rating is'nt 4 stars! THAT IS INSANE!
4,perko light,"Shipping was quick. Had no problems with the packaging. The light itself was........a light, what can I say. It's the short type and the price was right. Being short, it helps with the never ending problem of being something to quickly grab if you were off balance. That was the reason for the low profile for me."
5,A candid struggle of one woman&#65533;s anguished mental affliction,"Robert H. Gerner, M.D, Assoc. Research Psychiatrist- UCLA:This is a candid struggle of one woman's anguished mental affliction and resolution experienced through the lens of her earlier gift of music. Patients, families and professional alike can readily feel her inner struggle with distorted perceptions of the world around her, and share in the reconstruction of her identity as an individual."
4,One of drone rock's strongest releases,"This album, quite simply, is engrossing, intelligent, and awesome. From the thundering riffs to the delicate organ and piano, this album proves to be a tour de force for Earth. While many in drone rock seem content to play dark/death drone, Earth are off spiraling through the cosmos and nebulas of desert rock and soundtracks. This is definitely a great album for chilling or rocking out. Also, it has the coolest name of any album ever. Just sayin'."
3,Interesting ideas for alternative furniture.,"This book has so me good ideas for DIY flat-pack furniture, but it is probably best if you are fairly skilled with tools and basic construction principles if you plan to do any of the projects. The font the book is written in is hard on the eyes."
4,Great more for thinking than actual projects,"Wow. I remember this book as a kid more than 40 years ago. Some very good concepts in here, but the book is somewhat dated(remember water beds?).There are a few storage/seating ideas that hold up well over time, but the main concept is that one way to stay nomadic is to have less stuff or own items that are readily made, recycled or very portable. It's very much written from a designer's view point. Some ideas are a little too clunky, like using milk jugs for light covers and spheres out of Styrofoam cups. They even have a kid car seat made out of cardboard before they were available at all for the US market.I spent many many hours with the book and helped a lot with furnishing my dorm room back in the day.Maybe nice to pick up used for under $20, but needs some serious updating to justify the cover price."
1,"ALERT! These have changed! Smaller bags, now you get less!","The label on the little bag says 1 serving is 120 calories. But one serving is 1 ounce. The little single serving sized bag is 1.5 ounces! So there are 180 calories in the bag. This is sneaky. No one is going to open their bag and measure out one ounce, then save the other half ounce...EDITED TO ADD:I ordered these again because the price went down momentarily (is now back up) and the product is now changed. Although Amazon still had it listed at 12, 1.5 ounce bags, what I got is 12, 1.2 oz bags. So now yes, one bag is a serving but the nutrition facts do not add up to what was listed before. Now a bag has 120 calories and 15g carbs. Another sneaky move, you get less for the same price."
4,"Love the Cinnamon Toast flavor, not the others","I really like the flavor and crunchiness of the Cinnamon Toast pretzel sticks. And 10g of protein in a tasty convenient, wheat and dairy-free snack is great. I wasn't so impressed with the butter flavor. I think most of the reviewers that didn't care for the sticks were referring to the butter flavor.In response to another reviewer, yes, the package states that this product is made on the same production line as products containing soybeans, dairy, tree nuts, and wheat. That does not mean it is not gluten-free. It may or may not be an issue for you depending on just how sensitive you are."
2,Earthy...,"The freshness is great during the initial crunch but once the chewing and swallowing takes place, these pretzels are very earthy and grainey tasting...I have several bags you can have for free."
4,Good Snack When Dieting,"These pretzels have a good cinnamon taste and are really crunchy. They are a satisfying ""good for you"" snack as you can nibble on them for quite a while. Also have no trans fats or artificial flavors. Will purchase again!"
2,blech,"These aren't clearly labeled ""GLUTEN FREE"". They say pretzel sticks and they do not resemble pretzel sticks very closely at all. They are a weird flavor, sort of costly and not worth it. eew."
2,Not worth the money,"You get 12 bags for 12.00, in each bag is about a handleful of pretzels. The taste is ok but not worth a dollar a bag.."
2,Nutritious but not so delicious.,"These pretzels have a nice crunch and a lot of nutritional value, but their flavor is very bland. Bland with a hint of cinnamon. I wish I'd tried a single bag before buying an entire 12-bag box, but they're not available in stores (at least where I live) and the reviews seemed fairly positive. On the bright side, they do leave you feeling comfortably full for minimal calories. A recommended diet food for those who have the fortitude to place higher priority on protein-dense snacking rather than flavor."
4,Great mezzo and trumpet,"This is one of the better Messiahs, although not quite up to Westenberg's level.Its world-beater aspects include mezzo Anne-Sophie von Otter, whose ""He was despised"" is well north of magnificent: Warmly mournful in the slow sections, snarling and spitting in the center section.Trumpeter Mark Bennett does by far the best trumpeting on any of my 30 complete Messiahs. ""Glory to God"" and ""Hallelujah"" are as good as it gets -- no, better than any other recording gets.Countertenor Michael Chance is quite good in ""If God be for us"" -- I say that as someone who doesn't like countertenors.Some of the other choruses are also well done. But tenor Jerry Hadley seems to have thought he had more lucrative things to do with his time than to think about Messiah."
4,Great book for educators and others in helping professions,"Diane Frey and C. Jesse Carlock really seem to understand low self-esteem and the realistic steps to improving self-esteem. Thier 4 phase approach provides a low-risk, high-support environment to learn and grow. Activities are age-group and group size rated for maximum benefit. Some activities seem lost in context and a little odd. It is best used with accompanying workbook and affirmation guide, also by these authors."
3,Not a nice book,"Finally arrived, but the content is not appealing. In-depth thinking is not great, too much Q&A problem solving."
2,The wire is Yellow rather than green as in Amazon's photo,"What can you say about 20 A.W.G. wire? I believed I was purchasing green wire as the photo Amazon uses shows. I wanted green as I'm using it for ground wires that will be visible for my particular application, so I am dismayed that I received YELLOW wire. Other than it being the wrong colored wire, I guess it is fine. I uploaded an image of the actual wire to hopefully prevent others from having the same experience, if the color matters for your application. If the color representation were accurate, this may rate 5 stars."
5,A great soul's adventure at the end of the Roman Empire,"As a Roman History major, I was astonished at Kathleen's accuracy of the period. As a human being, my heart soared on the life's experience of this noble character. I forced my wife to read it, she now shares this book with all of her friends. A great read"
4,Great CD!! Worth the price!!,"This CD is a very good listen and even better when this band plays thess songs live!! Because when Velocity sings her lyrics, they are very heartfelt and emotionally charged. This band will take off with the current band line-up. Because the live performances should not be missed for the materila on this CD and any of their previous and later material after this CD. I gave this four stars because the band line-up has changed with Velocity being the only constant member left."
4,"A good read, but know your history!","I am about halfway through this book. It is a pretty good book; it has an intriguing subject. But it is a bit confusing, and Mr. Goodwin has a tendency to go offtrack. Also, be prepared to know your history, because a lot of the people mentioned do not have introductions and/or biographies. Overall, this book is pretty good."
4,Brief History of U.S. Through $$$$$,"Mr. Goodwin wrote a good tale of money, though he tendsto side track and lose the thought of the heading of thebook. (Hence only 4 stars.) The book reads easily enough,with plenty of fact and trivia information. People whoread this book will find themselves saying ""Is that so, orAh, that's why."" (Wants to know why we call South Dixie?It's in the book.)Some people might be/get confused when he talkes aboutgold standards vs. silver standards, I sometimes wonderif Economics 102 is needed for certain portion of the book.But, overall, a good read, definitely interesting for asociety that revolves around money."
2,System requirements are too vague,We never got to install this product. The ssytem requirements on the box say that it needs a sound card. It would not work on our system so we called tech support. They said that you need an analogue sound card and we had a digital. Had they been more specific on the package we would have exchanged it (it was a gift). Now it is open and we are stuck with a useless program.
5,Amazing,Believe me. I do realy like this home theater system. This is one of the best purchases i have ever made and the best part is i did not have to pay thousands of dollars to get a VERY HIGH QUALITY HOME THEATER SYSTEM. Now i understand why ONKYO is written in CAPITAL LETTERS. Thank you. Luis.
2,Does not work!,"After 2 months the receiver and woofer is dead. Not even the front light comes on. Hope they have some warranty or service center.The surround sound effect is not as good as even my $250 Samsung HT I bought4 yrs ago.About 7.1 Surround > If you want to use HDMI cable, you must have a TV with HDMI! Meaning, DVD player, Receiver & TV all must have HDMI. So say good bye to your 3 yr old HDTVsAll in all way below expectations."
3,good have been worse,When I had the installers pull it out of the box it had a bad Sub woofer. So I had to pay for professional install even thou I didn't hal a fully functioning system. Then the replacement system almost went to the wrong place. I had to leave work to get it. (Did I mention the first system arrived three days late) It now sound good but it takes a big turn on the volume know here anything. Good Luck
3,"great sound quality, but DVD player issues and HDMI video pass through","Great sound system. the receiver was working great, but stopped transferring video along the same time the dvd player started to malfunction and ""could not read"" the dvd. I replaced with one of my other dvd players and it worked again...then the hdmi video pass through pretty much failed slowly...with a stuttering effect.So now I've rerouted all my audio through optical directly to my tv and seems to work great, but this isn't the way it's intended at its full potential. awesome speakers and very good fidelity, it seems the receiver power is ample.Audyssey EQ setup was fast and useful enough...not really something I would do again since i didn't really like how it tuned. I ended up re-tuning by ear and found this to be the way to get the best sound out."
4,"Heartwarming, but not simple tale","Chicken Dreaming Corn is a heartwarming but not simple tale of first generation immigrants. The backstory we receive through flashbacks that provide ever deeper understanding of the current struggles.Morris is the center of the family and the story: everything is viewed through the prism of his understanding. The children end up predictably rejecting their heritage, but in time, they take their places in their family's future.A great read, I finished it in two days & will look for more by Roy Hoffman"
3,Good to mediocre,"This picture dictionary is very well illustrated, and is superbly suitable as a visual aid when teaching. A vast number of topics are covered. The only ones missing are the latest technological subjects such as DVD, internet and others, but that's due to it being produced in 1989.My big disappointment with this book is the size of the Kanji - for the simple kanji characters the size is acceptable. But the complex ones are a spludge of ink and it's near impossible to work out what the detail is.Furigana is featured on some of the Kanji, but why not all? Surely this is mandatory?Excellent book though. Would be nice to see a new revised edition that addresses the above 2 issues."
1,Read Review Carefully,"This book is totally mis-reperesented on the basis of its title. It is NOT for use by English speakers. It is directed exclusively and only toward Japanese speakers and readers who wish to improve their English. It's a great book for the Japanese. If you're looking to learn Japanese from it, forget it."
1,Nearly Useless for English Speakers,"If you are an English speaker trying to learn Japanese, then this book is useless. It does not give the romaji or kana pronunciations so anyone who can not already read the very complex Kanji will be unable to know how to pronounce the words in the illustrations. Furigana phonetic transcriptions are given for some of the Kanji but not for all. Watch out for this problem with other Japanese/English picture dictionaries as some of the other dictionaries have the same defect."
4,A view you don't usually see,"If you're like me, the everything about the early days of space flight is captivating. I've read other accounts of this time period, including the incredibly in-depth michener novel ""Space"". What you don't often see is the view from the controller's booth. You don't see that often there was absolutely no data or voice communications between early spacecraft and the ground. You don't see the months of drills that Mission Control would stage, only to encounter problems that they could never have dreamed. Consequently, this account is a good read, and I enjoyed it. You may occasionally get bogged down by Franz's desire to name almost every person he can think of, as well as the endless acronyms. The jacket makes a big connection with Apollo 13. It is misleading because the book is far more comprehensive than that. Despite these shortcomings, I found it hard to put down and eye-opening."
4,a fist hand report of the early NASA years,I highly recommend this book to all the poor men who already believe today that APOLLO is a whole fakeKRANZ tell the truth it is obvious when you read him
2,Disappointing,"I consider myself an afficianado of the U.S. space program of the 1960s and early '70s, so I eagerly anticipated the arrival of Kranz's book.Kranz has always seemed to be a man of the utmost integrity, dedication and competence. But a page-turning writer he is not. If he used a ghost writer on this book he was ripped off, seeing as how the prose is dry as dust.The book is likely a valuable contribution to history, but it will probably be more referenced in future books than it will be read in its entirety."
5,Outstanding,"Gene Kranz is a legend and rightfully so. Although best known for his role as flight director for Apollo 13, he was with Mission Control from the beginning and as a result set the high standards that continue to this day."
4,Great Rememberance of an exciting time in America's race into space.,"Amazed at the amount of detail Mr. Kranz put into his memoir.Once I got a good handle on his writing style, I speed read through the technical explanations.Nevertheless, this was a fascinating read and insight into the inner working of what was accomplished in those early days of space travel.I was a teenager in 1963 and am in awe of how brave our astronauts truly were.And Mr. Kranz is right up there in my mind. Leadership, courage, quick-thinking. A real American Hero himself."
5,The best way to learn about spaceflight is through this book,"Failure is not an OptionThe first time I heard this sentence is when I saw the movie Apollo 13 (Tom Hanks), when I was only 7 years old. I then read the book only when I was 11 years old. Gene Kranz is a great writer as well as a great Flight Director.The book explains about everything from Mercury, through Gemini, to Apollo in great detail. The book taught me a lot of stuff that I did not know such as that Gemini 7 was before Gemini 6A. The book explains why did it happen and how. It will also explains what they were going to do about it.The book has 21 pictures and 397 pages of knowledge. I recommend it for everybody"
5,Fantastic,"Wow, a fantastic book from a living legend! I never had the priviledge of meeting Mr. Krantz when I was working for NASA. Too bad! A must read that leaves all the other books about the human space program in general and Apollo in particular in the moon dust."
5,Amazing,"Really amazing, a book written by a man who contributed to create the dream of american space exploration. It's unbelieveble to read HOW we were technologically far from today. A nostalgic narration, absolutely MUST HAVE.ALESSANDRO MARIANI"
3,"""Family Planning Is Not An Option""","Boy, seems like a chapter didn't go by without finding out that Gene's wife was pregnant once again. I know he's Roman Catholic, but geez! :)Joking aside, I ultimately enjoyed the book because it gave me some insight into the job of a flight controller and I enjoy reading about space exploration. I only gave it 3 stars because while the content was page turning, I found the writing style to be less than engaging.Some reviewers say Kranz comes off as full of himself, but I didn't see that at all. He uses the word ""I"" a lot because it's an autobiography of his career. Give him a break.After reading his book, I have a lot of respect for Kranz. He left a legacy of effective Mission Control combined with a complete lack of Birth Control."
1,"Unfortunately, Refund is Not an Option!","I fully understand that Gene Kranz is not a writer, but at the same time, Mr. Kranz should also come to grips with that same fact. This book had the potential to be so much more than the equivalent of a seventh grade account of a summer holiday. If Mr. Kranz would have availed himself of the services of a professional writer or editor this book could of really been a completely different experience. There was only the slightest attempt to translate the technology of the time into terms that can be understood today.After reading this book, the NASA space program of the 1960's and 1970's has all the cachet of a Thursday afternoon at the local Post Office."
4,Gene Kranz - Biographical review - Leadership in Space exploration,"Having been interested in this period of the initial years of the space program, I was hoping to gleen more insite into events and people during this period. I was not let down as some of the details and specifically the difficult logistics of operations was layed out and described. All this without the technology that we have today for satellite communication/Internet etc. Superb description of the Apollo 11 landings and mindset for success of the Apollo 13 events, showing the stunning and legendary team building abilities and decision making insites of the period. Worth reading for anyone interested in those years of Space Exploration."
3,A good first effort which falls short...,"A fairly good description of the manned space program up to the end of Apollo from the Mission Control side, this book still leaves the reader wanting greater perspective on the overall effort to reach the Moon. Yes, the writing is unpolished, but the style does capture the man who played a critical role in the early years of the NASA Mission Control--Gene Kranz is a true American original. There is little new material here, but there are a few interesting anecdotes. More discussion of the post-Apollo era would have made this book a much better tome. Furthermore, some of the criticism of NASA today is a bit off base. The NASA of today is a much different place than the one Kranz was a part of in the Cold War era, and warrants a different vision than the space agency of 30 years ago. I enjoyed this book, and recommend it for space buffs. A better book for the casual reader, however, is probably ""Moonshot"" by Deke Slayton and Alan Shepard."
2,I must have been sent a different book!,"I'm ""into"" space and have enormous respect for the author. The book covers the most exciting events in recent history and should be a page turner. It's not. I found it mind-numbingly boring. With a few rare exceptions, the book reads like a poorly written diary. I was amazed at the brief coverage of Apollo 1, even though I know the author must agonize about it still. I wish he had put more of what he really felt into the effort."
5,Action packed -- Non-Fiction!,"Stuck in an airport, I searched the bookstore for a good book...little did I know I'd stumble onto this gem. As a sleepy 3-year-old when my parents woke me to see the moon landing, I grew up, knowing little about the America's newborn space program...I figured this book would tell me some interesting stories...and it did! It might be hard to imagine action behind a desk at Mission Control, but I couldn't wait to hear more stories after a description of the first launch. Although sometimes over-detailed in who did what between the launches, and sometimes it seemed like a Senior Class yearbook in it's roll-call lauding, I was really hooked on hearing about the program. I highly recommend this to anyone who is even remotely interested in flight, and to those who like a good book. It's like The Right Stuff meets Yeager meets Apollo 13."
5,Living History and Inspiration for Our Times,Failure is not an Option: Mission Control from Mercury to Apollo 13 and BeyondThis book came highly reccommended by other teachers at Advanced Space Academy for Educators. It is a great companion to A Man on the Moon.Gene Kranz is an inspiration for us all. In today's world we need his message. He makes one feel that if we can go to the moon then we can accomplish anything that we set out as a nation to do.
5,"Space, did we lose our way?",Gene's memories from the first halting attempts to launch rockets into space through the successfull Apollo moon program paint vivid pictures of what happened inside the space agency on a non-technical level in building the space program. Good review of challenging and motivating people to envision the what-if and do it step by step. Small references to lack of vision in senior leadership of space program after the Kennedy moon goal was achieved.
2,Not Much New,"The history has been told, and better, in other books. If not for Apollo 13, the movie, Kranz would be an unknown. His contributions to space were no more than a half dozen others, and less than some like the fabled Christopher Kraft.Kranz is no writer; it's the personal stuff that gives his book any credence. Unfortunately, he put an awful lot of focus on himself without much mention of the people who brought in on board, then trained him.The tidbits about life in NASA are interesting. But as a history, this is just another average memoir by somebody who got lucky with a movie."
1,Worse Than OEM,Made in the USA. I measured resistance of the shortest wire from the set and it was ~3.8k Ohms. My old OEM Delco wire was ~2.4k Ohms! This SMP plug wire set would be a downgrade. I checked some of the longer ones and same thing; more resitance than my Delco's. Also the plugs ends were a little larger and could be a fitment issue.
2,Disappointed,"I just failed to be interested in Auster's experiences or memories. For me, it wasn't worth either the time or the cost."
2,Bland,The book is an easy read but the connnections that the author makes are very tennuous. He talks about coincidences in life but the stories he writes about are vague and far-fetched. The style of writing is not all that creative so the book does not offer very much.
1,"Auster is overhyped, overexposed, and is overdoing the books","ENOUGH already. Yes, there were some interesting books, especially the earlier ones. But now that Auster has become a wealthy boy who can publish whenever he wants to, the public is getting loaded down with dreck. Enough already. You don't have to publish every single word you write."
4,"I don't know, I kinda liked it","I've missed out on the Paul Auster hype, and I'm not done with the book yet, but I like this one."
3,Customer service terrible,"Ordered 8 of the file cabinets. One recieved was damaged and we wanted to return one. Contacted Shoplet 11/12/2009 and recieved e-mail that we would hear within 4 days return information. Today is 12-18-2009, I contacted again on 12-15-2009 and still no response. I would think twice about ordering from this vendor."
1,Review for Steelmaster Card File Drawer,"Hey Guys,I bought this Card File Drawer thinking I could organize all my cards. Unfortunately it doesn't come with an Alphabetical Card Index to separate and organize my cards by name of company or by person's name... This, in my opinion, defeats the purpose of a card ""FILE"" drawer (It's just a drawer). I would have been better off with a rollodex... Just beware there is no system to organize your cards, just the cabinet..."
1,Not worth the $$,"This set is very cheaply made. I knew the make-up wasn't real which was what I wanted, but I was surprised and disappointed that the make-up brushes have hard plastic instead of soft bristles. They even scratched their skin now and then when the kids would ""pretend"" on eachother. I threw away the eye make-up brushes which were all plastic, as it seemed dangerous for use around the eyes. I would have preferred a foam end or a soft brush so they could safely ""apply eye-shadow"" on themselves or others. Eventually I replaced all of the brushes with some of my own little brushes that come with real make-up. This set should be seen at the dollar store shortly!"
2,this toy is not worth the money,"I bought this toy from target, it didnt come with te lipsticks or the compact but its the exact same thing, its a waste of money. My 3 year old absolutely had to have this toy so we bought it. When you look at it quick you think oh a makeup set alright. Then when you take a better look its ohh the make up brushes are all plastic not even real. The eyeshadow, all plastic too, well at least she can use the kleenex, okay once bcz theres only one piece! Im completely dissapointed and now that shes had it not even a week and it just sits there its going back to the store,. but hey i guess the nailpolish wont spill..."
5,Great for a toddler girls imagination!,I bought this in addition to the barbie head and it is wonderful fun! The hair dryer runs on batteries and it sounds real. It is a great addition to the barbie head because that alone doesn't come with much for kids to keep occupied but this does!
4,A Fun Play Set,"I bought this accessory set to accompany a vanity I got for my daughter's 2nd birthday. The best part about this set is the ""working"" hair dryer. The switch is simple enough that my 2-year-old can turn it on and off herself. It doesn't really blow air out, but it makes noise like a real hair dryer. The little lipsticks and eyeshadow are fun for pretend play. I only have two complaints: 1) the mirrored compact is difficult for small hands (and sometimes even my hands) to open, and 2) the brushes do not have real bristles. I ended up giving my daughter some of my old makeup brushes to play with so they would be more gentle on her skin. But she has enjoyed playing with this set and I would recommend it overall."
4,Fun accessories,"I purchased this for my 3 yr old granddaughter to go with a vanity she has. Her favorite is the blow dryer that actually works and sounds like Mommy's blow dryer. I was dissappointed that the brushes are just hard plastic, but overall was pleased with the product."
3,3-yr-old really likes the hairdryer,Daughter really likes this set. She is always in my makeup and loves that she has her own. Her favorite items in the set are the real sounding hair dryer and the compact with makeup sponge.
4,2 year old Christmas Gift,"Product was as I expected and described. I wish the brushes were real instead of plastic (gotta watch she doesn't stick it in her eye). Otherwise, my little one loves playing with the polish & lipstick."
1,Piece of Junk,"I bought this accessory set because it was recommended with the barbie styling heads. What a piece of junk. Everything is a piece of molded plastic - even the makeup brushes. I could have given my daughter a fork to use with the set. The eye shadow and lipstick look real and then SURPRISE open it to find hard molded plastic. I stupidly assumed when this was recommended with the styling head, that some it actually was real makeup that could be applied to the head. This should cost [...] at Walmart.What a piece of junk and what a disappointment to my daughter at Christmas."
3,"dictionary does not have any pin-yin, not useful unless you read chinese","i bought the dictionary, hoping to use it as a reference tool to teach my 4 year old chinese. i am a native speaker myself. it is a good reference, if you can read chinese characters. But since it doesn't have pin-yin, you really can't use the dictionary to learn how to pronounce any of the words."
1,"Don't bother, Don't waste your money",I live in outback Australia books are my only opportunity to learn about Directing so I must be choosy.Directing 101 is so general in its descriptions of film makeing and directing. Half this book is a Glossary.If you live outside America this book is not for you. I feel cheated
3,Not bad but...,"OK i happen to really like JAK normally and was soo excited for this trilogy to be in one book, but it didnt really live up to my expectations of her. In all fairness i didnt yet read the last story but i found that the relationships felt rushed and although the characters were likeable, the plots were so boring I had to force myself through them. All in all not her best but maybe bc they are shorter stories. who knows. still not bad if you have nothing to do one evening."
1,Mistaken Identity...,Did not realize that this book was a combination of three books by Ms. Krentz. Unfortunately I had read all three previously. So will pass it on.
5,How Wonderful......Three in One,"All three are exceptional is all I can say. What a wonderful way to read the triology, one of Jane's best."
5,Review by my son Morgann- 8 yrs old,"I like this game because the graphics are cool, there are all sorts of enemies coming and you have to really focus when you are fighting a boss. The heros have different gun weapons like flame thrower or a an electronic laser beam. I like the way you can change into different characters. That gives more variety to the game. You need to change characters at the right time so strategy is important. The bosses are difficult because they have different elements. Kids ages 6-16 will enjoy this game. Its a game that you can master but also you can enjoy it for a long time."
4,"Great watch, but indiglo is too light","For the price, I could easily give this 5 stars. The only point I have against this watch is that the indiglo is not that visible, compared to my other Timex watches. So if you have less than perfect eyesight, don't count on seeing the time at night.Plus points: Very attractive watch. I like the sound of the alarm. Another good feature is the half-time reminder while using the timer. This makes it very useful during my lunchbreak.Overall, an excellent buy."
4,timex watch,this is a great watch. it is a little hard to see in the dark using the light feature. the stopwatch is fun to use during exercise!
1,Timex watch,I wasn't at all familiar with this type of watch. I hated it! It kept turning on my wrist to where the face was on the side of my wrist. Couldn't get it to stay on top of my wrist. Drove me crazy. It's well made and was packaged well and kept good time though.
4,Good Watch,"I ordered this watch just before Christmas for my wife. It was to replace a similar model that was a couple of years older. The price was perfect, quite cheap, and the watch had all the features of the last watch and was in perfect condition. This watch has all the functions she needs and the sport band holds up the the toughest play that our 2.5 year old daughter can put it through. Overall a great watch for a great price."
2,Disappointment.................,"I recently bought this watch from amazon for my sister.I was very much disappointed after receiving the watch.According to me it has following cons:1) Color: The color is totally different than as it appears on website2) Indiglo: It's useless. You can't see anything.3) The major problem is, it is not a new watch. It has black marks and scratches on its belt. So surely they sold me an old watch saying it is new.I am going to return it and buy something else..."
2,Not worth it,My five year old wasn't impressed with this = the paper gets caught and doesn't rip well. The markers don't stay in the holes - the desk is clunky and akward. Buy a coloring book and call it a day!
3,where r da refills...but cool,"When i saw this i thought 'how fun and educational' - which it is. it's teaching kids to write letters the 'old - fashioned' way without emails and how to do fun, creative art. I LUV IT!"
1,don't get shanghaied into buying this book,This guidebook is impractical to use. It is thick and bulky so makes it impractical to carry around in a purse. Bring a backpack to carry this mini telephone book around.The writing is somewhat dry and out of date as well.I found the Lonely Planet guide much better for getting around. It can fit in a handbag or pocket
3,Not a raucous a previous efforts,It seems jack has settled down to the family life and his songs have mellowed. Buzz Me In is definitely not as rocking as Mood Elevator but the songs are tight and well produced. Let's hope this mellowing trend doesn't continue and Jack gets back to some rock and roll!
2,Ugh...,This album is instantly forgettable. Not one stand out track. I listened to it maybe a total of two times. What happened to the Logan of Bulk and Mood Elevator? Those cd's still get plenty of time in the ol' cd player. Buy either of those for quality Logan and do yourself a favor by skipping Buzz and Angel...
4,Puts a smile on my face,I love this CD....I only wish that more music was included....maybe another disc?
2,Beware of salt stains,"If you are wearing these every day in a place where salt is used on roads and sidewalks, beware. The salt stains the suade despite care. As well, they are not water proof. So you will look lovely but your feet will be wet!"
4,"Right Church, Wrong Pew","UGGs are fine. Packed well, sized properly.Problem is that the actual supplier is on the West Coast (not identified prior to the purchase) and took two work days after the purchase to actually ship the boots, so I missed an anticipated opportunity to give them to my buddy during a visit.Had I known the ship point and real expected lead time, I would have purchased elsewhere, as one provider's price was vitually the same as every other seller."
5,One happy 13 year old,My daughter's feet keeping growing so I had to find her size 11 Uggs for Christmas. Had no problem finding her size and wanted style in time.
4,Sweet!,My daughter loves these boots but didn't realize they would stain. Make sure to buy sheepskin stain protector and apply before wearing.
5,great,"The boots were just as described and arrived on time for Christmas. Although I do NOT understand the high cost of this brand name, my daughters love it"
2,Comfy but they STINK!,"I've been getting UGGs for a while now, because they're super soft and really comfortable. It is recommended that you wear them without socks but take heed; the fur that supposedly wicks away moisture (this doesn't seem to happen with mine) and allows for airflow seems to hold the scent of stinky feet. I don't think that it is just my feet that are exceptionally smelly because I don't have this problem with other shoes, and I have friends who have had the same experience with UGGs."
1,"poor quality,","Ordered UGGS for my daughter in November, by mid January noticed a hole in one boot on the toe area , in about two weeks - hole on the second boot in the same place. Was trying to contact the seller for an exchange of boots- impossible to.....I am really disappointed...."
2,Not Impressed,"Considering the price of these shoes, I expected them to last longer than two seasons (yes, I did spray them). They're comfortable until the fur wears away and then the shoes rip, fall apart, and look all around UGGly. I would recommend a pair of Sorrels or some other brand that is more likely to last."
5,We love Uggs,We love just Uggs. They keep your feet warm and comfy during winters so I don't hesitate recommending this product.
2,Ugg Boots,"I like the boots, they are warm and very comfortable. I've had UGG boots every year for a long time. This is the first time I've had the black ones. They have stained my feet with black dye that won't come off. Very disappointing."
1,Poor quality,"I just purchased these boots this past Christmas for my daughter and now there is a huge hole in the top of the boot like someone cut it with a pair of scissors. She's only worn them 3 times and since our warranty expired 1 week ago, I can't return them and there is no way that i found to get in touch with the seller directly."
5,uggs-great,"I have wanted a pair of Ugg boots for 2 years. I finally bought a pair and I LOVE them. Cozy, warm and comfortable!"
4,UGG,"What can I say, they are UGGs and my daughter loves them. They are keeping her feet warm right now and as long as they last the winter, i'm happy."
1,Absolute Fraudsters - DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS COMPANY,"Ordered a pair of Ugg boots from Ugg Fashion Australia and paid an extra 5 to ensure delivery within 5 days. After one week the item had not been received and when I contacted the company via email they advised me the item had not been sent and there would be a further delay - nice of them to let me know!. I decided to cancel the item and I've been waiting for the payment ever since (3 weeks at the time writing this review). I would absolutely recommend that you do not deal with this company, they are a fraud - I have now disputed the payment via my bank."
5,UGG,"Got these boots for my daughter for Christmas. Ordered on line, and had them shipped direct to her. I ordered her normal shoe size and the boots fit perfectly. The shipping was timely and free, so happy all the way on these boots"
5,UGG Australia classic short boot,"The UGG boot I purchased (size 7 in ""Sugar"") was a perfect fit. Great quality, nice color, and very comfortable. I'm sure I'll get a lot of wear out of them especially in cold weather. Very cozy! I usually wear a size 7-1/2 or 8 in most shoes, but after reading other reviews about the boot sizing being large, I opted for a size 7. It was perfect!!"
5,The real deal,"I bought these for my niece who so unselfishly wrote on her birthday wish list ""knock-off uggs"" because she knew her parents couldn't afford them. So I got her the real thing. They arrived within days of the order (very quick delivery) and her parents told me the first thing she did was check the label because she couldn't believe she got the real thing. And sure enough the label said ""made in Australia"". I guess that meant they were real. Best gift ever!"
5,Confusing,"I LOVE my Uggs but trying to order a new pair here and Im confused as to why all of the women's Uggs are sized in mens sizes. Women's have a W, Men's have an M, and all of the women Uggs are sized M8 for example. If I ordered these they would be huge. I checked with Ugg to be sure it wasn't Wide and Medium, but was told that no... it is men's and women's sizes. I wish this was more clear. Has everyone had to translate their show size to mens who have ordered Uggs from here? Just curious!UGG Australia Classic Short Boots"
5,"Fun color, great price, great service",These are authentic Uggs at a great price. Shipping was prompt. Would recommend this seller. Thanks!
5,Excellent Transaction!!!,The whole transaction was wonderful...excellent shipping time and the product is lovely...my toes are stylishly toasty warm!!!!!
5,Great boots and quick delivery,"I ordered these boots for my 26 year old daughter for Christmas. It was too late for Christmas delivery when I ordered. But to my amazement, I received it on Christmas eve less than 48 hours after I ordered them online. My daughter had picked them out herself online and I paid. You can imagine how thrilled and shocked she was on Christmas morning when she opened the gift and found her favorite boots inside. She already had the same pair in black and wanted the Chestnut this year. She loves them. Great Christmas Surprise!"
5,Ugg Australia Women's Classic Short Boot,"Received correct product in timely manner. They were a Christmas present for my daughter. It's just what she wanted, but has not had a chance to wear them yet."
2,Normally LOVE UGG’s but not this pair,"I love UGG’s and have always been impressed by there comfort and quality but this pair let me down. Bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She was thrilled to have her own pair and I was happy not having to share my own boots. The reason I’m giving these 2 stars out of 5 is that my daughter has worn these 6 times and the stitching across the arch and on the side of the right boot has come undone. Would have loved to have made an exchange, however since this was an order fulfilled by Amazon I am not able to do so. I’ll wait for the refund and purchase another pair. Hoping to give the new pair a 5 star rating."
5,sister loves them.,"My sister likes them a lot. She says they are warm, comfortable, and are ""in style."" A good gift for a sibling or girlfriend."
5,Ugg Classic Short Boot,Didn't think I needed these boots but I really like them and they are warm. Husband gave them to me for Christmas.
4,Boo's Boots,"I purchased Uggs for my daughter for Christmas, she loves them & lives in them. :) I recommend purchasing water proofing to protect them."
1,Don't buy from shoe parlor...,"I bought a pair of uggs a size larger than i needed, when i got them they tore as soon as i put them on, so i sent them back. I got another pair and have worn them around 20 times and got yet another hole. Very displeased. Also looks worn on tall back even though i've never had any clothes rubbing on it."
2,fair but,I could not get my foot through the narrow opening without forcing it. So I'm not sure if they really fit. I am returning them today. I'll buy them at a department store where I can try them on before I buy. They seem well made other than that.
4,limited info for review,"These were for my daughter. She says she loves them but she really has not had them long since we had to exchange for a smaller size. Even sizing down as advised on the first order, we needed to go smaller. I purchased the smaller size outright at the same time we shipped he first pair back as a way to expedite the turnaround. That always makes me a little nervous when dealing with a merchant for the first time (while ordered through Amazon, these involve a third party). However, happily the credit for the first pair did come through last week."
1,Bad For Your Feet; Why So Popular?,"Hands down, UGG is probably the most popular shoe of the 20th century. But why?They reek when you wear them for a long time, have no arch support, and wouldn't you like to be yourself, and not blend in?I would NOT reccomend any UGG product."
1,FAKE UGGS!,We were sent fake Uggs. The color of the two boots didn't even match. I am very dissapointed in Amazon and cannot do business with a company that does not supervise its supplier better. We have discussed this matter directly with Ugg.
5,Great Boots,I ordered these as a gift and the recipient loves them! She says that they are extremely comfortable and stylish.
2,UGG's- UG,"I have always wanted a pair of UGGs. I must say that ordering shoes on-line is not my favorite way. Shoes must be tried on, but with UGGs I thought I would be safe. One was tighter than the other and there is a different color pine needle on the back heel of one. So they are a little too different for me.I wanted to exchange them for another pair. BEWARE! You can not exchange if you got the Amazon credit card and received the $50.00 off. If I returned them, I basically would have to eat the $50.00. So I'm keeping the UGGs. UG!"
5,Great,My wife LOVES her new UGG's. She had other boots similar to the UGG's but her feet would still get cold even inside at her job.
5,Wife is very Happy!!!,I wasn't sure they would live up to the hype but ordered them for my wife for Christmas. A week later she is still gushing about how happy she is with these boots. She wears a 6.5 and I ordered a 6 as recommended by other reviewers and they were perfect.
1,unhappy,"I love the ugg classic short boots tremendously; I actually already have a pair in black. I decided to order another pair in a different color but when they came, they were too tight. Now I have to go thru the ordeal of returning them. I bought the first pair at the store so thought it would be okay to get this pair online.... not a good idea. Just be careful."
1,POOR QUALITY,"I will never order uggs from here ever again. The insides of the boots did not live up to my expectations. The ones I currently have are real uggs. These aren't. Very cheap feel and not enoughfluff inside. Also, there is a silk tag in mine with the logo in a metallic silver. These do not and the sole is not correct. Look at the actual ugg site for the correct looking sole. These just say ugg ugg and a sun on the middle. Nothing else. It's pathetic. These people sent me an email stating they are authorized by ugg. Definitely not!!!!THE VENDOR DENIED MY REQUEST FOR A RETURN LABEL AND I HAD TO FILE A DISPUTE."
3,UGG classic short boots - women's,"I do like my new UGG boots. They are quite warm. The only trouble is that they do not have the best traction. I never slipped in my Aussie Dogs boots, which were just as warm and comfy. I would give the UGGS more stars except for the traction factor. They don't seem to have much at all. I will probably buy Aussie Dogs next time."
5,Best boots ever!!!,"They're light weight, warm and stylish. What else could you ask for. They are well worth the price and more. I do not regert this decision for a second. Remeber to order a size down from what you think you need ex. I am a 7 1/2 and was going to get an 8 but got a 7. The fit is perfect."
5,Classic Uggs - Simply the Best!,"I was a hit for Christmas. All the ladies in my life received Uggs as a gift. This one went to my youngest daughter, and she was so thrilled. Big Daddy certainly secured a few good points on this one :-) You can't go wrong with the Classic -- there is no mistaking these boots from among the imitators out there on the market."
5,Essential & Must-Have Boots,"This is my first ever boots and worth every penny. Very warm and comfortable and nothing can beat that! After trying on other brands like Zodiac and Emu Stinger in stores I would prefer Ugg. At first i wanted the black color but i noticed that the suede texture is a little bit different coz' manufacturers put more dye as compared to other colors so i got the chocolate brown. I would recommend this Ugg boots to everyone who's looking for comfort, warmth and style. This is a must-have during cold season and very much essential for me."
4,Great boots!,My daughter loves her new UGGS! Nice quality and doesn't show dirt as much as other colors. I Highly recommend!
1,Uggs,"The uggs were too small so I returned them for a full refund... i have yet to get my 150 dollars back!!! I had them tracked and a confirmation that they received them way before Christmas, but they have not reimbursed me yet, and I am frustrated."
1,Horrible,"My dad bought a pair of the grey uggs and sent them to my college. I was really excited to receive them, as I've wanted a pair of uggs for the longest. When I took them out of the box I immediately noticed that the outside of one of shoes looked paper- like. That same boot was thin and far less plush than the other. I'm pretty sure they sent me a real boot and a fake one in the same box. Needless to say I will be returning them ;("
1,Not sure they were authentic.,These boots did not compare to my other UGGs which made me doubt their authenticity. They did not fit like my other UGGs did and the suede looked cheap. Since the price was the same as my store-bought UGGs I returned them. I'll buy these in a store not online.
1,Do not buy,"These boots are fake. I received a gray pair from my mother for Christmas, and it is quite appearant that they are not real. Don't waste your money. We will be returning them and buying an authentic pair"
3,Gift for girlfriend,Got these for my girlfriend as a gift. She chose them and seems to like them a lot. I think they are a bit boring looking though.
2,returned them,"i have read that if you open your uggs and they have a chemical smell, they are not real uggs. that is what happened when I opened this box of uggs, and so i returned them. At the time that I ordered them, no one else had the periwinkle available. but i did subsequently order and recieve them from zappos.com and these arrived with no mysterious odor."
5,Women's Classic Short Boot Grey Uggs,I'd wanted a pair of Uggs for a long time and decided to treat myself! I haven't been disappointed! They are so comfortable! I thought it would bother me or take me awhile to get used to not wearing socks with them but it's great! I have a feeling I will treat myself again sometime to more!
4,nice boots,Although i had to return...The shoes were in perfect shape. They were packaged neatly and definitely authentic uggs. Only returned because they were to small. Guess my daughters feet have grown.
4,They have held up well after 1 year,My daughter has loved these and worn them what seems like almost every day for a year. They are holding up very well. The only reason I gave them a 4 instead of a 5 is that I feel the UGG brand is a bit overpriced.The seller delivered the product quickly and it was well packed.
5,Great product,This was a gift and the recipient just loved the color and quality. Excellent service as well. Will order again.
5,Great boots for the PNW winter,"Picked these boots up for my wife after her light brown pair that she's had for over 10 years now are looking a bit, and I really do mean 'a bit', tired. She wanted some black ones to go with other cloths she has this pair and her light brown pair are exclusively used during the winter here in Seattle, she loves them and wouldn't trade them for anything."
2,Impossible to get on,"With both of us pushing and pulling with all our might, we could not get these boots over the heel. So, if you buy a pair, be sure to get a return guarantee. I think UGG sells some with fasteners. If you have trouble with boots, in general, try a pair of those."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM PELTZ SHOES. FAKE FAKE FAKE!,"DO NOT PURCHASE UGG AUSTRALIA BOOTS FROM PELTZ SHOES. THEY ARE A FAKE PAIR OF UGGS.I happily completed the transaction only to receive the products and realize they were a counterfeit.I have a pair of the Gray Classic Short uggs already. When i compared the two, the inside of the peltz pair was not sheepskin, instead it was a rough materials resembling fake fibers. I called the store and they refused to admit that the shoes were not authentic."
1,Poor Quality UGG Claasic - proably a knock-off,"Purchased a pair of UGG Classic Short Women's boots for my wife for Christmas and found out they are probably a pair of cheaply made knock-offs. The inside is suppose to ""feature a soft foam insole covered with genuine sheepskin"" but in my case the pair I received for my wife, the sheepskin color (a orange yellow) comes off on her socks. I doubt this happens with real sheepskin, it hadn't with other sheepskin lined footwear we've owned. At any rate, I thought because I was buying from a vendor through Amazon that they would be authentic. Not the case. Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed!!!"
5,comfortable,"With all the fakes out, it a relief to find authenic boots true to price. These boots run big, so i had to go down a half a size, but there feel great"
1,Terrible the fur inside has a bald spot.,Terrible the fur inside the boot has a bald spot. I need to try to get a new pair my daughter is very disappointed
3,emu boot,"The boots have been very warm until today we received a lot of snow and I was outside shoveling over an hour and my feet started getting cold, they have water marks from the snow as well, I was a little suprised by this. I like how easy they are to put on and take off, overall pretty good deal."
4,ugg boot review,"Boots that I've got were fine. Right size, fine shape and every thing was ok. It is quite cold here in Russia, but I don't feel it when wearing these UGG Boots. The label says that fur is from Australia, but boots were made in China. People who wears such boots have to be careful when putting on, coz seams are weak, so boots can get broken easily"
2,Could not get past the texture and flavor..,"I hate to be the odd one out, because I would have loved to have been able to enjoy these as they are meant-- to sooth and lubricate the throat-- as I am a daily singer and could definitely use a little help here and there.I can't vouch for the effectiveness of these lozenges, because I simply couldn't get past the bitter taste and chalky feel in my mouth.I literally felt myself making faces the whole time I battled my desire to just let the stuff slip out anywhere, as long as it was no longer in my tongue. Haha..It may be due to my picky taste buds, I will admit. ^_^;Not for me, but worth a try if you can tolerate the described taste and feel."
2,Hmmmm,"Bought these once, won't buy again. I didn't really see how they helped anything. Cough, sore throat, i duno. Just didn't do much for me. they break apart in your mouth and taste like cardboard."
3,"A scholarly book, but still accessible","Quite a short book (just over 100 pages of meat) but it covers a lot of ground. Mostly it is concerned with the Stoic and Epicurean schools, and it compares them on a topic by topic basis. The Sceptics are (unsurprisingly) pretty much confined to epistemology, but their critiques of Stoic and Epicurean positions are frequently cited and commented on. One advantage of classical philosophy over most modern stuff is that the terminology is much simpler. This book could be read without any background in philosophy.All in all a pretty good read"
3,"Good ingredients, but not seeing any results",Astaxanthin is notorious for being important for your skin and eyes as a powerful anti-oxidant. I have nearly finished the entire bottle (two months worth) and have seen no noticeable difference in anything. Maybe the dosing of one per day is too low? I will take two per day to see if that gives better results. One per day is definitely not doing it for me.
5,A GRIPPING AND THOUGHTFUL THRILLER,The joy of this book is the way it treats its subject. Too many medical/biotech thrillers go for the schlock horror effect. OMEGA knows that its subject is genuinely terrifying and uses realistic scenes and believable characters to build a sense of crisis. The result is a thought-provoking and genuinely alarming read.
4,GOOD & PLENTY! GOOD story with PLENTY of Scary Stuff!,"This is a Really Great Book! I enjoyed this story great, the characters are great, the action is great, plot thickens wonderfully. Lynch hits the mark with this completely gross bug that kills everything in its way. Watch out for that little tickle in your throat..it might be Omega!!"
3,Interesting Reading,I liked this book. I took it on vacation with me and found myself in what spare time I had reading with enjoyment. The characters were challenging to get attached with and made me think constantly. I was surprised at the thin plot and that is why I gave it 3 stars. It was easy to recognize the villians of both sexes. This is the second book I have read by Mr. Lynch and would read his work again. I look forward to the next adventure.
2,Endless and Slow,"The story behind this book is what first caught my attention; overuse of antibiotics. It's a serious problem in today's society. The book is about a string of drug-resistant antibodies that are running loose in LA. The doctor, who is trying his hardest to fight this problem, faces a multitude of problems trying to find an answer. There is supposedly a cure, but only Dr. Ford can determine how much he's willing to sacrifice just to find the cure. It's a long and drawn out book that could have been about 200 pages shorter. The plot has been done to death by so many other authors. Don't bother with this one."
2,A Total Disappointment,"I bought this book with Richard Preston's Cobra Event because I like medical thrillers. I have read every Robin Cook book there is literally. After all of these GOOD authors, Omega was a complete disappointment. Understand this: I am thirteen years old and I read good books in three days max. Omega had me dragging on for about a month. And don't think I'm too immature to understand the 'big words'. After reading Robin Cook, I have decided to become a pathologist. I know many of the medical terms that he uses in his books. After reading Patrick Lynch, I have decided not to read his books ever again. If you want a good medical thriller, try Robin Cook (and dont read Coma or Brain- I think they are highly over-rated and extremely boring; read the later ones)."
4,Builds to a chilling conclusion,"After the horror and mayhem of 'Carriers' this novel is a smaller-scale, more personal story. But as sinister events unfold and the bigger picture begins to emerge, it become genuinely alarming. This is a tale with a real scientific agenda, and this adds to its power - even if the gore factor is reduced. An entertaining and thought-provoking read."
3,"Good subject matter, but sometimes too broing","I liked the book overall, but it didn't grip me like other books by Robin Cook. I liked the subject of resistant bacterial strains. This is definitely an issue doctors are going to be dealing with in the near future. I was surprised to find an article in either Popular Science or Discover magazine...I dont remember which...about this tantalizing subject."
1,"Boring, slow, predictable - a long way from Robin Cook","Omega has a beautifully designed cover. The writing inside, however, leaves the reader disappointed. The details, if you're interested in technical thrillers, are lacking; if you don't like techno-thrillers and enjoy a well constructed plot with fully human characters (if there must be a trade-off) you'll STILL be disappointed.Sore throats and hospital politics with no suspense, little tension, less than engaging prose and generally a waste of money...I bought my copy at an airport (and foolishly paid full price rather than going to Amazon.com) and listening to the drone of the 777 engines was as interesting as turning the pages of this novel.But turn them I did, convinced that the book just HAD to get better ... just a few more pages and it would all come together... well, forget it. Listen to the jet engine and save your six dollars."
3,Great book on Vacuum tubes,"Contains basic theory underlying the operation of all types of modern vacuum tubes, both radio and industrial , together with their more common applications"" 583 pages illustrated with numerous diagrams and several b&w; photos.Eastman was Head of the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Washington. Despite its title, Eastman's book emphasizes applications. Contains a thorough discussion of distortion in amplifiers; with special emphasis on intermodulation distortion. Very strong in transmitting and modulation theory. In addition, Eastman was one of the few authors who could clearly explain the theory of push-pull operation."
3,Vacuum Tube Reference Book,"The most recent book on Vacuum Tubes that I've found so far.Old technology may get superceded, but it doesn't cease to work. There are probably some situations where vacuum tubes are preferable.Not a recent book, nor is it comprehensive, so only three stars. Adequate basis for understanding the technology."
4,Does what you need it to for an excellent price,"The kit I received was actually the KIA kit, but they are the same except for the instructions. You will want to follow the KIA Optima part of the instructions for installation should you receive the same. Also a part of the trim piece that runs along the bottom started coming off when I was removing the mounting tabs not used for the Sonata. Once installed you can barely see this piece, so it's really not that big of a deal. I do not recall if the instructions mention removing the center console trim, but it was pretty easy. Just start by opening the ash tray, then gently pull from the bottom and work your way around the outside of the center console trim. There are two tabs at the bottom of it, and two at the top. And two clips near the bottom sides and two clips near the top sides. I used a dull flat-head screw driver to help remove it."
3,They Are What You Make Of Them,"Initially, I was not impressed based on an experiment I threw together with the ham and spreadable brie cheese I had handy. I just wanted to hurry up and be done with the disgusting result. I'm not too big on ham to begin with, but it seemed to be a good idea at the time...perhaps the combination was to blame, but for whatever the reason, I do not recommend it.I figured it might not be the Wasa crispbread's fault, so later I browsed the recipes online and stumbled across one that takes advantage of brie using fruit preserves. It was absolutely delicious.Though not bad, they are not delicious or satisfying on their own, but if you find a good combination of toppings, you can end up with a delicious treat that's perfect for snacking. The result really depends on what you put on them, as texture is the most prevalent contribution the Wasa crispbreads provide; their flavor is very subtle, and the crackers are very light, and crisp."
5,Exceeded my expectation with the quality,"I was very pleased to open the package, it is heavy duty steel and very good quality."
5,Darin Channels Jolson,"This album is a very generous sampling of the Bobby Darin treatment of some Tin Pan Alley standards. I think ""Liza"" by the Gershwins is the very best reason to buy the recording: Bobby sounds as if he's captured an updated spirit of Al Jolson. Admittedly, you have to be a Darin fan to want this album--if you're a Darin novice, start with ""That's All,"" ""This is Darin,"" and ""Great Gentlemen of Song"" first--then this one. It's terrible that Darin died at 37, or he'd be out-Bennetting Tony Bennett today, and duetting with Ray Charles too."
4,Rare Darin,Any fan of Bobby Darin should own this album. Most of the cuts are right on the mark (though I would advise that you skip Liza and Mame.) It is a testament to Darin's talent that he could even make drivel like Talk To The Animals an interesting piece of music.
5,Wonderful collection!!!,"I own six other Bobby Darin CD's. This CD offers songs that you won't find on the other CD's. These renditions feature Darin's fun, unique style. If you love his music then I'm sure you'll love this CD."
3,"There's something to it, but not his best","This book has a typical Ken Follett structure: suspense, interesting plot idea, and drama. But this time, the excitement was not warranted. For starters, the entire plot is in or around one house so the author has to try harder to pull it off; unfortunately, Follett does not. ""Whiteout"" reads like a rushed book, in the style of i-had-to-do-it-fast-because-my-publisher-wanted-something-out-by-the-deadline. In sum, do not read this book if you never read Follett before. Start out with either ""Pillars"" or ""Eye of the Needle"" and then move to this one if you are compelled. Hopefully the upcoming Pillars sequel ""World Without End"" will be Follett at his best."
5,Love this!,"I use this daily to get my kids ready for school. The temporal nature of music provides a subliminal cue about how much time they have to ignore my urging to get up: by the time the french horns come in, it is probably time to get up like mom says...; and it generally helps us keep moving. All of the selections on this CD are brisk, unlike those on the Mozart for Morning Coffee CD, which I also have, which has many surprisingly drowsy pieces on it. I acknowledge that the format of the compilation is murderous to the intention of the compositions in terms of structure of the movements, and so forth. However, it is still a very pleasant, useful compilation album, and much more energizing that simply tucking into a full-blown symphony at 7am, with maybe not enough time to finish it before time to get gone to school."
4,Chanson,"Mozart in the Morning; very nice morning classical music, you will love this music in the morning hours, and throughout the day. glad i purchased it."
2,WARNING - not compatible with all games!,"This controller acts like a Dual Shock controller--NOT like a Dual Shock 2 controller. That means that some games (for example, The Simpsons Hit & Run) will NOT work at all with this controller. You can use the screen, but you'll have to plug a Dual Shock 2 controller into the PS2 in order to play the game.Maybe there's a reason they chose to make this controller incompatible with some new games, but it's beyond me."
2,ps2 controller and game screen by Intec stinks,The game screen is too small to see and creates major eye strain. You are better off getting the bigger screens that sit on playstation2. I can't even get this controller to sell on ebay. Very disapointed.
4,Excellent,"this is useful if it ur first time playing playstation. u can look at yhe screen will looking at the button,plus it has better picture."
2,sucks,This toy is good but walmart has this for $39.82 on their site.Overall it is really cool and fun when you can take this on the road.
2,Enough Already!,"If reading is like listening, perhaps I have fallen prey to one of the non-listening bad habits described in the book. While Dr's Steil & Bommelje present a strong case for leaders to listen, their content and delivery are tedious.For each of the 10 Golden Rules there are ten action steps, i.e 100 steps. Some of the 100 steps have additional steps and some them include additional habits. In researching this book for application for leadership development, I was hoping to find a model that could be easily communicated and grasped by others. One hundred plus items just doesn't work for me.While I understood the the main points, I was worn down by the delivery of example after example, after example. Have you ever had a conversation with someone who takes forever to make their point and then continues to talk after the point has been made? Welcome to Listening Leaders."
2,Not the book for me.,"I am sure the book is great for someone that is already an expert, but I am very much a beginner. The first part of chapter 1 was over my head. If you are trying to go from system admin to network admin, and like me, you have almost zero experience with system admin lingo, skip this book."
1,Pass on this one...,"The title of this book is very misleading. There is little, if any, information to do with Disneyworld ""with Kids"". Any information provided is easily gotten elsewhere. Buy Frommers guide to DisneyWorld instead. It has lots of tips for traveling the Magic Kindom with kids."
2,Dalilah lacks sex appeal completely,"This is regarded by many critics as 'the classic' recording. However, buyer beware! Whilst Vickers voice is the amazing force of nature we can expect Rita Gorr sounds like a battle axe. Gorr's voice just isn't sexy at all. In addition the sound recording is far from top notch and shows its age.I bought this recording because many reviews recommended it. I already owned the superb Colin Davis (Jose Cura and Borodina on Erato Label) set but thought this must be a special recording. I was very disappointed. To my mind the two sets worth their money are Davis (Cura, Borodina) and Chung's (Domingo, Meier). Both are superb, with a Samson and Dalila who sound attractive and attracted. Both sets are well recorded in digital sound quality. Both have a Dalila who sounds like a beautiful diva rather than an old dame.This old Pretre (Vickers, Gorr) set was bettered years ago. Don't bother before checking out the far superior competition."
4,Hope...,"Many live life with little hope, and Mrs Guthrie leads us to have hope all year. Hope is the theme of many of her books and this one is no exception."
5,Best Daily Devotional,"This devotional is not just for the grieving but anyone who is experiencing suffering and difficulties. I have read many devotionals over the years but this one has been my favorite. Her insights are truly God-breathed. I learned so many new things about passages I was already familiar with. And I bought several copies to keep on hand to give away when someone loses a loved one or is experiencing a trial. When you feel like you don't know how to help a friend in pain, give them this devotional. I've never found anything better!"
5,THE ONE YEAR BOOK OF HOPE,"THIS BOOK IS WONDERFUL!!! I READ IT DAILY! SEVERAL TIMES A DAY!MY LITTLE GIRL WENT TO HEAVEN 19 MONTHS AGO, SHE WAS 20 MONTHS OLD, SHE HAD MITOCHONDRIAL DISEASE, THIS IS A VERY RARE AND PROGRESSIVE NEUROMUSCULAR DISEASE. LIFE IS VERY HARD FOR ME, ITS A STRUGGLE, BUT I CAN PICK THIS BOOK UP AND READ JUST ONE PAGE AND THE PAIN IS NOT AS BAD. I LOVE IT!! IT HELPS ME GO ON!!I READ ""HOLDING ON TO HOPE"" WHILE MY BABY WAS SICK, AND I WOULD JUST THINK ""GOSH, I HOPE THAT I CAN BE STRONG LIKE THIS AUTHOR""!, THEN AFTER MY BABY DIED, I WAS ON AMAZON AND THIS BOOK WAS SUGGESTED TO ME. IT IS REALLY GREAT, I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE."
5,Great CD,"All the tracks are hot, they need to put out more gospel rap like this for the young geerations like myself."
5,Incredible,"This CD is outstandin! There are some songs on here that are just sick. Lecrae has really outdone himself, and Im not just saying that. The girl on this album (Diamone) has a beautiful voice, and the other featured artists are some of my favorite. Definitely worth the money, no doubt!"
3,My son's choice,"My son wanted this one. It is not my choice in music....but then I am not 21. I will say this though...the guy CAN sing....the last song on the CD proved that. So, after hearing what I do not consider ""real"" music, it was a pleasent suprise. I will admit the message is fairly clear."
5,Awesome,This album is awesome. Some real lyrics that speak to reality of life challenges without all the trashy words and explicit language.
5,I LOVE THIS CD!!!,I bought this CD for my husband who is a crazy about secular rap to see how he reacts to this Christian Rap well I downloaded it on my computer and this CD is amazing. I see why everyone has a good review for Lecrae because he is truly talented and using his talent to glorify God. Every song has a positve message about what Christ has done for us. I believe this CD and Flame's Our Fallen World will reach out to alot of unsaved and people who struggle to live a saved life if they truly want to live for God. THIS CD IS A MUST BUY! Buy one for yourself a family member or friend pass the Word of God through Christian Rap around.
5,Another great CD from Cross Movement,This CD ministers to my soul. I shared it with a non-Christian and his response was that this was as good as Ludacris but without the swearing and bad message.
5,SEND ME AL GO !!!!,WHY DOESNT THIS EXIST IN SCOTLAND !! ????WHY DO I HAVE TO IMPORT HIPHOP CHRISTIAN MUSIC !!AM GONA DO MY BEST TO FOLLOW IN THESE GUYS FOOTSTEPSGET MUSIC OF GOD OUT THERE TO SCOTLANDS CORUPTED YOUTH !!SEND ME AL GO !!!KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK - LOVE GOD AND LOVE ONE ANOTHER !
4,Man you talkin' about crunk...,"Lecrae lays it down! And it's still Gospel, but with a beat. He truly has a message worth listening."
3,"Great Printer, But Ink Eater","The printer itself is a great product, especially for the price. The print-outs are of excellent quality and it prints fairly fast. However, it goes through ink SO FAST! I don't use it extremely often and I go through one black cartridge every month and a half."
1,Stay away from this printer (Epson Stylus C64),"The first Epson printer I owned (The Color Stylus Pro) ran like a champ and it sipped ink. Based on that record, I bought the Epson C64 to replace the Epson Color Stylus Pro after it died 8 years later.The C64 lasted only two years before the black nozzled clogged up forever. And before that happened, the C64 used to run out of ink faster than I ran out of clean underwear. The print quality was decent, but it cost me a fortune in ink supplies. I paid more for ink supplies than I did for the printer."
2,Disposable printer?,"I purchased this printer because of it's separate ink cartridges, thinking it would save money in the long run. No such luck! If you change one cartridge, it goes thru the cleaning cycle and sucks another dry. Then if you don't use it for a while, you might as well throw it out, because you'll go thru a full set of cartridges trying to clear the clogged nozzle. And Epson just says 'take it to a service center' Cheaper to buy a new printer, just wish I had figured that out before blowing thru all that ink... Oh, and even when the cartridge is still half full, if the little counter chip says it's empty, you get to throw it out.This is the second Epson printer I've had die from this problem, so I'm not falling for the hype again."
1,Unreliable and Expensive,"I bought this printer 8 months ago. It worked well for the first few prints. After that, I used up about 80% of my first cartridge cleaning the print heads, which never seemed to work very well. Each head cleaning seems to use up about 5% of the ink in the cartridges. After the black cartridge ran out I spent $22 on a new one from Amazon, only to discover the printer had stopped printing entirely after installing it. I will never buy another Epson product after owning this."
1,Label Hell,"This printer seems to be incapable of printing labels (however I do accept that it may be possible that I have a faulty unit). The Label begins to feed, then the printer dog ears the corner and pulls the label off the backing and jams itself to death. This is using A4 Avery labels which have on other printers seemed infallible.It is a real shame as it can perform well if you only need to print a few photo's.Beware being tempted by the price of this unit, you may be better stepping up to a higher modem Epson."
1,Use it or Lose it,"The print quality on this model is good - BUT - the nozzles dry out quickly if you don't use it frequently. The solution is to use the ""clean print head"" function, but that sucks up considerable ink and you'll be heading to the office supply store soon. Like other reviewers have said, the ink costs almost as much as the printer."
1,You get what you pay for ...,"You get what you pay for ... a cheap and nasty printer. The black ink cartridges cost 25% of the value of the printer and last long enough to print a couple of letters.It takes forever to warm up, is slow and noisy, constantly nags you about ink levels, and mine eventually just started printing blank pages despite replacing the cartridge.I would never buy another Epson. I suggest you do the same."
5,Impressive!!,I love this marker in extra fine because you can write in a very small space. These industrial permanent markers are great for durability compared to regular ones. The ink stays on surfaces you usually can't write on.
3,Alcohol takes it right off,"These markers are okay, but I was hoping for a little more color-fastness. Even after the ink is dry for a long time, a bit of alcohol will instantly remove it from almost anything. It even makes the ink run on paper, the way a crayola would when you spilled water on it."
3,Great on some surfaces,"Somehow the word ""industrial"" made me think these markers would write on anything. That's marketing for you.I've found that these markers are great on some surfaces (especially plain ole paper), but I tried using them on some glossy padded envelopes and fliers and they just smeared on them -- strange, because my standard Sharpies work just fine on them.I probably wouldn't purchase these again because of the limited surface types that they work on, but if you're just looking for a sharp-point pen for matte surfaces (cardboard, etc.), you should be fine with these."
3,MOST CHILDREN DO is catatonicadelic,My favorite track is MOST CHILDREN DO. It's deeply introspective with a brilliant low-key trumpet part.
5,GREAT RITE OF SPRING!!!!,"I've had this recording for quite some time now since I got it off Itunes and Itunes AAC files do not do it any justice whatsoever, and it's not just me. the Itunes one's tracks are different volume levels and that is horrible for the louder tracks because the sound isn't as loud. I knew getting the actually hard CD would rid it of this. The horn section in the Rite of Spring recording is the MOST awesome loudest howling horn section I've ever heard and they play their parts perfectly, it sounds like someone is going to killed... not put on trial like most others i've heard. I have to yet hear Bernstein conducting it but I hear it's the best although I honestly don't see how it could get any better than this recording! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
3,Will we ever know?,"This book was captivating, easy reading, but yet confusing. It almost seems like a few of the ""badges"" were tainted, and that's why they stopped pressing to find out who paid Dial to kill Hogan. Could the warden's wife really have made ""almost identical"" calls? Or was it the same, maybe taped, message? There are too many unanswered questions. If Dial is still alive, I am sure of this; He has a copy of this book to add to his collection of his personal accompishments, and, He is an artist that is proud of his work, and he will surface again,with more of his creations, and stories to tell."
3,Pretty Good Non-fiction book,I used to live in Tulsa and knew of some of these people. Good research and good writing. I enjoyed it.
2,"Can't blame the author, really","The amount of information is thinly stretched out in this...thin book! The writing is good but the stories are recycled over and over and not much is discovered. Dial, to me, came off as a big B.S.er. I didn't find his philosophy or effette personality to be remotely interesting. Keep this book in a glass case---read only in the event of an emergency(nothing else to read!)"
3,More history than cookery,This cookbook leaves a lot to desired. It leaves out some of the most common variations on Turkish food and is a lot more historical information than necessary. It is an ode to the history of turkish cuisine but is not that useful in the cooking aspect of modern turkish favorites. It lacks basic cooking methods and does not inform people how things are eaten or accompanied.
1,failed after one year,"Failed after just one year. Car is a commuter and shopping car, so the part was not abused. Since it failed in the hydraulic portion, have to change entire part. Not happy."
2,Half good,"This band is considered, according to Wikipedia, as one of the founder bands of industrial music, and, since i have no better source as to who those bands might be, I trust Wikipedia. And this album indeed does delivers ONE classic industrial masterpiece, which is the first song on this album. However, the other songs are mostly off-putting, but interesting; hardly to be considered Industrial, but certainly experimental. I remember thoroughly disliking the third track, but it's one of the shortest ones on the album, and it grew on me a bit. Anyway, I wouldnt suggest buying this, really. It's incredibly short and mostly disappointing."
2,Good for what it is,"It's got some good cuts, but does it come anywhere near Forbidden Meat? Hell no. Forbidden Meat is and always will be one of the greatest punk rock records ever released. In this effort, Josh is the only original member, and he changed his singing style to sound more like Alkaline Trio. Again, I enjoyed a great number of the tracks on here, but I think Josh should personally stop trying his push his politics and start writing great music once again, instead of being an arrogant @$$hole."
2,Read Like a Boring Dream,"Although the hype on this book was very good, the only thing I can agree with is the statement, ""Dreamlike"", and a tedious, boring dream at that. It was so surreal and uneventful that I skimmed the last half, just to finish. Boring character development told in the third person."
1,Cheap Checkers,The cheapest produced board game I have ever seen. Only buy if you are taken it on a one way short trip that ends up on a waste facility. It will then be at home.
1,"very cheap quality, pooly made, made in China","The playing board is really flimsy, the checkers don't all stack properly. This is another product made by the same country that blessed us with lead, asbestos, and date-rape-drug poisoned toys. The Amazon Marketplace seller I bought this through was fine, but the product quality is low end China junk."
1,Not worth the cost,This checkers set was the biggest disappointment of anything I have ever ordered from Amazon. The checker board was warped and extremely flimsy. Checker pieces were also very light weight and cheap looking. The set is certainly not worth the cost. I would say that it might be worth $2-$3.
1,Don't buy this at ANY price!,"Yea, I agree with the other reviews...don't buy this. We purchased this at a small gift shop while on vacation. Everything was packaged and wrapped well (it didn't appear to be a returned product). However, we were dismayed to find that there was a shortage of red pieces, with 2 of them broken in half. The other strange thing is that there were 4 extra black pieces. Even if there were the right number of pieces and non broken, I still wouldn't recommend this set as it is extremely poor quality. As others have stated, the checkers don't stack well and the board is warped and doesn't lay flat.Thankfully, my 5 year old didn't care about all of this and still had fun learning to play (we had to be a bit creative due to the missing pieces), but we will be buying a better set and chalking this up to a learning experience."
4,It's Checkers,"Standard Checkers set with board and pieces that has been known by kids and families for years. Comes in a box that is not as sturdy as it needs to be for longevity, but with proper care, the board and pieces should last. Checkers is a great game for two to play."
1,Cheap and flimsey !,"Couldnt find a single medium quality checkers game on Amazon. this one : The Board is not stiff like other folding game boards; it is flimsy like laminated 'constuction paper' . the piece are fine,and the rules paper is too - they will out last the board."
1,junk,I sent this to a friend of mine and I was never so emabarrassed at what a flimsy board. I will have to find a REAL board now!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Checkers Board Game,Poorest quality I have even seen for a board game! Not even suitable for Dollar Store! Comes in flimsy box that will not last either! Amazon should not allow sellers to stock items of this quality!
4,Game is very playable,"Product is well worth the price paid for it. Is it as good as the ones from 40 years ago? No. But in today's world, it is very acceptable. The pieces are made of light plastic but they are stackable. The board is lightweight also, but very playably. You can spend more, but for the average player, this is fine.Pressman Toy Checkers Board Games"
2,Checker set,I was disappointed with the Checkers board and the checkers. They were much thinner than the previous set we have. The board and the checkers are much thinner but we were happy to find the set.
1,Missing pieces,"This item came sealed and when I opened it, it only had the black checker pieces. No red pieces, can't really play it until I find some red pieces."
5,Excellent Checker Board and Checkers.,Taught my granddaughter the rules of Checkers and ordered a Pressman Toy Checkers Board Games for my self and one for her to keep at her home where she can compete with her parents. We both enjoy playing the game.
1,cheaply made,I would not recommend this toy to anyone. The boards is basically like paper and wasnt even straight it was warped and i had to glue it to a piece of would to actually play.
3,The checker board was damaged.,"Though the checker board was damaged when it arrived, it was usable. I didnt want to go to all the trouble of returning it, but I'm reminded of the damage each time I play the game with my 6 year old granddaughther."
2,"Cheap, flimsy game","I don't recommend this product unless you want to spend your money on a cheap, flimsy game. I gave it to my granddaughter as a birthday present but then purchased another Checker game for her after birthday that was nicer and sturdier with better made pieces."
1,JUNK,NOT WORTH 25 CENT BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT WORTH A DIME THIS IS KIDS PAPER RECYCLE AND JUNK ON TOP OF JUNK
2,Cheep Checkers,"You get what you pay for. When you pay less for a product from china, than what it cost's to ship? don't expect to much in quality.This product was a gift to my child from a tite $ friend? and wasn't embarassed by it's poor quality?This product was made with child slave labor? How else could it be so cheep? In America we can pay more and get better quality.Stop being so tite, by looking for that GREAT STEAL that never realy comes around in the end. You get what you pay for from Amazon.com"
5,Good!!!!,I gave this product 5 stars and I'm glad to add it to my Gundam collection. Delivery was fast and it came brand new. I would recommend this to any Gundam or Mech series lovers.
3,not great. but not horrid.,"It was an okay album. A little too much mainstream punk-pop. Annoying high pitched man voices. I wasn't too fond of All-American Rejects. Nor was I to Cartel. I loved the remake of Time After Time. Not as great as the original. But still good.I was dissapointed that I Want You To Want me wasn't on the album though. It was a big part of the movie, and it not being on the album was dissapointing."
2,"""I Want You To Want Me"" ??????","My question is, where in the world is i want you to want me? i mean, its important enough in the movie to name the artist and have people sing it, it even played twice on the movie, but its not in the soundtrack?what gives?"
5,I Love Slug,"I am dying! This is the best book ever. My little boy loves it - but he's wearing it out. We found Brain Cell, but can't find the others in the series. If anybody knows where these books are - I will buy about 20 copies of each!"
1,Does not Fit Grand Vitara 2000,"I recently ordered this part, and found it will not fit a 2000 Grand Vitara as advertised, and have been trying to return it to the company for a refund. The company has not issued a RMA yet and it has been 2 months. Big hassle..."
1,winpy offering from imposter band,"I'm a huge Mighty Sphincter fan and I'm extremly dissipointed in this silly offering from a once great band. This release has only one original member. Doug Clark on guitar being the only original member has completly lost his edge. This release sounds thrown together and lacks the polish of earlier releases. This band should fold and rest on the laurels of its long since past glory days. This release would be better served as an aid in putting babies to sleep. It sounds like it was recorded on a boom box and mixed by small children. If you like cute little lullabys than this might be for you, however if you prefer your music with some content and presence you should steer clear of this incompetent recording. Count Chocula as Mr. Clark likes to be referred to is out of ideas."
2,flash malfunction,The wheel that turns the different colors for the flash broke after a week of having it. Which then defeats the purpose of the whole camera.
1,God...its already broken...,"It couldnt roll film, I left a massage to the seller but he didnt respond me, It frustrated me very much because I feel so upset that I ordered a broken lomo camera... I really need help to know how to fix my camera and how can I come through this situation. Where can I find a person who can solve the problem for me!!!"
1,No Good :0(,I always wanted to buy this machine.But it was a disappointment in time to see the photos.She has no differential photos to the light of day and night at times the flash is not triggered.Not when the picture comes out with the filter that you chose.I did not like and do not recommend.If you are looking for a fun buy the camera fisheye that you will not regret if
5,Maja is the Biz-Zom- Bomb,"When I lived in Spain, I loved dressing up in the evenings, and going out. But what topped it off was Maja perfume, it makes you feel and smell like Heaven. I love it."
3,Spark Screen for Firepit,This was the only replacement spark screen I could find. I like the height and the pivoting top. I am concerned about the light weight screening used.....will have to wait and see how it holds up.
2,"Good quality, but not true to the size stated","Item was stated as being 20 x 20 and is really 18 x 18 plus handle) It sinks into the pit more than I wanted... I've ordered the next size up which is stated as 26 x 26 and is probably 24 x 24 and will be a much better fit. Received the medium (774) Spark Screen and the sizing is as stated... go figure. It's a bit larger than what I wanted, but suits my needs much better than the small spark screen. Love having the ability to access the fire without having to lift off the entire screen. Good quality product!"
3,"Great quality, smaller than expected","This is a well constructed fire screen, heavier than most I have seen. The only negative thing that I can say is that it is smaller in diameter than stated, so I will have to have my fire ring modified to fit the screen."
3,"Nice screen serves the purpose, but not exceptional quality","I purchased my first screen in 2003. I'm ordering a replacement today because it fits my homemade firepit. I will tell you that if you plan on having roaring fires, the paint burns off the screen and it will rust very quickly. Someone let a fire get out of hand one night and the screen's never been the same. The screen puckered in places and began rusting. I've brushed the rust off and painted it at least 3 times, and recently discovered the screening has rusted away to nothing in 2 spots. Still, I like the concept of it and, again, it fits my pit perfectly and is the only one of its kind I've found. So, I'll pay the $100, get another 6-7 years use and then probably buy another one! Great quality? Not so much. But I was satisfied enough to buy a second one."

1,It was great until it broke,"Given, it had a hard life with my daughter on the road with Drum and Bugle corp. But it did the same thing as several people remarked about on several different models: it was working and then it broke for no reason. You think it's batteries, but with brand new batteries no go. I'm wondering if I should even buy another Advantix. This problem seems to cover more than one model."
3,Among The Better,This is surely among the better Rosenkavalier recordings. In its day it had no equal. Can Christa Ludwig ever do wrong? I don't think so. She is sublime as is Karajan. A young Nicolai Gedda is a treat. My problem is Stitch-Randall with that annoying vibrato.Schwarzkopf herself I find a bit too white and colorless. This great opera is widely recorded try them all. The most memorable performances I've seen were live from New York to Vienna.
5,Quick sick!,"Great reference for chokes, not for the weak at neck. It should be called ""10,000 and one ways to choke your opponent"". Brandon shows you more chokes than you will ever want to know. This DVD set is truly sick! A must have for your DVD collection."
3,efficient and well played but it left me cold,"In a previous review of the Brahms and Tchaikovsky violin concertos played by Nathan Milstein, I rated the recording very high. I especially enjoyed the Brahms. That Brahms recording had Anatole Fistoulari as the conductor. Here we have William Steinberg and the Pittsburgh Symphony. Although Steinberg is my favorite Brahms conductor, his performance here is just too efficient and cold for my taste. Milstein is also on the cold and efficient side. The Beethoven is very quick and to the point but has little warmth or poetry. I always wondered how both of these concertos could fit on one CD. Now I know, the music has to fly. That type of playing is simply not my cup of tea."
4,How Some Key U.S. Landmarks Rose from the Ground,"History invites its audience to go behind the scenes of some well-known monuments of the Continental United States to discover how they came into existence. Superb photography, nice drawings, meaningful archive newsreel footage, moving witness accounts, expert comments, and judicious computer animation bring to light some less well-known aspects of these landmarks. In summary, the DVD set under review is a nice pedagogical tool that will fall into the good graces of a broad audience."
5,This CD is the greatest!,"I'm so glad that Pound is finally starting to get the recognition they deserve. ""Same Old Life"" is a great album and Pound rocks the house in concert! It's cool that some of the band members went to the same high school I go to now and are making a name for Poughkeepsie! Keep on rockin' Pat, Jason, Jerry, and Sandy!"
5,Toad meets edwin,"Pound has managed to capture the outstanding lyrical content of Edwin Mccain and match it with the haunting melodies of Toad The Wet sprocket. The folk rock genre is not entirely gone when you realize that Pound is out there doing their thing. If you like Toad, Hootie, Edwin, CSN, or the Indigo girls you should listen to this disc."
2,Average CD,I came across this cd on accident and have been displeased by the music that I have heard on it. They sound like every other wanna-be Third Eye Blind Band. They don't rock hard enough to make up for a poor singer. Overall a terrible effort by just another band.
1,this is the worst cd i've purchased in years!!,"this cd has nothing to offer. The original singer was thrown out for reason of no talent. judging by the choice the band made, for a new singer was so horrible,that i returned the cd the day after purchase. Pat G. is one of the greatest guitarists I've ever heard. This record does nothing for him. Another great choice by the band and the record company. Oh-yeah, the band also sold out.""Pound"" used to be one of the HEAVIEST, and most talented bands in the New York area. Way to go!! My suggestion to POUND is ""Head to Alaska,I hear they need good bar bands in Anchorage!!"" Long live Corey DiGiovanni!!(the original frontman.)"
1,what the hell is everyone thinking?,"i cannot believe all the good reviews this cd is getting. did the band pay you or something? this album has to be the most generic unlistenable unoriganal cd i have ever had the misfortune of listening to!!! every song grates especially funky those lyrics have to be the most uninspired crap i have ever heard. ""feeling kind of funky today""? who the hell writes that? i picked up this album in a massive cd clearance sale for one dollar and i want a refund!!! the only reason i picked it was because i liked the name. now i hate the damn word. a four and a half star average. what the hell. where you all dropped on your heads when you were babies? or didn't your mothers love you enough? get a life!!! best moment while listening to this cd - pressing stop."
4,Pretty darn good,"Although the allusions to Matchbox 20 are not entirely unfounded, I think it's a little insulting to compare POUND to the former. A better comparison is to Our Lady Peace, whose lead singer is also a little on the odd-sounding side, and whose music has also recently undergone a taming of sorts. If you like alterno-pop with a heavier edge, you will not be disappointed with this CD. I don't know if it breaks any new ground, but most ""groundbreaking artists"" today flat out suck, so maybe it's good they stick with what works. This CD is definitely worth a spin, and don't be surprised if you hear their name for a while."
5,funky,"this album is nothing less than awesome. there is not one bad thing ican say, it is very consistant. these guys are true artists as well as musicians. everyone i have ever played the album for has loved it. i cant wait for their next one."
5,BAND OF THE CENTURY!,"POUND is the most awesome new band I have ever heard. Every single song on this album could be a #1 hit. From ""Upside down"" to ""My World"" to ""Hey Now"" they just simply kick major butt. And when I saw them live I couldn't believe how good they were.Everyone please call and request them on the your local radio station. I want Pound here to stay!"
5,Pepe Romero is an amazingly good guitarist!,"Listening to Pepe Romero play is a fantastic musical experience. Here we have a collection of various solo and three duo pieces performed with his brother Celin. Each piece illustrates Pepe's unique combination of abilities: incredible speed, intense emotional interpretation and unbeat technical skill. This is a collection pooled from other recordings but is very much worth owning! Buy it now!"
2,Very disappointed,"Pepe Romero is a fine guitarist, and I like his more recent recordings very much, especially his guitar concerto recordings. However, this CD is a disappointment. The main problem is the horrible recording quality; if you like a muffled, tin can, heavy reverb sound, this may not be a problem for you. And if you like a flamenco-influenced style more than the classical guitar style, then you might be satisfied with these recordings as well. I prefer, for example, Parkening's version of ""Rumores de la Caleta"" and Williams' performance of ""Leyenda."" These criticisms notwithstanding, Romero is still one of the best guitarists around. His performance of ""Fantasia para un Gentilhombre"" with Academy of St. Martin is one of my favorites."
3,"Nice selection, execution is a matter of taste.","Mr Romero has chosen a sound collection of Solo guitar pieces, although It seems that his foremost interest is to display his virtuoso prowess, which somewhat taints the fair. 'Romance' is played far too fast, even a beginning student would be chastised for this. Variations by Sor is also so fast it's silly, all the character of the piece is lost. This CD is very much a matter of taste, some of the pieces are wonderfully played, but I would prefer a more stylish approach."
3,Fully meeting the title,"I just finished the book on one sitting. Well written text on basics. Allthough author seems to have quite a bit of experience on SWATing I would have hoped for somewhat deeper look. Especially on rehersing a team and on a reallife planing. What kind of tacticts have proven to work etc.Book covers all the basics on planning and considering of a operation, but teamleader should be past all that basic information when starting to operate. Part dealing with the Chain of comand and operational aspects on command post was enlightening. Overall quite nice little book and well written. Somewhat deeper look on to the reallife tactics through examples would be appreciated."
3,Good for a beginner but too basic for experienced leaders,"I read the book cover to cover and didn't find too much that I didn't know already. The book did cover alot of basics that someone new to a SWAT environment would benefit from. It is a good ""refresher"" book for the SWAT leader."
1,Complete waste of money,This book is not applicable to American tactical law enforcement. It seems most of the book was copied straight out of U.S. Army field manuals. an utter waste of time and money.
3,Too basic for leadership title,"The author covered the basics very well, but it is very basic to have the word ""Leadership"" in the title. This book would be good for a new operator, but anyone with tactical experience should be looking for another book. Experienced tactical operators will find this book decent for review, but not much else."
5,Very Soothing Music!,"I was first introduced to this little-known CD by my aunt, and I immediately found it relaxing and otherworldly. We used track #3 (""Raindance"") in a silly video we made -- it worked great! Then I got the CD for my birthday. The whole album is very soothing and not too distracting. The music is filled with percussion and unusual instruments. The album mainly paints pictures of water, but sometimes it even sounds like ancient tribal rituals of some kind. Don't be fooled by the group's name -- they are from England I think, not Japan. The group has other albums as well, including 'Peyote' and 'Primitive,' both of which I'm sure are just as good as 'Undercurrents.' Although it can be pretty hard to find, I would recommend this CD to anyone really. I just love this CD!"
2,"disappointed, not as shown","I specifically bought these briefs for my son since he always wants to wear red. Not one of the pairs was as pictured. They were all different colors than as shown. I noticed on other websites, they show them in the colors that they sent me. Unfortunately, they don't let you return underwear, so I now have underwear that who knows if my son will ever wear."
5,"Moving, remembering, and being.","This is a wonderful book about a late 80s stereo repairman (Ray) who discovers that he can, through some kind of power of imagination and love of music, actually cause lost albums to come to be. A musical trip through the late 60s (The Beatles, The Doors, Brian Wilson) as Ray re-lives both his own youth and the time and character of the musicians who made the music which provided the soundtrack to a tumultuous era. In the present, Ray is dealing with the death of his distant father, the tenuous threads which hold his marriage together, and coming to terms and some form of understanding with both. Stefan Rudnicki's narration is (as always) rich and resonant, capturing's Ray's voice and grounding the book in a dry, gravelly bass which suits it perfectly. This is an authentic book of a time that was and of timeless music that almost was, and true human characters moving between them. I enthusiastically recommend it."
5,noahs ark soundtrack,i feel the music was moving and insperational. The music seem to have played along with the era. The newer music added a new twist to an old and well know story of our past
3,"Not Bad, but it Reveals Nothing New.","The Artful Dodger, one of the leading names in 2-step, has delivered a thoroughly listenable CD that otherwise brings nothing new to the genre's table. That's disappointing, for I expected these guys to come up with an album that would push UK garage to unseen territory. Instead, we get the same beats and basslines, along with a predictable lineup of vocalists, including Craig David who appears on a couple tracks. After a while, the disc threatens to get one dimensional, although the mellowed-out ""Think About Me,"" the dreamy ""Movin' Too Fast,"" and ""Re-wind"" aren't bad at all and give the disc some promise. But, ultimately, the verdict is this: pick up the Dodger's previous effort ""Re-Wind,"" which is a more consistent and satisfying disc. While casual listeners should consider ""It's All About the Stragglers,"" the more discriminating two-step guru is likely to gripe, ""been there, heard that."""
2,2 LINE SPEAKER PHONE,THE PHONE WORKS ABOUT AVERAGE EXCEPT FOR THE CALLER ID FEATURE WHICH IS PRACTICALLY USELESS. THE SCREEN ON WHICH THE NAME AND NUMBER OF THE CALLER IS DISPLAYED IS VERY SMALL AS IS THE PRINTING AND WHEN THE PHONE IS HUNG ON THE WALL IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO READ ANYTHING ON THE SCREEN WITHOUT BENDING DOWN ABOUT 12 INCHES BELOW THE PHONE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE IF YOU WANT TO HAVE CALLER ID.ROCKO
4,wonderfully entertaining,This story of a love/hate relationship between Madeline and Gabriel will keep you reading until you finish the book. I couldn't put it down. All the characters were fabulously developed and colorful and it was packed with more than enough action to satisfy. Christina Dodd paints such vivid pictures with her words that the reader is transported into the house party and feels involved in the entertainment and the intrigue. Beware the surprise ending. A lovely romance filled with twists and turns that will keep you tied up in learning and loving the characters. You will finish this book in one sitting and then read it all over again.
2,Boring Again,"Madelaine de Lacy, Duchess of Magnus has swapped places with her cousin Eleanor to be a lady's companion so that she can attend the Game of the Century to stop her father from gambling away the family's heirloom, the Queen's tiara. On arrival at Chalice Hall, she meets Gabriel Ansell, Lord Campion, the fiance that she deserted 4 years ago. Will Madelaine resist the charms of Gabriel and will they trust each other enough to stop the scam that is the Game of the Century?This is my second book by Christina Dodd and will probably be my last. I had trouble finishing the book and alsmost gave up half way through. The danger lurking in the background didn't really get off to a start and you could predict the ending. There was no chemistry between Gabriel and Madelaine except for one sex scene which was quite hot. Apart from this scene give the book a miss and read a book by other historical romantic authors who do a much better job.Lealing"
2,a disappointment for sure,"Parts of this book were what you would expect of Christina Dodd, but other parts seem like a graduate school writing assignment that went awry, especially the last dozen pages or so which seemed just slapped together, to the point where twice the hero is described as coming to the rescue riding bareback, and then ""slipping from the saddle"". This kind of editorial sloppiness just underscores the feeling that the book was pushed through production. Too bad, it could have been a good story!"
2,Blah...,"I am usually a huge fan of Christina Dodd's novels, but this one left me feeling bored. The magic that Dodd has created in her other novels was sorely missing in this one. The characters were boring and the plot was dumb. I felt like I never really got to know who the characters were. Although I want to know Eleanor and Mr. Knight's story, I think I will wait for it to hit the stands at the used book store. I hope this isn't a sign of Dodd's future works."
2,Such a disappointment...,"I always await Christina Dodd's books with great anticipation. For the first time I can say I was sorry that I even read one. The behavious of both of the main characters left a lot to be desired - but the repeated humiliation and put downs of Madeline by Gabriel and his manservant left a bad taste in the mouth. Not only did she accept everything at the hands of Gabriel - she accepted it as her due which came across as warped. Well - she wasn't perfect, but neither was his behaviour - yet somehow all of his atrocious behavious was ok because she LOOVED him. YUCK. Unlike other books by Christina Dodd there was no balance in this book at all. The ending seemed to be put together in haste, ending the story in a very unsatisfactory way. I would recommend giving this one a pass. I will think twice before rushing out to get the next in this series."
2,Not Up To Dodd's Par,"As a fervent fan of Christina Dodd, I was heartily disappointed with the pacing and storyline here.The plot points are a bit thin, and for the first time in my recollection, so are the characters. Maddie is stumbling around being pompous and self-righteous, refusing to use common sense logic in the listening to the reason's behind his gambling, much less bothering to take note that he's stopped... *Yawn*. The usual humor and candor of the characters was missing, and frankly, the love scenes were dry.But MOST of all, the abrupt ending was irritating, and though I can only assume that this is a launch to a sequel, I felt jilted at the end with relatively little closure of the situation/adventure.Read as if Ms. Dodd churned this out in an afternoon, leaving open threadlines, mistaken clues, and diluted dialogue. Boo.Still a fan to the end, but truly was disappointed in this unmemorable adventure."
2,Disappointed for the first time,"I have always loved Christina Dodd's books--until now. I couldn't really grow attached to any of the characters, the setting for the story was unpleasant, a lot of the pages were just fillers,(this could have easily been a short story instead of a book) and--to add insult to injury--it ends with a cliffhanger which will need to be resolved in the next book. The least Dodd could have done for a reader who struggled to get to the last page is to finish the book in a satisfying way. The only positive thing I can say is that the next book in the series HAS TO BE better."
2,What a disappointment!,"As a HUGE fan of Christina's books, I was very disappointed with this one. It was the first Christina Dodd book which took an effort to finish (usually I gobble them up in one sitting). All of the wit and charm of the ""Governess"" series was missing here. I found the main characters unlikeable (except perhaps to each other), and the plot line was ludicrous and unbelievable even by the standards of romance fiction. Like the reader above, I thought the quality of the editing was lacking as well. I actually checked the publishing date to see if it was perhaps a reissue of an early book, as the writing seemed very amateurish in comparison to her other books. On the plus side, the love scenes were fun to read, though it's not enough to allow me to recommend this book."
3,"Everybody called her ""your Grace"" but she wasn't a duchess yet","The heroine is the future duchess of Magnus, supposedly because Queen Elizabeth I decreed the firstborn child would inherit the title regardless of gender. Seems unlikely to me. Also she was always introduced to people as ""the Marchioness of Sheridan and the future duchess of Magnus"" - which doesn't seem proper, for the future title to be announced like that.It looked to me like the author was so enamoured of the idea for her heroine to be a duchess that she made up this ridiculous story of Elizabeth I and also says that everybody called her ""your Grace"" even though she hadn't inherited the title yet (her father was still alive) - but there isn't any explanation of why they would do that.Other than that, I enjoyed the story and the main characters. The constant mention of the heroine being a duchess (when she wasn't) was quite irritating and spoiled it for me though."
4,PLEASANTLY SURPRISED,I am not a huge fan normally of historical romances but this one I could not put it down. I read the other reviews and don't see the same issues. I only wanted to explore the Eleanor issue more and I found out that her story is coming in November. I will definitely read more Dodd stories and recommend them to my friends.
3,The stars are for Gabriel!!,"Christina Dodd is an automatic buy for me, but I have to say I was disappointed with this book. I just didn't like the heroine, Madeline. I never warmed up to her. She seemed spoiled and shrewish and I don't think she deserved the hero. Dodd's characters are usually so likable and really pull you into the book. I enjoyed all of her books that I have read, especially the anthology Once Upon a Pillow. I will read Dodd again and am looking forward to the next book with Eleanor and Mr. Knight. I just hope she is more likable than Madeline de Lacy!"
2,Is Dodd forgetting how to write?,"For some reason, I continue to buy Dodd's new books, even though lately her heros are so dark and brooding that they rival the villian in terms of who I dislike more. There was no romance between Gabriel and Maddie, only arguments and one very harsh sexual encounter. I never developed any sentiment for either of them, and the supporting characters were more annoying than supportive. Also, there didn't seem to be an editor for the book; the dialogue was choppy and there were many typos and grammatical errors that were very distracting. I sincerely doubt I'll buy Eleanor's story when it's released despite the fact that I own almost all Dodd's other works."
3,What Happened?,"I buy Christina's books on name only. I love her stories. She uses great humor and dialog. Big Sigh. I still love her stories and I will still buy her books on name only, but I was very disappointed in this one. I never liked the hero. I never felt the connection between the two characters. There was no getting to know them, no watching them get to know each other. Sure we know they had a past, but even the brief vignettes didn't capture or share the magic her characters normally express. And all this happened over a period of 3 days, just too unrealistic, even in a romance book. I'll buy the 2d book but I'm hoping the magic comes back."
3,NOT DODD!!!!!,"THIS BOOK WAS NOT DODD-LIKE!!! SHE USUALLY WRITES AWESOME BOOKS, BUT THIS ISN'T HER BEST. I DID NOT LIKE THE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS, BOTH WERE VERY ANNOYING. THE STORYLINE COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT, BUT FALLS FLAT. I DID LIKE THE ENDING, HOWEVER, AND CAN'T WAIT FOR THE TIMID ELEANOR'S STORY!"
5,The Gold standard,"Alicia de Larroccha is the gold standard for this repertoire and these particular recordings. which I originally came into contact with on the Epic label in 1965. are actually stereo Hispavox recordings. They have been released by the parent company EMI several times over the decades. This is the best set of digital transfers I know, clean, rich and colorful. No tape hiss. The instrument is first class, and the young Alicia was at the top of her game. She recorded this music once earlier in mono and twice afterwards, but this was the best; she was always elegant but here is the fire and the power that belied her size. Or to put it more succinctly, one of the top twenty piano recordings of the 20th century. It's a must-have."
1,Disappointed,"It was a very disappointing read, there's only one chapter on how to fight witchcraft and its only a few pages long, the rest of the chapters are on how to detect if someone is under the influence of witchcraft but from my perspective or at least what i got out of my read, it seems everyone around us is under the influence of witchcraft, my mother, my father, the clerk at the grocery store...ridiculous...for example do you have a friend that won't go home and takes up your time, there under the influence of witchcraft, that's ridiculous...or anyone who gets super spiritual with you when you try to have a normal conversation, there under the influence of witchcraft....total waste of my money... This book really concerned me...only because you might misinterpret general well being concern for ""witchcraft probing""..I definately do not recommend this book..."
4,Original High Energy,"Where did these guys come from? Are they related to David Bowie and/or David Byrne? Each time I listen I hear new angles and different aspects of the music. Somehow, through all the energy, I just smile listening to their output."
4,great music,"jorge meza music is something new for me and I'm really glad to have found a cd with amazon because I have been looking on some music stores in los angeles and they do not have them, good music"
5,Classical Guitar Concerto Symphonic Delight,"Heard for the first time Rodrigo's famous second movement of the Concierto de Aranquez on a CD compilation and had to learn more about this interesting piece.Learning about his blindness and his popularity made listening to the rest of the Concierto even more remarkable and enjoyable, as well as the other pieces are excellent as well, especially do I enjoy the Fantasia.Usual high performance levels of Sir Neville and the ACSTF. Wonderful addition to anyone's classic collection."
5,Rodrigo: Concierto de Aranjuez; Fantasía para un Gentilhombre,The cd arrived in perfect shape and the music quality was/is wonderful. The other selections were equally outstanding. I would/will buy other cd's this way.
3,Meh,"Flower arranging. Something that old ladies do, or so I thought. This book truly does have some incredible pieces that would be fun to make. Sadly I do not have the time to devote myself to the hobby. I have always found flower arranging to be a fun sounding hobby. This book was purchased because Marilyn Monroe had it and I have loved most of the other books that I have bought from her book list. This one sadly missed the mark. I was expecting to be captivated and instead found this book to be a bit of a bore. The arrangements all seem to be a bit dated. I will keep it for nostalgia but will not reference back to it. I would recommend this book if you have some experience with flower arranging or are willing to go buy the foam and wire required for most of the projects."
1,Sent me a damaged USED battery - No response to refund request,"I purchased a NEW battery from this company, but instead they sent me a USED battery with 37 charge cycles."
1,Used battery sent - beware!,"Beware, ""brilliant store"" sent me a visibily dinged up and pre-used battery instead of the new one promised. Waste of time and waste of money, not to mention bait and switch! RUN AWAY FROM THIS SELLER!"
4,Dad loved his gift!,"I bought this as a gift for my father, who loved the Rockford Files movies. This is the first 4 movies they made. He said they were great to see again, wish the remaining ones were on DVD but haven't seen them.Movies played just fine, & shipping was superfast for this item. Always have been pleased with Amazon."
2,"Great actors, but not up to the series","I agree with much already posted, here. I am an admitted fan of shows up to about 1980. After that, studios may have continued using film, but they began editing on super vhs tape. Also, and due to this and to save money, film copies were no longer sent to affiliates for broadcast. Super VHS tapes were. In short, these reunions, like so many other reunions and shows post the mid 80's, don't ""look"" as good or rich as the original ones. I also felt that they made Rockford too cranky, and less like the easy-going, likeable guy he was in early seasons. Finally, many a good Rockford's did not rely on fist fights. They didn't need them in these movies, as Garner's health made such fights seem implausible. I make all of these comments as a true fan of the original series, and of Garner and Margolin."
1,The Shaft Vol 1,"I couldn't agree more with the previous reviewer that this is just another shameful venture in order to milk the public out of as much money as the distributors can in order to get this product out. As fond as I am of the series (and the movies), I will not be buying these to supplement my series collection. I have an exhaustive collection and these additons just are not that necessary. Maybe someday I'll find them in a cheap used bin somewhere and buy them. Or wait until a ""Complete Movies"" volume shows up at a reasonable price."
5,Holds faithfully to the original brilliance,"These 4 movies were magnificent and recapture the spirit of the original show. Joe Santos is back as Dennis Becker, Stuart Margolin is back as Angel, Gretchen Corbett is back as Davenport. The Pontiac Firebird is back, so is the answering machine. Noah Beery died during the first film, he does not appear. Jim's trailer (now a ""double-wide"") is still sitting in Paradise Cove, across from the Sandcastle. The stories are well written, interesting, believable. The actors hold true to original character types. There were 8 movies total, I eagerly await the release of the final 4."
5,Rockford movies,"It was great seeing Rockford and Angel together again. Too bad Noah Beery, Jr., couldn't have been a part of it. In short, it still doesn't get any better than this."
2,Too weird,"This story starts out promising, but in the end it's not really worth the reading. I hated the way everything was turned into a metaphor. Can't we just enjoy a story for itself without it having a lot of different symbolic meanings (which don't really work anyway)? Overall the impression I came away from _Enchanter's Glass_ with was that it was just *very* weird, and I was disappointed the author didn't try harder, because there was potential for a great book."
5,Great! I loved it.,I really liked this book. Whitcher's writing really makes this story seem like it's really happening. I recomend this book to anyone who likes fantasy.
3,I don't smell bad,"Thats about it. Deodorant either works or it doesn't. I work out, run, and play soccer. Granted I am healthy individual (meaning that generally after a workout, I shower), I still have not smelled bad at times I shouldn't (after work, or a social event). So good job Old Sprice."
5,Pianophile,"I purchased the vinyl version of this disc many years ago after researching the available recordings and I considered it to be the definitive version of these works. I waited for years for this CD transfer and I was ecstatic when this disc was released in Europe so North American listeners now have an excellent opportunity. Brendel's interpretation of these works epitomizes the Romantic style of Robert Schumann. Though the execution of these pieces is carefully and tastefully judged, Brendel perfectly demonstrates the kaleidoscope of emotion in these exquisite works with an illusion of spontaneity rarely achieved in the recording studio. The passion and poetry of these pieces is arresting. I have heard many other versions of these works over the years but this disc remains the benchmark."
5,Gut wrenching licks with machine gun drumming!!!,An extremely good debut effort from one of Virginia's best death metal bands. A lot of good technical brutality with just enough speed and thrash flavor to make it a must have for 2007!!!
5,Great Book!,"A very detailed, yet easy to read, book regarding the Heloderms in North America. Using it as lunch time reading, so I have yet to finish it. But at about halfway through its a good book."
3,Disappointed,"I did not receive the book that I ordered.. I ordered ""The Merriam-Webster Crossword Puzzle Dictionary,Second Edition,"" copyright date 1997. The book that I received was ""The Merriam-Webster Crossword Puzzle Dictionary"" copyright date 1992. It does not have as much up to date information as the later edition. The book was in excellent condition, as advertised, but not the one I wanted. I was very disappointed because they told me the Second Edition was in stock.."
5,"Awesome book, beautiful artwork","A friend of mine preordered a copy from the manufacturer, I loved it so much I had to order my own. It's got a ton of info, who knew how many kinds of vampires are out there? Plus, it's worth it for the artwork alone. I'm tempted to tear out some of the color pages when I get my copy and hang them up, maybe I'll have to buy an extra copy!"
3,Interesting research! Great art!,"I was most pleased with seeing many of my friends and fellows listed in his book, but was somewhat surprised that I was never asked if he could include my name and my work. Nevertheless the book is a wonderful resourse guide and an enjoyable read."
4,An incomplete and meandering compendium with some good tracks,"This is a fairly solid effort from Mr. Pookie, with a number of great rappers adding their talents to some of the tracks such as C Fat, Lexxus, Big Cuc, Mr. Montis and Joy. There are also some outstanding female MCs in here, and I am impressed that he attempted the double album.Unlike Dallas Crooks, the remixes of some of his great tracks such as ""Stoney Crook"" are great, and actually add another dimension. The title track ""My Life"" is great also, but the album loses me a few times when he gets more tender talking about relationships.Still, a pretty solid album, and something that will add to the collection of any Mr. Pookie fan."
3,Crooked Album,"Mann, Mr. Lucci and Mr. Pookie go hard regardless, they music off the chain, but My Life ain't them. They ain't da same without them beats from Kevin A. They got they south style but on sumpthin' like a New York Beat. If I wanted to hear that, I move from Dallas to a damn Long Island or somethin. I hope ya'll boys come back with somethin southside, like a Texas Massacre 2003. Represent us well Misters."
1,i gave them this star just cause i like the first cds,manne Mr. pookie & mr.lucci mad me mad as hell when i heard this how can you make all those fire cd's at the start of your carrer and then just fall off like that. c'mon dog be real yawll didnt have long verses like yawll use too yawll changed the whole style yawll had. this might sound stupid but they dont rap about killing as much or robbing and thats who they are so dont buy this its a massacre.
5,Great,Arrived quickly. My son sketches a lot. I hate buying multi - packs to get one marker of a color he needs. Thanks
3,CappaDonna speaks,"Interesting documentary about CappaDonna. The interview segments he appears to be more himself than posturing for the camera which are fun moments. Nice interview with True Master about producing for Cappa. Though the audio is from the video camera mic, there are some concert clips from some solo and Wu-Tang shows that do a good job of capturing the energy at the show and more importantly, on stage. Def worth a pick-up at discount price."
2,DISAPPOINTING EFFORT,"Compared to other DVDs of this type, this one falls short of being satisfactory, It would benefit from better lighting (many scenes are too bright) and more imaginative poses."
2,Outdated overview,The editorial reviewer is a used car salesman....This book is an outdated...a better title would be Wireless 2002.
5,"Zesty, lively Gallic!","Having seen Roy Goodman conduct and being on the edge of my seat as he took the audience through an evening of French Baroque, I find this recording matches my experience of the concert hall! This is lively and full of zest and Gallic wit. Thoroughly enjoyable and will be listened to frequently. I only wish there was more!"
4,Phat party tunes!!,Came across this band while driving away from the city for a drinking weekend with a car full of dudes. The CD delivers on its party-beer vibe! Definitely check out the hidden track after the last song; it's your back to basics solid rap.
5,SHeDaisy... The Whole SHeBOMB,"I usually don't listen to Country but when I heard these ladies from Utah, I was totally hooked. Their music contains a little bit of everything. From Country, Pop, R&B, and Blues. Although I mostly listen to R&B, I just love this CD. This CD is a must to your collection. Keep up the great work Kristyn, Kelsi, and Kassidy. Much love, peace, and happiness... Jay's Jook Joint."
4,"Fun, well-written, great hooks...","but not country, which is fine with me. This is a great pop cd. Why do people have to turn this into a competition with the Dixie Chicks? Can't they both be great? Because they definitely are. I like both groups. There's room for more than one talented trio. SHeDAISY sounds great, and the writing on The Whole SHeBANG is excellent."
5,SHeDaisy was great,I am not much for country type music anymore but after hearing SHeDaisy on General Hospital I changed my mind. They are really great. Their sound is kinda western background with a pop swing anyhow really cool
2,This CD is too 'pop' sounding!,"The 2 singles released from this CD already are the best songs on it. That is always disappointing to me. I personally think SheDaisy sounds way too much like Wilson Phillips. If you want good female Country Music, try Jodee Messina and the Dixie Chicks."
1,Very Disappointed,"I bought this CD based on the song ""Little Goodbyes,"" which I love, and all of the good reviews I had read. It definitely doesn't live up to the hype. Most of the songs are forgettable. I rarely listen to this CD. I should have saved my money and just bought the ""Little Goodbyes"" single."
4,Pretty good stuff,"This is a good, fun album, in spite of the men whining and the country fans whining and the whoever whining. Not a great album, but a good album.No, they don't particularly sound like the Dixie Chicks - I like both, but the sound and the talent are different. No, they're not all sweetness and light. No, they don't sound like Loretta or Tammy. They sound like Shedaisy, and you'll either love them or you won't, just like all artists.My suggestion is, listen to the radio. If you like what you hear, you'll like the rest of the album. But don't buy it expecting to hear the Chicks, because you won't. And don't buy it expecting Patsy or traditional country, because it isn't. Just buy it because you like the music and enjoy the artists doing the music."
5,Wonderful cd!!,"This cd is SO great! Where usually there are songs that taper off after the more famous songs, this CD does not. From the first song, Little Goodbyes, to the last song, the songs keep you upbeat. Even the slower songs are wonderful and so full of emotion. Can't wait to hear their next album (soon I hope!)"
3,Crissy's Review,"This CD is an alright set. There weren't a whole lot of songs on there that I liked, but that is my personal opinion. It depends on what kind of music you like. It has all of their top songs on it. That's the only ones I liked."
4,"Great Songs, Annoying Video","I love their debut CD. I don't understand the comparisons made between SheDaisy and Dixie Chicks -- they don't look OR sound like them. The only similarity I can find is that they both have three women in their group. My only complaint is their video -- it's one long ""aren't we gorgeous"" commercial. Yes, you girls ARE gorgeous, but don't try so hard to prove that to us. Your ""Little Goodbyes"" video could've been a lot of fun to watch if it had instead illustrated the ideas in the song instead of putting you on display."
4,"Pretty good, considering they are new.","They SOUND a lot like the Dixie Chicks. The CD is good, although the songs start sounding the same. I think it's a pretty good first try."
1,This is not country music,"This group is pop; they are not country. It seems that there are about a dozen or so REAL country artists. I am so tired of the crap that is called country. I can't believe people like the garbage put out by this group, Bryan White, David Kersh, Mark Wills, and virtually everybody else."
2,Typical Country-Pop,"Little goodbyes was ok. But man, I would have rather downloaded that song from Napster than having to buy the whole album. I'm glad that other reviewers agree, and whether or not others like to hear it or not.. it IS true: Being in Nashville you see a lot of acts, and these gals DO have talent, but it sounds like a country-pop-Wilson Phillips meets Dixie Chicks. Can't they be original?? And what's with SheDaisy #1 stating they've been around longer? How does she know the Chicks weren't playing together before they hit the stores? Why should she even need to comment??? Anyway, it doesn't really matter what I say becuase their fans will love them despite the coat-tails they are riding on. My advice: Download some of their stuff on Napster or borrow it from a friend. This is one of those albums that I've really only found 1 or 2 good ones from, and I hear a LOT of counrty down here. Sorry Gals!"
2,"Not Country, Mostly Weak Lyrics, But Good Voices","I have read a lot of good reviews of this group but the songs pretty much sound alike and are not country. The harmonizing is good but gets old the more you listen. ""Little Good-Byes"" and ""A Night to Remember"" are good songs; however, others are too pop with silly and immature lyrics. I predict that many will not listen to this CD for very long unless they are a teenager."
3,Un-bias Review,"I liked their first single, Little Goodbyes, but from an un-bias standpoint, they DO sound A LOT like the Dixie Chicks. And, the Dixie Chicks DID make it big with their sound BEFORE SheDaisy (desite Daisy#1's review, who isn't even the lead singer). I feel they're just riding on the coat tails of the Dixie Chicks (who also play their own instruments)."
3,fun.. but only for a little while,I purchased these about a week ago and i already have them set up on the ceiling the only thing about them though is they dont get very bright unless they have been in the light for a while. and even after being in the light they are still a bit dim. i think once i get some lava lamps and other fun lamps it will compliment the stars but the stars by themself dont light up the room as much as i though they would. they stick to the ceiling very well i have only had one fall off.
3,"Not bad, not great","Certainly there were a lot of stars in this pack, and glow-n-the-dark stars and shapes are always fun. As far as education goes, it's really only as educational as you make it. It's not an inherently educational toy, so you would have to put the effort in to talking about stars, what they are. Maybe talking about constellations. Or you could use it to spell out names or words. Or just use the stars to make pictures, like a tree made of stars or what have you. I've definitely come across wall stars that glow brighter and longer, but these aren't aweful. The main reason I gave them 3 stars was b/c I was a little disappointed in their fainter light...after all, that's what they're all about--the glow. But they aren't horrible, just average"
1,Stars Do Not Glow...,I ordered these stars despite the mixed reviews because I was looking for large (not a choking hazard) stars for my two year old's bedroom as we transition him out of the crib. These stars do not glow. Do not buy.
1,Glow stars without the glow!,"Bought this for my son's nursery and after reading some of the reviews compared to other products, decided to give this a try. First of all, these stars have never glowed, even after leaving them in direct sunlight all day. I even left them in full glare of a lamp and still, no glow! The adhesive pads are very convenient, but after a few days, some of the stars started dropping off from the celing.Right now I'm in the process of removing the rest of these glow? stars!"
2,DIM,"These stars are pretty weak. They are very large so they are very noticeable during the day and when you turn out the lights they aren't very bright (and that's with a chandelier charge from the middle of the room!). I'd say they glow for all of 15 minutes. :PI found that the adhesive worked well, but there wasn't enough of it. I ran out and had to use some tacky stuff from my daughter's wall mount Aquadoodle. Both of my kids got the stars in their stockings, but I still haven't put them up in my son's room, because I was disappointed. I'm surprised they have such a decent rating."
3,what you get.,there are two star sizes in this jar. the vast majority are the smaller ones (about an inch tall) and about a dozen of them are the large stars (like you see outside the jar in the main photo. they come with enough double sided tape for all of them (works with my textured ceiling)
3,All out of stick,I think the starts are fine. They glow well however there aren't enough foam stickers to hang them all. With some creativity and scissors you can cut the portion that was meant to be discarded and use it to hang the remainder of the stars. The packaging is excessive and should be recycled or reused.
3,Not quite what I needed,"I ordered the stars to place in the grass for an outdoor wedding. They didn't glow bright enought for the effect I wanted. I gave the opened jar to my nephew, I'm sure he'll enjoy them in his room."
4,Lots of stars!,All these stars go a long way..but you will need more tacky stuff to put them all up. My son loves them.
5,The Grandkids love them!,"Not much to say here. They work, are currently being enjoyed and a bargin. Fun facor is high!"
2,Won't stick to a popcorn ceiling,"I bought these glow in the dark stars to put on my ceiling, above my bed, so my grandson could stare up and look at them at night, when he visits. I have a ""popcorn"" ceiling and these stars with their sticker adhesives won't stick. They will stick to the wall, but that's not where I wanted to place them."
5,it glow well,"this is a nice product compare with my another glow star pack form explor...brand, this is easy to use and super pretty at night, my rm gonna buy one too"
2,Do not glow much at all.,Don't affix to a wall. For an art project they are okay but they do not glow much at all. You will wish you wouldn't have put them on your ceiling.
1,Does not glow....at all,"I bought these for my 4 year old son's room. He was so excited so we put them up and kept the sun shining in on them, and kept his bedroom light in them for a few hours. Come bedtime, nothing. I even put the tip if the lamp straight on one and shut the light off. Nada. They are not what I was expecting at all."
3,Glowing stars,"I got these for my two year old son. It didn't take long to put up, in fact, he helped take the backs off the stickers that go on the stars. At first, he was excited, but he took a couple off the ceiling and broke one of the big ones in half. They don't glow for very long. If you are going to buy these for a little kid, I would buy a better toy that projects on the ceiling. There's that 50/50 chance the stars will glow, or they won't."
5,Great value for the price,"Got this to make a starry night over my toddlers bed and she loves it! Good amount of stars for the price. They glow for about 15 minutes, like other glow in the dark items and the sticky circles they include made the job quick and easy. They give one peel n stick dot for every star, so there is enough. Would reccommend."
3,Star Jar: Misc.,"So I have to say, I have mixed feelings about these. I love them so much and yet I have such a deep hatred for these things. They are wonderful because they are virtually unbreakable, they retain their shape, the glow quality stays with the item and doesn't fade over time and they can be truly educational. The reason these things are so hated is because of the sticky tack they give you to put these on your walls/ceiling. once they are on for more than a day, good luck getting them off unless you don't mind leaving residue from the tack or ripping off your paint in chips. These things are durable and stay stuck, sure, but what if you want to move them around or you just want to put them away for a while? Impossible without completely destroying your ceiling or walls. If you don't care about that, then more power to you and these things are fantastic. I would definitely purchase this product again but maybe look for a more reasonable sticking substance that is easily removable."
5,jar of stars is buckets of fun,We bought this to do my 5 year old's room in a space theme. He had a ball putting them up and enjoys his personal solar system!!
4,Jar of Stars - lots of fun!,"Bought 2 jars of stars, only needed 1 - plenty of stars in each jar. Kids love it."
2,there are better stars out there,not very thick and show the adhesive tape you hang them with....but if you dont mind that they glow well
4,Not a full gift on its own,"At my sister's request, I got this for my 4 year old nephew. He didn't seem to ""get it"" when he opened the gift, but she tells me that he loves having them all over his room. His slightly older brother got glow in the dark planets, and they've built a solar system in their room (which they use to play star wars). I think it is fun to have them up, but (in terms of opening a gift) I would get a little something else to go with it."
4,great quality for the low price,"The stars were fairly bright & hold their glow for a couple hours after about 30 mins exposure to fluorescent type lighting. Overall I was very satisfied with the quality of the stars in comparison to the low price. I purchased 2 jars & had more than enough to cover the ceiling of a 10x12 room. The adhesive dots that come with the stars doesn't hold well, so I would plan to buy some white sticky tack to put up the stars."
2,It's ok,"I had something like this when I was a kid and was very excited to get this for my 2 year olds room! There are a ton of stars and we didnt even use all of them!! The sticky 2 sided tape dots that come with it hold well and haven't fall yet, even on our uneven textured wall! But sadly they just don't glow well! I ""charged"" them for a good 3 hours and they were only visible for about 5-10 mon tops! I really wish they lasted longer but I'm sure it's just how this kinda stuff is."
4,Still glowing,After a year now and I'm happy along with my daughter... good purchase. She always asking if she in space after seeing them everynite before she goes to bed.
1,"The ""3 Keys"" book cover I like, but compared to the University of Michigan Library edition, buy that one instead","Rather than go over again HERE all the points I made about this Nabu Press edition of John Gray's wonderful 1890 book, please see my extensive, detailed side-by-side analysis of the book over at the University of Michigan Library's (UML's) release of this text. In short, I really like the ""3 Keys"" cover art that Nabu placed on ITS rendition of this most-excellent work -- and yes, I OWN this Nabu version IN ADDITION TO owning the UML copy, as well -- but for the very most part everything ELSE in the Nabu edition strongly inclines the reader to buy the UML publication, instead. Read my UML review and decide for yourself."
4,"Reproduction of a classic, with strange flaws","This text is a copy of the original 1890 classic, now in the public domain, on the production of very high voltages by static generating apparatus. Invaluable to the researcher and those interested in the physics of charge transference by friction and accumulation by induction, this reproduction is very legible except for more than a few pages scattered throughout that are entirely unreadable! A front piece disclaimer states that such defects may be present due to the fragility of the original copied document, or to the scanning process - a very curious warning. Fortunately, the entire completely legible book is available on-line from Google Books from which, given all appearances, this printed reproduction was made."
2,Stitching came apart,"Purchased this product based on the good reviews and the praise the Valeo brand gets from most sites. First of all, having padding everywhere does not mean having good padding. It actually makes it harder to grip when doing pull ups. After the third workout, the stitching in the palm as well as wrist wrap was coming off. Avoid these gloves, not worth the hype or the money."
2,There just ok,"I purchased these gloves after reading countless reviews stating that they were awesome. I figured for $20 it would be a bargain to get these gloves. After receiving them I have come to loathe their existence. There is very minimal padding on the spots that actually matter. The wrist straps are either too tight or too loose(not secure) and they dont flex well enough with the back of your hand. I have started having wrist issues after using them, my wrists feel like they are going to pop out of their sockets. Long story short I would definatly not recommend these to anyone and I myself will be buying a new pair of gloves in the near future."
2,Not much padding at the finger base,I bought these glves becasue i was getting callouses at the base of my fingers and to prevent the burning sensation on my fingers while doing dead lifts. Things I did not like about these gloves are:1. This glove advertises as 3/4 finger length but only covers up to the first knuckle.2. All the padding is in the center of the palm and none on the base of the finger.Things I liked about the gloves:1. The velcro wrist straps2. The mesh back that allows ventilationEven with the ventilation my hands were too sweaty so I bought some Gripads and they work much better. Plus I can move the Gripads up on my fingers for deadlifts and lower on my palms for bicep curls. Easier to take on and off. Much less sweating. Love the Gripads.
3,Not 3/4,"Just received this item, I agree with one other reviewer, this is not a 3/4 fingerless glove.A little disappointed. The quality seems to be less than the other valeo gloves, The fit seems OK. For the price, it's an OK lifting glove"
5,Great!!,Protects wrist and gives you good grip. Good material. Fair price and does it's job. Would recommend to any one.
3,Bulky,"Wrist straps are really not necessary for most lifting needs, although you have people who use them anyway. I was dissatisfied with this pair of gloves, they limit your range of motion in lifting and can jack with your form."
3,It's okay!,The product is okay... not the greatest but for the price is right.I guess you cant ask for much.
1,regular calidad,"esperaba algo de mejor mejor calidad, según la foto parecen ser un muy buen producto, pero es muy delgado el cuero parece papel, ademas las costuras se van rápido no recomendado"
1,Waooo !!,"I feel deceived, this brand has declined in quality, use it one day and it is broken, is of a material of cardboard and rubber. They stole my money, never come back to buy anything from this brand"
2,Unimpressed!,I've used these for a month now and already the stitching in the right glove is coming undone. I've used sheik which lasted me for 6 years and Harbinger for 4 years so it's definitely not me! I've been told valero isn't of good quality and now I'm a believer...go with a better brand name.
2,Falls Short,"I decided to try this product after a few goes withHARBINGER 140 Pro WristWrap Lifting Gloves. I received a recommendation for these gloves because they ""lasted a long time."" The Harbinger gloves do not (6 months max). I received these and while I don't know if they last longer, the quality isn't there compared with Harbinger's gloves. In short, the padding is inadequate, the palm leather is too slick and doesn't aid in grip, and the glove just appears a bit cheap. It is definitely inferior for serious gym goers. While it is better than going bare-handed, and the wrist wraps are adequate, don't try to save yourself some money, just go with a more expensive and better quality glove."
3,"Good Price, Cheaply made!","I guess you get what you pay for. I paid about 10 bucks for these gloves. I have been lifting weights for a while now so I have had several pairs of gloves. I looked at these because the price was great. It seemed liked a great value. Once I received them I realized why that was the price. The stitching was cheap and it looks like some thread is coming off. There is also little padding. And the leather is pretty cheap. The gloves are true to size. Overall, I am not angry at the purchase but just disappointed. Next time I will spring for the harbingers. I had those last time but they seemed a little expensive but I know why. You definitely get what you pay for. If lifting is not really your thing, they are probably great for you. If you need the padding and durability because you are lifting some serious weights, I would suggest elsewhere."
1,Made in Pakistan! Total Junk! Disappointed,"Made in Pakistan! Total junk, I'd rather have them from China! Valeo used to make good quality lifting gloves, 4-5 years ago. I had purchased 10 pairs back then because I liked the Pro Lifting Series Gloves. But sorry these new one's are total junk and there made in Pakistan!!! The package also says 2010. Look else where!"
2,Not as expected,"The wrist wrap is not elastic, the gloves bleeded the first day, very uncomfortable when using on pulling cable machine."
3,quality X price!,"this gloves arent the best quality around, but for the price it worth it... they are doing its job, and a good one. this gloves arent for pro`s hardcorelifters but for all the begginerss, intermedim this will work for some years!"
3,ripping problem.,"not only me but i checked a couple responses and they say that the gloves ripped verry fast, i bought them at modells and that is why i could return them but the problem is they are made somewhat cheaply, they work find unless u plan on punching things with them like me. then uhh dont get them. god for lifting not for punching just some advice."
1,bought that and received another thing,"I bought this last month and what i got was an scarecrow dress. I know Halloween is at the end of this month, but i want my gloves or my money back, not a dress to something that isnt even celebrated in my country. Cuz this is the other problem, sending back the dress would cost me almost the same that buy the gloves since i Live in a Caribbean Island."
2,"came apart, turn hands black",Decent gloves while they held together. These gloves only lasted 7 months. And for most of those months turn my hands black. Washing the gloves did not help.
2,Finger area is torn in several spots,"When I first got these I wasn't quite sure how they would hold up since they didn't feel or look that durable but I gave it a chance and sure enough, where my other gloves lasted 2 years these things won't make it 3 months!"
1,Dont Do It,I haven't had the glove for more than 60 days and they are falling apart. The stitching is falling apart and the Velcro is falling off.
3,Avgerage at best,Good hook/loop strap on the top of hand for secure fit.Good wrist support. Stitching started to come loose though.Hardly any padding on the fingers/palm. Expect callouses to develop.2.5 stars.I got the Harbinger 1250 gloves for heavy wrist support & the Harbinger 1260 for light training. Both are better than the Valeo gloves.
4,nice gloves,"These are nice gloves. I also got the Ocelot gloves from Valeo from Amazon for about $1 more and they are nicer with more padding, but they took forever to come and these arrived in a day. But I have no complaints these do a great job too."
1,Unraveled too soon!,"The gloves were comfortable. However, the seaming along the fingers came apart within two weeks and less than 5 uses. Unless you only plan to use these gloves for a week or less, invest your money in a different pair. They were a very big disappointment to me."
3,Okay gloves,The leather is very slippery so it's hard to get a good grip. Do not use them anymore. Have the Ocelot gloves now and I love them.
5,Five stars doesn't do it!,"It seems that this ""classic"" has been a definitive recording since music was first composed. In addition to the singing and conducting, it is the sound that emi has brought to bear in this ""recording of the century"" series that is as equally amazing. I own the Boehm and Karajan recordings also of this masterpiece and I hope I don't get sent to a desert island. But I personally think that Flagstad is ""the"" Isolde. It is doubtful that her opulent sound has an equal in this role. Although I think Eaglen had her impressive momens in the recent Met and Chicago Lyric series of ""Tristans"". If this Tristan is not on your shelf [presuming you are a Wagner enthusiast ] you have a deprived and neglected opera collection. Own and enjoy this immortal treasure from Walhalla."
5,THE GREATEST RECORDING OF TRISTAN UND ISOLDE!,"I'm sure this recording of Tristan will never be surpassed. The voice of Kirsten Flagstad is perfect for this role she sang a few hundred times at the Met. She is powerful, delicate and sensuous all through the opera. Her rounded tone is unique, her refinement in phrasing is amazing! Suthaus is a very good Tristan, second only to Max Lorenz. There's no need to say that Furtwängler conducting is absolutely astonishing in Wagner.My second favorite recording of Tristan is the live one conducted by Böhm in Bayreuth, with Nilsson, Windgassen an Ludwig."
4,Great reel!,"This reel had so many positive reviews that I decided to give it a go. I've now owned it for over a year and it has held up perfectly. The construction is solid, and the drag is silky smooth. It is a bit heavy but it's steel, so that shouldn't come as a surprise. My only complaint is that there is no line holder when I have it off of the rod, hence the 4 stars."
4,Rambo,I just have this for a short while but it has already proved to be an excellent reel. Smooth working. I also tried for jigging and it stood the test.
5,Penn 300 yard 30 pound reel,"This reel is a pleasure to use. When l have alot of line to take in, I realize just how nice it is. Nice long crank handle with a knob that fills your hand. The drag is easy to get that fine adjustment that we all want in a reel. It is not a fancy reel, but it is a reel that works really well."
5,Excellent read!,"I think the Romantic Times BOOKclub review says it all about A Season for Love. It classified it as a compelling page turner: ""...this is a wonderful read. The storytelling alone captured my attention right from the start."" What I loved about it was that it wasn't a boring run-of-the-mill traditional love story - it was a sensitive story of two families and how they manage to blend together despite the many pitfalls they faced. I can't wait to read Bancroft's next book!"
3,not so good,"This is not a review. Just a rating, it is three stars at 99 cents. You get what you pay for here. a short novel with a poor plot and uninteresting characters but it is not a total waste of 99 cents. cheap yes, good not so much"
3,This is not a Georgette Heyer,"Nice, cute little story.....but without the depth and feel of a real Regency Romance....characters were fairly well rounded but lacked the essential ""something"" that makes a book special....would I recommend it? Don't know...there were parts that were very good but most of the book was mediocre."
3,Complicated scenerio but cute romance,"This was fun but had pseudo-incest storyline. This is where things got complicated because the Duke is the father of a girl who falls in love with the brother of the Duke's new wife, otherwise her step-uncle. They are not related by blood, but I admit that it is a bit dodgy. The story was interesting and flowed with historical romance language.It was well written and I generally enjoyed the characters although this was a very vanilla romance."
4,"""Stone Cold"" to the rescue","I actually bought this movie for my husband, who is a wrestling fan. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it as much as I did.I have seen ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin in other movies he has made such asTactical Force(BOO) andHunt To Kill(better) but ""Damage"" is the best to date. It shows off his fighting, rough tough side but also has a tearjerker understory.This one was worth watching with hubby. I enjoyed it.NOTE: It is a fighting movie so there is blood and violence (in case you thought Austin was going to be a cream puff in this movie). He's not."
4,Stone Cold Damage,"When I checked out Damage, I was still reeling from Austin's flop, ""The Stranger"" - and was understandably skeptical. However, after watching the movie, I was rather pleased. Although his acting is not in the same league as The Rock, it's better than it was before. Also, the combat in these movies, although no Blood Fist equal, is solid and hard-hitting. Austin doesn't just mow over the guys (and does face some pretty decent fighters), but does finish his fights strong. His finisher is a powerful punch to the heart, but he doesn't overdo it (meaning they don't build the last-half of each fight around it), and he takes just as much damage as the other guy, driving home the fact that he can kick ass but is human.Lastly, the story is pretty decent and the backgrounds of the two supporting characters makes for an intersting addition to the movie. In all, it is a great rental and, if you like brawlers, would make a good addition to your movie library."
5,Great Movie,I loved the movie but anything with Steve Austin is wonderful. I watched him as a wrester and now as an actor and he is just so awesome. The movie was full of surprises and it had a great end.
2,Name dropper,"I knew, as everyone knows, that Bob Hope was famous and also knew, as everyone knows, that he knew a lot of famous people but this book is like Golf Digest's ""Top 100 Golf Courses You'll Never Play"". Apparently Bob didn't know anyone unimportant."
2,Not so great,"I bought this for my daughter 2 years ago. The sequins began falling off the shoes immediately. The shoes are also very narrow, so if your kid's feet are even a little wide (my little girl wears regular-width shoes) they'll be snug. The items are itchy and not very attractive. My little girl will occasionally play with the clothes from this set, but never wears them long because of the itch factor."
1,Not as good as the old model.,"Not like the one from 1960 that still does good and sturdy service on my Mother's desk. This new model is made with thinner steel and although copied very well it does not hold a good firm shape. The top corners can split if not handled with care or shipped without enough packing materials. Too bad, I will have to make one out of wood or find an old one at a garage sale. The supplier was very responsive and refunded my money, I would order from them again."
1,"Lousy quality, lofty price","Thought this box would be a better item due to the price. Kind of spendy for the cheap and shoddy workmanship. The lid feels like it was made for a box at least a 1/4 inch wider and longer, falls down over the sides, and was already scuffed and damaged right out of the box. The lid is fitted so sloppily that it can be moved back and forth side to side over 1 inch. Made from a cheap sheet metal, paint isn't sticking well.I don't mean to bash Chinese manufacturing, but come on guys, this is ridiculous. Pay a cheap price, get lousy quality. Upgrade and pay more and it shows up lousy, still made in China. Save your money, take a good stiff shoebox, make a hinge across the back from a piece of duct tape, and you will have a better box than this one.Back she goes to the vendor...have to vote with my wallet and quit putting up with this junk!"
2,Nice Looking but Inferior Quality,The product is poorly made although it is nice looking. The hinges don't feel like they would hold up with constant use. If you press on the top of the box it moves to the right which shouldn't happen because it is metal. The interior is too narrow to file index cards with ease. It should be a little wider. I returned it which is a shame because it matched my desk accessories.
2,Lid didn't close properly,This would have been a nice card file box if the lid would have closed properly. I don't think it was damaged from shipping because the outer and inner boxes were not damaged at all. I had to return the product!
5,Perfect for my 18-month old,"Based on the positive reviews I read at Amazon.com, I bought this book and several others to help prepare my toddler for the arrival of our new baby. She got the book when she was 12 months old and it is still a favorite 6 months later. While I agree with other reviewers that this might not be the right book for an older child, I think the appealing illustrations and the simple, repetitive text are perfect for younger toddlers. In fact, it is unquestionably the best book I've seen on the subject for this age group."
3,Too basic for my 2 1/2 year old,"This book does have beautiful illustrations, although very ethnic. The book is, however, far more simple than I would have expected having read the reviews that were posted here. My 2 1/2 year old daughter was very bored with this book - she wanted to know what the baby will be like once it's born - why does it cry? what does a baby do? what is my role now? This book would be best suited for a younger child - perhaps 1 - 1 1/2 years old. ...."
2,ah ok book,"hubby doesnt like it and my son doesnt as for it. Get ""what baby needs"" instead published by the sears library, that is a better book."
5,great book for my 15 month old,"This book is great! Very simple, sweet text and wonderful pictures for my 15 month old. He was immediately drawn to this book and asks us to read it to him often. I love that the book shows the new baby breastfeeding and the older child hanging out with the breastfeeding baby & mom. My son and I are still breastfeeding and plan to continue when the new baby arrives so instilling the idea that he'll need to share ""mama juice"" is super important to us. I definatley recommend this book! My only wish is that it was a board book as my son is in a ripping paper stage."
3,Not what I wanted,"This book is fine. It is for very young toddlers. However it came up when I search for homebirths, so I expected something totally different. I wanted a book about homebirth, not a regular sibling birth. I will say it is more positive than some of the sibling books I have seen."
5,Review from Books That Heal Kids,"Caring for a baby is a constant. They have routines and schedules that change the dynamics of a family. We Have a Baby uses simple text to explore all the things baby needs. ""A baby to feed....A baby to dress....A baby to carry."" An older sibling (probably under 4 or 5) would benefit from reading this and brainstorming all of the things baby needs - and how they can participate in baby's routine."
5,Great book for those expecting another baby,"My daughter loves this book. The children look gender neutral so we've inserted all of our names as the characters in the book. Hopefully, she'll be just as excited to finally meet and love her little brother as she is about reading this book."
4,I Just Discovered Wesla Whitfield,"After reading about Wesla Whitfield in ""O"" Magazine, I was drawn to her and bought ""In My Life"" last year (2005). I am a singer myself and am always interested in hearing new (to me) voices. Well, I was not disappointed (mostly) and love her renditions of many of my old favorites. I frequently listen to her CD in my car and use it to warm up my voice. My one criticism is the over-pronunciation of such words that end phrases like ""love"" which comes across as ""luvah"" (with the emphasis on the ""v"" and ""h"" at the end) and ""dreams"" which she pronounces ""dreamzh."" I also found ""Where is Love"" to be lovely and poignant except the long, drawn out, jerky pronunciation of ""Wher er er er is love."" That word (""where"") should flow seamlessly. Will I buy more of Wesla's recordings? YES!"
5,Excellent garden tools,These are high quality garden tools at a great price. Replaced some old tools that were flimsy and always bending. These are far superior.
1,Poor quality,"Within several days, the sleeves came apart. I stapled them to prevent them from completely separating. Don't buy this product."
3,Deadly arson,"This is a strange, dry little mystery where the reader never seems to get to know the main character, Detective Inspector Fusil of Fortrow CID. After an obvious case of arson, the CID recieve what is literally a ransom note, demanding money and threatening more arson if the demands are not met. While the Police and Fire Department heads are dickering about whether or not the threat is genuine and just which department will have to pay, another fire is lit, this time taking the life of a small boy. A note is recieved demanding four million pounds and saying that the price would double each time a demand was ignored. DI Fusil is constantly at loggerheads with his superior officer (why do ALL of the ""superior officers"" in detective fiction seem to be such dills?) over methods and whether or not to go exactly by the book. The crime is solved but so abruptly that I still don't know who was the mastermind as it's not mentioned!"
2,Disappointing and so-o-o-o long-winded...,"Having read all this author's prior books, which I loved, I just couldn't wait to sit down with this one. All I can say is how disappointed I was, especially since I had read the prior reviews. The plot was surprisingly unoriginal, as were all the characters---and it just went on and on and on...One thing I will say in its favor-the culprit remained a surprise until the end (which I thankfully arrived at eventually) and although the culprit was one of three I had selected, it was still somewhat satisfying.I will try this author's next endeavor, however, it will most definitely be courtesy of the public library...Susan"
4,Good but....,"Ex reverend Noah Gibson is released from prison where he spent five years for vehicular homicide when two people were killed while he was driving drunk. Noah returns to his family home where his ex wife Rachel lives with her four year old daughter. Shortly after his release grisly murders begin with bible verses left of the victims sins and Noah become a suspect.Problems I had:*Rachel had lived in the town most of her life. Yet no one questioned Mallory's parentage during or after her pregnancy?*What happened to Noah and Rachel's sons was never really explained nor was Noah's crime.*Since when is a 59 year old woman an ""old lady""?Biggest problem? Editing was TERRIBLE! Wrong punctuation, words omitted or repeated, wrong names. Ex: Cora for Alice or Rachel for Mallory. I had the same problem with Hunter Morgan's ""The Other Twin"". And with MANY other books. I truly must look for work as a proof reader as no one else seems to be doing it!"
3,OK and reasonable priced,"This is a reasonably priced book of cases, but some of the treatments suggested are really not used commonly (for ex. asthma mtretaments described). Good short cases, with photoraphs that one can use to test themselves and read on some interesting scenarios."
4,"Evangelion, as it Should Be",This is #2 in the reissues of Evangelion. There's no additional content if you already bought the original DVD's. The film transfers and Dolby 5.1 Audio are excellent as usual. The commentaries were the best part of the DVD. I love listening to the staff and cast talk about the feelings and opinions of what they did. For the price the episodes per disk on the Platinum Collection are great. Sadly there aren't any extra trinkets like the NERV parking sticker in the Neon Genesis Evangelion - Platinum Collection 1. Buy it if you've never owned or seen Evangelion. This is an anime that every fan should watch.
5,it's getting better,"when I watched the first eva dvd I was a little dissapointed.....I thought the show was vastly overrated,but it held my interest enogh to get me to buy #2 and im glad I did...the show is getting better and better (I heard it REALLY picks up later in the series)my favorite moment of this dvd is in the last episode ""magma diver"" it involves a hot spring a bottle of shampoo and thermal expansion....thats all im gonna say"
4,its good,ok this is a great anime the evas are cool being a teenage piolet what could go rong it is a good anime fun to watch i hope u like it if u buy it if u dont ur missing out on a good anime
5,Best anime series ever,"This review applies to the whole entire series, not just this disk. Never before has any anime, or even movie enthralled and move me as much as this. The direction is fantastic and the some of the characters will make your heart ache. If you are a fan of anime you OWE it to yourself to watch this. Asuka is personally my favourite as the fiery redhead who uses agressive and intimidation to hide her vulnerable self."
2,painfully annoying.,"although this cd has recieved its fair share share of radio air-space, it is still poor. I am always stunned at how people can put up with the vocals, the blokes voice is hideous. The band is also poor live. All in all a sub standard cd and generally over rated."
5,Top notch Aussie rock.,"On a recent trip to Australia, I heard Jebediah's ""Leaving Home"" on the radio and totally dug the song. I picked up ""Slightly Odway"" before I left and damn, am I satisfied! This album is incredible. It's one of those albums that you can listen to the whole way through but there are definitely some tracks that stand head and shoulders above the rest. Try ""Military Strongmen"", ""Harpoon"", ""Puckdefender"" and the aforementioned ""Leaving Home"". Not worth the expenses of a trip to Australia to pick up this CD, but close! Rock on Jebediah!"
3,So-so quality,"It's cheap, so don't expect anything magnificent. The only complaint I've got is that it took about 30 minutes to get the hair to part even remotely like it's shown in the picture. Flat storage in a little bag for months/years like I'm sure it was stored flattened the fibers out too much. Other than that - good coverage over my existing short hair and it didn't get itchy."
4,One Of The Best Teen Murder Mysteries!!!,"I watched this movie some months back and was searching online 2 see if its on dvd! but i found amazon had it and man thats a little bit 2 much for a used dvd!!But great story, great actor, Ms. Ali WAS SUPERB! any teen who loves a good murder mystery wud loove this!4/5"
2,Expected better song selection,There are two or three good songs in this album. I expected more for a Best of Gregory issacsn album.
2,Who the heck is Marsha?,"Grease is one of my favorite movies and I have seen it many times but the book was disappointing and had unfamiliar characters like Sonny's girlfriend Marsha, Sonny didn't have a girlfriend in the movie but I remember him liking Marty and wanting her to dance with him at the dance contest and getting mad when she threw him over for Vince Fontaine, but the main reason I didn't like the book was that I found it a bit dull and it was hard not to compare it to the fantastic movie but that's just my personal opinion."
4,Grease,"I liked this book because it relates to teenagers in school. It included romance, humor, and friendship. My favorite part was when Sandy and Danny met each other again after the summer. It made me realize how the world is so small and we can run into people in the strangest places."
2,A bit of a disappointment,"I have read all of the books in this series prior to reading Sold Out. I enjoyed the series immensely and would have recommended the books to any teenager; however, after reading Sold Out, my opinion has changed. Chloe's initial character was appealing because of her harder edge and atypical image. Unfornunately, as I read the book, I felt as though I was not reading the words of a teenager. The slang was dated, including words such as ""groovy"" and ""pretty tough chick"" as if these are typical of today's teenagers. Casual conversation throughout the story was far too structured to be that of teenage lunchtime banter, making the story seem spurious. Also, the issues in this book were either exaggerated or trivial. Few issues that Chloe faced were relatable to teenagers today. The book was trite, dated, melodramatic, and mawkishly sentimental."
5,The 2nd book in the Chloe series,"After accepting the Lord Jesus into her heart. Chloe Miller begins to face many challenges in life. One of the biggest challenges is her music. I very impressed with Chloe. Laura who is their base player is forbidden by her priest to play in the band Redemption. He think their music worships Satan. He also thinks that Chloe's church is teaching false doctrine. And he feels that the music Chloe writes should be all about God and not of the problems that everyone faces. So Laura is in a situation and does not know what to do. So the band has to find another bass player. Does Chloe have enough bravery to stand up to Laura's priest. Does Redemption still go on. This is when the Chloe, Laura and Ally face celebrity life. Will they get signed or will they die down and just be another garage band.I loved reading this book and I can't wait until the third one."
4,Ita's Life,"It is difficult to try and write about someone ten plus years after the person has passed away.In this book we have the life of a saintly person who gave up her status in the community and a budding secular professional career to devote full time to the service of the poor.The book takes into account Sis. Fords's life ....and does it in a straight forward non emotional leaning manner. If Prof. Z. had more data, to work with,at the time...I am sure she would have a book double the size. AS I now understand, the professor is presently working on another book on the subject.The question 'why did she (I.F.) believe so strongly in helping the poor' that she gave up her life in their service. I knew Sis. Ford, briefly while in college, and can atest to the accuracy of the data presented.Recommended for anyone who would like to be inspired by a down to earth soul who truly believed in the goodness of man...and ultimately, paid the servere price for these beliefs."
3,Very good for someone his age,"There are some good qualities in this guys playing though at times works sounded 'fake' as if he were playing things because he was told to do so and therefore occasionally did not sound natural. Perhaps at such a young age this is not always possible.The piano player whom I think is some relation to him was disappointing. In fact, many highly established musicians and colleague's of mine after listening to it have commented on this pianist saying it has ruined the overall CD by its colorless, dull and lifeless playing with an obvious lack of musicianship like a digital machine. I do however think this violinist will mature into something bright. Let's hope he doesn't use that piano player..."
2,comical overtones but with fairly solid music,"a somewhat poor follow-up to the great ""Upcoming Terror"" album. ok so the music is decent enough overall (even with the surf-rock cover song), but the lyrics are just unfocused and not very metal-minded. ""Junk Food"" ? why would a serious thrash band write a song about junk food? Well because they weren't serious. In similar vein to the band Tankard who started out strong, just went in a more comical approach to their thrash...not bad, but not as strong as the debut."
4,Good German Thrash from back in the day!,"This is probably still obscure today but back in 1989 I bought this tape (i should say mommy did) and I loved it! Fast, aggressive, and good mosh riffs! Gang shouts to boot also! This should be considered a classic in the realm of German Thrash but I guess its not. I was able to find this on CD for $15 used last year on eBay and I'm glad I still own it as I see people are willing to spend a pretty penny on this album! Its a good album for sure and for any collector the latest price of $40 is reasonable. Wouldn't spend more than that. Good stuff if you like Sodom with more ""lively"" vocals and bay area!"
5,Great handheld force meter,"Had an earlier model and it got misplaced - had to get another. Very convenient for quick or flexible lab and benchtop testing, for either tension or compression. Nice peak force feature."
1,Dissappointing,"Once downloaded and listened to, we realized this seems to be a rip off. All the songs are short, very short. None seem to be full songs. Look at the length of time on each song and don't waste yr money on this one."
3,Not What I Expected,"When I saw all the press play these cats were getting, I was sure this album would be way past cool. Unfortunately, my expectations were set on rock that kicks wildly into the air and roll that makes me run my head in circles. This music isn't bad, but it was just far too slow and rumbly for me. If you're looking for some vintage teenaged chill music with friends around, smoking the inevitable teenaged hookah, it's worth a shot."
3,B-Movie Fun,"LIVE GIRLS is a 1987 novel that many people consider a minor horror masterpiece. I'm not so sure about that, but it's an enjoyable read.The story takes place in New York City during the mid-1980s, when Times Square was dominated by junkies and the sex industry. LIVE GIRLS begins with the concept that the area serves a breeding ground for vampires, which is an interesting idea. Needless to say, the sex and violence in this book is quite graphic, and squeamish readers should stay away.I enjoyed this book, which kind of resembles a B-horror movie you might catch on cable at two in the morning. It's good naughty fun, and undeniably exciting in parts. The prose is kind of pedestrian, and many of the characters are almost embarrassingly two-dimensional. But the plot has an undeniable momentum, and I finished LIVE GIRLS in a few sittings. This is a fun read that horror fans should enjoy."
4,very good,i bought this book for my friend it's very nice and very cheap she loved it the problem is very slow shipping 21 days
4,Need met,I was satisfied with the CD as I needed a copy quickly to assist in rehearsal for a performance.
3,Could be better,"The sander works fine when you can get it to work, but the one complaint I have is that it's hard to turn on and off. I have to struggle with the switch every time I use it. For that reason, I'm giving it just 3 stars."
4,Randy's dreams,"I never heard the late great Randy VanWarmer singing ""Just When I Needed You Most"" in 1979 and he is great. He wrote songs for the Oak Ridge Boys' ""I Guess It Never Hurts to Hurt Sometimes"" in 1984. And in 1992 for Alabama's ""I'm in a hurry I don't know why."" Randy Owen of Alabama put the line it said ""zero to sixty and five point two."" I remember if I love him and it's great and I sent the news for Randy who died on Jan. 12 at 48 just before his 49th birthday in two months."
4,Good Science,"The notebook does everything it needs to do; lets you write on it and leave a copy behind. The only thing that bothered me was that the pages are not ripping friendly, not even the carbon copies. Which makes no sense if your looking to turn a copy in and keep the original to yourself. Other than that everything was fine."
5,Perfect and simple,"This notebook is great! It was required by my high school, and I looked everywhere for this product at a cheep price, but in the end this was the one. It is great for lab work, and leaves behind a duplicate so you have two copies."
4,great book,"A great note book. It worth the price. However, you need to remember to write over the hard sheet, or it would be a tragedy. A great seller."
4,Lab Notebook,"The notebook is great for my Organic Chemistry class. The pages are large enough to get a lot of my data on few pages and it transfers really well onto the carbon paper. There is one issue I have with it though. It's hard to get the carbonless pages out of the notebook when it's time to turn in my report because there are no perforations. If you don't mind ripping or cutting pages out then this is a good notebook, but if you want clean pages then I suggest looking for a different one."
5,I LOVE IT!,"I love this notebook! Especially since it's graph ruled, I can write to much more a page than lined ruled ones.-very well built- the cover flips back!-easy tear pages-not much more expensive than those typical one they sell on campus stores!- it looks professional ;)-a must for any chemist!"
5,Love It,"I think that this notebook is great. I'm using it for my AP chemistry class, and the graph lines on it already helps out so much for making graphs and such."
5,My items,For the books it was a requirement for college.Actron CP9550 OBD-II PocketScan Plus Diagnostic Code Reader saved me money by finding the faulty part and replacing it myself.
2,"Cute toy, but not what is pictured","The brightly colored flip-flap has the soft sides and rattle as described but ours is a 4-interconnected cubes not triangles. It also has various animals that come together instead of the displayed patterns/textures. Baby seems to enjoy the colors and movement. Seems to be of good HABA quality. Just not what we were expecting, we were looking forward to the unfolding triangles."
5,This video rocked!!,"This video is the best video! I love 311 so much! The video shows most of their music videos and some live concert footage. If you don't already have it, you should go buy it."
5,sweeet MOMMA!!!!,"Holy Mother Moses brown . This is the greatest video ever. You will not believe it when you see it. It has raw footage from the boyz on tour , some of their philosphy on thier views on each other . Plus lots of naughty stuff and parephanealia. WEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!! You have to own this video , NOW!"
5,I look into the history of the greatest band ever,"311, ETSD 1, what more can i say people, this is a fantastic video from the blue album era, i especially like transistor intro being used for the menu and intro titles.311 rocks everyone, no dobut about it, if your a fan this is a definate must own"
3,Decent Compilation with Playero-Style Beats,"This was a mixtape released by Machete Music, mostly with harder tracks and original remixes that you won't hear on the radio. I like the beats, which mostly follow a hardcore dembow sound like the old Playero and Noise albums did.One complaint that I have about the mixtape is that Daddy Yankee doesn't actually rap on the ""Muevete y Perrea"" and ""Tu No Tienes Miedo"" tracks, he basically repeats the chorus over and over. The same applies to ""De Nuevo Perriando"" by Panamanian artist Nando Boom, it's basically a beat with an El General sample and Nando singing a chorus for one minute. Also, the songs sound as though they weren't mixed down correctly, the sound quality isn't that great.I like the beats, and this is a good album to throw on at a party and let play from start to finish. But otherwise, this is a good album and not a great one, Machete Music has put out far better compilations in the past."
1,Does this come in spiral bound?,We don't own and probably won't own a Kindle. Can we get a copy of the revised version in paperback or spiralbound?
4,An accurate account of a great ballet!,"I only have one thing to add to the other glowing reviews of this great recording, and that is directed to the review by Adam ""Former Dancer/Ballet Historian"" who called Gergiev's direction ""too symphonic"". It's amusing to me that a ""former dancer/historian"" would use the exact words many critics of both ""The Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Swan Lake"" used in their reviews after inital performances, to knock Gergiev's approach. Rather, the words ""too symphonic"" are percisely what makes this recording great, because Tchaikovsky broke ground in combining symphonic and ballet musical styles into his three ballets. Therefore, if you're looking for a recording that accurately represents what Tchaikovsky invisioned and wrote, this ""too symphonic"" reading is the way to go."
4,A Very Good Beauty,"This recording of ""The Sleeping Beauty"" is performed with passion and high energy by the Kirov orchestra. Valery Gergiev's conducting cannot be faulted as he keeps his players as a tight ensemble and with tempos that are neither too fast or too slow. The problem with this CD set is the recording itself. It is poorly engineered and the sound is muffled and very bass heavy. The violins are pretty much drowned-out throughout the piece. On a personal note I prefer the Previn/LSO recording on the EMI label to this one but I can recommend this one as a close second place."
3,decent winch and easy to use,"I needed a come-a-long to build a chain link fence and this product was very easy to use. Perfect size.However, putting it back into the case was a joke. LOL. Maybe I am no engineer, but the case is now in the garbage."
2,keeps jamming,Cable has jammed in the guides since day 1; attributed to my error though annoying. Gotten worse till now jammed (under a year and not much usage) and became unusable.So a winch is very useful - but will replace with different brand.
1,total crap product,"I almost never buy cheap tools - and this is why. I only needed 2 of these come-alongs for a single use (I have 2 winches that I would normally use). Both broke within the first hour of use. Cheaply built, not up to task. I didn't save the packages, so I don't know if I can return them; but, buyer beware - these are no good."
4,Good buy for the money,"This fella is nice and compact but forget about getting it back into the convenient case. Also, the cable came fouled up and jammed so I was not initially impressed. Not the highest quality but definitely good for the money."
3,model review,My son has bought this toy it is fun to build pieces fall off sometimes if you have little childre keep out off reach if you drop it on the ground it will brake in pieces this is not for playing with but simply to admire
5,awesome,"works just like an oem fog light, much cheaper. replaced a broken one on my 03 cobra and have no complaints at all!"
1,chinese made drill bits being sold as usa bits,"on order number 105-8211336-2555467 I ordered two drill bit sets, Bosch BL0029 and Bosch BL0060. I ordered these bit sets over less expensive Chinese made bits because both bit sets indicated the country of origin as USA and I find American made bits to be of higher quality than Chinese. Imagine my surprise when I open the boxes and find that the bits were not made in USA but in China. Only the index boxes were made in USA. I think it is very deceptive to sell Chinese made product as American made. I am trying to make up my mind now as to whether I am going to return these bit sets for misrepresenting their country of origin."
4,"Very thoughtful, readable and beautifully designed.","I read this book cover to cover and thought it was full of well-thought-out ideas. Any teacher or classroom volunteer could pick and choose among a varitety of ideas and projects -- some would only work in a class that's already working well, others could be the first steps in calming a volitle class. Just reading the book will help the teacher get centered! Loved the drawings. I rarely buy books, and I got this one out of a oublic library to read, but then I actually spent the money and bought a copy to keep. Highly recommended."
1,"Decent ideas, but what a bunch of new age fluff!","This book is filled with feel-good, new age spritualism of questionable efficacy. Quite honestly, if I tried some of these things with my students, they would laugh me out of the room. Don't bother."
1,"Nothin' like the real thing, baby",I do not wish to introduce my very interested grandaughter to American Musicals without the original cast albums. Marnie Nixon is no Gertruce Lawrence. I want Mary Martin doing South Pacific. I wish you had a category of original cast albums.
3,Not sure what makes these Industrial....,"I love sharpies as much as anyone else, but I can't say I have noticed a marked improvement over regular sharpies. Writing on plastic still smears after drying, and I took a brand new one out of the box to find it dried out. They work fine, but don't expect a miracle marker."
5,Superman and Lobo are GREAT!!!!,This was a exciting book! The Justice League is great and Lobo is one of my favorite villains. It was fun seeing Lobo trick Superman into being bad. And it was fun seeing Superman pretending to be bad so that he could do the right thing.
3,Original orchestration,"I bought this recording because it uses Fauré's original orchestration for the Requiem; for example, the solo violin in movement 3: Sanctus, instead of the entire first violin section.I enjoy the orchestra's performance. The choir's and vocal soloists' style aren't to my personal liking, but still provide a satisfying and well executed performance. The sopranos sound more like a boys choir at times rather than a womens choir--a nice touch. The choir is fine if you enjoy British-style non-vibrato choirs. I usually find that particular style a bit more hollow and brassy sounding than I prefer.The rest of the pieces on the recording are also well executed, but don't do much for me. Then again I was mostly interested original orchestration of the Requiem. No doubt those with more educated tastes will appreciate these other pieces more than I."
5,Gardiner Does Faure,"Faure's Grecian, pastel-shaded Requiem works well with the Gardiner steamlined treatment, and Faure's unconventional original scoring - with violins omitted except for a solo violin - is different and refreshing. It makes one wonder if perhaps Faure was beginning to see a way out of the obligatory gray, massed orchestral sound of the 19th century, just as he found modal chord progressions as a way out of the exhaustion of the functional tonal system."
2,Not up to par.,Disappointment! Too much background drumming & chanting that detracts from the reason I bought the CD - to listen to the guitar!
5,Tingstad Touches the Spirit,"Relax and close your eyes as Eric Tingstad takes you on a journey through mountains, valleys, the desert and to a 200 year-old campfire. This album awakens the spirit within and brings mental images of the Southwest and our ancient native american ancestors. The haunting vocals of Petra Stahl serve to immerse you in this experience. Excellent guitar work from Tingstad and kudos to Terry Lauber for superb pedal steel guitar licks that only enhance this journey."
3,So so...,"Not especially evocative of the culture, atmosphere, or landscapes of the southwest. I'm reminded of the salsa commercial that is skeptical about the ""authentic"" taste of a salsa made in ""New York City?!"" Tingstand's ""Southwest"" sort of sounds as if it has a feel for the great southwest ...unless you're a native."
1,Need to be Zero Stars for this one,"Product does not work after two days of effort on two computers... nothing written in understandable English. Computer wants to recognize it as Microsoft serial mouse. WIth 25 years of computer experience, I must say that this is one of the worst products I have ever bought and with no support from seller... and terrible return policies, AVOID."
2,Disapointed,"After reading the other reviews I thought I had a winner for a good family movie when I ordered this one, but we were severely disappointed. The movie was very slow, but the worst part is the swearing. If you don't want to listen to a lot of bad language, you will not want to buy this film."
3,"Good move, except....","This was entertaining and fun to watch. However it shows the people in their local church as hateful, and even glad that the boy was sent back to prison. This is not the way that Christian people would normally act. Also, the two grown children acted like 2 year olds. The remainder of the movie was very interesting."
3,movie,This ad did not mention that the movie is not the orginal version because it is missing scenes
1,What about the sons examples???,"I like to see what I am buying, and you in this CD do not offer any list of the sons in the CD. Why???? therefore, how can I give a rate?"
3,Open box,One of the hood shock has been previously open and looser than the otrer one iinstalled on the other side of the vehiclePrice is right and it works
2,not worth the money,I did not think this DVD was worth the money. It jumped around a lot and was not helpful. There are better and more complete DVD's out there than this. I was also not impressed with the art of knit and crochet either. It was just as bad. I was very disappointed.
4,It's an ok dvd.,it's perfict for begginers and there are useful things not so much instruction. you have to watch it to figer it out. which that is why it is a dvd.
2,basis knitting and crochet dvd,"I was hoping to learn more knitting and crochet skills with this dvd. I am very disappointed. The knitting and crochet skills that demonstraed in the dvd are so basic you can learn in youtube.Youtube has more knitting and crochets skills that you can learn for the beginner to advance knitter and crocheters than this dvd. This dvd is not suitable to intermediate and advance knitter who are hoping to learn some knitting and crochet skills at their level. In the dvd, there was a talk about alpaca yarn, how it has lustre and light and warmer than wool, but all the alpaca yarns(which are blend) I see are dull, harsh to the skin and not lighter than wool but at four times the price of natural wool. Although I must admit I like the talk about colour, but this not show how to use it in your knitting. This dvd is more talking about knitting than the actual teaching the knitting skills."
2,"Mediocre pictures, very poor movie mode","The Nikon Coolpix 3700's pictures are no where near as quality as my old Canon or the Sony Cybershot P73. The photos I took inside were washed out and a bit grainy.But the main reason I've chosen to return this camera is the movie mode. The sync between audio and video is terrible, and there is a continuous clicking noise through each video. I've heard that the clicking noise is from the lens focusing in continuous focus mode, but even when I stood very still, filming one thing, the clicking persisted."
3,Good but.........,"Becareful it blocks and doesnt work, it appears ""lens error"".It was sent because of the warranty and it last only 15 pictures and continue with the same problem.Nikon says to send it again but they wont change it for a new one. I am not agree with this, the same problem twice is not worth it any more.Is not a good warranty.This maybe happen to you."
2,Doesn't stick to my car!,"I bought this from another site, but I'm assuming it's manufactured by the same company. I bought the magnet version rather than adhesive because my husband would kill me if I damaged the paint job on our car. But with the magnet it doesn't stick. Not even for a second.... not where I ~want~ it to, anyway. The back hatch of my SUV apparently is not made of metal. So check that out on your own vehicle before purchasing anything magnetic."
3,"Lots of vigor, but no poetry or joy","While staying in a friend's house and faced with a small record collection, I put on this coupling of the Triple Cto. and Choral Fantasy from 1992-93. My hopes weren't high. I am not a fan of the Beaux Arts Trio or Masur. I cannot say that the performances exceeded even my low expectations. Masur's conducting is vigorous, but in the Triple Cto. it turns abrasive and brusque in the finale, exactly the wrong tone for that ebullient, light-hearted movement. The three soloists are proficient but ordinary, and they suffer from a lack of poetry -- without generosity of spirit, this work comes off as second-rate Beethoven, but in the right spirit it can be delightful. As for the choral Fantasy, it fares even worse, perhaps. Pressler's lack of joy is painful, and Beethoven's high spirits go for naught.In short, both readings deserve a bit of respect for their professionalism but not a speck of affection or love."
5,Perfect size for cruisers,"I refurbished an old 80's Murray cruiser, and did not like the narrow stock bars (24"" wide) so I purchased the Sunlite Cruiser Retro Handlebars to add more stability and that ""cruiser look"". The bike changed dramatically once I installed them. The look is perfect, they have a very nice chrome finish, and the rise plus 4"" extra width of the bars provides a more comfortable riding position, and a feeling of better control in turns and rough roads."
3,these are ok for me,"I ordered these when I should have ordered wider bars for my stretch cruiser. They would probably be pretty cool on a standard cruiser. They are a little less than 28"" wide. I guess I'll keep them and maybe use them in the future on a different bike."
5,God bless the existence of horehound!,"I use this whenever my asthma starts to come around. Used to I would need to take a round of prednisone to get over my lung issues after a cold...wish I had discovered this years ago!I do not know if horehound helps the asthma that constricts the lungs, but it sure works for the asthma from inflammation. And better yet, it works on symptoms practically instantly, no waiting several days for the predinsone to do its thing.I also give it to my kids when they get a cough cold, and it keeps that nasty cough down and heals it up fast.Add some prophylacticClaeys Sanded Horehound Candy Drops ~ 2 Lbs ~ Old Fashioned Flavorinto the picture and life is good."
3,Testosterone Down,"This movie was not what I thought it was going to be like. I don't know why a lot of gay themed movies are so violent. The best thing about this movie was David Sutcliffe and Anotnio Sabato, Jr. Both are good actors, but I thought they're acting was wasted in this movie. There is a lot of deception and foreign intrigue. I did like the outtakes and the alternate ending in the special features. I was very disappointed, I am sorry to say."
2,Don't ! Just Rent it.,"Very disappointing. If one's expecting a hot scene, you won't get it, not even a warm scene. Weak plot. The guy travels from the USA to Argentina after his lover, but he doesn't convince me. He doesn't seem to be neither in love nor suffering. He's always smirking. If one's after Sabato's toy, the scene is flash, forget it. It seems to me that, apart from very few movies, most of them suffers from a weakness in their plots, their direction, their acting. And they lack real love feeling, such as in ""Just a question of love"" (Fr), ""Later Days"" (although the main actor's acting is weak (the religious guy) )."
2,Interesting Premise Lost to Bad Execution,The only good thing about this film is the acting. Period. The plot spins out of control 15 minutes into the film. The script is poorly written and the emotional attachment to the characters is non-existant. I honestly do not recommend this film.
5,mysterious and sexy,"This movie was one of the few (...) movies I've seen to portray accurately the madness associated with obsession and what obsession will drive a man to do.David Sutcliffe is very (...), as is Leonardo Brzezicki, who is fantastic as the villain in this movie. Coolidge is very funny in a role that is completely new and different for this great actress.I loved the ending, especially the final, really unexpected twist that solves the mystery that's been building the whole movie. It's beautifully shot and the acting is really terrific.Kudos, and thanks, to the director for the great ride!"
3,Not Formatted!!!,"I can't believe in all of the reviews no one has mentioned the horrible formatting -- or lack thereof -- of this DVD. I saw this film at the Atlanta Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and loved it. David Sutcliffe, I predict, will be a huge star (And he's no so bad to look at either). However, when I rented this DVD I was appalled to find that the film was not formatted for TV viewing. Because of this, the opening sequence that sets up the movie is unwatchable, as much of the wording and pictures on the screen are cut off. And it only gets worse from there as every scene has the left and right of the frame cut off. For shame!! I stopped watching after 30 minutes and returned it to the video store.I would have given this a 5 star rating if not for the horrible lack of formatting. I gave it 3 stars only because I originally liked the film. Buyer/renter beware..."
2,Peculiar,"""Testosterone"" has two features that many others gay theme movies can only dream of: good actors (well, majority of the cast) and not the lowest budget.However, ""Testosterone"" fits ""those many others"" films well. And I mean ""well"" in negative meaning.The plot's character is hard to describe. At some moments it seems to be a dark and gloomy (with kind of light and entertaining music in background...wth???).Then, some events are showed as if the whole enterprise was nothing more than a poor parody of a thriller...I don't even mention the final, because it is ages since I have seen such a dumb ending.Second star for Sonia Braga, who potrays bitchy mother of ""lost in action"" argentinean lover."
1,Clumsy mess...,"This beautifully staged film was an incredible disappointment. The acting is fair enough although the main character overdoes it more often than not. What really floored me was the truly bad writing, repeatedly failed attempts at trying to be humourous, perfectly naive and implausible situations, one after another, and annoying use of silly music when it was out of place (the suicide scene comes to mind). The opening number is good though in its Italian vocal scat bossa style. What a waste of production values which could have gone to a well written and thought out movie. I felt that the public was taken for idiots trying to swallow this bad attempt at a ""comedy""."
1,Simply Awful,"This movie is alternately boring and silly. The acting is just terrible, and the story itself is not in the least bit entertaining."
1,IT SUCKED!,"If you want to see a good gay movie, get GRANDE ECOLE, LATTER DAYS or NEVERLAND (the modern gay version of PETER PAN - NOT the Johnny Depp movie!). All of these movie were interesting and involving and had HOT GUYS in them. TESTOSTERONE SUCKED. Horrible."
5,One of my favorite books,"This is one of my all time favorite books. Not only for hypnosis but for an overall understanding of NLP, therapy, and the implications of these modalities. Because of this book, I have gone back to school to become a hypnotherapist. If you have any curiosity as to how hypnosis works and what it is, buy this book before you get any others. I have over forty books on the subject and to this day, this has been the most inspirational and influental. The book also has many references to other authors that have been invaluable to me. Unfortunately he passed away but his legacy lives on. BUY THIS BOOK!!!"
5,Monsters and Magical Sticks,Several years ago a friend loaned me his copy of Monsters and Magical Sticks. Within a few pages I knew that I was reading the work of geniuses. For months after I searched for a copy to call my own. Finally I found one. Both my training and therapeutic style have been fantastically improved! I am thrilled that this jewel is now more readily accessible. IT'S A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE WHO CONDUCTS TRAININGS AND/OR THERAPY. My hope is to one day talk with Dr. Heller or Ms. Steele and/or to attend one of their trainings. ...
4,Excellent twist on being a more effective hypnotist,"I enjoyed this book immensely. Although much of what's written came to me as common sense, I needed an underscoring of what I and most of us already know--that to be effective we need to work on replacing a client's negative metaphor with another positive one. That makes so much sense to me. The only complaint I have (hence the 4 star rating) is the fact that I have the 8th edition, which was printed in 2009, and amazingly there are still numerous typos and grammatical errors. Why haven't any of these errors been caught yet? Hopefully, in the next printing, the publisher will do this fine author a favor and correct these needless flaws so that at least those of us who value the English language can put all our energy on the book's immensely helpful content."
1,"Impressed, but not that impressed","I am impressed with the CD, however it skips on track 6 at the 59:00 second mark, and it is an inconveniece, because I paid good money for this CD, and it does this. I would like to exchange it for a new one at no extra cost or I will take my business else where"
4,MN Twins Cap,"I received this item from Amazon, and am very satisfied with the purchase. I did not realize how simple the online purchase process was. Amazon sent me a quality product in a short period of time. Well done!"
3,"Tuning In, Dropping Out","Hamish Miller had already begun to question his competitive and stressful lifestyle, but a near-death experience at 53 convinced him to drop out of the rat race and tune in to nature and humanity as a ""simple servant."" He explains the new direction of his life and inspiration in this interview from his home in Cornwall."
3,"Simple concept, but is it realistic?","Do you want to live in peace and harmony with your community? I sure do and if you buy into these theories presented in this DVD, it is not only possible but probable. By all people who want a peaceful way of life grouping together, Hamish believes that we can change the direction the world is in and headed towards. This is his description of a one world community. His plan is interesting but not plausible in my opinion. That does not make this DVD and less interesting though. His life-changing event took him on another path and it is entertaining to hear his passion for peace."
2,Gummy texture with medicinal chocolate flavor,"For a product with this much sugar, you'd expect it to taste really good. Not so with these bars. They taste like gummy chocolate vitamin bars and are not worth the calories. For the same calories and nutrition, you can do a lot better."
3,Decent meal-replacement bar,"To justify the 3-star rating:Taste is 5/5. Double Fudge Brownie isn't the only flavor, but I've yet to have one I disliked. None of them taste like cardboard, they all taste like a normal candy bar, but a little more dry - eat it with 8oz skim milk. That being said, despite having a higher amount of protein than some others out there, the target audience for this product beware - which leads to the 3 star rating.Amount of calories to those of fat isn't bad at 290 to 50. The problem is the 27g of sugar, 4g saturated fat, and 1g trans-fat. All the flavors have slight differences as other ingredients are used (duh), so pick your poison.IMO a better bar is the Power Bar Protein Plus Reduced Sugar"
3,Please ship fresher bars,I was excited to sign up for the subscribe and save option after buying fresh Double Fudge bars at an out-of-state retailer. The best buy date on those bars was 2/17/2012 and they were soft and fresh and delicious! The box of bars I just received has a best buy date of 10/4/11 and they are firm and chalky.
2,Not the same as the old Chocolate Fudge Brownie...,"They changed the recipe of my old favorite, Chocolate Fudge Brownie, and this one isn't nearly as good. I've taken it off my ""rotation"" of ProMax flavors. Boo!"
2,Have not received,"I purchased a Shaker Dining Table on the May 11th..it is now the 18th, and my status says : Will ship soon (which it has said since the day I ordered it).I had ordered chairs from another seller at the same time, and they are here and put together and waiting for the table.I have sent several messages, with no response.I wish I would have read other peoples feedback first, because I probably would not have dealt with these people"
3,Gieseking Plays Beethoven,"The great pianist died in the midst of recording Beethoven's Sonatas complete in London. Unkind critics, unappreciative of the mature Gieseking's reserve in this music, suggested he had perhaps died of boredom. Listening, again, decades later, the considerable subtlety this artist brought to almost everything he played is in evidence, but it is far from the Beethoven of Schnabel, Backhaus, Brendel, Gilels, Kempff . . . to name but five. The sound is far better than the dull Angel lps, but is still far from the best EMI and producer Walter Legge could accomplish at the time. Recommended to those with an interest in this great artist and in the repertoire."
2,Color Me Beautiful's Looking Your Best:,"Upon reading and studying this book thoroughly, I have to say I find that while these two authors have expanded the original Carole Jackson's Color Me Beautiful system to include 12 seasonal types rather than just the 4 original ones,which needed done,I agree,I think that this book lacked a spark of something the origonal had even though it was not definitive enough.I also did not find the color sample patches large or clear enough to follow-they look like they were made with a wax crayon!I think that with some re-doing, this book could be a real winner, but as it stands I have to give it one less star than the origonal had.I am looking forward to reading this book's update..."
3,still good,"Still a good reference, though there are newer CMB books that offer a wider range than the 4 choices here."
5,"Color Me Beautiful, Looking Your Best","This is a fun book to read and has some great color pictures to illustrate. If you are interested in discovering which colors you look best in, this book has a lot of good ideas to help you. While reading and comparing the pictures, I discovered that I had changed seasons from a few years ago, and it was fun to get new color swatches, too. This book also has some great tips for applying eye makeup that I really liked, since I have just decided to wear eye makeup again, and I had forgotten everything I knew! A good book to keep in my library."
2,So confused!,"I am one of the women who is suppose to find this book helpful because I do not neatly fall into one of the four seasons ....my mother thinks I am a summer, my hairdresser thinks I am a Spring, my husband says I am an autumn. So I buy this book and now I am more confused then ever! The authors use terms they do not define such as muted or topaz, terms which are critical to me being able to sort out my season confusion. Then they suggest I use ""color draping"" by grabbing clothes or even towels from around the house that match obscure and subtle color differences. Ah, I do not have a ""mango"" and ""salmon"" towels or at least I do not think I do. It is hard to tell since the color swatches in the book are as bad as everyone else complains they are. On the up side, I have reread the book four times and really want to like it but I still have NO idea what colors would suit me. Bottom line...do not buy this book."
2,Color me with wax crayons!,"Ok if your short on cash buy the original Color me beautiful book. For many of my friends and I who felt that we were torn between two palettes, the expansions did not really clear things up for us... The color palettes really are an embarrassment! whos 3year old colored the squares for the coauthors? This IS a book on color so if you are real torn see the original book ok its dated in fashon but really does a much better job in the color department. As for the makeup section it stinks. I don't agree with their suggestions for eye makeup and eyeliner for alot of people... The best book on makeup is Carole Jackson's color me beautiful make up book... nothing comes close except a professional makeup artists manual I have. Bottom line, stick to Carole Jackson's books for the best information."
3,Helpful but flawed,"The text of the book is very helpful. The exercises that are presented helped me to identify my color with some certainty. However, the color swatches presented in the book are so bad that they are next to useless. For example, a color swatch labeled ""navy"" looks teal. I am amazed that the editors allowed what might have been a very good book to be severely marred by the poor printing of colors. After all, this IS a book about color."
2,Color Me With Confusion!,"I have NEVER been able to figure out my ""season"" with either Carole Jackson's Book, or with this one by Mary Spillane. I do not fit into any of the categories they suggest ,even though the seasons are expanded in Spillane's book. (I have ashen blonde hair color like a Summer, olive green/golden brown eyes like an Autumn, and pale translucent ivory skin , like a Spring). The color palletes look like coloring book swatches that were done by a five year old (what are we supposed to gain from that !) Overall a huge disappointment, and only helpful purhaps to those who have well defined seasonal characteristics. For the rest of us, I would suggest basing your color choices on compliments you get from friends and family, and even strangers, and taking your clues from them."
2,Nice Tips~,"This was a long, somewhat boring lecture in the form of a book for beginners.I understand/appreciate the importance of motivation and I thought the author had ""some"" inspiring things to share. This book combines some old empowerment with some ""new"" tips on how ""we the people"" can take action and make a difference."
2,Not much in there,"The writing is okay, Steve Elliot sets the stage well, and I was waiting for the revolution....but it never came. Not much in this book, besides ""I worked hard, I got lucky, now I have a successful website"". I'm not even all that convinced that his ""Grassfire"" efforts are all that successful, because anybody can make the same unsubstantiated claims. Lots of his supporters seem to have written reviews here, but don't buy the hype."
1,This book is ridiculous,"This book could be summed up in one sentence: ""I found out that if you email people and have them email other people, you can contact a lot of people"". There is no revolution here, nothing earth-shattering, nothing new. Steve Elliot drones on and on to fill up a book, but there is really no substance to his writing. Often, at the end of a chapter, it was difficult to remember just what that chapter was about, other than the fact that it had something to do with how clever Mr. Elliot is. There will be plenty of people who say that this book is ""revolutionary, life-changing, etc"". Those reviews must be by his family and friends."
3,A little on the expensive side ....,"...for a bunch of drills made in China. It is, however, a very complete set of drills with fine gradation between each size of bit. If you're looking for a set of machinist-type wire gauge drills you might consider these. I bought this bit set to use when rebuilding vintage carburetors so it is not going to get any hard use; most of the bits I'll be using will be the smaller ones. I cannot attest to the long-term durability of this drill set; for my use I think they will work just fine. I would have given this drill set a higher rating but the cost combined with the fact they are Chinese-made knocked them down. I think it would be a great help to Amazon customers looking to support our economy and to support American-made manufacturing if Amazon began noting the country of origin for each item."
1,Meh,they drill i guess. maybe i expected too much. good for light non metal jobs. dont expect much more out of them
