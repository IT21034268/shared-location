4,WW II Buff,This was a gift to my eleven year old son for his birthday. He loves old World War II movies with a lot of action and this one had a lot of action which kept him interested. It was a relly good addition to his collection.
4,Good Movie,"Another one of those classics that I enjoyed watching as a kid. Couldn't wait to grab it on DVD, and at a good price at that."
4,Great War Movie,Great War MovieGreat footage of old warfare and films of warfare tacticsOne of the many war fils members of my Post have asked for to watch.Arrived on time and in excellent shape - I will use this seller again.
2,Not worth the $,"Very disappointed with the product; video was grainy and audio was also poor. I had to crank up the volume all the way to hear. The English subtitles were annoying; perhaps this product is targeted for the hearing impaired. I shouldn't have been surprised, when I first opened the case after removing the sealed wrapper I noticed the CD media didn't have any kind of label in the center. Not sure what ""keepcase"" means, maybe a legal copy. To me it means the case is worth keeping but the DVD inside is not..."
4,Memphis Bell - Worth watching.......,"I think the historical accuracy of ""Memphis Belle"" is very questionable but from an entertainment aspect and film-making quality, it was very good. The depiction of what it was like to have flown against such an enemy at a time where the outcome of the war was very much in question with such incredible odds against surviving is mind-numbing."
3,Okay but could have been better,"I saw this film may years ago and wanted to see it again after recently reading a book about bombers in WW2. It's quite a good film; once it gets into the air about half way through it certainly improves and the aircraft action scenes are pretty good so the film won't disappoint. The reasons why it only gets 3 stars are not big reasons but nevertheless: (1) the talk over at the beginning is vomit inducing, the film has too many cliches and becomes too predictable (even though we know how it will end) and most the aircrew (10 of them) are, for me anyway, very irritating young actors! At the end of the day, in spite of everything the movie is a light-weight when it should have been better."
5,"If you think our military are HEROS, this is the movie for you!","When you see the B-17 Bomber, with a large crew in small spaces and their bravery in the face of heavy German gunfire from the ground, you get a taste of what courage it took, to defend America."
3,It's an ok movie,"Regardless of the era when the movie was created, I expected more from a film covering World War II. I enjoyed it however it did not live up to my expectations. Expected plot which was simple to follow."
5,Nostalgia and knowledge of the 8th Air Force,A sympathetic and family friendly look at B-17 flying in early to mid WWII European theater. A good view of the postive contributions by the Greatest Generation. It is reaonably accurate for what the air war was like at that time.
3,Ummm... Where was the film crew?,"During the real 25th mission of this aircraft, she had, on her a film crew, that made the Documentary, Memphis Belle, which is one of the most amazing movies ever made... Go see that... it is only forty-five minutes, is historically accurate, and is more intense, more exciting, and real.This movie, while visually entertaining, does not do this aircraft, or the members of the 8th Airforce justice."
1,horrible quality,I really got screwed because the product information indicated this was a dvd in widescreen format. When I played it on my blu ray player (I frequently playback dvd's on my blu ray) the only format it would play in is the square screen or non-widescreen format. The image was also quite grainy. I suppose I will have to wait for this movie to be available in widescreen blu ray before I will be satisfied.
1,memphis belle,as we havent yet recieved this dvd we cannot review it. it is over a week overdue. so is the battle of britian we ordered.
2,Save Your Money...........,"...........and buy ""Twelve O'Clock High""! While it was nice to see the status of many of the surviving Fortresses, the film's credibility was far too suspect to recommend it. I mean Wyler's own documentary of the Belle's last mission (actually a bit of a ""Milk Run"") is both more relevant - and, despite its blatantly clear emphasis on war time propoganda, far more accurate. I suspect that many bomber crew members winced quite a bit when Modine decides to repeat the bomb run - and in so doing run the risk of incurring still more casualties -so as to avoid bombing a nearby school!"
3,Too many cliches and absurd moments,"When this movie premiered in 1990 I went to see it with my Uncle who was a Flight Engineer/Gunner with a B-24 Wing in England 1944-45. It looked like it would have good production values (it did) and a good story (it didn't). My uncle hated it! He said that there were way too many absurd moments in this movie for him to take it seriously. He enjoyed the documentary ""Memphis Belle"" much more and he ranks ""12 O'Clock High"" as king of the WW-II flying movies. I agree with him!If you get this DVD use the chapter stops -- go to the flying sequences and combat scenes -- crank up your surround sound and enjoy. Skip the rest!"
4,Memphis Belle,"This is an endearing movie. The breathtaking scenery of Western Europe is wonderfully shot. There is also excellent aerial footage of the B-17 Flying Fortress. The cast members are top notch; Billy Zane, John Lithgow, Harry Connick Jr, Sean Astin etc. Although much literary license is used in telling the story of the 25th (final) mission of the Memphis Belle, that is its' only misgiving. You will laugh and cheer at the ensemble cast of misfits as they team together during the final flight. You will share their concerns, expectations, and fears. Action, thrills, and drama without ""blood and gore"" this is one war movie everyone will enjoy!"
4,"Very good, but for entirely different reason(s) !","The reviewer here is graying son of a father who flew 27-missions as crew on a B17F out'a Parham, England c1943. (The Belle is an ""F"" in this same timeframe.) Like other reviwers I understand that at best the plot roughly matches events surrounding the first crew to finich their 25 missions. Yet the real import to me is how accurately the settings, interactions, and 'feel' matches everything my Dad ever said about his experiences. Including the frigid clear-blue calm instantly punctuated by sheer-terror only to retun moments later to serenity with no hint of the mayhem of moments earlier except for the holes in the ship, spent 50-caliber rounds, and the wounded. The dialog, the on-the-ground stand-by and in-flight routine all rang true. And I really finally understood that look in his eye to the enevitable phrase on the out-bound leg of each flight, ""Sir, that's the Third Reich down there."""
3,Snailtrails,"Metallic acid grunge from the early nineties. Imagine a conflation of Nirvana circa Bleach, Tad and Kyuss with a lot more reverb on the vocals and half the passion. It's not bad really, just not that well recorded or memorable and if you're a fan of the afore mentioned bands you've heard this all before."
3,5 stars for the book but…,"Today I'm pretty much going through annd reviewing everything I've read this week that I was to lazy to do when I first read them, so moving onward… the lodger is a wonderfully paced tale of suspence set in London in the early years of the 20th centuary, does the book have flaws? Yes but not in context, the formatting of the free kindle edition is terribly flawed. Some times the text would dothis mid-sentence.Or the paragraph wouldn't be indented.Or Things that didn't Need to be capatalized Were.So 5 stars for the book but I have to drop a star for formatting. Personally it's free isn't an excuse."
4,A Great Read,"I loved this book. It was not the horror story that I was expecting, but more of the classic tale of suspense and spine tingling situations. If you need a lot of ""blood and guts"", this is not the book for you. If you want a great book to read, cozied up the the fire with a cup of tea, prepare to enjoy!"
4,Suspensful and Thrilling,I am glad I listened to others and tried this book as I couldn't put it down. I lve the writing style and hope to find more books by this author.
2,"Uneven Suspense, Slap-Dash Finish","What opens with a compelling premise - a mysterious lodger who arrives in the midst of a wave of serial killings - is encumbered by a plethora of spelling, punctuation and formatting errors as well as inconsistency in the dialects of its characters. Perhaps because I'm an avid fan of mysteries and suspense novels, my expectations were high that a few delicious twists might save the plot before it came to a close. Although it's my understanding that the Kindle version was prepped by volunteers for electronic publication, it's sad that their enthusiasm for the text wasn't reflected in more judicious proofreading."
4,Another take on a well known story,"A nicely written book about a notorious unsolved case. Many suggestions and opinions have been proffered over the years. Here is another one, albeit a criminal one.Without wishing to spoil the read, I will just comment that this case made it to the Chamber of Horrors."
4,A great suspense book,"I selected this book because it made the list of 100 suspense books to read. I was glad to see it was even one of Amazon's free reads! Because the author wrote this long ago, I felt the language added to the suspense of this England based story. Great, developed characters and the book moved along quite well. It was interesting to read such a good book written a long time ago and it added some charm to a story about a couple who rent a room to a killer and they even suspect but they need his rent money! Great ""middle of the night"" reading!"
3,Not the Crossover You Were Hoping For...,"It's true, Rice does ressurrect three of her vampires preferees, but the merging of the Mayfair world into that of the vampires was sorely disappointing. This is not to say that it was a poor read; on the contrary. If one is unfamiliar with Rice's work, this might be the right one to start off with, and then back-track through the others. There are vivid voodoo and verdant jungle vignettes, and vintage Rice descriptive storytelling. But do not look for Rowan Mayfair and her Taltos ilk, or a livelier Lestat to be up to his old tricks. Lestat is pretty much in a spiritual coma throughout the whole book, until the time comes for his deus ex machina scene with Louis. I recommend this book for the die-hard Rice fan."
4,A feast with old friends and new.,"Having love the Lestat part of the Vampire Chronicles I've found myself bored with the recent additions to the Vampire tales until Merrick. This was a refreshing new visit with old friends. It was wonderful to see what David, Louie and Lestat have been up to. Merrick is a refreshing and mystical new addition. The passion she has for David and the triangle that occurs between Merrick, David and Louie is scrumptious. The return of Claudia and the question that remains with that visit continue the readers agony for Louis. I am for the first time and several years sitting in anticipation to see what happens next. Thanks Ms. Rice."
3,Not the best of the Vampire Chronicles,"This isn't Rice's best - it feels as if she is setting up for something big in the next release. The first 100 pages or so were tough, but once she got into the groove, this book was a fast read I couldn't put down. This book blends two story lines together - tying together Rice's Witch series with the Vampire one. Definitely worth a read, but not the best from one of my favorite authors."
4,Getting back to basics,"Anne has returned to her roots of supernatural story telling. Her 23 previous vampire books (Vittrilo & Pandora) were a let down for me because the main characters were supernatural for about 20 pages between the two books. This one is different. Blending Voodoo with the world of vampires allows the entire story to focus on supernatural characters. From the first chapter we know that the characters do not live in our world of logic and security but in their own world of passion, death and the unknown having more power then anything. I applaud Anne for returning to the story which focuses on the supernatural and not a story about a person where, oh yeah, one of the characters is a vampire...Thank you Anne."
2,A Bloody Waste,"I loved the early Vampire and Mayfair witches series, but I think Anne Rice has lost the formula somehow - or rather that she is too formulaic and pumps out books too quickly. Merrick dragged on and on for me. Maybe it's just that the characters are so predictable at this point and the ins and outs so contrived, that I've become bored with her later novels. I only hope she returns to the terrific storytelling she used to captivate us in the beginning."
1,A painful experience.,Its obvious from this novel that Rice has run out of decent vampire related ideas. This dull and rather shallow book is a difficult read at best. Very little reason is given for the reader to even bother turning the page. When you put it down you will have a hard time picking it back up again.
1,"I wanted to vote ""no stars"" but it wasn't an option.","This is it. The last Rice book I'll ever read. I still enjoy her earlier works; ""The Vampire Lestat"" is a classic and I consider it to be her best. But I couldn't even get through ""Merrick."" Rice's prose is becoming too flowery even for her. I mean, really, folks; how many times does she have to halt her narrative to remind us how beautiful Louis is? She meanders off the subject so often that I'm surprised she even remembers her own plots.I have skipped over maybe half the novel already, just skimming the interesting parts. I'm glad I checked this out from the library instead of actually paying for this piece of garbage. Someone needs to tell Rice that she is getting senile. At least, that's the way ""Merrick"" reads.And it looks as though it carries on to the younger generation. Her son's novel, ""A Density of Souls,"" is exactly the same way. I couldn't finish that one either."
2,What was the point?,"This is certainly not one of Anne's better chronicles. The plot for this novel is not strong. Perhaps it was an excuse to introduce Merrick a with who became a vampire.In this novel David Talbot seeks Merrick, who is a powerful witch to resurrect Claudia in order to ease Louis' heart and conscience. When resurrected, Claudia takes her revenge by stabbing Louis in her spite.Heartbroken, Louis tried to kill himself by letting himself out into the light. But his attempt was not successful as he was rescued by the other vampires. In the course of the story, Louis gives Merrick the Dark Gift making her a vampire too.This is a merry story but not quite on par with Anne's other chronicles. Read this only if you must."
1,If there was a the choice of no stars...,"For the first time, I'm ashamed to be reading an Anne Rice book.She filled me up with the fantastic tales of Interveiw, Lestat and The Queen, didn't read the Body Theif or Memnoch, she kept me looking and searching with Pandora, Viterrio and than low and behold Armand!Than this... I even bought it in hardcover, stared at it began to read it, put it on the shelf. Six months later I crawled away from the cess pit of card board cut outs.If Rice had wanted to write why didn't she just publish it on-line? IT would have saved me [money]...(I live in Australia)and I could have turned from it.At least her new one, Blood and Gold is decent."
2,honestly,"i've never been able to get past the first couple chapters of this book, which is not something i normally do with an Anne rice book. i came to this site to read the other reviews to determine why i have so many problems getting into this book, i skipped to and i had no problems reading Blood and gold marius's story.. i have Blackwood farm and Blood canticle to finish. i'll give it another chance.. thanks!"
3,Review by Tara,"I love all of my Vampire Chronicle books, but I do have to say that this one did not touch me as much as I had hoped. The story on its own merits is good. I just did not get to spend the time with the charecters I truley wanted to. Anne Rice has done this before, when she went from INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE to THE VAMPIRE LESTAT. That was very successful we all fell in love with Lestat. I just never felt as if I truley cared for David Talbot, or his adventures. As for the charecter Merrick, she is very interesting. The time you do get to spend with our old friends, Louis, Claudia, and Lestat is well spent and revives some of the chills you had in the very first of these books."
3,Too short,"As somebody else previousely said, I really wanted to love this book as I have loved some of her others. But it seemed like 200 of its 300 pages were exposition! Then when the real ""page-turning"" story began, the book was over. I hope this is merely a prequel for what could become a great story line. I still enjoyed the book, and eagerly await the following tales."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"There is not a lot to see here. This is a crossover with the witch bunch of books, and the Talamasca also features. David Talbot and friend Merrick recount some adventures in the past with supernatural entities, and yet another vamp, this time Louis, tries the sun bathing but gets rescued.David Talbot tells the Talamasca, after Merrick has succeeding in becoming a vampire that declaring war on the vampires because of this would end very badly for them."
5,The return of the Vampire Chronicles,"The chronicles are back! After Pandora and MTD I had decided Anne Rice was sick and tired of the characters. That she was determined to produce more Vampire Chronicles only to feed the demand of her readers, but was desperate to evolve the series into something entirely different. If you feel the same, then you must read Merrick immediately.It introduces and focuses on a new character, and admittedly isn't concerned with vampires through much of the novel. But, after Merrick's story is completed, the rest of the book is dedicated to a welcome continuation of Louis, Lestat, and David Talbot.One word of caution: If you are not already a fan of Anne Rice, in particular the Vampire Chronicles, you should not start with this book. You must go to the beginning of the series or you will not have the appropriate context."
4,The next best thing,"I feel that there is no way Anne Rice could ever top the success she achieved with Interview with a Vampire, but she did a considerably good job with this novel. Our favorite characters are still here, Louis and Lestat, in this continuation in the Vampire Chronicles.Though I was not initially impressed with the plot line of the book, I found that it grew on me, and half way through the story I was immensly immersed. I would recommed this book to nearly anyone. Hope you enjoy!"
2,Talky and Disappointing,"After all my anticipation, this book just left me flat. Too much talk and recollection, very little actual action. The main plot engine - the recall of Claudia's ghost - turned out to be an anti-climax, and it was never resolved as to whether it was ""real"" or not. The other major plot turn happened ""off-stage"" and was explained only briefly by the two participants. This book read to me as though Rice simply published her first draft - even containing misspellings. According to the A&E Biography show, Rice refuses to be edited. IMHO, she is doing herself a disservice."
1,no meat to the bite,"Like the rest of her most recent books, 'Merrick' fails to really tell a story that is worthy of the status of a novel. Missing are the complexities of plot and history that made her earlier works like 'Interview with the Vampire' and 'The Witching Hour' so compelling. Although she is the master of description and able to create vivid mood, she fails to illuminate. 'Merrick' doesn't stand on its own...it's merely an appendix. This is not a novel, but a chapter of one. It leaves the reader frustrated."
2,PLEASE revive the original characters,"Will Anne Rice have the heart to tarnish a character she has built over so many immortal years? LOUIS, the beloved of Lestat and many fans of the chronicles has always been the beautiful one, not just physically, but in heart, in spirit, in mind and in character. Isn't Louis the one who is gentle yet strong, refined, loyal, patient and loving in character? Haven't some of the most beautiful and memorable moments in the chronicles been marked by the love and loyalty between Louis and his maker despite all? We were looking forward to some brilliant adventures of Lestat and Louis ... instead, we had Merrick."
1,One of Ann Rice's Worst books,This book was actually worse than Memnoch or Body Thief(which I hated both). Although not the worst book of hers that I have had the misfortune of reading and yes at one time she was one of my favorite authors. My advise avoid this book. It was so badly done that I never want to read another one of her books again. Read the first three books in the series and Pandora. They are actually worth it. The rest are not very good.
1,The Judy Collins of the Goth Set,"Why is every person in Anne Rice books so unbelievably beautiful, smart and fabulously wealthy?Why can't there be a story of an ugly, poor person who gets the ""Dark Gift"" and spends the book in a rage at being stuck for eternity trying to fit in with the Vampire in crowd?It could be a nice departure for Anne, considering the formulaic dreck she's turning out these days."
3,Unclear focus,"Like many Anne Rice fans, we have watched her writing fade. This attempt at bringing her two chronicles together--the vampires and the witches--failed to coalesce for me."
3,She can do much better,"I feel that Anne Rice is a great writer, but frankly this is not one of her greatest books. Her creativity was not at its peak since the ending, for anyone who has read all or most of the Vampire Chronicles, was so predictable. Frankly, I was a little bored and had to put the book down for a moment as David rambled on about Merrick's life with the Talamasca. The book really has no point , and was quite disappointing. Mixing mayfair witches and vampires was not a good combination and should be kept separate. I am not saying that the book was completely atrocious, and I do recommend it for anyone who is interested in the people David once knew and loved in his mortal years."
1,A Shocking Disappointment,"I'm still in a state of shock that my beloved Anne Rice could hack together such a dull and disappointing effort. I feel guilty writing this, since apparently Merrick was medicinal for Anne during her hour of need, but she should have just tossed it in the garbage upon her recovery and spared the rest of us the pain of having to read it.Anne, please don't let this be the beginning of the end! We want the REAL YOU back!"
3,...,"I liked the book, it did what i want from a book; it took me to a whole different world.I like the way Mrs Rice writes and I'm a big fan off New Orleans and I think she at least tried to give a spin at the vampire chronicles..And yes, Merricks character may not have been fully developed but thats o.k..I have a feeling she will turn up in other novels..I can't wait"
4,Vampires meet a Witch?,"While this book was not the best in the series, it was however a good one. I just love Anne Rice's books. She is a master story teller, weaving a descriptive aura around her characters. Almost immediately I fall into her books, transported to another place, another life. With this book, it took a chapter or two to fall into place, and once it did... it was wonderful, as always.While Lestat seems to be Mrs. Rice's favorite character, it is Louis who entrances me the most and this book really brought him into his own. Merrick is an enticing character who brings new life into the ""family"" that Lestat, Louis, and David have created. She is a breathe of fresh air and excitement. After years of boredom, things look to get exciting again and I look forward with great anticipation to the next chapter in the story!"
4,New Orleans Voodoo,"Well she is at it again,....with a vengance. I must say that I enjoy Ann's vampire tales very much however, if you are strictly looking for the blood thirsty novels that are so appealing,..perhaps you should keep going. Ann did incoperate a bit of witchcraft to this book, yet being a FAN of NO I loved it. She still has such a wonderful flare for producing a true image in your mind it praticaly sets you into the sceen. We do see a bit of Louis in this one ( good supprise ) , and the character merrick is one with many quirks and at times can make you feel like your sitting next to this Voodoo grandma."
4,What's the problem people?,"I read this book faster than I have read anything else in my life. This was a wonderful a worthy addition to The Vampire Chronicles. As an Anne Rice fan I was very happy, however, as I Louis fan I wasn't so happy. Louis seemed to be painfully out of character, other than that, I found this novel to be quite enjoyable."
4,One of Rice's best books...,"This one of those books that just captivated you. It wasn't as good as Interview, of Queen, or even Tale of the Body Thief. But, I love the fact of bringing Claudia back. She is my fave, and I always wanted some justice done to her character just once more. I had to skip the parts where David was describing his young years with Merrick, only because I found it useless to the plot. I also wanted to get to the seance part. By the end, I felt as if David, Louis, Merrick, and of course, Lestat, were sitting right next to me reading the final fiction words of David. But, I'm only 14, so I always fantasize that the gang of vampires really exsist, and that Anne Rice is just a fake name. Overall, Merrick, is a fantastic book, but not deserving of 5 stars because the whole piece about David with Merrick in the old days. VAMPIRES EXSIST!"
3,The Rum Drinking Merrick,"This is my first time reading an Anne Rice book. It was OK once you got past the early years of Merrick and also David's history. I'm not one to read about vampires and witches. I don't know if I will read another one of her books, this is not my genre of reading. All-in-all it was a good read."
5,Heck of a read,"It's hard to say which is my favorite Rice novel. Certainly INTERVIEW comes to mind, a well as LASHER and THE WITCHING HOUR. But if I had to pick, MERRICK would probably take the prize.I think what throws most Rice fans off concerning this book is that it's not like her others. Well in some ways, obviously, but for me it had a differnt feel. The characters seemed more ""flesh and blood"" and while I didn't feel the dialogue was as good in this book as in INTERVIEW or LASHER, the overall effect of the novel was well beyond those two.Also recommended: Lasher, Grisham's The Firm, and Mccrae's Bark of the Dogwood"
4,Old friends and new,"As strong as Lestat's thirst for blood is mine for these books. I honestly cannot read enough. I bought and read this book in five hours. I could not put it down. Anne Rice does not fail to deliver her trademark colourful, descriptive prose. The characters in this, the sixth installment of the New Orleans vampires are just as vibrant and 3D as the first. We meet some for the first time but with most it is a reunion of sorts. My only quip is not really one at all as much as it is a suggestion for the future. How about a book all to Claudia. I'm sure I'm not the only fan who would love to hear her version of events."
2,I've seen this ending before.,"While I enjoyed pieces of this latest book, there were two things that Anne Rice could've done better.The first was that she brings up this whole ancient civilization in Central America that is ""Olmec or Maya, but neither."" We do not learn anything more about this mysterious culture that Merrick's ancestors came from, which I think could've been developed a little bit more.The second thing was the ending. She introduces a new character, in this case Merrick, and then turns them into a vampire at the book's end. In light of the fact that this happened in both ""Tale of the Body Thief"" and ""The Vampire Armand,"" its sad to say that Anne Rice is getting a bit too formulaic.If Anne Rice wants to come up with a good novel, she should explore the character of Gabrielle, Lestat's mother, who is also a vampire. She is only briefly featured in the earlier books and I think there's much more to be fleshed out there."
2,"It was okay, but...","I found myself not liking Merrick very much (which is too bad, because the book IS named after her). I just thought Merrick was too conniving. I did not really the ending, it was too strange. I can't really say much about it without giving it away, but to me it did not seem realistic. I did not like how Louis was portrayed, either. He seemed too...lame, for lack of a better word. This book certainly doesn't rate with the earlier books in the series."
3,"Rice's Best Since ""Servant of the Bones""","While certainly not as good as the older VC book, this is her best after Pandora, Armand and Vittorio.Full of some interesting surprises most notably at the end, this book opens doors to what are some potentially great future adventures."
2,No depth,"Fans of the Vampire Chronicles who are expecting to read about Lestat & Louis will be disappointed. There's too little of the beloved Louis and Lestat only turns up at the end of the story. The main part of the book is about Merrick, whom is likely the worst Anne Rice character to-date. Known for her beautiful prose, Anne Rice elaborated on Merrick's external features but the character obviously lacks the depths and dimensions that have made Rice's earlier characters - namely Lestat, Louis, Claudia and Armand lovable and adored by so many fans. I can see that Rice wants to bring new members into the 'Coven of the Articulate' but if doing so is the result of 'Merrick', then perhaps, returning to explore, nurture and develop her old characters would be a much better option. Fans have been dying for a chronicle from Lestat to tell more of his beloved Louis, Claudia and of his other encounters and adventures... Let's hope that's coming next."
2,Disappointing,I was disappointed with this latest by Anne Rice. I found myself just wanting to get through it so I could move on to something more interesting. I hope future books in this series will be better.
1,The straw that broke the camel's back,"I am a huge fan of the first three books of the Vampire Chronicals who has up to this point read everything penned by Anne Rice. However, after about 40 pages of this book, I have finally given up on her and her incredibly annoying writing style.I suffered through the other tales of the Mayfair Witches, though only because I was curious about Lasher and by the end of ""Taltos"" I swore off reading anything except Vampire stories. I was hoping beyond hope that this infusion of the Vampires into the world of the Witches would somehow improve the characters and mute her excessive use of detail; forgetting that with the exception of ""The Vampire Armand"", her new Vampire Chronicles (""Pandora"" & ""Vitorio"") have been disappointments as well.My suggestion: avoid the witches, read ""Interview..."", ""Lestat"", and ""Queen of the Damned"", then STOP. Reread as necessary."
1,"Same Old, Same Old","I was sadly diappointed with this latest effort by Rice. I wanted to like it, but with a precious few exceptions, this novel was so much like Rice's other recent ones I felt like I had spent my money on it foolishly. Maybe her son could have done it better?"
5,CLEVER,"Anne Rice showed true genius with this one. She brought characters from The Vampire Chronicles, and The Mayfair Witches. I urge the reader to read the Vampire Chronicles up to this point, and at least the first two (of the three) in the Mayfair series, just to get a feel for the characters. However, you only need to know the basics of the characters, and need no prior knowledge of the Mayfairs to enjoy this novel. Completely refreshing. Utterly invigorating! A must read!"
3,More Louis! Less David!,"...I was looking forward to the story of Merrick, a distant biracial cousin of the famous Mayfair Witches, who practices voudoun. I was looking forward to Louis's quest for the ghost of Claudia--but then I've always liked Louis. In this book, in fact, a lot of ineresting things happen to Louis--the Claudia thing, a new love, and a complete change of heart about how much vampiric power he wants. (I'll try not to commit a spoiler by telling any more details than that.) In other words, lots of character development.So, my major gripe with this book is that it isn't told from Louis's point of view, but David Talbot's. See, David has had a crush on Merrick since she was a teenager seeking refuge with the Talamasca. And while some of the interaction between David and Merrick is interesting, I would have preferred to cut a few of the chapters describing the infatuation, making room for more Louis-stuff. Fascinating things go on in this book--but we are only spectators."
4,Tantalizing!,"I am a really big Anne Rice fan. I've read all her vampire novels. Merrick, I have to admit, is not her greatest work by far. (Don't worry, the following isn't a ""spoiler"") The story begins with David Talbot asking Merrick to raise the ghost of Claudia for Louis. The book drags. Merrick eventually raises the ghost of Claudia...250 pages later. For that length of the story, David is telling Louis about the life of Merrick (Which is painfully boring). I won't tell you what happens after the 250 pages as I will spoil for you the only good part of the book. But I will tell you that what does happen is more than enough to redeem the novel. The book went from a 1 to about an 8 or a 9. So, to sum up my review, I recommend this book, if for nothing else but the last 100 or so pages."
3,3.5 stars,"I liked this book better than Interview with a Vampire. Not as graphic and better written. I rated it 3.5 to 3.75 stars. It's about Merrick searching out to contact the spirit of Claudia, the child. I liked the story Much Much better than Interview with a Vampire."
2,weak plot and characters,"Anne Rice has a nice writing style - very readable. But this book seemed uninspired. Characters were anemic and the story - well, there really wasn't one."
3,lifestyles of the rich & evil,"I am a huge fan. Some of these books represent important milestones in my spiritual journey, and I'm a sucker for the spooky hedonism and just all things Rice. While reading this I found myself bored with how predictably gorgeous, special, powerful, rich and lucky these characters are. The moral struggles seemed shallow. Consequences, agonies,revelations, dilemmas became trite as characters made exceptions and excuses and much was understood or forgiven. Such powerful scary evil situations, yet many resolved as easily as returning an impulse buy for a full refund. Let's pull our heroes out of the limo and into the mud."
3,Only read if you're a fan of both series.,"In the latest tale of the Vampires, Louis is consumed by an obsession to call the spirit of Claudia, so David seeks out a member of the Talamasca who might be capable of doing so. Even though we have not heard of her before, David shares a long history with Merrick, which he relates to us here. They even go on a trek through the South American Rainforest!This book seems more like a bridge between two tales than a story that can stand alone. One must be completely familiar with the characters and their history to really appreciate this adventure. It was worth reading, I think, if one intends to continue to read the chronicles, but not for its own merit. Ultimately, my opinion is ""meh."""
3,I did,..books like this run on reputation. Mayfair fans+ Vampire Chronicle fans makes a number one seller of course..
4,Diversity In New Orleans,"Merrick is my first attempt at a Rice novel. There will be more. The author employs a classic style with many similarities to Henry James. Most impressive are the characters, extraordinery monsters portrayed as sympathetic personalities with similar needs as you or I.Merrick, herself, is rich in ambiguity that leaves the reader guessing about her intentions. My only concern was some redundant dialog. When David is trying to convince someone of a point, he tends to be repetitive of his arguements. Since he is the narrator, the repetition comes in words and thoughts. This is a minor concern that is offset by wonderful settings, language and tension.I look forward to Merrick's impact on the her companions. A female perspective among the undead can only improve an already popular series."
2,Disappointing,"I was also disappointed in this latest book. I'd skipped over her last few novels. I was very surprised that in passages referring to ""Matthew"", Merrick's stepfather, the name ""Michael"" was used twice. Did I miss something? Is there a Michael or was this a misprint? Surprised to see this kind of mistake in an author of Ms. Rice's caliber."
2,not again...,not bad but when is the Anne Rice going to write a book that isn't exactly the same story as the rest?
1,A true embarrassment,"In literary studies, characters are often referred to as being either flat (remaining the same throughout the novel) or dynamic (changing emotionally/spiritually as the novel progresses). As later additions to the vampire novels demonstrate (""Merrick"" included), Anne Rice's vampire characters have for years been flat, flat, flat. Unless she plans to let them change and grow, she should stop writing about them. It's such a shame that she's constrained her characters - they had, and still have, fantastic potential. As far as the actual text is concerned, does no one take a blue pen to her work?? It's depressing when an author hacks off her own work, and it's even worse when she inaccurately hacks off her own work. Where is her editor? Well, at least we have two classics - ""Interview with the Vampire"" and ""The Vampire Lestat."""
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge Rice fan and I was really disappointed by this book. There were plenty of interesting elements in this story, but she didn't seem to bring them together. Possibly the frequent references to other books and storylines?The character of Merrick is an interesting addition to her lineup but I don't feel she capitalized on it.It is still worth reading if you are a Rice fan, but not by much."
2,First there was ANNE RICE ... then... there was anne rice,"Let's seperate Anne Rice into two people...The first writes books like Queen of the Damned and The Witching Hour. The second writes books like Vittorio and Merrick.The Rice I fell in love with wrote about characters with character. About love, violence, lust, anger, and soul. This new Rice obviously didn't read any of her former works and simply must supply 100,000 words to her publisher by the end of the quarter.Merrick is, in a word, boring. Remember in school when YOU had to write an essay and used ""filler"" words? ""The flowers were red. Bright red. So red, the color red was not sufficient to describe them"" Now picture an entire book like that. ""New Orleans with streets so vibrant the word vibrant isn't vibrant enough to capture it"". PLEASE! Anne...for all our sakes' STOP!"
5,"Side stepping from the main story - but, still good.",David Talbot goes to a young VooDoo witch for help while she ends up trying to seduce him and Louis.During this story Merrick saves Louis from the sun and becomes the very thing that David never wanted her to be.
3,Not her best work,"An interesting book, but not her best work. It is one of the weakest of her productions."
2,She should have written a book about the Elephant Man...,"Merrick is a bore. Both the person and the book. Mostly the person. Curious that the only interesting part of the novel is the ending (and I must admit I am looking forward to the sequel, just to see what will happen), promising a conflict between vampires and humans, which would seem hackneyed if written by any other author but seems brilliant from Anne RIce."
4,Way to go Anne Rice!,"This was a great read, the history, the tie in with the other chronicles. Ms. Rice uses words like artists use paint. Reading it late into the night I was with David, Merrick, Luis, and hoping Lestat would wake up and smell the coffee. It was like visting long-time friends and catching up on their goings on. I find I must now read Memmnoch the Devil because in a couple of places, when referring to Lestat and his adventure with the Devil, I felt I dropped into the middle of a conversation I had vague knowledge of."
3,Stay true to the original characters!,"Why would anyone want to get rid of the character, Louis? This is one of the most intriguing character in the VC, apart from Lestat, Armand and Claudia. These 'old characters' are the most charmings. Anne Rice should just focus on these few vampires instead of trying to intorduce too many other characters especially when they are not interesting at all. Ever wonder why and how Anne Rice become who she is today? It's because of her very first book, Interview with The Vampire, and maybe the next 2 chronicles."
3,A bridge between Rice's previous series and.....what?,"In terms of style and writing ""Merrick"" is up to Rice's usual high standards, and it is noteworthy in that it brings her vampires and witches (although not the ""main"" Mayfairs) together. But the plot reads like ""a day in the life"" of David, Louis, and Merrick (and Lestat, to a small degree) - until the last few chapters; then (as others have indicated) the story gets REALLY interesting. These last few chapters leave you begging for Rice's next book - and I hope it comes out soon.Unfortunately, except for those last few chapters, although the writing is excellent, the subject matter is very drab. It's the writing and style that gets this review its three stars."
4,A Setup for the Next Sequel,"I love Anne Rice and, after finishing her latest novel, I have officially read every word that she has ever published. Merrick is a wonderful addition to her Chronicles (Vampire or Witch). As usual Rice is meticulous in describing the scene, the characters, building suspense, and drawing the reader into the plot. Following her somewhat rambling plot, is sometimes a challenge, but a challenge worth the effort for this reaader. Yes, I loved the book, and yes I was disappointed when it ended, as I usually am. My one criticism is the same one I frequently have with her novels. Rice seems to reach a point when she tires of the story, or maybe she realizes she has her requisite 300 pages, so she just ends it. Her ending for Merrick seemed contrived, convenient, and most unlikely."
3,Average,"While I eagerly ran to get this book, thinking both Claudia and Louis would play large roles in it, I was soon to discover I was wrong. Instead I find the starring role being played by Merrick Mayfair. And while I expected her to play a large part in it, I wanted to see the characters I have come to love more. Instead, I find myself with this horrendously boring Merrick, whom I have learned to hate with a passion. While all in all this was a good book, and I do recommend it to all of The Vampire Chronicle fans, don't let your hopes be too high. You'll find her earlier works were much better."
3,David & Louis Revisited,"I have read all 20+ books written by Anne Rice and have enjoyed them all to varying degrees. One expects an author to have ups and downs in both quality and quantity. Unless prose is produced by a machine this is both understandable and expected.In Merrick Anne Rice has begun to develop a new character that is different from the others in that she is a witch. However, the story seems to me to be more about David Talbot than about Merrick Mayfair. What happened to all those years between childhood and womanhood? What did she do? Where did she do it? What influenced her development as a woman and a witch?Hopefully this character will be better developed in a future work since disappointingly it was not done here."
2,BORING WITCH!!!!!,"I really wish that this book was more interesting. Don't get me wrong, the beginning was interesting and the ending was a surprising twist, but the middle was completely BORING!!! I think that the change of pace was unbearable. Once Rice cued in on Merrick Mayfair's life, I actually skipped ahead to the end. I didn't miss anything (I forced myself to read the parts I skipped over). All I learned was that David Talbot was one pedophile of an old man! Merrick Mayfair's life was one of the most boring I've read. I would use another word for it, but ""boring"" is the best fit. If Rice would only keep the flow of the book constant and not drag out Merrick's life, I would give it a better rating. I have one question to put to everyone: what happened to the old Anne Rice? Her old books were much, much better. If you're thinking of reading her book for the first time, I suggest her early books up to Memnoch the Devil."
4,Fun reading!,I enjoyed reading this work by Anne Rice. I have read every book by Anne Rice (and own all but Interview with a Vampire in first edition) and found this to be at the top of the list. I enjoyed how the two story lines get blurred between the Mayfair Witches and the Vampire Cronicles but I would like to have seen more with the actual Mayfair family involvement-maybe she's holding out for a future book.
2,Louis fans will cry,"Those who love Louis for his flaws will cry. As with Memnoch the Devil and The Vampire Armand, the characters have the same name and the same looks but not the same soul. I didn't know these vampires. They were strangers to me. Anne did a complete 180-degree turn around on several key facets of Louis' personality. It was heartbreaking. The poor Beautiful One. New readers may like it, but those of us who loved Louis from the beginning weep.Also, this story should be told by Louis, not David. So much wasn't described because David wasn't there to witness it. He only heard about it after the fact. Therefore, much of the really important stuff happens ""off-screen"" and the reader misses out.If you are a fan of the romantic, sensual vampire, maybe it is time to move to Poppy C. Brite or T.Isilwath."
2,Let's hope Anne will do better than this ...,"I've been a fan of Anne Rice for almost a decade and the vampire chronicles from IWTV to MtD have been a treasured jewel. I was thrilled to hear about Merrick as it promised a return of our beloved Louis. And I believe like many fans out there, I have been waiting for some bizzare adventures of Louis and Lestat...and those ever-enduring romantic undertone. Disappointingly, Merrick reads like a normal (a word I've before this, refused to use on my fav. author) novel - Indiana Jones-like adventure, and worse, a too-unlike-Rice love triangle that seems all superficial! What happens to the Rice we love? Where are the mysteries, the love-hate, the struggles, the bitterness and sweetness .. I miss the misery, the haunting and those burning sensations I used to get when reading a vampire chronicle. Anne, please listen to your fans and oh, ... the editing of the book was terrible, if there was even one!!"
3,"A Brisk, Entertaining Read but definately a ""Lite"" Chronicle","Merrick, the latest in the Anne Rice ""Vampire Chronicles"", introduces the Mayfair witch clan to the world of Lestat, Louis and David Talbot. This was a well woven story and very entertaining but not up to the standard of the early chronicles (Interview with a Vampire/The Vampire Lestat). Having read The Witching Hour, Lasher and Taltos, I was well acquainted with the Mayfair witches and their rich history. Merrick is an intriguing character but I was hoping to find a deeper plot with more embellishment of her ""powers"". It seems to me that Merrick was written in the same vein as Rice's more recent Vampire Stories (Armand, Pandora, Vittorio). These books are imaginative and entertaining. However, they are not as compelling or full-bodied as the first four Vampire Chronicles and they merely provide background for these earlier chronicles. I think for the next release I'll wait for the paperback version ....."
5,Amazing,"The first two essays in this book not only give the reader fundamentals but expands on them. ""That Which Is Not Seen and That Which is Seen"" cautions men on their superficial economic notions of only looking at the direct effects of human action, instead of the indirect as well. ""The Law"" provides a look into the use of force, namely plunder, and how governments have engaged in legalized plunder.This book is much better than ""Economics In One Lesson"". Bastiat goes to greater lengths to show the reader, without a doubt, that he is correct in his thinking.I find the first two essays alone to be worth every penny."
3,"Perfect, except for one little detail...","I love '47 brand hats, and I have plenty. Though with this most recent one there is a small addition that was almost a deal breaker. There is now a prominent ""'47"" on the side of the hat. The picture doesn't depict it, but it is about the size of a dime, white, and embroidered. For a hat that is supposed to look simple and weathered; having a giant white logo on the side breaks that classic feel.LUCKILY, on a black hat, I simply took a black sharpie to the logo. It is still there, but not it looks like it is the same color as the hat. Hopefully in the future '47 either uses color matched embroidery or does away with the logo all together."
5,"Pro Back Quality Hat with ""lived in"" finish","the hat doesn't look like I just bought it because the fabric is gently brushed....logo looks good but not over stated....my daughter, in high school, wanted a more gangster looking hat so I had to get her a different one with the label on the billSize wise, I bought a medium and I usually wear a 7 to 7 1/8. It fits well."
2,Disapointment,"I don't know if Twins has just started making a new cut of their hats or if it's just Giants caps. I had previously ordered a Nationals hat at XL which fit like a dream. I figure it's the same company; same sizes. I order a XL in a Giants and it's huge. I then returned the XL, ordered a Large and...it's very tight. Overall, I am very unhappy about this product.I'd reccomend trying on this hat in person at a store and not ordering it on here."
3,Over priced itme !!!,"The cap is overpriced as it's really just any other SF Giants cap that I can buy here in SF for less than $20. Another thing, if only I knew the quality was like this (the cloth of the cap is too soft & it could have been better if the front part of the cap, behind the SF logo had a lining to make it a bit harder & look better, just like the rest of my cap collection).Thank you... Gil"
3,Giants Hat,"The hat is okay and priced according to market (although I think market's a little high on these hats). The problem is there is no hole in the back for a ponytail. I just assumed all baseball caps had this but now I know that's not true. I bought the hat for my 13 year old daughter, and she often has a ponytail, so she won't wear it as often as she would like. If you don't have to worry about ponytails, no problem."
1,I don't think it is well written and there are errors. Lots!,"Too many reviews that don't seem real to me. They all say what I can't find anywhere in this book.I don't find this easy to read, nor do I like the way he presents material. Especially subnetting.Simple typos, to glaring errors abound in this book, and if you are a new in the Cisco world, this is not a recommended book because you won't be able to tell which is right or wrong.The CD is nothing to consider when trying to find a study guide. Worthless simulation that makes you call a long distance call to register before it will open, then when it does open, you find it wasn't worth your call, because to perform any needed labs, you need to enter your credit card! YUP, you read that right, you must pay to use any labs that are worth while.I thought I spent enough on this book already, but nope, you need to pay more.Stick with Cisco press and Sybex. This just proves to me why I always stick to the orginals."
3,for the beginner,this book covers a bit too much for the seasoned network tech looking to study up for an exam. My advice save your money and get test king.
3,Detailed but not sufficient to pass in first attempt,"I used this book, and did the tests extensively, as advised by the author.The book is not sufficient to help you pass the exam. I did not.The exam's questions are a good deal more complex than the ones in the book.Test takers: please supplement this book with additional materials. I know I'll do the same when I take the exam again."
4,IMPRESSIVE!!!,"4.5 stars. Over the course of all eight tracks the guitar melodies and outright grooving are nothing less than impressive. While this album is certainly not a masterpiece, it is an exceptional and well-rounded CD loaded with memorable music front-to-back. For newcomers to the finely tuned world that is Old Man's Child, I heartily recommend ""In Defiance of Existence"" as a first purchase. I am addicted to this band and I hope they stay around for many more great albums; not the least of which is ""The Pagan Prosperity."""
2,Black metal?,"This is not black metal.this is 'all cd long the same speed' metal with some keyboards and,i admit,a black metal voice.Besides,Galder is a very arrogant man.Only 2 times listening is enough. Okay, there are 2 or 3 interesting songs.But it all sounds so much the same!!Good metal album, BAD BLACK metal album."
2,Okay if you're a kid I guess,"A little more zany than I expected. I think the idea for the movie was a good one, but they went a bit over the top with it and in my eyes made what could have been a good movie ended up being just plain stupid. I can see kids liking it, but adults beware. Not even Anne Archer and Brian Dennehy could save this one."
4,A little odd.,"If you lust for Lovecraft movies, get it. It is done like a silent film, it is not a cartoon as the cover art suggests. Is it good, yeah. Does it hold weight to the masterpieces that were the original stories, no."
1,Very Disappointing...,"Hmm...a Call of Cthulhu silent film. Sounds interesting. Sounds like everyone loves it..It just isn't very good. I was more or less in agony watching it and by the end I actually felt a bit ripped off after it was over.It's just so low budget and it just plain doesn't work. Cthulhu in particular was disappointing. The whole film felt like a sort of ""test film"" to show investors...not a finished product."
5,Must-See for Lovecraft Fans,"I bought this with some reservations... after all, how good could a silent version really be? The answer I give now is ""exceptionally good""!""The Call of Cthulhu"" is unquestionably the most faithful adaptation of Lovecraft's work to date, and very effectively conveys the weirdness and horror of the story. The choice of making this a silent film was inspired, and suits the tale perfectly. I especially enjoyed the third act, which eschews intertitles entirely in revealing the terrible fate of the Emma's crew. The music and silent acting in this sequence is the best of the film, and even the titular terror himself is wonderfully realized and surprisingly effective.If you're on the fence about this because it is silent, don't be. This outshines any other Mythos adaptation you've seen. ""The Call of Cthulhu"" is a marvelous film, and I recommend it highly."
5,Best Lovecraft Film Ever,This is by far the best film adaptation of Lovecraft's fiction I've ever seen. It's done in the manner of black & white silent films but with better quality than that era could manage. The story was stuck to religiously and nothing was added for profit motive. My only suggestion would be to put two stories per disc since they're short. That might help more people than just hardcore Lovecraft fans decide to buy them.
3,It pains me to say this...,"Its obvious from the very first frame that the filmmakers revere Lovecraft, and they went to great lengths to deliver a product that is true to his spirit. I really want to root for them, that's why I'm reluctant to say anything negative about this product.The good news: this is the most faithful adaption of a Lovecraft story that I've ever seen. Its even more impressive given the limited budget that the filmakers had to work with.The bad news: Cthulhu himself. The stop motion model at the end, which I waited through the entire movie for, was a major disappointment. It looked amatuerish, phony, and not at all convincing. Sorry, but that's the truth. I know they wanted to use technology that would have been available in the silent era, and I can respect that, but all that ultimately matters, in my opinion, is the image that ends up on screen. They should have hired an experienced CGI artist."
2,silent movie with subtitles,"I just wanted to give viewers a heads-up. This is a silent movie with subtitles. Unfortunately, subtitles give me headaches. I couldn't watch this movie because of the headache, but there are five other reviews at this time from people who did (I assume). Four of them gave it a good rating, one didn't. If subtitles makes a difference to you, I'm glad to provide the information."
1,amateurish effort best avoided,"Speaking as a long-time silent film enthusiast and collector as well as a Lovecraft fan, I agree with the 1-star by a Mr Davis that the result is amateurish. In fact he's being polite. It's downright bad. Furthermore, it wouldn't even be a good student project. At least not if the student had any delusions of getting a passing grade. The idea is good but it needs to be done by people with talent, something this effort wasn't."
1,Claymation Cthulhu? Booooo....,"If this was some kids senior project for his first film class maybe I'd have some sympathy. But if you're going to do one of the greatest monsters ever conceived you better have some real payoff monster scenes. This has this weak, super choppy, barely lit claymation Cthulhu at the end and it sucks. SUCKS. If you're dying to see it, just check it out on youtube before you waste 45 minutes of your life. I just don't get why this story never gets made the way it deserves. Remember that octopus monster that attacks Frodo in LOTR? That's as close to Cthulhu as movies have gotten, and even that is nowhere near as cool as the story. Benecio Del Toro, if you're reading this, screw making the Hobbit, and get New Line working on a decent film version of Cthulhu."
5,The Call of Cthulhu: The Celebrated Story by H. P. Lovecraft,"This was so good I only wish the feature was longer and the DVD had even more special features! Really a wonderful presentation in every way, and my highest recommendation to those who are into the horror genre and/or the works of H. P. Lovecraft."
5,Simply Incredible ! A MUST HAVE for Lovecraft Fans,"This movie is simply amazing. Lovecraft wrote this story in the '20's when B&W; silent films were common, so it only makes sense that his classic tale would be told in this way... It achieves it's goal of communicating a VERY ""unfilmable"" story into a cohesive, well structured film that absolutely 110% captures Lovecraft's vision. I can only imagine what kind mind torturing film this would have been if Hollywood had been involved, made it color, added 10,000 digital effects, etc.... it would SUCK so hard, the theaters would develop black-holes! Being a silent film works SO well in this movie because, in the story, there isn't alot of dialogue - it's all imagery and impressions.This is a MUST HAVE for any fan of Lovecraft. You won't be disappointed. I hope there are many more films to come that are as well done as ""Call"" and that can capture his complicated stories so elegantly."
3,Call of Cthulhu,"Like a lot of people, I discovered this story through the video game on Xbox. For a modern day silent film it is actually pretty good. I have a few of the classic silent films and I would say this definitely compares. I was surprised that they actually made it seem like a flick made in the 1920's. Cool little movie. Not very long, well, not your standard hour and a halfish, but good non the less."
3,Cthulhu calling dahling....,"It was OK. I rate this as a pretty good student film project. Try to find it used, I'm sure there are plenty in this catagory."
2,Fan Noise is very disturbing,"This is an Excelent Machine with High Def capabilities, but the built in FAN noise is making me go mad."
3,Power pop from cartoon characters?,"I love power pop and I am always seeking new groups. I know nothing about this group since there is a loose effort of creating a cartoon mystique. I guess if I dig out the liner notes and do some research I can learn more.The sounds are jangly guitars, with hues of A.M. bubblegum, ""Teen Beat"" yearning vocals (the vocals can tend to be a bit wimpy) and occasional flashes of muscular guitar crunch. It's a derivative sound with no groundbreaking going on here. While not a masterpiece, there are some catch tunes here.""Hey Now"",""Build this House"", Cathy's back"" and ""Knife"" are the highlights"
1,Not what it seems,"I ordered this ring for my daughter for Christmas. The description of this ring is wrong. There is no diamond in this ring. I was very disapointed when I received this ring as it is very ""chunky"" and it does not seem to be sized correctly. I ordered a size 7 (my duaghters normal ring size) and it is way to large. She took it to several places to have it re-sized and no one will do it because of the metal it is made of. I would like to return the ring but it does not seem like I am able to. If you are interested in ordering this ring - be careful!"
5,Great for hardwood floors,Purchased a music stand years ago and did not know about these. We have hardwood floors and the stand has never scratched the floor but know my son can slide the stand without worry. They blend in so well and add to the appearance of the stand. Would definately reccomend to anyone with a stand.
5,Vinegar is good,Vinegar has been overlooked for too long as a medical tool for many ills of man. This book belongs in every household for it's value. Bought on Amazon!!!!
2,Good info,"Good info, but the book is too wordy and poorly written. Should be half the size and half the price."
2,Vinegar is good but this book is a waste of money,"I am not going to dispute claims about health benefits of vinegar. I believe there are many. My negative review is about the book.There is only enough information in this book to fill an article, a brochure maybe, not a lengthy publication. Was the author paid by the word?"
5,"If you love to use natural remedies, this is a must read!","I acquuired a copy of Dr. Jarvis' ""Folk Medicine"" more than 40 years ago, which is mainly about the uses and cures of Apple Cider Vinegar and honey. This new book, ""The Healing Powers of Vinegar"" expands on the health and nutrition values of Apple Cider Vinegar and is an important addition to any health library."
4,Good Stuff,"I was somewhat already ahead of the game. I knew that Apple Cider Vinega and Honey were good for you. However, I was not aware of all the other cider products that were very possibly good for you also. Therefore, I found the book to be informative."
2,"Long on words, little on content","This ""reference"" for the qualities of vinegar is the obvious product of a journalist, not a specialist in the topic. While there is a bit of good information contained within, you have to plow through a LOT of text to retrieve it. Also, no index to find various specific recipes makes that section such a pain to use as to be worthless. Overall, a disappointment."
2,Disappointing,This is just a jumbled presentation about vinegar... with a little of this and that. There are much better books on the healing benefits and uses of vinegar than this one.
2,ugh!,"Too complex, too much reading - was looking for something less detailed and 'lite' If you want to sit down and read a novel about Vinegar, I am sure it is great but it is more than I was looking for."
2,NOT REALLY GOOD,This book is not at all what I thought it would be. I didnt really order the book when I bought the vita bathe it got hooked on to the order some kind of way.. I am sending the book back not worth the price and plus shipping...
2,Waste of money,"Judging by the copyright this is the edition I bought here at Amazon back in Sept. 2008 , waste of money if you're after medicinal information.. You'll get a history of vinegar ( the best part of the book), and a bunch of testimonials not much better than "" I drank some vinegar and it helped me"". I was actually hoping for some recipes for assorted ailments, didn't get my money's worth with this thing- it was almost completely useless, my copy is stuck off in a box in storage somewhere it's so useless."
5,great reading,This is an excellent book. I am already using some of the ideas and already feel the difference in my health.
2,Find a different book on vinegar,"This book could be about 1/10 the size. She repeats information over and over again. I find myself skipping huge sections of the book because she already said it in the previous paragragh. There's also not much scientific evidence. Most of what she says are just educated guesses. Now, I'm not undermining the power of vinegar, I think its great stuff, and she does explain each vinegar and whats ""supposbily"" in it and how what aliment its ""supposed"" to cure. Some of it doesn't even make sense for example read this exact sentence...""The results of 33 studies showed the potassium lowers blood pressure in patients with hypertension, and it can also help prevent hypertension by lower blood pressure."" Do ya see the problem here...lol"
4,Good Information for all to know,"This is a quick read book, factual, interesting, and even challenging. Constains good advise for every day ailments that I may have heard before but needed to be reminded again. I have used a daily routine of vinegar before but fell off the wagon. It did make me feel better as I recall, so I think I'll try it again.Bob's Girl"
4,Good Information,"I read the book about the value of using vinegar. Its worth the price, and some of the remedies I've used in the past. Although I noticed that a lot of the information was repeated through out the chapters. Other than that, I thought the book was good."
5,Great uses for Vinegar,I liked this bok because it showed some great uses for Vinegar that I didn't know about.
2,Title deceptive,"This book is much too wordy and about much more than the healing power of vinegar. When ""healing"" is what you are looking for - that can be rather frustrating."
2,I didn't like this book at all!,"I bought this book back in 2008, thumbed through it- and stuck it in a box someplace, very displeased with it. I remember it more for a history of vinegar than for any actual ""healing"" value. As I recall the cures consisted more of "" Mary G writes that a mixture of vinegar and ....... worked on....."" & so on. I don't even remember what the ""cures"" were for. Of all the Vinegar books Amazon has something must be worthwhile, this one wasn't worth the money to me. I wasn't expecting a cancer cure, this one wasn't much good for even common ailments."
2,Returned to the store in just a few hours...,"If your looking for one of the top five poorly built portable DVD player then look no further because this unit definitely qualifies. The first unit I purchased was defective brand new out of the box. You would think I would get that as my first clue that this brand is not too keen on quality control. However, I returned the first unit and purchased a second unit. Yes, this one worked but the quality of picture and sound was abysmal. I have heard better sound from a $5 alarm clock and sadly I'm not joking. In any event, do yourself a favor and don't bother with this one. The second Cyberhome unit is going back tomorrow and will be replaced by something other than one of the many brands that are made in china."
1,A Lemon of a DVD player,"I recieved my Cyberhome DVD player as a gift from my parent for Christmas. We did not own a DVD up until that time, and i was very excited about it. My parents also gave me Shrek. AS soon as i had figured out what to do, i put the dvd in, expecting to see a movie. But, it said loading like it wa supposed to, but then in said that there was an error on the DVD. Later, at my uncles house, i tried MIB II, and it worked perfectly, as well as Princess Diaries, but Finding Nemo would not work. I was fed up with the thing, so we sent it back and I recieved a Mintek DVD player that works like a dream."
2,Cyberhome DVD player,"Dont buy. I had it 2 months when it stopped working. Its the plug when you insert the power. Its broken, and the battery will not charge, it looks like the other connectors (video) are broken too. Very cheap"
1,TOTAL CRAP,"I BOUGHT THIS PLAYER BECAUSE MY BROTHER HAS ONE AND IT SEEMED LIKE A REALLY NICE PLAYER. HOWEVER, LIKE THE OTHER USERS, MY BATTERY WAS TOTAL CRAP AT 50% POWER AND WOULD NOT TURN ON AT ALL! I SENT IT BACK TO THE STORE RIGHT AWAY! DON'T BUY IF YOU ARE SMART!"
2,THOUGHT I got a great deal! Ha!,"When I saw this for $99 at K-Mart last year, I thought I had found the answer to our almost-1-year-old son's hatred of car trips. It felt pretty cheap & flimsy, but worked well, and played everything we put in it (even library DVDs that were pretty beat up), but the power cord connection was ALWAYS loose. Then about 3 months ago, it quit working completely--the AC adaptor didn't work, the battery charger didn't work, nothing. Luckily, my brother-in-law is an electronics wiz, and he was able to get it working again in about 5 hours of fiddling (and I didn't have to pay the $59 repair fee--plus shipping--Cyberhome quoted). However, our last car trip last week was IT. Every time we went over a tiny bump in the road, the cord fell out. I'm looking for a new DVD player again!`"
2,Wish we would have chosen a different brand,"We left all our cords and adapter on an airplane and they couldn't find them, so we tried to find a new adapter to hook it up in the car and no place around had one that would fit. Lots of places sold some that fit most DVD players but not this one. So we went to the Cyberhome webiste and with shipping it cost $55 just for the one adapter, I felt that was rediculously over priced. The average price of the adapter that fit most other DVD players was only $15. Next time we get a DVD player I will makes sure we can easily find new accessories to fit it so we don't have to spend a fortune."
1,Crap,"First unit I bought wouldn't read any DVD I tried. Exchanged it for another one. The second one plays the DVD however the sound cuts in and out. Also, the battery will not accept a charge. The unit won't play using battery power. I give up. I'll try another brand."
1,This is a piece of junk,"I bought this machine less then a year ago and up until my problem, probably would of given it a better rating until my husband went to use it about 7 month into it, he started to open it heard a little grinding in the hinges, it got stuck he continued to open it and the hinges just broke. It is a cheaply made product. but it only gets better folks. Emailed the company they said sent it back and as long as it was within a year, they would replace or repair free of charge. Gross misrepresentation. Get a call from them telling me it would cost me $90 to have a new machine because the item had to of been dropped. wrong just a piece of junk. Sorry so long just want people to watch what they buy, my friend always says, buy cheap, buy twice. and it sure is the case with CyberHome."
2,Unpredictable,"Great picture, but need to use headphones when traveling. A few problems with the screen working consistently and Cyberhome customer service has not been good to work with."
4,For your information,"For those who has bought this unit, potentially, you can make it region free. Here is the code:1. Turn on the player.2. Open the tray.3. Press Stop.4. Enter 1, 9, 9, 9 in order, and one at a time.5. You should now be in a hidden menu. You can change region code to all, but not disable Macrovision"
5,GREAT DEAL+SUPER PERFORMANCE=HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,"PURCHASED THIS UNIT THRU WALLMART FOR $218.00 COMPLETE WITH ALL THE CABLES,CASE,CAR MOUNTS,CABLES,BATT,CHARGER,HEADPHONES. THIS IS A PROGRESIVE SCAN PLAYER. THIS UNIT CAN TAKE VIDEO IN OR OUT. MOST CAN NOT. SUPER GREAT PICTURE. EASY TO OPERATE=I NEVER READ THE MANUAL. SUPER BRITE EVEN IN THE SUNLITE DRIVEING IN A CAR. SOUND IS VERY LOUD IF YOU SET UP THE MENUE PROPERLY. DEPENDS ON YOUR SOURCE. PLAYS EVERYTHING I PUT IN IT. I AM A HAPPY CAMPER. WALLMART ALSO SELLS AN ADDITIONAL 2 or 3 YEAR WARR FOR $28.00. UNCONDITIONAL EVEN NORMAL WEAR IS COVERED. SO THIS IS THE BEST DEAL I COULD FIND. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO PURCHASE. GET THE EXTENDED 2 YEAR WARR ALSO=$28.00 TOTAL COVERAGE. ITS WORTH THE EXTRA BUCKS."
2,Works for a few days..........,"The DVD player works fine if you do not mind it starting over again and again every time you try to move the player or press fast forward or any other button - this causes the player to READ the disk again which starts the movie over from the beginning. Also the player has a short where the plug for the car adapter and battery adapter plug in. IT IS NOT A CORD SHORT - IT IS A SHORT ON THE INSIDE OF THE PLAYER where the AC/DC adapter goes into the player. This renders the player useless. As I have read, I am not the only person with this problem. Unfortunately I have read reviews for several other players here and at other retailers and do not see any portable DVD players that have wonderful reviews so I may hang on to my money for a while to see if the industry improves this device."
2,Had to return item within 15 days of purchase,"It bought this item from radio shack (not Amazon), but it is the same exact item...so I wanted to comment on it.The picture looked clear, the sound pretty clear, I liked the way it looked and felt (weight) and the battery-life was pretty accurate. I might have gotten a faulty-item, but the screen kept going black above 20 minutes into the DVD. And if you put it in the straight position (to mount into your car carrer) it completely shuts itself off. I have two children and they were extremely upset to have the DVD Player stop working 20 minutes into a movie. Thank goodness I bought this item 1 month before our vacation (We are driving in my minivan to WDW, which is about 1100 miles away)!I am going to return it, but request a different item."
2,Send it BACK,"Currently own a Panasonic LV75 (7"" portable, cost $650 three years ago!). Needed another portable DVD player for the other kid for the long plane ride.$280 is a great price. PROBLEMs with the unit make it almost unusabe. I returned it.1) Quality of 7"" display - had to be right in front of the thing to see it. Image gets darker as you move off center.2) Battery is crap. Had to charge it for 5 hours to run for 100minutes. A far cry from the sales claim of 4.5 hours.3) At 50% battery or less, the unit would NOT turn on nless plugged in!!@#@4) Sound. Sound is low quality and max volume is 30. Had to set volume to 20 to hear it with nothing else in a quiet house.5) Controls for brightness are inconsistent with the rest.There are better choices. Pay the extra $75 or $125 and get a better unit made by someone else. The Panasonic may look alot like the CyberHome byt is 4x the quality."
2,Find something better,"Bought this unit for our child to watch during a road trip from Georgia to Washington DC. We had LOTS of problems with it skipping. Seems the slightest bump in the road made the thing skip. Picture froze a few times also. Tried several different DVD's, same results. Also, I didn't think the picture was bright enought when used in a car. Would not recommend this unit for use in a vehicle. We returned our unit for a refund."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!,it's a great product that will keep you sitting there watching it for hours!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Not worth the low price,"Although this unit may appear to be the best value available, I would not reccommend it. I bought it without reading any reviews on it's performance. In the package was every accessory one would want and need to enjoy a portable unit. The picture quality was very good - however, the sound quality from the built-in speakers was worse than an old $5.00 mono AM radio. You can just hear it at full volume and it sounds like radio static. (Unfortunately, I read this on many of the internet buyer reviews after I made the purchase. I returned it for an Audiovox unit which was the same price, but with less accessories. The audiovox sounded fantastic and feels like it will hold up much longer than the Cyberhome. The controls and housing of the cyberhome felt very cheap and fragile, while the audiovox felt like it can be used by younger children without easily breaking."
2,Not so Great for the $$,"I got this CyberHome brand portable DVD player and it was pretty cheaply made..returned it and looked for awhile and got the Toshiba SDP-1600 and it rocks! The battery pack on the Toshiba attaches at the back and some people don't like that it ""sticks out""...but I'v never had a problem with this at all.. The Toshiba has held up for over 4 years now! Don't get the Cyber home...look online and you can get a Toshiba for same price. ($150)"
1,Lasted 9 months,Our Cyberhome DVD player is now dead after only using it for 9 months. It won't turn on at all -- with or without the battery. My twins used it in the car and always complained that they couldn't see the movie unless they were practically sitting on one another. Also the sound was very low even at the highest setting. About a week before it died one speaker blew. We paid a lot for it and expected it to last a least a couple of years!
3,Attractive but not sized just right.,"I got a queen size set of Tommy Hilfiger jersey sheets for my bed. They were this lovely bright green color and just felt like cotton heaven.I purchased them, washed them (everything gets washed first in my house, everything), and went to put them on the bed as soon as I could. I was so excited! I love sheets, different colors and textures.Well, the color still looked terrific, but I had to almost kill myself to get these to fit my bed. I don't have an especially big mattress, just a regular queen (not high profile). But I had to pull and pull and pull to stretch the sheets enough to fit around all four corners.They stayed on okay (no zinging off the bed, thank goodness), but I don't look forward to the next time I try putting them on the bed. I am very disappointed."
3,Not very pleased,"I purchased these sheets for a twin extra long bed. After washing, I had to pull and stretch the material to capacity to get the corners over the bed. The three star rating is because the material is very good - soft and obviously strong! This item should not be advertised for extra long - it is NOT."
1,Hilfer Cotton Sheets,"If I could have given this a ZERO rating, I would have. I bought these sheets because they were ""deep pocket"" sheets. They have shrunk and no longer fit my bed."
5,Love the sheets,The sheets are just what I was looking for. The delivery time was good. Am very happy with my purchase.
5,jersey sheets,These sheets are great. Super soft and the best Jersey Sheets I have owned. Plus the prices for them are better than other jersey sheets of less quality. Great and comfy buy!
5,Wow,Great collection of classic recordings from Chess Records. Ike Turner is truly the most underappreciated man in rock and roll history.
4,Ike Turner,"Ike Turner, a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, is credited by many rock historians with making the first rock 'n' roll record, ""Rocket 88,"" in 1951. Produced by the legendary Sam Phillips, it was groundbreaking for its use of distorted electric guitar."
2,Question - read or audio only?,Is this an audio only book or can it be read on a Kindle? The book description is very vague on this point and I do not want to spend $23 on something I have to listen to.Thanks
1,"2 x-3 units, both failed","I have now purhcased two Francis x-3 units and both have failed. The first unit blew-up where the brass pipe goes into the pressure tank, yes, it literally blew-up there and destroyed the unit. This happned on the fith use of the unit. The second unitl worked perfectly for 6 months, noow it too has failed. It does not heat up and a seal appears to be broke and the unit will not reach brewing or steaming temperature. For a $600 Espresso machine, this is rediculous! I would advise anyone against buying one of these machines."
1,Poor quality,"I generally like Vermont American products, but these are the exception. First bit I used dulled after three minor uses. A couple other bits, smaller, broke in two. The final blow was when a 1/2 inch bit broke clean in half while drilling through metal stock using a hand held rechargeable drill! I have never had a 1/2 inch bit break, much less when using a relatively low powered drill. Sending them back."
2,"I agree, too much name dropping","While this book has some good recipes and quotes, the stories that Freeman tells of her friends are not what I was looking for. It would be interesting to read about different types of friendships, not one woman's account of going to the movies with so-and-so and every detail that happened. I was disappointed."
5,A GREAT book about friendship!,"I LOVED this book! It was funny, heart-warming and refreshing. I couldn't put it down. I loaned it to a friend who read it cover to cover and returned it in less than a week!Becky Freeman is a REAL mom with lots of stories to share that every woman can relate to and laugh with. She has a wonderful sense of humor about herself and her hilarious situations. Yet, she is inspiring in many ways. This is the fourth book I have read from this author and I am collecting as many as I can--as fast as I can!"
4,Back to basics,"The World Saxophone Quartet began as, well, a saxophone quartet, but changed the formula in 90's with percussion, drummers, a rhythm section, and singing. In addition, Julius Hemphill's passing led to a few different people taking his chair, but John Purcell seemed to be a keeper (at least from 1996 to 2002). ""New Chapter"" is just the quartet, without any other instruments. ""Suki Suki Now"" starts the disc in a brassy, funky fashion. From there, the rest of the songs hit the common WSQ notes -- free, stately, hymnlike, groovy, and brassy (not all at the same time). The difference between the ""New Chapter"" and earlier WSQ discs like ""W. S. Q."" or ""Revue"" is that the newer songs are more likely to come at you from an angle. Though some of the songs are easy to get, some still require closer listener, especially the episodic title track. I wouldn't call this disc essential, but WSQ fans should buy it."
3,"Good instruction, but slow-paced","Her DVD contains immense information about yoga, spirituality, getting in touch with your body & spirit & proper breathing in other menu options & in the beginning of the 4 25-min workouts.She has a great voice, very patient, she tells you in the begining of each pose the proper form, what to watch out for to avoid injury, some modifcations & when to breathe, but during the poses thre's a lot of silence & some moving postures, you don't know if she moved or not. wish she would also tell you benefits during, but does not.The way she teaches is like a classroom, each pose is like a new lesson, no fluidity. The music is very soft, barely hear it though it's beautiful. What bothered me pesonally is that they are the same songs from a favotire mind/body workout ""Tantric Toning.""This is great for beginners who like precise instruction & silence during each pose.There's trailers at askyogimarlon com"
2,Not for Absolute Beginners,"This instruction was far too advanced for ""absolute beginners."" I had tried a yoga video years ago that was too advanced, so I bought this video because of the title (and it was inexpensive). While the Marlon's verbal instruction was good, the lesson went far too quickly. Each time I looked up at the TV, I was further behind than the last time. If more time would have been spent on each pose, I may have given this a better rating. With the lesson being so quick, I lost interest...quick."
2,Poor Quality DVD,"My biggest complain with this DVD is the quality. I can't belive it was released in 2004. It really looks like something from the 80's. Yogi Marlon seems like a genuinely warm person, who is competent in her practice of yoga. But, the DVD totally detracts from that. I bought this DVD to replace a VHS tape I had of Yoga Journal's Yoga Inroduction with Patricia Walden because my VCR finally gave out. I thought the VHS was OK. It served it's purpose very well, and was excellent for beginners. I was hoping this new DVD would be easy enough for my 3 boys (ages 11, 12 & 13) to follow but they get distracted by some of the things she says, and the sort of ""subliminal images"" in one of the sections. Also, at times, it seems that she talks a lot, without really giving much instruction. So, maybe this DVD is just not for us. Its a shame."
3,Would Like To Wear Outside,"I bought these crib caps but wish they were also able to be worn outside. They are very stylish but everytime I take my son out the door while wearing it, a demon appears infront of me and forces me to return inside until I remove the cap. It's crazy! I just wonder if they will ever make these same crib caps but in an outdoor version."
5,Learn from the best,It is certainly worthwhile to study these wonderful games in depth if you are a serious chess player. It's too much for me to try & memorize them all but I try to capture Alekhine's main ideas by putting these games into Fritz 11 and studing them. I hope to gain higher rating points by my efforts. Alekhine was a better chess player than I'll ever be but maybe some of his ideas will help my OTB play.Datrryl Woodson
3,redline fuel injector cleaner,"This will help vehicle run little bit smoother, by cleaning fuel injectors. Its best of the fuel injector cleaners. However it will not solve major drivability problems. It will not replace a mechanic (it won't diagnose& take out/put new parts for your vehicle). I used it to delay changing fuel injectors but its runs smoother with a new one."
1,Rating low because I was looking in the wrong place,"The first song I heard by Katatonia was ""Day"". It is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard! I HAD to get this Brave Murder Day album after hearing that song. Wow, was I ever surprised when I got it. The album is much harsher than I expected - which is totally my fault. I had assumed the other tracks would be somewhat similar in sound. When, in fact, there were no other similar tracks.My hope is that they release an album full of melodies of the likes of ""Day"" for wusies like me."
4,Beautifully sad album,"This is the earliest work of Katatonia that I have been able to get my hands on and in my opinion it's one of their best.Although the compositions are far more simple, the overall sound of this album is somewhat similar to Opeth's debut ""Orchid"" especially the lead guitar. Add to this Mikael Akerfeldt's vocals annd this is certainly an album that should appeal to fans of that band.This is a very melancholy album (something which applies to every Katatonia album actually) and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like sad music. Some of the lead guitar is just beautiful and again is remniscent of Opeth's first two albums.Overall, an album that I would highly recommend."
3,A sad day,"Dance of December Souls was my favorite album for over a year, and I couldn't wait to hear Katatonia's new one. When I got it, I was extremely disappointed. They have simplified everything, leaving plain, repetative, and boring songs. People always talk about how their music is so depressing. I will agree with that here. I was very depressed that such an awesome band changed their style to such a monotonous boring sound. It seems like a lot of people like this though, so listen to some samples before you buy. The only redeeming factor of this release to me is ""For funerals to come"". This is just as good, if not better, than DoDS, although shorter. If you liked DODS, this is a worthwhile release to get just for FFtC. Unfortunately, you'll have to fast forward through six nasty songs to get there."
4,Slightly Confusing But Still Worth Seeing,"THE MAN I LOVE is hurt by having too many subplots going on at once. As a consequence the viewer is apt to get bogged down just trying to keep the various threads straight. However, there are still good reasons to see the film. Ida Lupino is superb in her role as a motherly older sister and night club torch singer. The thoroughly competent cast is another reason. It includes Robert Alda, Andrea King, Bruce Bennett, Martha Vickers and Craig Stevens.The music by George Gershwin, Jerome Kern and Johnny Green is excellent. It may not be the best effort by director Raoul Walsh but the touch of his genius can always be felt in any of his movies.Raoul Walsh reportedly appreciated Ida Lupino because of her no nonsense approach to acting. She never came to the set with a lot of extra agendas."
3,Strong and interesting movie,"I'm in agreement with the other reviews that have been posted here. One point I'd like to add to them is that the person who designed the graphic for the VHS cassette box should be hung up by his toes and flogged. The picture makes it look like an ""I Love Lucy"" episode, and that's as far as can be from an accurate characterization of the movie. The Ida Lupino character is one tough cookie. At one point she stands up to an armed and hysterical man who's intent on shooting her companion; she shoves him against a wall and slaps him forehand and backhand until he crumples to the floor sobbing. I don't think Lucille Ball hardly ever did that. :-)I've seen this movie described as a ""noir chick film,"" and that's accurate. It gets a little soapy in its profusion of subplots, but overall it's a strong and interesting movie with an intriguing lead character who may change your notions of how women could be portrayed in the late '40s."
4,Healing and Uplifting,"I have just experienced a personal tragedy in my life - God has been using the music off this CD to heal hurts in my heart. Delirious is lyrically honest and upfront. Musically, I enjoy the CD also. As always, a true worship experience. #10 Intimate Stranger is a beautiful song ... and how true it is. Thanks to God for using these musicians to bless our hearts and lives."
4,"Not quite Praise & Worship, But great stuff!","Although I'm a fan, this album was being promoted as the follow up to ""Cutting Edge"". Sorry, but I just don't see it. I do enjoy the album, but it isn't in the same genre as ""Cutting Edge"". As a worship leader, I've used somewhere around ten of the songs from ""Cutting Edge"" in congregational worship. Martin Smith is an amazing songwriter and worshipper... I was just hoping for some more great worship material, and didn't get it. If you like ""Mezzamorphis"" and ""King Of Fools"", (and I do by the way) you will like this as well! Just don't expect songs like ""I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever"", ""I've Found Jesus"" and ""Find Me In The River""."
1,eeewwww,"There was only one song on this entire album that was even half way decent. The only good one was "" My Glorious"". The rest of the cd really sucked twinkies big time."
5,Ranks among top 10 christian albums ever,This is just incredible.It has been in my cd player for 2 straight weeks.Investigate is the song of this cd- it is an epic-Reed Watson
4,A stunning example of how good electronic music can be,"Taking a slight departure from last year's ""The West"" Matmos takes their love of electronic collage a step further. Taking field recordings of various kinds of surgery(liposuction,eye surgery) and sampling and processing the sounds to make beats and abstract sound scapes is brilliant. This album makes a stunning example of how good electronic music can be. I would recommend this album not only to electronic music fans, but to fans of creative music. Matmos' ideas and asthetic should be commended and set an example for electronic artists everywhere."
3,...,"If you like groups like matmos, autechre, aphex twin, boards of canada, squarepusher or any other type of abstract electronic music, you will enjoy Parka. Songs are rare, but they have become my favorite group. The members from Parka are currently searching for a label to produce their first album. Check for downloads anywhere you can to hear something mind-blowing and unique."
3,Entertaining,"On initial listens, I enjoyed this album's playfulness, inventive uses of sounds,and progression from funky to intense over the course of the album. Some of the basslines are quite nice as well.That said, I think this album is well made, but lacks an inherent complexity and depth that would inspire me to keep it in my collection for a sustained period of time.So to sum up this review, I found this album mentally entertaining, but not moving."
3,Interesting over engaging,"Some very creatively-creepy electronic work here comes closer to presenting a tongue-slightly-in-cheek audio surgical tour than anyone had ever cared to venture. The results are noticeably effective, often compelling texturally, though usually do not rise past what the inherent gimmickry suggests, making for morbidly splendid background."
5,hi the bees are awesome,"you heard me! they are fun and pop and rock. they are a bit similar to the beta band, the beatles, os mutantes, fun bands like those. their first cd is really good too (""sunshine hit me"") although it's kind of mellower. i hardly ever write reviews because i am really bad at it. sorry. but try some bees! do it."
3,No Staying Power,"Simply put: Average listening, no staying power. Songs lack the staying power one expects from the best. There are no incredible songs to be had, these guys are okey (okey-do-ke) and in my opinion rating this band 5 Stars might lead to some unwanted purchase from a friendly consumer (like me). 3 stars for Band of Bees ""Free the Bees""."
3,A History of British Rock,"My initial reaction to The Bees was that this sextet blacked out on rank 60's psychedelica and woke up with a post-punk hangover. Further exposure to their second release, Free the Bees, righted what came to seem a grave misconception. Multi-instrumentalists Paul Butler and Aaron Fletcher expand their band to a talented sextet that reigns over the history of British rock at will, from the late 60's homage ""These Are the Ghosts"" through the music hall blues stomp of ""No Atmosphere"" though the waltzing ""The Start"". What really hooks you in, though, is ""Chicken Payback"": a rollicking track you'd swear had a 50's copyright until you check the fine print. It sounds like the kind of authentic dance cut you'd swear you've heard on a John Waters' soundtrack. And from that point on, it's only rock and roll, and you'll like it."
5,The Bees-They're buzzin'.,"You will not listen to a better album this year. The Bees have touched the quick by improving on their last album ""Sunshine Hit Me."" It's more professional (which I believe is a good thing) and their song writing talents are overwhelming (check out track 9 ""Hour Glass""). I predict this band will be bigger that Oasis was in the 1990's; at least they deserve to be. This is one of those rare albums your mum actually tells you to turn up! It fuses classic 60's rifts with a modern and up beat vibe making it flawless. The Bees, we salute you!"
5,Bees wax: a treat for pop music historians *,"Anyone who loves the Beatles, 60's garage rock, classic soul and R&B, and 60's-early 70's pyschedelic rock and pop, needs this fantastic cd. Chock full of well crafted melodic, catchy, British pop songs, The Bees deliver the goods, great vocals and plenty of soul, chops and more. Worth it, if just for the hilarious nugget, ""Chicken Payback"". The soul ballad ""I Love You"" is another highlight. Every song works. Finally, a modern band I can sink my teeth into. Perfect for anyone who digs The Beatles, The Kinks, Love & Arthur Lee, Pink Floyd's 1st album, and Rhino's ""Nuggets"" box set."
3,Good but not great,"First, let me tell you: I've consumed encyclopedias (book and e-form)for a long time now, I am also a teacher and for me this is an OK product but not great. It is not user friendly, the text looks poor on the screen (I have top of the line Viewsonic monitor), the maps are bad (no zoom, no roads, no details--only political). The layout is not very efficient, windows tile and you constantly have to move them around.The strongest point I can make for this product is its in-depth articles but that's it. It does not encourage exploring like Encarta. In short, I'd say that this product is more for college students than smaller kids. If you have kids through HS, then I'd recommend you get Encarta."
1,This is garbage,"I had trouble with this from the moment I installed it on my computer. When I did a system restore I had further trouble. When I did it again it didn't even work, it froze on me. I cannot get in touch with the support team. You have to pay for the call to them and usually you cannot get through to them. They do not return you calls. I would never buy another product from them again."
2,Not what I expected,"My base is lit but very low, not bright at all. Another problem for me is that the yellow is brighter than the blue. I was expecting a bright blue lamp with little yellow and green.This is my second Tiffany lamp and I love my first one. This lamp makes me wary to buy another online."
5,"Basic,Yet Powerful - Looks Nice On My Counter","I recently got into a green smoothie regime, so I needed a blender, pronto. I could not afford anything over 50 bucks, so I settled for this one based on the limited reviews. I have to say, this blender not only looks nice on my counter, but it works well. It blends frozen broccoli and frozen fruits, including frozen crushed pineapples, very well. I notice I need to allow it to work for at least a minute, but it's all worth it.I've only had it for about 3 weeks, but it works exceptionally well, and I use 2 - 3 times a day."
2,Good While It Lasted,"This blender blends ingrediants to a smooth consistency and its appearance is nice. However, the blender only lasted about 4 months during which I used it about 15 times, mostly for blender drinks. The blender quit after I had it on for about 2-3 minutes blending hummus. I turned the blender off after the three minutes to add a couple ingredients and when I tried to turn it back on it tripped the outlet it was plugged into. I reset the outlet and tried to flip the blender on again. Dead ever since. I think the blender does no have any type of over heating protection built in. This is just a guess and I would not recommend this company to others based on my experience with this blender. It is constructed well, but when corners could be cut I think they were and now I have a junk blender. It is still under warranty, but will cost 15$ to ship it to them. The blender only cost 40 to begin with, so I probably won't bother."
3,"Nice design, so so quality control.","The stainless ""ring"" at the base of the jar (which is glued on) came off right when I opened the package. It might have been a good blender otherwise, but I never gave it a chance, do to the issue mentioned above. I've sent it back."
5,"Best flex head 3/8 on the market, bar none!","Like the title of my review says, this ratchet is bar none the best 3/8 flex head ratchet on the market (that includes the high end truck brands). The mechanism is smooth but positive, the flex head is built MUCH stronger than the competition and the ratchet itself is simply beautiful to look at. I'm not an SK loyalist by any means, as I own a number of other ratchets (Proto, Craftsman, etc.) but for 3/8"" drive, I think this is going to be my new go to ratchet when a flex head is needed. You can see and feel the quality in this ratchet when you use it and it is absolutely worth the moderate price it typically lists at. This puppy has been around for decades and there's a solid reason for that -it's simply a great design that can't be beat. Pick one up for yourself and you won't be disappointed."
3,Chair for son's reading area,I bought this chair for my son's reading area in his room. (My son is 6 years old.) He periodically sits in it but doesn't seem to enjoy it as much as his brother does (2 years of age). My youngest likes to jump on it like it's a bean bag and delights in sitting in it and pretending to read. It is a very durable product and I forsee ours getting lots of use.
2,Lousy published edition of a great book,"The Worst Journey in the World is one of the best written travel adventure books of all time. This particular edition is not worthy of this great literary work. The type is barely legible and the book looks like someone's research paper. I would not buy this particular edition of the book and in fact i returned it for a refund and got instead the Basic Books, paperback version published in 2008 which was available for about the same price."
4,Stunning Antarctic Adventure,"Stunning from start to finish, this true-life adventure is told in the words of the explorers, scientists, and seaman who pushed the Scott Expedition to the South Pole from 1910-1913. It is beautiful in its descriptions of the seas, the storms. and the creatures they encountered. The language is rivoting as the story of human capacity and tragedy unfold."
2,Terrible edition of a classic adventure saga,"This edition of Cherry-Garrard's classic was extremely disappointing. I received it as a gift and did not begin reading it immediately. If I had, I would have returned it immediately. It is an outwardly attractive paperback that seems sturdy and well bound, but, there is incomplete publishing information, illustrations are lacking, no forward or afterward, etc. The cover should have told the tale; the author's name is misspelled! I assume the complete text of the original is contained within the covers, but nothing else. This is a cheap knock-off of a classic text and the publisher should be ashamed of producing such an inferior product. This edition was published 25 February, 2012 according to my copy, but Amazon says December 23, 2011. I received this copy for Christmas, 2011, so the information on the last printed page of the book must be incorrect. Buyer beware, you can do much better by buying another edition of this incredible book."
2,"Looks like it was ""published"" at Kinko's","(This review rates this published edition of the book, not the value of the text inside). This book looks like it was published at a Kinkos. ""Typewriter"" font, references that are typed out like a 1970s thesis, and allusions to illustrations that don't exist are the main problems.This narrative by Apsley Cherry-Garrand deserves better."
1,Buyer beware,"A total waste of money. This is a hand typed rip-off of the original book on large pages and no illustrations. Buy the book, not this format."
4,"Long, But Very Well Written",Simply put this is a great book. The summation chapter at the end of the book was my favorite when the author admits that if all we ever want to be is a nation of shopkeepers than polar exploration seems absurd. Four stars given only because I liked Landsing's Endurance so much.
3,The Better Read,"While Cherry-Gerrard book does give an excellent first hand account of Scott's ill-fated attempt to reach the South Pole in 1911/12, a better read for the scientific evaluation of the event can be found in Susan Soloman's chronical, THE COLDEST MARCH. Here, actual scientific facts are brought together with accounts from the writings of Cherry-Gerrard, Wilson, Scott, as well as others from the Terra Nova expedition. While both are excellent reads, I prefer THE COLDEST MARCH given the overlay of modern scientific data to support what may have gone wrong on the Scott expedition."
2,overrated and lengthy tale-for hardcore pole readers only,"In this instance..quantity does not equal quality. The book is ponderous, repetitive, poorly edited and not even very descriptive. With so many Antarctic exploration reading choices available...there are much better books available..unless you're into reading day-by-day expedition logs. For Scott fans..read A First Rate Tragedy or even Scott's Last Voyage-(with those superb Ponting photos). For Shackleton fans..Endurance or South. Cherry-Garrard should have used an editor as Sir Ernest did to scope the story down. Your story doesn't have to be long to be dramatic or effective. Lastly...to see how an Antarctic tale should be done..read Douglas Mawson's hugely underrated The Home Of The Blizzard. The Worst Journey In The World should be read..just after you've finished better crafted pieces first and when you have the time to plow through its' almost 600 pages."
3,The unknown face,I liked very much reading this book. However I am disappointed that not a single picture of Cherry-Garrard is enclosed. So the reader still doesn`t know the face behind the story.
5,WHAT YOU HOPE YOUR HUSBAND COULD DO,"Get this book and read it to your children. Teach them of the days when men were men (and British at that!). Wean them from the cultural myth that whining and wimping and looking out for yourself alone are desirable traits. This book is about more than survival; it is about life and living. Here men give their all for the mission, for each other, for the animals in their service. You read it and wonder, could I have lived it? The book will answer, reminding you that there is more to life and more to live for, than we ever realized."
2,Interesting topic but unfocused book,"Am I the only one who didn't love this book? After reading about Shackleton's adventures in the book ""Endurance"", I longed to read more about antarctic exploration. However, ""The Worst Journey in the World"" fell far short of my expectations. The first half was too long and not written well enough to sustain my interest. The author kept going off on tangents that made it hard for me to focus on this book. The story picks up in the second half, but I was sorely disappointed. Check out ""Endurance"" for a better read."
2,Can you review a book that you did not entirely read?,"I read about 50 pages and had to quit. Time was, I would never do that. I'm older now, and if the writing is way too verbose and stuck in irrelevant details that do not lend anything to the story, I quit. I really like adventure books and was surprised that this one wouldn't grab me. I don't think it is the story (from other reviews, the story is a good one); seems that the author and I just don't mix.Maybe I will pick it up again at some time and give it another shot. Looking at the size of this book, it is unlikely. If I do, I will give it a fair review.To put this review in context, I happened to have LOVED the story of Endurance by Alfred Lansing. Go figure."
2,A highly over-rated book.,"This is at best a third-rate account of Scott's incompetent expedition. It is basically a compilation of snippets from three different diaries. The author has absolutely no perspective on the gross inadequacies in technology and leadership that needlessly cost several lives, and imperiled many more. This account is also unbelievable long and repetitive, making weeks seem like months, months like years, and years like decades.An infinitely superior treatment is Roland Huntford's ""The Last Place on Earth"" (originally published as ""Amundson and Scott"")."
5,The ultimate tale of comradeship,"It's unacceptable how could we quit being real men in less than a century, and this splendid book is the synthesis of this idea. In times when the biggest adventure is to find room for your car in a shopping center parking lot, Mr. Cherry-Garrard shows how strength, courage, boldness, fortitude, and most of all, comeradeship, can overcome the harshest conditions found in our planet. And, in the end, we get the opportunity to find out what is the greatest lesson brought by the adventure: the essence of the adventure of living is to practice the fraternal love. In the winter jorney, Mr. Garrard had his Revelation, and set the standards for the new men that we all should be - and we're sorry we heaven't learnt in yet."
1,not so expensive chair cushions,"Very disappointed. It's true, the colors appear to be different on the e-mail. They looked yellow and are very orange. Done very cheaply, the ties rip of the cushions after one time sitting on them. The foam is very thin and does not recover at all after sitting on it. The pillow I am sitting on every day started out to be 2.5 cm thick. Now it is now just 1 cm thick and my bottom aches. Actually I will send them back, just decided that now."
3,OK for the price,"Nice color and good price for four cushions, but they are very thin and not that comfortable to sit on, but they will do in a pinch."
4,Very good for identifying causes for behavior,"I found this book very useful in identifying how my own behavior patterns were developed from a young age. The book contains detailed descriptions of family dynamics that can lead to dysfunctional behavior as an adult. The book is less strong on identifying ways to break those cycles of behavior, but for anyone getting started on personal growth and learning new ways of interacting with people this book is a very good starting point."
5,One of Jack London's Most Racially Conscious Works,"This is a very exciting novel where the Nordics, Aryans, whatever you want to call them are the heroes, the officers of THE ELSINORE who are faced with mutiny by a crew made up of other races. It's inspiring to read a pro-WASP book that's well written. London was a great man of action and intellect who said these words at a Socialist Party conference: ""I am a White Man first, and only then a Socialist."" Words to inspire and ponder. I wonder what London would be saying today if he were here. I bet he'd know the score."
5,Atlanta Braves Talking Bottle Opener,It is a great conversation piece! Has vintage play by play voice clips.
5,Excellent Book,"The author (a well known pastor and speaker) shares his experience of being diagnosed and treated for cancer. He doesn't sugarcoat the struggle to deal with life's ""bends in the road"", but looks to the teachings of the Bible to help us cope with these issues. Very readable and helpful."
1,disappointing,"If you are reading this book in hopes of finding a personal story, you will be disappointed. This book is a trip through the Psalms, with reflections on what the psalmists may have intended. Only a fraction of its pages can be considered, in any way, a personal reflection on the bend in the road -- that's left to King David."
1,CANNOT PLAY,"This is essentially the same review that I left for American Conquest Anthology. I installed this game with no problems, but it will not run on my computer. I have a brand new laptop (Intel Core2Duo 2.2GZ processor, Nvidia Geforce 8600GT video card, 120GB hard drive, Windows XP Media Center). I am playing Doom 3 with no problems, so it must be a problem with this game (and American Conquest Anthology). Is it a concidence that they are both packaged by the same company, in a generic red and clear package? I don't know, but I DO know that neither of these games will run on my new laptop. It closes with an .exe error message. Totally ridiculous. I will stay away from no-name companies and non-mainstream games from now on.Overall = TERRIBLE"
4,Cite it Right,This is a good book for me. I tutor university students who sometimes have trouble with citations bordering on plagarism.This source is clear and informative.
5,1985 - Enuff Z'Nuff,"Yet another fine release from a criminally underrated band. Think Cheap Trick, The Beatles, Van Halen, and Queen in a car crash, and everybody comes out okay!"
3,Former model?,"I think this is an old former model of the Stanley Wonder Bar -if its a ""Wonder Bar"". As far as I know, the tip should be yellow,and the sizes of the most recent models are 12-3/8"" and 21""."
1,Low quality tool using original product code,"Stanley 55-515 12-inch Wonderbar Pry BarI own the original bar sold years ago under the same model number. The two tools share the same length and general shape. The original has a forged taper on the ends which makes it thin enough yet strong enough to get behind trim and pry. The new bar has a crude beveled edge ground into the bar ends. It is too thick to be useful as a trim tool. The notches are too small be useful for nail removal. The original is nickel or chrome plated and is stamped ""made in the U.S.A."" The new bar is painted and lacks a country of origin label."
4,"useful, yes, indestructible, no","The original Wonderbar is a a useful tool for for a lot of things but its not really great at anything. It would be a good choice for someone who is just getting started and doesn't have any other pry bars or someone that needs to travel light. It does help to sharpen both ends with a grinder. Definitely not indestructible as I have broken one of these, and I am not a big guy. Broke at bend while prying a couple of 2x apart.For small delicate jobs like removing trim I like the Red Devil Scrape-n-Pry and for serious work I use a 36"" wrecking bar. Why strain yourself when you can just use a longer lever? For pulling nails the Shark Grip nail pullers cannot be beat. The Wonder Bar can do all of these things, it just doesn't do any of them as well as the specialized tools do."
4,smaller than I thought,"Probably my fault for not reading the specs, but it's smaller than I thought. It's just a hand-sized pry bar, though it's well built and will do the job."
5,Large pry bar does the job,"Large pry bar about 1.5 ft long or so that does the job, it is good at whatever you want to pry up but not real precise or clean on woodwork or trim pieces on wall or windows. Otherwise it works just great and would recommend to others."
4,Does the job flawlessly & portable,"This object is solid, forged steel and does the job well. I call it the wrecking bar, but it is also easy to control with the size and leverage available."
5,Solid Tool,"The Stanley 55-515 12-inch Wonderbar Pry Bar lives up to the high standards of standard Stanley products.The tool feels great in your hand and gets the job done perfectly.After owning the tool for a few months, I have zero complaints.Highly Recommended."
5,I love Rookie Readers!,Rookie Readers are great at allowing ESOL students to develop reading skills along with Social Studies and Scientific concepts. I can't get enough of them and use them with all age groups.
5,Seven Clans of the Cherokee Society,"This book is short, concise, easy to read and a great thumbnail sketch of the clans and their functions.I highly recommend it, as the information is the best I have found. It is suitable for any age and clearly written and an excellent tool to get up-to-date information on ancient wisdom(s)...Thank you, thank you Marcelina Reed!William Taylor's drawings were surreal in a multi-dimensional way - took me there!"
3,A quick simple introduction,"There are many good writings within this book. A short introduction into Cherokee ways. In some ways too short, but it does help to understand the clan system and how it came about."
5,Great start to learning about the Cherokee Tribe,"They don't teach this stuff in history in school. Its a good start to learning about the Cherokee People and their culture. The book is easily understood and simple, but informative. It is quite interesting to see how true Christianity and the Cherokee had very similar morals as well as an understanding of the number ""7"" as God sees it."
5,The Greatest Band Ever,"Jibe is one of the greatest bands ever, its sad that they broke up, they were probably the best band to see live. In My head is a great cd, also check out Uprising great cd best songs are broken, yesterdays gone, uprising, hypocrite. I am going to miss Jibe and there incredable shows. If you ever see one of there cds make sure you buy it, its well worth the money."
1,shitty album!,VERY BAD ALBUM! I had the unpleasant experience of buying and hearing this album. I got rid of it within the next month. I don't hate Tiamet - this album just blew. Buy CLOUDS or WILDHONEY.
5,One of the most intoxicating albums ever,"This is one of Tiamats best albums and their most diverse. I hear a lot of comparisions to Pink Floyd. While I agree, I think this release is more inspired by Tiamat themselves. Melodic solo's fly with swirling keyboards. Hard-edged guitar's and deep warm vocals. As far as originality goes, no band has anything on Tiamat. I think this album, along with Judas Christ and Skeleton Skeletron are the best, but this album has a spark all its own. If you like bands like Type O Negative or The Cure but can delve into foreign territories(sitars, oboe's)then this album is for you. This is NOT commercial music. If you have heard of them consider yourself lucky. Fantastic album. Get it."
5,Excellent work,"Paradiso (Hardcover)~ Robert Hollander (Author), Jean Hollander The Hollander translation and commentary are quite scholarly and absorbing. To think I got the hardcover for the cost of a paperback is a plus!"
5,"Amazing Product, Amazing Value!","Gates has always been the premiere manufacturer of timing belts, and I was prepared to pay around $30 each for these. What a nice surprise when I found them at Amazon.com for less than half! A wonderful product at an amazing price!"
5,Beautiful album,"This has always been one of my favorite black metal (can you call it that?) albums. Granted, it's not perfect, but I gave it 5 stars since it's been a constant presence in my CD player for about 9 years. The only negative comment I can make is that it might be a little repetitive, but that doesn't bother me too much. The vocals (provided by Legion, former Marduk vocalist) are great and harsh, and stand in stark contrast to the music, which could not in the least be described as black metal. The riffs are more in the vein of melodic Black Sabbath, mostly consisting of single string, often blues-based melodies. The riffs seem to meander all over the place, but always maintain the same motif. It's rather simple, but quite unique and beautiful."
1,pure dissapointment,"I bought this cd few months after its release. I knew three things about it.First: members from abruptum/marduk (though i didn't like these bands much, i took that as a ""quality insurance"" because i respect their work)Second:slow atmospheric doom/black metal, and Third: i read somewhere ""in the style of Katatonia"" (they hadn't released brave murder day yet).This one was the description i waited for!I bought the cd without second thought.That was it...i made many attempts to listen to the whole cd but in vain...it was just unbearable. Indeed slow doom/black metal, but the most atonal and uninteresting riffs, mediocre vocals and as for the atmosphere i ""found"" it only in the poetic titles and the well-looked-after artwork and cd cover. A true dissapointment."
5,Thin Line Between Love and Obsession...,"Victor, born in the midst of public transportation, has recently met a young woman for a one night stand in a public bathroom and now has strong feelings for her. He enters the woman's apartment when she thinks it is her drug dealer and it turns into an unpleasant incident where two police officers are involved. One of the policemen gets shot during a struggle over a gun and he later marries the woman that Victor is in love with. Victor is put in jail where his hatred cultivates and he passes the time by studying the bible. Years later, when Victor is released he runs into the woman again. Live Flesh is a strong film with a message of love and affection concerning individual choice."
4,"It is so Almodovar, just great","Once again you get surprised by Pedro Almodovar, he has a very special way of seing everything. You can always expect everything from him. He is really good in this film. Maybe its not his best, but it is very interesting, original and amusing. I really advice you to see it"
5,"Born badly, die badly?","This movie has one of the most astounding openings, grabs your attention and keeps it from when the main character is born. I have been watching more foreign films for something a little different. This is from Madrid, Spain with nice yellow subtitles. I didn't have any trouble following the story, even if you don't read every word. It also has some beautiful Spanish music. After being sent to prison because of a woman, Victor decides to become the greatest lover in the world. There are many plot twists which I would not want to spoil for you. The actors and actresses are great, makes it all believable. It is such a twisted tale of 2 policement and 1 Victor. It also deals with abuse. I enjoyed this movie the first time I watched it and many times afterwards. ""We are two teardrops in a song!"""
3,Catholic High School Examinations,"Although this book is very educational in some areas, it lacks difficulty in others. This book has helped my cousins, sisters, and mom. Overall, I'd say that thi sbook is well-written and has helped many people."
4,huh?,"that was my reaction when i read the words to the songs on this cd. a lot of the words and meanings are extremely obscure (""five little children defining the outcasts""? if someone can explain that, please do.) Although their love for the Lord does come out in a few songs such as mycro, they were better at expressing it on their earlier stuff. when you get past the lyrics, though, the music is the best ever. comes crashing is very good, as is mycro and the good times. i enjoy this cd a lot, even though i do wonder about some of the lyrics."
5,Buy this CD NOW!,"What can I say? This CD cranks. From beginning to end all the songs are good. Especially ""Building a Better Me"", ""Comes Crashing"", and ""Nothing New"". ""More Than Conquerors"" was good, but ""Building a Better Me"" is better. If you buy this CD, you will not be disappointed. If you listen to this CD and are disappointed you don't know good music when you hear it. BUY IT!!!"
2,Careful with play gym attachment!,"The play gym cross bar ""baby Einstein"" attachment on this product collapsed on my 3 month old! I had used it before with no problems and thought I was careful in putting it up but the clips keeping it on must have come undone and it collapsed on her. She was not hurt, but could have been if the heaviest part had falled on her. I actually like the regular pack and play part of this very much -- easy to put up, relatively light, nice primary colors -- and will continue to use that but I will not use the ""baby Einsten"" attachment anymore."
4,Great playard - LOVE bassinet,"This is a great pack'n'play. It's easy to set-up and take any place. The bassinet is great - very sturdy and larger than another one that I have. The colors are bright and the music piece keeps our baby's attention. My only problem is the piece for the top. Whenever I try to use it, the arms bow in and it doesn't look very sturdy. I also have trouble using this piece and the mat on the ground. It just doesn't seem very sturdy and I have tried everything.Other than that, I am glad that I bought this!!"
4,good but nothing special,"Pretty much the same as the other Graco playpens, really. The upside is that theoretically, you get a play-gym within this system by attaching the arch on the bassinet pad and using it on your floor. The downside is that there's no changing station included with this one - and having an elevated changing pad is a bigger deal than I had anticipated, as it gets hard on your back to lean down into the bassinett for frequent diaper changing during the daytime."
5,LOVE this!,"I put this together when I was still pregnant by myself. It was very easy to do. It is easy to put down and put back up. I love the detachable toys. It keeps our little guy busy.The reviews about babies not being able to stay in it long, DUH you are not supposed to keep babies in these for long periods of time...they like to be held! LOL"
2,It's a waste of money for me,"We bought this playpen for our then 4-5 months old son, but didn't find it of much use, for he hated to be put inside the playpen. Everytime we put him in, he would just cry, so it ended being our toy storage box.The music it plays is kind of short & quiet, has never caught any of his attention. For $119, I wish we hadn't wasted our money on that."
2,"Polished, sexist Elvis trash","Hilariously unenlightened product is a glossy time capsule concerning free love, upper class, conservative style. I enjoyed the locations and the late 1960's fashions. It's a tad more sexually explicit than Elvis' previous romps, this was supposed to pass as sophisticated break from his G-rated adventures."
3,No Cookie Cutter Offering,"It's possible that Director Norman Taurog finally realized that it was Elvis in '68, not Crosby in '38, and gave him a chance to mature his on-screen personae: here Elvis gets entangled with a bohemian babe and handles simultaneous photography assignments, one in the ""adult"" category. There are four very good songs. (Aside to Presley historians: was ""Let's Forget About The Stars"" possibly the original selection for the production number which became ""A Little Less Conversation""?)"
2,goofy girl,"Didn't care at all for the premise of the movie, the girl chasing the guy - and she was so cheesy. And the fact that he ended up liking her after all the ridiculous trickery was not believable to me.The sequences when Elvis had two job I did enjoy but overall this is an Elvis movie I did not care for. Elvis also seemed to have a scowl on his face through many parts of the movie."
5,This gift has been watched a LOT :-)!,My husband is a big Elvis movie fan so this was a gift for him. He loved it and has watched it several times. It is in his don't sale or give-away group LOL.
1,useless,as a field bio I have to say that this book is just a waste of any investment of intellectual capital. It consists of page after page of un-labeled graphs and a series of references to other studies that are readily available. The price is outlandish considering this is nothing more than a glorified undergraduate term paper.
5,"Get the ""Collection"" set..not this one DVD","These are really outstanding movies about the Wars between England and France in the late 1700's and early 1800's and I highly recommend the complete set...Includes eight feature-length Hornblower films: The Duel, The Fire Ships, The Duchess and the Devil, The Wrong War, The Mutiny, Retribution, Loyalty, Duty.........however this DVD is only 2 of the 8.... so beware.......otherwise the costumes are very well done as are the individual stories themselves. Excellent overall..."
5,They just do not make movies like this anymore!,I searched amazon over and over looking for more. I never wanted it to end. Brilliant acting scenes that were amazing. Loved it.
2,Big and cushy but smells bad,"It's big and cushy, but it's stinks badly like a can of turpentine. Even after airing it out for two weeks in the back yard, and then sitting on our floor for months it sill is a bit unpleasant smelling when laying on it."
4,Contemporary Gospel at Its Best,"I listened to the entire CD at an exclusive store in Atlanta's Buckhead mall. Besides having a catchy title, the tracks were arranged beautifully. The first track, Have Your Way by Beyonce/Kelly and the fifth track. Don't Worry by One Nation Crew/Kirk Franklin were the best ones to me, but there were stellar performaces by Dawkins & Dawkins, Hezekia Walker and Stephanie Mills as well. This CD is an absolute must for your gospel collection. You won't be dissapointed. I will even give you your money back :<)...."
2,This works great when you understand the mechanics but it broke easily.,"My husband bought me two of these, the first I broke after three weeks of use the second after two nights. The mechanics are great for arousal but they are not strong enough to withstand muscle pressure without breaking. I loved the feel but the price was too high for the use."
2,Not big enough,"The girth is very disappointing, how about something for us moms out there.Clit stimulus is a little too strong, but adds a great feel.Batteries are a bit hard to get in, not going to do this in the darkor quick.Rotating beads are a great feature."
1,not impressed,"I wasn't very impressed with this. I wish I could return it. For me, its too long and when my husband and I used it together it hurt! The hummingbird part is too flimsy, doesn't stay in place and the control section is heavy and bulky...personally I was looking for something that wouldn't require so much work! I didn't notice much of a change either from the low settings to the high settings. I have showed it to a few girlfriends who were curious and looking to buy (hey don't judge....we're army wives and sex deprived for a year! we share tips!) and they didn't like the look of it or the weight. Wouldn't not recommend."
4,Love this vibe!,"This vibe is awesome. I've never NOT reached the big ""O"" using this toy. It is quiet, vibrates as strong or soft as you want. I'm not a fan of the beads, though. They hurt a bit, so I only use the vibration. However, that's more than enough. I've even squirted with this, which is way awesome. My biggest complaint, though, is the battery pack slides off and the batteries fall out at the most inopportune times. Haha. But yea, I wish they would design a better battery pack, other than the slide to open and close design. Other than that, this toy is great! I highly recommend."
2,It hurt,"This is my first vibrator and maybe I didn't use it properly - but it hurt! I think that it was too big for me...Also the ""hummingbird"" attachment was too sharp and uncomfortable for my own personal preferences. It left me feeling numb down there and a little sore. Maybe this just isn't my thing. I wouldn't recommend this as a first toy."
1,Could have gotten this information online for free!!!,"This book isn't worth the money. I bought it for my daughter who told me it was worthless. I was upset at her attitude but then read it myself. Sadly she was correct, if a bit ungrateful."
2,Overload,"My wife bought me this as a gift because I expressed learning more about the ""Book of the Dead.""This book was very detailed. I wonder if its used as a Textbook! More detail than I cared to know about.The wording explaining concepts was overy used. I got to the point that I just started the first letter of the word insted of trying to pronounce the word! If you are a serious religious student this is a book for you. I just wanted a flavor of Tibetan Religous teaching, I sorry to say I wasn't smart enough to finish."
5,Pretty darn good mallet,"I've used this thing for several months now, and some of that that use has been for four hours non stop. It works quite well. There are other cheaper mallets out there that may get the job done just fine, but I prefer this one. It has the right combination of weight and hitting power. It's also harder than a lot of the cheap ones, so it doesn't tear up as quickly."
2,Really not worth it,"This is the 80s movie ""The Creature Wasn't Nice"" re-titled to cash in on the success of Nielsen's ""Naked Gun"" movies. It has some good ideas, but it completely lacks any sense of timing. It all comes across as slow and unrehearsed. The big highlight of the movie, when the creature sings ""I want to eat your face"", could have become a camp favorite if they'd have picked up the tempo and cut out at least 2 minutes of the song. Even the guy in the creature costume acts like he's wondering when the song will end--he completely runs out of schtick before it does. Most people wouldn't expect much from a [inexpensive] DVD, and this movie proves them right. You could come up with a hundred better ways to waste an hour-and-a-half, I'm sure."
2,BAAAAAAAD!,"OH MY LORD. I just finished watching this and I can't believe I sat through the whole thing. There was absolutely nothing funny about this movie. Watching Leslie Neilson punch & slap every button on the space ship console while it makes beeping noises,to avoid a meteor shower. HILARIOUS!! Watching a guy slip around with a mop on a soapy floor for five minutes..HA! What a hoot! That's about the best of it I'm afraid, unless you count the red alien that sings"" I want to eat your face"". Had I not already heard about that part from other reviews before hand, I probably would have found that funny, but the punchline was wasted on me. Most of what fills this movie is simply a badly written script, Actors trying really hard to be funny,and it just doesn't work. This is the kind of stuff you expect to hear a laugh track at any moment, to cue you when to chuckle. I had hoped for more from this space comedy, but probably will never watch it again."
1,This movie is horrible!,"I can honestly say that this is the worst movie in my collection. I have the DVD and consider the time I spent watching it as a complete waste. Its a good thing that there are no special features on the DVD, because I would have wasted more time watching that. Please skip this one."
3,every night naked space,"originaly i saw this with my best friend and his dad when i was perhaps 11 ish.... now, i am 21 and i rediscovered the cheap campyness of this film, i watch it every night, basically whenever i wake up i push it in the vcr and it plays. i've seen it more times than anyone has seen starwars. its one of those movies that you watch over and over and over and are in an eternal rut throughout, till the tape breaks, which it is close to.seeing that the bountiful cheapness of the movie is directed toward perhaps younger people, then again, there is a lot of swearing and risky(ish) stuff, it is no surprise to me that this type of movie is no longer made. it has no target audience. and it will be one of the classics the way ed wood's and roger corman's movies are classic campys now. i would buy ten of these if i was you."
2,Not the worst movie ever made...,".. but definitely a waste of time and money. The script is unrelentingly unfunny. I may have smiled once. I primarily bought this movie to watch Leslie Nielsen. Unfortunately, he played it ""straight"" with none of his patented wordplay and facial humor. My advice: don't buy this movie. Rather, re-watch the Naked Gun series or Police Squad instead."
1,Oh My Good!,"I can truly say that I haven't seen worse movie than this one. The ""fun"" parts of the film would just make you want to cry... Leslie Nielsen is a top acter, but this movie makes him look really bad. Fortunately he has many films that are extremely funny."
2,You know a movie is bad....,"....when it has more than one title. This was originally released as ""The Creature Wasn't Nice"". I don't think the title change helps at all.This is basically an ""Alien"" spoof, where a creature roams the spaceship tormenting Leslie Nielson, Cindy Williams, et al, and of course hilarity is supposed to ensue. It doesn't. The whole mess is just one corny sight gag after another. This might fare well in the 8-13 age group, but adults will be embarrassed by the silliness.This is the same directing/writing team that put together ""The First Nudie Musical"", which was only slightly more amusing."
4,A Very Well Made Spoof For Such A Modest Budget,"I stumbled across this movie when I was in college. My friend and I were wandering through the student center when we noticed Leslie Nielsen on the t.v. so we sat down and watched. We both loved it so much that we decided we had to find it and rent it again. Originally titled ""Spaceship"" but changed I assume to capitalize on ""Naked Gun"" fame; ""Naked Space"" is a hilarious spoof of most any alien movie. Written and directed by a virtual unknown (Bruce Kimmel) and starring Leslie Nielsen, ""Naked Space"" is a very funny slapstick B-movie. Instead of parodying multiple movies like most of the slapstick movies of today, the entire movie is one long parody. The jokes were very clever and the performances were very earnest, which made the jokes even funnier. The cast did very well with what was obviously a very small budget and ridiculous script. I laughed a lot. For those who like well made spoofs, I highly recommend this movie"
3,"Average movie, but you gotta love that song!","Not the most original or creative of the Flying High style movie rip offs, but it has its moments. When the crew accidently bring a slimy monster on board, its not long before things get messy. I haven't seen this movie for at least 8 years, but I will never forget the monster prancing around singing""I want to eat your face..."" in a very elegant operatic baritone. Well worth it for that scene alone."
3,Very technical for one who is just looking for guidelines,This book is extremely technical in discussing home brewing. Simpler language and experiential anecdotes would work better for us.
5,Miracles of the Heart is a captivating story of restoration,"It is full of human emotion, compassion of God showing through people, and healing. This book would make a wonderful movie. Even my tough husband was touched by the story. It held his interest to the point that he could not put it down until he finished it. The story is believable and authentic in terms of the medical aspects. It pulls the reader in to be totally able to identify with the characters."
5,Realistic,"This book has portrayed reality in the relationships between men, women, and Christ. I found my spirit renewed with peace and awe in view of the miracles God performs. All we need to do is pay attention!"
5,Miracles of the Heart,It was wonderful! The story hooked me in and wouldn't let go until I had finished it. This book is so filled with the love of God that it will make your heart pound and your eyes fill with tears. It is a powerful message that God loves us no matter what we have done.
4,Nordic jazz at its best,This CD contains scandinavian jazz on a high level. The rythmesection is very inventive and the sax sounds great. Very highly recommended.
3,BUY ELEGEION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ( and this),"this album is the first album i got by T.O.T. (i wanted to get the album T.O.T. by T.O.T. first but i could'nt) and it has made a pretty good impression however i had the missfortune to hear the greatest album of this genre first and now anything else i hear is bound to sound inferior.( the album is called ODYSSEY INTO DARKNESS by ELEGEION. BUY IT you will not be dissapointed i swear it and i hope you will agree with me) but having said that this is still a very good album with some fantastic moments that have been emphasised by the length of the songs just building up the anticipation more and more. but it needs some better guitaring and the violining( if thats a real word) should have an actual tune rather than just goiong in for the hell of it. but it is still a good album and will not dissapoint you in the least, and will probably impress you a lot."
2,"Come on, guys. Wake up!","This music is cheesy. Do you think this is good goth or doom metal? What is this? The weak female voice is nothing. The growling male vocal is just so so. There is nothing serious in composition or playing. No good guitar riffs. The keyboard sounds like cheap (but deceiving) elevator music. The drumming is boring.This is one of the most horriblly commercial goth.(If it could be called goth).If you are looking for good moody sound, try My dying bride and Type O negative. At least they know how to compose. This cd is just boring."
2,Um...is this a joke?,"What a great idea! Take a beautifully melodic female vocalist, lugubrious and moody music, and throw in a ridiculous sounding death metal vocalist to ruin the entire thing!Velvet Darkness They Fear has to have been one of the most confusing, downright weird musical journeys of my life. At first, I was rather impressed. You start with some cool, dark, quiet textures with some element of beauty. You also have a lovely female vocalist with a delightful voice. So why the stupid sounding death metal vox? Maybe it's ""cool"" or whatever, but to me it just sounded stupid. Why? Why? Why? It's dumb and ridiculous. If they wanted to preserve the gothic mood, it IS possible to find a vocalist with talent beyond growling that still sounds ""dark"" and ""gothic.""Be warned. This music is strange and confusing."
4,Represent Yourself in Court,Another good reference book when having to deal with the judicial system. It hits right on the money when it talks about the court system and being treated wrongly because you choose to represent yourself versus paying a high priced lawyer. This is serious business and you must be ready to run with the big dogs or stay on the porch. They will eat you up if you show signs of weakness and haven't made a serious effort to defend yourself using their books and rules.
2,The Fab Ethan Green,"Worth watching for an interesting, comic perspective on gay relationships and their regular ups and downs. Not too tacky and very well cast. The plot flows with ease and is not the least boring. Full marks to the cast and crew, many of whom are not gay. Cheers. Looking forward to seeing more like these."
3,Three stars,"I'm on two minds with this movie.First of all, it was never made to be dissected in search for moving themes; it was made to entertain and make you laugh. Has this been accomplished? I say yes!It's just a shame that it's a bit unrealistic at times and some of the acting seem forced.So here lies the dilemma. Should you buy it?I can't honestly say I regret buying it. I say rent it and decide if you're for the steamy kisses and hilarious backstories or the thin plot and substance.Three stars out of five for The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green"
4,Lighthearted and Funny,"Even though I haven't read the comic, I got a kick out of watching this movie. There are many funny moments that are candid and it's just one of those lightheated gay comedies that make me laugh and feel all warm and fuzzy inside.The acting isn't 100% but hey, all of the actors are cute! Daniel Letterle has come some way since Camp and even though he's fresh, he manages to pull off a very likeable character and even though he's sometimes over the top, convincingly plays a gay man (too bad he isn't!).I highly recommend this movie for a bit of a chuckle and just some great light comedy.If you liked this movie, I'm sure you will love The Broken Hearts Club."
1,"Manic, moronic, irritating, and boring. A truly terrible movie.","This movie is driven, frenetic, and entirely without any charm or humor at all. I forced myself to keep watching to the very end, but it was like having teeth pulled by a chimpanzee on speed. I'm going to break the DVD so I won't forget and end up watching it again by mistake. This is the worst movie I've seen in a very, very long time."
4,light comedy,"If you are interested in a light comedy. That's the movie. Beautiful people, fast talk, reasonable photography; but bad edit sometimes (ex: Ethan is smiling to camera B, and when it comes to camera A he is not.) The only ""real"" kiss is in the end. It is a good afternoon comedy. Not sure if it's worth buying it, though."
2,I realliy wanted to like this film...,"While it's got a good cast and nice production values for a indy film, it just never seems to come together. The tone is frequently way off (even odd), and sadly much of it seems to have been ""dumbed down"" for cheap laughs. It's too bad, it could have been a very good comedy."
3,Cute But Sorta Empty,"What a cute premise with cute guys and a story that moves pretty quickly. Even with Meredith Baxter giving an impressive and memorable performance as Ethan's witty and wise mother.But the pieces don't fit together very well and it's sort of all over the place, never really making any point or much sense. There is nothing here, really, that's very fresh or even very interesting. Having followed some of the comic strip, I certainly enjoyed it more in that venue.All told, it's not all bad, and is certainly worth a watch and good for a few light laughs, but there's always the sense that there's not much there besides the cute boys to be too entertained by. There's lots better gay-themed stuff than this."
4,Kinda corny but cute,"Its not a bad movie, its defiantly a gay movie. But my partner loves it and I like it. If you have a little extra money, but it, but buy a cheap one lol."
1,horrible- do not buy,"I bought this item and had it professionally installed. The product is horrible, the 'mist' that it claims is enough to corrode my HVAC unit, short out circuitboards and cost me close to $800 in parts to fix my HVAC unit.Given the choice between this and boiling water on my stovetop to humidify the place. I would go for the pot of water.I am only giving it one star because I dont have an option to give it zero."
2,Not For Every House,"Be sure this injection mist humidifier can work for you. Injection Mist Humidifiers caused standing water in my duct work, caused duct corrosion - even with galvanized metal ducts-, and water leaked through pin hole corrosion in the duct. My injector was within the installation distances - but the injector was still too close to surfaces where the humidified air water re-condensed - just as if a pair of eyeglasses placed above a pot of boiling water will cause water to condense on the cooler glass surface. I wish someone told me to be careful of this before water damaged furniture and replacement of ducts were need years latter."
3,Whole house Humidifier,Works well for a few years but then can malfunction and leak into your furnace. Had to have mine replaced.
4,Works,"You have to change out the sprayer head each year (about a $10 part), but other than that it appears to work well. I have had it for about 3 years. I installed it myself. I know it is increasing the humidity, because one year I had to replace a couple of the registers that had gotten a little bit of rust on them."
1,Great While it Lasts!,"I have had this machine for about four years. It has a great design that dresses up my countertop. The yellow color I selected complements my kitchen, and elicits compliments from guests. It made a good cup of expresso as well! Now the bad news. It overheated last week then the heating system completely shut down. Now the nightmare: it is almost impossible to get this thing fixed. There is an address in upstate New York for service but no customer service number or information. Not even a wbesite for customer service (just an email address.) For the money this thing costs you would think they would do better. Other comments idicates that any repairs would be difficult to obtain and expensive."
2,This machine will break and you will not be able to get it fixed!,"I bought this machine not even two years ago through the Illy a Casa program for my husband's 40th birthday. For about a year and a half, it worked well (and looked great too, except for the clock, which popped off and broke almost immediately). My husband loved it and I congratulated myself on getting him such a great gift. But one day the boiler overheated and that was it for the machine. When I tried to contact Francis Francis, I was only able to reach Illy. The machine was out of warranty, so it cost $10 for them to ship a box to me to have it FedEx'd to the service center. Before sending it in, I tried to find out how much I would be charged for the repair, but Illy could not provide an estimate; they did say it could be as much as $150. Not only that, they couldn't give me a number for Francis Francis customer service at all. So after just two years I am stuck with a very expensive and very broken machine. : ("
2,Good coffee while it lasted,"I'm giving this product a bad review for poor longevity but to its credit it did make pretty good coffee while it worked. I bought this espresso machine from Illy through it's Illy a Casa program spending only about $150 bucks on it.My machine just blew the boiler after only a year and a half. The cost of fixing the machine is going to be upwards of $150. I'd rather put that toward a new machine of higher quality. Had I paid $650 for this thing and it busted after only 18 months I'd be extremely pissed. Buyer beware, bad product for longevity!"
4,Basic Overview,"For a slim volume this book packs a lot of information. The Spanish Civil War is often called a prelude of World War II but in calling it that you really do it a disservice. The Spanish Civil War was a unique conflict in its own right, with many aspects, such as the International Brigades and the Condor Legion, which caused the war to have an impact far outside Spain's borders. This book gives a fairly nonpartisan assessment of the conflict, a treatment which is rare given the gut reactions many have towards the conflict based upon fascist and communist roles there. The photographs which illustrate are excellent as well but not overdoen, which explains how so much info got into such a small book."
4,"Quick, effective review of Civil War","This is a good book for who seek a brief introduction to the Spanish Civil War, but don't have time to wade through a 700-page history.Lannon handles this divisive war evenhandedly. She points out that both sides were somewhat co-opted by the movements of international communism and fascism and by the end of war, some no longer knew for what cause they were fighting.This book is subtitled, ""1936-1939."" Still, I wish Lannon had spent more time on the before and after of the war, rather than concentrating so much on the fighting.The book is well illustrated and designed, with posters, photos and maps on many pages."
4,Cutter's Way,"Stumbled across this movie by chance.All three leads are superb, giving the kind of charismatic, heroic, complex performances you so rarely see in Hollywood these days; the direction is deceptively simple, but subtly poetic and moving - it has the same kind of feel as the best of Milos Forman's American pictures (Cuckoo's Nest etc.), only with it's own gentle power.It's sort of a Film Noir/Character Study/Dropout Movie. Actually, waffling aside, it's just one of those movies you either clutch tightly to your breast after one viewing or aren't really going to care much for. Well, it got me and even though I'd like to think I found it first and it's my little secret, I know that's not true... Anyway, watch and enjoy; it's not perfect, it may not actually be great, but it should stab you in the heart a little, and take you on the kind of quirky, bumpy ride you might just need! Give it a try........"
5,Cutter King,"The alcoholic, blasphemous and ""crippled"" Cutter would not please Arnold fans. But for his crowd, he pulls out a heartbreaking display of bravery and follows his paranoia until the very end.We have seen men like him on screen before, but they lacked the willingless to sacrifice themselves in pursuit of re-gaining self respect and the ability to turn ""no-good"" bystanders (Bone) in the process.The off beat pace of the movie, the underacting and its noir tones very successfully dims the gut wrenching drama at play, without affecting the suspense.The suspense? There is more of it in wondering where the Cutter's relentless path to self-destruction might lead to than in solving the murder mystery at play.Simply worth watching for John Heard's perfect depiction of Cutter. Bridges (Bone) and Eichhorn are excellent as well."
2,Disappointing in characterizaion,"Having grown up with ""Gunsmoke,"" I was excited about the prospect of reading stories featuring the characters of the series. I expected something similar to the books that use the ""Star Trek"" characters in which relationships are explored and developed, where the past is explained and there is an effort to carry on continuity in the characters' lives. This is the second in the series and so far, it appears that the author doesn't seem to care about Matt, Miss Kitty and Doc because he doesn't seem to know much about them. In the first book of the series, Festus even reads a newpaper. In the second, Matt actually asks Kitty to marry him? The plots, although fairly standard, aren't objectionable. The characterization is what is off the mark. I hope the series continues but maybe the author should watch some more reruns."
2,Dillon was a UNITED STATES marshal !,"For Gunsmoke fans who crave tidbits of romantic verbal interplay between Matt and Kitty, this book is worth the reading. However, there are glaring character discrepancies, such as Festus's accent, grammar, and ability to read. Worse was the major plot device which contended that Matt was a lawman chosen by the town council and thus could be dismissed by them!"
3,Too good grammar,"For those of you who enjoyed the Gunsmoke show, you will enjoy the book as well. For those who were and are complete fans of the show and can't get enough, you may not like the book as well. The story is quite good, but the characters speak close to perfect english at times, making the book less believable. I would like to see more development of the main characters and perhaps we will see that is future books. I hope there are more."
5,"This is THE version of the ""Archduke"" trio to have","This is just too beautiful to describe. There is also the 2CD set but if you are only interested in a 1 CD containing the best piano trios of Beethoven, this is IT."
5,Briliant Opus,"This is one of the best black metal releases of the 90s. This goes to same gategory as Mayhem's De Mysteriis..., Emperor's Anthems..., Satyricon's The Shadowthrone. Just listen to the first song of album, To Thou Who Dwellest In The Night and you can't stop listening the whole album. After you have heard it once, you just want to play it again and again. This masterpiece contains 8 songs and 41.31 of brilliance and it cames in nice digipak. Buy it and Buy it now."
3,good black metal gone prog-rock,"Sort of a black metal supergroup, comprised of members of various insane Norwegian black metal bands. This band isn't really black metal though, but more like evil progressive rock, with lots of keyboards and some acoustic guitar. Speedy drumming, weak production, and the miserable, croaking vocals keep you reminded that these guys come from black metal bands. Some chanting vocals add a little variety. Overall, this a very good piece of music if you're looking for something artsy and atmospheric."
5,Excellent Hammer,I give it a 5 star because it is a hammer built of good quality and it serves its purpose. It was a quick transition and delivery on time.
3,Gunmen and Outlaws,A good book that gives a thumbnail sketch of some of the important Old West gunfighters. The artwork is good and the description of the subjects is a good start for those interested in research of these people but it is not very deep. I found this book to be worth it's price.
3,"Good book, but not the same cover.",The cover of the book I received did not match the one that was in the picture. I was a little disappointed but the book itself is the same. I purchased this to replace one that I got as a child on vacation with my family. It was one of my favorites but after 20 something years....it was kind of rough looking. All in all okay with my purchase just wished the covers were the same. Thank you.
5,THE BEST PURCHASE I'VE EVER MADE!!!,"even though i'm a kid, and you'll probably think i don't know anything about music, i know that this is a excellent cd. this is definetly the best buy i've ever have and ever will make. the screamer is very good at his job and is soooooooo talented. the guitar and special effect people are very very good players and make all their music excellent (other than good drums and vocals). when you get this album then you have to listen to ""He Died Of..."". if you don't like this album then you're messed up. SO GO AND BUY IT!!!"
3,Good Starter Reference,"Very Nice Atlas to get started on your adventure to connect the dots of history in the Holy Lands and Who, What, When."
2,Madd Nation,I think the albums cool they did there thing. I espesialy liked the producers.I wounder what going to happen with them now?
5,Long-lasting battery,"I purchased this battery for my husband's Samsung camera which took the CP1 Duracell Battery which I could only find online and it was very expensive. I decided instead to purchase three rechargeable batteries and the charger so he would always have an extra, charged battery. He used it for the first time at a weekend event and it worked great! He didn't have to change the first battery until after the first day!! Very satisfied with this item and received it quickly."
2,Intense yet somewhat overated,"It is defintley a very intense album but they dont even come close to reaching the brilliance of Meshuggah.Gene Hoglan's finest drumming is also left back in the days of Death where he worked with a truely magnificent and talented musician, Chuck Schuldiner, Devin Townsend really doesn't come close to Chuck's superb orchestrations and talent in song writing and guitar playing."
1,Boring nu-metal,"This isn't heavy at all. I thought it would be heavier than bands like Origin and Nile, but sadly I got something that is barely heavier than slipknot. Buy Crimson Thorn instead of the pop music crud."
5,Very Fast and lots of sound effects KILLER!,"I liked this album, it was awsome. Especially since I am from Victoria,they have been here a couple of times to play and they rock live! Don't got it? It is worth getting!"
2,Not what I expected,"When I began reading this book, I thought, ""Oh my, this must this poor woman's first attempt at writing."" Then I learned that she has written others ... Grammatical mistakes aside, this book was not what I'd expected. I was looking for a book on gardening folklore. There is some of that, but it is arranged more like an old Farmer's Almanac, by month. There seems to be no real rhyme or reason as to how things were added, and I got a little tired of the religious references that are peppered throughout. I will continue to look for the type of book I had in mind. This book does have some interesting information, if you can find it buried within the text. There are also some very old recipes that look intriguing. I am giving two stars as follows: one because the woman completed the text; another because she managed to find someone to publish it."
2,"Hey, you need a better singer!!!","ICED EARTH is a great band, but as long as they cntinue to be harassed by perpetual line-up changes and by singer Matthew Barlow, they will not go very far. BArlow has a special and unique voice, but simply does not know how the put the lyrics into the music (maybe that is Schaffer's blame... he's the main sngwriter).THe vocal department of ICED EARTH, the best American heavy metal band, is disappointing."
4,Days of Purgatory,"Okay, let me just start off by saying that this isn't a greatest hits album and however that rumor started, I have no idea. This is simply a CD (or if you have the import, a 2 CD) of remakes of their older stuff with Matt Barlow instead of the other idiots they had before him. Also, let me say that this in nowhere near their best work and if you think it is, you haven't listened to Burnt Offerings of The Dark Saga enough! To start off, these songs weren't too great to begin with, but are however given a new zest when added with Matt Barlow's voice. This CD is a pure collectable. It's unneccessary, but it's fun to have and listen to the changes that are made. The CD is good, but it's kind of stupid to say that it's a greatest hits album."
3,Reminds my of old school heavey metal,I bought 2 of their discs to try them out.I played each disc 4 or 5 times in a row to try and get that song that would catch me but no go.I really like the music but in my opinion the vocals are just ok. Far from the Bruce's and Rob's out there!
3,Could be great with a little redesigning.,"I used these for a while on my mother, but I have gone back to disposables. I will save these for use in an emergency. The main problem with getting a good fit is the lack of any cut-ins at the center for the thighs. I only used them at night because they were always so bunched up in the crotch area. If they were to make these with a full moisture barrier, and utilise an ""H"" pattern shape, they would have a easier to use product."
2,too big,It was so big and bulky that it pushed my head forward in the seat.they should give us the dimensions. I dont like it is so bad deal
4,best travel pillow I've used!!,"I bought this pillow because we were driving from New York to Florida (non-stop). I have used other pillows before on previous trips and this one is the BEST!! It is firm but soft at the same time. The key to this design is that it snaps together in the front so it doesn't SLIP AWAY from you as you sleep. So glad I found this pillow. Does have a ""smell"" to it, but just air it out before you use it."
5,the best of them all,"After years of watching my father fall asleep in his chair, with his head all askew, I purchased one of these for his Christmas. He uses it all the time!!! And I just got one for myself. These truly are the best out there. The clever little snap keeps it in place and makes all the difference in the world. A great product and a great value!"
1,Too Big & Bulky!,"I bought this Obus Forme Memory Foam Travel (Neck) Pillow for a long flight in coach seating... turned out to be useless and very uncomfortable! It was so big and bulky that it pushed my head forward in the seat, even in the reclined position. It ended up taking up most of the room in my carry-on bag, making it very inconvienent to lug around. What a waste of money and precious luggage space!!!"
3,Too thick,this in theory would be a great pillow but its just too thick and unless you have a desirable yet rare swan neck this may not be the pillow for you.I have what I feel is an average length neck and the thickness of this pillow makes it just too much to get comfy-I received it last week and then flew 15hrs and this pillow ended up not being of use-had to use a funky plane pillow-blech.
1,"Too little support, poor construction","I didn't like this product at all. The whole problem with sleeping when you travel is the inability to recline fully. As a result, your head tends to fall forward. A good travel pillow should prevent this from happening. Unfortunately, this one does not. Since it snaps in front, there is *zero* chin support. I tried using it backwards, but it would slide down my chest because of the lack of body in back.Worse, the construction is cheap. The velour cover on the memory foam became frayed within three months of purchase, with very light use. I think this product is poorly made, and doesn't even work as advertised before it breaks."
2,Not soft enough,"It's a nice idea to have a travel pillow made of memory foam, but this pillow just didn't cut it. It's way too bulky for airline travel. The width of the pillow pushed my head forward in an already cramped seat. Save your money and purchase a travel pillow made of a material that is more easily compressed."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed with this product. After reading so many great reviews, I decided to purchase this product for my flight to Asia. The pillow is too hard, and the neck area was too large for my neck. I used it instead to prop up against the window. The pillow may work better for a larger, taller person."
1,NetNanny Chat Monitor,This was perhaps one of the WORST products I have ever tried to install on my computer. They have NO technical support at all. If you have a problem all they tell you is to do is un-install then re-install the product.This product failed to install and failed to monitor my children's chats. I reached out 4 or 5 times for help and got nothing. I will tell anyone I can NOT to waste their money on this product.SAVE YOUR MONEY.... GET ANOTHER PRODUCT.. NOT THIS ONE !!!
1,Unreliable,"I didn't have any problems loading the software, but it isn't recording all of the chat sessions. The summary report says that there were 35 sessions, yet only 10-15 files are sent. It is incapable of properly recording ICQ chats, even though it claims it can. Information at the website indicates that there is a patch to ""ungarble"" ICQ chats, but when I attempted to load the patch I received a message that my software was already up to date. I wrote to tech support, got an auto response, but never heard from them again. Internet Explorer crashes constantly on each of the computers that I have installed this software on, and we weren't having that problem prior to installation. I am uninstalling it and looking for something else."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this item without reading the reviews and now I'm kicking myself for getting it. It doesn't record the full conversations like it said it would. It's a big waste of time and money!
3,Fits preschool heads,"If you have a ""Bob the Builder"" fan, and wish to buy them a real hard hat (as opposed to toy one that does not offer protection), this hat will do the trick. The instructions for fitting the headgear into the helmet were hard to follow, so you kind of have to look at the head-strap insert and look at the inside of the helmet and figure out how to insert it. Maybe four minutes of puzzling. But it only fits one way, so you are unlikely to get it wrong.The hat is not quite as durable as more expensive hard hats - don't drop anvils on it. But it should absorb hits from hammers and rocks and the sort of thing that three-year old construction engineers are likely to dish out or receive."
5,perfect,"Exactly as pictured and described. Cheap and quality, cant beat that. This hard hat was brought for costume however it serves well for work with no separation from eployee provided hard hats."
4,seems flimsy,"I bought the hard hat on price. I am a sales rep that visits alot of plants and needed my own hard hat instead of borrowing the customers all the time.The hard hat fits my head fine, but the clips seem really really cheaply made. Overall happy with the hard hat"
4,Get the JOB done but..,the main problem i had was why it didnt just come ready build why i had to put it togather my self
2,Boring & Dry,"Maxime Schwartz was a molecular biologist and is now a professor at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Schwartz traces the history of medical research into spongiform encephalopathies, and how the scientific understanding of how they are spread has changed over time. If you know anything about Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) or Mad Cow disease, I don't think you'll learn anything new in this book. How the Cows Turned Mad is not a sensational book, nor even a good book. Quite simply it is too wordy and dull."
5,Does it's job well,We purchased this one as well as the smaller size and extension pole and are very satisfied. The soft rubber lip does a great job cleaning mirrors and windows.
3,the american way to bananas,"If you are desparately seeking the ""riders of the storms"" like I am, buy this DVD at once.I had an old french SECAM VHS tape of the movie lost somewhere in the attic and never watched it since... (oh my god !)I loved this movie since day one !BUT :The video quality sucks. That's why I gave it only a 3-star rate.If your are planing on replacing your old VHS by this DVD, don't buy this because it seems to be VHS master.Now it's up to you to decide what to do. Remember the WHO's song (and others), the Eugene Lipinsky's wheelchair, Michael J Pollard going bananas, Dennis Hopper as the ""captain"". All together stuck in a bomber with this last job :Find the dirt to put Mrs Westinghouse off her inauguration."
2,Not what it used to be,"We loved our old foodsaver, and used it constantly for several years until it gave up the ghost, and we replaced it with this one.Those who are familiar with the Foodsaver and are thinking of getting this one should be prepared for disappointment. This machine's seal strip is now much further away from the vacuum chamber, meaning you lose a full 1.5 to 2 inches of bag at the top each time you seal. It used to be much less than this.Also, this machine is infuratingly picky about the top of the bag being precisely placed in the vacuum chamber, and if you're using a used bag that's been through the dishwasher (as they say you can), you can just throw it away -- these bags have never sealed a second time.Overall, we're sorry we bought it, and pine away for the old one."
3,difficult to use,"I'm not happy with this particular model. It does make a good seal, but it takes a LOT Of pressure to hold that thing down to get it to seal. It's tiring!And, sometimes it won't start to seal ... for some reason (the bag isn't in the exact right spot) it doesn't think it's done sucking and i think ""good enough! seal already"" . You can 'just' tell it to seal anyway ... but since I have to be pressing so hard with two hands to keep it working, this requires a 2nd person!I've used my sisters and it isn't so difficult, so I'd buy a different model."
2,Dissatisfied,"I did not receive the $100 coupon for accessories that the description promised. Amazon said to contact manufacturer which I did. They said they will only give coupons if bought directly from them and that Amazon is responsible for what they promise, not Tilia. Dissatisfied with false advertising more than the actual product."
4,Gere is good in this,"This movie is worth watching; however, if you've seen the Bourne Trilogy or read any of Ludlum's other books, it may seem trite by comparison. So don't compare it. Just sit back and enjoy the entertainment."
4,Surprising Ride,"I love a good spy movie and this fits the bill. Just enough intrigue and twists to keep the story interesting. The acting was just fine, and the plot took a couple of unexpected turns. Good entertainment and well worth streaming on a Saturday night."
3,Not terrible if you bored and looking for a spyish movie,"Yes it is predictable, yes it is comes across as low budget with an odd mix of actors, but it is mildly entertaining. I would not buy it, but I would recommend it as a rental on a Sunday night when nothing else seems appealing."
4,The Double,Almost always love Richard Gere...This was a great movie and Grace was excellent along with story line. Really enjoyed this movie.
2,Not a great movie,"It's not a movie I would recommend to others to view. Although I like Richard Gere, it's not one of his better movies."
5,very exciting and enjoyable,There was suspense and surprises. Richard G. did some of his best acting portraying this story. All of our family enjoyed this film.
4,Kept me Guessing,"Richard Gere and Topher Grace are good in this crime thriller about spies, Soviet assassin and such. I knew nothing about this film when I started watching it and was pleasantly surprised by the whole movie. This is one of the best things I have seen Richard Gere do in a long time and think the role is perfect for him. Topher Grace is great as the up and coming FBI kid who knows all about the man they are looking for. Twist and turns from start to end kept me guessing what might happen and who was who, just the kind of mystery I like.Take a look if this is your type of film and you will not be disappointed."
5,A must see!,All I can say is that this is a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Never a dull moment!
3,could have been better,"Expected more from this dvd with Richard Gere, but this was a little disappointing for me, think this is the worst I have seen him in."
5,awesome.,"Great movie. i really enjoy watching this movie,have a lots of action and some drama too.Richard gere did a good job keeping you in suspense . Is a good movie from beginning to end ."
2,the cast is wasted,"Topher, find a good script. Quick. Before you disappear. No mystery to this one. The ending, twists included came as no surprise. And how old is Gere's character supposed to be?"
4,Great Movie,Really high-intense and must pay attention. I did not move off the couch during this film. The ending blew me away; will watch this one again.
5,The Double,"An intreging plot which doesn't give itself away. The ending is a real supprise and satisfying. One of Gere's more satisfying works and is reminiscent of ""NoWay Out"""
1,boot leg copy,I played this DVD and it had no previews on it also the sticker on the DVD was off set a bit and the cover was clearly a print out. Because it was AN ILLEGAL copy my DVD player was unable to use TVG to block out the swearing.
2,Not worth viewing,"Most have been said here regarding the content. I found this movie highly predicatble, boring with a weak overall story. The only one that provides some kind of aura and class to the movie is Richard Geere. Other than that the movie is a waste of time. Comparable stories like this one has shown on TV seen a million times; the russian spy motive is outdated in my opinion anyways. In terms of Spy Movies nothing comes close to Bourne Trilogy in my opinion, ""The double"" is light years away. An episode of Criminal Intend is more exciting."
2,Gere with Grace - good grief!,"You need to get out more if a cardboard, cut-out thriller like this impresses you. This made-in-Michigan espionage potboiler plays like a crappy, cable-TV action show. Gere is anemic and Grace once again proves he's nothing but a mannequin; Sheen is barely there. It doesn't even offer the exploitive charms that lots of cheap action flicks generally deliver."
1,This movie is unbelievably bad...,A story that makes little sense and a bunch of actors that obviously turned up for the pay check. The budget obviously went in to the second rate cast. Everything is shot in some unused warehouse or slum. Gere just gets worse as he gets older. Behold one of the worse death scenes ever. Guess those guys in Dubai got sold a bill of goods by some Hollywood producer. This is the worse kind of awful in that it thinks it is smart. Vampire Bill - go back to Bonn Temps!
1,Martin Sheen remarks and affliations are still remembered,"Anything Martin Sheen is involved in is immediately discarded by many of my generation!!!!He is in the same group of unpatriotic,easily influenced as Jane the tank rider F o n d a .Boooooooooooooooooooo!"
5,An absolute must have for hardie board siding,"I really like this tool, I did have to get use to cutting straight with it at first but you get use to it and I always cover up my cut ends anyway so it wasn't too bad. There is no dust when you use it, it zips right through with hardly any effort at all. The manual says not to use it on 1/2"" hardie board, but it does still cut through it quite well (I don't know if it will affect the longevity of the tool or not though). It was well worth the price, it paid for itself within 2 weeks or less."
4,Works suitably well,"Major advantage - no need for goggles or dust mask.Some reviews have given this tool a miracle rating. It's a good tool but has it's drawbacks.This tool cuts Hardie siding in the same fashion as a pair of Kett shears cut sheet metal. It does chip a little so not all cuts are as clean as some have stated. Lengthwise cuts are very slow and tedious, I switched back to the circular saw for these. Plus it is unable to trim small sections off the edge without chipping and tearing - deal with this by flipping the piece so the cut edge is on the top when starting from a slanting surface. Some clean up with a rasp or knife is necessary.All in all your lungs will thank you."
5,Worth the money,"Decided to try a shear on my second house. Used a combination of score and snap along with a Diablo hardiplank blade for the first house and it was very labor intensive. The blade worked OK in the chop saw but it burned up fast when ripping boards. No teeth were left after less than a fourth of a house. Used the shear on the house I am working on now and it is 10 times faster. Using it is a lot like using a saber saw. You have to watch the line. Speed wise, I could not ask for more. I was able to rip a full length plank in less than 30 seconds with no dust. Edges are not bad, and I discovered if you cut from the back side, the front finish looks almost as good as a saw cut. Cut is way better looking than score and snap. Even for part time builders, it is worth the money."
4,Fiber cement shears,"This shear works well and curls a 1/4-inch strip instead of creating dust. It sometimes smashes the edge of the fiber cement plank instead of a clean cut - not sure why this happens, I have been trying various methods of support to stop this. A pass or two with a rasp cleans up the edge if needed. It actually cuts very quickly. I have only used it on 5/16-inch siding boards."
4,ss404 steel head fiber cement shear,"I have finished using this shear and must say it is excellent. Good tools are always worth the extra money. This tool is well made, fit and finish is perfect for this type of tool. You will get a better cut by having the good side down, but still cuts well either side. I also bought the jigs for hardie plank. These jigs are also good to have if you are working alone. The jigs are not perfect, but they are cheaper than paying for another person. You should pay attention to your measurements when using the jigs, as they sometimes move. You also have to install the first two courses before they will work, unless you have at least 12"" from the bottom of the first course. Also a word about Amazon, the delivery time was two days....awsome........"
2,P&P Book,"The book I purchased was NEW. But, when I received it the book had water spots and dirty finger prints through out. Lots of!"
3,service was not good,I ordered 3 of them. One of them did not work. They made me pay for the shipment of sending back the defective item.
4,"Works fine. Seems a little pricey for a ""switch""","This is basically a switch. It works as advertised. Comes with great labels for all the rooms you could ever need to label. You would use this one for a higher powered amp. Still, it seems a little expensive for what it does, but it does serve a good niche purpose and it does so very well."
1,Practically Useless.,Used these on a computer built. Maybe they could work for securing speaker wire... That would be about it. Adhesive is some of the worse i've seen. Think i'll get some 3m two-sided tape from a hardware store and replace the adhesive included to make up for my loss. Maybe the 3/4 or inch sized ones would work better?
2,Not sticky enough,"I purchased these things to have some anchors in order to tie up some cables on a temporary basis. The problem I had with these is that they are too temporary...they just don't stick where I need them to.I tried to stick these on clean plastic surfaces inside my vehicle, but they just didn't stick long at all. It may be the surface I was trying to stick them to, but for me, they just didn't work."
2,Good!,"These are very small and work great for small wiring. I used them for low voltage under cabinet lighting wires. Ordered the small 4"" tie wraps to go with them. They hold very well, the only con is that it is very hard to get the wrapper off the double sided tape."
1,Contents?,"In case you're wondering what the hell is actually in this set, it's visible on the third cover image above. Come on Amazon, do your stuff please."
3,Didn't live up to its potential,"This book is quite mysterious and intriguing, yet in the final analysis something seems to be missing. The powerful imagery of the ""resurrection"" of the men building the tunnel under the river is very suggestive and pulls the reader in, but much of the book is murky. I suppose this is appropriate considering how much of it takes place in tunnels-- symbolic of an underworld existence. Also it was interesting how questions of identity impelled the plot. But although I admired the style and the symbolism, it was hard for me to connect emotionally with the book.Martin Cruz Smith's ""Rose"" describes tunnels and working in coal mines in such a frightening way that many other descriptions of tunnels seem tame to me. This historical mystery is extremely well-written for its genre."
2,Reach exceeds grasp,"The author is clearly a talented writer, but this is not a fully realized novel. MCCann seems to be reaching.... Maybe next time."
4,Haunting tale of three generations,"The way McCann weaves two storylines into one is amazing. He keeps you guessing until the very end. A terrific commentary on the evolution of New York, as well."
4,poetry in underground prose,"Never really worked out why I enjoy Colum McCann so much. His plots slide gently along, until the occasional crowbar needs to be inserted to keep them on track. A storyline was telegraphed very early on - past meets present to shape the future. The profundities are in the way what he writes catches you up short. It is often poetry made into prose, with all the packed meaning and instant empathy of a good line of poetry inserted into some wonderfully smooth prose writing. The portrayal of life underground was, for me, a little too wrought, too crafted with dream too conveniently slipping in and out of reality - and maybe edging towards caricature, and I wasn't totally convinced or reassured by an interview with the author I heard on BBC Radio 4. That's all the caveats. Would recommend this book to anyone on the lookout for remarkable imagery and lyrical writing - and look forward to the next."
2,"Hard to put together and not much ""umph""","I bought this toy not knowing it rode by itself with the push of a button. Nowhere in the description does it explain this. It was shipped to me pretty quickly, which was nice, but the directions to assemble it were not clear at all, and the battery compartment was really hard to screw off, even for my husband. The decals were cheap and most of them tore when I tried peeling them off to adhere to the car. If my daughter wants to just ride on it without using the button to make it run, it is very noisy. When she pushes the button, it rides itself, but goes very slow and is very loud. The only thing that she really likes about this so far is the fireman hat that came with it--she wears it all the time. I would not purchase this again. If I had purchased this in a store, I would have returned it. Don't waste your time or money on this thing."
2,they tried.....but they failed,"This movie would have been not bad if it was 30 minutes long...What we have here is the right ingredients but not the right formula.We have pretty good gore, a monster...not too bad of a rubber suit, andso so actors. I knew the film was in trouble when we had close up breastshots at the beginning...that lasted a bit too long.......and why after pumping a million bullets in this creature,,,the actors are still shooting at it....as you see there are problems....and before the end of the film ...youwill probably shut your dvd player off.....to spare you more pain..."
3,"A bad movie, but watch it anyway","I think the people who give this movie a bad review are missing the point. It stars Lorenso Lamas and went straight to DVD, so of course the plot is bad and the effects are horrible, but that's part of the charm. Everything about this movie, from the acting, to the effects to the plot, to everthing else are bad, that it's fun to watch. If you like to do MST3K at home, you will like this movie. If you want to watch Aliens, then skip this and just watch Aliens."
1,300 year old Cockroach from Space Wrecks Chopper,"This was the most pathetic excuse for a movie ever made. My god. I wasted $20 on this crap.It's about some invisible creature who can only be seen if someone shoots paintball at it. It eats gold, lives in a cave and looks like a scarecrow.The worst part of this movie is that it REALLY takes itself seriously. They HONESTLY think that this movie has a point. Just look at the scene where they shoot the bat? They put some ridicilous MIDI music (MIDI!! they use MIDI files throughout the WHOLE movie) which is supposed to make us feel worried for the characters. Honestly.. I think anyone who starts watching the movie will hope that EVERYONE dies (and they do).The inteview with ""THE MOSTER"" is nothing more but some pathetic idiot wearing a mask talking about his childhood.Only recommend it to your arch-enemy.They have"
1,alien 3000,I am nine years old and most kids would probably like alien 3000 but I thought that it had horrible graphics and a stupid plot.I loved the alien serries with sugorney weaver and aliens was my favorit movie of all time but alien 3000 was so stupid that it is on my top 10 least favorit movie list.the director of alien 3000 used to make good movies but he really screwed up on this one.The creature was what gave the movie such bad reviews. The alien looked so man like and stupid that it looked like a monster from a b movie.I personly do not reccomend this movie to any horror fans because it is just a wast of time !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
1,Eah,"The movie is a good idea but like its prequal ""unseen evil"" the production and DVD value is incredibly low. Poor filming and horrid script made it a film that not-even cable will show again. The story is a survivor of the first film is contracted by the government to work with mercenaries to find and capture this alien entity. First, last i checked the US government has no need to contract mercenaries, we have the largest and most trained army in the world. The second thing i found really annoying is the aliens shape. We see about three different body-suits used for the alien and its cloaking is a bad omage of the predator movies. All in all the film was to bad for me to completly finish as it was to agonizing and the DVD picture quality and sound was below an awful bootleg."
1,Not very good...,"I wasn't expecting much though so I'm not crushed. I only rented this flick to see what Richard Hatch has been doing between Battlestar Galacticas. Fairly simple b- horror movie. Cindi Braun wasn't terrible, really. But Hatch was kind of all over the place. Sometimes he was good, other times not so much. Same with the special effects. Some were good, but when they were bad, they were really bad. Not very rememberable at all."
2,UNSEEN SCRIPT,"BATTLESTAR GALACTICA'S Richard Hatch has aged well...that's all I can say. His acting in this is so bad, it looks like he had constipation the whole time he's on screen. The special effects are cartoon worthy, circa 1979. The script, what little there is, derives all its horror from countless B movies of the 50s and 60s without the flair and charm they possessed.This is really a pretty lame flick!"
1,Bad movie,"This is the type of horror movie they made back in the old days. i.e. low budget, bad acting, guy in a fake looking rubber monster suit. The concepts for this movie were likely copied from Alien, Predator, and Independence day. The DVD cover's alien looks similar to the creature from the Alien movies, however the actual movie's alien looks different from the DVD cover. The alien can become invisible like the creature from Predator. One scene was obviously copied from Independence day (the alien has it's tentacle around the dead scientists neck, making the scientist's body say ""...r e l e a s e... m e...""). Perhaps the alien may have been more believable if it had been filmed under dim lighting conditions, however views of the alien were in full daylight making it obviously a badly designed fake rubber monster suit.The special features consists of an interview with the director who is wearing a rubber monster mask. I guess I would also hide my face if I were involved with making this movie."
4,Fun B-Movie,"My friend and I watched this movie the other day and really liked it. If you are into B-movie, horror movies, you will really have some fun with this one. It has a lot of action, suspense, aliens, a scary monster, a wisecracking black guy and cool dude Tim Thomerson. Unfortunately, the only nudity was at the beginning with a naked Indian girl, but there is a hot blonde girl who is there throughout the movie who makes it worth watching even with her clothes on. It also has a great surprise ending which I won't give away. We give it two thumbs up!"
2,Don't Waste Your Time,This movie is the dumbest horrier movie I've seen since Jeepers Creepers.Of caorse there was blood in gore which was cool but I like those movies but this was rediclous.It's about a guy named Peter and a crew of 4 go hiking to find a native cave to find out about the past.When they go into the cave a mysterious monster is awaked.This may sound cool but it's not!The monster is a type of a cartoon type thing.ALEINS had a lot cooler alien then this!I mean the giphs were total just drawn as pictures which was bogus.Now adays people can still use a flat tire and go for some miles I mean that since my familys done that.A lot of stupid things happen here.Watch it if you want too but take my advice and don't.For all the people who don't want to waste their money.
1,Can't get much worse,"I thought that there isn't a movie out there that can make me truly hate it so much that I can get off my seat and leave. But this movie did. Within the first 15 minutes of bad acting, cheesy gore, very bad CGI and crappy dialogue I couldn't continue watching it. It is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I thought nothing would change my opinion after M. Night's Signs. But it did. Don't waste your 5 bucks renting it."
1,A Cheap ripoff of the original Alien.,"I bought this dvd cause the cover's alien was extremely similar to the alien in the original Alien movies. BIG MISTAKE. L.Lamas was in this movie for may be 10 mins. tops. The Alien is nothing like the photo on the cover and it, of course is nothing like the Alien movies. The cover said a ""new breed of predator"" This movie is the stupidist movie I have ever seen. IT IS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MY MONEY AND MY TIME. !!! If there was a way to do it - I would rate it in the minus ( - ) instead of the + column ...SO DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE..."
1,Horrid,"this movie seriously stinks, spend 90 minutes of your life doing something else, riding your bike or reading a book, even listening to Clay Aiken or Celine Dion is more pleasurable. First this movie has no connection with the ""Alien"" movies. The story makes little sense, the alien is about as scary as anyone on the WWE. The actors go from intense overacting (the Phoebe character esp.) to not acting at all (Lorenzo Lamas and anyone in the OPI). The only redeeming portion of the movie is the beginning there is actually some nudity that is interesting, but it goes downhill as soon as they enter the cave and find the treasure. I found myself watching it with spanish subtitles to justify wasting my time on it (I was at least keeping up with my spanish). If I had to choose between this movie and having to stand in leech infested water, I would choose the leeches"
3,Simply adicting!,"I have to say that the *Ateens are simply addicting! I was ver much a big fan of there first album (The Abba Generation) and so that's what pulled me into this album! I cannot say I like or Dislike this album because i'm tempted to listen to it all the time but yet I cannot stand to put my ears threw so much pain! The constant Screaming and loud booms of base will either make you wanna do a (vanilla Ice) and smash this album with a baseball bat or you will find yourself going insane for the horrible 60 minutes that the album last. But I had to give the album 3 stars for the 3 tracks that are standable which are (Firefly), (Slammin Kinda Love) & (All My Love) So if your like me you would like to know how this album really is if you could only stand to listen to it!"
1,Not so original,"Coming from Sweden myself im embarrased about A-Teens. A group that does nothing else then pure Teen-pop. Cheesy, annoying lyrics is their trade mark, but the main reason they sell is their not so original name A-Teens. Originally it was even Abba-Teens but cause of the right's they had to remove that. Still nothing could stop them from making a million of Abba covers. Nah there's not much positive things about this album, the only one i can thing of is that they for once didn't make any covers, however the songs chosen are far from good pop music."
1,DEMOSTRARON QUE NO SIRVEN,"Una vez mas demostraron que no sirven. No son nada originales, por ende no traen nada nuevo al mercado de la música pop. Solamente sirvieron para recordarles al mundo lo que una vez fue ABBA. Pero hasta ahí. De hecho no son tan ""internacionales"" como los hacen ver. Solamente lo conocen en latinoamérica, USA, y su país de origen Suecia, otros mercados internacionales de la música ni siquiera los han tomado en cuenta."
4,Fab 2nd Album!,"As we all know, the A*Teens are completely wonderful. Their first album was totally the bomb. They took the great disco vibes of Abba and added a techno beat to bring them speeding into the new generation of dance clubbers. But, if you thought the first album was good, than this one will rock your world. Fab dance beats like in the song ""Halfway Around the World"" and even beautiful love ballads like the song ""Firefly."" And, the best thing about the album is that it's all original songs. You finally get to hear what the A*Teens really have to offer. The guys even have solos!"
5,I love this CD!,"I love this CD! I got it because I LOVE the song ""Bouncing off the ceiling upside down"" and I ended up loving ALL the songs on the album! The A-Teens are great and I think they're very talented!"
4,This CD rox!!!,"It doesn't have the best songs on it, but it also has some really kewl songs on it too and they totally rock! (I haven't seen 'em in concert tho, but I want to), and Amit is kinda cute. My fave songs are Halfway 'Round the World, and That's What (It's All About). Even my mom thinks they'd be kewl to see in concert, usually she doesn't like the ppl that I go to see in concert 'cept plus One and *Nsync. KTAPA!¡"
3,A-Teens: pop-music made in Sweden,"After the BOY BANDS boom, in the late 90's, the media, and specially, the teenager fans, were a little 'nauseate' about those bands.So, four ""cute"" teenagers came out to the pop music scenery, singing sweet songs, dancing ultra-choreographed street dance...They would be just another pop-band, except by a sutle difference: they music, their choreography, is all made in Sweden.A-teens' musics remembers me another great band from Sweden, the Ace of Base. Lyrics talk about love and friendship. Melodies are hypnotic, and, in my opinion, has some ""spiritual"" or ""mystical"" beat, from that Nordic country."
5,This cd...,When my friend told me about this I knew I was going to hate the cd but now I JUST LOVE this cd. It is soo good!
2,"SUGAR RUSH DOESN""T BELONG TO A*TEENS!","Dream Street Has a Song Called ""Sugar Rush"" also, BUT, It was recorded BEFORE the A*Teens' song and the A*teens didn't even Take all lyrics correctly! I STRONGLY suggest you check out Dream Street's Version Because it's longer,better the lyrics make more sense..and it just sounds better! They Shood Just stick with ABBA songs instead of Dream Street's"
5,teen spirit,The teens' second album. This time they're singung their own songs. Only one song i know they remake and that is Sugar rush original by Dream Street. I think A-Teens do a much better job at singing it than DS.
5,One of the best dance CDS!,this is one of the best CDS ever!Halfway 'round the worldSuger RushUpside down bouncing off the ceilingThose 3 are my ultimate favs!!You have got to buy this CD if you love to dance!
1,Oh please!!,"This is so bad. I will be surprised if anyone older than 13 would buy this CD. Why not buy the real stuff, ABBA, instead of these wannabies...emberassing!!"
5,I feel 18 again!!!!,I bought this CD for my daughter but find myself listening to it when alone. The music is energetic and literally transports me back to my high school days and makes me feel 18 years old again!!!Go for it!!!
1,DONT BUY ANY THING FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!,They have misleading product info and are not cooperative when you try to return something. I had to pay 50$ to return items that were not compatible!
5,MIRIAM HASKELL JEWELRY (SCHIFFER BOOK),This is a fantastic resource book for the Vintage Jewelry Collector or Seller. It is wonderfully organized & beautifully illustrated with many large color pictures. The descriptions are concise & precise. Values are given after each description.There is also a wonderful & informative section on Identifying & Dating Haskell Jewelry~vintage to present~including clasps & materials. This section also has clear close-up photographs.I feel it is an invaluable tool for the serious collector. And well worth the investment!
4,Great resource,For anyone interested in Miriam Haskell jewelry this is a tremendous asset. It is a thorough description of her line from beginning to the present and includes beautiful pictures making identification easier.
3,Name-Dropping,"Gertrude Stein is a remarkably fine writer, and can at times drop memorable anecdotes. But there is no plot in this book, just endless name-dropping and a redacted record of Stein's salons. There is a section about Stein's childhoood that is worth reading, but it is much too short and much too dishonest. It would have been a sensational read in the 1930s, but today feels dated and irrelevant."
2,Name-Dropping Extravaganza,"Was looking forward to learning more about Paris and its denizens of the 20s and 30s but all Gertrude gives us is a bunch of names without much in the way of memorable stories involving the people associated with those names. Seems she was more interested in impressing everyone with who she knew than with helping her readers to know those people also. There is precious little here about Alice also. All in all, I found the book a let-down."
5,Language as liquid,"Gertrude Stein's playful and witty story of her life with Alice Toklas (told via the life story of Alice) chronicles nearly thirty years, up to 1932. Crackling with energy and zest, the story unfolds like conversation at a party where Picasso, Hemingway, Matisse, and others are in attendance, and the reader is introduced to them all in succession. Documenting not only their exciting life together, the book also takes us through the dangers of World War 1, as well as detailing Stein's writing activities. Ultimately, it is Gertrude Stein herself who shines throughout the book, through the lens of Toklas, and it is this portrait crisp and alive that makes this the most well-known of her works."
4,An interesting read,"This is the book that brought Stein into mainstream society, and not without reason. Considerably more accessible than her other work, she relays the story of her life through the personna of Alice B. Toklas, her life-long companion. Primarily consisting of remarks about the various movers of the Paris art and literary scene that took place at the turn of the century, Stein, above all, isn't afraid to say just what she thinks. However, her wry anecdotes and asides are not written without the greatest of attention to style, and the reader finds each sentence to be representative of the orignality in grammatical structure that made her famous."
3,The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas,"This is an odd little book but an enjoyable one. The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas was actually written by, and focuses on, Gertrude Stein. She presents herself as a rather enigmatic figure. She is the intimate friend of a number of first-rate artists and writers, and she maintains a legendary Paris salon. She identifies herself as a genius - actually, one of a group of three geniuses, the other two being Pablo Picasso and Alfred North Whitehead - but she doesn't feel compelled to justify the characterization. The narrative is essentially a chronology of a series of dinners, parties, and other outings with the names of the people who came. A very dry wit is occasionally seen, as when Picasso and cubist painter Georges Braque go to see an art dealer wearing their ""newest and roughest clothes."" The tone of the narrative is relaxed and friendly and it seems that Alice and Gertrude Stein had fun, if nothing else."
4,Wonderful,"Those looking for a straightforward narrative, go elsewhere but those looking for charming insights into the heart of the Parisian bohemian scene from roughly 1905-1933, this is the book. Stein's genius was to write the book as if one was actually having a conversation with her partner, Alice B. Toklas. Famous figures come in and out of the story: Matisse, Picasso, Braque, Fitzgerald, Hemingway. Not only is this a book about people but it's also a book about the heady days before World War 1 and the general unease and regrouping that was done after the war. You get plenty of insights about the art scene, and by the end of the book, find yourself wishing you could be sitting in Stein's salon, looking at all the paintings.This book can be read straight through from cover to cover or it can be read in bits and pieces and there is no lack of enjoyment from reaidng it either way."
2,Overrated Classic,"I picked up The Autobiography of Alice B Toklas after hearing about it for years. It is toted as a story about the relationship between two great influences in the Parisian world of arts and letters in the early 20th century. Instead I found a hagiography of Gertrude Stein written by Ms. Stein herself. According to her self-proclamations, she was a genius, a great writer, an auto mechanic, a great conversationalist, a supporter of the arts, etc., etc. The only one of these I feel competent to comment on is her skills as a writer. If this book is an example of her writing, then I am not convinced that she was a great writer.In its favor, The Autobiography does paint a picture, abstract but true, of the artistic world of Paris during the early 20th century. The most interesting chapter was the Was Years, where Alice and Gertrude Stein aided in support for soldiers during World War I.To me, this book is greatly overrated and not worth the time it takes to read it."
1,SPANISH EDITION,"I preordered this book, thinking it was a continuance of Little Altars and The Divine Secret of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. I did not see anything that told what this book was about. I got it this week and was sick when I saw it was in Spanish. I was waiting for another sequal to the others. I was so disappointed. It is on its way back. I would recommend that someone put in the description that this is the Spanish Edition. Certainly someone that reads Spanish would love it. It would save the seller money. I don't think I am the only one that returned it at the seller's expense."
1,"I must not understand, but Amazon came to my rescue!","I ordered this super cool looking phone cover for my AT&T; 8525 and when I got it I could not figure out how to make it fit my phone! The case was so cool looking but it was not made in a practical manner. I tried and tried to get it to fit my cool little phone, but to no avail.FRUSTRATION! I've ended up using my old Palm Lifedrive cover, and it works great. It's not a ""Slick"" looking cover, but has hard back and front covering, protecting my big screen on the front of the phone.The BIG news of the day is that I lucked out when I shopped Amazon. After I got all frustrated with the product and looked for the ""Send It Back"" policy, it was clearly stated and WELL followed thru. I received an easy to print return authorization, sent it back and got a refund right away to my PayPal account. Now THAT's service. I'm giving the product a 1Star, but I'd give Amazon a gazillion stars for their service!"
1,"Bad product, poor customer service","I would not recommend this product for several reasons. It sticks out quite a lot vs the more compact belt hugging type of cases I have used in the past.There is a plastic sheet that goes over the keyboard. When the phone is closed, you can see that the screen and keyboard are being forced apart on one side by the plastic sheet. This is a really poor design that can damage your expensive phone!Also, the pivot point is off-center, which means that it can only hang vertically, whereas I prefer it to hang horizontally.I sent the case back via USPS as per their instructions, and did not hear anything back. Now they are saying that they did not receive it. Will never buy from SF Planet again."
1,useless case for HTC Mogul,"I bought the case for the HTC Mogul, which is almost identical to the AT&T; 8525. But the case is inverted! The part with the camera needs to go on the bottom, and vice versa, and the phone buttons are covered by the case. Bottom line: this is quite a useless piece of equipment.Update: I gave it to a friend who owns an 8525, and it fits quite snugly. My friend is happy."
1,watkis,My review on this product this product is no good for the MDA it don't fit. i could'nt even use it.
5,Fantastic!!,Grabs you and doesn't let go till the very last page.. i couldn't put it down and my daughter just read it in two days.. i did it in one.. well worth buying..rose mary colarusso
4,Poor Editing,"First of all, let me recommend this as a great read. I would have given it 4.5 stars instead of 4, but it still is fast-paced and enthralling.I wish the editor had picked up Diehl's mistakes on the ages of Brodie Culhane and Ben Gorman at the beginning, having them go from 16 to 18 and back. And Hirshman's inexplicable metamorphosis into Morningdale in the last pages totally confused me.If not for sloppy correlation, the book would be a 10 (on my scale).CW"
2,DULL,"In the California town of Eureka, the shoot-'em up...of the Old West has survived well into the 20th century - until tough guy Brodie Culhane returns from WWI to clean it up. But Sheriff Culhane is no angel, either, and when a murder 20 years later brings Detective Zee Bannon sniffing around, the skeleton is Culhane's closet start rattling up a storm. A standard potboiler from Diehl (Sharky's Machine), an author who knows his way around them, Eureka's epic scope screams for a made-for-TNT adaption, but when aiming for grandiosity it stetches too thin. Not much gold in them thar pages, but if you'll settle for bronze you won't be disappointed."
3,3 1/2 Stars _Starts Off Strong But Just Okay Overall!,"I've been a big fan of all of William Diehl's books, and particularly Primal Fear. And, I thought Eureka was going to be right up there among his best after reading the first third or so of this noirish mystery. However, the remainder of the book's plot, while providing a lot of action, was somewhat predictable and unrealistic. Similarly, the main characters while likable, became too superhero-ish and the bad guys were ""cartoonish"" in terms of their development. So, all in all, although Eureka moves along at a fairly brisk pace and is not a bad book, it falls way short of fulfilling the high expectations I have for a book from William Diehl in general, and specifically because Eureka started out as a ""real winner."""
4,Mystery & History,"This book lets you see the history of a town and those who grew up in it. It gives you love, greed, hate, loss, murder, revenge and all that went into making a man who he became and his reasons for returning home...something he never planned to do, but couldn't stay away from."
3,Not What I expected,I liked the Martin Vail series of tight suspense with intense characters. Eureka was such a different type of story that it came as a surprise and did not hold my interest as intently as Diehl's earlier books did. The poor cop was a little too much a boy scout type and the love interest was so out of his league that it was distracting to the story as well as totally unrealistically written. I finished Eureka; it was an ok read for me but I am not looking to return to it as quickly as other readers seem to be wanting to do.
2,"No, this is not a 5 Star Machine","I do love the looks, best design there is in a home machine - and the Williams Sonoma people were great when I took it back a year later - pressure weak, thermostat not reading. Steam power lame (needs to re-charge itself half way through a milk-steaming). Not a really bad one, but functionality pales in comparison with looks. Now I'm looking at other machines."
2,Don't buy for the cool design,... ... get the Rancillio Silvia or Gaggia. This machine is known to be underpowered.
3,"Great Looks, bad looks correct, machine broke after two week","The FrancisFrancis! machine is gorgeous, however like many of the previous reviews stated, your paying for looks and not functionality. I recieved mine for Christmas of 2003 and within two weeks of using it water ran from the seal on the top of the machine, and the espresso was constantly burnt. I have had to send mine to be repaired, and they do send a box with all postage paid for. I wish I had taken the reviews into account more but it's just so awesome looking!!Just because this is an expensive machine, William and Sonoma and Sur la Table do have this item and when you have a problem with the machine you can take it back for a replacement, unlike Amazon.com where after 30 days you have to deal directly with the manufacturer. I think it's well worth paying a little bit extra to have this convenience!!!"
5,FrancisFrancis X1 Stainless Steel,"Great machine, have used many machines over the years. Very cool looks, heatup fast, makes unlimited amount of steam very quickly, makes multiple cups w/out waiting. I use ESE and love my perfecr shots every time. I am glad I bought this machine, it is less money and better quality than the previous 3 machines I have gone through.Buy this thing, don't listen to the weenies giving it a low rating!"
5,Perfecto!,"This machine is a working piece of art. Before investing in the FrancisFrancis!, I had never made made an espresso or cappuccino. I ordered a coffee book with the X-1 and made my first espresso within 10 minutes of receiving the machine. It was so easy and delicious. Yes, it is a heavy machine....incredibly well crafted. It is kind-of like driving a Toyota Landcruiser rather than a go cart! I like significant, heavy-duty appliances that stand up to regular use. You get what you pay for and this machine absolutely worth the price."
1,Best looking way to make a terrible cappuccino,"I'm Italian (born and raised there) and I grew up on cappuccinos. This is in absolute the most gorgeous way to make a terrible cappuccino. I have constant better result with the cheapest model made by Krupps.Pros:Beautiful to look atEspresso is goodCons:- It takes 15'-30' (minutes, not second!, and this is according to the manufacturer) to warm the machine up- The cappuccino is always watery- You need a stop watch to time exactly how much water you want in your espresso. You get distracted, and suddenly your espresso looks like any 'American' style coffee"
3,The revised version of this unit is greatly improved over the one which failed,"I had an original version of this unit for about a year. As an espresso machine, it is not nearly as good as a Faema Family, for example. After about a year, it ""smoked"" so badly that the room it was in now has a strong smoke odor. Fortunately, it only created a lot of smoke and no fire.Since this review was written, this ""guts"" of this unit have been completely redesigned to be much more reliable and ""fail-safe"", although the appearance remains almost identical. As a result, the above comments to not reflect the present production."
1,"Great Design, Awful Product","What an investment for such a dispointing product. I had an old ... Krups expresso maker that worked great for 5 years. The Francis model never had as much power. I sent it back in twice to get ""fixed"" (after much hassle from the company) and got my same machine back twice - with no noticeable improvements. Now the ""warranty period"" is over, and I have a ... machine that worked for about a month, caused me extreme hassle and headache, sitting on my kitchen cupboard because I don't know what to do with it. Buyer Beware."
2,Beauty is Only Skin Deep...,"I purchased this unit along with a friend and we were both very unsatisfied by the quality of coffee this beautiful machine produced. I'll keep this review short: it is not powerful, is fragile, and does not make a consistent cup of coffee (I know all of the tricks, I used to be a barrista in Milan). For the best machine under [this price], try the Rancilio Silvia 90. With the extra money you save, you can buy a matching Rancilio Rocky Grinder."
2,"Looks cool, but functions poorly","This machine is a ""design"" machine that will look fancy on your kitchen counter. However there are some major disappointments when you start using it. Most annoying is the tiny water-reservoir, which is in the back and can only be accessed by pulling the 16 lb machine out to the front of the counter to fill it up. The machines switches are not labeled, which can make for confusing/dangerous situations like turning on the steam while you are trying to brew your shot. Also anybody who doesn't use this machine on a daily basis won't be able to figure it out. It takes a long time to cool down after steaming, or you'lll have to run a good amount of water thru the machine to cool it down before brewing again, upon which you will discover that you just ran out of water again....We returned it."
1,"Looks great, but makes lousy espresso.","This is a really great looking machine that makes really poor espresso. I've seen people say that they are making espresso that is as good as what they are buying. That's great, but most of us in the coffee hobby and trade consider mass market espresso to be swill. A good home machine should be able to make a shot of espresso that is BETTER than you are buying at Starbucks or the like. This machine is underpowered and unable to pull a good shot. Go look for a Rancilio Silvia or Gaggia Classic instead."
5,"A riffin' good time, man...","I havn't listened to this in a while...when rap-metal was the exception rather than the rule, these guys were the masters of the underground. As I listen to this now, a smile crosses my face...these riffs are cutting bone, man! When you got Devin Townsend (SYL) on board, how could they not? Unfortunately, rap-metal grew to be yet another obstacle for real metal bands, which is ironic, cuz these guys were as metal as you could get. DISCLAIMER-These guys were in fact pro-wrestling loving steakheads from the South, but they made up for it through their sincerity-they believed in what they did, and it showed.A true original, and an f'n good time."
4,Much Better...,"I am a big fan; Mariah Stewart is an auto buy for me. I was worried though after the first couple books in the ""Truth"" series. They were not as good as I had come to expect. However, this one seems to be back on target for me. Although I was disappointed that the bad guy was so obvious. At least Regan's mystery was finally solved. That one was also obvious a few books ago.All in all, I highly recommend this author. But if you've never read her stuff, start with the set that has ""Dead"" in the title. Those are much better. Here's looking forward to her next set of books with ""Last"" in the title. I already have the first one and am getting ready to start it."
4,Shocking Finale,"Although it is not necessary to read the other three books in this series, if you have, Final Truth provides a very satisfying conclusion to the story of Regan Landry and Mitch Peyton. In this book, the story focusses on Regan and her quest to find out about her late father's (a famous true crime writer) fascination with Eddie Kroll. At the same time, Regan is trying to come up with an idea for a new book and becomes interested in the story of Lester-Ray Barnes, a convict on death row who may have been wrongly convicted after a major foul up with DNA evidence. A series of grisly murders and Regan and Mitch (an FBI agent) are on the trail of a killer...is it Lester-Ray? If you enjoy suspense, forensic science and well thought out character development, this book is for you!"
1,Ugh; incredibly annoying with an insultingly obvious storyline,"Ugh, this was seriously annoying; I spent 3/4 of the book frustrated and annoyed and calling the main characters idiots because it was so incredibly obvious what was going on and who the killer was. I would give this a half-star if I could; it was that bad. Definitely not a mystery nor suspenseful, as it's insultingly easy to predict what's going to happen, and not a romance either, since the relationship between the main characters is hardly explored. A thoroughly unfulfilling and annoying read; likeDark Truth: A Novel, certainly not worth buying and not even worth borrowing. BorrowCold Truth: A NovelandHard Truth: A Novelfor quick, interesting one-time reads if you have a lot of time on your hands, but definitely skipDark Truth: A NovelandFinal Truth: A Novel."
4,Final Truth,"If you like Mariah Stewart's writing, you will probably enjoy this book. However, I didn't think the mystery was particularly well done, I figured it out very early in the the book. Also, the ""shocking surprise"" about Eddie Kroll was broadcast at least 2 books ago. Read these for the characters and writing style, not the mystery."
4,Something very new and different,"I just got this cd and wow!! It is nothing like I expected it to be and I like it alot. I love ""There is no Arizona"" and ""Shiver"" alot. The whole cd is just alot different than anything out there right now and I hope Jamie O'neal stays that way. If you like country music with a little bit of color, then her cd is great for you!!"
5,I LOVE This!,Where has this singer been! She has an incredible voice and all of the songs on this album are wonderful! I highly reccommend this to both country and non-country fans!
5,The Beautiful Jamie O'Neal,"Jamie O'Neal has a refreashing, sultry, and beautiful voice. Mercury Records did a surperb job when they signed on this angelic voice to their label. I bought the CD for myself not long ago and my two daughters have practically taken it away from me! They as well as I just love the song, ""There Is No Arizona""! Another favorite of our's is the title song, ""Shiver"" and another is the beautifully written song, ""Where We Belong"". I do believe that Jamie O'Neal will be nominated for the ""Best New Artist"" and even possiblly ""Best Song""! Faith Hill, Martina McBride, and Shania Twaine.......move over cause Jamie's hot on your tails. Well done Jamie! It is high time for a fresh, new voice."
4,Comment to other reviews,"Hello all Jamie O'Neal fans. I love this CD as well as you all do but I would like to comment on the bashing of Faith Hill in a couple reviews. Faith is a very talented woman who just wants to entertain people. She never said she was strictly country and she is broadening her music span so I think you people should get over it and love her music like I do. I think it's extremely rude to say she basically has no talent. Don't get me wrong, I love Jamie O'Neal and the fact that she writes her own songs. But I think it's wrong to bash Faith like that. Thank you for listening. And by the way....I personally like Faith Hill a lot better than Jamie O'Neal."
3,"Uneven, but listenable","You see the video to ""There Is No Arizona,"" and you think you're on to an exciting new find. The song reminds you of other female country singers who seem willing to push the boundaries of the genre, particularly singers like sisters Allison Moorer and Shelby Lynne. Throwbacks, in a way, rebeling against all the country fluff out there. Unfortunately, the rest of the CD doesn't maintain that quality. Instead, it degenerates at times into crossover pop that disrupts any feel for consistency and leaves the listener wondering who is the real Jamie O'Neal. Overall, though, it's worth a listen, if nothing else to hear O'Neal's voice and to see the potential in her songwriting. Listeners can only hope that O'Neal abandons the pop stuff and sticks to the gutsy country."
5,Excellent music ! Great lyrics!,"Jamie's 1st CD is absolutely wonderful. I am very fond of this CD as many of the songs and their lyrics apply to me and happenings in my life at this time. My favorites are: Shiver, You Rescued Me, To Be With You and Sanctuary, but the entire CD is excellent. I recommend this anyone looking for some great country love songs!"
3,Too Many ballads,"Okay.I thought ""No Arizona"" Was not the coolest song but still okay.There are too many ballads. My favorite song though is ""Frantic"". I still think this is a great record but there are too many ballads."
3,Overshadowed collection,"The runaway success, and familiarity of ""There is No Arizona"" really launched Jamie O'Neal into the limelight, and the charts, but almost too much too soon. I purchased this album after seeing her perform live, and found it on the whole to be very enjoyable. My main criticism would be that unlike several of her peers, it seems a bit ""samey"" and one could be forgiven for listening to any given track (except the aforementioned Arizona) and saying ""Who was that?"". One can't help feeling that the majority of the album content is overshadowed by her debut single, and trys to compete, instead of embracing experimentation with each new addition. I am hopeful that there will be an improvement in the next offering, for a star who has shown so much promise, but looks destined to fall into obscurity otherwise."
3,A lot of potential here...,"""There is No Arizona"" is the freshest track to hit country radio in a long time. The song is very well written, stand-up-and-listen disturbing, and delivered with true conviction. But the remainder of the disc doesn't live up to the benchmark set by this one song. There's no denying this lady has presence and a great voice (shades of Martina McBride). If she can get a disc full of good songs next time around, she's a talent to be reckoned with."
2,Shiver one more schlok pop let down,"Jamie O'Neal can sing, true enough, but her material is just more of the same forgetable country-pop, and weak country-pop at that. The only song worth a second listen is ""There is No Arizona"". And maybe ""She Hasn't Heard it Yet"". The rest is a sad commentary on the state of country music today. Pick a path, Jamie, be brave! If the marginally talented Faith Hill can be a pop queen, then darn-it, so can you! Just don't use country music to get there - that's just slimey."
3,cd was great,I loved the cd. It was awesome; it only had one major draw back it could not be played on my computer. To me the regular cds are better than these enhanced versions.
4,Decent Country Album,I really liked most of the songs on this album. The duet with Mark Wills was great and so were most of the other songs. The first 2 were by far my favorite though.
5,Great CD,"This is the debut album for this up and coming country artist. However, with one listen you will understand the reason that this country beauty was invited to tour with the likes on reba and Martina McBride in the Girls night out tour. The cd shows this artists muscial range. This cd contains fast pased, fun songs like ""frantic"" all the way to love ballets like ""to be with you"".In short this cd is only beginning to a long and fruitful carrer for Jamie ONeal"
1,Not a good teacher,"There is very little teaching going on in this video. It is a guy telling you what he is going to do, and then he does it. Little detail, he assumes that you know all the chords in DADGAD. I gained no understanding of DADGAD-even though that is the claim for the video."
4,Great book for beginning-intermediate DBA's,"This is a very good to-the-point manual for all of the basic to intermediate subjects you need to know for Oracle 8i administration. I was surprised at how much was actually contained here relating to all of the different parts of the Oracle RDBMS world. However, it does not make a complete reference (no listing of init.ora parameters for example) and therefore garnered 4 stars from me instead of 5. It is a great book nontheless. Buy it!"
2,dissapointed,"This book is not for beginners. Difficult to read. You really need plenty of previous Oracle knowledge to be able to understand this book. If you're a newbie, I suggest you buy another book."
3,Moderately Helpful,"In my opinion the book is very hit and miss in what it covers. For example, there's a section on Database Space Management that covers how to add space - but it doesn't cover how to reclaim unused space using Truncate/Deallocate. I'd estimate that I find what I need about 50% of the time in this book - but that I have to go to another reference or to TechNet for the other 50%."
3,it is not clearly explained,"I bought the book and hope to understand the web related features of oracle8i. Unfortunately, the authors did not explain concepts well--it is pain to try even the simpliest task following their instruct, because they added many noise(not related information) in the instruction. This is a 1000 page book. First, you need much time to finish it. Second, even you read many pages, you didn't accomplish much, only some very basic stuff that are not explained well (I know someone like to make simple thing complicated). I have much better understanding from oracle online document (some are good). To be fair, it is better than 24 hour book."
1,missing 8i most important feature. This is not for 8i,"The author even has not figure out how to enter the enterprise manager. Look at the page 63 (also other pages): OracleOraOEMManagermentServer [blank] automatic. why automatic didn't start the OEM server? if not enter the OEM, how to logon on to OEM and manager oracle8i from different machines?(...)"
4,Beautifully rendered take on Shaw's Pygmalion,"When I first opened the book, I was caught into the lyricism and straight-forwardness. It's a fascinating story of a well-known and highly in demand courtesan who aims to seduce a sculptor. The sculptor falls for her and aims to please her, but once she is his, she falls into the shadow of his beloved statue. The story of sumptious, and I finished it in two days. It isn't for everyone, but for anyone interested, it is an excellent read."
2,eminently forgettable soundtarck,"There are thousands of soundtracks out there and most of them are average. This is average and nowhere near up to Randy's usual. He is one of the greatest modern soundtrack composers in my opinion. Just listen to Avalon, Awakenings, the Natural, Bugs Life and Pleasantville."
2,Oh and OK,"2 1/2Struggling against the current of indie pop-rock boredom, these earnestly conceived but forgetfully derivative anthems only excel at streamlining already posited modern hipster styles."
1,These guys are sooo wacky!,"Mother of God. I was listening to online radio at work and then something by these guys came on. I actually stopped listening and started working for a while--data entry being all the more stimulating. In all seriousness, it would much easier to stomach an entire Mariah Carey Christmas album in one sitting then attempt to choke down a single track by these artless hacks. Go back to college. Do something. Anything besides making records."
4,Spinto-lucious,"i saw these guys open for Head of Femur in Aug 2005 and bought the disc at the show.A solid pop effort that rocks.Nick Krill is the new David Byrne.This band rocks with ska punk frenzy. See them live if you ever get the chance. Thomas Hughes' dancing while playing is infectious. The Hobson brothers are so low key but incredibly talented.Did I Tell You is a wonderful opening song.Brown Boxes (with its frequently reviewed kazoo riff) is probably my favorote song (although Sears took a liking to Oh Mandy and had it in one of their commericals for a while... if you ever get a chance to watch the video, it's very fun).This band has all the right music sensibilities.I look forward to their next disc and US Tour."
4,i like,"just saw them open for the arctic monkeys at the henry fonda in hollywood lasst night and although the mics were skrewed up and i couldnt tell what they were saying half the time i still knew i wanted the album. i just got it and i love it. its different from other stuff out now and who doesn't love a bunch of guys who will no only play the kazoo in concert, but will also give them out for free after."
4,Loving Spinto,The other reviews are saying what I'm thinking...but one word comes to my mind:Infectious.So glad I took a blogger's word for it and ordered via Amazon. Just got it yesterday and completely addicted. I hope they make it out to the West coast!
1,Krups Coffeemaker,I gave this coffeemaker as a Christmas gift and the coffeemaker leaks. I would like to return it. A coffeemaker that cost $300.00 shouldnt leak. Please provide the instructions for returning.Thank YouKen Berg
2,Coffee in the morning,"I ordered this coffee maker as my husband has only decaf and I have regular. This was the perfect idea instead of have two separate coffee makers sitting on my counter. I liked the design, as it was not bulky. The coffee stayed hot in the insulated pots. It made great coffee. The only major problem was the the water leaked out from the top water reservoir, where the water drained into the pots. It had a selection between the on/off switches for making four cups or less. The switch could not be turn off. The left side is the side that this feature operated on, had the most water leaking out. There was probably about a half of cup of water each morning on my counter. The coffee maker cost too much money to have this problem. I returned the coffee pot within three days of making coffee."
2,lukewarm coffee,"I wish I had read the review of the duothek before I purchased it. No matter what you do , rinse with hot water before brewing the coffee comes out to be very disappointing. If you add milk forget it , you might as well make iced coffee!"
2,unhappy coffee drinker,"My husband and I received this coffeemaker as a gift for Christmas. My husband wanted the dual caraffe that it touts. However, our previous coffeemaker had a timer and a one minute ""sneak a cup"" feature. I believe this machine is slower than what we had prior. I also have a problem with the temperature of the coffee. To boast that you blend a better cup of coffee doesn't matter if I end up putting my cup of cold coffee in the microwave to heat it up! I'm very dissatisfied with this machine. I expected more from KRUPS and can't believe the price. It is not worth it."
3,"Makes good coffee, but missing key features","We replaced a single Krups stainless coffee maker with a new duotek stainless. We like the way it looks. Makes good coffee. Krups makes good, long lasting products. Only knock on this one is no digital display and no preset coffee timer (had both of these features on last one). Krups should rethink pricing strategy. This should be 179 with key features I mentioned. Consider returning it for Delonghi which has those features for 179."
1,Overpriced/Inferior,"This product is certainly not worth the money I paid for it. I am so sorry I never read the reviews. It does not keep the coffee warm, it has not brewing timer, nor does it have a shut-off timeer. For this price, it should have all of this but the worst of it is it does not keep the coffee warm."
1,Piece of junk :-(,"We purchased this thinking it would be a great coffee maker and it is junk. The hoppers that hold the coffee don't pivot out from the maker they sit on top of the carafes. When you are making your coffee in the morning you have the two carafes, two hoppers, two bags of coffee and the grinder out at the same time. When the coffee is brewed you remove the carafe and hopper together and try to pour a cup of coffee holding the dripping hopper in one hand over the cup and pour out of the carafe at the same time. The hoppers don't have a drip stop feature. The carafes are open and have separate lids. I've had inexpensive makers that had drip stop, integral carafe lid and pivoting hoppers. I have not had the cold coffee problems other report. I was very disappointed in this piece of crap from France."
1,HELP,"I used this coffee make and only one side worked. I did what the instructions asked and the right side will not make coffee. I have returned it to Zaccardi's but they said it was over 30 days and to return it to Krups, it was a gift so I couldn't really help it. Now I have to wait for them to return it to me. I just want a coffee maker that works. We have a regular coffee drinker and a de-caf drinker, I was so excited to find this gem."
1,broken on arrival and cannot return due to Amazon,do not purchase this through Amazon as it arrived broken and we have been unable to get the seller to exchange it.
2,Not satisfied at all,"When a person pays this much money for a coffee maker it should at least make hot coffee. Unforturnately the coffee when freshly brewed is not hot but a little past warm. I do not believe that the carafes, double walled with a vaccuum, work that well either in keeping the tepid coffee tepid. As far as the warmers go they do not keep the coffee warm like my old unit does. Possibly the double walled carafes are impacting the way these keep the coffee warm. I would not purchase again."
2,"Good, but I don't get the praise","I had heard so many good things about this band that I bought two of their albums (this one and ""Mandylion""). Well, the accolades given to this band are unjustified.Anneke's voice is WAY over the top. One reviewer stated that ""she sounds like she's singing showtunes,"" and that's an accurate assessment. Her vibrato is exaggerated, although she does have a unique style that works with some of the tracks.But there's no variation is song-tempo, which ultimately makes for a dull listen. If you're partial towards hard rock/metal with a female vocalist, you can do better than this (i.e., Nightwish, Lacuna Coil, Evanescence...Amy Lee's vocals are unmatched, I'm sorry).Either this album blows you away or it doesn't, and I belong with the latter category."
4,Great melodic songs,"After Mandylon, the dutch band The Gathering still improves their special sound. This CD has a lot more melody as compared to Mandylon but still captures the unique sound. On the foreground of every song is the great voice of Anneke. On the background is the drowning sound of guitars, keyboards and drums, making the singing more beautiful. This music definetely is depends on your mood, it is kind of emotional."
4,"Good, but not AMAZING.","Ok so when I first listened to this cd, I though ""Is this a dream"" as I thought when I heard Mandylion and How to Measure a Planet. Lovely music, lovely vocals, lovely lyrics(though lacking a certain, profoundness) But soon enough, you get a bit wearsome of these noises of her voice, her pronounciation, and the way she tends to whine..it just ends up putting you off, some very good tracks particularely the last one, I love the whole deep sound of a grand piano. Definately a good buy, but it has to be the first one you buy because otherwise you'll get dissapointed that it is not as good as Mandylion."
4,Nice album,"Nice CD. It's like your making a yourney through a fairy-tale world. Especially the last three songs (Kevin's Telescope, Nighttime Birds and Shrink) are great. Anneke's voice perfectly fits into the music."
3,Finally... some intelligence.,"This movie isn't for the intellectually or emotionally vacuous, or for anyone who finally wanted a chance to see Paul Provenza naked (which I did). Well written, expertly directed, and perfectly cast, this one gets your rocks off mentally - which can often be more satisfying than physically, and a refreshing change from the run-of-the-mill sex flicks. Dan Butler, an excellent though underrated actor, is wonderfully intense and a perfect choice to star in this movie. He comes off as smart, intuitive, glib and even sensual - i.e., sexy as hell. Finally I found a DVD I won't throw in the trash after one viewing..."
5,Movie - Fixing Frank,I thought I had already reviewed this product.I hate when the site updates there sites and can't keep the ratings and notes on the items.
4,Fear of fixing,"If the topic of reparative therapy is of interest to you, this movie offers an inside view to the methods of ""questioning self"" no matter what your preference. If you seek entertainment skip Fixing Frank. The film requires your full attention from the start and boldly challenges ethics of the psychology profession as well as the gay agenda. Who wins at the end of this theatrical chess game? Depending upon the circle of friends you keep the answer is worth exploring especially if some friends are afraid to speak."
4,Ben 10,"Purchased this DVD for my grandson who seems to be into the Ben 10 sagas. He enjoys watching them and tends to favor these over other fantasy videos. Would recommend to others, only if they are not opposed to high action and alien themes."
4,Ben 10 Ultimate Alien 1,i used to watch this cartoon on tv . it was good. i am happy i got this dvd.this was a good buy
5,Ben 10 review,The DVD was received very quickly and in excellent condition. My son enjoys this series and I am sure he will enjoy this video very much.
4,DaliFlor,This is a light very floral fragrance that has the remarkable ability to brighten any mood. DaliFlor is spring. DaliFlor is open. DaliFlor is feminine.
3,It's Okay,"Product does what its supposed to do, but lack of direction in setting up your basics makes it harder then it needs to be to get started with your schedules."
5,Who'll Stop the Rain,"This is a terrific movie. I watch it every couple of years or so and find something new in it each time. Nolte, Weld, and Moriarity are wonderful. The story is a relentless exploration of how the war in Viet Nam affected us. One of the best movies I have ever seen."
4,Warning Spoiler - READ ONLY at your discretion...,"I don't know - do we need a spoiler warning for a film from the 70's at this point? Anyway, this film was a footnote caught somewhere between Apocalypse Now and Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, etc.. But I liked it in the same way as Billy Jack in that it was an unpretentious story driven off pure character and story. No wiz bang special effects (except maybe the finale) here just people caught up in circumstance. But the ending sticks with me to this day. Nolte double-times it off into the distance, at port arms, improbably singing a Jody call (a real old school non-PC one at that). You can't predict nor control and perhaps even understand what life and fate throws at you but to be true to your own nature in spite of it is about as best as anyone can expect."
4,Wins on atmosphere,"Drenched in 70s atmosphere, it's a decent flick. The acting and storyline are not bad either. Just wish it had had English subtitles as volume vascilates a lot and subtitles would have helped me follow the dialogue a little easier. It's a pretty tough movie that captures something of a lost era, but better to go in expecting less and coming out with more than vice versa. Another good thing about the DVD is that it comes in a solid standard case and not one of these crappy new ""environmentally friendly"" DVD cases that have half the plastic cut out of them and which allow the insert artwork to become shelf worn a lot earlier than otherwise. If you're gonna invest in a DVD, you're obviously not planning to recycle the case. There are no special features besides a trailer."
1,"Good book, terrible movie","I had recently read Robert Stone's book ""Dog Soldiers"" and thought it was very good. I had heard that this movie was a forgotten minor classic and since I like both the book and Nick Nolte, I thought, ""How bad can it be."" Well, I hated it! Key events from the book were cast in a different light that completely changed the whole point of the story. The acting was for the most part weak, though Nick Nolte did wring as much as he possible could from the script. Michael Moriarty's character was weakly portrayed, and, again, in the book he is a much weaker and less sympathetic person, though his character is much more fleshed out. All the strengths of the book (strong characterization, flashes of humour among other things) are missing. Skip this and read the book instead"
1,On my list of the ten worst films of all time,"The first mistake the filmmakers made was changing the title of this film from Robert Stone's great novel ""Dog Soldiers"" to ""Who'll Stop the Rain."" A wimpy title attemping, and ultimately failing, at cashing in at the box office with a CCR tune, and not a particularly good one at that. Their second mistake was casting the lead with the most dull and unconvincing actor in Hollywood: Nick Nolte. Uninspired direction from Karel Reisz (who?) only adds to the insult. In the hands of a Scorsese or a Kubrick this could have been a great film. Alas, its a muddle and doesn't even get much air time on late-night TV. But then again, why sould it?"
3,decent little bar,"I've been looking to replace a nine inch bar that I've had for years, but can't find it anywhere. This was the closest but is smaller than ideal for my needs"
5,Not a bad thing to have in the tool box!,"I bought this pry bar a few years ago. It went untouched for a very long time! That all changed when our new refrigerator got delivered. I measured twice and ordered once (I should have measured three times, but I'm happy I didn't!) In under 2 minutes, I was working with the wonderbar and my hammer. The molding came loose from the wall, the refrigerator slid into place and the day ended well! You might not use this pry bar every day, but the one time you need it, you will be glad you did! Buy it!"
1,useless,"Its hard for me to imagine what the people that rate this highly use it for. Perhaps they are confusing this with the original Wonder Bar, which is a very useful toolI agree with what Mr. Pearson said, its too thick for anything small and delicate (like trim) and too small to be of any use for anything large. I'm not familiar with the bars he recommends but instead of this piece of junk I suggest the Red Devil 4050 Scrape 'N Pry Bar. Thats a constant in my tool bag"
3,Primarily for primary teachers,"I was impressed with the customer reviews, so I ordered Snapshots. It is filled with lots of good minilessons, but I teach 7th and 8th grade reading improvement classes, and there wasn't much in it that I could use with my students."
5,A great modern thrash album,"This album is very impressive and only continues to get better with each listen. There are riffs aplenty, remaining heavy throughout, yet manage to be catchy to the point where you can't get them out of your head. The dual vocal style is a kind of Dave Mustaine/death metal hybrid and varies nicely from song to song. The best songs IMO are the opening track ""Time Dealer"", ""Mind Split"", and ""Black Side"", but there are no weak tracks on this album. If you're looking for a modern day thrash masterpiece, pick up this album, Lyzanxia does not disappoint."
1,Grill top very bad quality,"Being Swiss, I know how what normal wear and tear is on a racelette oven. The oven itself is great, and the little pans are made of good non stick material. The top grill however is of very very poor quality. The coating was starting to chip, in addition to bubbles forming on the surface just after a couple of uses. I do NOT recommend this grill if you want to be grilling on top."
3,"Great concept, not so good execution","Was thrilled to discover Raclette cooking last new year. Purchased this in April 2006 but just used it for the first time this past weekend. I agree with previous reviewers that the clearance between the little slide-in trays and the heating element is quite poor. Pile the food too high, even just a small to moderate amount is too high, and it starts to immediately smoke and burn. The top grilling surface is hard to clean, be sure to have a little non-stick cooking spray or olive oil on hand ahead of time to help. After one use the grilling surface already looks a year old with the amount of stains it has.I was also surprised that at full power, the 'broiling' effect on the cooking of the food in the slide-in trays wasn't that strong and that food took a long time to cook. Haven't noticed any frailty in the food trays, but I will definitely be taking it easy with the grilling top surface.Kind of disappointed. For the money it should have been better all around."
3,Raclette,"We tried Raclette several times in Germany and loved it so we came back and bought this one for ourselves. This one does not have very much clearance between the little food tray and the heating element so the food has to be very level or get scorched. Also, the cleanup is very difficult. I tried soaking the top in water with dishwashing soap and it actually ate the teflon away in some of the areas. We still love Raclette and we will use this simply because we paid too much not to but I would have been happier paying around $25 for this set."
1,never did get the calendar and never did order it,"I do hope I am not being charged for things I never ordered or received, but am asked to do a review on them?"
3,Not what I expected,"I listened to, and loved, their single ""Flavor of the Weak"". But, their songs are so diverse, the only way way can tell they're by the same group is by the talented artists. This cd is nothing at all like I expected, but is a great cd. It sounds like a few different popular punk band mixed together for one energetic cd."
4,Its great to hear more punk/alt rock,"I get so sick of hearing pop bands so when Hi-Fi, Blink, and NFG come on, I... Hi-Fi is an awesome band. ""Flavor of the Weak"" is real good and I like how punk/alt bands are getting more recognition and radio play. Some of Hi-Fi's songs are just same tune, different words, but nobody cares."
3,Rock n' roll cotton candy,"American Hi-Fi is a good rock CD to listen to. These guys are good musicians and the songs have good melodies and guitar riffs. There's nothing to complain about with any of the songs while you're listening. The only problem I have every time is that when I'm finished listening to it, I can't remember any of the songs. They just don't stick with you in any memorable way. Once the CD is over, it all fades away. This CD is like rock n' roll cotton candy; it's a nice treat while it lasts, but it dissolves fast."
3,"kids, have fun with this one","thats basically how i feel about this cd.pop it in on a sunny day and let the catchy tones and fun lyrics take over.we have all heard ""flavor of the weak""-not too bad,not strong at all though.""surround"" is a very good cut,my personal favorite.""hi fi killer"" is really good and ""another perfect day"" is fantastic and mellow.a great relationship song for that special someone.its pretty basic stuff,nothing too special but not horrible nonetheless.i always break it out every now and then just to have a good time.thats my take.for fans of oleander,magna fi,bowling for soup,and butch walker."
3,Okay,"This cd ranges from lightweight punk in the name of Blink 182 to electro metal like Nine Inch Nails. The songwriting is better than most of the nu metal sh*t out there today, but, there are a few lacking points. ""Hi Fi Killer"" is a BLATANT Nirvana rip-off that sounds so much like ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" it sounds like a cover band. This imitation is worse than Bush's ""Little Things"". Next is the Nine Inch Nails imitation ""My Own Enemy"". Other than the derivatives, this cd is worth buying if you like punk-pop."
4,This is not Punk Rock,"Don't believe all the reviews. This is not punk rock. If you want punk go pick up a Lagwagon CD or NOFX. This is pure radio-alternative rock. Similar to SR-71. The CD is well produced and the music blends well together, but personally I was expecting a harder-edged band. This is not the case. Put this CD in you car-disc changer and go for a drive. That's what this CD reminds me of. Good, clean, summer driving music. A good CD to pick up, but not if you're expecting punk rock."
3,"dude, dont you remember that flavor of the weak song? ..no","American Hi Fi is an interesting band. I got this CD back right when it came out in 2001 and was pretty hooked on it. So, maybe i like it now just because i liked it then and cant see through the only so-so lyrics, the stolen guitar riffs, and the attempt to sound like a hard rock band...but i really like this disc. I guess i wouldnt really recommend this CD to people who really are looking for something innovating, but its just a good CD to listen to if you want to relive back when pop music was decent (even though if you really want good pop music..Sister Hazel and Counting Crows are the way to go)."
4,too cool cd,"this cd is great. I knew this cd was awsome from the time i heard ""FLAVOR OF THE WEAK"" on the radio i knew i had to get this album. all of the songs are great. get out and buy this cd."
3,Good but you've heard it before......,"I just finished listening to this, and I will tell you exactly who these guys sound like. No, not Blink. No, not Nirvana. Maybe a little Lit. My friends, they sound exactly like OASIS!!! Put on ""Whats the Story Morning Glory"" right after this, and you will swear it's the same album!! Tell me this guy isn't ripping off Lliam Gallagher's vocal style!! Catchy power pop, done better years ago by Cheap Trick. Not bad, not ""Nevermind"" status....you get the idea."
5,"This song just rocks and it says something, too.","This song just rocks. I love it when a song has not only a great beat but says something about life. And, this one does it: it reminds me of some female friends I have who have wasted their time with boyfriends who could care less about them . .. years later, they realize their mistake but then its been several years that were wasted. Yeah, I know, she makes me weep . .. sort of sad in a way . .. but that's why the song resonates for me. Regardless of the message, it just rocks!!!"
1,Yuck,"Horrible, waste of money piece of garbage. This guy Stacy couldn't sing if his life depended on it - he USED to be a decent drummer. ... Sounds like a bunch of twelve year old trying to sing a catchy song. It is obvious that this CD was created to make money and make money only - because no real musician would make something like this. Keep trying American Hi Fi - and look on the bright side - you couldn't possibly get any worse!!"
3,its ok,"hey this cd is alright its not the best they dont have a ton of good songs but i love flavor of the week and hi-fi killer. anything is better than pop, so on with rock and punk"
5,Great intro into OOP,"Excellent, language neutral book for burgeoning OO programmer. You will not learn how to program, but how to design your classes."
2,don't buy this book if you are a professional OO-Developer,"Probably I should have paid more attention at the word ""fundamentals"" in the title, before buying this book.The book contains a pretty basic and superficial overview of UML (Part 2), stuffed in the middle of an introduction to OOD/OOP (Part 1), and a description of good OOP principles (Part 3).Skipping preambles, jokes, and trivial examples, the juicy information about UML can be read through in a couple of hours.If you are familiar with OOP and you just need a professional tutorial on the UML formalism, you'd better look fo another book."
2,Not a complete OO or UML fundamentals book,"The author uses his own dialect of UML in too many places, Skips Use-Cases all together. The examples are too simplified. It is not fundamental OO because he doesn't define OO terminology as it is in the standards. He gives his oppinion on everything and this colors his explanations and examples.If you are looking for a beginners UML or OO forget about this book. If you like to read another angle on some parts of the OO or some UML diagrams then this is your book."
5,"Good Beginning for Object Oriented Design ""Virgins""",I borrowed this book from a co-worker a couple of weeks ago and I could not put it down. Mr. Page-Jones breaks down the concepts very plainly and succintly with excellent examples.All the sections were clear and it provides very helpful hints on designing good applications with some real world examples. I really enjoyed his sense of humor and candor throughout the book.An educational and entertaining book. A must for newbie's to object oriented design
4,UML as a useful accessory to OO design,"Maybe, just maybe, Page-Jones might update this book to account for the release of UML 2. But then again, this book is still very pertinent, regardless of which version of UML you are currently on. The descriptions here let you describe many types of object oriented software packages, in a useful and concise manner. One that can be readily understood by others who have not worked on coding the packages. Plus, of course, another great advantage of being able to use UML is during the planning and coding of those packages.While you can certainly do OO design without UML, Page-Jones suggests why UML can aid in the understanding."
4,Passage at Arms,"It's probably important to know that this isn't the kind of book where there are huge battles in space, with ships blasting away at each other.Instead, it's a book about tension, about waiting. Actions which may prove meaningless -- and sometimes do. Events incomprehensible even to participants. As such, Passage at Arms is a notably well-written book, but it's not an easy read. There's no break for the characters, and none for the reader either. There's no comic relief whatsoever. You're trapped in a tiny, hot ship with its crew and the narrator, a war correspondent. In first person present tense, the story seems to represent the correspondent's real, uncensored report.Lessening the impact of this book were some loose ends (a blackmail subplot that never goes anywhere, which might be deliberate nihilism) and characterization which could have been deeper, especially of the narrator. Still, this is a good one."
4,Submarine military sci-fi,"Passage at Arms is a submarine warfare story thinly disguised as sci-fi, and tying in with Cook's Starfisher's trilogy. Rather than submarines, we have climber ships, humanity's edge in a war with strange aliens.The principles - such as they are - are different, but the result the same: ships that can hide out of space (under the sea) and strike with surprise, but always fragile and liable to be lost without trace.Its a cross between Run Silent Run Deep, The Hunt for Red October, and space opera. Its a minor classic in the sci-fi field, or should be. Its military sci-fi before that was popular, and like so much of Glen Cook's stuff, he quietly broke ground in which new genres could flourish."
2,What were the other reviewers thinking?,"I really found nothing compelling about this book at all. I won't be the one to elaborate on all it's faults, or rather lack of virtues, but I feel obligated to at least add a ding to it's appallingly high review score."
4,Really is Das Boot,"Like several other reviewers, I will say this is Das Boot in space. I knew that before I started reading, but I was still surprised at how close it comes. The basic plot is very much the same until right at the end. Despite being an ""old"" book by scifi standards it doesn't feel dated. One thing you might find interesting is the enemy aliens are much more likely to follow the ""rules"" of war as far as taking prisoners and helping survivors than the humans are."
4,A Passage at Arms,"Well written story loosly based on the Starfisher series by Glenn Cook. Packed with action, I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to other works by this author."
5,Core Weight Resistance Routine,"This is my core (& has been for many years) resistance or weight lifting routine. It is easy to follow, you can mix it up the way you want by using different weights for different exercises, after a while, you can cut the sound down on the tape, and play music or listen to talk radio while you work out. This tape and its routine will give you the best results in the quickest of time if you do it AFTER you do one of her fat burning aerobic tapes. Three times a week or every other day, add this in after your cardio, fat burning, or aerobic exercises have been done. If you want long skinny arms stick to 2 pound weights, if you want more muscle tone, go 3 pounds or higher. You can also add weight while you do her aerobic exercises on her aerobic tapes."
3,"I expected more from ""Stop the Insanity"" lady!","I remember her from the 90's as the ""Stop the Insanity!"" lady. I thought her workout would be interesting. Well - not really. She does all exercises exactly the same - 3 sets of 10 in 2 counts. Every exercise is done like that. And she talks non stop, which is ok but she says the same things over and over and over. She does upper body and legs but not one ab exercise. I was disappointed and I won't be keeping this one. But it might be good for someone just starting out?!?"
1,Disappointing,"I loved Patricia's first book, The Ripening Sun. It was fresh, interesting, engaging. So I could not wait to get this one. What a disappointment! Page after page of adjectives and adverbs describing hunting trips, truffling (briefly) and so on. I have spent some time in that area of France, and I was unaware of how many things are""succulent.""Patricia has a compelling story, but it is absent from this book. Her first book was a real winner because it had a lot going on -- from novice to expert, from married to adrift, from stranger to neighbor. This one is static, and just plain boring. I hope Patricia will keep writing, but next time we need some sort of narrative to hang all the descriptions on."
2,Very disappointing after her first book!,"This book was very slow and disappointing after the ""Ripening Sun"", which I really enjoyed and couldnt put down. This one is disjointed and dull, and I dont think I have even finished it...."
2,Decent album destroyed by poor sound,"The other reviewers have not sufficiently emphasized just how bad this album sounds! It is easily the tinniest, most sub-bootleg recording I've ever heard! It sounds like it's being blasted at full volume out of Walkman headphone speakers. Which is a shame, as the music itself is fairly well-structured black metal, with solid riffs and dynamics that work to the advantage of the songs rather than just to the need of the musicians to appear technically adept. It's just too bad that the minuses of the awful sound override the pluses of the music, and thus will confine this disc to the back of my collection."
2,Ulver's worst album.,"Century Media gave a s**tload of money for the recording of NATTENS MADRIGAL - in plain english, THE MADRIGAL OF THE NIGHT. The band, who felt were being ""bought"", got their hands on a 4-track & (supposedly) recorded the whole album in the woods. CM at the time was cashing in Black Metal's huge (underground-wise) success in Europe. Ulver was one of the last being picked up by a major underground label; the last being CRADLE OF FILTH & DIMMU BORGIR. This record is a step back from Ulver's brilliant debut, BERGTATT."
3,BLEEAAAAAARRRGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Yep. That's about what Ulver's third album constitutes to. As you may already know, production here is so bad that it sounds like a screeching buzzsaw. Maybe after listening on several separate stereos and players, I can find one that can alter noise and uncover the drums over the constant buzzsaw guitar. Maybe then the cd can grow on me. The weird spook ambient tracks between songs add more character to this mess of noize. Now don't get me wrong. I love earsplitting noise. I have Merzbow's Venereology and I love it. But however, this is just bad production and so far (from what I know) only Halo can make that an art form. Now some people may enjoy this recording style, but if you are not the type for it, try this album at your own risk."
1,A complete sham.,"This release was designed to cash in on the ""raw"" and ""underground"" black metal sound. Someone took a decent digital distortion rig and pretended to make an album in a forest, claiming all of the cliche of the genre with none of its honesty. The music itself is warmed over rock music which, once you get past how good the production sounds even when trying to sound distorted and garbled, is completely lukewarm and useless to any red-blooded black metal aficionado. Avoid! Burn!"
4,beautiful shriek of an album,"it feels like this album is ulver's shot at marduk, gorgoroth, and all the bands who play incredibly fast, raw, unproduced black metal. they create an incredibly fast, vicious, nasty album, and at times the ear-scraping production can get to you. but don't give up, because this album is one of the very best in this style - the whole way comes ulver's incredible sense of melody etc. v. good"
3,How to howl,"Although this could definitely stand to gain some low end, buried underneath the piercing mix is a seething, if repetitious vitality."
2,Captain Britain in the House of M,"One of the most effected books from Brian Michael Bendis' House of M was the various X-Men books, but you wouldn't tell by reading this tie-in. House of M: Uncanny X-Men follows the saga of Captain Britain as he finds himself trapped in the alternate reality world where mutants are the dominant species. There's a side story as well involving Marvel Girl and Psylocke, but the total effect of the TPB is just plain boring. Since legendary X-Men scribe Chris Claremont made his return to the X-books, there have been a number of ups and downs, and while this isn't his lowest point (X-Treme X-Men anyone?), he has certainly done much better than anything to be found here. In all actuality though, this is actually more of a setup for Claremont's New Excalibur series than anything else really. Alan Davis' artwork is always worth the price of admission though, so this isn't a complete loss. All in all, this is one House of M tie-in that's better left on the shelf."
4,Where are the Issues #466-471?,"Anyone can tell me which graphic novel that has Uncanny Xmen #466-471? (the New Age Series) There is a new graphic novel of Volume 5, but it begins at issue #472. I have been trying to find it. Help me? Thanks."
3,"Looks great, works fair","We've been using the Francis X5 for six months with mostly good results. The styling and color choices seem to be the maker's priority. The instruction manual was nearly worthless; just a few pictures and symbols and no information about set up, troubleshooting, etc. It took us about 30 minutes to figure out what the (unmarked) switches and buttons were for. My complaint now is that the steam nozzle is very loose and is losing steam pressure where it connects to the boiler. After a close examination of the metal structure, it appears to be mostly riveted or welded together. I can find no way to open up the case and tighten the nozzle. The machine still makes fine espresso but steaming milk has become a problem. For the price, I would expect better documentation and reliabilty."
3,the good and the bad,"If you liked ""Dreaming Neon Black"" or ""Dead Heart in a Dead World"", you may find this album to be a bit of a surprise. The guitar work isn't quite as skillfully written and melodic as on later albums; instead they are mostly grinding and churning and noisy. This works sometimes, but not all the time. The lyrics are overall much weaker, and Dane doesn't seem to sing them with the same depth he developed later. The self-titled ""Nevermore"", which is more like this album stylistically but is much better crafted, inexplicably predates this one, making ""Politics"" a bit of a black sheep. Still, there are some very strong individual tracks on this album, such that I would recommend it to Nevermore fans but would not recommend starting with it. My favourites are the amazing ""The Learning"", ""Precognition"", ""Passenger"", ""Tianamen man"", and much of ""The Politics of Ecstasy"". As you can see this is half of the album, so I give it a ""halfway"" rating."
1,Reading Specialist Test,"This book claims to offer test questions for the Praxis/CST Reading Specialist test, however the questions were nothing like the actual test. In addition, the book does not offer explanations for answers."
1,Not worth the money!!!,"You might be tempted to buy this since there is so little out there to prepare anyone for this test--PRAXIS II 0300, but this isn't the book. The cover looks wonderful, but inside it seems to be the typed notes (literally from a selectric typewriter circa the 80's) from someone who has taken classes in diagnosing reading disabilities. It will not be helpful in preparing for the PRAXIS exam. You will even find typographical errors! I do not recommend this book."
4,Nice R&B track,"Tight beat, tight lyrics, tight song overall. Check it out if you haven't heard it yet!"
5,mmmmh where this guy been hiding,when i heard this cut i knew it was going to be a hit with me he had's a sound i have not heard in a long time... nice slow jam hopefuly jaheim put out a cd soon he not only sounds sexy he is sexy.....
4,"Early 60's schlock, fun and silly","The Spotlight Review by ""cookieman"" covered it all. A good review of a not that good film. Indeed, ""House of the Damned"" stole from ""House on Haunted Hill"", ""The Old Dark House"", ""Freaks"", and a few others. What I'm compelled to add, is that, next to Beverly Garland and Gloria Talbott, Merry Anders is just about the best B-movie actress of that era. I always enjoy seeing her. I guess she was locked into a contract at 20th/Fox, and never recovered. Too bad. She had a lot of class and sass and moxy. I remember stuff like that.The DVD transfer is very fine. The ending is a let-down; too bad it's blabbed away in the trailer and liner notes (as Mr. Cookieman said...) Some spooky moments, and typical of the 60's fare. Don't expect anything to make you jump out of your chair."
1,Pure Garbage,"This movie was about as bad as things could get. Worse than that, this is really a straight rip off of the original ""House of the Damned"" that was directed by Sean Weathers, an independent film maker from New York City. He shot the original ""House of the Damned"" in 2002, with a zero budget and made a movie that is far superior to this piece of hot garbage. At the time the orginal ""House of the Damned"" was relegated to word of mouth being that Sean Weathers didn't have a distribution deal, but after forming his own production company Full Circle Filmworks, the original House of the Damned is for sale on Amazon as well and I can attest that the difference between this piece of crap and the Sean Weathers movie is night and day. Check it out for yourself!"
1,"Hey, Yale Students...","...when you all wonder why the people who live in New Haven (we're ""townies"" to you) year round are happy when summer rolls around and you all go home to puke on your own lawns and stagger stupidly through your own streets, I invite you to read this book. I assume it'll answer any questions you might have on the subject."
1,very poor & bratty as well,"what a badly written book. it's so annoying to go into a bookstore, make a selection from all the hundreds of books in front of you, pick something that looks like it will be fun, and then get so disappointment. this book feels like the author is just in it for a buck, like she knows she's gonna make lots of money off the thing and didn't bother to write something anyone's going to enjoy. maybe i'm being too harsh and she wasn't lazy but just untalented. but then how did she get into yale?the only thing i did think was funny was chloe wearing the garbage bag, and the part where she talks abut the ""non-eyes"" of a certain inaninmate object. but the rest was a huge waste of my money. i'm considering taking the book back to the store and trading it for something better..."
2,Not Very Impressive...,"I'm a big fan of Chick Lit novels and I was excited when I heard about ""Chloe does Yale"". I thought that the story line sounded great and I nearly dished out $20 to buy a copy for myself. I'm SO glad that I opted to borrow it from the library instead. While the book did have a bit of a plot and a decent character or two, I was disappointed with the novel and with Chloe. It had so much potential..."
2,Not terribly impressed...,"I found this to be a decent summer read for passing the time, but not much else. The cover definitely got me a few weird glances from people when I was trying to read the book. The story is rather blah, the characters and plot are predictable, and it's generally boring."
2,Don't compare to Sex and The City,"Chloe does Yale should not be compared to the series, Sex and The City because..well, there is no comparison to one of my favorite shows of all time.Chloe writes a column for the Yale Daily news called Sex and the (Elm) City. It's about her observations/experiences in college and trying to mate. Some of the nicknames & stories are funny, but it looses it's flavor toward the end of the novel and lost my interest. I have no idea how it ends. My review is just a head's up that if you think Chloe is going to be another Carrie, you'll be sadly dissapointed."
5,VERY FUNNY,"I really enjoyed this book. It's not really for the prude or intellectual types but I am an intelligent individual and I found this book very clever and humorous. Of course it is very similar to the hit tv series sex and the city. But I loved it! Great purchase and for all the people that gave it very low stars, I guess you don't know good humor when it's thrown at you."
2,"STOP HATIN, BE HONEST","damn, guyz, ok so it's not a good book, but why all the hate. it aint all that bad! review the book not the author. it isn't natalie's fault she's rich n privileged, u just wish u were too!! she didnt get to pick the society she wuz gonna be borne into. tho if she had u couldnt really blame her could u?? ;)"
3,So - So,"Compared to some really bad books I have read that actually got better reviews, this one wasn't too bad. Not one I would rush to recommend but entertaining enough. I guess maybe it seemed a tad juvenile since it takes place in college but I guess I should have expected that from the title. Still, I was hoping for a more mature take on the college scene. I mean I'm only 27, it hasn't been that long! Maybe it has something to do with Chloe being fairly straight laced, only a bit scatter-brained, and really not exceptionally wild. Could have been better."
2,uck,"This book would be good if the author didnt try so hard to be witty and humorous. All the little ""jokes"" come off as pathetic and make her look, uncool. She also makes Yale look like a school full of socially inadaquate losers."
1,WHAT IS THE POINT OF THIS BOOK? WHAT A SNORE!,How in the world did this book even get published????? I bet Krinsky had Mommy and Daddy shell out some dough for it..come on! get real- the publishers must have -oh I know theydo have- BETTER manuscripts than this garbage to publish !I thought the Nanny Diaries was bad but this takes the cake!Senior High creative writing at the very most and that's being kind!PS and do Mommy and Daddy know what a horrible pervert their daughter is or has clearly been turned into at ivy college???I am sure they are so very proud.Pah-LEEZE!
1,I miss Sex and the City,"And this is no substitute. It's kind of an insult to SATC actually, because it steals from it so shamelessly. The best friends are all the same, the columnist's last name is Carrington, etc. I mean, really shameless. It's ""chick lit"" I guess, but isn't chick lit supposed to be funny or something? And clever? And interesting. Chloe Does Yale doesn't quite fit those categories! There are a lot of reasons why, but mostly because, well, how to put this...Natalie Krinsky couldn't write a classified ad, much less a whole novel. Spoiled rich girls may be indulged by their parents, but businesspeople like publishers and editors might want to be a little more careful! Wait until a girl has some experience before you print her veiled memoir."
1,Cringe-worthy,"Oh god why, why have you plagued mankind with this rubbish? Is this the crap our ""best and brightest"" spew out? I should have stopped afer the first couple chapters, but like a train wreck, I had to keep reading. I derived about 3 chuckles from this book, and about 500 groans, 250 sighs of exasperation, and 100 self inflicted slaps for wasting my money on this.It's just not good folks. Just go rent some Sex and the City DVDs."
4,it is what it is and it's great,"it seems that the common complaint about this book is that it isn't soft porn. if you want racy, go for danielle steel -- real sex isn't always sexy, especially in college, and it's the dance that leads up to it that often provides the most amusement and fodder for commentary. krinsky's closer look at the yale social scene contains moments and insights that are relevant to anyone anticipating, in, or recently departed from college. it's a fun read and a welcome change from the dense and heavy high-brow lit that college is made up of. one note to those who have criticized krinsky's writing: your own reviews contain some of the most glaring grammatical errors i have seen in a long time. perhaps we should learn to conjugate verbs before criticizing published authors?"
1,"Spoiled, humorless, and tiresome","I should say one thing first--I'm a Yale student. I'm writing this from Yale. A couple days ago I read the interview and review from the Yale Herald, and when I saw some of the lines they quotes from Krinsky's book, I laughed so hard I almost choked.So I went over to the bookstore and I read a copy. The review was wrong. Chloe Does Yale is even worse than they said, so bad it first made me incredulous and then it made me depressed...one of my classmates wrote this? It's so talentless...so ignorant...and so unfunny. And by the way, the book does not accurately describe Yale students. What it describes is a small subset of us...the rich ones who are only here because of their money and their private school education in New York, the ones who have no idea that any black people go to Yale, the ones who are just here to get trashed and sleep around because they don't have to do any work study jobs to pay their loans and tuition.They are despised by the rest of us."
2,Titalation but no assets,"First novels can be the work of genius. Or not.Natalie Kinsky's ""Chloe"" has the right titilation factor (what do they really do on Friday night--and Wednesday night, etc--in the Ivy League?) and delivers with some amusing sexual encounters. However, the work is derivative, and not just in the obvious comparison to Candace Bushnell's original ""Sex in the City"" (""And so, I was wondering . . "") style and content. The rollicking ""Nice girls do it!"" approach is right out of Erica Jong's ""Fear of Flying"" from 30 years ago, but absent the brilliant cultural insights. And the opening college party scene is at best an homage to Brett Easton Ellis, at worst a rip-off.Most sadly of all, this is the ultimate ""fish needs a bicycle"" novel. The heroine puports to be an independent spirit who's not afraid to write dirty (and even tell her parents about it!) but she won't be fulfilled until she becomes the lesser half of a good man. Too sad."
2,Pointless,"This novel has it's humorous moments, but not much else. Little to no plot, next to no sympathy for the main character, no resoltion in the end. With so many more admirable stories out there I wouldn't waste my time. if you want to read a funny story, with a dash of sex and PLOT, check out Jennifer Crusie instead."
2,unrealistic & dissapointing,"If I did not live about 20 minutes from Yale, this book would've been a total waste of my time. I trudged through the first 100 pages or so just because I actually understood all the references to the Yale college scene. Other than that...this book was not worth reading.I agree with the other reviewers that it's just not as, well...raunchy as one would expect. I felt like I was reading the Sweet Valley High version of Sex and the City. And likewise, if the author wanted to pick a New Haven, CT college to set this novel in, she should've picked Quinnipiac (my alma mater unfortunately...). It would've seemed a lot more realistic set in a mediocre college than Yale for crying out loud!Overall, I don't recommend this book. It has basically no compelling plot, an immature writing style, and a fairly unrealistic setting, especially if you know what the New Haven/Yale scene is really like. There's better chick-lit (and especially better fluff) out there."
3,"Cute, fluffy reading that reminds me of college...","I am almost finished with this book. I picked it up upon reading a semi-bad review in People magazine. I have to admit as well, the cover and the title attracted me. Personally, the book is cute...I think it is well-done portrayl of a sex-craved college student. It is a little dry and borning at first, but picks up towards the end. You will laugh and relate, at least a little. I read all types of fiction - and while this is no intellectual masterpiece, it is a good fluffy beach read. Thanks Natalie!"
5,Holla,Krinsky's wit is as sharp as her ability to pick up on the details that define relationships. Her candor and sense of humor will disarm would-be critics's skepticisms with a quickness.
1,Wow...,"Can you pay Amazon to remove negative reviews? This novel had about a hundred terrible reviews, and every single one written before June 12th was magically wiped away.For those actually contemplating buying this awful book: the writing is bad, the narrator is uninteresting, the jokes are not funny, etc. Whatever you're looking for from chick-lit, you can find a better version of it in a hundred other novels. Do yourself a favor and avoid this dreck."
3,"starts bad ends well, fyi to the writer: originality helps","When I first started reading this book, I felt it was completely unoriginal. Every other lines is a refernce to either sex and the city, bridget jones diaries, and every other pop culture reference. I was half way through the book wondering if the author was ever going to develop her own voice. Finally in the last 20 pages the book seizes to revolve around other peoples material and takes shape. If only the whole book was written this way it would have been a great book. If your looking for fluff this is a good book, but if your looking to be enlightened or stimulated this is not the way to go."
3,A glorious work in its day,"A bit dated. But, in its day, this was a wonderful resource for planning. Published in 1986, the editors sought out experts to author individual chapters. Disclaimer: One of the editors, Irving Hand, is someone with whom I have worked since I came to Penn State Harrisburg.There are several sections to the book. The first provides background and context on the subject. The second part explores analysis and information (e.g., chapters on policy analysis, environmental impact analysis, and citizen participation). Part Three focuses on development policies and strategies, including urban development, rural development, andf economic development. The fvinal section addresses major types of state and regional plans, such as housing and transportation.Chapter authors include many experts in their specialties, lending real credibility to this work.("
3,"God, if you are looking at this, get a life!","Of course, here I am writing a review of this book. It isn't worth it. It's outdated, while parts of it are still useful."
2,Recipes not great,"I love the idea of this book however the recipes just aren't what I hoped they would be.They are not nice to use at all. Some of them it would be prefferable just to put oil on your skin and not waste all your time making something that feels like you're just putting oil on your skin. Home-made beauty products don't have to be like this, I've done a course on it since and the recipes we've been given definitley aren't like this.I think there are probably better books out there that use better ingredients (if you're going to use mineral oil you might as well just buy the mass produced crap)"
4,good basic formulas,"this book has some really great recipes but it has only four stars because it has some really hard to find ingredients. All in all it cover everything from soap making to eye gel and has some cute ideas for kids, like all natural play dough."
3,Good stuff but missing stuff,I really liked this book; however I wish there were more recipes for like soaks for pedicures & manicures & baths.
5,beyond fahabulous book!,"SUCH a great book! So many great recipes. As the author says, I'm sure that I will get addicted to natural beauty product making. I have been looking for a book like this for a while and it is absolutely great. The one thing I am worried about is how long the products will last...she doesnt really address that. otherwise, great format--easy, fun!"
4,Interesting and fun,"I really enjoyed this book. Initially, i borrowed this book from the library, but there was so much information, I had to buy my own copy. If you like to make your own beauty products and such, you'd probably enjoy it. There were several recipes that I had to tweak to make just right, but seeing as how everyone is different, that was to be expected."
5,Natural Beauty at Home Janice Cox,"This is a great book filled with lots of helpful information and recipes. I have read through it several times and plan to go through it several more. I have bought 3 books from Janice Cox; Natural Beauty from the Garden, Natural Beauty for all Seasons, and Natural Beauty at Home. I have personally tried several of the recipes in all of the books and have even began to work on my own style of products. Needless to say if you are interested in homemade beauty products that are easy on the budget, you should check out these books."
3,OK for beginners,The book has some interesting ideas and recipes but it covers mostly what is already widely known. Also in the recipes it does not clearly specify which facial preparations are going to be non-greasy day creams or greasy night ones.I expected to find some make-up recipes but they aren't in the book.Generally it is a good book for a beginner.
3,Oh Well---,It goes to show that good intension don't always pay off.Some of the recipes in Natural Beauty at Home sounded so good. But just try them. Wow. I guess it takes practice. Maybe I am all thumbs.Healthy Beauty using nature's secrets to look great and feel terrific by alternative health expert Letha Hadady has some amusing beauty recipes quoted from 19th century femme fatale Lola Montez. They are simple--even dumb--like putting steak on your face for wrinkles. But they work better than the ones I found in this book.
1,calls for borax?,"calls for borax in some recipes.and for shampoo get castile soap & then add other things, not too homemade to me.borax is not what i would be comfortable using."
4,gift,"Natural Beauty at Home, : More Than 250 Easy to Use Recipes for Body,Bath, and Hair (Revised Edition)my mum seemed to enjoy it very much"
2,Plodding but earnest,"A book for the Martha Stewart wannabe with unlimited time and money to spend tracking down exotic ingredients and cooking up potions on the kitchen stove. The book is probably okay for the retrogade do-it-all-yourselfer, but presents some daunting challenges to the casual home crafter who only wants to whip up something quick and fun at home. Especially not recommended for projects with children"
1,Not That Suspenseful ButI Purchased It Only Because Gorgeous Hardy Kruger Was In It,"This movie was kind of wierd but the main reason why I decided to purchase it was because my favorite actor gorgeous blonde heart throb Hardy Kruger was the main male character in it. I liked him and his charming, romantic role that he played but other than that Liane was typically boring and hardly spoke and there really wasn't any major suspense to this flick. Everything happened just too suddenly and fast paced. True, the picture quality was horrible in some scenes. I'd only watch this to see Hardy Kruger but not really because of the story. Dull, boring story, but it had the most gorgeous man alive in it, Hardy Kruger."
5,cleos voice is better than ever,"If you are a Cleo Laine and John Dankworth fan then you must get this album.Having heard Cleo and John live this album really does them justice.Cleos voice is smoother,lower and more in control than ever before.Its as if all the songs on the album were written to complement Cleos voice and Johns arrangements.Thankyou Cleo and John for many more hours of beautiful music."
5,This was one of his best,"Lewis is at boy-scout camp while he has left Rose Rita home by herself. So Miss. Zimmermann takes her on a road trip. As they go through a tunnel, they go to a different world!"
5,Back up,It works just as I thought it would. New computers don't come with floppy access. We still use it for an Embroidery machine .
5,Lovin the Potty Monkey,"Not only does my son love bringing the monkey with him to the potty, he sleeps with it too! I have to turn it to demo mode at night, because he doesn't sleep. I have memorized the board book that came with the monkey, it is a short little rhyming story, so it is easier for young children to remember as well. I have helped lots of kids learn to go potty in my years as both a mom and a child care provider, but my youngest son has been a true challenge. Though he still has a little to learn, this toy has made the work more fun and productive. My favorite part is when he sings the song! I think I play with this thing as much as my son does :)"
4,Great Idea,"What a cute idea- monkey see- monkey do! The monkey has an adorable voice, which is good- he talks a lot. He can be programmed for times so it can be better tailored to each child. My son loved flushing the potty and the book that came with it. I think this is a great idea, and have recommended it to friends."
3,Some interest,"Cute item, little interest in the monkey, not the potty. He likes to hear the monkey speak. No intrest in the book. Okay product.I would not buy again."
3,frusterating,The idea seems great and I really like the timer but the monkey does not know he is on the potty and keeps saying he needs to go. My daughter is upset that we can't get the monkey to the potty on time but I don't know what is wrong with it. It really made potty training hard! Lose the potty and just push a button or something.
3,needs more sofistication,"interesting item, didn't work at all in our case as my daughter was pretty much 'too old' for it and figured out that it's just another desperate parent try to take the power of potty away from her...lolanyhow, for children under 3 this may do the trick, but as a parent you need to turn off the timer at night and it's in an awkward spot so it's not so easy, i ended up putting it in a cupboard far, far away from the bedroom instead to not having to hear the potty alarm go off.personally i don't think it's worth the money. but again, it may do the trick for your child."
2,Would be great except for the tail,"My son loves how this monkey talks, and loves to flush the toilet (great sound). But who in the world designed this monkey WITH A TAIL?!? It's nearly impossible to get either the diaper or underpants on or off, even for me, since you have to work the long tail through an extra tiny hole. The tail also gets in the way so the monkey can't balance on the toilet very well--he usually falls off. So instead, we use some of his other toys on the toilet instead. The adult's book that came with the set is very useful, the children's book so-so."
5,Don't buy these,"I love these but don't buy them! I've done the mistake of buying a pack at petco for 20$ but if you just search for ""nail caps"" in ebay you can find them for 0.99-1.99$ for 20 with glue!! You can find every color you want any size and I swear there is absolutely no difference those are the only ones I buy I have them in all the different colors and I've never had a problem. I get them in size medium for my cats and they will last for 2-3 months no kidding! If you're gonna buy don't get scammed out of your money and buy 20 of these little things for 20$ that's a total rip off."
4,good stuff,"This is a great album of true power metal, along the likes of HammerFall and Iced Earth. If you like either of those bands, check this CD out, it's got GREAT vocals courtesy of Harry ""Tyrant"" Conklin and awesome guitar leads. I especially like ""Future Shock"" and ""Black."""
4,Contains some of JP's best songs,"I would not choose this album as JP's best album, that goes to Thane To The Throne, but it has some absolute gems. The album starts off with gem number one, the wicked BLACK. After some eerie violins and vocals a bitchin riff kicks in and the band starts rolling. The next gem is FUTURE SHOCK. I absolutely love the bridge and the guitar solo is great. SHADOW THIEF is a decent rock song, at least worthy enough to be on my i-pod. The next gem is SONNET OF SORROW, a short somber ballad featuring only vocals, guitar, and violin. The album closes with the last gem, the epic JUDGEMENT DAY. Great vocals, great chorus, great riffs, and awesome guitar solo! Joey Tafolla's lead playing is very melodic and extremely fluid. After the disappointing Dissident Alliance album it was great to have Joey and The Tyrant back in the band. I think most of JP's album have some great songs but this album has some of their best."
1,The Great Kamba Con,"This book is a beautifuly presented and photographed con. In my association with Maasai people since 1985 I have never known, seen or been informed of such mystical objects. The accounts of the Maasai since Hinde, Hollis, Merker through to Klump and onwards have never alluded to the existence of such items. In talking to friends in the Loita Hills early in 2001 the items were dismissed as Kamba carvings. Turle provides no provenance for these objects and does not ever appear to have collected the items personally from the Maasai - which would heve been so easy to do - always by way of an intermediary, who obviously hot-footed it to the Kamba carvers south east of Nairobi to fulfil the next order. Turle and Beard should know better given the long association with Kenya. A nicely presented book but useless."
1,Doesn't Work,of all the products that I have tried this was by far the worst one yet. It does nothing at all I wouldn't waste my money on this again if it were the last product on earth.
1,"No, really....who IS she?!","Who the heck is Jessica Andrews? I've never heard of Jessica Andrews before until I heard her song, ""Who I Am"", which is OK, but she's not as good or talented as LeAnn Rimes! And I heard the rest of this album, too. Most of the songs were pretty crappy, lame, and cheesy. If you're looking for good Country music, well you sure haven't found it here! Buy albums by Faith Hill, Billy Gilman, and LeAnn Rimes and you'll then discover the real Country music! Don't buy this album - a waste - buy Jessica Andrews's, ""Who I Am"" CD-single instead! Very disappointed. :("
4,Growing Up,"As much as I love Jessica Andrews' music, I dont think this album deserves 5 stars. Her first single Who I Am, is perhaps the best song on the album, which is why it went straight to #1. With as much talent this young lady has, Jessica Andrews should have number one hits with every single released, which is not the case, atleast not yet. Other standouts on this album include everytime, a sure fire cross over hit and Show Me Heaven, featured on the Dawson's Creek 2 soundtrack. Jessica has much promise, and will only continute to get better and im sure her popularity will also increase, Buy this album, although overproduced, Jessica still sings from the heart."
3,Not exactly Country music,Seriously when I first heard the song Who I am on the radio I never had heard of Jessica Andrews I thought that this was her debut album I never knew that she made a 1999 album. Who I am is o.k I really don't like the album and I bought it for the song Who I am but it turns out the album makes me dull and sleepy and as a guy I think girls will enjoy this one a little more. The music is sensitive and soft. Its not hard core country music niether there are not really any fiddles in it but for the most part she has a nice voice and is attractive but she can sing. Her voice is great I just did not like the music on this record it was too pop just way too pop! Take Karma for instance that is so not country so far from it and those are the kind of songs country radio turns away because there is no country in it.
3,Good CD but not as first one,"It's a good CD with catchy songs,but I personally think her first album is better."
1,Elevator Music,"Decidedly the best cut was Who I Am. I was disappointed with this CD and found the music sounding senthesised and spacy. The drums sounded like a drum machine. Also, her vocals were unemotional and boring. In a number of instances instead of going for the higher range, she wimped out and sang the lower note. I don't think she used more than one octave on anything but Who I Am. Although I enjoy Jessica Andrew's voice, I found she went plastic and safe with no maturing from the first album. In all, totally a waste of money. Too bad you can't return a ""bad"" CD."
4,A warm pop/country sound,"And I do say pop/country, not country pop, because she has gone a bit stronger on the pop side than the country which is too bad.Whatever, she still has a mature, masterful voice, and yet young enough to have fun with such songs as ""Karma"".""Who I Am"" is deservedly the hit song from this CD, and she does utilize the natural sounding warmth of her voice to the utmost here.""Helplessly, Hopelessly"" is a beautiful song, a bit more countrified than others. This is truly an honest, sincere musical statement she makes.""These Wings"" is my favorite, and I can't really tell you why. It's just a song that I find myself wrapped up in. Really, I would've thought that this would be more of a hit.And the final song, ""Show Me To Heaven"", is a good windup to a good CD...and I don't even watch DAWSON 'S CREEK! LOL"
4,She has a new sound!,"I thought the CD is excellent. I knew I liked her one song ""Who I am,"" but I did not think the rest of the songs on the CD would be great. I was completely surprised. The CD has much variety and is the type of CD you can listen to over and over without getting tired of. Therefore, I highly recommend anyone interested to buy this CD. It is excellent!"
2,A misguided critisism,"Anthony O'Hear goes to work with the idea that human beings has a nature, but that they also, to a certain extent, can act unrestricted of this biological nature. But like so many with the same starting-point he fails to show what he means by both the biological restraint and the moral freedom. His examples of instinct in people designed to prove our biological background are nothing but silly. A man responding to insult is one example. But everybody knows that there are many different ways of reacting to insults, from turning the other cheek to killing. So where is the instinct? The other examples are equally silly (A man responding to invasion of his territory and a mother - why leave out the father? - defending her child). ...."
4,"So far, so good","I finally replaced the stock strings on my Carvin (I was way overdue). After some research, I decided to go with these. I play mostly gospel/r&b; style, but I needed versatility for when I play in the pit of musicals that may require a rock, doo-wop, etc feel. So far, I've been happy with these strings. They were a bit brighter than I expected, but I imagine that as the oils from my hands build up a bit, they will get that low thump characteristic I've been looking for.If anyone has any suggestions for other strings that fit my style, I'd love to hear them."
5,My Long-Time Favorite,"I've been playing bass for 15 years now and, needless to say, have gone through just about every string there is. I always come back to DR Nickel Lo-Riders for their tone, tension, and longevity. They sound and feel excellent on my Lakland 55-02D, which has a 35"" scale, and perform equally well on 34"" scale basses. Another plus is the consistency of their product. With other brands (EB and D'addario), I've experienced quality variations from set to set, which I hate, but not so with DR. Bottom line: you can't go wrong with these strings! 5 stars."
5,You get what you pay for,"You'll either love this so much that it's worth the money or you wont. There really isn't any inbetween. Get a professional evaluation before buying. This will not be worth the money if you are using the wrong formula! The first time I purchased this product, I was unsatisfied. Then, I went to a salon and found out that I had been using the wrong formula for my hair type. Since I have been using the correct formula, my hair has become softer, shinier, less frizzy and never tangles. This is the only product I have ever used that makes it possible for me to brush my hair without breaking my hairbrush or wanting to shave my head and wear a wig. I have used other brands like Aveda, and although I do prefer natural alternatives, I'll gladly take whatever ingredients are in this because of the results. Like just about everything, what works for some may not work for others, so I recommend buying this somewhere with a good return policy like a salon the first time."
3,ITEM NOT AS PICTURED,"ITEM RECIEVED IS NOT THE SAME AS ITEM PICTURED. THE HAMMERS ARE DIFFERENT WITH SHORTER HANDLE AND DIFFERENT HEAD. I ORDERED THIS HAMMER AS I SPECIFICALLY WANTED THE ONE PICTURED. I COULD HAVE GOTTEN THE ONES SENT IN ANY HARDWARE STORE. THIS ITEM DESCRIPTION AND PICTURE SHOULD BE CHANGED TO MATCH THE ITEM, AS IT IS NOW DECEIVING AS TO WHAT YOU ACTUALLY GET.Stanley 54-304 5 oz Magnetic Tack Hammer"
4,"A Great Veriety Of Punk, Hardcore, and All that is good (kin",".......I would like to say that this is a great album, a good combo c.d. to get a good preview at whats up with Tooth and Nail. ....The best bands on here are the Juliana theory, The Dingees, Ace Trouble Shooter, Stavesacre, and Element 101"
5,Has Everything,"Wonderful collection of songs from the great Tooth and Nail Records. In the old days of the record company, these samplers usually only had six or seven good bands, with the others sounding pretty bad and unproffesional. Not so here. Every band sounds like they'd be a hit if only MTV would play them or something. No offense to hardcore fans out there, but I was glad that there weren't any in this collection, which is different than past Penaly Box compilations. All songs here are either punk, rock, and even includeds the wonderful hip-hoppish ""Are You the Walrus?""You will love this CD..."
3,"The worst of the penalty box cds, but not terrible","Ok, the fact that all of the songs sound basically the same was the main put-off when I got the cd. Add the fact that I already had two of the other penalty box cds, that are much better, makes this cd the worst in the series. They have some good songs by Stavesacre, Ghoti Hook, Juliana Theory, Dogwood, and Element 101, but they have too many songs on the cd to make it worth listening to the entire cd. And they have some really terrible songs in the Deluxtone Rockets and Furthermor. Ugh! If that's the future of Tooth and Nail no wonder MXPX left. I think I'll start buying some of their hardcore samplers from now on."
1,New Selections,"I think it is great that toothandnail is signing all these punk bands. I also think toothandnail could do a lot better if they signed some other bands to. Not all christians like punk, I for one do not. It turns me away from christian music. When i want to show my friends some of my christian music, I seem to always have nothing to show them because nobody likes punk. I think all these penalty cd need to have more selection. I don't think any of them could make it to MTV. They sound so disgusting. Tooth and Nail, help yourself by getting more variety!"
1,Game missing on the CD-ROM,"My son (4 1/2) LOVES Stanley and loved Tiger Time and the Gorilla book. He waited anxiously for Shark-Mad Stanley when we ordered it only to be disappointed because the game on the CD-ROM does not activate. On the back cover of the book, it states to click on the fish tank to launch the game but we have clicked to to avail. We even returned the book for a new one which had had the same result. I can't believe no one would test this software before it shipped or notice it for 2 YEARS!!"
5,A Question of Heaven,An amazing album start to finish. Awesome lyrics and amazing vocals. Matthew Barlow is one of the finest singers ever and here is where his voice shines the best. Just listen to A Question of Heaven and you will see why he is one of the best singers ever. This is Iced Earth's finest album. One of metals best concept albums. Check out this and Blind Guardian's Nightfall In Middle-Earth and you are in for one hell of a night. Buy this album NOW.
2,Review,"I tried to replace and my old hinge with yours and it had the exact same model number, but when i tried to use your hinge it didn't fit like the original. This was a waste of my time and money. Model numbers are used in order to match up parts, in this case it did not."
2,The big lie from Motown,"AARGH! The CD case lists the complete album versions of ""Love Hangover"" and ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough,"" but the idiots at Motown put the 45rpm versions of these songs on the album. I hope this is a temporary screwup and not an intentional lie. The CD is only 61 minutes long; surely there is room for the complete album versions (which would result in about seven extra minutes of music). The two stars are for the music, which is wonderful, of course. But somebody's head should roll at Motown for stating that the complete album versions of these songs are on this CD, since they are not! This is the reason I bought this CD! Conveniently, there is no ""quality control"" number at Motown listed on this CD; nor is there a web site. Disgraceful! I hope Ms. Ross is reading this!"
2,Ain't No Mountain long enough,"I couldn't agree with the reviewer below. I, too bought this CD thinking I was getting the full length versions of these songs. The single edits have been used to death, making the unedited versions a rarity.How many Diana Ross compilations will Motown force us to buy? The Ultimate Collection had the single edits of Ain't No Mountain High Enough and Love Hangover but was marred by horrible sound quality. The Hitsville boxed sets had superior sound but again the single edits. The Millenium Collection of Diana Ross had...the single edits, and now this!The songs should be replaced and a new catalog number issued so music buyers will know the difference. Ones that were ripped off, should be able to return the discs for a replacement.A rip off of the first order!"
3,"PLEASE , someone out there help me!","Of course the music here deserves 5 stars , but I of course wound up with the version with the 7"" edits ... and my copy even had the red + white sticker that read A Motown Classic ... !If somebody could please tell me how to get a correct copy of this album I will be forever in your debt! I know there's a way, I just don't know who to contact or how to do so.Please Help! Thank You! :)"
1,Not what it seems,I ordered this album expecting the a CD with 11 tracks.Unfortunately when the CD arrived it was only a 2 track sample of the full album. The CD was labeled with the same name as the full CD. I checked this website and didn't see anything that would make me think the CD was only a sample.I notified Amazon returns and had a prompt apology and the promise of a new CD sent out.When the 2nd CD arrived it was the same 2 track CD!When I came back to Amazon and checked the CD listing again I saw someone else left a similiar review - they expected the full CD but only got the 2 track sample.It doesn't look like Amazon is able to get the full CD.
3,MAKE IT 3 1/2 STARS BECAUSE I SAID SO,"There is no denying that Stone Cold is one the most colorful characters in the history of wrestling entertainment. This book was slightly above average. Its easy to read but I'll be honest, it just didn't provide me with the insight that I was looking for. The Stone Cold Truth is an autobiography that goes into detail of the many decent people in the wrestling business that Steve Williams has encountered. His failed marriages are a result of the profession that he has chosen and the man that he is -- neither are wrong. I read the book, I liked it. But I didn't love it and I wouldn't read it again because there is just nothing special about it. If you love Stone Cold Steve Austin -- this is the book for you. If you want real insight into wrestling entertainment seek elsewhere."
1,Where is the Story?,"I can say with confidence that this book is the worst wrestling book written to date(including Chyna's). Austin has no story whatsoever and the stories he does have, have been told on numerous occasions through wwe publications, dvds, tv, etc. The average chapter is four pages long and half of that is Jim Ross saying the exact same thing that Austin just said. The only thing we do learn here is that Austin loves Vince McMahon and shocker! this just happens to be a WWE book. This book honestly falls into the negative star category."
1,Stone Cold Waste Of Time,"Let me first say that I'm a big wrestling fan, and that I think Steve Austin is one of the best things to happen to wrestling in a long time.Having said that - DON'T read this book. Of all the wrestling books I've read, this was by far the worst. If you've spent even a little time on the internet or read articles in the WWE magazines, then you already know everything covered in this book.I understand that alot of wrestling books are ghosted, but this was the worst case. Seriously I'm not going into alot of detail - don't pick this book up.And that's the bottom line..."
1,Jim Ross ruins this book,"I was under the impression this was supposed to be Steve Austin's autobiography, but I was wrong. What it turns out to be be is part Austin's book and part some fat man with one eye crying about people he doesn't like. Ross makes many tasteless comments that should not have been printed. Most have nothing to do with Austin or his career. It just has to do with many personal vendettas of this mutant. This was unnecessary and Ross should have just wrote the preface like normal people do. He totally butchered and destroyed the book and this will turn off the reader. Its a shame because Austin was very honest bu ti ti is overshadowed by Ross's crying."
3,Stone Cold truth or the luke warm truth,"I would like to firstly say im a big stone cold fan and was looking forward tothis book egarly. I have read alot of wrestling books from Mick Foleys toPipers. So to hear the stone cold saga and find out how the man really feelsabout alot of things and people had me excited. I picked up the book and wellits written fairly well but you never seem to really get into the book and thestories revealed arent really told in the form you want to see them, there islittle real detail about anything, its basically a log of incidents of his lifewithout austin revealing how he really feels, which would have been the wholepurpose of the book. I enjoyed the book but finished quite disappointed as itnever really told you the full story. I guess they kept it quite politicallycorrect, so no wrestlers or the wwe would be upset by this book but if defiesthe purpose of the book really. If you like stone cold read this book but justdont expect a real insight into the man himself"
1,Not worth reading,"Steve Austin has to be the most selfish, cold hearted, disrespectful, hypocritical, arrogant egomaniac since Hulk Hogan and/or Vince Mcmahon. Austin expresses no remorse over Owen Hart's death whatsoever, whines about what happened at Summerslam 97, sucks up to Vince Mcmahon. You know I understand that when your with the W.W.E your book can very easily be promoted, but where is the logic in promoting a book based upon a company that is responsible for the publication of the novel, how honost can this story really be. Plus its Steve Austin, he is not exactly the sharpest tool in the box."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in Stone Cold's book mainly because after reading both of Mick Foley's books you really appreciate him writing it in his own language and style. You can totally tell a ""ghost-writer"" did Steve Austin's book and so the actual story doesnt feel like its coming straight form the hip...."
4,Stone Cold Truth,"My son has been reading this book for his college reading course. Although his teacher is not a wrestling fan, my son found the book to be filled with interesting information about Steve Austin's upbringing and family values that were enlightening. The book shows that Steve Austin is more than his persona that he projected during his wrestling career.The book is recommended for any fan of WWE wrestling and is an interesting read.Ira J. Bromley"
3,THE REAL TRUTH,This is a great dvd where you can find and understand the live of one of the most popular wrestlers in the world and you can see the begining of his professional life and you can follow his success whit his family and comentaries from persons like mick foley and in the extras you can watch him in great maches and great moments hi had in the spotr-entretaiment
2,Reads like a child's book,"I'm a big fan of Austin, but this book is really lame. He literally talks about the 3 biggest Wrestlemania's of his career in about 4 pages. It's like 'yeah, Stone Cold got huge', and that's it. No insight from him on how it felt to be the most popular athelete alive for a time.He also repeats himself over and over about his love for his children, parents, how he only has a handful of friends, blah blah blah.Very uninteresting read."
2,ENTERTAINING,"STONE COLD DOES A NICE JOB DESCRIBING HIS LIFE AND EXPERIENCES IN PRO WRESTLING. I ENJOYED THE EARLY PARTS CONCERNING HIS FAMILY AND FOOTBALL, BUT THE MEAT OF THIS BOOK IS HIS CAREER. STONE COLD WAS QUITE A CHARACTER AND MADE ME LAUGH MANY TIMES. I BELIEVE HE WAS ONE OF MOST POPULAR AND ENTERTAINING WRESTLERS OF HIS TIME. INJURIES, BURNOUT AND DIVORCE DID HIM IN. HE DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A BAD GUY, HOPEFULLY HE WILL DO SOMETHING ABOUT HIS DRINKING. FOR ALL WRESTLING FANS."
3,Stone cold truth.,given as a gift. not my cup of tea but maybe my grand son in law liked it.I hope so
4,Good read.,A good read for fans of Stone Cold but not as good as some other books WWE has put out. It was also obviously written but a ghost writer and not the Texas Rattlesnake. But overall a good book that kept me reading until the end.
3,Its stone cold,"Ive read three wrestling books so far bret harts, ric flairs to be the man and this one. What i liked reading about in these books is road storys and all the crazy crap that on the road. Bret hart did a great job in his, the stone cold book have very little road stories. If you watched his whole career on tv, or through dvds you will not learn any new information in this book, he just talks about how he got into wrestling and his best and worst moments. If your a stone cold fan i would recommend this book, if not I would read something else."
5,Oatey ABS Black cement,"Finally found this great ABS cement on amazom. They don't carry it in S.E. KY anymore. Used it 37 years ago to repair a Vetter fairing on my CB450K6. Using it now to make and repair boxes, trunks, electronics cases and brackets."
2,Aspect ratio,This fun film shows up on FOX Movie Channel in a letterboxed version. This DVD is listed as full-screen. That stops me from buying it.
4,Nice Solar/Atomic w/Leather Band,"If you're looking for a solar-powered/atomic timekeeping watch with a leather band, there are not a lot of choices. If a metal band is sufficient, there are a lot more choices at lower prices.I have another casio atomic watch (not solar) with a metal band, and the watch is much thinner than this one. However, the metal band is not as comfortable. As has been noted, this is a very thick watch, and would look much different if the picture shown were a profile.I have another solar atomic, this one completely digital, with the standard plastic band. It is also not as thick as this one. Something about the combination of analog hands/digital readout/atomic timekeeping/solar recharging make this a monster."
5,A Great Series,"If you're into Dragons, this is your book. Gives you great info on Dragons especially with the first book on Dragons... Dragonology which you'll want to get too. Both give you things to do, plus contain lots of hidden surprises that make reading them fun. Sort of a child's book for us adult and with lots to learn on Dragons."
5,Dragonology,"I purchased the book for my 13 year old granddaughter for Christmas. It arrivedbefore I expected it, in perfect condition and was exactly as advertised. My granddaughter was delighted with it."
5,Ologies,This is one of the funnest books in the series. You can feel the dragon skin in the book and open secret doors and envelopes and your imagination will soar to new levels as you turn each page. All kids would love this book and all in the group.
5,Best version of Tchaikovsky's yet,Tchaikovsky's Violin concerto is one of the most difficult pieces ever written for the violin. This version is the best preformance I have heard to date. All the passages are played crisply with confidence and bravado. There is no skimping of notes and slurring of riffs. This is the way Tchaikovsky would have wanted it played. This is a must for fans of this piece.
3,Not Sharp,"In the technical details this item was described as fully sharpened and the picture would seem to indicate this was true. It is not. It is painted and the groves are asymetric. True, it will work as is, but it takes more effort to cut (gouge) under the nail than if it were sharp. Fortunately, I was able to sharpen it with my grinder set. Not up to Stanley standards. I was able to look at othar pullers in the hardware store and they had the same problem, but that does not make it right.Regards,Les Whatley."
5,"Excellent acting, excellent movie",First rate acting; first rate movie. Kathy Bates and Jennifer are excellent in these roles. Great supporting actors too. Worth every penny and time in watching.
4,Where are all the Oscars this film deserved?,"Misery was a great film, but this so far surpasses it, that it is shocking that she did not take an Oscar for this. Playing the feisty and embittered title-character in 2 generations, Kathy Bates is certainly at her best. Jennifer Jason Leigh deserved at least a nomination for her portrayal of Selena, Dolores' daughter.Not a ""horror"" movie of the typical King sorts, but certainly a phenomenal look into the gut-wrenching pits of human hearts. If you liked Misery, this will be a divine gift to you."
5,Great movie,Love this movie every time I see it. Dolores is a cantankerous old woman who has put up with all she's going to. Mr. Mackey is no match for her.
5,One of King's Good Ones!,"I'm a King fan, but I can admit that the film adaptations of some of his books are real stinkers. Some just flat out suck. This film, on the other hand, is really good. It's not your typical horror, which I can appreciate, and it's definitely engaging. The actors did a great job; who doesn't love Kathy Bates? Also, they nailed the New England accent, which I also appreciate very much. Nothing does a film an injustice like a bad accent. Very good film!"
4,Great Suspense movie!,"I love Kathy Bates. I feel she is underappreciated and an extraordinary actress in hollywood. I often wonder why actresses as good as Bates are not given enough roles while brainless, waifs littered the television screens. Anyway, dont get me started on politics of America. I feel this is a movie for any woman who has been abused or can relate to how women are viewed and treated in a male dominated society. It seems atleast in the movie that women finally get justice for once instead of being on the other end of the rope. If you like a great thriller then watch this. ALso if you like the movie misery then you will like this Stephen King adaptation."
3,allcanadianguy@shaw reviews * * *,"Who would like this? : drama, thriller & suspense fansWorth seeing?...-buy it : 8 bucks! yes-rent it : yesCast:Kathy BatesJennifer Jason LeighDavid StrathairnJudy ParfittJohn C. ReillyEric BogosianChristopher Plummer____________________Taylor HackfordDirector* All movies should be 8 bucks! A good story from none other than S.King"
3,Washed Up King,"This is a right here right now washed up King after nothing through most of the 80s. Any horror elements are now completely gone and this is instead a serious drama. Feel sorry for King after the last scary thing he made was the made for TV It. King just isn't scary any more, neither is any more recent horror. Only Dario Argento and the cult of Fulci can keep horror alive now."
2,Predictable and un-enjoyable,"I have seen this movie several times, and each time, I find it to be more un-enjoyable, and poorly developed. It does no justice to the book."
5,A GREAT FILM,"This is a Stephen King story (not one of his horror stories either) and it couldn't have been better! A story about a woman who is constantly being misunderstood, but actually is pretty sane. A woman who is mistaken for a troublemaker but seems to be the ONLY one with common sense while everyone else around her is warped. I don't wish to say more because I don't want to give any of the story away, but by all means WATCH IT if haven't. Kathy Bates gives a BETTER performance that her one in Misery (another Stephen King story) and should've won a second Oscar."
5,Worthy of All of its Awards and More !,"This film us brilliant storytelling...and the directing and acting makes full embodied characters believable, humanly understandable, hence you do embrace the characters. The outcome is unpredicatable---hence a fine mystery."
5,Treasure Trove of Great Acting Talent!,"This movie is overflowing with brilliant acting skills by some of todays best actors. Kathy Bates brings it on home in this movie as Dolores (St.George) Claiborne. It really captures the mood of the book and is such an underated film classic. This movie has another leading lady by the name of Jennifer Jason Leigh who also delivers an oscar worthy performance. She usually does in every performance. The supporting cast includes Christopher Plummer, Judy Parfit, John C. Reilly and David Strathairn. Sometimes the mind can play tricks on us or is the mind really what helps us survive something so horrendous. Judge for yourself after the movie."
5,"A tremendously scripted movie with multiple sub plots. One of Kathy Bates best acting performances, should have received oscar.","Not only one of Stephen Kings best works, but Kathy Bates does a masterful job in her role. I honestly cannot picture anyone more perfect for the part. Each subplot is just as relevant as the previous, the cinematography is exceptional, and the supporting cast is second to none. This film would not be as exceptional as it is without the contributions of Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Christopher Plummer ( always terrific in his roles ), David Strathairn and John C. Reilly.Surely one of those movies you can watch repeatedly without concern."
3,It is ok...,"It is ok, but don't expect it to follow the book closely. It is based on the book, but many events are in a different order, characters are added, omitted, etc. I really wasn't a fan of Jennifer Jason Leigh's character and performance. Overall, I preferred the book's version of characters and events more then the movie. However, I did enjoy watching Kathy Bates performance :)"
3,Suspensful adaptation of a King shocker,"DOLORES CLAIBORNE is a thrilling piece, beautifully photographed with at least two genuine shocks in it. Kathy Bates gives a knockout performance, ably supported by a young Jennifer Jason Leigh. Like all King adaptations, it's compulsively watchable, even though the basic subject-matter is familiar. Definitely worth a look, even though by the end of this piece, audiences feel as if they have been through the emotional mangle, just like Dolores herself."
4,Bates Pulls it Off,"What could have been an overly dramatic, soppy Hollywood movie fraught with politically correct cliches, was saved by Kathy Bates with her understated facial expressions and believable stoicism. She made the film spellbinding."
4,Misery loves company.,"First off; this is a much better movie than the overrated ""Misery"". The story, the acting; it all just works better. There is one ""problem"", though. -The casting of Leigh as the daughter. Don't get me wrong; she's a brilliant actress, and she's also very good here, but the fact that she doesn't look the least bit like Bates is a quite irritating and distracting observation. (With some good will she may resemble the father, Strathairn, but you have to be in a rather optimistic mood to see it.) The perfect choice might have been Tammy Lauren, but I guess she just wasn't a big enough star, or well known at the time. I'm still hoping some bright casting director will see the light as well, and put them together - now, that would make one hell of a powerhouse duo !. Still, this is one of the best King adaptions."
5,KATHY BATES IS SUPERB.,"Talk about an overlooked performance....In ""Dolores Claiborne,"" Kathy Bates turns in an Oscar-caliber performance that is just as good, if not better, than her Annie Wilkes in ""Misery."" Timing was off on the original release of this film...It came out in early Spring and by the time Oscar voters were perusing performances, Ms. Bates was forgotten. It's too bad.... By all means, pick up this film for her acting, and for a fascinating, extremely well made film."
5,Look at us Now!,"I just need to add my approval, the best live thrash album I've heard. Better than most studio ones too. This album kicks with the intensity that thrash had back in the late 80's, with the production of Andy Sneap. It's bone crushing, the guitars and drums sound fantastic. The performance is inspired. Baloff sounds like a maniac having a ball. I'm not 100% sure what he means half the time, but in a break between songs, when there's a bit of banter and some idiot in the crowd yelling ""Just play....just play"", the riff starts, Baloff bleats ""Look at us Now!"", the drums kick in and there's just a f$%K off level of power that no one could refute. Floored!"
3,not your usual exodus,"o.k. so there's really like two exodus bands, there is the extremly crappy vocals and recordings of the old and very slow exodus and then there is this, pure heavy metal at it's best. i can't quite describe it because the difference between their live recording(this one) and there studio recordings are like the difference of night and day, I am still puzzled to this day why this is so fast and brutal and the other stuff is a joke. the only reason I gave it 3 stars and not more is out of respect to the higher scores. if it were a 1-10 rating system I'd give it a 7 and a half"
5,"Ain't no gold fish, ain't no trout, this is PIRANHA!","The most dense/heavy guitar sound I have ever heard on a CD. Killer songs with a sound that will slay you. Every member of this band is a killer musician, Paul you are an animal. Buy along with Priest's Meltdown and wreck your neck."
3,"nice gadget, but produces too much waste","I bought this product many years ago and it's still in great working condition.However, I don't use it nearly as much as I thought I would. I have also started being increasignly concerned about packaging foods in plastics and BPA leakage. I'm also annoyed that the packaging can only be used once and I'm producing too much plastic garbage. So while the product performs as promissed, I will give it away and find alternate sources for food storage."
4,Great for a novice dancer,"I brought this book and it had a lot of great information for those, who would love to begin their journey into Middle Eastern dance. It covered just about everything. I did find however I read some articles before in belly dance publications. It is a great resource of history & resrach of the dance as a whole. Anyone who needs a one stop guide to the novice dancer..."
3,Not what I expected,"This is a wonderful book on history, the bellydance revival movement, costuming and doing this as a business. It also has an excellent list of teachers and outfitters, and beautiful pictures. However, I expected more on dance movements as they apply to styles/countries, and suggested exercises for learning this art. I also did not expect the rather large section on snake dancing. I am an ophidiophobe, and whereas I am sure that this is a fine art, I found it really bothered me to even have this book in the house. I have since passed it on to another interested party, and have found some other books that combines have provided me with the information this contains. Though I am sure it is nice to have this information in one place."
4,great resource for new students,I still enjoy this dance reference. It is a compilation of many many styles and forms and ideas and it gives a nice overview. I have enjoyed the resource lists at the end of the book and still refer to them on occasion.
2,Something Missing.....,"To keep this short and simple, the reason this recording got 2 stars (and not 3 or even 4) is because taylor hawkins has a long long way to go in finding his voice (like his counterpart, Grohl, I'm sure he will over time). The whisper-y, monotoned, near emotionless singing really takes a toll on the listener. The music is above average although I waited the entire cd for the guitar and drums to break open (they never did). They say this is classic rock, but its not. Classic rock finds a way to let loose and really take ahold, something these musicians never do. It felt as if the music was restrained, even held back. Nothing new or exciting was ever brought to the fore front. Very timid throughout. A few touch ups and reworking of the songs, more freedom for the musicians, some excitement and feeling from hawkins, and a good guitar solo would have put this cd over the top. Its too bad. Hawkins' drumming (his obvious natural talent) is awesome though."
3,Spy Dude,"This book very confusing and I barely know what's happening (so far). All I know is there's this dude named Keyes, Sammy Keyes. Sammy is mysterious. He is like a spy dude. People think he is kind of weird, But they can't know for sure because he is mysterious! Sammy is trying to find snake eyes (dice) but you will have to read the book to find out why this is important. This is not my favorite book because it is too confusing. -Drew"
4,Data Analysis,The book was sent to me in good condition - the condition it was described. I have no complaints.
3,Ok but nothing to go crazy for,"I have to agree with some of the other reviews that say this doesn't stand up to the 1st and 2nd movies. Yes, Seth states in the crawl that you should keep an open mind. In the commentary they say, ""some of these jokes are recycled."".But...There are some funny scenes in this and if you are a true fan of Family Guy, you will buy it. The majority of the humor seemed more like they were poking fun at holes in the plot of Star Wars than just having fun with their own characters. They even brought characters from Seth's other shows into this movie and made a joke at their own expense about it. Near the end, Chris and Peter do the traditional ""Seth Green bashing"" comments back and forth which were funny in the past but the whole, Robot Chicken vs. Family Guy thing is getting old. Now when Chris turns it back on Peter saying ""I hate Seth McFarlane."", I had to laugh.So you heard it here.I personally liked it but DID feel it fell short of the humor found in the other 2 movies."
1,Wont play on my Computer!,The DVD will not play in my computer. It makes me download itunes in order to play it. The DVD itself wont run in the DVD player software on my laptop it only plays on my stand alone dvd player. I am saying this b/c it really is an inconvenience.
3,Its A Crap!,"The opening scroll of this movie tells a true story. MacFarlane phoned this one in and he says so. This is basically just Jedi animated with the cast of Family Guy instead of the actors from the movie . There are hardly any gags. The ones they do are tired, rehashes. They take the nodding routine way too far, so it's not funny so much as tedious. Of the 3 Family Guy-Star Wars spoofs this is by far the weakest. The Robot Chicken 1 hour Star Wars III special was much funnier."
1,Not worth it.,"Maybe we could've enjoyed this, as we did the first two.But when the producer himself is telling you, beforehand and during the episode, not to bother, well it's hard to fall for the tyranny of low expectations. Stick with the first one. Don't bother with this one."
1,"Poor effort, a blemish on the first two family guy efforts","SAVE YOUR MONEY.Buy blue harvest and something something something darkside, these were two GREAT features. Honestly, this remake starts off with an apology about how bad it is. At first I thought this was a joke then quickly realized it wasn't. Family Guy writers and Seth McFarlane should be ashamed, what a waste and abuse of viewer trust. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD."
1,Wouldn't Watch It Again,Blue Harvest was good. SSDS was a disappointment. This one was equally if not more disappointing. Not funny. Lots of time dragged out to the max. Clearly the Family Guy brand is dying.
1,"Wait a year until Fox airs it, save your money","The crawl at the beginning has MacFarlane explaining that he didn't care about this and he let the assistants write it. Then the characters joke about how bad it is during the film. I loved the first two, but I didn't laugh more than about 3 times during this thing. Family Guy is great because it combines intelligent and low brow humor, which was severely lacking in this installment. Besides, Fox just likes to sell this on DVD first so they can make some cash, so just wait until Dec. 2011 and watch it for free on TV. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
3,Buy the boxed set of all 3 Family Guy Star Wars remakes,"This is Family Guy's version of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi with Chris as Luke Skywalker, Peter as Han Solo, Lois as Princess Leya, Bryan as Chewie and Stewie as Vader. It is good, but it feels more like a sceen for scene remake of Return of the Jedi instead of a parody like Space Balls. Like Star Wars with Family Guy flavor instead of something new and original. There The episode feels like it is being too honest with the fans and their longest joke is about how bad Seth Green is. The opening prologue is about how Seth MacFarlane really ran out of ideas, but the studio wants to push him to do the DVD. It really feels like the longest jokes are coming from reality behind the scenes and not from the source material or Family Guy. The DVD has commentary and a few making ofs. All three of these Star Wars remakes could have been on a single DVD and there is a boxed set with all three, so save your money and buy that one instead."
1,Makes Jedi look like a masterpiece,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Family Guy, but this steaming pile of Bantha Turd makes that other crap-fest, ""Jedi"" look like absolutely brilliant. I, like Buck, got about 3 laughs out of this. Even though Seth opens with a disclaimer in the crawl, it was not at all meant to be taken as a joke. This-plain-SUCKED. Thank you, Netflix, for saving me from buyer's remorse."
2,don't get trapped into watching this,"we've watched all the Family Guy movies and are pretty religious about watching the tv show too, so we were surprised at how NOT funny this one was. It just wasn't clever like most Family Guy shows/movies are. We were very disappointed."
2,Not worth the money,A openign credits int he begining say it all. they really didnt try at all with this sequal. it was boring and i didnt laugh at all during the movie it was nothing but a complete waste of time.
2,Maybe 4 laughs...in 56 minutes,The first Star Wars ep was great...2nd was mediocre and this one is just awful...Seth Macfarlane continues his trend of doing a joke over and over and over again and fails to realize it wasn't funny in the first five seconds (there is one scene where they nod at each other endlessly).The first 25 minutes were pretty much laugh free...there are maybe 4 good jokes...I will say the computer animation and score (i.e. the original one) is fantastic. It's a real shame they couldn't hire a writer capable of producing anything remotely funny.
2,Wait for it to get under $10,"This edition to the Star Wars parodies was a big let down. Seth even mentions in the opening that they basically ran out of ideas for this one and other things, after watching this its SO true. I will admit I did laugh at a few things but that doesn't say much. I recommend waiting for this one to get down to the $5 price range."
2,"Potentially good, but save your money","Any show that opens up with an apology for such a lame event is either truly apologetic, or a cynical move at nudge-nudge-wink-wink, let's just pretend we're apologizing. Either way, this had a potential for being hilarious: the other two shows were quite good, ""Blue Harvest"" especially. Not this one. The opening title sequence even tells us that ""assistants"" did all of the writing, and it shows. I could even tell when the writing staff just said, ""Hey, let's do another one of those extra-long 'jokes' like we do in 'Family Guy', where it stops being funny after 45 or 50 seconds of doing the same thing."" I bought the trilogy, having seen the other two before by borrowing my friends' DVDs, so the purchase wasn't a total waste. Save your money, just borrow it from someone else."
1,Just Awful,"I found the first two really funny. When the opening lines said that it was going to be really bad and to lower my expectations, I thought 'no that's not possible, family guy is always funny'. Sadly this was not, the jokes were very forced and relied heavily on jokes they have used in the episodes. Conway Twitty bit was boring as usual and when they all start signally each other jsut goes on far too long.To quote the comic book guy 'worst episode ever!!'Don't waste your money!"
1,Phoming it in,"Not worth it.The running joke of the show is ""Fox made us do it"". I'm sorry (Seth Mcfarline) you made a successful show ripping off another successful show and you have to carry the network. It's odvious the jokes are steal old Seth only does half the commentary no real extra to speak of. not worth buying wait for it to be on Adult Swim."
4,FUNNY ending to the funny trio.,"I don't understand the negative reviews to this movie. It is every single bit as good as the first two, people are just being analytical for the sake of trying to stand apart.I won't get into lengthy reviews, because I'm sure people already have.Just watch it. It stays true to the feeling of the first two, and is consistently funny. American Dad fans will be in for a treat, as will people who remember the Ostrich and Angela. Great points are made, and Quag-3PO will make you laugh your *** off.4/5 only because the Sarlaac Pit staring scene went on for way too long."
3,Family Guy has lost its edge,"The very first Family Guy Star Wars Episode was amazing. The second one was horrible and this one not much better. I can watch Blue Harvest over and over and not get tired of the jokes. Maybe I am getting older but I just don't enjoy FG like I used to. The humor on the show is way too political and mean spirited. It is almost as if they are switching to a Matt & Trey style of comedy (say the edgiest thing possible just cause you can, not because it is necessarily funny or adds anything). I re-watch seasons 1-4 and really enjoy it but the most recent seasons are pretty bad. It is seems like the best writers are now on American Dad and Cleveland Show."
2,Not good,"By telling us they didn't care ahead of time, it took all hope of it being funny out of it. Laughed maybe 3 times."
3,It's a Let Down.,"After the first two,""Blue Harvest"" and ""Something Something Darkside"", I was looking forward to this one. Boy was I disappointed.The scroll at the start of the film warned that this one was an afterthought and was only made because they were offered a car load of money. I should have taken them at their word.The jokes (?) came across as, at best, lame. More often they fell flat. The writing, such as it was, seemed limp and forced. If they thought that it was funny to keep winking at the viewer, as if to say ""we told you we only did this one for the money"", they missed the target by at least ""a parsec"".At least I have the whole set. But I cannot recommend this as being near as good as the first two.Sorry, but I just can't."
3,Eh.......,"Though I loved the first two Family Guy Star Wars spoofs, this one fell a little short of the others.It is a short movie, about 48 minutes, so it's basically the length of two regular episodes (or ready to play on Fox with lots of commercials in either 1 hour or 1.5 hour format). This feature follows the events of Return of the Jedi with a lot of rewrites of course.There are some funny moments, such as the Emperor in the swimming pool; but overall this did not amuse me as much as Something something Dark Side. But for those who are either Family Guy fans or just fans of fun Star Wars spoofs, it's a nice diversion. Just either rent it or wait for it to be aired on tv. I'm glad I rented it."
3,my least favourite of the three Family Guy Star Wars Parodies,"here we have Family Guy with their third and final episode in a trilogy, parodying the final episode of Star Wars,The Return of The Jedi.this episode,while still funny,is at least to me,not as funny as Blue Harvest,the first episode,and certainly not as funny as the second episode,Something,Something,Something,Dark Side.nor is it as clever or fast paced.it's still a good episode and there some funny and clever moments,but of the three,it's my least favourite,just as Jedi is my Least Favourite of the original Star Wars films.however,i would still recommend purchasing the Family Guy Trilogy.i think it's worth it for episode one and two.all three of the episodes are longer than the broadcast versions.for me, Family Guy:It's a Trap is a 3/5"
3,"Stupid yes,but it knows that it is!",OK I think if you watch this as a long time Family Guy viewer you will enjoy yourself. It is stupid silly fun and takes as much time to trash Family Guy as to make fun of Return of the Jedi. It's silly and stupid and if you take the time to enjoy it in this light I am sure you will enjoy it more. I am sure some will hate the use of characters from The Cleveland Show and American Dad but hey just sit back and laugh.
4,It's finished,"This Return of th e Jedi is about the same as the live action version only quicker. Yes, a few of the gags ran long, but overall it is a good show. Not as funny as the first two, but funny. Enjoy."
2,The trilogy should have ended at 2,"I am a big fan of Star Wars and loved the Family Guy spoofs of the first two. The third, however, lacked everything. The jokes and sly comments were lame, the story was boring and the conflicts so week it was non-existant. There was more hatred from Stewie towards Lois than from all the characters and Darth Vader/Lord Cydeaus. I have it to complete the set but I don't know when or if I'll watch it again. Not recommended if you haven't purchased it yet. Save your money."
2,"Meh, about as lame as expected","It's a Trap! is about as lame as you can expect. While it has its funny moments (Seth Green's Entourage mentions), it's no better than a lackluster regular episode. The only scenes really worth watching are the ones with Carter as Palpatine, and even then Stewie's awful Vader drag those down. Watch it when it comes to television. Don't waste your money on this painful hour of Family Guy."
2,Not as good as the first two.,"Don't waste your money. This was obviously put together in a hurry with little effort. Maybe if they stopped wasting time with The Cleveland Show (also bad)they could have produced a better version. Instead get your hands on the Family Guy/American Dad 2010 Christmas episodes (TiVo?), they where much, much better."
2,IT'S A TRAP,It's ok. Worth it if you got the Blu-ray pack for 22.99$. It's a Trap! was the worst one of the bunch. Almost seemed as if they really didn't want to do that one. Way to much bad language(To much for kids anyway) in the last one with no point to it.
3,The farce is weak with this one...,"I had to have the 3rd installment to complete my collection and it's OK. I had some hope that McFarlane and company would put a little more effort into this one. So many opportunities to make this one the best of the 3 Star Wars spoofs. Most of the episode seemed rushed and made with a lack of enthusiasm. With all that is available within the Star Wars universe, it is hard to understand why Fox and the Family Guy staff did not want to put forth their best. Just give me some more good regular Family Guy. Don't bother with another installment."
5,BRAVO TO MR.DUTTON & VOCALION,"THIS IS THE BEST GLENN MILLER CD I'VE EVER HEARD! SUCH CLEAR SOUND! IT'S AS IF IT WAS RECORDED YESTERDAY!! BRAVO AND A BIG KUDOS TO MR. MICHAEL J. DUTTON AND VOCALION FOR USHERING GLENN MILLER INTO THE 21ST CENTURY! SHOULD BE AN ESSENTIAL ADDITION TO YOUR MILLER COLLECTION! IF YOU HAVEN'T A COLLECTION, START IT WITH THIS ONE!"
3,mmmmmmmmmmmaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhooooo a donut!!!!!,"ive only heard one song and its great, evil, scary, dark, gothic music! i will write a better review when i get round to buying the album.P.S. buy odyssey into darkness by elegeion"
5,Fun bounce.,"Electro breaks providing funk and trance overtones with a bit of pop shine that works and is put together in a crisp little package. Definitely a good representation of Florida sounds. Don't let the cheap inserts fool you, because this disc is much tighter in terms of production and length than prior Eros releases. It is a shame that this stuff isn't played on the radio more.Tracks to hit (though all are good!):2. Dreamscape5. Pinwheel13. Find My Way"
3,Problem Handled,"After receiving the wrong hammer, tool fetch did send a prepaid return shipping label and issue a full credit. ( Problem ended up handled fine )"
4,Good For General Language Learners,"Although I agree that this book is not necessarily for linguists, I do think that it was a God send when I was learning Arabic dialect in Yemen. This book will help you to realise that there are priorities in learning a language and also gives you some ideas about how to learn a language that there are no texts for. The principles in this book are for lay persons and I personally think that this is a good companion for any anthropology student serious about doing field work. As a teacher of English as a second language, I recommend this to fellow teachers."
1,waste of $,"This book is a summary of learning methods, but deals mostly with theory, philosophy, details of research etc. I wonder why a scientist advertises approximated pronunciation- should he also advise approximations in the matter of his research??? This is not a book for linguists - here the language is just a tool. I could find on the net more than in this book. Alan Healey wrote a realy good one, maybe SIL still has it on microfiche."
2,Poorly Written,"I regret buying this book. It is poorly organized and poorly written. I had to wade through fractured English, repetitive points, and illogically ordered topics to try to get the information I needed. After a couple of hours, I gave up and ordered a different book."
1,Requires VB.Net,"This tome is very poorly written. I suspect English is not the authors' first language. Of the four projects demonstrated, only the first uses VBA. The other three are built with VB.Net. Premier Press continues to be a book publisher to avoid."
4,Informative,"The book is very informative and covers all the aspects of VBA programming. It also gives a brief and intro to VB.net which is something I really liked. There are 4 projects in the book, which also gives you a hands-on the concepts taught in the book.I have done all the projects covered in the book myself and they seem to be very real-life applications."
4,"Good DVD Player, Especially for the Price","Thinking about the Samsung HD-841 - forget it! That player is horrible. Frequently froze up, refused to play many brands of DVD-Rs and would not play DVD+R DL discs. I bought the Toshiba SD-6980 in hopes of getting all that I had wanted from the HD-841. The Toshiba player is great. It handles all of the DVD-R and DVD+R I've thrown at it and plays DVD+R DLs as well. Also does a great job with DVD-Audio and SACD.The player could be a bit more attractive - it has a bit of a ""retro"" look to it."
5,Works great with my G5 iMac.,"Unlike other flash drives it stores document data, like icons and creation dates, when used with my iMac."
2,Interesting subject by bad writer,"First off I am not a book critic. My immediate observations about this book are that it is;poorly written, disjointed, rambling, with a smattering of incoherent sentence structures that leaves you wondering just what he is talking about. At times a jolly good read if you could deduce where they are and how they got there at any given time. What date it is anyway! What came first? Did, this chap die 20 pages ago or not? Most of the places mentioned are not on the map. (You will need a magnifying glass to read it) There is scant little development on the main participants and too much information on minor officers and men who die at a particular battle but have never been mentioned at all before.There may be some good history here but you will need to keep a scorecard ready to follow any chronological order. It seems clear that a good ( OBJECTIVE) book on this subject could not be accomplished in less then 700 pages."
3,The West vs Islam in a Different Era,The West has fought with Islamic fundamentalists before: in the Sudan in between about 1880 and 1998. This book tells that story. As general history it's OK but for the military detail it is somewhat lacking. There is also an annoying tendancy to a Tarentino-esque timeline. Great in Pulp Fiction (and Lord of the Rings as it happens) but well executed in this case. Many of the big names of WW1 got their start in this ugly series of wars. Logistics reigned supreme and tactics were relegated to frontal attacks along lines of communication.
4,Son loved it!,"Lots of easy and very good recipes. My son is an awesome cook and has recently gotten on a cast iron kick - got this for him at Christmas and he has used several recipes from this book. It also has some awesome ""how to"" hints for the new CI user! Would order again."
1,Not general enough.,You would have to have every kind of cast iron pan ever made to make all of these recipes. Plus some of them sound kinda nasty.
4,Great Product,"There are some really great recipes in this book. I have been trying many of them. I recently bought a cast iron skillet and a dutch oven from Lodge cookware and my family has been enjoying many new meals.I also recommend the book ""A Skillet Full"" available here too."
2,"Fun toy, but NOT for sitting!","I purchased two of these chairs for my twins, they love them. They keep getting dumped forward out of them, however, almost every time they try to sit in them. They are 16mo old, and not big babies, but they don't have room to turn around in them to sit without grabbing the top and pulling the whole thing over on top of themselves. They had a blast laughing and playing on top of the tipped over chairs however! (Once they got over the intial head bump on the carpeting!) Perhaps these chairs belong in a different category! They will be returned for sturdy upholstered chairs like my older children have had. The cover looked like it could easily be unzipped/removed for washing if needed. Cute and colorful, but not functional!"
5,Fantastic for a toddler/older infant,"My 14 month old daughter absolutely loves this chair. It is deep and pliable, which means that she can sit in it without falling out as well as move her legs around in it comfortably. It is extremely light and close to the ground. Even if she does manage to fall out of it, she is already at the floor. Also, the cover zips off for easy cleaning.I highly recommend this chair!"
4,Ugly...but she LOVES it! ;o),"Well, when I saw this gift on Christmas morning I thought, ""no way are we keeping that!"" It's ugly, but growing on me. And, we are keeping it because my one year old daughter loves it. She can get into it by herself. My only complaint (other than how it looks) is that it tips over pretty easily."
4,still works,"Had for a while still works, the gas gauge goes up slow when you fill it i dont know why."
5,Wonderful Product,This product is by far one of the best clay masks I have ever used. It leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth. Decreases pore size tremendously. Use once a week and you'll see and feel the difference.
2,Good book terrible translation,"First, I have read this book in French as it was available for free as a Kindle download and a friend suggested that its much better then the English translation. As my French is a bit rusty I decided to also read it in English. It was a mistake. The translation is a the worst I ever saw. It felt as if a 16 year old set down with a dictionary and attempted a word for word translation. It was so painful after the beautiful French version that I had to put it down 20 pages into the book, as it was unbearable. I am giving this rating for the terrible translation not to the book."
1,divine decadence,I never reicieved it after several weeks I got a refund with no explation. I have not had this problrm with other ordres except it takes too long to receive
4,"Brilliant Power Pop, Excellent Rock","Okay. First let me say that the lyrics are somewhat . . . basic; but I firmly believe they add a great amount of emotional color, particularly with his delivery, and his voice just keeps getting better. From the opening guitar shucking of ""Standing On My Own Again"" to the mid-tempo wind-down of ""See a Better Day,"" there are some great effing tunes on this album. It's a step up from ""Happiness in Magazines,"" a great record in its own right. The melodies and rhythms stay with you. At least, they stay with me. Enjoy."
4,Somewhat Shallow Fun,"I'll start by saying that I am not more than an extremely casual fan of Blur. I don't own any of their records and have never been impressed or dissatisfied with anything I've heard by them.On the other hand, this album has got something that captures my interest. I find myself listening to it at least once per week. I can't say exactly why. The lyrics are simple, the music is very predictable at times, and under most circumstances I'd consider something of this ilk to be overproduced. Despite all of this though, it works. It's upbeat and positive without being sugary, and the choruses are all devilishly catchy without being repetitive (for the most part). The track ""You & I"" never fails to put me in a good mood.I must admit the overall ""Britishness"" of it is also charming to a yank like myself. Much of this album would probably be down right annoying from an American band.In conclusion, even if you aren't a fan of Blur, you may find something here worth a listen."
3,Carbon-Copies Album,"There are a few quality songs on ""Love Travels at Illegal Speeds"" but overall I was quite disappointed by the album.Where most artists tend to expand upon their sound, broaden their scope, and improve upon the originality of their songwriting, Graham Coxon appears to be going backwards. I wasn't exactly sure what the point of this album was, as the majority of the songs are merely carbon-copies of other artists' styles and genres; if I want to hear the Sex Pistols I will buy one of their cds, or the same thing for The Beatles.After hearing the originality and quality of Coxon's previous work from ""You're So Great"", ""Coffee & T.V."", ""Bitter Tears"", or ""Escape Song"" it was quite a let-down to hear such uninspiring and basic music on his latest work.This is not all bad news however; perhaps Mr. Coxon is running out of ideas and may have all the more reason to rejoin Blur so they can put out their best work yet."
2,Insulting to my intelligence,"This solo artist looks and sounds like Austin Powers, when the latter was rocking out in one of his movies. At least in Austin's case, it was a spoof. Nothing new here in guitar sounds, and the lyrics are inane. This perhaps reveals to me why I always had a limited interest in Blur."
5,"An oustanding resource for ""Thinking People of Faith"".","I really found this book to be thought provoking and insightful. I respect the author's bravery to ask and answer the questions we have all pondered, or been afraid to ask out of embarassment. I found the book hard to put down. When I finally did, I took a while to let it sink in and it encouraged me, and helped to strengthen my own faith. The chapter entitled:""Why does God allow so much pain & suffering?"". Wow! Batter, step up to the plate! No triviality here. His words speak truth clearly, and give purpose to my mind's wanderings. I have been a Christian for 25 years, and I found this book has helped to peel back the scales over my eyes and my faith, and opened them to see and understand why I believe. Not just simply feel the truth, but know it to be true. Kuddos to you Jim! God bless you."
2,A Weak Brew,"I must admit that I did not read this book all the way through, but selected a few sections, e.g., the reliability of the Scriptures. For that reason, I will give it 2 stars, but if the rest of the book was like what I read, I would lower that to 1 star. I have been an Evangelical Christian for over 20 years, yet I find much popular apologetics on Christianity to be disappointing and sometimes even dishonest. What I read in this book was definitely disappointing. It might confirm and affirm the beliefs of believers, but I do not see it being of much use at all for answering those who want real and in-depth answers to real and in-depth questions."
4,Excellent practical introduction to game theory,"This book provides a very good introduction to game theory from a practical, application-oriented point of view. Readers who expect a thorough mathematical introduction should read other books (e.g. Fudenberg&Tirole). But readers who want to understand the essence of game theoretical thinking and want to learn about many real-life applications (e.g. cold war) will like this book."
2,bad book.....,"The author is a fine economist, but he's written a lousy textbook. The only positive is that it's easy (indeed, almost to the point of being simplistic) so the uninitiated can learn from it rather readily. But it takes away any positive it provides by being rather nonstandard in its terminology and notations. Plus, I doubt anyone taking a college-level game theory class would be so untrained so as to need this sort of babying. Finally, the contents don't justify the sky-high price.If you need a good game theory text, buy Gintis for the intro. students and Osborne and Rubinstein for the reasonably advanced. These are affordable paperbacks that I think are as good as any hardcover. Don't waste money needlessly."
5,[...] use promo code CC127573,"I used this book in my senior seminar class Game Theory. It was very helpful, especially the solved exercises at the end of each chapter, however don't make the same mistake I made in purchasing it. check out [...]to rent and sell your textbooks. when you do, be sure to use the Promo code CC127573 when you rent for an extra 5% off already great savings. OR if you're looking to make a quick buck try selling your old textbooks. Use the same code and receive an additional $5 on your sale!"
5,Beyond your usual book,"Before I opened up my amazon package yesterday and laid my eyes upon this book, it had been a while since I had held such a well made and beauftifully put together piece. Not having looked at its dimensions before purchasing, I was impressed by the book's size. There are images on almost every page, and they are extremely detailed and vivid. In my experience, this is one of the nicest astrophotography books on the market. A true treasure."
3,Average,"Yes, this seems to be an average year. 1999's edition was much better. In fact, I think the best story in the book was the introduction by Amy Tan! Doctorow's intro this year was pretty lame.If you're looking for something more exciting, grab the Best New American Voices 2000."
4,Warning: VERY CATCHY ALBUM!!,"This is a wonderful record indeed. What a find!! It's unfortunate so few people know who these folks are. I must say, though, that this album is extremely catchy, and will have you bopping your head and singing along in no time. Seriously folks, ask questions later and just get your paws on this record. If there is a guitar pop heaven, I think the Gladhands might be fighting Sloan for the title of Supreme Being...."
5,"Fabulous, Educational, Fun!!","I purchased this video for my niece and nephew. They LOVED it! My brother told me that they love to watch Whoops and Bubbs and in addition to being entertained they actually learn something. Also my brothers friend, a teacher, is going to buy it for his classroom because he thinks its a great educational tool. I am very pleased with my purchase."
2,Has Done Better,"I read her other book, Breaking Down The Wall of Silence, and enjoyed it. However, I really had to skim this book. It reminded me of the readings I had to do in college. It was not fun to read, it got too technical for me!"
1,Krups leaky blender,"I spent 49.00 for a machine (XL6)that leaks all over my counter. They use a cheap plastic sealer ring that doesnt seal and once you make ice in it , you better have it on a towel because your counter will have as much on it as the blender has in it. The seal ring is not damaged , its just a bad design. I wish I could send it back or get the company to replace it but it doesnt look like that is going to happen. If you need a blender , dont buy this one."
1,Krups 34413-42,"Returned this blender. It is too noisy and did not meet my expectations. The Krups I had had was QUIET, multi-speed, and professional looking. This blender isn't worth the money, even at its reduced price."
1,Bad Product!!!,"Hi,I bought this product after looking at its specifications with 14 different speeds, ice crushing capability etc etc. There was not a single review to know how the grinder works or something, so I guess probably nobody had bought it. The 14 speed dial does not change the speed at all, it is low and high that's it. There was a some kind of metallic part that had come off or something and I could hear it hit the sides of the grinder when I shook the base portion of the grinder. I called the manufacturer and told them about this and their answer was, as long as the grinder works, that should not be a problem. The first time I used, I just made some apple milk shake and the grinder started smelling, like something burning inside. I did not want to use it any further and I returned it. Not a good product."
2,Krups Power XL6 - white base,The bachelor son passed it on to us saying it spewed all over his counter. The blender definitely has something rattling around in the motorized base. Since I have no directions/manual could someone tell me if the glass jar can be released from the plastic portion at the bottom for cleaning? (This is the square bottom which fits onto the motor.) We haven't given up on it yet.Thanks.
5,one great hypnotic groove,"Othar Turner, if you were lucky to ever seem him perform, was an amazing performer and a gentleman to boot. The full energy of one of his famous annual summer goat fryups at his home in Senatobia, Missisipi is captured here. The nearest muscial form to ""drum and fife"" comes from the west coast of Africa, that's how old this musical form is, although there is some blues guitar mixed in on some of the tracks. The fife gives a very primordial, birdcalling edge to the drums. ""Drum and fife"" is an acquired taste, but like eating spices, once you've acquired that taste, you cannot get enough. Although Othar died last year, apparantly his granddaughter will keep the tradition alive."
4,Interesting Overview of the Field of Mathematics,"""Essential Atlas of Mathematics"" covers a great deal of ground in approximately 100 pages. Divided into topical areas, the book makes heavy use of illustrations and examples to cover broad areas of the field of mathematics.While many of the photographs used in the book appear quite dated, the composition of the book facilitates generally easy reading. Various sections of the book may prove more challenging than others to some readers, but this book really does work well as an atlas...to be consulted as needed.For those readers with an interest in how many of the big areas of mathematics fit together, this is a book worth reading."
5,Best bits for pilot holes in treated lumber,I have had a problem drilling pilot holes for deck screws in treated lumber. The bits clogged and the hole had to be redrilled several times to accomplish the depth needed. These bits work better than any of the others I have used and last and last. I have used these for over 2 years in heavy construction (5 houses) and they are still working without any strain on the drill. Highly recommed using these bits in wood.
3,Interesting.....,"This is a unique retelling of Little Red Riding Hood where a young girl is left alone with her younger brother while her mother takes supplies to her ailing grandmother. Late that night a bear arrives. Not being as naive as the traditional Red, Gold Flower is not fooled. The young girl defeats The Bear by herself which is a wonderful break from the original story. Written a while ago, the book might reflect political the animosity between China (gold Flower) and Russia (The Bear) which would better explain the violence of the final scene. Revisiting it now I can more fully appreciate it, but as a young child I found the illustrations to be troubling and exceptionally creepy.For the history alone though, it is an interesting read."
3,needs improvements.....,"The grey one is easy to loose track of in the bottom of a tool bag or inside a box, etc. the color doesn't stand out among the rest of the clutter on a job site. The red and yellow work fine. I suggest that they change the color of the grey one to bright blue for example.I have also noticed that the points are getting dull on my set........and I only use them occasionally. So instead of using the next smaller nail set to tap a nail head down, I have to use the size larger than the nail head to ensure that the tip doesn't slide off the nail and create a larger hole to patch. Perhaps they are not using as high a quality of steel or heat treatment as they need to for this specific application."
5,a basic set but works great,these sets work great and function well. It is hard to screw up a set of nail sets. these are just fine.
5,"nice and grippy, color coded, squared not to roll off bench","I got these on a lark since I didn't want to keep pounding hammer prints into my birdhouses. They are nice and sturdy feeling, easy to hold onto, and poked the nail in like I wanted. I additionally added a S, M, and L to one of the squared off sides so I could remember what color I needed. Maybe that will help me remember what color is what since I store them in a pencil cup and can't see the point size at a glance. I really like that the hammering end is square so it won't roll around the workbench when I'm not using it. I would have liked another size like another set offered on Amazon, but those were lacking the grippy coating. So far these have worked great."
5,Nice,I have been using these for a few months and I love them. Easy to grip and manuever. Then again its a pretty simple tool.
5,They should make them all like this,"Standard nail sets are uncoated steel, which is prone to rust, slippery to hold, and difficult to determine the size.It is surprising to me that a simple, color-coded rubber coating is all it took to fix every one of these issues with standard nail sets. I'll even add another advantage: the bright colors make them easy to spot in the bottom of a toolbox, where they inevitably land.This is such an innovation, that I really think all nail sets should be made this way.Highly recommended."
4,Decent set of nail sets,"These worked pretty well, but I wish that there was a square ended nail set that was around the size of the nail heads that my pnuematic finish nailer shoots."
3,Use caution,"If you are observing kashrut (especially if you are newly observant)-- check your ingredient lists carefully, and DO NOT take the book's advice on kosher fish. The author lists 'eels' as kosher, however, EELS are TREIF!!This cookbook was written for a wider audience than kosher cooks, so check everything carefully. (The author, raised on a small Scottish isle, may use some foods as kosher that the larger Jewish community does not.)"
5,Fast efficient service.,I received fast and efficent service and appreciated the follow up to my address as I live in a hard to find area. I would use the service again!
1,Lid failure,"After several months, the lid failed to open properly. A few months after that, the small and poorly-designed lid hinges broke off completely."
4,I use this book as a text for my class!!,I teach Criminal Justice courses on the college level. In my Domestic Violence class I use this book. I find that it gives a clear picture of men who batter. I like the tables and charts as they aid understanding. Gondolf also offers hope that these men can heal and be nonviolent in future relationships. I'd like to see a new edition as the book was published in 1985 and there is so much more information and research since then. The current laws are much different than they were in 1985. Overall a good source of information.
5,A must have classic Black Metal from Greece,"This album was released back in 1989, when Scandinavian and American Black Metal stage just was getting born... It has very different feel. It's fast. It's melodic. It's dark and sad. Really good and original sound. I rate Rotting Christ right there with Dimmu Borgir, Emperor, Satyricon, Old Man's Child and Arcturus."
1,Not the original recordings,"These recordings are with a vocal backup, not the originals. One of the best things about Hank Snow's records was his band(the Rainbow Ranch Boys) They are not heard on this album.Get the RCA cd's"
3,Worth your time.,"A good gift for Chrebet fans. And by the way, the reviewer who said his Jet teammates were asking him about Hofstra being a ""girls school"" was off the mark. That happened to former Jet and Hofstra alum John Schmitt back in the 1960s. For my full review of the book, please visit hofstra.rivals.com"
3,reads like memoirs,"Wayne is a little too nice in this book, constantly thanking his friends and family, complimenting other players and coaches.... He isn't negative about anyone, and this is frustrating because you want to hear the dirt about the Jets and you won't get it here. Still a good, quick read. I don't think it would be a good book for non-football fans; he goes through too much detail about catching passes and specific Jets games. (that is, after he's done chronicling the contributions of his high school basketball coach) It's really a very good book, but you do have to sieve through the thank-yous a little bit. Also it's written after the 98 season, so who knows how positive he is now, after the last two years?"
4,Great movie,Oh my goodness...excellent movie...I know amazon needs 20 words...but the only thing I can say is this is an excellent movie...don't know how I missed this in theatres. All three main characters stories are excellent!
2,Free;okay. Purchase; hell no.,"If you were to walk over to me and ask,"" Would ya recommend buying this film?"" I'd honestly say,""no."" Its more of a film you'd just happen to watch on late night tv. You know, on a night ya over consumed too much chili, and can't sleep due to gas or heartburn...so you turn on tv and wait for the bitter end? There's better films to actually purchase, and this ain't one of them."
2,Poor recreation of an old favorite,"I was extremely disappointed in what I received. It looked like someone had gone through and tried to salvage what should have been an excellent recreation of an old favorite. But when they glued the insides to the cover, they did it upside down and backwards so the front cover opens not only to the back of the book but also to an upside down version. One would think that whomever sold this would have looked at what they were selling."
3,Unexpected Color,"From the stock photo I believed this item would be ""computer beige"" in color, but when it arrived it turned out to be ""institutional green"", almost olive drab. I have uploaded some photos to demonstrate. As far as function, it seems to work fine. I am using it to switch the output of two PC's to one monitor."
3,switch box,"This switch box works fine for switching between monitors. Though, it does not handle changes in resolution all that well. There was a lot of initial frustration before I figured out a configuration that worked."
1,nothing remotely useful here,"gottlieb obviously has never grown anything, and has just collected a lot of lore and anectdotes here. if you are really interested in growing, don't waste your money on this book."
1,The heavenly art of mix this house session ...,"Mark Doyle is making history each and every house compilations ,but this one is unique.The titles , the rythm , the perfect and clean mixes in each cd from this triple colection makes this album one of the must important releases of this year.Just listen , dance and enjoy this fine mixing job , as always Ibuy a new compilation from Hed kandi.If you love fine music and know about this movement I recomend buy it.Tree cd's with 3 diferents ambients , the first one for a sunny day , the send one for good quantity of nice house and the thirdfor the wild moments.So go ahead and keep on dancing from the very beguining of 2004.Have it and dance it !Congratulations Mark you do it again ..."
3,2 out of 3 good discs isn't bad,"I've had this album for almost 2 years and still cannot stop listening to the beach house set (CD 1). Very sexy vocals, and relaxing soulful beats - great for poolside listening and making a weekend afternoon in the summer into a mini vacation. I give that CD on its own 5 stars.Disc 2 is OK - I still listen to it occasionally, but use it mostly for pumping me up while I'm working out. Some songs are good (#7) but others are overplayed - e.g. I was never a big fan of Martin Solving and his 'Rockin' Music' in the first place.Disc 3 I barely ever listen to, and have probably only endured it in it's entirety about 4-5 times. One song sounds like the next and it's basically just boring, unoriginal dark house that I could have done without in the first place, but perhaps it's just personal preference - I'm not a trance or dark house head. 'Back to the island' is my favorite on this CD and earned it the 1 star I would give it."
4,Deficiencies,"Overall, it's a fine system, and I'm glad I bought it.However there are some astonishing design blunders:1. On some of the plunge bases, the depth indicator is made of translucent plastic instead of transparent. This makes it impossible to read the depth indicator.2. The spindle lock actuator on the plunge base is completely disfunctional. The motor unit cannot be brought down far enough to engage it.3. With the dust shield in place, it's impossible to make above-the-table bit changes. Worse yet, with large bits, the entire unit must be removed from the table to change bits. Without the dust shield, above-the-table bit changes are quite easy; but you get a lot of dust sprayed around."
3,disappointed,"The 890 router is a fine, quiet machine. However, the grip-vac and plunge bases leave a lot to be desired. I have only found one type of router operation in which the dust removal functions adequately-template routing of dishes. All other operations, free hand or on a table less than 10% of chips and dust are removed. Additionally, the dust port on the plunge base is too small for any vacuum hose/fitting I can findand I finally rigged a dodge 318 bypass hose to facilitate connection to my shopvac. Since dust and chip management were my primary for selection of the 890, I am very unhappy with this purchase. Yard sale bound. Maybe I should have waited for the arrival of the new MLCS"
2,Faulty plunge mechanism,"I have several Porter Cable routers, and they have been reliable and well built tools. That is why I chose this when I was looking for a lighter plunger router. The router is fine when in the fixed base, but the plunge base is a different story. There is quite a bit of slop in the plunge bushings which allow the router to angle from side to side as it is plunged, and it invariably binds in the process of plunging which forces you to rock it back and forth to complete the plunge. It is essentially useless for precision work. I had originally purchased it for exactly that; as a plunge router for use with guides on templates. The plunge base is now just a useless relic, and it is suitable for use with the fixed base only. If you're looking for a medium sized plunge router, look elsewhere."
2,Cheap and shows,"I got mine from another site, but these bags are all the same. The straps are bad, just some padding on nylon straps. A lot of the molle section on mine are differently spaced, some large, others too small to attach a molle bag to. I would have liked to see another molle strip on the side of the bag, so there would 3 instead of the 2 it has. On the plus side the inside storge it pretty good. Overall not a bad bad, but could be better."
1,why no negtive number?,Do we call this a book? pure garbage. It's more like a technical report from a failed graduate.wasted my time carrying it from the library and returning it.
2,Great to watch if you're on drugs!,"My husband bought this DVD for me, thinking it was live performances. Well, when we started watching it I decided the graphics were probably meant for people who are high at a party. Don't get me wrong, the music is fine, but to watch a lot of the videos made me dizzy. I love U2 and have for 20 years. But come on, this DVD should have a warning sign on it! Don't view if you're sober or conservative."
4,I can't believe it,"U2 is my altime favorite band, but looking at the tracklist, I think they could have done a much better job with the song selection. My personal fav U2 song is who's gonna ride your wild horses, which was a top 40 hit and was played a lot on the radio and isn't on this disc! Walk on, the title track of their last disc isn't on it either, another single and one of the best songs on their last CD. Yet The first time and Until the end of the world is on this cd, 2 non singles that i don't think would have been missed. Even the double CD doesn't include these songs. This is U2, one of the greatest bands of all time in my opinion, so yes this is a good cd, but they could of done a better job at a best of compilation for the 90's!"
4,Awesome! But a few things missing.,"I have been a longtime U2 fan for years and they are one of the most dynamic rock bands of our time. I thought that the tracklisting was pretty good for the 90-00 part of the set, except where is ""The Fly""? For them to include ""Numb"" doesn't make much sense unless you figure that since ""Edge"" wrote and performed it, maybe it was just a thumbs up to him. ""Please"" off the ""PoP"" album should've been included as well, I won't go on into the rest that were absently left out, but all in all it's still a U2 album and it is a ""Greatest Hits"" compilation so opinions no doubt will differ with every fan and listener. The remixes don't take anything away from the music which in the past has happened. It's worth the 20 bucks I paid for it, especially with the B-sides and the little DVD that are included, I give 4 and a half stars."
3,"The ""Bonus DVD"" is a deception","The selection of the musics for the double cd is excellent (as it is usually the case for such a set), but I regret paying the extra money for the DVD, which contains only 17 minutes in 4 tracks: 2 remixes with scenes from their concerts and video clips and ONLY 2 musics performances (""Please"" and ""Beautiful Day"").I would buy only the (cheaper)double CD, without the DVD."
5,U2 has yet to let down fans,U2 has again done it for their fans. I wasn't much of a fan until ATYCLB came out and then I went back and purchased all of their older stuff. I was happy that I spent the money on this album. The new mixes and the few new songs added to the album are a pleasure. Im just sorry that I waited until my late 20's to finally give their music a chance. Pushing 30 in a few weeks with this awesome band to listen to may make the next decade entertaining. I can't think of a better band and CD to expose my children to. Keep up the great music U2!!!! =-) You won't regret buying this album so please go purchase it!
2,I love U2 but this is a disgrace,"The tracks U2 picked for this record don't represent their musical explorations that they took throughout the 1990's.U2 have ""reworked"" all the tracks represented from ""POP"" into stripped down 2002 versions. All of the tracks from ""POP"" have been watered down and stripped to sound like stuff from their last record 'All that you can't leave behind"". It seems as if U2 are embarressed of their explorations into disco and dance music instead of representing it for what it was. Once 'Discotheque' used to sound like a disco song...now the reworked version sounds like a rock song about a disco. Everything is really messed up on these versions. If you only like U2 a little bit and want a weak representation of their 90's work, this is a good record for you. If you already have their albums from the 90's...don't buy this one, you'll only be disappointed."
2,Bad taste in my mouth!,"Like the lyrics from ONE.... ""or leave a bad taste in your mouth"". This it's not a Best of... This is not a compilation for U2 fans (they know better, right?) ...The good... it's U2......the 2 new songs: The hands that built America and Electrical Storm and... that's it.The bad... how can you not include The Fly or Lemon in a Best of, instead they put The first Time (¿best?)... HMMMThe b-sides.... It's a Club oriented compilation.... a lot of remixes (not the best option since many of the original songs are better: Salomé, Lady with the spinning head...And where is Holy Joe, Night and day, Paint it Black, Where did it all go wrong, Fortunate song, Sattelite of Love, Slow dancing, and The Fly (Lounge fly mix).Anyway...if you're a casual buyer... it's OKBut if you're a fan (a real one) who already have all the CD's .... don't waste youy money there's it's nothing here for you."
2,Definitely NOT the BEST OF....,"Disappointing!! That's the word to describe after the long wait of this much publicised album all over the music stores!! After the exhilirating 'ALL THAT YOU...' and the 'BOSTON CONCERT DVD', this compilation leaves much to be desired from the band that I've followed since my teenage days 18 yrs ago. Call me old-fashioned but U2's experimental 'DISCOTHEQUE' and 'POP' was disgusting to the loyal,original U2 fans! Disheartened I was but I was 'ELEVATED' when 'ALL THAT YOU..' was released and I said to myself,""Yes! U2 is back for good!!"" 'ELECTRICAL STORM' is fantastic, and what we need is a new album of this sort. To Bono and co, forget about compilation(no doubt 'BEST OF 80-90' gets the thumbs up),you guys are the best song and music writers and nothing is greater than the production of a new album(not a new image again,please..)for the sake of the all-time, loyal U2 fans all around the world! Have a 'BEAUTIFUL DAY' and 'WALK ON...'"
3,"Some GOOD cuts, some QUESTIONABLE...","I both agree and disagree with the choices for cuts on this album. However, I would in no way consider this a 'BEST OF' from the last decade. Three of my favorite cuts are not even present and they are GREAT U2 songs. The songs ""Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses"" from Achtung Baby, ""Please"" from Pop, and the truly beautiful ""Kite"" from All That You Can't Leave Behind. I DO agree with the inclusion of cuts like ""Stay (Far Away, So Close)"", ""Gone"", ""Beautiful Day"", ""Until The End of the World"", ""Staring At The Sun"", ""One"", and ""Miss Sarejevo"". I think the new songs ""Hands That Built America"" and ""Electrical Storm"" are decent too. However, choices like ""Numb"", ""The First Time"", ""Discotheque"", ""Hold Me..."" could have been replaced with something possibly better like the above mentioned ideas. That is why I feel this is a mix of both good and bad choices, in no way representational of their 'best'."
3,Solid,"Unlike many greatest hits packages that are really hyped, thisboth delivers but does not really make you say 'WOW!'. I foundthe first collection to be similar. This is really too bad as this is a band that is legendary for producing a large amount of during a particular album session that does not get released or ends up a B-side.The DVD is nice extra, but is the least that can be added considering how overpriced the cd is. After all, total costsfor this package are around 3 or 4 bucks."
4,"OK, but...","The 4 star review accounts for all the great songs in this collection. However, there is a full one star discount for not including ""The Fly"". What were they thinking of? The Fly was the song that blew the decade open and made everyone turn their heads in disbelief of the new, (perhaps) improved U2. Shame!This collection would have worked much better as a chronologically sequenced 2 disc set with ALL the truly best of, plus a limited b-sides bonus disc instead of the lame DVD. However, it is a necessary addition to any true U2 fan's collection. For newcomers (although at this point it would probably be hard to find any), get the albums, beginning with Achtung, Baby!"
1,BIG DISAPOINTMENT,"I want to let you know U2 is one of my favorite bands. However, this new ""greatest hits"" compilation is a very big disapointment. Instead of the ""A-side"" songs we love (and expected) from the past 10 years, this ""best of"" album contains nothing but badly done techno-type remixes. The two new songs ""Electrical Storm"" and ""The Hands That Built America"" arent worth listening to either. I recommend just buying the albums ""Achtung Baby"" and ""All That You Cant Leave Behind"" instead of this one."
1,DVD an insult to pay a premium for,"I bought this mainly for the so-called ""generous"" DVD material, after thoroughly enjoying the Elevation Tour Live in Boston so much...well, this issue is a waste of the extra money and material, since it only contains 2 videos and only ~3 second snippets of all the other ""extra"" features so highly touted in Amazon.com laudatory MATERIALLY MIS-LEADING if not DELIBERATELY LYING review...wherever the ""The bonus DVD contains a generous collection of videos of songs from disc one, along with alternate versions, director commentaries, additional bonus tracks such as ""If God Will Send His Angels"" and ""Lemon,"" as well as a mini-documentary of the band's historic 1997 Bosnian concert, The Road to Sarajevo"" is, its not on mine!!! and read the other customer reviews panning the CD of the B-sides, I probably won't even bother listening to it before I return mine to Amazon.comfor credit.The company that issued this skimpy package is doing a great dis-service to U2's fans."
3,A BIT DISAPPOINTED!,"I RECEIVED THIS CD AS A GIFT AND WHEN I SEEN IT, I THOUGHT THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT! AS I LISTENED TO IT AND LOOKED AT THE SELECTIONS THAT WERE ON IT, I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED WITH HOW MANY GREAT SONGS WERE LEFT OFF IT. U2 IS A GREAT BAND AND I THINK IT COULD OF BEEN BETTER."
4,Interesting choice of material from the 1990s...,"U2 obviously had a lot less to choose from in terms of popular songs when making this Best of than they did with the Best of 1980-1990. Fewer songs were radio hits, and some of the music was downright despised. The band, however, has made a smart, eclectic mix of music from a strange time in its history. The second CD, rather than just straight B-sides, contains numerous remixes that at times better the original songs. There's some strangely missing tracks, like ""Elevation"" from ""All That You Can't Leave Behind"", but overall, this compilation is quite satisfying for the U2 fan."
1,What happen to the DVD content?,I gave the CD/DVD 1 star based on the misleading DVD content.Where are all the videos and live concert material. Did I get the correct version of the DVD?
5,Noone could do this better than them,"U2 could do this better, but noone could do this better than U2. It is a whole new experience to listen to this collection - quite different than just give an ear to this and that song from this and that album.I think that the remixes /the so-called B-sides/ on the 2nd CD are much more interesting. It is like discovering some new stars in the well-known U2-universe...The DVD promo is quite disappointing, I have to confess.But anyway, this is the best 'Best of' album of the decade."
1,Extremely Dissapointing!!!,"I am an avid U2 fan, I have all their albums, so ANY Greatest hits collection would be a waste for me, but with 2 new songs on this I went out to buy it. It has new versions of a couple songs. I think this collection is put together knowing that real fans would buy it for the B sides, but the songs chosen don't really show the greatness of the 90's U2.The first Best of was better."
4,Almost another decade for this release!,"This second..and up to date instalment of U2's greatest hits has atlast arrived. The first disc containing 16 hit songs which have the recent ""Beautiful Day"" and ""Electrical Storm"" makes this compilation complete. This set also comes with a second disc with all the B side tracks which include remixes of songs from the first disc and a version of ""Happiness Is A Warm Gun"" by The Beatles. This limited edition also offers a free DVD containing 4 short films including a live performance of ""PLease"" filmed in 1997. My only let down on this set is the song ""Lemon"" is not among the 16 songs on the greatest hits but is on the B sides disc as a 5.29 jeep mix version. Besides that this is a must have for all U2 fans and anyone who owns the first greatest hits compilation."
5,The best? I don't know. Great? certainly!,"This package presents an excellent overview of the band's imput during last decade. As usual, there are great songs that were left out, but the selection is pretty solid and the remixed tracks (on disc 1) really stand over the originals. The second disc has interesting stuff, but more fore die hard fans than regular listeners. Anyway, great album"
2,Don't Buy it for the DVD,"The description leads one to believe there are quite a few of the videos collected on the enclosed DVD. The DVD includes a TRAILER for for a DVD with the videos along with about 3 ""videos"". The B-sides are great, but don't but it for the DVD!"
2,Don't But it for the DVD,"The description leads one to believe there are quite a few of the videos collected on the enclosed DVD. The DVD includes a TRAILER for for a DVD with the videos along with about 3 ""videos"". The B-sides are great, but don't but it for the DVD!!"
1,Don't buy for the DVD!,...the DVD has no videos from disc one or anything else.It is a cheap promotional DVD!
2,Disappointed,"Like many others who listened to this CD set, I too was very disappointed with the mixed bag collection of U2 songs and its remix! It certainly does not have all the best of U2 between 90-2000. Amazon has been crafty not to provide enough description on the product description. Nevertheless, I should have done my due diligence by listening to every sample provided at the end of the page.Bottom line - listen to the album sample before buying!"
5,A nice collection.,A phenomenal cd from one of the best bands around. Their best cd is still the Joshua Tree but this hits collection does a good job of picking the right songs. Spurge for the double disc. The B-sides are worth it.
3,Not the must have of the first,"There are few songs on the B-side album or new material on the primary disc that warrants getting this CD. Of course, if you are a fan and a collector, go for it. Otherwise, don't waste your money, you probably already have these in your collection."
5,New Versions of Gone and Discotheque,"The best part of the album is the New Versions of Gone and Discotheque. They are stripped down, resemble more like the live versions and very refreshing. (For example, I love hearing the cow bell tapping loud and clear in the new version of Gone.)Sorry, if you like the overworked, distorted POP versions, then you won't agree with me.These 2 songs are much improved! This album is worth just to hear this."
3,The 80's were better for U2,"Basically, after listening to the this CD, I really wanted to go listen to the FIRST ""Best Of"" CD! The 90's were not particularly kind to the band, the energy and angst they once had was replaced by boring remixes (use a DJ scratching records, at least), programming, and over-thinking their craft. Will they ever make another gem like ""A Sort of Homecoming?"" Um, no."
2,"Shipped fast, quality poor","These Coverking floormats came quickly. But they do NOT have the precut holes as shown on the picture. There is no way to hold them in place, so they slip around a lot. Bad deal."
1,"OMG, this pen is the WORST!!!","I bought the Sheaffer fine point Viewpoint Calligraphy Pen two days ago. I have had a problem with this pen flooding, blotting and leaking from the first time I attempted to use it. There are ink stains on my desk, my arms, six out of ten fingers and most likely my nose or mouth (as I've probably absent mindedly scratched at an itch). Not little ink dots, either. It looks as if a clumsy cop attempted to finger print me. I'd love to sit and write more about this pen, but I have to go wash my hands--AGAIN."
2,fairly disappointed,"This pen has a flow problem. It will write for maybe half a page, and then no amount of shaking and pleading will make the ink come out. The barrel cut-out to see the ink cartridge is pretty cool, however I agree with the other commenters that the cut-out edges are needlessly sharp. I would not buy this pen again."
2,Bad Ink Flow And Flooding,This Pen is Not Good. This Was My Very First Fountain Pen And iWas Very Very Disappointed With How The Pen Has A Problem With The Ink Flow And You Are Planing To Buy This Pen I Wouldn't Recommend It To Any Body.
5,"no problems, yet...","I have owned one of these for some months and have yet to experience any undesirable effects. My hands are large, though."
1,Number of cables deceiving,"The image shows 5 cables and the product is called ""Cables to Go"" (plural). This indicates to me I would be buying 5 cables, right? WRONG! This is only 1 cable. I looked through the description and the technical details, but nothing confirms this product is only a single cable.I thought I was getting a great deal for five cables, but for only 1, it's not such a great deal. Deceptive imagery. Beware."
5,Go to Cables to Go for a great product for the price,"Again, Cables to go has provided an excellent product with a fantastic price. I had purchased a second computer and have both computers in a smaller roo. Unfortunately, the first computer was not wireless network ready, so I had to get a wired router. Not wanting to spend a ton more for cables at a big box store I turned to Amazon to find Cables to go with a great price once again. I had purchased HDMI cables from them previously and they haven't failed my expectations. They work great. I definitely will purchase more cables if needed from Cables to Go."
3,Weapon cleaning kit,Not as good quality as I had hoped. Good storage case and quite an assortment of items.
4,lots of fun!,"Recently I have been rereading some of the Sammy Keyes novels that I remembered enjoying. I remembered this one being great and was not disappointed! This is a fun and intriguing mystery that will keep you guessing until the end. However, there are clues that are dropped for the reader throughout the whole book so that the conclusion really feels like a bit of detective work done by Sammy, not just a magically appearing answer. As always, Sammy's narrative kept the book funny and captivating. I couldn't put it down until I finished it! Truthfully, though maybe the writing is not the best that can be found by any standards, I can't think of a thing that I did not enjoy about this book."
5,A great mystery series gets better!,"Okay, I LOVE young adult fiction and I love mysteries. So, having the two together is a dream come true. If you haven't heard of Sammy Keyes, you really need to pick up one of the books in the series and read it (preferably this title!). You'll be hooked. Sammy, a spunky 7th grader, doesn't take no for an answer and often lets her curiousness get her into trouble. Think of Nancy Drew with an attitude and high tops.This book, the newest in the series, was full of suspense, humor, and action. This one had me guessing until almost the very end. Also, mine came with a free cd, which had a short reading from another Sammy Keyes book, read by the author. Heck, that was worth the money. Also included were a couple of Sammy Keyes songs. If you love mysteries, grab a copy of this book. You'll be hooked on the series!"
5,Sammy on the mind,"This book has got it all - mystery, action, a red-headed enemy, a super cool grandma and of course a couple of cute guys. Written from the point of veiw of one sassy seventh grader these books are really fun to read. I really liked this book because it was funny the way Sammy told it and it had just the right mix of every thing. Sammy Keyes will have you laughing out loud. Seventh grade girls will really love this book because they can see things from Sammy's point of view. They will love the crazy situations that Sammy can get herself into, and they will groan as she battles the all evil Heather Acosta."
3,A complete cross section of Sentenced,"First off, I should give this 3 1/2 stars. I got this album having never listened to Sentenced before. I read about how they used to be a typical screaming death metal band back when they started but have progressed into some great new territory. I disagree with that. I actually like some of the old heavy stuff the most. ""Amok"" is probably their best album to date, though not as heavy as their oldest stuff. The newest stuff is so boring and mellow, it's not even the same band (it's amazing how many times I've said that about a band). So, I would recommend this album since there really isn't that much new, crappy Sentenced material on here. Get this for the old gems Sentence once played."
4,xena and the magic arrow of myx,"i seen this and thought oh boy another new xena book, it was very good, action packed, suspenceful and SHORT. that was the only disapointment not a novel, but a short story. that was the only reason i rated it 4, title is misleading. other than that it was worth the reading, and rereading, i would highly reconmend buying it. author did a great job and it keeps with the story line of the show."
1,A disappointing read,"The only part about this book I enjoyed was the plot - which of course is not original! I found the characters extremely shallow and unbelievable. The swaying of emotion from deep despair to unbelievable joy on a single page by a single character did not ring true to me. The character of Guenevere annoyed me because she was such a victim to her emotions, while paradoxically being so ""strong"" (as the author attempted to make us believe). I have read plenty of other books in this same ""style"" (eg. Diana Gabaldon's wonderful books) and this does not even come close."
1,this version of the Arthurian legends sets my teeth on edge.,"A few other reviewers went into great detail and said alot of things I have to agree with.I picked this book up as part of my resource and research materials for an Arthurian novel I'm in the process of writing, and the twists and turns and liberties she's taken with the traditional storyline just really bug me.If I wanted a pagan-heavy, feminist viewpointed version of the story, I'd reread Mists of Avalon. This was too heavy-handed and seems alot more like a romance novel than fantasy. Merlin was a twisted old man bent on revenge who hallucinated women and cackled..Guenevere was a pagan queen from a society that believed in polyamory and her right to change lovers/consorts every 7 years, and while Arthur did have the pendragon tattooos on his wrists (ties to the old ways) he followed the Christians.I just really couldn't stand the thing."
4,"Well, I liked it!","This is probably only the second or third Arthurian book that I have read, but I have to say that I did enjoy the story. While it might not be the best book I have ever read, it will be one that I will pick up and read again. I did like the fact that it wasn't plagued with unpronuncable names as the other books were."
2,"Rip off of The Mists of Avalon, with Guenevere as the hero","Marion Zimmer Bradley wrote The Mists of Avalon, a retelling of the King Arthur story from a feminist/wiccan viewpoint. This book makes Guenevere the heroic pagan woman, and she is not the compelling character that Morgaine was in MZB's book. The christian Gwenyfhyr in MZB's book and the conflict between the woman and their faiths is not matched in this book."
1,Couldn't Finish,"This novel tells the story of Guenevere and Arthur. I started with high hopes, but those were quickly dashed. I kept trying, but the going got slower and slower and finally stopped altogether.The two main characters didn't interest me a lot, and when they did catch my attention they only irritated me. Several of the side characters seemed like they had potential to be deeper and more satisfying, but the book didn't focus much on them. The main reason I didn't finish was that the romance aspect of the novel was too much for me. It distracted me from the storyline (which itself was interesting) and again, made the characters less likeable to me.On the bright side, I did find the story fascinating and this book prompted me to try more books that tell the story of Camelot."
2,Not the best retelling,"As a fan of the Arthurian legend, I picked this book to read another take on the legend of Camelot. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. This retelling centers around Guinevere, the Queen of the Summer Country, a strong willed individual who marries Arthur to help her people. I admired Guinevere for about the first third of the novel and then slowly I tired of her. Same went for Arthur. He was depicted as he always is, manipulated, romantic, and weak.I found myself struggling to finish this book and knew for sure at the end of the book that I wouldn't be reading the rest of the trilogy. Bottom line: avoid this retelling and go read The Mists of Avalon instead."
1,Disappointing,I had expected something spectacular to read here. But this book was very badly written. It was confusing and hard to follow. It jumped from character to character within a short paragraph. It was hard to keep track what the chapter was about. I haven't even finished the book yet and I'm already not looking forward to it. I usually love reading...but this book was a great disappointment.
2,Well....ummmm....yea....,"Well, i picked up this novel because i was intrigued to see Guenevere portrayed as a strong-minded young woman. And was only mildly disappointed. She was strong, but maybe i had built up her image so big that the character just couldnt reach.Ummmm, overall it was good. The flow lacked and occasionally i put the book down because i was bored with the repetitiveness of it all.Yea, i would recommend this novel, but only if you're on a long road trip or stuck in detention."
1,Very Disapointing,"I have a penchant for books about the Arthurian legend and really tried to like this one. But, it was such a harlequin romance barely disguised as historical/mythological novel that I couldn't stomach it. Just so smarmy! Read the Mists of Avalon instead: granted, Guenevere is not given much sympathy in that novel, but it's better than this..."
2,"Mildly amusing, but completely misrepresents Catholicism","I have always been intrigued by the Arthurian legends and thought that as a woman, I'd enjoy this book. Boy was I wrong! Guenevere was a whiny, self-centered woman, whom I would be ashamed to know. And I was sorely disappointed at the way the Catholic faith was misrepresented as a male-dominated cult."
2,A Story Already Told Before,"Guenevere has indeed been described before and a much stronger and three dimensional characters can be found in Marion Zimmer Bradley's 'The Mists of Avalon'. 'Queen of the Summer Country' has borrowed a lot of its strength from Zimmer Bradley's story (that by the way was written in 1982 - long before this book was written.) The characters are flat, un-explored, and as someone already pointed out: the constant repetition of 'Arthur oh Arthur' is an effective tool to drive readers insane, sigh! I will not buy the next book but might borrow it from the library - I do love Arthurian stories..."
1,"Poorly executed, I stopped reading","I've struggled through 150 pages and I'm giving up. I'm a huge fan of Arthurian versions, and this one falls flat and far short of other versions. It is a pale pale imitation of the Mists of Avalaon. It drags in Guenevere as a follower of the old religion (pre-christian), yet does a poor job (so far) of describing it. All the characters seem like villians, and Guenevere garners no sympathy. She spends most of her flushing with embarrasement!Much better stories are Marion Zimmer Bradley's Mists of Avalon, even if it isn't well written, I still care about the characters. Frank Whyte's Dream of Eagles series (8 books) gives a wonderful accounting of how Camalot grew into being, showing the co-existance of the old religions and how christianity came to the forefront. Its full of military battles that I prefer to skip over, but at least the battles make sense compared to this Guenevere tripe!I'm very disappointed that I wasted my money buying this Guenevere series."
5,THUMBS UP FOR GWEN BOOK!,This was a riveting read - I can't wait for the third book to be published!
5,I want to read the whole trilogy!,"Rosalind Miles has a wonderful, lyrical writing style that breathes new life into an old legend that's been told over and over again. Her characters, particularly Guenevere, are bold, adventurous and not at all cliched. I fell completely in love with Guenevere, who is a strong, sexy woman who lives the same heartache as many of us. I'm glad that Rosalind Miles finally rescued this wonderful character from the bad rap she's gotten in so many other tellings of the Arthurian legend. I will definitely read the other books in the trilogy!"
2,Recycled Legend,"Having read most of the feminist retellings of the Arthurian Legend, I have to admit that this was one of the most unimaginative versions to date. Aside from the preposterous notion of a matriarchal subkingdom within Arthur's Britain, there really isn't any original material within the 400 or so pages of this book. Guenevere is typically selfish and yet not quite as strong willed as she tends to be in other novels of this sort. The plot is just about as weak as the supporting characters, with the exception of Morgan Le Fay, whom I would have liked to see more of. Her background was fairly original following the outline of Le Morte D'Arthur where she is sent to convent, all in all a nice change. I would recomend this book only to those who have not sampled other literary offerings cut from the same mold."
2,There are better Gueniviere books out there...,"I've been reading Arthurian novels lately, and I looked forward to reading this book to get a different perspective on Guinevere. And it is interesting that a legend is interpreted in so many ways, and this book does present a few different aspects.But I couldn't get into it. I wasn't able to connect with the Guenevere character, despite her happiness and sadness. She tended to be a little whiny, and Arthur seemed like a bit of a dolt sometimes.However, the most annoying thing about this book for me, personally, was the use of exclamation points! It seemed whenever there was a quote, it used an exclamation point! I felt like the characters were yelling all the time! After a while it was almost funny!I'd say this book would be okay to pick up from the library but I wouldn't recommend buying it. There seem to be better Gueniviere books out there to read."
1,"Been There, Read This, Had Deja-Vu","I am almost convinced that this novel is a... in essence of The Mists of Avalon. The whole Christian versus Pagan thing rears its head again, and again almost to the point of being preachy. It seems the author thought Mists' Gwenyfhar got short-shifted and so decided to turn her Guenevere into the kind of character Morgaine was. Maybe this would be really good for someone unfamiliar with Mists. In reality, it doesn't come close to Mists, but the same ideas are present..."
1,Not worth your time.,"I wanted to read about Guinevere (I prefer this spelling) because I just loved her in First Knight. This book boasted of a strong heroine, one for all ages and so I was eager to read all about the Arthurian legends through her point of view. Unfortunately, the book turned out to be a big disappointment. The basics of the story had been twisted and told with little skill. Perhaps Guenevere would have been better without her redundant thoughts and complaints. Lancelot was NOT very likable at all. The antagonists, Malgaunt and Morgan, were pretty true. But I think that's about it, this isn't worth reading to me."
2,Sketchy,"This book was a fresh perspective of the Guenevere tale. However, it didn't really reach it's full potential in character portrayal."
2,Miles Has Done Better,"In the modern literature of the Arthurian legend the book rehabilitating the adultress High Queen has yet to be written. I very much enjoyed Rosalind Miles' ""I, Elizabeth"" and had high hopes for this volume. It might work as a juvenile, but everything about it is weak. Not one of the characters captures the imagination of the reader. I didn't hate it, but I did finish it constatntly hoping it would get better. I will not buy the second volume in this series. I might borrow it, but then only in the desperate hope that this effort by Ms. Miles was a fluke."
1,A Waste of Time,"I love Arthuriana and am always interested in any new take on the legend. I was happy to find this book at the library...until I started reading it. I wish I could give it zero stars, but Amazon doesn't allow that.Previous reviewers have already pointed out everything I found bad about the book (character inconsistencies, poor writing, etc.) I did finish the book (stupidly hoping beyond hope that it would improve) so I feel comfortable advising people looking for an entertaining read to avoid this. If you're interested in Guenevere I'd recommend Nancy McKenzie's ""Queen of Camelot"", Sharan Newman's series or Persia Woolley's trilogy. I would also recommend Helen Hollick's series for those looking for a telling devoid of magic."
1,Toyota Prius,Not what I thought it would be. Made to dash look really sloppy. First thing I have returned.
5,REQUIRED READING,"Guinness paints a very grim picture of the meagchurch's accoumadtions to modernity. In the face of rising hostility from mainstream culture nobody wants to face the fact that some of our greatest church ""successes"" are actually just as dangerous. This reality is not one Guinness relishes or is eager to report, but the story must be told. Very concise, well-written, well-researched, thoughtful. I wish every Christian in America could read thsi book. One of the ten most importnat things I have ever read."
1,Old arguments from an out of touch perspective.,"O.S. Guiness evidently does not understand the concept of form verses function. The function of the church never changes. The word of God never changes. The function of the church is to take the gospel of Christ to a lost world. The form we use must be relavant to the culture or the message will be rejected. If the church does not speak a language people can understand, people will not listen. This concept in no way implies compromising the truth or message of God's word. Mr. Guinness has a heart for God but a misunderstanding of this topic."
4,Great for damaged hair,"My stylist recommended these products for my hair. I love them! They really make my hair look and feel healthier. The shampoo doesn't lather up as well as I'd like so I use a little of my regular shampoo with it. Also, it tends to build up on your hair so every now and then I use a clarifying shampoo as well but this is well worth the healthier hair which we all know equals beautiful hair."
3,Not for kinky hair,"I had a hard time untangling my hair after using this product. But after I got past that, it smelled really good and made my hair shiny."
5,An excellent mass spectrometry reference,"The Expanding Role of Mass Spectrometry in Biotechnology is the book that the biotechnology field has needed for years. It accurately covers the basics yet illustrates the most advanced ideas of possible applications. ""The Expanding Role of MS ..."" describes the current major areas of mass spectrometry applications such as protein characterization, pharmacokinetics, and high throughput screening. With interesting examples, clear explanations, and major references, ""The Expanding Role of MS ..."" provides an excellent reference for academic and industrial needs. The format and the examples make this book the perfect teaching tool for students or scientists wanting to better understand the principles as well as the potential roles of mass spectrometry in biotechnology. I have recommended it for scientists within our company or anyone interested in the capabilities of modern mass spectrometry."
4,beginners Ayurveda,"I was interested in ayurveda because I had been feeling ill and conventional medicine had not worked. This book is designed for people who have just aquired an interest in Ayurveda and is perfect for that purpose. After you've found out which type you are; Fire, air or earth it goes on to explain in a basic easy to understand way; your Beauty, Dietry, Yoga and health requirements and also has a A-Z firstaid guide with natural relief to problems from dizziness to insomnia to menstrual cramps. Very useful"
4,Opened My Eyes to the World of Ayurveda!,"Simply Ayurveda was a very informative book which lays out the basics of the practice of Ayurveda. Bharti Vyas explains everything in detail, but also in a way that allows you to really understand and absorb all of the information. I enjoyed this book because it gives you simple suggestions that one can do everyday to improve his or her life. There are even a few recipes that one can try out to assure there is balance within the body.I would definitely suggest this book to someone who is interested in or is just beginning to learn about Ayurveda. It's a good foundation for an incredible practice!"
2,Collet failure,"I just called Porter Cable to report a failure of the collet with my new 8902 Router. A machining error in manufacture of the collet allowed it to throw the bit while cutting. Since it was mounted in a table with a guard, the only casualties were the bit and the guard.The nature of the error suggests a bad batch of collets. Examine them carefully.The base seems very fiddly to adjust accurately, but I intended to use this in a table, so this is not relevant.An added comment, They sent me a new collet after a few weeks."
2,Bad experience,"The reason I bought this router is that the first router that I bought from Porter Cable died about two weeks before the warranty ran out. However, because I could not prove to Porter Cable that the motor was bad they would not do anything about it. But, just as I expected, the motor went bad again and then the warranty was out. I bought a new unit, even though I was not happy with the first one. I don't think Porter Cable wants to make its customers happy. I would recommend another brand. They are the ones that caused me to write this review."
2,Router promises but does not deliver,"The Porter Cable 892 2-1/4 hp router fits easily up to my Bench Dog router table insert. Vertical adjustments are easy. The little pin that is supposed to lock the shaft to enable tightening and loosening the collet broke off in the first couple of months' use. I never got round to getting it fixed in warranty; just used two wrenches instead.Though the router has both 1/4 and 1/2 inch collets, it is not up to handling bits over about 2 inches diameter. I made raised-panel oak doors, which need a 3 inch bit. The router got very hot and began to smell of burnt insulation. It evidently has no high-temperature cutout, and eventually burnt out completely, in spite of giving it 5 to 10 minutes rest between doors. Now it is out of warranty, so I'm buying a different make and going up to 3-1/2 hp."
3,Close but no Cigar,"I have several Porter Cable routers along with an ELU. When this router is mounted under a table, it is wonderful that it will lift to a height where changing bits is a breeze. Also, the router has plenty of power when using large raised panel bits. Now for the bad. Porter Cable used a plastic gear system on the side of the router for the raising and lowering mechanism. When using the height adjusting feature, the gears are too course which doesn't allow for accurate fine adjustment. Also the adjustment is sloppy at best, the router tilts in its base, especially when a little sawdust falls into the adjusting mechanism. I actually have to reach under the table and pull the router vertical to insure accurate height adjustment. While the router motor is fine, there are better systems for mounting a router beneath the table. This router makes me thankful for Ebay."
2,Great ideas - poor execution,"When everything is working, this is a great router system. Too bad, it seldom works. I've owned the router for over a year and for 6 months of that time it has been in and out of the shop. Problems include broken motor lock mechanism, broken worm gear to raise motor and broken shaft lock. Last time, I bought extra gears and shaft lock pins just to keep it out of the shop. Any sawdust clogs the mechanism so raising and lowering are tough. I've had several other PC routers and have been extremely pleased with all of them, but this one has just about made me lose the faith."
2,Broke 2 levers before I turned it on for the first time,"Using the router under the table has been impossible, since I keep snapping the cheap spun aluminum levers PC has used. This especially happens when using a socket to manipulate the lever. Loosening the lever screw so that the lever won't break does not adequately secure the router. The router design is brilliant in terms of the mechanism, but the parts need to be rock solid and they are not. I am extremely dissapointed."
1,"Pitiful router, pitiful company","Had the router for a while but didn't use it much. Recently I was attempting a project when the shaft froze and blue sparks shot out. Took it to the repair shop and they said the bearings were shot and it would need a new armature for $141.00. Of course it was past the warranty, but still it was hardly used. I've heard from others for similar problems.I'm not buying Porter Cable cheese anymore, and you should think long and hard before you do too. Unless you like buying routers every other week."
1,Great Idea poor quality,I like all the features and a great motor. I have had it a year and 1/2 and use it only a couple times a month. The lift system has been broken 3 times. My last PC router
5,Great router,I think it's great. I got it 3 weeks ago and mounted it in my saw table. It is very easy to adjust from above the table and bit changes are easy with my drop in mount. It seems to have plenty of power even at lower speeds. I plan to purchase the plunge base to use with the same motor since the bases are so easy to change.
4,Solid Ring Better Suited 4 Scarf Than Finger,"Such a solid ring, but it's shape is actually square. This makes for discomfort on the finger, but it works beautifully with a scarf around the neck. Extremely well made and a pleasure to look at."
1,basically the worst video ever made!,"i can not believe that this is a real movie. i can not believe that lions gate would put their name on a joke like this. it is cheep and nothing went into. it is maybe worth a joke. 11 year olds with home video cameras have made better movies than this. the sound is off, the lighting sucks, the location is a crappy house and the actors act worse than soap stars. anyway, i just cant believe it... i feel like i have been punked.mandy"
1,Don't even bother,"Dude i rented this movie and I still feel ripped off the acting is terrible and the special effects look like they were done in photoshop, it mostly takes place in what to me looks like a costcos warehouse and the dude on the cover isn't even in the movie it stars sum out of shape dude runnin around armed with nothin but plastic daggers and bad acting its a miracle that this garbage was ever released DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!! unless your willing to laugh at how terrible this thing is."
1,This film is just a mess.,"I love cheesy movies, movies who are so bad that they are good, well this movie is just so bad that it is horrible. The acting is the worst I have ever seen, the special effects are pathetic, and the storyline is weak. The movie looks and feel like a home made YouTube project made by a few bored friends, and not the kind of YouTube film where passion and creativity go into doing the best with what one have, but more the kind where one is just board and messing around with a camera. I can not believe this movie got published.The plot of this movie is one man who desires to take down this powerful vampire leader, why he want to do that, it is in the badly written plot somewhere but I just could not force myself to care. As result there is allot of badly choreographed fighting and retarded one liners. Now some say this is a Blade ripoff, it is not, they might have tried to rip of Blade, but seriously, a Blade clone would be somewhat good, this film is just a mess."
1,THIS MOVIE SUCKS!!!,"Oh my God, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Low-budget vampire hunters who don't even use half the weapons portrayed on the cover. The vampire-killing scenes suck, as when a vampire is staked, lightning comes out of the body. Skip over this one for sure."
1,Vampire Assassins,"08/28/2008As of today (08/27/2008) I cannot start the DVD Tape. I received this DVD over two weeks ago. I have tried several times to start the DVD.Yours TrulyHarold E Garner6509 Kriel StreetBaltimore,Maryland 21207Harold.Garner@ssa.gov"
2,Disappointed,"Although I enjoyed some of the songs that Tommy is known for I found the sound quality of the recording poor. I tried it on several different cd players but it all came out the same, poor."
4,"One of the best 8 ""voices"" ever","The voice deserves 6 stars, the recording 3. The STEREO sound has a completely unbalanced mix, really it's 2 mono's. Many CD's of old recordings are remastered this way (fake stereo) don't know why. Leave them in mono if you can't do it in a proper way. It's a pity because the quality of the remastered sound is very good, not to say excellent specially considering the age. I must though say that you can really notice it listening with a pair of top quality headphones, through the speakers it's less evident and the STEREO front flows much smoother.The voice of TOMMY is of another Galaxy ours, deaf, has ignored it without even knowing it existed...another huge talent discovered only by few.This CD is absolutely a must have if you love wonderful music.Ciao,Franco"
3,Missing Songs,"It would be much better if they included every song from the movie, but they definitely did not. The first song in the opening credits is call No Sleep Tonight by The Faders. IF you search Yahoo Movies, you can find a list of every song used in the movie."
4,i know the song...,"the song playing when duke is helping her with her soccer is ""Love and Memories"" by O.A.R (of a revolution)...for those who were wondering"
3,what's that song??!!,hey does anyone know that song which came on when duke was helping viola with her soccer?? the one where viola woke up to have a shower... it started with 'zaga zaga...' or sth like that.. anyone who knows??
2,SONG FROM THE CARNIVAL,"hey im looking for the song that is playing when viola first arrives at the carnival...i just got home from seeing the movie and loved it, but couldnt find that song on the soundtrack...i've heard it before and i really want to find out wat it is....so if anyone can help me PLEASE thanks so much"
2,Question!!,Just wondering does anyone know what the first song played in the film was?? It was played at the very begining when they were on the beach playing. Thanks!!
3,Good... but whats missing?!,"The soundtrack IS missing a lot of key songs. The All-American Rejects ones are easy enough [Dirty Little Secret AND Move Along]... then there are some missing tunes from Goldfrapp [Oh la la] and the Faders [No Sleep Tonight].... but does anyone know what the song is that's playing while ""Sebastian"" is practicing his soccer skills with Duke's help.... i want to say he sings something about 'drowning' a lot in it? If anyone knows any of the other missing songs, PLEASE POST THEM!"
2,Another soccer montage song?,"Does anyone happen to know the upbeat song that takes place during a soccer scene? (it's not the O.A.R. song or the Montagne song) it sounds suspicously like Shaggy's music and the chorus is something like, 'zinga zang zang zang zingy zang' or something? Amanda dances & in the next scene has the entire team dancing & then she hilariously is dancing on the coach by accident. Anyway if anybody knows this song please post it for us. Thanks!"
2,Here is one missing song title...,"Ray LaMontagne Hold you in my arms, this is one of the songs that is missing i think that it is the one while he is practicing. It is a really good song and his album is fantastic.I was also really dissapointed with this soundtrack as i think there were so many other songs that should have been included."
3,The Faders,"The song at the begining is called ""No sleep tonight"" by the faders, but The song by Beenie man is not the same one, it starts the same but the beat and lyrics are different."
4,Overall a GREAT soundtrack,"Was expecting all songs in the movie to be in this CD and was somewhat disappointed; HOWEVER, the remaining songs are still GREAT!"
4,Hey sexy lady - by shaggy,"[[[[What is the name of this song?, April 19, 2006Reviewer: M.A.R.S ""MARS"" (Toronto, Ontario, CA) - See all my reviewsthe song that when Sebastian(Viola) ask Paul to help her to make her more popular, and when they appeared in the pizza bar, the song began when Viola appeared first, then when Kia started to appeared, someone began to sing"" oh, the sexy lady..."" what is the name of this song, is there anyone know it, please tell me, thanks]]]] well thats wat the song is called n who its by lol! x]"
3,song during the practice,"in the movie.. when duke and ""viola"" are practicing and the coach is looking at them from the stands.. what is the song that is playing? i've listened to the soundtrack but i don't think it's on there. thanks"
3,song during the practice,RhonAM the song you're looking for is called Love and Memories by O.A.R. I liked this song from the movie too but once I heard the whole song...i changed my mind.
2,hmmm...no,this has all the background music!! it doesn't have any of the actual SONGS. does anyone know what the song was that they played while sebastian(viola) and duke were on the soccer field just after the carnival thing?
3,not really manga,"the artsyle on the cover is Extremely Missleading~!It Will only show how to draw ""realistic"" style manga anatomy. The women model is also rather man-ish looking.So its not what i expected at all and i'm kind of Dissapointed. There is also a very Weird p2 page spread of up-crotch shots that i can only imagine are there for H-manga refrences."
5,ausome,i dont agree with the others. it was nude to show muscles on the body.i found this very usefull because it had alot of strange views and all the normal ones. ill never make my characters this buff though.lavadisk
1,Not a Manga-Style Instructional Book!,"This book will not teach you how to draw anime characters. Period.Despite the fact that the cover shows anime-style characters, and the very title includes the words ""How to Draw Manga,"" that's not what you get inside. Instead, you get tons of life-like drawings that don't resemble anime at all. Even the eyes shown inside don't resemble the eyes of the girl on the cover.I was extremely disappointed with this book."
3,I'm okay with it.,I got this book manily because I thought it give me some referance to my drawings for angles and foreshorting referance which to some point it dose just that only problem I had with was I never thought a human male was so muscular LOL. The women are fine but I would probaly draw the men at well build unless I was doing Thor the god of thunder or something. But it dose give me some ideas how some angles whould look so that not so bad. And the tip on how to handel a scene with more than one character interacting with each other was helpful.
3,Not a Manga Book,"At the time that I purchased the book, the reviews for it were very positive at many of the places I looked.... but it is very deceiving. I thought that this book would help me to draw manga?? But disappointingly it has little to do with manga, and it has few how to's, so the title is not very fitting.But, I did find that even though it is not in the manga style, it does show the body parts in great detail, and at different angles, which does in my opinion help with drawing in general. Which is why I gave this book 3 stars. But I would not recommend this book, and would definetly not rely on this book if you are wanting to draw manga."
4,Anatomy guides,"This book is about Anatomy but specifically tailored for Manga style.I have read this book & I will say it does show some nudity.BUT THAT IS WHAT ANATOMY IS ABOUT - BODY SHAPES.- To show body shapes it has to be done nude.ALL anatomy, how to books show you NUDE figures!!You can't add clothes till you get the general shape done!(General shape doesn't have to include the underwear lines either,as other review referance, general means basic sketch, or base line), (base lines are drawing term & you erase them later)There are other books in this series (as well as many other books just for cloths).If you want cloths buy the ""costume guide"" from this series.If you want Manga Anatomy buy this book; if you want more realistic Anatomy then get a book about that.I don't know why people are griping about the fact that everyone is in there underwear.This book is not about cloths; as I feel is clear in the title!"
3,"Prose-y, poem-y writing","Though the copyright date says 2000, this book feels like it came straight from the sixties.Little prose-y, poem-y writing with lovely line drawings, lightly highlighted here and there with yellow, all loosely talking about living now.Here's a short sample: ""Everything melted, rained, unraveled, became, grew wings, attempted flight, flopped, tried again, succeeded. Just another day. #317"""
5,Profound and delightful,"This book is filled with whimsy and delight, dances with wisdom andfrolics with spirit...it is a gift I have sent to all my women friends, both as ""keep"" gifts and as a ""pass-a-long"" gifts (write a comment in the book, then send it forward to others in a Flat Stanley/Persisting Yellow kind of journey). It lifts the heart, brings a smile and encourages the reader to stay true to his or her Truth of Self, all the while gently reminding the reader that All is Possible, in the most yellowish way.Illustrations are equally delightful and whimsical: a wonderful book!"
2,of interest,I liked the title of this book but I did not like the content. It was too vague. There was only one page that I really found to be clear and applicable to me. I think someone should write a book about YELLOW and how it relates to the 'feelings' of life. But this just was not what I was looking for. And the picture were far more crude than what I was comfortable with.
1,Don't waste your time or money,I always read the reviews of a book I am interested in. Every review of this book was positive so I decided to purchase it. I was highly disappointed after reading it. It was just plain silly and the illustrations are not even art in my opinion. I wouldn't even consider giving it as a gift.
5,One to Share,"I received this book as a Christmas present, the most wonderful present. When reading this book I experienced JOY and felt the love of my friend, Barbara who gave it to me. I wanted to share that feeling so I just ordered 10 more to give to my friends and family - the special women in my life I am close to. The book inspired feelings of excitement and re-awoke my sleeping inner adventuresome but delicate beautiful woman. Thank you to Monique Duval and Joanna Abbott Moss for such a treasure. I am off to start cookin'"
4,different color,"Although cute and a good fit, the ivory shoes were darker than expected, more of a cream with a hint of yellow than a true ivory. Didn't match my dress."
1,Would not recommend!,The first time I used it (and everytime after that) after about 3 min of blending it started to smell like burning plastic like I was overusing the motor and it could possibly catch fire. Then after the second wash the handle from the spout broke off so now there's no point for that. So now I have a useless blender that I've owned for less than a week.
3,Blender,Didn't like how the blender was working with my smoothies - this is better for smoothies that don't use ice.
4,I like it,"I don't say I love it, but I do like it. I have had it -in white- for three years I believe. I haven't had any problem with it at all.My daughter learned how to use it, so she broke off the juice releaser. It is rather hard to open and close and that is why it broke off. Luckily, she broke it while it was shut, so now I can still make smoothies but I have to pour from the jar itself not the spout. I am hoping it would retire soon so I can get a new one, but it seems there is a lot of energy still in it!"
3,Spectrum - 'Songs For Owsley' (Birdman) EP - 3 1/2 stars,"Five track CD single/EP that pays homage to Stanley Owsley,the manufacturer of LSD.Best tracks here are the atmospheric ""Liquid Intentions"",""Sine Study #1"" and the electronics-gone-mad ""New Atlantis"".'Songs For Owsley' notably had Spectrum down to a three piece.Sonic Boom had Alf Hardy(synthesizer,producer)and guitarist Pete Bain helping him put this EP together.Not bad."
3,Except For,"Great product, does everything you want it to, but terrible design which keeps it from getting 5 stars. The control element (which is a black piece of plastic that control the power) melts over time when you use the fryers high temp setting. Mine has melted and falling apart and there is nowhere to get replacement parts. Stay away from this product unless you like taking chances. The fryer is useless after this happens."
2,A book that should have lost itself,"As a general rule, I quite enjoy the Sherlock Holmes pastiches that Val Andrews writes. But not this one.My impression is that the idea for a short story occurred, but it was padded out to make is a short novel instead. Worse still, there is very little in the way of deduction in this story.The title itself is a little misleading, and the depiction of the regulars (including Inspector Lestrade) is done more as parodies than characters.And then there is a jokey bit, where law officers refuse to believe that Holmes and Watson are themselves because they don't look like the Sidney Paget illustrations from the Strand magazine. The author found this so enjoyable that it gets used twice.Not atrocious, but not what I'd expect from Val Andrews either."
3,not good for young kids,i am twelve and i stopped reading this book like halfway through. i dont usually do that. it bored me. i dont reccomend this to younger people.
3,White Fang,I thought that this book was ok. One reason I didn't like this book is that it was all over the place. There was a lot of killing animals. There was a little wolf that had problems. He could see well so he got in a lot of trouble. In the beginning there were some people that were sled doggers. They saw a wolf and it kept eating their sled dogs. They were getting kind of mad. But then the wolf was getting nicer. I would like to tell you more but I can't tell you without tell you the end.That is my book reveiw of WHITE FANG.
2,"Beautifully descriptive, but ultimately boring","White Fang is written with incredible descriptive language that facilitates a clear vision of everything that is happening. The words literally create a live vision of White Fang's life.Beyond that, this book is boring. Yes, White Fang's life if filled with action and would be suspense. However, it is all too predictable and to me read like a laundry list of a life history. Adventures as a puppy, check. Life as an Indian sled dog, check. King of all fighting dogs, check. And it goes on and on and on.I wont give away the ending, but I was thoroughly disappointed.However, I believe that even though this was written in 1906 White Fang is still alive somewhere. Since I think he is some sort of super wolf...possibly from the planet krypton."
4,Dated but interesting,"I read this book many many years ago, when I was a kid.I wanted to read it again. I had completely forgot it.And I wanted to read it in original.I found so interesting to read about the idea about education of that time.And disturbing to read about animal education and ideas of what it meant to train a dog.But alas, different times.So interesting though from the historical point of views."
4,it's a good book,i loved feeling the adventure in this book. So much strong emotion in this book . i personally loved it Anyone who wants a classical dog story this is your book
5,Love this book,Adore this book and read it at least once a year! Highly recommend the book for anyone that likes dogs or wolves.
4,What a classic,"I'm so pleased to finally read this book. Easy to read, easy to picture the events. Heavy on morals. A heart wrencher."
4,White Fang,This was a really good book. The beginning was pretty unexpected. Mainly because the whole book just changed views. It was very detailed and you could really get into it. I loved the part about when he was just born and how curious he was. I also felt bad for him towards the middle but I won't say for the sake of those who haven't read it yet. I will definatly be reading more of Jack London's books though.
5,AMAZING,"This book is a wonderful story about a wolf pup's life. If you love animals, especially dogs, you will adore this book."
5,Awesome Book!,"This book was just right. It's a great story about a dog who goes owner to owner to owner. Each owner tells him to do something different.The first owner he had told him to dogsled. He was a good dogsleder until, one day, he escaped from the owner. He was now in the wild. He left because he met a girl-wolf. They had children and they were happy. Soon they found an indian camp and the indian's gave them names and that's how White Fang got his name.His next owner was a very mean owner. He made White Fang do dog fights with other dogs. Even though he won every time, he was injured every time. One time, there was a new dog in town. He beat White Fang in seconds. A guy in the crowd brought White Fang from the owner and he tought White Fang to not attack everyone.This book is a great family book. If you like dogs, you will like this. It shows how White Fang changes after every new owner he has. So go get this book at a library or a book store."
3,What I thought of the book.,"I would give White Fang 3 stars. I gave it that because it starts off really slow and doesn't pick up until later on in the book. On the other hand, I enjoyed all the descriptive colorful words the author used to paint a mental image in the readers mind. The book is about a dog who in his life faces and over comes many trials and tribulations. I'd recommend this book to perople who like stories about animals, because it is a very heart warming and touching book to read."
3,A classic tale of a dog is an okay book,"White Fang was an okay book. I expected alot more from it though. White Fang was a dog and is the narrator of the story which is an interesting way to write. He was born part dog, part wolf, and only one of his five brother and sister cubs to survive. White Fang and his mother roamed the land in search of food until his mother died. Then an Indian takes him in as his master. By hitting White Fang if he misbehaved or by giving him a treat as a reward made him a well behaved dog. Then his Indian master sells White Fang to the bully Beauty Smith. Beauty Smith turns White Fang into a vicious killer. White Fang soon learns to fight in pit fights for Beauty Smith's benefit. Will White Fang ever have another caring master or will he die a fierce deadly killer.This book is kind of graphic for a child under 10 years of age."
1,This Book Was Boring,"I thought this book was the most boring thing ever. I am just a student and I was forced to read it for a report. I saw the movie and that was pretty good but the book was nothing like it. PLease if u haven't read it yet, don't waste your time."
1,It was long and boring,White Fang was written too old fasond. The words were too hard .The story was boring and long. It was also difficult to read.
3,Good but a little work,"Read White Fang because my son had to read it for school. I had never thought about a dog's perspective on things, but when I did I liked it. It was a little predictable, but worth the read."
5,The beauty of the written word.,I had forgotten how beautiful Jack London's writing was and still is. Morality and mutual respect between man and animal make for a story well worth reading at any age.
4,White Fang,Loved this book! A must read for dog lovers. My first London book n now im going to read call of the wild !
5,Ishmaelite life,"It is a superb adventure story. Jack London was always concerned about survival even while working himself into a nervous state. A strange animal had pursued them for days, half-dog, half-wolf. She had lured the sled dogs away from the fire. Three had gone missing. Wolves were responsible for the death of another dog and a man. The remaining man and two dogs were vigilant and careful. Finally the man was saved by other men.The wolf cub learned the law was eat or be eaten. Man-animals enforced justice through the use of tools. The cub perceived the men were fire-makers, they were gods. In White Fang's development, elements of nature and nurture warred.I know of no author comparable to Jack London in his ability to depict graphically the struggle of Darwinian forces. The work is as sharp and frank as it was when new. This is one of Jack London's major efforts. Revisiting it causes one to realize how merited its fame is."
4,Slowly But Surely,"After being told to read White Fang during my English class, I had high hopes. The book is known everywhere as a classic. As I started the book though, I found myself fighting to keep my eyes open. Parts 1 and 2 of White Fang have a copious amount of descriptions for little things. As the reader gets to the later chapters of the novel, he/she is rewarded for getting through. The story is exciting and fast-paced and I recommend it to anyone. Don't give up after just seeing how monotonous the first chapter is. Keep going and you will love this book!"
1,White Fang,"Awesome. Brilliant. It really does let you understand a dog's life a whole lot better, and I really enjoyed it."
2,Book format unacceptable,"Story is probably fine, but this version of it is too large to be comfortably read. It is about 10 by 8"", closed."
2,"""The White Fang""",The White Fang wasn't the best book that I have ever read. It was pretty exciting near the end and thats about it. If I had a choice of reading the book or watching the movie I would have just watched the movie. I saw the movie and I thought it was a lot better.
3,White Fang,The book is about a group of dogs who fight in a cage and who ever wins gets a troghy and 10 pounds of dog food. Then they race 15 miles and who ever wins gets 200 dollers and mittens for the dog and then they go to a worming house for the night.
1,dog story,I dont' believe this is Jack London's best work. The story line is trite: bad dog makes good. I didn't like his style of writing in this book.
3,not like the movie,"It's not like the movie by any means, and seems to be pretty repetitive. It's more from White Fang's perspective and the characters were different. Overall not a bad read, but not quite like I expected."
5,Not just another dog book!,"There is a reason that we read dog books,I think dog people read this type of book because it gives us another dog to remember as we grow old.Ther will only be a few that we will live with so we can add a few more to remember when we grow old.I will remember White Fang forever just like he was my own dog.He has been added to the list .Great Book"
2,that was slow,the book I am sure is great but it was too slow for me. My body is not ready for this intense action.
2,White Fang,I read about half this book put it down and didn't want to finish it so I didn't. It is the most boring book in the world.
2,white fang report,White Fang ReportThis book is about a wolf with a hard life. He gose to many places and has a lot of adventures. he is cought and let go.
1,this book was a boring and long book,white fang is a long book that would have been better if it was in better english rather than the unabridged edition which is the one i read . I think I would have liked it better if it were not as long and in better english.
1,2 long and 2 much description,"we read this book in class and every one in mi class thought it was boring. it has to much description for to many little things. the charecters arnt allowed to look at a tree with out there being a page of description. if you like long old fashioned storys then you might just find this one bearable. it is all about the wolf dog white fang who was the indians dog, then belonged to white men then a doctor who was finaly kind to him. it takes to long to get on to the proper story about white fang so you wonder where it is going at the start. a lot of his vocabulary is hard to understand. there is no suspense or at least hardly any. although it does have good description there is too much of it. o by the way sorry about my spelling!!"
1,"it's good to explain details, but this is just wrong",this book draws on about EVERY LITTLE DETAIL of EVERYTHING. It makes one paragraph equal to 5! DON'T buy this book for a book report is my suggestion! It just draws on and on and on!
5,Wonderful Book,"White Fang is about a wolf-dog who is learning to survive in the cold (forgot where he is) I have to say, once I picked up the book, I could barely put it down. The story is excellent, full or wonderful detail and descriptions. Not once the story get boring and it's so touching. The ending is real nice. I could read this book 5 times and I'll never get bored of it. This is a perfect book for anyone, but it is especially perfect for animal lovers."
4,White Fang Review,"White Fang is another timeless classic written by Jack London. It is similar, but not the sequel to, The Call of the Wild. In this book, the main character is named White Fang, and he is three-quarters wolf and one-quarter dog. He is a naturally strong and agile and throughout the book his masters use these skills to make him into a vicious and nasty dog that fights to kill. After meeting Weedon Scott, White Fang starts to change. White Fang then shows he could also be a loving and caring dog, different from before. Throughout his journey, humans and the Wild shape his destiny to make this one interesting and awesome book.Jack London uses the ideas of survival of the fittest and primordial rememberences to make White Fang a high action-packed and awesome book! I recommend this book to everyone who likes adventure books, everyone who likes high action-packed books, and everyone who likes to read in general!"
3,"Bring at first, but better later!","Hated, loved, and abused is the life of White Fang. He was a curious wolf and one day he was a little too curious. White Fang had gone right into the hands of Indians and his mom was captured along with him. White Fang was exiled and hated by his masters and other dogs in his pack. To get away from all of them White Fang decided to run away. When White Fang was away he saw his pack and his old master he decided to head back. Then he was loved and treated like a god when White Fang thought that his master was a god. After a while White Fang's ""god"" had to work at a trading post. There was a man at the trading post who wanted White Fang but, his owner wouldn't give White Fang away. One night White Fang got sold because his owner got drunk. White Fan's new owner abused dogs and had dog fights. One time, White Fang got very badly hurt in a dog fight against a bulldog. Will White Fang ever get freed? Read the book to find out."
5,GRETQ,ALBUM IS VERY DARK . YOU CAN REALY FEEL THE POWER OF PRIMAL BLACK METAL EXPLODING . METAL IS ONE OF THE BEST BAND BLACK METAL WILL EVER SEE
4,a good live album,the sound of live in leipzig is sad but the darkness of this album is terribly cool.a good live album
5,"RAW, BRUTAL & UGLY!","This is what black metal is all about, primitive, raw, brutal & ugly music. If you like Dimmu borgir (New) & Cradle of filth i don't recommend this for you. But if you like Darkthrone, Emperor (Old) & Burzum and bands from the underground, you will injoy the ugly, nihilistic nature of this album. The songs are not played as fast like they are on the new'er live albums. The recordings are ugly and bad, sounds like a cassett player with built in mic. for kids (If you remember them). So if you like pretty sound, and pro. rec. sound albums like Dimmu, Cradle, Emperor (New) & The new Gayhem, you will not like this album. But if you're into raw, brutal & ugly music, this is a must buy... ...order today"
5,Best live album ever!,"This is the only official album with Mayhem's ""true"" lineup. Dead was one of the best vocalists ever, so don't waste your money buying ""De mysteriis dom sathanas"", because the vocals there cannot even compare to Dead.If you wanna hear songs like ""Freezing Moon"" the way they were supposed to be, buy this one.R.I.P. Per Yngve Ohlin"
4,Dead and Euronymous live on....,"This was the first Mayhem disc I'd ever bought and had previously only heard the classic 'The Freezing Moon'. So, I ordered this live disc out of curiosity. It is extreme, raw, and intense darkness. While the sound is not the best; it is a great cd. Dead's vocals will blow you away and Euronymous' guitar work shreds. If anyone is interested in the true roots of the black metal scene, pick up this disc. Mayhem was one of the scene's founding fathers. Dead & Euronymous (RIP)."
1,terible product,this produst did not not and is a wate of your money and time .The products does not even have the iggredients.Stay away from pretrika products
5,A Book of Books,"Why not read a young ladies open heart, mind and soul she pours out on paper with words so beautifully decorated? Let yourself live in someone else's eyes and walk their steps. When you open this book you step into a world of a pouring waterfall of emotions. Why not learn from someone else's eyes? I pose that question. Know all you have to do is take the first step."
5,Excellent,"This is the first mix cd I bought by Andy Hughes and I was not disappointed. This is a great cd. This was a great selection of tracks, all mixed perfectly. If you are still a little new to this kind of music, like I am, this will be a good starting cd. Well worth the price and the wait."
5,awsome for a cd practicly done in her basement,"skye did an awsome job she has made 3 of her own music videos but not tangeled up in me skye IS AN AWSOME SINGER she said ""my second album will be better no more crappie drum machines im moveing up from the basement into the studio"" if u like tangeled up in me ull love this cd if u like avril lavigne ull like this cd she is better then britney 1000000000000000000000000000 times better so i suggest u buy this so u have sumtihn to hold u over till her second cd (rumored june 20th 2006)"
4,Noise from the Basement,"Coming from a teen, this album is really good, and you can see Skye will only get better!This album is more for teens dealing with problems in they're life and towards the end of the album is more mature songs and is my fav. part of the album. Buy this album, it's worth it"
3,Skye Sweetnam,"I've never liked Skye Sweetnam too much. I think she's an okay singer, but not worthy of a recording contract. The only songs I like on this album are ""Tangled Up In Me"", because it's kind of catchy, and I've heard it about ten times in the past week, and Skye's re-make of ""Heart of Glass"".Skye Sweetnam is somewhere in the Hilary Duff catergory, which, if you ask me, is the WRONG catergory to be in. I warn you, listening to either of those two too much will make you like them, when really their CDs aren't worth of your hard-earned money.(...)"
3,Ear-Candy...,"Yes people, thats all it is, Ear-Candy. Its full of catchy hooks and stupid lyrics about kicking soda machines, not wanting to go to school, and girls named shrada...If you actually like this kinda stuff, chances are you're either a 15 year old girl who thinks converse shoes and jelly bracelets are ""cutting edge"", or you're someone who looks to MTV for all your latest trends/anti-trends...Not that I recommend ANYTHING in this genre, but if you MUST indulge yourself in cheesy pop-rock, stick with stuff from avril lavine or ryan cabrerea (spellings wrong, I know) and leave this Newbie to chance listens ONLY..."
1,Please make it stop,"Hey record labels...don't you think it's a little late to be manufacturing your own version of Avril Lavigne? This CD is such a cliche...monotone vocals that explode into raging screams, ""chunk-a-chunk-chunk"" guitars, and whiney lyrics about how miserable life is. Don't worry though, because pop culture trends die out quick. Skye Sweetnam will be back cooking hamburgers for minimum wage before you know it."
1,Worse than horrible,"Who does Skye Sweetnam think she is covering Blondie's 'Heart of Glass'? This ""record"" if that's what you want to call it is horrible. Skye cannot sing well at all and her songwriting is mediocore. This is just like everyone else and she reminds me of Hilary Duff. Her first single 'Billy S' is a joke! This isn't a song for kids - it's trying to sound rebellious but it just sounds really stupid. Dropping out of school is not cool, never was and never will be. Then she thinks she's edgy and rock with her other single 'Tangled Up in Me' - no substance, ONCE again. Other songs that stuck with me that suck are 'It Sucks' - yep, it sure does and 'Unpredictable' - your crappy music is so predictable, get over it. Pathetic attempt at a record. Go home."
3,Very promising new act,"I am just back from a live concert of Skye Sweetnam in Oberhausen, Germany, where she played as a support act of Britney Spears. I have never heard of her before this evening.I am still excited about the energy and power of her (and her bands) performance. This was what I expect from a concert - pure live energy. I am interested to hear the CD to see if the live energy can be really transferred to CD. I definetely want to hear more from her!By the way, the performance had more power than Britneys performance (which was o.k. but not authentic). It often remembered me to an Avril Livigne show - or what would I expect from that show."
4,Reviwed by Rosie!,I really liked the c.d cause the lyrics were good and the tune of the music were really cool. I recommend this c.d. ANd Ske has a really nice voice. Buy this c.d!
3,interesting,"im not gunna knock her down because i actually like some of her songs...smoke n mirrorstangled up on mebut thats about it. honestly, i listened to tha album about twice then put in on tha shelf where it now collects dust.but if you wanna buy it, then sure. why not? i did..but its also on the shelf now...so whatever."
3,Very promising artist - 3.5 stars,"Comparisons to Avril will be made, and there is some Avril in Skye's style. We shouldn't lose sight of the fact that this isn't a big, manufactured production, though. The garage-y playing is enjoyable. And her vocals match the energy of the songs. Some lyrics are immature, like on the otherwise appealingly catchy ""Billy S."" An anti-school song is fine, but it sounds like how a younger girl would put it. But other songs like ""Fallen Through"" are very well written. I'm anxious to hear what Skye comes up with next."
5,Skye is great!,"Skye Sweetnam is not even pop, it's a lot more rock as it says. And it is rock. Or pop/rock. But it is not pop or even cheesy. I say not it's rock. And she is way awesome. Sure, the songs are mostly 2 minutes but songs are repetitive anyways. It can be hard to enjoy but there are a few that are close to 3 or over 3 minutes. She is talented though, very, more then just potential.1. Number OneSingle, Awesome2. Billy S,single, pop but very good3. Tangled Up In MeSingle, very good4. I Don't Really Like YouI'm liking them more but I like the few from 8-135. I Don't CareGood song6. Heart Of GlassAlso good7. SharadaNot a fave but good8. It SucksVery good, even though it does talk of cheating and shallowness9. Fallen ThroughAwesome for a slow song10. HypocriteAwesome song, well known11. UnpredictableAwesome12. Shot To PiecesAwesome13. Smoke + MirrorsIt's okay14. Bonus Track 1A favorite."
5,Awesomeness!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I havent got this CD but I have listened to all of the songs.My mom said she would get this for me if I did some extra chores(Noooo!!!) Anyway, BUY IT it is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,The Skye Is the Limit!,"All I have to say is....This Cd is freaking awesome! Skye Rocks my world she has a great voice and a great band that really come through on the cd. She may be Avril-ish(hate that term) but I like Avril as well. This girl is gonna go places just you wait and see...read this review in 5 years and remember that I told you so. One thing to remember how old she, so don't expect sucha deep moving record that is thought prevoking, like Liz Phair(reccomended), her music is what you should take it for eceltic rock pop with an attitude."
2,Size Misleading,"The decal is nice, color as described, but the size of 6' by 8"" is the size of the packaging. The actual decal is only about 5' round. This is very misleading! I ordered 2 and would have sent them back but the cost wasn't worth it. Delivery was timely, postage was high for flat paper product in an envelope."
3,Tankjock,Nice video pac..like the series and it just keeps getting better. The guality is great and price is too..Guys whom like Oz will like this series.
2,REQUESTED RECEIVED NO PRODUCT,Hello to date have not received the 3 products from OZ.Expected shortly.RegardsMarcelo
5,Oz Season 5 Rocks!,Season 5 of Oz still has the edge and intensity of the previous 4 seasons as the residents of Emerald City carry out their feuds and schemes. Stellar acting and terrific writing and directing all around.Oz is one of the best television shows.Highly recommended.
3,Wondermints Rock,"I found out about this band from an English friend who's been listening to them for a while. I went out and got Bali and really dug it. I had to go out and get Wonderful World Of and Wondermints right away. I find this one to be the lesser album of the three, lacking the cohesion in the songlist found in Bali and the funky beats of Wonderful World Of. This is still a great album though."
2,"quite frankily, the myth is better than the album...","i bought this album after hearing about them from a fellow beach boys fan. i'm a huge pet sounds fan, but i love all kinds of orchestrated rock from ""the left banke"" to ""beulah."" this album is not that good, people. it's not even ""okay."" there are way better takes on the ""brian wilson"" (read: phil spector) sound. whether it's ""the ladybug transistor"" or ""the apples in stereo."" heck, check out a great vancouver band called ""ashley park"" as well. the production on this is so rooted in the eighties/nineties that it's almost unlistenable. they may be good road musicians but it doesn't show on this album, especially since some of tracks use lamo drum loops ""a la stone roses."" you would be better off going through the elephant 6 label's recordings or even merge stuff. to be honest, i didn't even find the compositions that scintillating, regardless of the production. chord and change-wise, they're interesting....but that doesn't make the songs good."
5,stunning,"Realism and beauty make this a truly magnificent mulitcultural addition to anyone's library -- child or adult. The words are simple for children, and familiar for adults. It inspires us to explore who we are as a people, both collectively and individually. It is a great book for launching important dialogue with children."
5,these are great!,"I bought these to use with my electric flosser. I am thrilled with the product, using the electric flosser."
3,Not my cup of tea.,"I am not sure why this book gets such good reviews. I have read most of it (from front to back) and found myself skipping alot towards the end. Like you'd imagine, by doing both C++ and Java examples it ends up covering neither well. If Bolton absolutely had to have examples in both languages, I think he would have done better by splitting it up into two books and then going into the level of detail that Henning and Vinoski do in their seminal book. It's a bit ridiculous to buy a book this size and still feel like you are not getting enough information.The main selling point that it has is it includes information on later CORBA features (like Components and Objects by Value) that aren't in other books. If you REALLY want to understand what is going on, go with the Advanced Corba Programming with C++, though it is starting to show its age a bit."
4,Decent,"It's a pretty good book, though, not really comparable to ""Advanced CORBA programming with C++"". If you really want a good CORBA reference book get Henning and Vinoski's book. The best thing about this book is that it also includes Java which makes it a pretty good buy. Not all of the code is available electronically on the book's website which can make it cumbersome if you want to actually try to run some of examples...."
5,Great CORBA book for Java Developers,"As a Sr. Java developer, I was looking for a good CORBA book with a Java slant. Until I found this one, I wasn't having much luck. Look no further. There are lots and lots of examples in Java (and C++). I've only read 100 pages, but so far, I really like this book.Money well spent."
4,"Good Value, Great examples","I recently purchased this book to augment my other book, ""Advanced CORBA"". While both books are good, Pure CORBA leans towards the practical, and Advanced CORBA leans to the referencie. When you also consider that this book costs a good deal less than the Advanced CORBA book, this is probably the first book of the two you should buy."
5,Live At The Lucky Lounge,I found this CD to be really awesome. Lisa Tingle has the most incredible voice I've heard in a long time. There are not many artist that can sing live and sound just like they do in a recording studio.
2,why? tell me why?,"I always hate it when I found the B-side of a certain single is a live version or a cover version. why? to captured the energy from their live show? yeah.... right :(`. but, ""You Only Live Twice"" ain't that bad, it just.... LIVE"
4,Yet another tool in the Agile toolbox!,"The ""Agile"" umbrella includes multiple approaches/lenses from which to view, practice and evolve software and teams. Alistair's material offers an additional lens. So when reading this material, I don't believe it was ever his intent for people to pick up Crystal and say ""This is it"". Rather, this material offers an alternative framework of thought that would nicely meld/synthesize with other characteristics/practices/behaviors under the Agile umbrella of software evolution. I've not personally applied the material yet .. but could see it's inter-relationship to those things I do currently practice today under the Agile space."
5,Clearly Useful,"Some of the clearest thinking in the Agile space. This text communicates the concept and spirit of what Agile is and why we do it. Cockburn is, gratefully, opposed to dogma and for ""thinking"" on the part of software development teams - what a concept!"
3,Not as good as I had hoped,The ear wells are not deep enough. It doesn't appear to have auto-shut off and the batteries died very quickly.
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"With all of the hype Peltor claims about their products, I was disappointed with the value for the price. Other protection at half the cost does as good of a job. I paid too much."
1,They simply do not work very well,I have owned a pair of the Peltor 7S headset since the early 1990s and those continue to work extremely well for me. I purchased the 6S thinking I would like the behind the head design & slightly slimmer profile and that I would let my son use the 7Ss.After a full morning at the range I am returning these and just buying anohter set of 7s.They do a very poor job of noise suppression. My ears were still uncomfortable with these on regardless of how I had the volume controls set.They do not work AT ALL with a rifle (at least an AR15 style rifle). The behind-the-ear band prevented me from getting a sight picture through the scope because it pushed against the buttstock of the rifle.They are inconvenient to pack because they do not fold up.Wished I would have read the reviewes before purchasing. Glad Amazon is great with returns.
3,Disappointing,"I bought these hearing protectors to use at the local gun range. They work moderately well, but I find the noise reduction not quite adequate for range use. These don't have enough padding to block out enough sound of even a 9mm, let alone the guy next door shooting a 500 magnum. They work fine for outdoor shooting.They also don't fit on my wife or adult daughter, both of whom have narrow faces. They only seem to stay on my big head (in more ways than one). Women or men with shorter or narrower jaws need to look at the over the head hearing protectors.On the plus side, the electronics do allow me to keep a normal conversation while shooting at the range, and their price is far below the pro version electronic hearing protectors."
4,Peltor tactical 6s,"These electronic ear muffs work well. However, the batteries are diffacult to replace and the padding is not the best for cold weather. Overall it is average for the price."
1,my ears are still ringing,"This hearing protector is OK for hand gun noise, but it is totally inadequate for large rifle noise. I would not recommend this product for any rifle bigger than a .22"
5,AverageJoeReview,"Used these at the gun range while working and ordered them online from my I Phone. These muffs are comfortable, don't interfere with you a wearing a hat, have volume controls on each side which let you hear what other people are saying and seem to be rugged in design. I would recommend these as a great buy."
4,Ear Protection Very Good,"I wanted to upgrade my ear protection to one that would allow me to hear conversations but shut out the sound when shooting. For the price of this product, I'm very happy with the results."
1,Terrible,"I work on a shooting range every day, and found this to be one of the worst hearing protection products I have used. They fell apart after very little use, and the behind the neck mount was poor at best."
4,loved this book true grit and romance,"This is a good story by Iris Gower. Full of Welsh heart and song, and showing the trials and tribulations of the people of that era, with a little romance thrown in."
5,Sylvester,"I absolutely LOVE Sylvester. He is one of the greatest singers of the '80s and I'm still sad that he passed away. I've spent many happy hours dancing my tail off to his songs,and they NEVER get old.It's over 20 years later,and he still makes me want to jump out of my chair and hit the dance floor. Long live Sylvester!"
3,"Interesting and quick read, but not great for study","To start,""Heights of Courage"" is an outstanding book, and a very personally told story of what it is to lead and fight in armored combat. The best parts of this book come in three chapters, where Kahalani relived experiences of getting hit and wounded in Egypt, moving mounted in tanks through a village,and when Kahalani relives the attack into Syrian territory. I had to rate this book lower, becuase i was highly dissapointed in two things. 1. Kahalani constantly refers to units by individuals names...which can be confusing as to whether he is speaking of the Division Commander or his Tank driver. 2. the book is totally lacking in Maps or tactical drawings to clarify the situations he is describing. The scale of the 3 maps provided is so great and lacking in detail, that one can not gain any aspect of the lower unit tactical situation, and are truly political, not military maps."
3,"Nice memoir, but not a lot of detail.","The book is an easy (and quick) read. However, the author doesn't take much time to go into detail about equipment or tactics. It's a very basic memoir about the difficulties of moving a tank force around from place to place in order to meet a numerically overwhelming enemy, especially when moving at night with very little in the way of modern western war technology. Impressive book none the less. If you like military history, and are interested in a single person's perspective of a few battles in the Arab-Israeli war, then this would be a good read."
2,Have you ever read the dictionary cover to cover?,Reading this book in order to learn QuarkXpress is akin to reading the dictionary cover to cover in order to learn the English language. Can it be done? Maybe. But it is not recommended.This book may be useful as a detailed reference guide on a given subject but it should not be used to learn Quark. After attempting to read this book cover to cover for 70+ pages I had to put it down and find another quick start book to learn Quark.
4,QuarkXPress a solid Program,"This program makes it possible to make all kind of card, invitations, newsletters, etc. It is reliable but not as intuitive as I would have liked it to be."
4,Excellent and concise,"I have read a couple of the Visual Quick Start books by these authors and find them to be readable and concise.The way the material is portrayed is precise, and conveys the general idea of the task to be accomplished with a minimum of extraneous information.Highly recommended.The only downside is that there is not example material included with the books.A"
2,silly goose,"slippers finally arrived and i was a little bit dissapointed. construction was cheap, goose fill was light and overall flimsy. if you want to wear it twice, then thats what its worth."
1,Not what I had hoped for,"I'm disappointed that they are not warm. Unless I wear socks and my feet are warm to start out these slippers don't keep my feet warm. I bought some down filled slippers several years ago that are wonderful. However, they are worn out and held together with duck tape. I wish I could find another pair like them as they are truly warm, get your feet warm when cold and keep them warm. I wouldn't purchase these slippers :("
4,Almost too warm,"These booties are so warm that your feet sweat, in turn causing them to get a little cold again. Overall, I like the product but wish that the material on the inside was softer."
3,Soles are a downside.,"I purchased these after thinking that my cold feet would be toasty warm in these. The price wasn't outrageous either. But it seems that you get what you pay for.The upper part is not bad but the sole has no cushioning inside, making it very thin. Also there isn't any type of anti-skid tread whatsoever on the sole. A bit dangerous on hardwood floors.I would honestly only recommend this slipper if you have wall to wall carpeting throughout your entire house."
1,White Down Slippers Navy Large,Not what i expected. Slippers too small and tight on the toes. Better to be able to try them on first.
2,goose down slippers,"The price explains the quality it is true you get what you pay for. The ""down"" in these slippers comes out like crazy and they have feathers as well as down, the points poke you, but they do keep your feet warm. Would be ok if you don't wear slippers very often but for high usage I would go with a better quality product"
4,Best Viennese Cookbook,"I was so happy to find this out-of-print cookbook again. It has all the traditional dishes and deserts just I as remember them. My Austrian friends living in the U.S. actually find this cookbook very useful because the measurements are in American cups, tablespoons etc."
1,Works with the magic touch,"It works only with the magic touch...and it's really hard to find the magic. The locking mechanism is, in fact, painful to figure out. You *think* the lid is securely on and the container in its base, but it still won't start, which results in a couple seconds of magical finagling to get it to work. The leaking is also a problem, but generally it occurs only when the seal is not properly inserted into the blender after washing but it is tricky to get it exactly positioned to prevent leakage. If not properly reinserted, the replacement seal can even shred and require replacement! Now, both of these points can be written off as just user error, but even after owning this appliance for a while, it is still cumbersome. Common tasks like taking a lid on and off, and washing all the parts, should be extremely user-friendly. Unfortunately, Krups failed completely here."
2,"blender ok, processor stinks","I do not have this exact model, but I purchased the food processor attachment for the Power X Plus, which is now discontinued. However, the attachment seems to be exactly the same. It is a royal pain to get on and off the blender base--there is a little lever underneath the processor that needs to be pulled to one side to fit over the base. But you can't see it and it pinches your fingers every time. Also, after using the food processor only a handful of times and washing it in the dishwasher, the lid began to form cracks. So, we went to handwashing. In a little less than a year, even with handwashing, a large crack develeped in the bowl. Just last week I got my last use out of the thing and had to throw it away.Although the motor is powerful, the blender holds plenty liquid, and I love the convenience of a combination appliance, I will not be replacing this unit with another krups."
2,hard to clean and leaky,"I bought this blender for it's dual usage capacity- blender and food processor. While it worked, it worked very well. However, after several uses, both the blender and food processor became leaky. The food processor is also tricky to figure out how to start. At first I thought it was broken but I called Krups and they were able to help me with that. Finally, the unit is difficultto impossible to keep clean. There are places that you just can't reach such as the base where the jar would attach."
2,Not worth it.,"Besides other problems, my biggest issue is that this is Extremely difficult to clean after 1 year of use.. Eventhough every thing works fine, but we have to throw it because the blade wont come out, and there are stains that developed between the glass jar and white plastic holding it. Nothing reaches there..It works fine and everything but is a real mess to clean. Do not buy it. Waste of money."
1,Food processor frustrating!,"The instructions state that the food processor will only fit on the base when the lid is locked. I followed the instructions time and again, but it still will not fit onto the base. If there is some trick to this, I'd like to know what it is. This is supposed to be a ""safety feature!"""
2,stinky piece of nonsense,"it is a waste of time, exactly what the first reviewer said.. there is a magic touch needed and you feel like throwing the machine out the window. I bought this junk at Zabar's in Manhattan a while ago.. no wonder it was so cheap. and i thought i was getting a bargain!"
4,Classic Alastair Maclean,"Really one of Macleans less known books - but it follows the fast adventure pace which his earlier novels demonstrate. Straightforward characters with a strong bent for heroism and adventure, a fast moving plot with several double crosses, smooth and engrossing storyline with simple and elegant descriptions. Maclean was famous for books like Where Eagles Dare, and the Guns of Navarone which are full of hereoes doing relatively heroic tasks and facing impossible odds. This one fits the bill. A great light adventure read."
4,Great product-hard to find,"Barney is king in our home so anytime we can find these VHS we get as many as we can find. Having said this, the particular seller we purchased this VHS pack from sent us USED video tapes when they advertised the VHS tapes were NEW. Even after sending a complaint, we never did get a response from the seller to refund or replace the used tapes."
5,An Excellent Teaching Tool!,I found Ms. Leonhard's writing style to be very engaging. She helps the student become involved in his/her work in an interesting way. It is an excellent teaching tool! I cannot wait for Ms. Leonhard to write more!
2,Not an exciting book!,"If you are looking for a good book to learn writing, this is NOT the one for you. It is not an exciting one and you would feel bored after a while. If it is your textbook, then you have no choice, just buy it.Note:If you are looking for a useful book to learn writing, order this one:Essentials in Academic Writing by Ann Hogue- Highly recommended"
4,Why aren't albums like this released in the States?,"Why do we have to get imports to get good albums like this? Glenn Hughes' voice sounds awesome on this CD-- listen to his solo bit in the middle of ""Ride The Storm"". Turner's got a great voice as well. Where have all the great rock singers (like these guys) gone to?? Most of today's bands have the singer as their weakest link.... GOODBYE!! It's a shame albums like this aren't promoted here and get airplay... this should be a top seller instead of the junk that is so popular nowadays."
2,bar bar bar,"The content of this book is not the problem, it is its poor organizational structure. It is redundant and organized in an unhelpful way, so that the read focusses on the repetitive statement(s), leaving the seemingly tidbits of research and theory to get lost. It's like having a simple base beat up too loud and dragging on throughout a whole album. They could have summed up the content of this book in 2-3 short articles with greater success. The content, however, was helpful!"
2,It could have been much better...,"I tried to like this book - the old series was very good. But in the end it just wasn't very good. Strike one is the lack of evidence before giving the solution. A good mystery should have an solution that is obvious when you reread it. Many of the solutions here rely on information which is never given and only make sense when extra evidence is given in the solution. Strike two is the lack of believability. I realize that Clue mysteries have always been light, but it loses something with the ""I killed him because he made a mess of the house"" or ""Look he's dead - anyone want to go for coffee"" style. And strike three is that the stories seem to drone on without really developing the story.It could have been made so much better with a little effort."
2,Little more than a piece of fluff,"While the book has some pretty pictures, it is woefully lacking any real information. It's basically a coffee-table book to be glanced at briefly. Anyone who wants to really learn anything about either the Packard Corporation or the car itself would be much better served by the Beverly Rae Kimes, James A. Ward, or Arthur W. Einstein books. It is certainly not worth the price in comparison with the other texts available."
3,"Good follow up to the 1st, but...","What kills this one for me are the clean vocals! Musically it's better written and produced than the first self-titled album(which is still a good release, mind you), but the clean, off-key vocals make me cringe. Garm does the growl and screech wonderfully and should have stuck with that style. Amazes me how many people refer to this as 'Black' metal; sounds like 'Viking' metal to me."
