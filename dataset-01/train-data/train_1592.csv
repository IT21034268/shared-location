3,wish i would have known...,"for what it is, it's alright. yeah, it is chock full of bad computer animation, but im ok with that. what i wish i would have known before i bought it is that this is just one episode of many in an entire season. now here's the kicker: the price for the entire season (which is in 2D) costs the same amount as this one episode (which is in 3D). had i known, i would have sprung for the entire season in 2D.now if you have your heart set on the 3D nature of this blu ray disc, then go ahead and purchase it. personally i wouldn't buy it for the ""3D special effects"", but if youre into that kind of thing then i say ""go for it"".i am just interested in ""spacey"" kind of stuff...so, had i known that i could have purchased this as a part of an entire season in normal 2D for the same cost i totally would have! i only just realized this after the fact.hope this helps. as justin beiber (aka jimmy fallon) says: ""these are just my reflections."""
2,Not worth the 3D experince!!,"for a 2007 release, I expected the experience would be cooler, the CGI was very poor and not worth it at all."
1,Where's The 3D?,"I preordered this through Amazon and it arrived yesterday. In October I bought a top of the line Panasonic 3D TV & Panasonic 3D Blu-Ray player. The other 7 3D discs I own display great 3D images with the shutter glasses. That's what I was expecting for this disc. However when I popped it into the player and picked 3D from the PLAY menu, NO 3D. Usually on this TV when you hit PLAY you get a momentary box in the upper right hand corner of the screen that says PLAY and under it FULL 3D. This time only says PLAY. Tried all the options in the 3D setup menu to no avail. Last resort figured maybe the PLAY menu was mislabeled so picked 2D. No matter whether I picked 2D or 3D, the picture was EXACTLY the same. Very disappointed to pay this price for a short documentary and not get the 3D. It's going back to Amazon. (and yes, my TV and player have the latest firmware updates)"
5,Totally Amazing!!!,"This is probly tied for the best 3-d programm out there. (avatar 3-d) Everything pops out with great detail, feels like you're floating in space having a first hand look at the 7 wonders of the galaxy, this show is perfectly done, I wish the History Channel would do more like it. gh"
3,3D mini Universe,"I bought this thinking it was the entire season 1 since I have the older version blu-Ray - That is the non 3D version.Thus only 3 Stars.My mistake - it is only 1 show at 47 minites, but it is in the newer 2nd gen 3D.When will the entire Season 1 - etc. come out in 3D???"
3,Good Purchase,"This was an ok movie, but I expected more. I guess because I have seen real pictures from the Hubble and thought I would see more of those."
1,do not waste your money,"Not even worth for 5$. I bought 3D version,could not even watch for 10 min.do not waste your money"
3,The universe,Eh more for kids I love astrology but this has like a top ten countdown it's pretty cool but like I said more for kids than adults oh well
3,Not so good 3d,I don't like the 3d effects I expect more of this documental but it's okay. The shipping was extremely fast and the item arrive in perfect condition. But I don't recommend this others buyers.
4,It is useful,"This product is very good you will learn many things about universe in 3D view, You will engiy watching The universe. But i hoped that its duration was more than what it is ."
3,Checking our 3d,We actually purchased this because it was 3D and we had just gotten TV. Ok it was 3D. We expected a little more but all we can say is it was good not great
4,Great test of a New 3D TV,"An excellent test of a new Sony 55"" Blue Ray 3D. While not 3D throughout, this was exceptional! I am pleased that we bought this."
1,too much low quality computer generated footage,"If I saw it before buying I would not buy it.I expected too see a lot of real stunning footage. Instead what I got was a bunch of low quality computer generated graphics. Seriously, why did they add this crappy spaceship which you're supposedly traveling from one wonder to another. It would be much better without it.Also they overdid computer graphics of asteroid belt. In an interview a scientist says that the distance between asteroids is so large that when you stand on one of them others would appear to be dots. And yet computer generated graphics shows a part of asteriod belt crowded with large rocks where each rock is clearly visible. Makes me wonder if the rest of computer generated graphics is accurate."
4,It's a keeper,"This book has information on virtually every manufacturing process imaginable. As dry as that may sound, it is really well put together. The authors for each segment are the top people in their respective industries. It is information being presented by those that actually use it and create it. I was required to buy this for a class, but I will definitely not be selling it back."
4,Design handbook,"Great book for any junior designer in or fresh out of school, lots of important informations on manufacturing processes and there design guide lines. Includes lots of tolerance charts (metric and imperial)and information on various material: form metal to plastics. The biggest weakness is the lack of information on the latest technologies (laser cutting, water cutting and prototyping). Still its a mustFÃ©lixIndustrial DesignerAquam incMontreal canada"
1,Shipping is Ridiculous! Misgiving pic-you only get 1 cover!,"I ordered 2 sets of these can covers because the shipping was triple the amount for 1 set. I received 1 set and when I wrote and told the company that I only received 1 set (2 covers) instead of 2 sets (4 covers)-they sent me 1 more cover. The picture of the product shows 2 can covers when in reality you only receive 1 cover. The shipping on 1 of these plastic...very light covers is $8.97 and the price for the can cover is $1.99 for ONE (1). If I had realized this before I ordered it, I would not have ordered from this company! It is the only can cover that fits Fancy Feast cans...but you can find it elsewhere for less!!!"
3,Kitty Caps/Pup Top,"Product fits the small cat food cans that I have been looking for, but is somewhat hard to get the lid off the can."
2,Not for neophytes,"Despite the reviews and the suggestive title, this book will NOT provide a grounding in metal framing for those wishing to convert from traditional skills. Designers/architects will learn nothing regarding metal framing compared to wood framing. Little or nothing in the way of loading is provided. This book may have tips for seasoned experts but it certainly assumes that you come to the table with plenty of metal framing experience."
2,Lack of architectural drafting & design details in metal stud framing...,I was looking for a book to help me complete an architectural drawing for office partition wall framing with metal studs. I found this book is not written for readers who want to find details in architectural drafting and design of metal stud framing in order to comply with commercial building codes.
3,Classroom textbook use only,"The author admits he wrote this book to assist with classroom teaching. As an additional explanation to a teacher explaining it, the book would be great. The problem is his explanations are hard to follow and the picture angles and lighting make it hard to see many of the details he refers to. I ended up skimming the book for good basic ideas. He obviously is very knowledgable in the field."
1,disapointed,"I am a building contractor who deals with wood, so I know how to put things together. I recently picked up a commercial job with metal studs. I thought by buying this book it would help me be better able to make the conversion to metal. I was wrong. I found the information in the book and the pictures to be lacking detail(the pictures are dark and non discriptive with no illustrations). There are some good tips but overall I found it to be useless. The information that I needed was not in the book. If you are experienced in metal the book might have some merrit. I had to use other sources to get the information that I required."
2,Cheap but fits,The case fits my phone perfectly however the holes for the charger and camera are not in the right places.
1,i did not received this product,I orderd this item almost 2 months agoI have not received itI did not even get a confirmation on this and other item I ordered from this sellerbad bad bad service
5,"pack a punch, sizzle and snap","Now this is one hot little number of a cookbook. Wow! How can you omit salt, cut down on fat, yet increase taste in your meals? Spice it up! From soup to nuts - African Peanut Soup to Sherried Pine Nut Yogurt, here you can find recipes for appetizers all the way to lip smacking desserts!Linda Matthie-Jacobs has created light fare dishes that pack a punch, sizzle and snap, and just plain leave you satisfied. You can tame the fire a bit, if need be, but you will certainly not be at a loss for something different to stir up at chow time.I love the tidbits and trivia that are sprinkled throughout the book. I never would have thought of roasting watermelon seeds or that capsaicin (the chemical found in hot peppers) has been used medicinally for centuries. While you are stirring up a four course meal you can flip the pages and learn something new. Keep the water jug and a loaf of bread handy to put out the fire, and dig in!"
1,Invalid audio format,"This disc is advertised as a DVD-Audio, yet would not play in my DVD-A player and is more expensive than most DVD-As. I have no idea what format it is. Fortunately Amazon gave me a full refund, even though I had opened the case (to find that it's worthless)."
4,Great Table for the Price,"Vendor got the table here prior to date promised- Friday before Christmas. My husband loves it. Well built, and nice enough to use as a foyer table if you don't have a game room. Only wish is that accessories were a bit higher end, but for the money, I can't complain."
2,Not as advertised,"This is my third table ordered and it is the same as the other two. Size advertised is completely incorrect. All three of the tables were much smaller than the deminsions given with the product. There are several blemishes on each table. The blemishes I can deal with but the incorrect size is very upsetting. I have not sent them back because the price was relatively low and I do not want to bother paying shipping to return. The tables could have been very nice but it is the size issue. This table especially is for an entrance way and it measures 23"" but shows 36"" in the product description. I will not buy again. The RIGHT thing to do would be to refund a portion of the price I paid."
5,batman tv series,ADAM WEST WHERE IS MY COLLECTION I LOVE BATMAN AND HIS TV SHOW.BATGIRL PLEASE SAVE ME I WANT MY BATMAN COLLECTION SEASON 1 THUR 3.RIGHT NOW.
5,1966 Batman STILL not released on DVD yet!,"Just so everyone is clear on the NON-release of this wonderful series: The 1966 Batman movie is released, but only because it was contracted differently than the series was. Just because the 1966 movie is out has NOTHING to do with the release of the series' episodes. There is much more at work here than just FOX and WARNER BROTHERS and the rights. Don't you think they KNOW they have a money maker here? Yes, of course they do. It's not them---entirely.There's also GREENWAY productions, William Dozier's company that produced the series. I think THAT is the hang up because we don't have the GREEN HORNET released either and it was made by Dozier too. That is the common denominator here. The Green Hornet is not owned by WB and fighting with FOX, so where is it??? I think GREENWAY PRODUCTIONS is the (excuse the pun) villain here. I may be wrong, but until we know for sure, it's as good as any other reason."
2,There's a reason...,"There is a reason why this isn't available on DVD or video.DC Comics has spent the better part of thirty five years trying to overcome all of the campy connections to this image of the Dark Knight. As a Batman fan of thirty plus years I can honestly say that I feel as though this series should stay buried in the past. Sure, I loved this show when I was a kid, but no one who is a true fan of the comics really wants to see this. It's bad enough that you can't mention Batman without someone humming that theme song from the sixties. This series offered no dark image of a driven and obsessed Bruce Wayne (I believe he only mentions his parents murder once in passing), the ""Rogues Gallery"" wasn't in the least truely threatening, and most of the action takes place in broad daylight. I understand many people would love to see this released, but I doubt they are the ones who follow the continuity in the pages of Detective Comics, the ""True"" Batman."
5,Holy injustice - Batman's not on DVD.,"I watched and enjoyed Batman when I was a kid. Back then, I took it seriously. Now, I'd like to get it so that I can appreciate it for what it is. As a side note, I'd also like to see The Flash on DVD as well."
5,What's the hold up?,"I've already got the Blu-Ray Star Trek TOS, computer graphics and all, DVD of ""Lost In Space"" series....so what's taking so long? I MISS THIS SHOW! Got the 1/18 scale HotWheels Ultimate version Batmobile....My first ""College Costumes"" purchase in Oct. '66 was BATMAN! C'mon!"
5,"We want Eartha, uhm Batman!","Long time fans of the legendary Eartha Kitt-singer, actress & author-are eargely awaiting the opportunity to own this series so we may continue to bask in all that is Eartha, The Most Exciting Woman In The World."
2,When is this ever going to be released?,I have given up on this ever being available.I have signed up for the notification of when this comes available is that going to be any time soon
5,my first impression of batman,as a child the Batman TV series which by this time was running in syndication in the 70's was my opportunity to watch my favorite comic book hero come to life everyday at 4pm and I loved every minute of it.I really look forward to the day when this series becomes available on DVD.
5,Buyer Beware !,"Holy rip-off !!I have just bought a copy of the Batman TV Series for a ""bargain"" price of 11.99 from Nostalgia.co.uk . I strongly advise anyone to avoid this advertisment on Amazon at all costs ! Its a pirate copy and the quality is unwatchable . Wait patiently until the official series is released."
5,Batman-1966-DVD Series,"Well, I just read the reviews and as a preacher all I can say is -AMEN! I too grew up waiting to see what would happen when I tuned in to the ""Same bat time; Same bat Channel"". Other than the all to brief run on TV Land-I have been anxiously awaiting this series to be released. ""Let my people go!"""
4,Its Good!,"I like it. If you cant draw already this book really isnt going to help u any. If you lookin for some tips on sharpening up your skills or gettin into this style of comics, its cool. Has alot of good reference material. 1st book Ive ever bought by this author n wasnt dissapointed. I dig it."
5,Helpful,Book is very helpful in learning how to blend styles. Though for someone just beginning who does not know the two basic styles already I would suggest another book. Though if you already know American Comic styles and Manga this book is awesome.
4,"Great book, very helpful","I used to own this book when I lived in Connecticut and every time I drew, I would go back to it for reference. It would go through the differences between manga, fusion, and american style comic art. Unfortunately, I lost it during a move, but I would definately buy it again. Great drawing reference for both beginning and intermediate artists!"
3,This is Eleven's Best to date,"Eleven made a significant improvement from the ""Awake in a Dream"" album. While ""Awake"" had only about 4 smooth songs, this album has 7 strong songs with definite choruses. ""Reach Out"" stands out on this track. What keeps this album from achieving a 4-star rating is that Natasha sings on the other 3 songs. Natasha is a back-up vocal singer only and should keep it that way. Let Alain J. handle the lead vocals. Overall pretty good."
4,Edgy Treasure,"This CD is a little edgy treasure in a jewel case. Cherie and Marie's version of ""Since You've Been Gone"" is true rock and roll -- raw and full of energy.Sure, it's a cover; but it's BETTER than the original. We're talking Bad Girl Rock at its Baddest. We're talking ""Overnight Sensation."" We're talking ""This Time."" Listening to Messin' the Boys reminds me that there's a little bit of Bad Girl left in me. And that, my friends, is a GOOD thing!"
1,Huh? Wha?? I must've fallen asleep,What a boring CD...Not a single track is driven; this isn't rock and roll...It's the soundtrack to a seventies after school special...
1,Super Short Handle,"While the bag is gorgeous, better than in the photos, the handle is much shorter than in the photos. It CANNOT be used as a shoulder bag.I am, of course, returning it."
4,a great movie for those who love romance!,"The movie is great and very romantic, but it starts off slow and then gets you later on in the movie. I would recommed it."
4,great performance,"a great classic film with 2 great performers crosby & kelly.grace kelly refers to herself as a simple country girl; there'snothing simple about being married to an alcoholic who wants to convinceothers that his wife is the problem. despite grace's bitterness toward herhusband, deep down she truly loves him. this is proven by her refusingthe advances of william holden. I admire her loyalty to God's maritalarrangement when today,so many couples are quick to give up on afrustrated love & a troubled marriage.I would recommend this timeless classic to others"
4,LOVED THE FILM -,"LOVED THE FILM - CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE BROADWAY PLAY NOWTHO IT IS THE PLAY - NOT THE FILM -GREAT CAST MORGAN FREEMAN, FRANCES MCDORMAND & PETER GALLAGHERDIRECTED BY MIKE NICHOLSWRITTEN BY CLIFFORD ODETSSTARTS APRIL 3 AT JACOBS THEATER"
4,The Country Girl...,"Alright, here is my review... I saw this movie when I was much younger, and was not impressed. I didn't see it again untilI had aged a little and it was more appealing to me, but I still was not amazed... Then I found out that Grace Kelly won an Oscar for this, and thought she didn't deserve it. Then I found out she was nominated against Judy Garland and I was furious! But, I won't hold that against the movie. All in all, the movie was good. The script was so intruiging and the sets and costumes etc dazzled me. And I must give credit to the make up people for turning Gorgeous Grace Kelly into a plain(ish) woman... Even though I think Grace didn't deserve the Oscar (I believe Judy Garland did, for ""A Star is Born"") I still think it is a good movie. I recomend it..."
4,The UK in Afghanistan,This is a revealing read on Afghanistan in Victorian times and the problems and defeat the British Empire encountered. Gives one some background insight into why we and the UN are having the problems there today.
2,Wanted: A Groove of My Own,"This is not the worst album I've ever heard, but it is an album I have heard several hundred times before I actually popped it in my disc player. Jenny has a decent voice, and the backing tracks are professional, but Jenny is still lacking her own voice. Listen closely: There's a little Natalie Merchant there, a bit of Alanis there, and a sprinkle of Counting Crows over there. Her songs often follow the same patterns, and her vocal choices tend toward the gimmicky. Jenny has an excellent chance to evolve, but this album is sad evidence that she might be too busy following in others' footsteps to forge her own trail.Too bad."
4,A true pocket dictionary,"Very easy to carry in your pocket. Was great help on my recent trip to the Dominican Rep. Won't replace a large reference dictionary, but if you know your verb tenses, this might be all you need for general use. Uses American English and Lat. Am. Spanish."
3,The American Heritage Pocket Spanish Dictionary,"Nice hand size. But the print is too small, especially for an older person to read without eye strain."
2,NO WARRENTY ! Manufacturer ignores contact,"Absolutely love the product, BUT the manufacter DOES NOT STAND BEHIND the warrenty ! Product has 1 year warrenty, but the manufacter DOES NOT return emails, faxes, and you can't speak to anyone on the phone mailbox is always full.Just BEWARE! The product itself works pretty good and we were happy with it, but the de jamming handle broke, manufacter DOES NOT sell replacement parts.Keep in mind, I am speaking of Manufacter NOT seller of item. There is a difference."
1,Never worked,"Mangles paper, folded about three papers correctly other shredded, misfed, wrinkled mangled. Trash...."
5,Easy to use Paper Folder,We use this paper folder at the beginning of each month when we have to send out about 100 invoices. It is very fast and easy to use. We load up the invoices in batches of 30 and do not have any problems. It saves us at least an hour or so every month.
3,Keep an eyeon it,"Great machine, but you have to stay with it. Sometimes it grabs one than one sheet. Other than that, it is a great tool for the office. Just don't load it and walk away."
5,L O V E I T !!,"Length:: 1:34 MinsOk, so I went the cheap road last month and purchased a rather cheap sub-$100 Paper folder Sparco (SPR18726) and through a ream of paper, 1/3 folded. 1/3 destroyed and 1/3 paper airplaned (Folded incorrectly) and honestly I could have folded faster myself.Promptly Returned it and read a LOT of reviews for other folders before getting a 2nd. We went the Sub $200 route with this Techko folder and LOVE IT!THIS unit, has YET to mis-fold or eat a single page after 600+ sheets. ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! And FAST!We've put as many as 77 pages in top feeder and flawlessly took and folded every one. (Says it can handle max of 80)I shot a video of it in action in pictures area.Yes, it is a little loud, but in the back office, doesn't bother a soul up front."
4,Good but quirky,"This is definitely a low end machine. It works well for what it is. I took a stack of old copy paper, and tweaked the machine so that it folds the way we want it to. The rulers on the folding guide, are just that, a guide. We also make it a point to tighten the screws every time we use the machine. With that said, it does what it claims it will do. It folds paper and has only mangled one sheet in about 5000 run through the machine. We don't change the settings since all we do is fold 8.5x11 in half. It does what we need."
1,Constantly Jams,"The paper folder constantly jams and misfolds. It folds a paper in half just fine, but not into thirds. We mailed it back to the manufacturer for a replacement. The replacement constantly jams or misfolds just the same."
1,The Co will not provide parts that wear out,On their www site they are very proud that they will not provide any parts. There are some grabber pads that wear out from use. They would be cheap to provide. When they wear out - you will have to through out the machine.
1,Save your money!,"This product is JUNK!!! I bought it with plans to use it for about 600-700 mailers-one per year. NOT ANYMORE!! It wrecks 10-15% of the papers and it missfolds another 10%. NOT LESS THAN 10 OF EVERY 100 PAGES GETS THROWN AWAY!I emailed the seller (Sales Stores) about the problem 30 minutes after I received it because the problem started that soon. I have yet to hear back, it has been 4 days.I gave it one star because .25 is not an option."
2,He got paid to write this book?,I can't believe he was paid to write this book. The book is overly repeatative. Truthfully the book could be condensed into about 1/3 the size. The writer is obviously bias toward the Dell to the point that they slant all of the information and views.It does contain some usefull information. The good news is that it is so repeatative you should have the information memorized by the time you are through.
4,good deal,"quality product, good deal for price. great selection of color. the price was good for the qualtiy of the product."
4,Reeves Oil Paints,"I liked the oil paints, except the tubes were smallerthan I thought they would be, but you really don't needalot of paint on your pallete when using oils and they werenot that expensive considering all the tubes of color I got."
4,great,"great paint for the price, but very small bottles. Smaller than the picture looks. Just be aware when buying that it will only be good for a few paintings."
5,EXCELLENT,Grat product and fast delivery. I dont know why they have this listed as a toy......this should not be used by anyone under the age of 18 without supervision
3,Tweaker - 2 am Wake up call 5.1 mix DVD,MadCow's review is dead on. The sound quality is great. I would have liked a more aggressive use of the rear channels however the 5.1 mix is good. The whole DVD has a very chill vibe to it. The visuals are mellow and will not distract you from the music. The studio tour is a quality bonus feature. The whole package really works because the audio and visuals match each other in tone so well. Overall I would recommend it to any Tweaker fan or anyone into the dark fairy tale theme.
5,This book is great.,"I'm taking my first course in probability and the book used in this course is ""A first course in Probability""-Ross. This book is full of examples but the author doesn't explain the solutions to the difficult examples well...at all. I guess he assumes more ""mathematical maturity.""Anyway, I was lucky enough to find this book and it's wonderful. It basically covers the same material as Ross (no entirely) but the author takes the time to thoroughly explain the solutions. I'm thankful because I'm now getting more from my readings and this book is going to save me in my class. I have only read the first 6 chapters but I highly doubt the rest will be any different. The people who gave this book a bad review must not have any interest or desire to learn probability because that's all you need to learn from this book.The best math book I've ever read (not much competition, sadly). And at this price, come on! Definitely worth the $5!"
4,It's actually somewhat readable.,"This book is all right for a math book. Every time I forget something in probability, I can go back to this thing and find exactly what I'm looking for. I guess it could be more rigorous, but I think that would ruin it's understandability. It could definitely use more examples, but I say that about every book. I'm sure it contains its share of typos, but I'm so used to seeing typos in math texts I don't give them a second thought.This book can sure help you with figuring out how to compute odds in poker, so check it out."
1,Why do we care about probability. It never works............,"This blue book ""Fundementals of Probability"" is not very fundemental, this is one of the worse math text books I have ever seen. All probability books have same material but different author, This books dose not explain everything in detail and expect the beginers to know every single probability questions in advance, and there are lot of typo errors......"
4,De Grassi reworks Simon & Garfunkel,"Alex de Grassi does a superb job of capturing the unique sound of Simon & Garfunkel while adding his own New Age twist to this timeless music.The disc is haunting,uplifting and inspiring.The beauty of de Grassis'interpretation allows you to relax,anywhere,anytime to this wonderful music.My favorite time to listen to this disc is late on a Saturday afternoon alone, having a conversation with my wife.I hope if you purchase this disc you get great enjoyment from it as I have."
3,"Small correction - 1 Ghz, not 10.","Which would make it roughly half of the 'competitions' speed. Not bad, but certainly not a selling point."
3,IT'S WORTH WATCHING,"A GANG MEMBER [GLENN PLUMMER] ENDS UP IN JAIL FOR A DECADE. AFTER CHANGING HIS WAYS IN JAIL, HE GETS PAROLED AND NOW HE MUST STOP HIS SON FROM MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES HE MADE. NOT AS EFFECTIVE AS ''BOYZ N THE HOOD'' OR ''MENACE II SOCIETY', BUT IT'S AN OK HOOD MOVIE. GLENN PLUMMER DOES A GOOD JOB PORTRAYING THE REFORMED GANG MEMBER IN THIS MOVIE. IT'S WORTH A WATCH. FANS OF HOOD MOVIES SHOULD LIKE THIS."
5,Good movie!!,"This an excellent portrayal of a man, who wants to protect his family from the mean streets. He does a good job too!"
4,South Central refreshingly proves that convicts change.,"For once we actually see a convicted gangbanger reformed.South Central sucessfully shows how a neglected teen thrust into a life of gangs and drugs, is convicted and sent to prison, and there radically changed into a productive and caring father. It's a rarity to see something positive come out of these type of films so focused on the negative aspects. South Central successfully proves that if people want to change their lifestyle they can. A ""must see"" for all those wanna be ""hard"" folks, and those who think they can never change paths."
3,scarey life,Make u want to lock yo son in the house in make him read all day this movie is mind shocking terrible how life gets u in even more scarier when u have a baby by the wrong person in the wrong environment to ghetto people shouldn't be together
4,Great Movie - Not Just About Gangs,"I saw this movie years ago and what resonated with me more than anything was the portrayal of a man changing. When I saw the DVD for sale a while back, I just had to buy it for my clients. I use this movie as a tool for open discussion in cognitive groups as well as parenting groups. While the acting wouldn't be considered Oscar-worthy and some of the dialogue is sophmoric, the message of the movie far outweighs its flaws. Inspirational, powerful, and sometimes thrilling!"
2,Not what I expected.,"This book covers WSH 2.0. However, there was no subject matter on the XML format (wsf files) of WSH 2.0, covering includes, multiple scripting language support, etc. This book covered nothing but the Windows Scripting Host in VBScript format (vbs files) only. JScript was not included at all! JScript is easily translated from VBScript, however, this was still a setback of the book. A lot of emphasis was put on using COM objects, and calling these objects' data members via script. This is fine, but most of the functionality was written in Visual Basic -- again not what I expected. Scripting was made to write short, quick automated tasks, not to fire up Visual Basic and create a DLL every time you want to write a new script. The book is a decent reference, but not as good as Microsoft's free download. I would suggest getting this first. It does demonstate some examples of automating certain tasks, and shows some helpful tips and tricks."
5,Very practical - helped automate my daily work,"I put it to practical use quickly -- writing a script that helps me launch some favorite files and to find markers inside files.Its been mentioned that it is entirely VBScript and VB. There is no JavaScript. That was fine with me, but many others could be bothered by that.There is a not-too-detailed table of contents, and then a very detailed table of contents - great for finding things and reviewing.Also, each chapter begins with a list of topics to be covered. Each chapter ends with a concise but complete summary of what's been covered. They are both very helpful.That the entire book is on the CDROM is a bonus - making it the entire book searchable. (The CDROM also contains all of the code which is also obviously helpful).He explains things very well, sometimes evolving scripts through 3 or 4 editions, each one illustrating some new features and improvements."
3,Punky Pop- KD's beginnings,"I bought this album as huge fan of Kevin Devine's solo work. I don't think the album is anywhere near the high caliber of his solo albums, but I can appreciate his roots. I would have loved this album in middle school, but I can't say this one of my favorites at my age (21). I would say you should only buy this album if you are a die-hard KD fan, although some of the songs are pretty catchy regardless.Sorry if this is an unhelpful review. You should just listen to the samples."
5,Very nice change purse,I really like this change purse. It is made of soft leather and seems to be well made. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice solution to all the loose change we seem to accumulate. I've purchased from Beall's before and they have always reponded quickly to my orders and the products have always been of good quality.
4,Mundi Change Purse (Black),"Very nice purse, really like it. Only negative is that it could be a little smaller,"
4,Nice replacement,"The change purse I had, originally was falling apart. This change-holder took the same functionality and provides a roomy, yet compact holder."
1,everything the seller promised BUT.....,This book was everything the seller promised but it fails miserably as a Machinists Reference book. There is no table of contents and it is VERY difficult and time consuming to find what you might be looking for. I would recommend the seller of this book to any and everyone BUT the book itself is almost worthless.
2,Looks like discontinued merchandise,You get what you pay for with this one. We have thrown several away because the cheese bags were broken or leaked slightly. Looks like the Kraft leftovers and we'll not buy them again. Gave it 2 stars because it does taste good and you can add lots of extra pasta for a main course because there's plenty of cheese.
3,Hope you don't like broccoli much,"I knew that only a small amount of broccoli would be included and obviously in dried form. Even so, I was disappointed with the tiny particles of broccoli debris. They come wrapped in a dark green plastic pouch to help prevent you from noticing until the moment you dump them into the boiling water.The next disappointment came when it was time to drain the boiled pasta and broccoli. Unless you've got a colander made from fine mesh like a tea strainer, you're going to lose a lot of the broccoli specks while draining. The alternative is to try skimming the water out instead of draining it completely, but you will end up with soupy, diluted cheese. This probably isn't too bad an idea if you prefer milder cheese flavor like me because the white cheddar cheese sauce was stronger than I expected.Other than the draining challenge, the product was quick and easy to prepare, and a reasonable value."
3,I got mine autographed!,"This is a straight forward album of contemplative music (mostly ballads) by actor Bill Mumy. Bill plays every instrument and sings all the notes. Very professionally done, and a good listen, if you're in the right frame of mind. And he's a heck of a nice guy, too!"
2,"Poor, vulgar and violent",A no go for me and for a friend who co-starred in it later to find the poor taste in it all.
5,Terrific!,"This resource is the best I've seen in my 20+ years of counseling. And this is the third copy I have purchased. They keep disappearing! It is both practical and inspiring, helping folks to take an honest look without beingthreatening. I've seen it make marriages better!"
2,Great Self analysis,I read this book after I went through a nasty divorce and felt intimidated and humiliated. I learned a great deal about myself and I think this book should be recommended by every psychologist who has people with poor self esteem issues due to dysfunctional relationships. I felt the book was all about me.I give this book a 10
3,"Informative, but not entertaining","They make a few jokes, but most of the time it's only documentary. Nothing like Bill Nye the Science Guy. Less interesting, I think, than Greatest Discoveries, hosted by Bill Nye. I would recommend watching those before considering this."
4,On my turntable in '79.,"Nice little band from 1977-1983. This debut was a great rocking' album in the throws of disco. Great tracks like ""Hello, Hello, Hello"", the top 40 classic ""Don't Ever Wanna Lose Ya"" #40 just great licks here, with great sounding keyboards. ""P.U.N.K."" (Puny Undernourished Kid) a song that should of been on everybody's playlist back in 1979, but wasn't. ""Shoot"" and ""The Last Show"" were also great songs. This album should of been a million seller, but the record label just didn't back them up. A great lost album of good Rock 'N Roll!"
1,Keep Lookin!,"One listen to this and you wont wonder why New England never made it big. I have ""Explorer Suit"" on cassette and its not any better."
2,Another Rip-Off,"Viewers beware, this is just a bad imitation from the original Korean blockbuster - ""Old Boy""."
5,Beautiful and Inspiring,"This book is not for those looking for biographical information -- although Father John Dear does include some biographical details about the lives of those included. Rather, this book is for those who want to reflect on the examples of nonviolence that these individuals provided with their lives. Simply written, beautifully illustrated with icons, this book is very much a devotional work -- one that reminds us how to reflect God's love into the world."
2,Ultimate Pinball,Purchased from Amazon.Ultimate PinballWouldn't work on my computer. It refused to load and it hosed up my PC. I had to reset a lot of my PC settings. I have vista premium & usually XP software will work on vista. Just not this time.
4,Aboriginal Funk!,"This is a cd worth picking up. Lots of good cuts on this gem. Along with the 13 Yothu Yindi band members {from the Yolngu -Aboriginal- homelands on the ne coast of Australia} they are supported on this disc by Neil Finn (ex-Crowded House and Split Enz), Bill Lasswell and Bernie Worrell, among others.My faves on this album: Timeless Land, Back to Culture, Yolngu Boy and Dots on the Shells."
4,A really good first effort,"I have only recently gotten this album and it's a strong effort. It leans more towards the country side of country rock and reminds me more of Poco than the Eagles. I've read quite a few PPL reviews that belabor the absence of Craig Fuller on the later PPL albums, but my favorite PPL album is the Fuller-less ""Two Lane Highway"". If you have never listened to PPL, that would be a wonderful place to start. All in all, if you dig the Fuller era PPL stuff, you will probably not like the later stuff after he left and vice versa. This album is good but it's not as good as ""Two Lane Highway""."
2,Took Me All Summer to Read........,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a Clinton supporter, I voted for him twice and thought I would really enjoy this book. It started out great--nice down-to-earth writing style, interesting anecdotes, really enjoyable read. But then it degenerated into....politics, which I suppose I should have been prepared for. In that sense, it is a great book for historians. I wanted to read about the personal side of the man, not about who he appointed to every post and who did every last job on each and every one of his campaigns. I won't be reading The Presidential Years--this one actually did take me all summer to read because it was so boring. Two stars is a little harsh, but at least I can say that I finished it. Sorry, Bill."
4,Intriguing,"Even though I had the chance to live through the years that Bill Clinton was president, I cannot believe how much of the Clinton years I had forgotten. Bill has a great sense of humor and is a great storyteller with compassion, grace and style. He is one of my favorite presidents of all time. A great read. It made me want to know more about his early years growing up in Arkansas."
4,An interesting look at a complicated man,As someone who has written a lot on Bill Clinton I eagerly awaited the release of his biography. It met most of my expectations although at times he put in far more than I needed to or cared to know. Nigel Hamilton does an excellent job in his early years biography and it matches most of what Clinton talks about here. The need for Bill Clinton to please everyone around him really comes out in his own biography and while I feel he skirts around his disagreement with Carter and does not express the anger that most sources say he felt it is a very honest attempt. I would have liked more details about his college years and meeting Hillary which he jumps past fairly quickly and gets into their political relationship. It is very well written which is to be expected from someone as educated as Bill Clinton.
1,Accidentally accurate,"I believe this book almost perfectly captures the essence of the Clinton administration.It is full of lies and half truths, lazy in its lack of organization, self indulgent, self serving- a perfect recap. Clinton took the advance money, and then didn't bother to write the book. How typical of his presidency, where he won the election then didn't bother to be president.Of course, what could Bill talk about if forced to discuss his presidency? After the first few months, it was 7 years of illegal fund raisers and skirt chasing. He's not going to write about that! Or should he write about how Newt Gingrich took his presidency from him? Or, about staffing the White House with prostitutes at tax payer expense?With so many things off limits, the 1100 pages are divided up about like this:300 pages about his weight700 pages of fact free filler100 pages of feeling sorry for himself.BTW: any reviewer who says they liked this did not actually read it."
1,most overrated film of last year,"This movie is garbage. Pure unadulterated garbage. Nothing original or groundbreaking here. This is just another attempt by Hollywood to dumb down a far superior foreign film for American audiences. This movie is neither scary nor suspenseful. Ringing telephones and shots from behind just does'nt cut it. Quick edits of so called ""disturbing"" images does not make up for the lack of plot or character development. Verbinski's talents were much better displayed in Mouse Hunt. The five minute dream sequence, with images by Salvador Dali, in Hitchcock's Spellbound were better than anything in this 90-minute movie. If you like Naomi Watts in scream mode watch Mulholland Drive by David Lynch instead. Then watch Roman Polanski's Repulsion."
2,Shallow,"Loren, Perkins, and company reduce one of the American Theatre's masterworks to overwrought trivia in this lifeless adaptation of the Eugene O'Neil classic. Given the obvious talent of the cast, one expects considerably more--and although the basic story of a wife who betrays her much older husband with her step-son remains more or less intact, the film version entirely misses the spirit of the original. Those who have not seen nor read the original may find the film entertaining as soap-opera; those familiar with the original, however, will be outraged."
3,Depressing,"The cast was very good and I was intrigued enough by the story to keep watching, although I feared that something by Eugene O'Neill might be a little darker than what I was looking for. The chemistry between Loren and Perkins was good and after a while I thought that her statement that they were very lucky people might bring some sunlight into this film. Wrong.I'm not saying that O'Neill wasn't a great playwright but the plot twist in the end didn't make sense to me. It wasn't just that this didn't have a happy Hollywood ending, it seemed unrealistic and that's what made the conclusion so horrible. Without giving it away, I'll just say that the ending made sitting through the whole two hours a waste of time.See it if you must but don't say you weren't warned."
1,Wrongly Named Book,"This book has the wrong title. The author devotes a whole chapter to why he gave it the wrong title and also spends a lot of time hammering competitive authors with bad reviews to sell his own products. I personally don't trust a book with the wrong title, especially when a whole chapter needs to be written to explain this innaccuracy. It's also sad that the author finds time and enjoyment in slandering, slaughtering and playing down the works of his competitors. Then again, this behavior is greatly promoted by Munoz himself as well as other Axis and Feldgrau website forum mebers."
2,Wrong title,"The value of the book is immediately diminished by its title. This book is about Belarus. Yet the authors refer to it as ""White Russia"". This is a type of mistake that can be made by people who are not familiar neither with the history of the region nor with the enthography and geography of Eastern Europe. Belarus does not mean ""White Russia"". It means White Ruthenia. The words ""White Russia"" were used only by Russian empire historians in order to justify their occupation. How can I even consider buying a book which has a wrong name for its main subjects?"
2,poorly written biography of elegant author,"Meyers seems to have his facts right, but what a contrast between this clumsily written biography and Maugham's own prose. The biographer is both tone-deaf and condescending towards his subject. Maybe growing up in New York City is a handicap when it comes to understanding the European fin-de-siecle spirit.Example: on p. 19 Meyers writes that the child was not 'cunning' enough to avoid mockery and humiliation an King's School. Pardon me: Willie Maugham had a strong French accent, was small for his age and very shy and to top it off was afflicted with a very bad stammer. Understandably, Maugham suffered from this experience for the rest of his life. What a sad story.And why describe his mother's guests as ""lady friends invited for tea and gossip""? I get the feeling that Meyers simply doesn't like his subject. Here's hoping that the book improves; but so far it simply seems to need a good edit all the way through."
3,A very well researched biography of a frenetic life,"How I came upon this book is a story in itself. I am involved in collecting then sending things to our church adopted military unit. We had so very many books that all of them could not be sent at once. So, I had a box full of them sitting in my closet. Going through the box one day, I pulled this book to read even though I knew very little of W.S. Maugham. It was the only biography in the box.Rating a biography is difficult because it is not a matter of liking or disliking how a story plays out. I rated this 3 stars only because I found too much pronoun confusion and a little bit of chronological confusion. Despite this, the book is fantastically well researched. Since Maugham lived nearly 92 frenetic years, there is a lot of material. It had to be quite a task to decide what to include in the book and Jeffrey Meyers did a wonderful job determining what to and not to relate to his readers."
4,One of the Most Relaxing CD's ever!,This CD is amazing! Its Beatles gone lounge music/jazz. I would recommend this CD to everyone. It's the perfect CD to listen to when your studying or just relaxing. A very peaceful and quite enjoyable CD.
4,Huge New Age + Beetles fan,How could one not like this combination. Have other interpretations and this one is quite good. Fits well with my collection.
4,My soul to keep,"Grant Lewis, Jr. does a beautiful job in his debut novel, Three Seeds of Eve. Three women who have never met, but upon meeting KNOW they've met prior? Sniff the intrigue in the air...and Grant brings it! I love how he deals with present life and then takes us wwwwaaaayyyyyy back to show us that what we are doing now is pretty much what we've always done throughout time. Like the old saying: Same stuff, different place. My hat goes off to this complex writer. I cannot wait to read his next one!"
4,great for study of longitude and latitude,"This story is great for a ""challenge"" lesson about longitude and latitude. It's another example of how thinking outside of the box with math/science helped to solve a problem. Kids enjoy this story, but it's maybe a little better suited to kids who have a strong understanding of time, distance, and travel of another era. Gifted children may find it interesting."
2,defective?,"I don't quite know what to make of it. The bulb fits in my lamp, the circuit closes (I can hear a pop from some nearby speakers), but there's no light. I won't bother filing a claim with Amazon for a couple of bucks, but I felt I should share my experience with prospective buyers."
2,Sure didn't last long,I ordered this for a desk lamp that I use about 15 - 20 hours per week. I couldn't believe that it only lasted a few months! So I am back online now ordering a different brand. I bet it lasted me about 250 - 300 hours tops.
4,Sylvania 12-volt bulb,bulb worked fine. Be sure not to handle with your bare hands. Remember the bulb gets very hot! The price was a bit high since you can get 10 of the frosted version of this same bulb from amazon for around $10.
3,they are lights,"what can i say, you hit the switch and they turn on, light helps me see when it is dark. they don't seem to last very long."
1,Packaging Nightmare,"I've bought these lamps in bulk before, I have about 15 fixtures in my house that take these lamps, the lamps last for years, so I don't have to buy very often. For this order I purchased ten thinking each one would come in it's own little cardboard box. Wrong! Each one was in a piece of plastic that was attached to a large cardboard card and then individually enclosed in a large heavy plastic bag. Ridiculous, wasteful, stupid packaging. Amazon,please, please, give some indication of how things are packaged. This item has several part numbers, I could not tell what, if any, the difference is, maybe it's packaging? Packaging influences my purchasing decisions, it doesn't take much to be smart about it. Help me out........"
2,sonic darts,okay tehse are not sonic darts this are suction cup micro darts there the reloads for the firely but becus ethey dint sell well tehre almost gone from the marketif you find some buy them if not too bad buy regs
1,Good Customer Service,"While I was sent the wrong item, the associate with whom I communicated was wonderfully helpful and courteous. I will keep them in mind for future purchases."
2,where's the noise?,"we got these darts for xmas along with two maverick nerf guns. based on the name sonic darts I expected a nice whistling sound. On a few shots I can hear a very faint whistle. there is a small hole on the rubber tip which is supposed to create sound. perhaps they work better with more high powered nerf guns, but with the maverick I was not impressed. the kids had much more fun with the suction cup darts. also the sonic darts seemed more prone to jamming in the gun.oh well - lesson learned!"
2,Still buggy after firmware upgrade,"I purchased a Rino520 to use with a Rino530. Several times, the screen would blank out after pushing the ""push to talk"" (PTT) button when using the radio. The screen would recover after turning off the unit, however, it would blank out again after pushing the PTT button. In order to temporarily provide a more ""long-term"" solution, I had to disconnect the battery to power down the unit. After doing that, the screen would still blank out intermittently, but not with almost every push of the PTT button. Even with the screen blank out, the radio would still function, but then one is left with an expensive two-way radio.I'm much happier using a GPS60CSx and a pair of Motorola Talkabouts. My Rino's have been such a headache. The convenience of being able to communicate location to another Rino user while out in the wilderness is a great idea. I still anticipate owning a pair of Rino's in the future. However, I'm waiting until Garmin improves their quality control."

3,Comforting Rhyming Story,"I bought this book because both of my children loved reading another book by the same author called, ""This is the Bear"". In comparison to this is the bear, this book is not as good. The illustrations are in full color and well done as in the other book, but the story is not as cute. Young children adore the gentle text and will soon be reciting the story along with you. This book will appeal greatly to toddlers and preschool children. It makes a wonderful quick read before bedtime."
3,Good compact guide to cars for the clueless...,"with good advice and checklists for any car. Some of it was a little confusing though...ie: how to handle stopping in traffic with a standard transmission...I won't get into it here. She is good at pointing out where things are, but the book lacks enough illustrations. The lingo used is kept to a minumum (most needed words/phrases are given) but more help here also would have been good. The glossary is okay, but not great."
5,Put this book in your glove compartment!,"Small, cheap, and to the point! This book is excellent when it comes to basic car maintanence! I love the fact that this book assumes nothing from it's readers. Ms. Volpe should write college textbooks! I mean it when I say this: do not buy any other beginner books about cars! They will be wordy and technical! If your favorite bookstore does not have ""The Lady Mechanic"", place in a special order for it!"
3,Not very thorough,"I much prefer a down to earth approach. This would have been a great book if it had just been written with the truely clueless in mind. The title got me to purchase it, but I didn't find it nearly as helpful as ""Lucille's Car Care""."
2,Where's the rest of the telecast?,"The musical excerpts on this DVD of Ethel Merman and Mary Martin are nice. But, for $18, I'd like more than 27 minutes of excerpts from a historic 1953 telecast that likely was one-to-two hours in length. If these musical excerpts survive, I suspect the remainder of the telecast (including other guest stars, dialog, opening and closing credits, etc.) likely survive too, and the entire program is what I assumed I would be getting when I purchased this DVD. In the past, I have purchased other vintage TV variety programs on DVD only to discover that the programs had been edited (in the case of The Milton Berle Collection, the musical numbers performed by guest stars have been deleted from the 10 shows in the collection). I don't understand why. In these times of wanting to restore movies to their original released version and including extra material and/or cut scenes, why should we have to settle for 27 minutes of ""highlights"" from a historic telecast?"
5,The Lengendary Duet,"I saw this duet live on television when I was 12 years old. It was the most thrilling thing I had ever seen on television. I bought the record album and wore it out. It is absolutely thrilling that it has finally been released on DVD. Whatever the cost of the DVD, it is priceless."
4,"A bet, a but, a beware, a better","As a record collector in Canada, I was not the first to fall on the 10 inches 33 rpm record of this show, buying it and listening to it over and over. Did I dream of seeing it? You bet! It is a real treasure and what fun camaraderie passes between Merman & Martin!BUT, for Canada buyers: BEWARE of stores who sells this short DVD at 54$! It was much less expensive to buy it here + shipping!DVD is short? It is not complete? It is much better than only hearing it!! Please, were lucky to have it anyway! There is more than the record itself (don't miss Martin's sketch on fashion passing fancies !!! Delightful!). Just imagine if the film itself had been destroyed? Just imagine all the great stuff that has not been kept through time?Let's enjoy what we have!"
2,POOR SELECTIONS OF GREAT TALENT OFFERINGS,"For those who recall the great talents possessed by Martin and Merman, thess selections from the old TV special offer only brief snippets of their old standards. A lot of footage is wasted on Mary going through a series of costume poses spoofing fashions of sixty years ago. How much of her great vocalizing could have been provided instead! Although we are treated to Ethel belting out several of the old songs that only she could do justice to, I got the feeling that Mary got the short shrift. And more interaction between the two could have made a great improvement."
1,I'll never know if it works or not,"The company ""substituted"" some other product (without my consent), claiming it was an upgrade. Untrue, given I could have bought their ""substitute"" for $10 less elsewhere (including shipping)."
1,"Warning: VERY SHORT VERSION ""Based On"" THE ORIGINAL","I am not at all happy to realize too late that this is a very, very, very short version ""based on the original"" work. This is not what I thought I was getting; the description should make this more obvious (I wish I'd read more of the reviews, which would've alerted me, but I shouldn't have to do that). Cute product and sturdily made, but NOT the tried and true classic I was expecting."
3,Needs a little more text..,"This is a very cute book but... It ends very abruptly and is not quite long enough for my 1 and a half year old. She loves trying to count the fish on top, and trying to say the color names, but just a few more pages would have made this book a lot better."
1,Disappointed,"The book is far short of original text, not interesting enough to hold attention. I would not recommend it."
2,NOT the Original!! ... Plus Sharp Corner!,"MOST IMPORTANT: The top of this book has a very sharp corner! It really can poke an eye out! The bottom one is rounded and fine. It says ""Safety Tested for Children of All Ages."" I don't see how this could be, because it's truly sharp!I recently bought a board book ""Mr. Brown Can Moo! Can You? (Bright and Early Books for Beginning Beginners)""http://www.amazon.com/Brown-Bright-Early-Beginning-Beginners/dp/0394806220/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1352940080&sr;=8-1&keywords;=mr+brown+can+moo+can+you+board+bookand thought this book was the same type of thing, I should have read these reviews instead of purchasing so quickly! Note the review that includes the text, this version completely lacks the fun rhythm of the original. I made a big mistake buying this, so make sure YOU know what you're getting here. Sure the beads are nice but aren't enough.Overall, LAME! But my own fault."
2,Kinda lame,"I was hoping this would be more like the actually Dr. Seuss book, its not. Its probably about 6 or 7 lines and the last one is totally ridiculous, it doesn't even rhyme. I'd have been better off just buying to real book and reading it to my son. But the boardbooks are so nice because I can give it to him and not worry about him ripping pages out. I think the REAL Dr. Seuss books are a must have but not this thing or anything like it."
5,Wounderful Read!,"My daughter really loved this book. We challange you to:See the book, buy the book, read the book, share the book!You wont regret it"
2,Counting beads are great! Adaptation is poorly written.,"The colorful counting beads are fun for babies to play with/learn to count/learn colors. However, the adaptation of the book ""One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish"" was done very poorly. The rhymes in this book are forced and lacks the natural rhythm of usual limericks/poems. As previous reviewers have said, the text is unusually short. I understand that the goal of the book is to provide a Seussian counting book, but they really could have tried a little harder when putting this together. Here is the the text for those of you who would like to know:""One fishtwo fish/red fishblue fish./Black fishblue fish/old fishnew fish./Three fishfour fish./Here come more fish!/This one has a little star./Say! What a lot of fish there are./1 One fish2 two fish3 three4 four5 five./This one has a car to drive![end]"
4,"Great cd, hard to find in stores!","This is a great 80's album and very hard to find in any stores. I just got done listening to it and did not think it sounded as bad as some reviews are saying. However, my audio in the car and at home is not what I would consider high end. It does sound a little flat and not much bass but not enough to really bother me since I listen to music mainly at a low-med volume. I find that typical though of alot of older music reissued on cd's. I think though for them having it available on cd and at this cheap of a price, you cannot go wrong."
4,Red 7,"If you want to be taken back to the 80's where everyone copied Miami Vice particularly Don Johnson as Crocket, The first track should do it for you. Heartbeat by Red 7 was used in an episode of the iconic show. So slide it into the disc slot, sit back relax and put on your Ray Bands and drift back to a time when more was more and every thing was neon."
4,Great for kids,"Very interesting book. Even though it's aimed at kids, I thouroughly enjoyed it. It's the perfect length for a child. The way E. Nesbit combines history with storytelling works so well that I find myself remembering historical facts from the book. I would definitely recommend this for any child and any grown-up who enjoys children's books."
3,Street Preacher Review,"There are no Gospel tracts for Jews to be found here, and I recommend the book of Hebrews (and many other Books of the Bible, like Isaiah) over this book, for dialoging with Jews."
4,great film noir - not enough Lake!,"A classic piece of ""film noir"" - with superb give-and-take between Ladd and Lake (who doesn't have nearly enough screen time!). The plot has ""more twists than a pretzel"" and delivers in keeping the viewers attention."
3,"Good, tough 1946 film noir.","This is one of Ladd's better films with an original screenplay by Raymond Chandler. Ladd is on the run after his faithless wife has been murdered and he is a prime suspect. The original killer was supposed to have been William Bendix, a veteran with a plate in his head, but military officials objected to a war veteran being made the""heavy"". This not a grade A Chandler effort-- the mystery and the solution do not stay in the mind as much as the atmosphere that is created--that of post-war cynicism and malaise and this atmosphere is the film's strongest asset."
2,"Stylish, but not genuine noir","The opening shot may be one of the most knowing and beautiful ones in film noir, a focus on the word 'Hollywood' which after the camera pulls away, is actually a destination on a bus sign. With fiml noir, just utter ""Hollywood"" and there is no need to explain betrayal, hypocrisy, seediness, injustice or pretence.The screenplay is classic Raymond Chandler, sharply brilliant with rat-a-tat fire exchange. But the plot fails -- it's too simple, too linear, and not convuluted enough to darken the shadows and reflect the torn morals noir characters have to face. Veronica Lake as the femme fatale isn't quite vicious enough, and her own private agenda is boring enough to bleach white into the noir. In fact, that credit should go to man-caught-in-the-middle Johnny Morrison's (Alan Ladd) ex-wife, who goes out of her way to make a war hero look bad."
2,Sisterland,"I thought I would like this book. I was obviously wrong, because I was so bored I couldn't even read any more after I got past like, page 50. And that's saying something, because every time I pick up a book I just HAVE to finish it. But this was the one time I honestly couldn't read it.The reason I gave it two stars was because it might be a good book, but I just couldn't take the time to finish it."
3,Big 80s Keyboard Rock,"The album Steel Breeze, by the band Steel Breeze is all up tempo. There are no ballads here. This is what I call a ""convertible album."" It is perfect for top down driving, stereo blasting and taking on a twisty road. The band's sound is almost the feel of the early 80's arena rock, but the sound is not too big or overblown. Steel Breeze's most known song, `You Don't Want Me Anymore' starts the album off with a classic `80s keyboard fanfare. This sets the tone for the whole album. While you won't find anymore commercial hits here, there still some very solid songs. The last track, Street Talknin' is an interesting diversion. It has a slight calypso feel to it."
4,Great 80's cheese,"This really is a good album, although it is kind of dated. But if you liked 80s new wave rock, it's for you. One thing no one has mentioned is that there is some fantastic guitar playing on this album. I'm talking hot leads that would rank up there with Eddie Van Halen or early Malmsteen as far as technique. Particularly on ""Lost in the 80's""."
4,An encourging book,"This book is not particularly designed to help you feel good but to instruct you to feel good. I know when I read it that I came up short in that detachment of spirit and absolute charity towards our neighbor which characterizes the friends of God.However, this book does have enough practical advice, examples and exhortations to encourage you to live out evangelical poverty in all states of life so that we might obtain the Kingdom of heaven.My one problem with the book was at times it became very repetitive. Chasity and Obedience tend to be more focused on than the necessity of poverty and this book should balance out any serious Catholic who is well read on the other evangelical counsels."
5,Great book,Great book. It really challenges you to examine your lifestyle and compare to the lifestyle that Christ and his Apostles call us to in the New Testament. A good book for anyone who is seeking to live the Gospel life.
5,Radical and Challenging,Anyone who is striving to become a saint must read this book. Fr. Dubay does an excellent job of explaining why all Christians should embrace the call of poverty according to their state in life. This applies to everyone though it will of course look different if you are a nun or if you are married. This book is not for the faint of heart. It will challenge you to the core. It lays the foundation as to why we must live this out and at the same time is very practical. This book should be read with a docile heart and be reflected upon in prayer.
3,Work great; taste terrible!,I can usually stand to eat anything but these are bad. I eat them anyway because glucosamine changed my life. I work out alot and was starting to feel it in my knees...started taking glucosamine and it made me feel as young as I should feel. So...the only way i would recommend these is if you cannot swollow a pill.
3,not the best book i've read,"In this book the heroine, Rebecca, and her sister travel to England,but get intercepted by a pirate called the Raven. Well let's see;what could happen next? I wonder. Could Rebecca fall in love with the Raven? Of course she does. They all do. What this author needs to do is put some mystery into the story, like in pride and predjdice. This is why I can only give this book three stars."
2,almost sounds like someone trying,"to fake the style of Queen badly. those familiar with the ""classic sound"" will be expecting much that is absent in these early recordings: the famous layered harmonies of both vocals and guitar, the strong rhythem section, and so forth. the production is barren and tinny, sounding like a 'generic' an imediately forgettable early 70's pop act for the most part. there are only two originals, the rest are cover tunes. and there are some of the worst vocals, for Queen especially, on ""Polar Bear"". for completelists only!"
3,for rarities collectors,"This is for queen completists only. It's rare tracks from prequeen and early queen stuff , most of it sounds pretty good but some is less than stellar. ""april lady' is a fantastic song and makes the whole deal worth it though it's a fantastic song. I am glad this is available and now there's a new boxset with tons of queen rarities coming out soon."
4,Queen In Nuce,"I really liked the album, I bought it over the internet. About the songs, they have good quality, and it has good songs like I can hear music, Going back, Mad the swine, etc. I would really recommend this album to you."
3,There is something better.,Look for a album called Queen Pre-Ordained. It has all these song plus about 5 more.
2,"Queen in Nuce, or better yet, noose.","I am probably one of the biggest Queen fans, so naturally, I had to see where it all started out, with the pre-Queen band Smile. Wow, I wish I hadn't. It has a few good points, such as a cover of Dusty Springfeild's ""Going Back"", ""Mad the Swine, which was the first song they recorded together as Queen, and the very popish and catchy ""Step on Me."" But the rest is blah. It sounds like it was tape recorded straight from an already scratchy LP. And I don't even have to mention the overall mix of the recording flat out stinks. So if you're a person trying to get into Queen, avoid this like the plague. If you're already a Queen fan, but not very big, I wouldn't suggest it to you either, just because it lacks that Queen essence. If you're a Queen maniac, and a completionist, get it. It may not be a great album, but it is interesting to see what they evolved from."
3,Outsourcing: The Smart Explanation,"Outsourcing is a trend that's not going away, at least not as long as companies can save money by hiring other companies to manage some parts of their business, even as they continue to perform their core competencies. This book focuses on the reasons and rules of outsourcing. According to authors Thomas M. Koulopoulos and Tom Roloff, many companies aren't taking the right approach to outsourcing and, therefore, are not realizing its full benefits. The book covers a complex topic and, though it sometimes gets too technical, it will help you take a hard, honest competitive look at your outsourcing strategy, diagnose its gaps and improve the way you outsource. We believe executives and managers should read this book to learn how intelligent outsourcing can help their companies save money, innovate and compete."
1,never received,tried to order as a Christmas present product never showed up. had to go elsewhere to get item very disappointed because i had to spend more money than I originally wanted to. I will never order from this company again. excuse was may have gotten lost in the mail
1,Low quality MS Powerpoint slide pack. Complete ripoff,"This product is a complete ripoff. It is nothing more than a MS powerpoint presentation with photographs cut and pasted into the slides.The CD is labeled with a plain white label in a poorly selected font. The CD box cover is an injet print out that was cut from a regular sheet of printer paper, which wasn't even cut properly. You can even see the ragged edge of the tear.Text explainations are poor if any. It reminds me of a powerpoint presentation that any high school student might put together for class.If you're looking for a multimedia CD look elsewhere."
5,"Exellent, only a bit '80s...","This CD is great and should not be missed by any Queen/Freddie Mercury fan. Freddie's mesmerizing voice could make even Spice Girls songs worth a listen... These songs, however, are very, very good, only there is that eighties sound that some of us (me included) loathe. Still, Freddie is the best..."
5,elin baykal,"I think queen is the best music group in the world.it's fame come from turkey too.espessially Freddie mercury,roger taylor,brain may are the best ones.but it was so bad luck for this group to freddie's die.but his songs are still listening.but queen is still living and freddie is too..."
5,"Gone, but never EVER forgotten..","Thank you Freddie, for what you have done for me....I will never forget you my friend, ever..."
5,"Least interesting version of FM's work, but BUY IT ANYWAY!","If you love FM, then you should own this CD, despite the fact that Hollywood records took an ABSOLUTELY AMAZING ALBUM, ""The Freddie Mercury Album"" and made it into a much weaker, commercial version of what was the only true solo work of the great FM (""Mr. Bad Guy"" is aside...first of, this CD is impossible to find, and secondly it literary sounds like FM was partying much more than working in the studio, while making ""Mr.Bad Guy""). What I LIKE ABOUT ""THE GREAT PRETEDER"" is the techno remix of ""Living on My Own"" (12TH TRACK, THAT IS NOT MENTIONED ON THE LIST OF TRACKS), that can only be found on this CD. So, if for no other reason, then, buy this CD, just to have an extra remix of this song, if you love it as much as I do."
4,Too real,"This is a compilation album of Freddie Mercury solo material. Six of the songs are from hisMr. Bad Guyalbum, two are from Dave Clark's musicalTime, two are from movie soundtracks, and there is one other song which, I believe, is an outtake from theBarcelonasessions. The songs on this CD have been remixed. I have never heard the original mixes of these songs, so I can only judge them based on how they sound here. Well, they sound pretty good to me. I enjoyed all the songs here, some more than others, of course. If you are a fan of Queen, you will probably enjoy this CD, too."
4,Judy Garland meets Hendrix,"Freddy always said that his 2 biggest influences were Judy Garland and Hendrix, and those influences are really apparent here. Listening to 'Your Kind Of Lover' and 'Great Pretender' is a bit like having a front row seat in a cabaret in the Twilight Zone. But in a good way. Generally gone is the Queen sound. What's left is Mr. Bad Guy's heart on his sleeve and a slight scent of cheese in the air. But in a good way. With Freddy, it was always good. Just kind of goofy. But in a good way."
4,An interesting sampling of Mercury's solo work,"Another compilation of Freddie Mercury's solo work , including his magnifficent reworking of The Platters hit The Great Pretender , the offbeat Foolin' Around and Living On My Own , the funky Your Kind Of Lover and Let's Turn It On , the bold Living On My Own and my personal favourite among Mercury solo Hits , Love Kills.An interesting sampling of Mercury's solo work."
3,Hmmmmmm,"I would like to say I enjoy this album immensely, I am a big fan of Freddie Mercury but this album overlooks many of his solo songs of sheer briliance and focusses largly on lame covers and Freddies synth led dance/disco material. Foolin Around and Your Kind Of Lover sound like outtakes from the highly overrated Dance Floor/Acid Jazz Queen travesty Hot Space. Still theres some great stuff with Excercises In Free Love, Mr. Bad Guy, My Love Is Dangerous and Love Kills. These show Freddies songwriting at its best and elevate the album from the dreck and theres no deneing through even the worst parts of this album the former member of Wreckage is in fine form vocally and his piano although very minimal is also great."
2,Poor design,"Bought this for our 4 year old last year. The wings for the Pegasus are brittle and fall out easily. The Barbie doll doesn't sit well on the Pegasus. My little girl has to use to both hands to keep the doll on the horse. Most importantly, she doesn't play with it all that much."
4,Gah..Another Time life book,"I bought too many of these, because clearly I like them. Good for beginners and stuff."
5,North Korea: How We Got Here? Where Do We Go?,"In an expansion upon his earlier works in U.S.-China relations, this latest by William C. Triplett II is an unflinching examination of North Korea. Triplett uses his skill as historian and political analyst to present an insightful inspection of the North Korean crisis, the Chinese nexus and policy prospects for future engagement. Triplett deftly weaves the complex issues of communism, weapons proliferation, drug trafficking, terrorism, the U.N. and political theory into a single work with clear prose and cogent reduction. This book is an excellent choice for those who would like to become well informed on the crises and controversies surrounding Kim Jung Il and his father Kim Il Sung. Likewise, the thorough analyses of political missteps and contemporary hypotheses for future engagement, make this a must read for any who wish to remain abreast of the latest political theory on communist Asia."
3,No precisava ser to caro,"Comprei esse livro pra dar de presente para a minha mulher. No entendi como um livro com um papel to vagabundo, ilustraes to pouco nÃ­tidas e encadernao to porca pode custar to caro... quanto ao conteÃºdo, no tenho a menor idÃ©ia. As 3 estrelas so pelo preo vs. qualidade da edio."
5,Vey good starter kit,im just now learning the way of tarot...and this kit is really helpful although i do like the Rider deck better then the other one that came with... this is a great starter kit if your just learning its very helful in many ways...tells you meaning of cards how to set them up etc...and even comes with a personal journal...5 stars
4,This a nice starter deck.,This is a nice starter deck and is easy to read. I love the being able to keep a journal.
5,An Exciting Introduction to Tarot,"This is the book that made an avid Tarot reader of me! Gracefully written and accessible, it will inspire you to read rich meanings into the imagery of the cards. I find myself returning to it again and again.-Donna Gillespie"
5,An excellent set of both cards and easy-to-understand book.,"The book contains clear and concise meanings for each of the 78 cards of the tarot pack, and fascinating information on tarot rituals, numerology, and especially how astrology combines with tarot. Bravo!"
2,cards very poor print quality,"Cards not worth buying, some were missing name, some missing numbers. So you don't always get what you pay for in quality. I would not recommend this kit due to card content at all"
3,Good chairs-packing an issue,"Total (in different orders), we purchased 3 sets of these chairs - 2 side chair sets and 1 armchair set. The finish is a redder than it appears in the photos, but we like them. How they're packed was a problem. Of the 3 sets of chairs, 2 arrived damaged. There was no damage to the exterior of the boxes, but in both cases, the back piece (that your back rests against) was broken. And this piece was packaged in the center of each box. One of them was completely shattered. No other piece in either box was damaged. Due to our delay in opening one of the boxes, we only received one replacement piece from Visiondecor, with no option to purchase a second replacement piece. Other than purchasing another set, of course."
4,Tank lever that works,"This tank lever seems to be a good quality trip lever. The handle is attractive and the lever arm is made of brass (will not corrode) and has multiple holes for attaching the flapper chain. I would recommend hand tightening this and then applying a dab of silicone adhesive to ensure that the nut does not slacken with use. (By the way the nut on mine was plastic, not metal as stated by another reviewer)"
4,"Works, and isn't that enought?","We had to have our landlord install it, but overall, it works, its not broken, and doesn't do anything weird. Best we could hope for."
3,nicer than the white plastic handle,"We wanted to replace the plain, cheapy looking, plastic handle on our toilet.This was a straight forward install and it fit the tank fairly well. It feels a little loose when using it but still sturdy (a lot of the chrome handles you get in the store are just chrome plated plastic, this one is actual metal!)Three stars because ""it's ok"" and does its job Nothing more and nothing less..."
4,its what it says....a replacemet part!!,"It has little style and excitemebt, true.But it is metal, NOT plastic, thats what matters. it looks OEM and works perfect. To the last reviewer, I understand your problem as I was installing mine, the inclused metal nut does not hold on to the ceramic tank well. My solution was using the old nylon nut, but a-simple rubber washer would work too (between the tank and nut).So, it is what it is....a good replacement CHEAP."
1,One star due to item description and bad CS,"When I searched for ""universal toilet lever"" this product came up along with 3 or so others. It doesn't have a good enough description as to the types of toilets it fits, and it doesn't have enough pictures for someone to make a visual assessment.This lever only fits tanks with the flappers controlled by the chains. It does not fit the plunger style flush valves.What's worse is the company expected me to pay return shipping for the item that they didn't properly describe and didn't provide any good pictures of."
5,This is a wonderful album,"Painful experience has taught me to approach albums by actor/musicians with caution. I was delighted to find that it was unecessary in this case. There's quite a variation of mood and tempo from one track to the next, from the upbeat ""My Sweet Selena"" (I suggest reading the back cover for more on the origin of the title. It's clever and very... well... sweet) to the whistful longing of ""So I Sit By the Sea."" ""Yes You In Blue"" goes on a bit of a tear with a slight flavor of the 60's and ""The Ballad Of William Robinson"" is wonderfully tragic. The songs themselves are well contructed and the tunes are the sort you'll find yourself humming without even thinking about it. I highly recommend this album!"
4,I got mine autographed!,"This is a fine album by the talented actor/singer/songwriter/musician. It may or may not be his first solo album. He supposedly released a solo album in the early '80s, but I have been unable to find any information about it. Of course, he had released many albums as one half of Barnes & Barnes before this. But this album is a lot different than a Barnes & Barnes album. It is not a funny, silly album; it is a serious album. Besides writing all the songs, Bill also plays virtually all the instruments. The songs are good, but the one that will be of the most interest to Bill's fans is ""The Ballad of William Robinson"". It is told from the point of view of the character he played on ""Lost in Space"", as a now middle-aged man. It is easily the best song ever written about ""Lost in Space"". There is also an unlisted bonus track, which is titled ""The Great Domain"". This is one of the best albums ever recorded by an actor."
5,Great!,"This is a wonderful job of a truly talented guy. This is a great way to get some great music! It's pure poetry! I recomended this album and ""In the current"" too. You go really enjoy! Bill is really good singer and writer! He's a poet. There's a song after The ballad of William Robinson, someone know that?"
1,Rip-Off!,"This was said to be a $299 book and I paid $55 for a used copy - on the book cover it is priced $24.95 - the recipes are unusable as most of the meats and ingredients are unavailable in the US. I wrote the store where the book came from and, needless to say, did not hear back from them. I will not order any other books online until I have actually looked at them someplace."
2,Timer that doesn't,"Got this timer and it worked for less than a week , then it started to not move the time down. It is no better than an on off switch."
2,Might want to keep looking,The 1st one i received was used and amazon promptly replaced it(Yay amazon). Colors are dull and not nearly as pretty as picture. This comforter is more of a mustard color than gold. Quality is okay. Not great but okay.
3,wrong item,"I received the wrong comforter set twice, the item was similar but not the same quality and look. Eventually, I was rewarded with a little bonus from amazon.com to make it up to me."
1,Poor Conclusions,"There are many assumptions made, most of them false, though some not evident. Then upon these mostly false assumptions, conclusions and details are drawn upon. Poor accounts of history. While appearing to qualify a few details, the author grossly misunderstands much of the history, and draws conclusions that sometimes don't even follow his misguided assumptions."
4,But I'm not complaining,"It's good to have THE MISSIONARY back on DVD again. Kudos to Image Entertainment, especially for bringing it out in a widescreen edition. That said, I noted two things about it:1) While the movie was originally shot in 2.35:1 widescreen, the DVD is 1.78:1. This is a pity, since this is a visually sumptuous film, with some really nice visuals. That said, the cropping is only noticeable in a few shots.2) The source print was not in great shape, with some noticeable scratches. There's also some loss of contrast in scenes with extreme lights and darks.But, as I said, these are minor points. THE MISSIONARY is great good fun. It's not absurd sketch-type comedy like the Monty Python films, so as long as your expectations are adjusted accordingly, it's a hoot."
3,a little dissapointing for python fans....,"this is not to say that the movie wasn't funny. it was, sort of. nor is this to say that there wasn't a good plot. there was. the problem i had with this movie was that though there was a solid plot there was just not enough character development to make it a solid movie. as a huge python fan who ordered this movie simpley because her favorite python is in it, it was a bit of a dissapointment. those expecting the usual hilarious lunacey will be shocked to find that, like many of Palin's later movies, this is a mild, period peice with many manners about it. no dead parrots here. Not a bad film at all, but io prefer American friends if i am to watch a polite Michael Palin film."
3,Sylvia - Anthology,"If you're the kind of person that doesn't want every song she's recorded, but just want something with all her big hits, this is the album for you. Some boring songs, but since I like very little country music, maybe it'll be a gem for you. Nobody, Snapshot, Cry Just A Little Bit, Never My Love are some of the standout songs."
5,Sylvia's long awaited return ....,"Sylvia has finally made a long awaited return to the music scene. I thoroughly enjoy this cd. I do hope that she will follow suit of other artists and rerlease old vinyl albums on cd versions. Sylvia has a rare and true talent that is not as prevalent in music today. If more people heard her voice they'd be surprised it is country as it is really contemporary. With country mega stars like Faith Hill making the crossover to pop music, there is no reason the multi talented sylvia can't follow suit. This is an excellent compilation of many 80's hits plus some new songs too. I strongly recommend this cd."
5,A Must for Salem Witch Trials Enthusiasts!!!,"Finally, original texts! Those of us interested in the Salem Witch Trials must thank Ms. Hill for providing us with the opportunity, finally, to have access to many invaluable first-hand accounts of this most fascinating moment in history. Reading this extraordinary volume provides not only a political, religious, and historical context for the trials, but fills one with a real sense of the emotional response experienced by both victims and accusers. In modernizing spelling, Ms. Hill has rendered these texts a bit more readily comprehensible, yet she has changed neither the actual text nor its meaning. For students and enthusiasts of this subject alike, this is an absolute necessity!"
1,The Salem Witch Trials Reader,This book is written in the manner of speaking of that era. This makes it difficult to read.
1,Bound By Honor,"The cd was a total waste of money because it did not have the full main themes but two very short skits, The soundtrack did not have any themes of any characters. It was hardly like a soundtrack. The hole tracks are not even thair."
4,Cruzin' Rolas,This cd had some good rolas that reminded me of my cruzin' days way back in the day. If you like old school oldies or cruzin' rolas this cd is for you and only if you liked and understand the movie.
3,bulbs,"bulbs arrived in good time and in perfect order, however i found they did not last too long before burning out ??"
1,"Lucy deserves 10 stars but, these volume sets do not","'I Love Lucy' is one of my favorite shows and I want to someday collect every episode but, the way these episodes are being distributed is just terrible. There are so many other television shows being released as complete seasons. Why can't Lucy be that way too? I am dying to get Lucy on dvd but, I will not buy any episodes until they are released as complete seasons on as few dics as possible."
1,A piece of junk,"Save your money, the flourscent light has never worked. Cannot get the 12 volt battery to charge no matter how long you try to charge it. Cannot find replacement bulbs or batteries. This is a ripoff."
1,Wouldn't remove medication patch adhesive residue,Smith & Nephew removers work; these don't. Period.
4,Not too bad for the price,"Bought this lappie a week ago. DVDs play fine and display is decent. What I did not like is that it has only 1 PS/2 Port which means that either you can connect a mouse or a keyboard but not both simultaneously. Futhermore I noticed that when I connect a mouse the system freezes occasionally for a second completely (the sound as well as display).If you research well you will get this one for *well* below $... with mail in rebates and other discounts.Overall a decent machine for the price.Pros:1. RAM upgradable to 1GB2. DVD/CDRW is really handy on a lappie3. S-Video Out4. Affordable; Good value for money5. Light for its priceCons:1. Only 1 PS/2. Can connect an external keybord or Mouse, but not both2. System freezes occasionally when mouse connected to PS/23. Ctrl key at an awkward location (not the leftmost in the bottom row)4. Gets over heated if not placed on a completely flat surface5. Could not find the specs but I suspect that the FSB rating is not really good."
5,Really happy purchase.,"Running winDVD (U2 elevation tour), plus Live internet television feed at 99Kbit/sec on the side. displays flawlessly so I added yahoo messenger web cam and it's still going strong at 93% cpu usage according to task manager.Yippy! love this thing."
2,Make sure you buy an extented warranty,"The computer is a great deal after rebates-just remember you get what you pay for. Compaq's customer service does not know who their authorized repair centers are (I called their number listed on an email response which was not toll free, but they do have a toll free #)and they want you to mail it in to them for repair.My computer is 2 months old and the USB ports are so loose that I lose my internet connection and abilty to use my A drive. Otherwise it operates well. If you need USB ports that work well, don't buy this machine."
3,Not for little ones,Bought these for my nephews and was not happy to see how small they were. They can easily be put in the mouth and chocked on.
4,careers in computer graphics and animation,This is one of the book referd by my teacher and I find it very useful for my class or for anyone interested in Entertainment Industry. It does have very good information for any careers especial how much people can earn in different fields of Entertainment Business.
2,These are okay...,"These measuring spoons work as they are supposed to, but the writing on the spoons that indicate measurements rubbed off with my thumb shortly after buying them!"
5,Saves on storage,These spoons save on the amount of things I need in my drawer. The small one also fits easily into small bottles to get powder/spices out. Great gadget!
1,Great promise... but disappointed,"I washed and used one of this set once. The black ink measurements on the right-hand side are all smudged and I could wipe them right off. I'm disappointed because I only use it once. My sister has the ones from Pampered Chef, which are more expensive, so I thought these would be better. They do not."
4,A Really Great Mix,"This has been one of my favorite Christmas collections since I bought it. It's got a great mix of religious and secular music, with nothing too pop sounding and nothing overly classical sounding. Very pleasant to have on during the holidays."
4,Comprehensive technical advice for potters!,"This is a must-have reference for anyone who's been frustrated with production problems in the studio. A real time saver! Covers everything from firing defects to glazes. Whether you're dealing with crazing glazes or cracked, warped ware, you will get answers here."
5,Andrew Gold and Graham Gouldman have a winner,"If you like the 80s, Andrew Gold and Graham Gouldman have a winner here. It captures the energy and fun of that decade with ear friendly tunes that make you feel like clubbing! With both being iconic songwriters spanning several decades, the duo create a synergy that is a once in a lifetime thing. This two CD set was a bargain! Defnintely a must for fans of Andrew Gold, Graham Gouldman and the 80s."
5,Attractive werewolf story.,"I recently bought and watched this movie, I got to say that I really liked it. The special effects were impressive when the man was turning into the werewolf, I liked the format of the werewolf and the story was romantic and passionate."
3,Memories,"Sure the movie is outdated compared to what cinema has become today but what early movies aren't. The first time I saw Meridian I was to young to appriciate it but now I do. The photograpy is great. Those with and active imagination will enjoy this movie more than others, and even if Beauty and the Beast type stories aren't your thing there is plenty of other aspects to the film that are sure to interest you."
5,Good,"The nude is very light, so it's dyeable. It's opaque. I bought the size I would get at Victoria's Secert and the cups were perfect. It moved inward with my waist, but still provided control, too."
1,don't buy this if you're tall!!,"I am 5'10"" and this product was sooo short on me. It came up to just under my bust line, no way it would have fit. measure before you buy!"
4,Excellent Supportive Product,This body briefer was exactly what I was looking for because I found my original one in a discount store and I needed one in black. It helps control in the places that need to be controlled. Great purchase and I love it!!!
4,Wedding Wear,I am really pleased with this product. It is very comfortable and works very well under a wedding gown.
3,Sizing Misleading,"I am a 34B in all of my bras so I ordered this item by the sizing available, 34B, which was the smallest size available. When received, the bra portion was way too big and the body of it was too big as well. This was supposed to provide shaping, hold in what needed to be held in and it was just too big. The material was very high quality and it was a nice item at a good price but the sizing info was just misleading. I guess they think that a person size 5/6 doesn't need any type of shapewear."
2,"If you enjoy 'historical fiction' written as a 'Lifetime Original Movie""....","Sorry, have to agree with other 2 star reviewer. The premise is ridiculous, and would not have occurred at this juncture in Scottish history. I could not quite fiugure out why I was not 'getting into ' the book after first several chapters, and then realized, yes, indeed, this was but a romance novel that happened to be placed in a specific period/geography. The interspersed useage of 'Scottish dialect' was maddening, and the characters were thinly drawn~ the feisty heroine, the dashing hero, good guys, bad guys,etc...Did not find the desricptive/narrative passages particularly colorful or well-drawn.If you LIKE romance novels, then , probabaly a pleasant read for you."
2,A rather ridiculous premise,"The main character, a 22 year old woman, is chieftain of her clan and an infamous warrior heroine. Riiiiight. Superficially written and oozing with saccharine. I literally laughed out loud at times -- example: one of the characters has purple eyes to match their kilt. Not a serious read unless perhaps your tastes include romance novels which feature Fabio on the front cover."
1,Outlander like??? No Way!!!!!,"This book is so dry I don't think I can finish it. Very disappointing.Diana Gabaldone has this author beat by a mile. There is absolutely nochemistry between these characters. And the dialogue is so 20th Century.Totally unbelievable. This is strictly grammatical, but a couple of timesI noticed she used the word ""can"" where ""may"" should have been used. Idon't think 18th century Scots were misusing those words the way we do today.Maybe not. Who knows. I do enjoy romanic novels but I can't even get that outof it. I'm wondering if I should even finish it."
3,Just OK,"I read this book because in a couple of reviews it was compared to Diana Gabaldon's Outlander. I love the Outlander series so I guess maybe my expectations were too high. I was definitely disappointed. I felt the book read choppy at times and found how quickly Duncan fell in love with Rory unbelievable. Overall, this book was OK. There was more I didn't like about it than I did like. I would not recommend it."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered these based on good reviews from other sites. I have two heavy bedwetters, and I hoped this would make for easier cleanup and less laundry. I have had the mattress protectors for about a month. First, they are difficult to wash and dry because of the 'waterproof' barrier. Second, they are certainly not waterproof - only water resistant. I couldn't figure out why my boy's bedroom was still stinky after I removed all the wet bedding and clothes. Then when I remove the mattress pad this morning, I realized that the vinyl protector I kept on the mattress, just in case, was wet. So much for waterproof. Now I'll have to find something else. I suppose these mattress protectors would be alright for somebody who was not a heavy bedwetter."
4,Interesting!,"The movie is in black and white, which adds to the authenticity. Johnny Depp plays the role well. All star cast."
2,I don't see it...,"I must have missed something...but why make a movie about a failed director? I like Depp and Bill Murray but their roles here are bizarre, and in Murrays case they don't really let his comedic talents shine. He could have added some needed humor to the story, instead they accentuate his bizarreness without mining Murray's comedic talents.All in all a very disappointing film that I could not watch to the very end, and even after reading all these glowing reviews the only way I see this movie again is if I'm in a film class and they dissect it for teaching purposes - not for entertainment."
5,HOW DO YOU BUY IT?,I WOULD LIKE TO BUY ED WOOD BUT I CAN'T FIND WHERE IT SAY'S BUY THEIS ITEM. WHY MAKE IT SO COMPLICTED TO BUY SOMETHING.I'M GETTING FRUSTRATED JUST TRY TO FIND OUT HOW TO BUY THE MOVIE.
5,This isn't right to delay this again!!!!,"Can't believe this studio is stopping the release on DVD AGAIN! What is the problem now? There is no excuse for this and it really is unfair. With all the junk that they put out on DVD, they can't release Ed Wood? Come on Buena Vista, get with it and make this happen...SOON!Johnny, help!"
5,Now that was amazing!,I just got done watching this movie...10 min later i ordered the Ed Wood Collection. Yeah he was the worst director ever but this story was amazing. One of my fav. T.B movies. Probably under Beetlejuice. Imma watch this movie again tonight with my girlfriend and im looking forward to it!!!
5,DO YOU DARE ENTER THE WORLD OF EDWARD D. WOOD JR.,"Absolutly the best film ever made! A love letter to filmmakering without any of the spite and cynicism that Hollywood seems to thrive on. Inspiration awaits for anyone who dares to enter this twisted and charming bio-flick about the worst-director of all time, Edward D. Wood Jr."
4,"Great move, horrible marketing...","The rumor going around as to why this title has been delayed is so Touchstone Pictures could capitalize on possible wins at this year's Oscars by two of the film's actors: Johnny Depp and Bill Murray. Therefore, the studio can market the film as featuring ""Oscar Winners Johnny Depp and Bill Murray!"" Pretty weak reason to p*ss off legions of film buffs. Nevertheless, Ed Wood still stands as Tim Burton's greatest film. Perhaps, it's worth the wait..."
5,A fascinating story of a filmmaker&#65533;s life.,"This movie is very good. The idea that it's in black and white may seem annoying to some people but I think it makes the movie feel more ""real"" (like `Schindler's List'). This movie doesn't make fun of Edward D. Wood. Jr. or portrays him as an idiot or an incompetent filmmaker, but as a man who really wanted to make movies, and believed they could be successful. The actors are great, Martin Landau got an Academy Award for playing the old, sick Bela Lugosi. The movie feels very real and it is a fascinating story. I suggest you buy it, especially if you're interested in Wood and his movies."
2,i could have lived without it,I love Johnny Depp. But I should have known a movie about the world's worst movie maker couldn't be anything but equally as bad.
2,I don't get it!!,I don't get what is so great about this movie. I LOVE Johnny Depp and I had to force myself to finish this movie. It was boring. So I don't understand why people love this movie so much!! The acting wasn't bad it just a bad boring script. It took me three days to watch it. I would watch it for a while and then stop.
2,"Mediocre comedy,Not Burton's Best nor Worst","This mediocre look on Edward D. Wood,Jr. is sometimes funny and other times tedious.Johnny Depp"" role as Edward is funny and Oscar Award winner Martin Landau's role as Bela Lugosi really shines.This is not a documentary but a satirical look.Edward D. Wod directs some of the WORST movies in film history but how he directs he movies he does his best.and the movie just shows Edward's relationship with his friends.The casting wasn't too good and the black and white cinematography didn't looked like it belonged because the movie should have been shot in color.Just watch this one on TV or rent but do not buy it."
4,Great Movie!,"I love this movie. Johnny Depp is awesome! Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi is Incredible! I believe he may have won an Oscar for his role. There are many celebrities in this film and they all do a great job. The movie is sometimes a little sad but mostly very, very, funny. It's also an interesting story about the life of filmmaker Ed Wood Jr."
5,Overlooked,"i have loved this film for years and i feel that it's overlooked. many tim burton fans have not seen this movie, which is a shame because it's brilliant. johnny depp, as always, gives a memorable performance as edward wood, the famously awful movie director. the movie is both comic yet sad at times. i recommend it to any burton fan."
5,One of the best films ever made about one of the worst film,"makers ever. This film left me stunned and enchanted. Depp is really powerful as Ed Wood. Wood comes off as one of the most childlike humans on a serious mission without the skill or means, but enough gumption and belief in his mission to make some really bad films, so bad that they're classics. This is a kind of behind the scenes drama of a group of people who don't really have the big name, big money to be taken seriously or be given credit to make a film. But the people are all too real and gain much empathy with the average movie goer. It's like an outsider's view for the outsider."
5,What? NO DVD??,"What are they waiting for? This is probably one of the best films Tim Burton has directed, and one of the best roles ever played by both Johnny Depp (as Ed Wood) and Martin Landau (as Bela Lugosi). I don't want to keep buying VHS tapes that deteriorate on me over time. My last copy just konked out on me. Get this on DVD, PLEASE!!"
4,A future release for you...in the future,"Wow, I only now (3/7/4) read that the Ed Wood DVD was recalled. Fortunately, my copy had already been shipped to me :-)I did not notice any technical problems playing the movie or special features. Some rumors have it that music rights were not secure, others that the studio was hoping for some Oscar fall out.Regardless, this is the best of Tim Burton's movies that I've seen (about 4 others). I think his work is generally too gloomy and dark, but this was a great movie. It has off-beat characters, a good story, and best of all, a recreation of portions of ""Plan Nine From Outer Space"", Ed's infamous really-bad movie.Well acted, funny, and interesting characters from start to finish. Nice extras on DVD."
5,"""You're the ruler of the galaxy! Show a little taste!""","At last, the whole (shocking!) story of Edward D. Wood, Jr. I enjoyed everything, from the acting down to the musical score (fans of ""Dracula"" will notice that movie's opening theme plays in several scenes). Johnny Depp is a hoot as Ed Wood, and Martin Landau absolutely shines as Bela Lugosi---he certainly deserved the Ocsar he won for the role.The film is by turns hilarious and sad. There are loads of great one-liners (""Yes, but if you take that ... and put a star in it, then you've got something!"") and other endearingly funny moments. Landau's portrayal of Lugosi provides most of the pathos, showing us the tragic decline of a man who tried his best to work until the very end.""Filmmaking is not about the little details. It's all about the big picture!"" Tim Burton has done a wonderul job with both in this movie."
5,"""Let's shoot thees fokkerrrr!""","Anyone who doesn't like Johnny Depp hasn't seen this little masterpiece. He turns it into a unique comedy, and his chemistry with Burton is nowhere more evident.This movie is funny as hell, time after time, and the scene in the swamp is legendarily hilarious. Landau turns in a bravura turn as Lugosi, and his zeal after getting his swamp fix is somehow one of the funniest things I've ever seen.I don't see why this didn't hit bigger; way too smart, probably. In any case, here it is, ready to be a bigger cult classic as the decades go by."
2,Needs to be more durable,"These stamps looked great on the website, unfortunately when my first graders put any type of force on the stamps when pushing into the stamp pad, the red stamp holders are hollow and they crack. My students have used them for 3 weeks, 4 to 6 letters of each set is cracked. Home use is probably ok, but not for classroom use."
2,THIS AUTHOR HAS ZERO CREDIBILITY,"WHY SHOULD WE TAKE ANYTHING THIS AUTHOR SAYS SERIOUSLY. HE'S LAST AND ONLY OTHER BOOK WAS A NATIONAL ENQUIRER STYLE TELL OR -- OR RATHER TELL NOTHING -- ABOUT A FRIEND WHO TRUSTED HIS CONFIDENCE -- JFK JR. BRADLEY CANT EVEN USE HIS REAL NAME -- RICHARD BLOW. HE'S A PHONY AND HE DECIDED TO TRY TO ADD SOME PANACHE TO HIS ALLEGED ROLE AS A WRITER BY DOING A ""SERIOUS BOOK ABOUT AN INSTITUTION."" I READ THE BOOK...IT'S ALL SPECULATION BASED ON ZERO RESEARCH. IT'S ESSENTIALLY A CUT AND PASTE JOB. FORGET IT. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME."
5,fireline,I replaced the original hose for my hydration system with this thermal control kit before heading for the fire lines in Calif. Through out the heat of the days and the exerciase of digging fireline my water remained cool and refreshing. The first mouthful was a bit on the warm side but nothing like with the original hose which was unprotected. With the cover I was no longer eating dirt and ash from the fires but a cool clean mouth piece. Thanks for a great improvement to and already great product.
4,"Hands down best Mason Bee Book, the only one really",A tiny book for a tiny animal. There really isn't much out there written on these amazing bees. This has all you need to know and more. It could only be improved by adding color photographs and current ideas on housing issues.
3,Helpful but outdated,"Although the content of this book is good, it is very out of date. Much has changed in the aviation business in the past 6 years. For example, it didn't talk about finding jobs on the internet, only that you could sign up on bulletin boards. And the sample salaries are very outdated. It did however, show me the various ways to go about getting my advanced pilot ratings and the time frame it would take to acquire them. This information is relatively still the same. This book would be helpful for someone who has no flight experience and is just at the beginning stages of becoming a pilot. But it is not helpful for someone who is already a private pilot and wants to make it a career."
4,not for a beginner,"CATIA is a very specialised and powerful CAD package. As the text discusses, it is capable of scaling up to handling large projects. Where, for example, you might design much of a plane entirely within it.For professional engineers, this book is a good up to date reference for the latest major release, 5. Comprehensive descriptions that show the full capabilities of the package.One caveat is that if you have never used CATIA before, this book might be a little overwhelming. But hopefully, you have at least used some other CAD package like AutoCAD or Ideas, so that you are familiar with the basic ideas."
5,Stephen Duffy is a Pop genius,"I've been a big fan of Duffy since his ""Tin Tin"" days when the single ""Kiss Me"" was released. Following him with The Lilac Time has been very enjoyable. If you have never heard Duffy before then get this disc!! Duffy's sound really has not changed all that much from his early days in the eighties, he just uses less synths now. The disc starts off perfectly, like someone searching on the radio dial, only Duffy songs are on all the channels. It the goes to ""Eucharist"" which is a great song. It has a bit of an edge to it, which is a little different for him. The song ""You are"" is my favorite. There is some good guitar work on this CD as well which gives it a strong power pop feel which was a pleasant suprise. This cd is a perfect cross over from the Lilac Time and has just enough of a twist to have a distinct Duffy solo sound to it. This is definately a keeper and one I will listen to for years to come."
5,Mr. Duffy Does It Again...and again...,"Is there no end to this man's talent and creativity? Fortunately for us, it seems as if there isn't. Having been a fan of Stephen's folk-pop mastery in The Lilac Time since the late 80's, I must tell you that this (and all of his) edgier guitar pop sounds just as natural, as organic, and as beautiful as any of his TLT work. No songs will be skipped on this CD, I assure you....if you are a fan of XTC, Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe, Matthew Sweet, etc. you must own this album. Like the aforementioned artists, Stephen's work takes a perfectly modern stance while firmly shaking hands with the more ""vintage"" sounds of previous eras. If you need it in Beatlespeak, think Rubber Soul/Revolver. Just get it, and anything else of his you can get your hands on. OK?"
5,Great Stove,"This is the best stove for the money. It is heavier than most two burner stoves because of the cast iron burners. It will put out a lot of heat. The temp contols let you dial it up or down. One word of warning, don't buy the case that Amazon recommends for this stove. It is not the right one and you will just have to send it back. Get the Camp Chef model # CB-SSUNV. It is the right case for this stove.Campware Sport Utility Stove Bag"
5,Workhorse,Got this for camping trips. Heavy duty and does a much better job than the smaller camp stove burners. Need a large propane tank but it comes with a hose. The legs are not a convenient height. I put it on a picnic table.
1,Private Benjamin plus Troop Beverly Hills minus Stripes = 1,"Private Benjamin (3) plus Troop Beverly Hills (2) Minus Stripes (4) leaves this with a one. Or you could say I gave it a one because it was in color. Dead, no action, seen it all before kind of movie."
5,Just Watched and I LOVED It!,"Jessica Simpson is becoming quite the actress! In her new movie, I found her to be very charming and she had good comedic timing. It's a nice feel-good movie that is making a nice addition to my DVD library. I suggest everyone watch it!"
4,Surprisingly Funny,"Jessica Simpson seems to get lambasted in the press almost daily, so I didn't have the highest expectations for this when I saw it. I was pleasantly surprised.The movie was a feel-good popcorn movie with some really nice moments. I especially enjoyed Viveca A. Fox as Jessica's drill sargeant and Ryan Sypek as Jessica's love interest, and there were some great comic performances by Cheri Oteri from SNL, Michael Hitchcock from the Christopher Guest films. and Olesya Rulin from the ""High School Musical"" franchise. Jessica Simpson at times is a little flat (no pun intended) but for most of the film her likeability and charm shine through, and she can be quite funny in her signature ditsy-blonde way.On the down side, it's obvious that the filmmakers were purposefully trying to rip off the comedy classic ""Private Benjamin"" (including the name of the movie) starring Goldie Hawn. But when it isn't try to copy ""Private Benjamin,"" it is a pleasant, and at times, very funny, little film."
3,Jessica Simpson does Private Benjamin,"After ""Blonde Ambition"", my expectations for this movie were very low. As I started watching it it seemed better than I expected. It was pretty funny at times and Jessica Simpson worked surprisingly well in the lead role. She's helped by some good supporting actors, especially Vivica A Fox and Cheri Oteri. The plot is extremely predictable and taken directly from films likePrivate BenjaminandFeds. About halfway into the movie, the film started taking itself a bit too seriously and became less funny. Still it's a decent way to spend 90 minutes. Weak 3 star rating. Would have been a solid 3 stars if the second half had been as good as the first half."
3,This is not the San Francisco band - LUCE -,"this is NOT the new cd ""Never ending"" by the San Francisco band LUCE >>> Do not be confused by this cd by the band The Secret, titled ""luce""... i was. and The Secret are a bit on the Hardcore Metal side. so if you came looking for the cd with that ""good day"" song you heard in ""13 going on 30"" or ""Alias"". or the CD, with the song about ""buying a dog"", that would be the band LUCE - ""never ending"" ASIN: B00081U67S"
5,Genuine Sony Battery NP-FM55H works great,"I am using Sony NP-FM55H Battery with my sony A100k Camera. I don't have any issue at all. I don't know whey for some users it got stuck inside the camera. The battery is perfectly fit for the Camera. The one who wrote that it stuck in the camera, Are they sure they bought Genuine NP-FM55H Sony Battery only. How can same battery stuck on some cameras but not all. I am surprised. For me I don't have any issue at all. The battery is not even tight at all. perfect fit for the camera."
5,Performs better than advertised.,I have had this battery since I bought the camera. I have charged it maybe 3 or 4 times. When we left on vacation for 2 weeks abroad I tried to get another as a back up but could not find one. So without any charger I pushed it to the limit. The result is 941 pictures on the highest jpeg setting. I generally turned the camera on and off as needed. A few times I forgot and it turned itself off. However I did not use the flash.
4,great battery,"I purchased this battery as a backup for my main battery for my sony, i when almost a whole week without switching batteries."
2,Buyer beware,"Battery was shipped from Ace Digital Club. This battery is struck in my camera and can not be removed without the camera having to go back for repair. It appears that this Sony Branded battery is different in length from the original supplied with the Sony A100.Camera is currently at a Sony repair center(now 5 weeks) to have this battery removed.So now not only am I without a camera, I wasted approx $45 on a Sony branded battery that is now useless.Sony apparently seem to be aware of the battery size issue but has not nothing to recall these batteries before others have the same issue as me."
1,Questionable quality,"Although this battery clearly was packaged as ""Sony"", it got stuck in my new Sony Alpha A-100 and did not fit well in my Sony charger for the same camera.Looking at the back of the battery, commas were used instead of decimal points.For these reasons, I believe that the batter that I received was what is called ""gray market"". It was not made for US market, and probably not even made by or for Sony.However, I did receive a refund from the seller."
3,Useful accessory,"Essential accessory for the Alpha to give you peace of mind when photographing away that you won't run out of juice. High capacity means you get lots of shots (including use of flash) out of each charge. However, it's not one of Sony's regular 'Infolithium' batteries which means the camera won't tell you the remaining life of the battery in minutes, only a approximate indication of battery life using a 4-segment display."
2,battery replacement,Had only partial success with this type of replacement and spare batteries. Have had trouble in recharging them so that they would last very long.
1,don't buy this battery for a sony a100 camera,The battery is absolute crap. If you insert this battery into a sony a100 that came with the exact same part number/shape/size/amp battery and the camera indicates this replacement battery is an unsupported battery.
1,Sound Blaster Audigy 2 ZS,"This audio card was bought for only one purpose - to record ""What U Hear"" for a Vista PC. It doesn't work in that capacity and no properly working software appears to be forthcoming from Creative Labs. The card has proven worthless to me."
1,Crap,"Don't waste your money, I've had it over a week, the only thing I hear is static coming from the notebook speakers, have yet to hear anything from external speakers, spent hours trying to resolve the problems. It's going back!"
3,works for the most part,"not the greatest, it works until you try to safely remove it from windows. then it blue screens. also installs a bunch of stuff at startup."
1,Not as pictured,"I ordered this because I liked the contrasting stripes in the pillow shams and bed ruffles, however, what i got was everything in the same pattern. There are no stripes to be found.The quality is also second rate, the gold color is not as bright as pictured, it is a dull brown.It is going back."
2,BEWARE: not at all as shown in picture,The set has no stripes and the gold looks faded like its been washed one to many times. It dosent look at much like the picture shows. Not bad if you dont mind the dull gold look but not as bright and pretty as the picture makes it out to be.
1,Baby Boot Camp,Okay if you're comfortable with taking advice from someone who's never had children. Much too rigid for my tastes. The Baby Whisperer offers more practical advice. For sleep problems I recommend the No-Cry Sleep Solution.
4,Very Helpful!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this book. I read numerous books on feeding and sleeping and this was the only book I found helpful. Gina gives you a wonderful pattern to follow. I do not follow her schedules to a T, however, they are the backbone to our daily routine. I am nursing exclusively and her schedules seem to work for baby and mom. I had only been wanting to nurse for 6 months, however, since reading her book and implementing some of her recommendations I now think I can make it one year (my baby is 3 months right now). Thanks Gina!!!"
4,Thank You,"As first time parents, people started giving us horror stories. You will be walking up and down the halls cradeling, waking up in the middle of the night to a crying baby, etc etc. Thaat is not the case for us.People complain this is not for breast fed babies. Our bundle of joy is breast fed and the regiment is rigid, but flexible, If you understand the underlying premise that the child needs a percentage of milk each day then you baby will grow accordingly.Our little bundle of 8 months is as happy as can be. She sleeps through the night and wakes up at 7am with a big old smile when we pick her up. Takes her day naps, basically on demand.You really need to understand the reasoning for the regiment and can easily adjust accordingly to changes in schedule."
1,"HARMFUL, DO NOT BUY",This is SUCH a bad book. Don't even bother to buy it if you love your baby.I regret ever taking any advice from it and believe it has harmed my breastfeeding relationship with my son.The schedules are NOT SUITABLE FOR BREASTFED BABIES.Save yourself and your child the unrealistic expectations set by this book and go with your instinct.I stress again DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK
1,Unbelieavably bad,"Can't believe any person in the world can follow such a minute by minute regiment. Babies are not machines that can be turned on or off. Babies cries, wakes up at night, laughs and plays! Live with it!"
1,Harsh and insensitive,"Written by a British nurse with no children, this book shows no respect for babies or parents. It reads like it was written by one of the rejected nannies from Mary Poppins. The author treats parents as naive and ignorant with no individual needs or opinions. She treats babies as manipulative tyrants and has no regard for them as human beings. Extremely rigid schedules that baby can adhere to or cry. No flexibility for personal choice. Anti-breastfeeding --regardless of what science proves is best for baby, she appears to think it's inconvenient and unnecessary. If you believe that your baby is a human being who deserves respect and love then go check out another book, such as The No-Cry Sleep Solution or Dr Sears Baby Book or books by Dr. Leach."
1,Teaching granny to suck eggs??,"Sorry, but I can only see this book being useful if you have an exceptionally demanding baby. I don't know any of my friends or family who have used this book and yet their children sleep through the night and feed regularly during the day. My baby is 6 months old and has slept through the night (8pm to 8am) since we introduced solids at 4 months. Prior to that he would sleep from 8pm to 5am, have a feed at 5am then go back to sleep for 4 hours. He has regular naps throughout the day, but he has done this all by himself. Gina's book seems to imply that a baby is incapable of naturally structuring their day. Since man was on earth, we have rose with the sun and settled with the sun. I don't believe stoneage man followed Ms Ford... Don't waste your money. Babies feed when they are hungry and learn to sleep through the night by themselves. Parental neurosis and living by books and manuals is no replacement for instinct."
1,This book will ruin your life,Do not buy this book. It is a fantasy that you can make a newborn baby adhere to a strict schedule. You can't program your baby to behave so that it fits into your schedule - forget it. This author is a danger to all new mothers who are having a challenge settling into their new life - she falsely claims they are controllable creatures that will adapt easily to a pattern - it is rubbish and you will only make yourself miserable by trying to live by these ridiculous rules.
2,I hope this is better than her other books....,"I read two of Gina Ford's books, and just based on what I read there, I wouldn't trust this book for anything.If you choose to read this, PLEASE do so with common sense and the knowledge that YOU know your baby better than anyone.I can't say for sure what this book says...but her previous books speak of ""controlled crying"", claim that there's no way you can breastfeed successfully unless you pump and feed from a bottle, and speak more of failure than of success (in other words, do it her way or you're doomed to failure).Every baby is different. Some babies need more of a schedule than others, some need flexibility and patience. All babies need love, not rigid schedules and unreasonable demands. Please, use common sense if you choose to read this."
1,Love it or hate it,We found this book far too rigid. One would have no life! And the book does not provide enough guidance on how to deal with babies who don't want to salute and follow the schedule.
3,Too regimented to be realistic for many babies,"While the routines are helpful in giving parents guidelines on scheduling their babies, Ford insists on too rigid of a schedule. Babies are human beings - not robots. My baby, for instance, loves to sleep a LOT during the day. Ford suggests to try harder to ""stimulate"" sleepy babies during the day, but offers no specfics on how to do it.Parents should understand that their babies may not follow these routines to the letter, no matter what Ford insists upon in her book. Use the routines as a general guideline, but don't despair if your baby doesn't turn out to be a Swiss clock."
1,Truly Sad...,"I am the happy mother of a happy, sleeping-through-the-night from 8 pm to 7:30 am 15 month old. He slept in his parent's bed (until he was 1 year old), breastfed on demand (he weaned himself at 13 months) and was tended to when he cried (his only form of telling us he needed us). I followed my instincts as a mother, not acted like a machine.I treat my dog better than this woman treats babies. This book sets parenting back to the dark ages."
1,Does this woman have a child of her own?,"Following the advice in this book left me, my husband and my daughter unhappy, frustrated and exhausted. It assumes that all babies are the same and should be treated as such. This author has little compassion, and leaves no room to compromise for babies who don't fit the cookie cutter mold that she endorses. Her method is cold and unfeeling, and tries to mold a baby by ignoring distress, rather trying to first understand the cause of the distress and how to minimise it. I don't agree that she is creating contented babies, rather programmed ones. I would recommend staying away from this book if you are having sleep or feeding difficulties with your infant."
1,More bad advice. Who writes this stuff?,"I don't really know who Gina Ford is or what her qualifications really are, but her advice is pretty scary and I would avoid this book if I were you. I stopped reading after the first couple of chapters since it was clear that her advice was misguided."
1,Unrealistic,"This author makes claims that are not realistic. She has a routine that you need to stick to but doesn't touch on scenarios that differ from her program. As if babies don't cry or fuss during their waking hours; then what do you do? The author keeps reminding the reader that her way is the best because she has worked with hundreds of babies. In other words, doctors, behavioral researchers etc. all have it wrong if their recommendations don't tie in to hers. I think the routines in this book are too rigid and do not reflect real situations. I also don't like her weaning timetables; she will have your baby eating fish and chicken by the time he's six months old.A waste of my money this book was. My three-month old is thriving on a much looser routine, based on many different sources of information that I'm open to. This one I will not use."
3,Good as a general guidline,"I found this book helpful in assessing ""norms"" for my baby. As a general idea of how long a baby should sleep, how much they should eat etc I found it very helpful. I let my baby decide the routine and it was surprisingly similar to the one suggested in the book. However I would not agree with the principal of dictating everything to the baby. My daughter has been a very happy and content baby from the day she was born and she has always set her own schedule. I have just facilitated."
4,My baby slept through the night from 2 1/2 mos on.,"I didn't follow this book word for word. But I did loosely follow her routine and I thought it worked. The truth is, every baby is an individual and there is no one ""recipe"" for a perfect baby. You take advice and mold it into your baby's needs, which is what I did with this book. It worked for me and I highly (and I do) recommend this book."
3,not for every baby,"I'm a firm believer in routine and structure but within your baby's natural lead. There is no way either one of my babies (one, now 4 and still taking 1-2 hour naps) could have functioned or gone without taking naps as this strict routine has you following. Has good pointers but most I've figured out myself now the second time around. This book is not for every parent nor every baby."
5,The Contented Baby Book,"This book has been wonderful! I can not recommend it enough for expectant mothers. The book helps you to prepare for the birth of your baby, and then it helps you to understand what your baby wants. My husband and I have found this book invaluable and our daughter has followed the routines from a very early age. We do adapt the routines as necessary, but we had a guide to start with and were able to understand why our daughter was crying. By eight weeks our daughter was sleeping through the night and continues to do so."
4,Good Info,"This book was one of three that I bought. There is a sample schedule for each age of your baby in the back that is very helpful. I ended up using information from all three books to create a routine for our little one. The other two books were the ""The No Cry Sleep Solution"" (more my style, not so rigid) and Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child which had a lot of great information about the whys of healthy sleep habits which I really liked."
5,Just Fantastic!,"Loved it, Loved it, Loved it. All I can say is that it worked for me and our little girl Casey. She's 9 months and a Gina baby through and through - happy and contented, eating well, healthy and plump. I totally recommend it but you have to be open to trying a routine. Routines rock!!"
4,"A lifesaver, although don't take too literally","I bought this book when my baby was 3 1/2 months old and only sleeping a total of 12 hours a day. I couldn't do anything to get her to sleep more and she was up a lot at night and very crabby during the day. Although the schedule in this book is rigid and she has some odd ideas like giving your baby water, with modifications, it has been a lifesaver for me. Now my baby sleeps 14-15 hours a day like she should and I can get some much needed rest. I do still feel it is best to let your baby try to develop a natural sleeping and eating cycle. However, if that doesn't happen as it didn't with my baby, this book can be a good guide."
3,very regimented,"Its very regimented, every minute is accounted for. I have lots of things to do, so I dont know if I can keep up with the regimen. Its worth a try."
5,Wonderful,I am a first time mum. This book really did a good job. I recommended to every first time parent.
3,A little too militant for me...,"The schedules that the author sets in this book are unrealistic with no room for unexpected events. I would recommend the Baby Whisperer by Tracy Hogg. But on the upside, Gina Ford does have some helpful suggestions in this book that I have used successfully."
3,A book for some but not all,"We tried this book's routine word for word and it worked well for the first 6 weeks of our baby's life but after that it was all downhill. What Gina unfortunately fails to mention is that the most common theory about sleep and babies is that the better and longer they sleep in the day (without being ridiculous like 10 hours in the day!), the better they sleep at night. This is contrary to Gina's theory that the less sleep they get in the day, the longer they will sleep at night.We had to teach our baby how to sleep longer in the day after weeks of an overtired and fussy baby who was following Gina's routines and wasn't sleeping well at night or day. (We used the ""Sleep Right Sleep Tight"" theory to do this!)I am glad to say this worked and she is now sleeping through the night at 15 weeks.Gina's feeding routines and other advice were very useful and accurate, and her sleeping schedule does work for some other babies we know, but not ours."
5,this book helped me,"After just two long weeks of an irritable baby who slept a lot during the day and had wind and gas during the night, all I wanted was sleep. I think Gina Ford helps you get that from your baby. I don't get caught up in all the criticism of her methods probably because I ignore such things as how long to breastfeed on each side etc. For such things, I follow my own instinct. If you want sleep badly enough and you and your baby can fit into her general routine, I would say try it. Sacrifice the first few months when you might want to go out and instead, get a rested baby. I read one comment that Gina Ford's methods would likely bring on post-natal depression as one could not get out. Well, that is rubbish. Nothing brings on depressed feelings like lack of sleep so I would recommend all Mothers to at least try it."
2,If Nurse Ratchett wrote baby books this would be it!,"All i can say is that if you're a type ""A"" person, with only one child, a bevvy of servants and nothing but time on your hands then this is the book for you.In fairness I think if you are a nurse this type of structuring would be very helpful in a maternity ward but for home life..phew!Some of the baby schedules that she would have us all practice are down right hilarious they are so ridiculous. She has to living in some sort of Mary Poppins universe! Not a chance for us less than 'A' types.We have 3 kids and this is the first time we tried this out..and I'm not saying that there no good ideas in there but mostly it's a total fail."
1,Seriously uncool advice,"Yikes. Everything about this rigid ""set a schedule immediately"" theory frightens me. How can a newborn be expected to do anything more than tell you when he/she is hungry? There's a reason all of us new moms are so sleep-deprived: our infants NEED US! Give 'em a chance to grow and thrive for crying out loud. This author owes a lot of babies a huge mea culpa. Someone needs to ask an attorney if the author owes some kind of liability to children who suffer from Failure To Thrive after a well-intentioned Mom follows this bad, bad, bad advice!"
3,GOOD ! by M. Boucher,"An uneven story that deals with the revolution of South America where the lead character, Dax, tries to fight his inner demons while becoming a successfull diplomat, an international playboy, and a leader to his people.A thick book (over 750 pages), the author tries his best to keep the plot going, but sometimes fails at it with his overlong political storyline. Still, THE ADVENTURERS is a good novel with enough of twists and turns that should hold the reader's interest all the way to the end."
1,adventurers harold robbins,"i send as a gift.im waiting on refund ?i dn't hate it i send as agift,but prison's can only accept amazon books only,no other seller's : ("
5,Once Is Not Enough,"finished the kindal version of the adventurers by harold robbins and it is just as good and gripping as it was when i read it in high school in the '60's. mr. robbins books were always popular with the high school set because of the steamy passages but, re-reading them as an adult, mr. robbins' books have stood the test of time and is more enjoyable and clearly understandable. Will be re-reading his books and others on kindal."
2,Not much fun playing with this toy,Played with it enough but even classmates were a little creep out during show and tell. I wish there were as many heads as the cartoon.
5,A for Oprah,"After receiving this wonderful book as a gift, I purchased several copies to give to my close friends for Christmas. We talk about what was on Oprah frequently, and this book has the best of the best. Beautiful photographs, and a balanced array of topics are included!"
1,Too SLOW and repetitive,"It was kind of a bore, to be honest. Not scary, really, never was scared. The cinematography is the main thing it has to offer, story was far too repetitive, even though there was a seed of something interesting there, but it just wasn't enough to make this a good movie."
1,Abandon your money,This is a real waste. Poor writing and used-up shock techniques are married to the mystique of a Russian journey. This is not a genres that I care for. I just rented it because the description on the Tivo interface was lousy and I thought it was a foreign film.
3,Death never runs out of time...,"Abandoned reminded me quite a bit of an Asian film called The Echo (aka, Sigaw) -- and a few others; it's nothing new in the genre, but aside from a severely sagging midsection, the horror and suspense aspects are far from, er, abandoned by first-time director Nacho CerdÃ . This is no doubt a low-budget film with a lot of spoken supposition, running and hiding; however, when the creatures are shown, they don't disappoint. The makeup is well-done, and special effects are wisely kept to a bare minimum.The gloomy, yet sharply rendered imagery from cinematographer Xavi Gimenezs (The Machinist) adds to grim terror experienced by our protagonists, as does the jangling dissonance of the original score by Alfons Conde.While I will admit I was pretty bored during the middle of the movie (I don't mind when things get talky, but nothing new was added to the suspense via the dialogue), it rallies in the end and has a satisfying, fittingly unsettling conclusion.Staci Layne Wilson"
3,Check this one out instead...,"The Abandoned was fairly interesting, but I found the Horrorfest films were largely, well, bad. Some of them are actually pretty fun to watch, but lacked either spirit, or substance, or both. I was lucky enough to attend a private screening of ""Baby Blues"", which will be released on DVD in August and is really quite creepy with some unexpected twists. If you enjoy indie horror films, I'd recommend pre-ordering ""Baby Blues""."
5,finally they released it,i went and saw this one during the horrorfest event. so excited that they released all of the movies to dvd and then had to wait even longer this one because it was rereleased to the theaters for the public to see. finally got it. thanks.
1,Don't get fooled by slick marketing,"Take it from someone who has seen this and one of the other ""Eight Films To Die For""; these are awful, senseless, idiotic movies whose sales are being motivated by a good gimmick. They should retitle these ""8 Films To Fall Asleep On"". Don't be a dolt and get sucked into this series. This is not good horror. Try ""Sublime""."
3,the atmosphere is stifling,"I liked this movie even though it did go slow in several places. But the heavy creepy atmosphere and the wonderful photography of the house and the landscape blew me away!Yes, I would recommend thins film, just on those two things alone!There are the kind of horror films that are so over the top and unbelievable that they don't scare or affect you. this one is different...the creepy atmosphere and the believable reactions of the characters make this one a winner."
3,Girls Night In,Some friends and i rented this movie and after a couple of drinks it was great. In my opinion this is one of those movie where if your alone it sucks but if your with a great crowd of people you'll have a great time watching it
3,The Abandoned,"There was some shock value in this movie but it wasn't enough to classify it as a horror movie. The storyline was slow & tedious. It was too drawn out for my taste. This is not a keeper in my book or my library. Everyone has different tastes. This is just one girls opinion. Truth be told, I was disappointed but I only spent $1.20. There, I said it."
1,Boring read,I tried reading this one but I found it to be incredibly dull. Mr. Brock may need to consider finding an editor to help him with his next endeavor. The text was full of grammatical errors.
5,An entertaining journey through Lessons of the Universe,"As a spritualist, a metaphysic and someone who has dabbled in philosophy I found this book to lend verification to much of what I already personally hold as truth. Steven Brock has laid out these spiritual lessons in an entertaining and heartwarming journey which even a novice seeker of truths can grasp, but don't get me wrong this story through one man's journey is not jsut for the novice or curious, even those of us who have studied for some years and are well along the path well enjoy and take away soemthign from this book. What a wonderful read. Thank You for sharing your journey with us, Mr. Brock."
5,"Fantastic Homage to Mancini, lounge, sci-fi","This is an immensely entertaining soundtrack and a masterful homage to the kings of movie scoring. It also contains a few snippets of dialogue (including Martin Landau's amazingly accurate Lugosi saying ""beware, take care;"" ""pull the strings!"" ""I have no home.""). Movie fans and soundtrack aficionados will thoroughly enjoy this cd. Oh, and here's the complete track listing: 1. Main Title 2. Backlot 3. Mr. Lugosi/Hypno Theme 4. Beware 5. Glen Or Glenda 6. Eddie, Help Me 7. Elmogambo 8. Bride Of The Monster 9. I Have No Home 10. Kuba Mambo 11. Nautch Dance 12. Angora 13. Sanitarium 14. Ed And Kathy 15. Elysium 16. ""Grave Robbers"" Begins 17. Lurk Him 18. Ed Takes Control 19. Eddie Takes A Bow 20. This Is The One 21. Ed Wood [main title] total time: 43:58"
5,"Great work, representing a great man...","Do I mean Johnny Depp? Tim Burton. No! I mean ED!If you enjoyed the film as much as I did, you'll love this soundtrack. It starts with with Jeffery Jones monologue, as Ed's magician friend Criswell. The music reminds you repeatedly of the fine film--one of the funniest on record.Then there's the other monologue. Who can forget, ""Pull the string! Pull the string!""If you have no use for Ed Wood, the film or the guy, this may not appeal to you. But, again, if you love the film like I do, don't miss out on this CD!"
1,Worthless,"This book isn't worth the paper it's written on. There are too many other books worth reading on this subject, look for another option."
5,Collection of Reviews,"The author also wrote the critical account ""Time"" in: The New Book of Knowledge. (Encyclopedia, 21 vols, Danbury, CT: Grolier, 1989.)Does time exist independent of objects or is it merely relations or change of objects? A stimulating discussion, in simple language, for pupils which revises our most common traditional conceptions of time. The reader may now begin to understand not merely how to tell time but philosophical critical theories of time.""Here Shibles does a good job of confronting the reader with some of the unresolved philosophical puzzles about the nature of time."" Louis Katzner Teaching Philosophy""The pupil may now begin to understand not merely how to tell time, but what time is all about. The book presents in simple language, a stimulating discussion of the concept of time. Does time exist independent of objects or is it merely relations or changes of objects? Get the book and find out. I'm sure you won't he disappointed."" B. J. W. Chattanooga Times"
2,Peter Jenning's lack of science.,"I was very disappointed to see the value of the science and fact of evolution degraded by only reproting the story of one man's fanatical and (even though he worked in nuclear science) unscientific war against reason and science.Creation as a biological theory has been tested over and over by scientists and the evidence plainly shows that it does not explain how there are many species of animals. Evolution explains and fits the available fact, has been tested rigoursly by many branches of science, is falsifiable and thus a subject for science (creationism is not), and is now considered a unifying biological principal, accepted as fact by almost all practicing biologists.There is not much usable science in a multi-translated Bronze Age book, the bible, and I would argue very little philosophical value. It requires faith to be believed.Peter Jennings and his co-author have done a disservice to the truth. I am sorely disappointed in this book."
2,OK but not great,I bought this for my wife. The case is tight and invariably keys are activated putting the phone in the case. My wife hates belt clips and Cellet makes cases where the clip is removable. Unfortunately this clip is not removable. This case looks nicer than it functions and it sits alone at home more than it does protecting my wife's phone.
1,A Waste of the Money!,"Purchase two batteries for my Motorola MD681 wireless base station and remote station handsets. One battery is dead. Putting it on the charge, the light came on then went out. Second one work only 2 weeks after that the battery did not hold the charge at all. It is a waste of time and money."
3,Beautiful Story not Examination of Depth,"Beautiful story that touches base here and there around the world and unsurprizingly finds Muslims are people too with problems, and predictable variation in both practice and attitude toward other religions and the west. The film does not probe beneath the surface, clarify the belief system of Islam & whether that system is compatible with other belief systems, nor explore what the cumulative effect the religion of Islam may have on western civilization.Strongly recommend Herb Meyer's ""The Siege of Western Civilization"" and ""Islam: What the West Needs to Know"" for those who desire to fathom the real issues that are past the politically correct aspects of probably most crucial topic of our time."
1,Total waste of money..............,"Don't waste your money, there are far more better documentaries that this one."
2,"Works, but didn't charge to 100% after a month","This battery worked, was shipped fast, was $93 (July'07 now $86 Dec'07) instead of Dell's $130, and was better than the old worn-out one.However, after a month of normal use, it would only charge to about 50-60% of full charge, which meant it would last for an hour and a quarter.This change to ""can't charge fully"" came on suddenly - not a gradual deterioration. In the future, I may go with a real Dell-brand battery, as it seems cheaper on an ""hours of charge per dollar"" basis."
2,not what I expected,Love Kandinsky's paintings and could be due to my own ignorance but this book had limited inspiration for me; I just didn't get it!
2,not impressed,"This book doesn't appear to have been edited well ... there are grammatical errors and label errors, as though there was a rush to the printers. The photos are rather dark. However, on the plus side, the fitness models show good form on almost every page. The workouts actualy appear to be minimal workouts ... the author claims you can do the workout in 30 minutes ... it seems it would be much less at least for the beginner and intermediate stages, given you only do 1-2 sets for only a few exercises per day. I don't believe most would progress very far using these plans, or rather, you'd progress to the advanced stage very quickly or become discouraged from the lack of improvement in your physique. In addition, the book fell apart in less than a week ... the pages fell out ... I'll use them to post on my workout wall. Poor quality production IMO."
5,More like complete ECSTACY!! Duh!!,"Do sweet pop gemsicles grow on the bushes in Sweden? Yes!! And does Labrador collect these tasty said gemsicles, package them, and then unleash them on the proles of the world? Indeed!This is a positive review in favor of everyone owning this product."
3,Barely above a VH1 special,"I expected a lot more than this film gave. It was barely above an episode of ""I Love the 80s"" on VH1. It seems to smug about itself to really want to get dirty in the business. There are a lot of details overlooked or forgotten in what went down around this film. At first I was kinda disappointed that they weren't able to tap into the material that ended up on the Midnight Blue DVD, but judging wtih what these two hucksters did with the footage they received, Al Goldstein was better off putting it out on his own. I was rather offended by all the Dick Cavett moments since he had nothing really to add to the film."
1,This movie was not good at all!!!,The DVD was easy to use but that's about the only good news!!!! It dealt with a subject I wasn't interested in.
2,Not as interesting as I thought,"The documentary was somewhat insightful, but lacked the depth I was hoping for...no pun intended."
3,"Please, it's a documentary","While there are a couple explicit scenes, they are quick and certainly not very titillating. This is a documentary (2005) that explores the legal and moral atmosphere that began to change in the 1970's with regard to the film industry. Having lived through all of this, I found this interesting but not very informative. Linda Lovelace of course is a focus but not ""the"" focus. She flip-flops from a star struck porn actress to a victim in front of Congress then back again as a model for men's magazines. Please. Still, there is no question ""Deep Throat"" changed the culture with regard to porn and its wider acceptance with mainstream audiences."
5,Great flick,I really enjoyed watching this documentary. It was funny as hell and it really accurately portrays our society's views on women and sex.
3,Inside Deep Throat,"Its the story behind the making of Deep Throat the movie. It covers the actors, producers and the mob, who currently own and control the movie and the amount of money they made from it. It includes coverage of government intervention in an attempt to censor the movie and prosecute the actors and producers, leaving the mob alone, on what they think people should not be allowed to see. The movie is on the investigative news style digging up facts and embellishing them to make their point. It was a good movie on those involved and its history."
3,This Movie is deeper than I thought,"THis movie tantalizes you with a little porno action, but this a historical film about the porn industry, civil rights, and the hypocracy of those times. The film is too long and often drags on with extensive interviews of minor players, but over-all it make a fine addition to my eclectic collection of films."
3,Documentary,"Deep Throat was a pioneer X rated film which has remained a classic for lots of reasons. This documentary explores these reasons and includes the darker side to the film, and what troubles plagued the producer (Damiano), the male star (Reems) and of course the main star Linda Lovelace.This is an interesting documentary yet it becomes obvious that it all could have been summed up in about 45 minutes, if not sooner. People will be drawn to it to see more about Linda, and perhaps the inclusion of the 10 second X rated footage (in the unrated version). However, the segments on Linda's life are really short, whereas Damiano gets a lot of mention throughout the film.Still, aside from these criticisms, it is worth at least one viewing. And that's all she wrote."
5,Cute for your flower girl!,I bought this book along with several others and it was a perfect addition to my flower girls' gift basket. They absolutely loved it!
1,Rip Off,I purchased this book for $4.98 thinking I am getting a large coloring book when it is just a standard size book with the purchase price of $2.99 printed on the book. Why was I charged 4.98?
1,nothing i missed in iceland,"i recently visted iceland and heard this movie was worth checking out from some locals. well, i purchased the movie on here, on amazon.. save your money if you are thinking of buying it. it was rushed and predictable."
4,"Quirky, funny, charming","Somehow, even the spaced out layabouts of Iceland are appealing in this film, set in the dark months of Reykjavik's winter. The main character, Hlynur, lives with his mother, provides the hash, does nothing. ""What kind of nothing?"" Hlynur's mother's girlfriend asks,and he replies, ""The nothing kind.""Nothing much happens in the film either, but it's an interesting nothing, with a good soundtrack and curious images of the bleak winter streets and the bohemian cafes and bars of 101 Reykjavik. If you've been there, it's also fun to spot the places you know.Mostly it's subtitles, but quite a bit of the film is in English. The sound quality seemed particularly good to me."
4,Great little-known Icelandic film,"While planning my trip to Iceland this April, I stumbled across a mention of this film and decided to check it out, mostly for the scenery of Reykjavik. However, this ended up being a thoroughly entertaining film. The story line, while somewhat unconventional, made for great comedic highs infused with all the emotion of the complicated relationship between the main characters. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of foreign or independent films."
1,Another bad movie,"Typical boring plot, salsa wannabees. Horrible acting and the unremarkable dance scenes are dragged out. The closeups of Rico and his intense stares are trite. As for the dancing itself, lets just say I've seen more sophiticated and inventive salsa moves in Idaho. When you have to keep fast forwarding to find an interesting moment you know the movie is bad. Evidently the other reviewers don't salsa."
5,i love salsa....,"I love this film, beautiful music and dance.... I want to know if it will be available also in french... i hope so!"
2,Don't insult my intelligence,"I gave this movie 2 stars because I watched it all the way to the end. I did not like this movie and would not recommend it. I like dancing. But I don't see masturbating against a car engine as dancing. The ""dancing"" in this movie is all sexually suggestive/explicit. The director, producers, and choreographers came up with the idea to put hormone crazed teens and 20-somethings in a movie where they gyrate, rub their bodies against another's, then label it dancing. The protagonist was full of ego and machismo. If I'm not mistaken, Rico (the lead character) had sex with an underaged friend of his sister's. Then ""dissed"" her in the next scene. In reality, I think he'd be accused today of statuatory rape. I did not like the message this movie was sending to young people."
2,Too Much Emoting,"A predictable story line, plenty of overacting, and teen angst limited this film. Too bad, because some of the dancing seems quite good. Even for its time, though, this must have been a ""C"" movie."
3,Corny!,"This movie embodies the corniness of the 80s. Everything about it is so dated. You'll find yourself laughing at the corny dialogue and ""romantic"" scenes. The plot is weak, there not as much dancing as one might expect, and the acting was mediocre;hence, they're not in any more movies. Robby was cute, but looks only get you so far. If you want to watch something out of boredom, or are looking for some mindless entertainment (it's an OK laugh because it's just so silly), then this is the movie for you."
3,Fun for Mambo & Salsa Freaks!,"This is a cute love story surrounded by good dance scenes. I purchased this movie because it was the movie that brought out the Salsa/Mambo itch that had been stirring in me for way too long. The music and dancing is hot and it carries well throughout the movie. Many dance movies focus too much on the actors or some hokey plot and the dance scenes are too brief to appreciate. However, while the sub plot of this movie isn't AAW, it is fun and cute. This movie's main plot is about the dance~ and in the dance scenes is where it excels. I recommend this movie if you want to here some good music and, primarily, watch some good salsa dancing."
4,Cheesy but GREAT,"After i watched this movie for the first time, i watched it everyday for 2 months straight. Even now, soon to be in my 30's i watch Salsa and still get excited at the dancing in the movie. The storyline was great as well."
4,great movie,Great movie. I really enjoyed the drama and the entertainment. I highly recommend this movie to any lovers out there
4,Salsa,The movie is great. Its exactly what I was looking for. Its great that I was able to find this classic on dvd. I loved it.
4,Viva la salsa!,"The dancing in this movie is energetic and sexy! The people in this movie are energetic and sexy! But...you won't find a great plot here or even a great love story. If you're looking for awesome salsa music and dancing, you won't be disappointed."
5,Salsa: HOT HOT HOT!!!,"This movie is for people who love drama, sex appeal, and dancing. Salsa gave me the urge to want more. Everything from the vindictive women to the fights to the dance moves reminded me of reality. I am Puertorican, and this move seemed very close to home, but I wouldnt recomend this movie to anyone looking to acquire anything other than a couple hours of fun."
1,A minus B movie.,This movie really didn't show me anything exciting in Salsa dance...the only exciting thing was seeing singers performers Willie Colon and Celia Cruz.
1,Not worth 2 hours of my time,"What a mistake buying this DVD. As much as I love all things Latin American the story of ""Salsa"" has not stood the test of time unfortunately. It should remain in the 80's to never be seen again. Harsh but I hated it"
3,Almost Perfect,No scratches but it skips in the begining and towards the end. But I got through the movie. Almost perfect.
1,never received the movie,"The movie itself is wonderful. I ordered it because it was a chiildhood favorite but as I write this review I have yet to receive my movie. So this is a review on the seller,they get a big 0. Amazon.com as a whole you guys are great."
4,Lyrical and Lovely...,"The score to THE JOY LUCK CLUB is one of those exquisite gems that you always search for but rarely find. The sweeping music on this CD is definitely enough to bring you to the verge of tears; it speaks volumes on love, commitment, and pain. Definitely one of the best scores of the 1990s, and for relative unknown Rachel Portman, a true hallmark in what promises to be a rich career. If you're hungry for a good, dramatic score--and one with Chinese overtures--then this is the disc for you. Buy it!"
1,To Bad,"I ordered 4 of these and three of them came broken....however the product is nice. Know though that you can get a lot of pictures in if you store them loose, if you want to put them in photo sleeves or little boxes they do fit, but you can only get two into each section limiting your storage space."
3,Photo Case,My reason for only an okay review was the fact that I felt misled by the photo. The photo shows individual photo holders in the case. These photo holders are not part of the case. This case can hold the photo holders. My fault for not reading clearly but still I feel misled. I decided to keep the case as I have so many photos which just need filing and this case has divider sections and labels. The bottom has a section which can hold my large photos which is very helpful.
5,Works as expected,This was a fine setup until my wife outgrew the small form factor with her coupons. :)We eneded up purchasing an 8.5x11 binder with a zipper at Walmart which works even better. We then purchased larger sheet protectors for the new binder.
3,Good...but,"I saw this little box of throws in at a retail bookseller, and would have bought it then, but one of the ""pages"" was missing. So, I came home and ordered it from Amazon. I'm satisfied, but wouldn't ya know, the only project I've done from it, I had to figure out the pattern for myself. So, beware. The publisher does have corrections to other publications on their website, but not for this particular publication. I sent an email to them with comments about the error, but did not get anything back from the publisher. I'm not an experienced knitter, but was able to figure out the error and complete one of the throws so that it actually looked like the photo. That's why I gave it an average rating.....and I'm not sure if any of the other patterns have errors. Guess I'll find out along the way!"
2,Awesome design- Poor quality.,"Handsome bag with some great convenient features such as the built in tool & patch kit, the integral rear light attachment, nighttime reflective strip and quick release fixer. The fixer however is the problem. It broke with almost no load on it 4 separate times. I had to keep replacing the fixer. It got to the point where I needed to keep a spare on me to repair on the road along with a philips head screw driver to remove the broken one and attach the new one. The guy at my bike shop told me they are constantly replacing fixers for this bag and recommends only using it in the warmest summer months when the plastic is not so brittle.The zipper pull also broke off on its own, but I can still open and close the bag with my fingernail. If Topeak ever addresses the fixer problem or offers it with a Velcro strap option I would definitely recommend this bag."
1,Good in Theory!!!,"I purchased this bike bag a few months ago along with a few friends. We quickly noticed issues with the zipper in the tool part of the bag. When riding moderately technical trails we noticed that each of our bags half way through the ride started dumping tools. So everytime we stopped you'd have to zip the bag up as the zipper would start to creep open. At this point, we've all lost about half our tools and the bag is now a running joke between us all. I would not buy this bag unless you are doing road or very lite trail riding. I engaged Topeak since we all had this problem and figured it was a known issue and got the response of ""Thats a bit strange. I have never heard this issue before."" with no action taken so far. So on top of the issue with the bag, questionable customer service by the manufacturer."
4,"Nice pack, may not fit your seat","This is a good pack and a good set of tools. The only problem I ran into was that the bracket would not fit my seat. When I contacted the company they had 'No solution'. I ended up using two wire ties, which in conjunction with the velcro seat post strap works OK."
4,"Topeak Survival Tool- Great pack, not a guaranteed fit","This pack is great and seems to have everything you would need in a bind. However, in trying to install it on my bike, I found that my seat position does not allow me enough room for the pack to click into. The back of the clip attaches underneath the seat and the bag slides into the clip. Unfortunately, there is not enough distance of travel to get into the clip before hitting the seat post. Just something to keep in mind!"
1,Didn't work out for me,After about a year the bag kept falling off the mount and down onto the back wheel. Not useful for mountain biking! I'm now going to have to buy a different pack and throw this one away.
2,Poor design,"Very disappointed in the design of this bag. Seeing that it's a ""universal"" bag, it should be made to fit any saddle. I have tried it on 4 different saddles and the clip on the bag is too far forward. My boyfriend even went so far as to move the clip assembly further back to accomodate the saddle and it still does not work. Guess I'll keep the tools and trash the bag."
4,Good variety of gadgets,"This pack contains everything you need during a ride and more. As you ride more and more, the size and weight of the pack starts to become an issue. This would be great for someone who is not too concerned about being as light and aerodynamic as possibe on their rides. I've since changed to a smaller saddle bag carrying only the essentials (levers, tube, and hex key/ wrench)"
5,Nice Job Niagara Cycle,I order a Topeak Survival Tool Wedge Pack and got a Topeak Survival Tool Wedge Pack on Time! Thanks Niagara Cycle keep up the good work!
3,'SO SO',"The disk is only 27 minutes long. It seems to have been prepared by someone using a home burning software package. The sound and video quality are good. But it should sell for $7.95. It is overpriced. It is an inexpensive tv show put on a dvd for resale. The actual train journey is a 500km and return trip from Bombay to the western coast. It takes about 4 days. The trains (the journey uses about 3 or 4 trains) are either old deisel or older steam. The stops are at local historic tourist spots. There are about 4 stops. They are o/k, but not worth the cost of the dvd. If you want to see nice trains travel from north India at the Himalayas to south India into the tropical jungles and through the variety of interesting countryside and peoples YOU WILL NOT FIND IT HERE. KEEP LOOKING."
4,Good Soundtrack,"If you love the music you hear in the movie, then you'll like this soundtrack. The reason I rated it 4 stars is because you don't hear the big fanfare music featured in the end scene where Tony Danza's character feels all wiped out."
2,Poor quality,Although the book is entertaining the quality is terrible. The pages can not be turned without them falling out of the book. It is very disappointing.
4,It is what it is,"Having heard ""she comes in colors"" I wondered what other ""gems"" might lurk on the CD. I found few. I did like ""andmoreagain"" and a few others had a nice beat. I found this to be one more CD where a one hit wonder (she comes in colors) led me to believe that maybe I would find something more on the CD. Would I buy it again knowing what I know now - yes. It was worth buying just for listening even if I didn't find anything else to compare to ""she comes in colors""."
5,THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BOOK,WE BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR OUR SON TO DO HIS RESEARCH EXPO ON. IT WAS SO INTERESTING THAT I READ IT ALSO. IT EXPLAINS THE SITUATION SO CLEAR. THIS IS A STORY I HAD NEVER KNOWN ABOUT UNTIL NOW. IT IS WRITTEN FROM A CHRISTIAN PERSPECTIVE BUT NEVER THROWS THAT IN YOUR FACE. IT IS WRITTEN VERY WELL. I ENCOURAGE ALL HISTORY BUFFS TO BUY AND READ THIS BOOK.
3,Out Of The Depths,"A fair first person account of the sinking of the Indianapolis. However, in the reviews I read prior to buying this book, I failed to catch the drift that this is not just the story of his experience, but a book of religious preaching. I don't mind that he attributes his survival to an act of god, but I, for one, am not a believer in the supernatural and would rather have read a true-life account without all the religious rhetoric. The story itself is very fast paced, without a lot of the neccessary details, and appears to have been written by a first-time writer.This is pretty much the only book I've read on the Indianapolis that gave a start to finish personal account and for that I am greatful. I did, however, have to read around the sermons.If you are new to the subject of the Indianapolis and it's sinking, I would suggest you start with IN HARM'S WAY by Doug Stanton. It is, overall, the best and most objective account of the sinking that you will find in print."
5,A must for any serious carrier aviation fan.,Excellent reference for those that want to know more about naval aviation than view a few cool photos!
5,Worked well,I wanted to get my husband's shoes off the floor of his closet and this did it nicely. Only one man's shoe fits on each opening so it doesn't hold as much as I had hoped but it is sturdy enough for heavy shoes and does the job fine.
5,Very nice knife set!,"These knives arrived at my home today and they are wonderful! I had been using a really cheap set of knives before these arrived and WOW I can tell a world of difference. I agree with the previous review, I would not wash these in the dishwasher, even though it says they are dishwasher safe. And also as another reviewer stated if you are a home cook this is more knife then you will ever need. I'm very happy with my choice!"
4,Kitchen Knife Set,I've only owned the set for a short time but have really enjoyed how much better the knives work than my previous set. Because there are six steak knives we find that these knives get used a lot more than the other knives in the set. Even though they feel lighter than the other knives in the set they work very well. I would recomment this product to anyone looking for a reasonably prices 16-piece knife set.
2,Rust issues,"I bought this set a couple of months ago the knives developed rust spots almost immediately. When I exchanged them, the second set had the same problem: RUST! The steak knives are very cheaply made and will dent easily, but more importantly, if you leave any of the knives in the sink overnight, by the next morning you'll find rust spots all over them. This is truly an inferior product."
1,DONT DROP!!!,"I've had my set for three years now. If left in water more than five minutes they discolor. They say they're German knives but on the metal it says Made in China. Tonight one of the long blade knives fell out of my dish draining rack to the floor and when it hit the floor, the blade broke. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone under any circumstances. Especially not since they weren't cheap to buy but are obviously cheap made."
2,base in not good,"The base for this is made out of ugly material (not wood but some composite something),and the one we received hada bent piece that looked like it would break. We sent it back."
1,Worst Knives,"Don't buy these knives! They are the worst knives we have ever owned. First off, it says they won't rust. They lie. Even if you wash them and put them in a dish dryer with the tips down to dry, they rust. The rust is almost impossible to get off too. Also within a few uses they are beyond dull. Even using a sharpener they don't seem to be sharp again. Save your money and buy ceremic knives or go to Walmart and buy something cheaper, they will probably work better!"
4,Very Sharp,"I bought this set of knifes for my wife 4 months ago. We love using them, the best and worst part about them is they are so sharp. It is very easy to slice through pretty much anything. You just have to be careful, if you barely touch skin you will be putting on a band aid. Other reviews talked about how the steak knifes were junk. They are by no means junk they just aren't solid forged like the rest of the knifes, but steak knifes aren't for everyday use they are steak knifes. So unless you are strickly carnivores they will be very good and last a long time."
1,Two different style knives in the set. READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY!!!,This is not a complete forged synergy knife set. 6 steak knives are from cheap fine edge style and rest of them are forged synergy. Description does not give this info. Steak knife handles are plastic. I am returning this set and asking for refund.
5,Excellent!,Great product. Much easier to use and maintain than other much more expensive Henckels knives. Holds a wonderful edge without constantly turning to the steel.
2,Last third of these in the box were defective,"I ordered this box of 100 sheet protectors in February 2010 at a price about 30 percent off the retail value.The first two thirds of these were perfect.I have discovered (a year after I received them) that the last third of these (about 30 or so) are defective along the left seam, such that you cannot fit a regular sheet of paper inside them without creasing/wrinkling the page.So I guess you get what you pay for --when the product is significantly discounted. I paid about two-thirds of the retail price, and got about two-thirds of a box of fully-usable sheet protectors.I can still use these remaining defective-seam sheet protectors for items that are not 8.5 by 11 inches in size.If you are ordering a box of 100 of these sheet protectors because you need 100 of them for a special project, be wary that not all of them may fit regular sheets or paper."
1,Box arrived open (used) & sheets full of dust particles,Looks like my box of sheet protectors didn't get the protection they needed. Box arrived open (used). I didn't bother to count to see if they were all there and dust particles in most of the sheets. I think there are some salvageable ones at the bottom.QA?? Definitely not a new unopened product as promised. I am not big on paying reshipping fees on clearly messed up product. Choose a different supplier.
4,these worked great for what I needed,I bought these sheets to keep my take out menus organized within a 3 ring binder and they are perfect for the job.
4,Can you build a life on sacrifice or is it compromise?,"`Tourist Attraction' by Connie Bennett is more of life story than pure Harlequin Superromance. This is the story of Lauren and Ross both successful business jet set people who fall in love. Their fast pass life comes to abrupt halt and it tests their love. If you enjoy Elin Hilderbrand, you will enjoy this novel."
4,Review of Queen at the BBC,"Item arrived earlier than expected. Perfect condition. However, bad packing. The box arrived almost opened. One could have easily taken the CD out of the box."
4,Queen at the Beeb,"Not being a big Queen fan this album was suprising for it's production quality and the fact that Queen had it's signature sound cemented well before they were signed by a label. These are early recordings and I like the heavy sound. ""Son & Daughter"" is the reason I bought the disc. When I first heard it, my immediate thought was Black Sabbath's ""Warning"" from their debut album. If you are a fan of heavy metal, this CD will not disappoint and this version of ""Son & Daughter"" makes it well worth the purchase price."
2,Don't pay full price for this one,"This provides fans with alternate takes on the classic album versions, re-recorded for the BBC.A more elaborate guitar solo in ""Son & Daughter"" and Roger singing lead for a verse in ""Doin' Alright"" highlight this mini-album (though you were charged full price at your local record store.)Why all of their BBC sessions haven't been officially released is strange. There are almost 30 tracks in all and has the only known studio recording of ""We Will Rock You"" (Fast Version). One can only hope."
5,The early essence of Queen music caught on CD.,"I am an avid Queen fan and the first time I heard this album, I was blown away! Queen shows us all why they are considered one of the greatest rock bands of all time. From sheer hard rocking power to light and tranquil melodies, they embody what music should be. This album contains 8 songs recorded for BBC radio in 1973, the same year Queen released their self-titled debut. The first 4 songs were recorded even before their record was put out. After hearing them on the radio, I am sure record companies were impressed and the album was released. This shows Freddie Mercury, Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon in their early brilliance. Upon hearing this, who wouldn't think that Queen would become a world power? I give it a 10! END"
5,I loved this book,This is a great book. It is told through the letters that a girl and a boy write to each other over many years. They are from different cultures. It is a touching sweet story that you will love.
4,Fun Slides,Great way to get the kids working up a sweat indoors. My son got a pair and then we had to get another pair for his younger brother so they could skate together. We also bought a sets as birthday gifts for some friends that are really into hockey and they LOVE them. Great unique item.
1,Terrible!!!,Don't bother to buy these. They don't work well at all! Not good for fitness either. Save your money and buy something else.
2,Didn't work for us,"Not sure what the problem was but these didn't really work for us. I anticipated lots of fun, having grown up with hardwood floors and socks, but the sliding potential was not reached. They played with them 1 day and then never again. Our kids are 11, 7, and 5. None were impressed."
5,could not be better,"Never have I had a pair of funslides before but now that I have them I love them.You can skate on the carpet(carpet only,they don't call them""carpet""slides for nothing),grinding on the fun slides rail(sold seperaitley)or my favorite,mini hockey.I'm telling you,you HAVE to get a pair of fun slides.They only hard part is getting the buckle on when you get it."
2,Lame!!,"Many Problems with this toy1. Because of the way your foot is secured on the skates, they often slide over the skate and hit the carpet, interfering with a smooth ride.2. Since the bottom of the skates are just plastic, you can never ""glide"" across the carpet. Their more like carpet shoes instead of carpet skates. You basically just walk across the carpet instead of skate across it.3. The only way they are fun is if you are on an incline... on carpet. Good LuckOverall, Lame! Lame! Lame! Disappointing execution for such a cool premise"
4,Very fun sliding,"I originally bought these for myself as an alternative to the Valslide but when I got them in and my 9 yr old son and niece found them, they tried them out on the carpet and had so much fun and begged me to buy another pair."
4,Sorta works....,"My son received these as a gift and was really excited to get them. However, they don't really slide all that well. I'm not sure whether it is our carpet, but he has to run and try to slide for them to come close to working. Regular walking does not have much sliding effect."
4,fun slides,"i ordered these for an 11 year old. the only thing she was disappointed with was that they were not ""neon green"". she loved them other than that."
5,Lots of fun!,I was totally surprised how much fun these were. My 9 year old daughter loves them. I even use them. Once we get all out boxes put away we'll have more room to use them. It will be quite a work out then!!
4,Carpet skates,"I bought these for my 5 year old, recommended age was 6 I think. They were pretty large for his feet but he liked them and they did slide across our carpet well. (We have really fluffy carpet) of course my other children took a turn and my 9 year old seemed to have the easiest time with them. Fun for the price, we all laughed at the kids slipping all over the place in them."
2,I didnt like it much,I have all types of skates so wanted to try this one to add to my collection. Seems pretty cool but it doesnt skid much on my carpet.. It works with lot of speed but not much fun..disappointed.
3,"FP Learning Train, Amazing Animals Hippo","Bought this Hippo recently to add to my sons animal train animals. Says that it squeaks, but sounds more like a wheeze when it is shakin'. Mouth doesn't open very wide. Legs click and that is about the extent of it's abilities. I wouldnt say this was a stellar toy, just ok."
3,Just Okay,"I think this is the least engaging of all the Amazing Animals. The legs move like all of them do and the mouth opens a little bit, but the legs don't move as well as with other animals in the line. Also the description on Amazon says it takes the cell batteries, but there is no where to put them. It makes a wheezing sound when you shake it, but it doesn't make a giggling sound at all."
4,A Great Book In A Great Series,The novel is a great book to read. The novel flows perfectly; there is never a point when the story becomes boring. This is the best teen series that follows life though the eye's of teenage guys. The characters are all unique and accurate represntations of teens today. I would recomend this book to anyone!
5,Nostalgic,"I first saw this book at a client's office. When I saw the picture of the movie theatre on the cover, I knew I had to have the book. I was born in Brooklyn and only lived there until grade school but I remembered many of the sites pictured in the book including one that was of my aunt's home!"
2,Rarely running,"2 1/2This artist just can't seem to release solid discs. Despite having an obvious knack for organic electronica, the functionary techno-soul often comes across as simply that- functionary."
1,Disappointed,"Battery wouldn't hold charge, neither would it's replacement, so I guess I wasted money on an an old laptop. Laptop still works fine though on AC"
5,"A lucid, insightful account of biology gone bad","Having read several books on the history and casues of cancer, I can honestly say that this was the most entertaining and insightfull. With the skill of a master technician, Weinberg carefully constructs step by step the processes that cause a normal human cell to turn rogue. He effortlessly weaves such topics as the viralological, carcinogenic and genetic causes of cancer to give the reader a clear and concise overview of the reasons for cancers existence. Along the way he also debunks several common myths about cancer (IE. that enviromental pollutnats are responsible for a large portion of human cancers). While its is not necessary to have a degree in biology to read this book, a general understanding of physiology and genetics (basic) certainly makes it more enjoyable. My only regret with this book was that it was a mere 170 pages long."
5,Must read,"This is an amzaing manuscript. By leading the reader through the key discoveries in modern molecular oncology , Weinberg is able to elucidate the hallmarks of carginogenesis in simple, yet comprehensive ways.This is a must read for any doctoral student. However, Weinberg simple and entertaining language will be enjoyed by anybody who has an interest in the pathways that lead to cancer."
5,Post-baby must have!,"I was not lucky enough to be given this while at the hospital after the birth of my son. I ended up needing stitches and they itched like crazy! I was talking to some other moms and one recommended this, I was so glad she did! This takes the itch away like nothing else did. Because it's a spray, if the area is sensitive, you won't add further aggravation!"
2,Not much help,"Bought this in preparation for delivery number two, I didn't notice much if any relief with it. I was super hopeful based on other reviews but if I were to have a third kid (not happening) I wouldn't bother to buy this for that purpose."
4,Natural High still gets me High,"Natural High, this was a popular song when I was a young adolescent. I sing in a group and in searching for a song to introduce, I recalled this song which I still remembered after about 40 years. None the less, the sound and feelings the song generates are no different. Unfortunately only a couple other songs on the CD were worth working with or listening too. I found them very dated and out of sync with the song ""Natural High""."
3,More $$ for blank pages??? Buy the cheaper edition!!!,"When I first went to Amazon.com to order this book I found this edition and the regular edition. I saw that there was about a $5 difference between them, so I investigated to see what the difference was. The one thing that stood out to me was the number of pages in each book. The normal edition has 143 pages, but this edition has 160+ pages. Well, I thought maybe there was more content that was updated since the publishing of the regular edition. Guess what...NO! Upon receiving my new book I found that the extra pages were simply blank white sheets (for taking notes?). What a rip-off!!! Do yourself a favor and order the cheaper regular edition."
2,Boo hiss this book is a miss,"I had to buy this book for my classroom management class and in my humble opinion it would pay not to have to read this one. So far, the chapters consist of 70% statistical talk which has absolutely nothing to do with classroom management, 10% is related transitional talk, and 20% is making the point of the research. In other words, this book doesn't just tell you what works, but it relates in gory detail exactly how many studies were used, how many subjects were in each study, the percentiles, the corollaries, yadda yadda yadda. I've learned to skim this one for useful material; I can get through a chapter in about ten minutes. The upshot? Research shows that common sense works best in the classroom. Who'd have thought?"
1,Torn up Book,"The book arrived in 3 pieces, the cover was detached from the book, and needed extensive taping to keep together. The quality of the book was so poor that it should have not been sold to anyone!"
3,At times no practicality,"The book certainly has its merits, but the book is too theoretical in its progression to display classroom management that 'works'. Some practicality would have greatly enhanced the book (i.e., examples found in real life classrooms)."
5,Because you asked,"It was a book , used, came in a very timely manner and is good reading for a teacher. I don't really understand reviewing this kind of product, but it was all good."
5,495 Stopwatch,"This is a very good stopwatch watch for measuring cycle times. We've used them for a number of years throughout our manufacturing plant. We have purchased about 30 of them and have been very satisfied with the functionality. I know there are cheaper stopwatches, but I would definitely recommend this model."
2,"Flimsy, for a small child","I wouldn't recommend this for any child over the aged of 5. Each bundle has only a few streamers in it and it's really pink, not purple. I am very disappointed in this product."
1,Roll in cactus instead. It's free.,"This is indeed DIY. All the nicks and cuts and worse that you'll get from this buzzer will make you altogether unpresentable, even in the dark. Keep going to Mr. Sid, or, if current finances fail, adopt a different style, hairier."
1,just becasue,"I just gave it one star because I know that when you look for reviews people look at the bad reviews, so I wanted to catch your attention..This is a PERFECT phone!I can not believe the nonsense people write here, I was afraid that when I will buy it I will not have the ability to search people, or to pick up the phone with out hitting the speaker phone.Up until know I still don't understand what the HELL they where talking bout?The speaker phone button is INSIDE the phone, there is no way of pushing it, plus you can not put any button on the side unless you are total clumsy.When you want to search people you can search them in two ways, like in nokia or search engine, I really don't understand the people who write here, maybe they talk about the older v3 model."
2,I think it is fake,"I received the phone with its charger as it should be. The thing is hat it was not a motorola one but a different one without a brand. In addition to this, I thing that something is wrong with the battery as I need to charge it twice a day even without using the phone. I still have a razr from 2008 that still works perfectly which makes me wonder what is wrong with this one."
1,PIECE OF USELESS JUNK made in england,"I just cannot understand why a very fine firm like MOTOROLA would put a piece of trash like this on the market.The back cover won't lock. The instructions are a skimpy joke. Hard to place battery,worse for the phone card.Flimsy rough and disturbing to the touch.BAHH ... hope they give me my money back !NEVER BUT A MOTOROLA AGAIN!"
1,Very Disapointed,"very low quality product.i bought same model few years ago and was much better quality, this one is very poorly made.the battery cover won't stay in place. i also got the wrong color!"
3,Worked for a good year,Motorola RAZR V3i worked good when new. Music that was installed did not play continously. To play music I had to play one by one manually. Charge to battery did not last very long and had to be charged daily as battery life was short. Ring tones were loud and audible. The one I purchased worked for a good year. Wished it could last longer.
2,Disappointed,I bought this phone for my wife. I had owned one when they first came out. I am disappointed that this phone does not work the same as the one I had. Also it looks cheap like it may be a knock off. My wife doesn't like it because it doesn't have the itune player like my old one did and reception is lousy.
2,20 text message capacity? Seriously?,"I love RazrS. I owed a v3t which was amazing. I cannot find one like it. I thought that by buying this v3i with expandable memory, I'd be able to store m 80+ txts. But apparently the text mssg are saved on the sim card, not the memory card. Also, this unlocked version will NOT allow you to receive or SEND picture messages.Stay away from this phone."
2,This is an expensive throw away!!,"I have now bought three V3i RAZR's in 6 months time and will never buy another one. I let my dad try out my first one and he gave it back damaged. I thought he just handled it rough because the paint rubbed off of the mouth piece area and the screen has a small crack in it. I found out that this phone is just waaaay too flimsy for every day use. My second one was crushed by my daughter and my third one already has a cracked front screen. I have no idea how the third one got cracked, but I tried to protect it with a leather case. I liked the features and function of the phone, but ended up spending close to $600 and still don't have a presentable phone. I recently bought a Samsung Blast because I have had much better luck with Samung (I still have Samsung flip I bought 4 years ago and it still works great, just no bluetooth). If you want a phone sturdy enough for everyday use, look for another phone."
2,What a disappointment.,"Giovanni, everything you said about this phone is true. The setting up of the Contacts is the most idiotic set up I have ever seen. There is a way to search for contact with out having to go through all of them individually, but it is so complicated and the manual is of no help and I already forgot how I managed to set it up. The phone's menu's differ greatly from the manuals description of what they are. Needless to say , I was happier with my old Nextel that was 3 years old too."
3,shocked!!!!,"well, i'm in the military and was on a mission in the Phillippines.i heard the hype on Cnet 2006 and went out to get a V3i phone.as u will find out from readings,it says that the countries that have iTunes in it are Phillipines included.well, let me say...thats horse crap.mine doesnt come with Itunes and it says it clearly on the side of the box @ the bottom side""V3i generic Non-iTunes Hgm."" meaning there isnt a iTunes in it but the other MP3 player software instead.you can also read elsewhere on the net about the ones that have iTunes...the message button is replaced with a iTunes icon instead.so, that verified my V3i.just be careful before u buy anywhere and ask to see the side of the box where it describes what kinda phone model it is.i'm trying to go back to the store before i leave this country and see if they can exchange it for the real deal""iTunes"". further report later."
1,Voice recognition system sucks,"If you choose English as your language, then the system does NOT allow you to customize voice settings for each name on your phonebook. The built in voice recognition system attempts pathetically to mismatch with any available name. In the previous RAZR, we COULD go to individual phone numbers assign a voice to that number.Motorola has really smart hardware engineers and but some really dumb ones who believe that all world's english speakers have certain type of enunciation, modulation and speed."
3,no messages and no caller ID,"I am using the cellphone in Argentina, and I cannot send or recieve messages or see the number of an incoming call. It may be because I'm using it here. The rest works perfectly."
2,Be clear that there is no iTunes player and several features will not work in U.S.,I thought I would be getting a phone that was essentially the same as the one for sale in the Cingular store. When I got this one I found that there was no iTunes player and in fact I could not find any Music player at all. The speed dial buttons continued to say they were empty when pushed despite the fact that the entries in the address book clearly listed the speed dials as assigned. Some of the network features did not work - I suspect someone with ability to hack the phone may get this to work. Charger that came was Large and bulky European version with and adaptor. Otherwise the phone was fine and funtional as far as I could tell. Just be sure you understand that all the features may not be the same as a US version.
2,Mac and Bluetooth,"The reviews are generally correct. However, this phone will not pair with a Mac. ""Some"" (I cannot find which) V3is do not work via Bluetooth with Macs according to web postings. I was able to sync via USB easily, and iTunes also worked flawlessly. I depend on Bluetooth syncing, however, so was very disappointed."
5,A Master Piece,"I just got my V3i at a bargain price as it is now an ""old"" model. I just use it solely as a phone (not intend to use the music player, dc, WAP, etc.) and find it to be a master piece. It is also a collectable. The battery life is excellent too as opposed to other comments.Get one fast while it is still available on the market."
4,Search phone book,"Excellent phone overall with one limitation unless I am doing something wrong:When you start search, you can type in the first letter of the name you want to get to and it'll take you to the names in your phone book that start with that letter, but no second letter search to narrow the look up.eg. If I am looking for Moly, I will get all the M's and will have to scroll down from MA... all the way to MO...Is that a good thing or am I wrong ?"
1,dont buy,"i wish i never would have bought thise phone.it only holds charge 1 day,it freezes up sometimes for 30 sec even when u have an incoming call so u cant answer it."
2,"Good phone, bad charging issues","Razr V3i is a good phone with easy to use features. The included pair of headphones work great with music and micro-SD slot gives additional storage. I am using a 2 gb micro-SD card and it works great. However, there are issues with the battery charging. When tried to charge directly with included charger, the battery never reached fully charged status even after 24 hrs of continuous charging. I have replaced the battery but the problem remains the same. I took out the battery from phone and tried charging with a desktop charger and this time it worked. Now I am using two batteries - one in phone and one on desktop charging cradle. Big pain, but this is only way to make use of money I have spent on this phone."
2,save your money! Horrible after some time!,"I never had a phone give so much trouble as this phone. I brought this phone in October 2006 and it worked well initally, but now (less than one year after) it acts crazy and you press one button the volume goes up and sometimes blanks out totally!Also the battery doe snot hold a charge for any lenght of time. I regret buying this phone. Back to nokia for me.Please note, I am not alone, I have 2 friends experiencing the same problems."
1,Beautiful but...,"Ok. This phone is a big disappointment. The menus are horribly difficult to use and not user-friendly at all, even after a while. They simply are not logically organized. It may be nice and thin, which are the two main reasons for purchasing it but i find it confusing. Nokia has the best menus. i thought Ericson was bad but this really tops even them."
5,AWESOME!!!,This is by far the best phone I ever owned. The features on this phone are great. The phone looks awesome too (better than the V3).Pros:iTunes music playerpretty loud speaker1.3MP cameragreat receptiongreat screenCons:can only download AAC format songstakes a long time (sometimes) to download musicOther then that this phone is awesome and I recommend it to anyone!
4,"Hey, I've got a Mac...","And I can sync my phone just fine. Over USB anyway. iSync recognizes the phone and syncs it perfectly.I love this phone with a very few exceptions.1. It didn't have AIM installed by default, I still don't have it because you need to use a PC proram to modify the phone to enable AIM and I use a Mac.2. There are no BT profiles on the unit I purchased.3. Since the phone hasn't been released in the US yet, Motorola won't give US owners support on the phone.Other than that I'm happy with it. I'd suggest that you buy one from a place where you can try out the phone first to make sure nothing you want is missing before you get it."
2,Motorola RAZR V3i,I am not very satisfied from this purchase.It did not have the features that were indicated in the description.Fred
2,oops...have to set it so show caller ID each time,"maybe there's a work around if you mess with the programming of the phone... what a drag, why would they do this. I regret this purchase I may yet return it."
2,The final (disappointing) end to the series,This book wraps up the series with the author attempting to close up all the tag ends of his character. I for one was not happy with the way he closed it
2,Jane's Train Recognition Guide,"This book was too much overview and too little detail. Distinguishing features were not addressed, i.e. how do you tell the difference between a GP38 and a GP40?It was like a bird recognition guide that showed a nice full-color picture of every finch in the world but showed no ditinguishing marks like beaks and wing shapes.Very disappointing."
4,Train guide,"This is a good spotter's guide for contenporary world railroads. I wanted more pictures,to see all sides and liveries. Judging by the lack of information on american locos, I can only think the other railroads are just as sparse. Still, it is a good reference. I have seen references with more information but not as handy."
4,LG Phone Holster with Belt Clip for the VX6100,Seller was very helpful. First order arrived damaged and they replaced it right away. The second one didn't fit the phone. I'm sure they would have sent another if I had asked but all it needed was a little tape to fill the void and it worked fine.
1,It does not fit the VX6100,"Simply as that....I returned it because althought it states that it fits the VX6100, it does not."
4,"Great, but worried","Great Tripod, just concerned of it's life span. I have used it for about three straight weeks and some things are starting to get loose. It's an awesome tripod though!"
4,Tear jerking movie and a good sound track!,I am surprise that no one commented on this wonderful soundtrack which is a perfect compliment to this wonderful and powerful movie.
5,"short, but very sweet","This has been my favorite CD ever since I've owned it. My only gripe is that it is way too short. I am in search of other wonderful works by Zbigniew Preisner. The ""When a Man Loves a Woman"" soundtrack is relaxing and powerful.Enjoy."
1,REM,"REM sings ""Everybody Hurts"". It's a great song and it's a shame that it's not on this album, since it's part of a defining moment in the movie."
1,Great Movie - Lousy Soundtrack,"The movie was soooo good, the soundtrack soooo bad, even though there was good music in the movie that fit so well.By the way, the song in the credits was indeed by Rickie Lee Jones but the title was ""Running From Mercy"" and not Stewart's Coat as previously posted by someone else.If you liked that version of Running From Mercy, check out Rickie's other CDs. She is an outstanding singer/songwriter."
2,Song Over Credits,"For anyone who wondered what the song playing over the end credits was...it's Ricky Lee Jones singing ""Stewart's Coat."" It definitely should have been included on the soundtrack."
4,Not a great CD - But not THAT bad!,"This is not a great CD, but it is better than most reviewers seem to rate it. If you saw the movie - and liked it as I did, you will notice several pieces in the movie missing from the CD. Why? I don't know...BUT - Percy Sledge brings memories with When A Man Loves A Woman - again and again. And Brian Kennedy's Crazy Love never wears old.The rest of the album, although mostly just instrumental variations on a simple theme - is still good!Although not a great CD, it is one that you can put on in the background, hit the repeat button, and not feel rushed to change.Give it a try - I think you will enjoy it..."
3,what are the missing songs?,i was just wondering if anyone knew what all the songs from the movie are that are not included on the soundtrack. does anyone know their titles and artists?
1,When A Man Loves A Woman: Music From The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,"THis CD needed ""Everybody Hurts"". This is a great song! I am disappointed."
2,When A Man Loves A Woman,"What are the other songs not on the Soundtrack? Especially,something like, ""Everyone gets lonely sometime...."" Anyoneknow title and artist?......"
2,wimpy,"I got one of these for my mastiff. At 125 lbs a regular sized tennis ball is too small for him. This ball is 4"" and a good size for him. However, he had it less than 12 hours before the cover was coming off and the inner rubber was split open. It might be O.K. if you only use it for the dog to chase but not as a chew toy. Overall for something that calls itself ""Tuff Ball"" and says ""industrial strength dog toys"" on the product, I found it to be rather wimpy."
2,Tuff Balls,Didn't last a day with my Mastiff. But not too many toys do!!! Not as tough as the name indicates. I found the Kong products are more durable.
3,not tuff enough,"I really liked this for one afternoon then I broke it with my teeth. After the ball part was broken it was easy to get the cover off and shred the ball into bits. Everyone at the office was impressed at my power!Even though it doesn't squeak, I still tore it up- my people didn't get me another one..."
2,like the size but less tuff than a regular penn,"my dog is tennis ball obessed and likes to pick up 2-3 at the same time.. i thought it would be fun to watch him play with this. he has never pulled the yellow ""fur"" off a regular tennis ball. this one had big patches ripped off in the first day! ill go back to getting free regular tennis balls behind the fence at the tennis court"
2,buy elsewhere,"Folks, do yourself a favor and search for these on the Internet. $7.99 per ball is insane - you can get them at other ""bulk"" places for far less."
5,German Shepherd approved.,"I bought this for my massive German Shepherd who is obsessed with tennis balls but is notorious for ripping them apart very quickly. I have has this product for a month and he has still not been able to rip into it. It also helps that he loves the larger size, and it doesn't roll under the furniture as easy."
5,Wonderful independent film,"Alan Arkin is stunning as a Spanish Harlem father of two pre-teenage boys - this film was made years before the Elian Gonzales event, and I'm sure you can find the plot elsewhere- but this is a warm, insightful and at times biting movie that becomes poignant as well. Rita Moreno is fine in a supporting role, but the film belongs to Arkin, one of the finest underrated American actors."
5,Funny and Original Film,"How far would a Puerto Rican father go to get a news story? Well if it involves putting his two kids on a raft and make the public believe they are Cuban refugees, you know that you are watching an orginal and funny film on what people would do for money and attention. Arkin gives a wonderful performance and although the film is no longer on video, it should be rereleased for many future generations to enjoy."
1,What a waste,"The reviewer who got the defective DVD is definitely the winner here. I had to stop after 30 minutes and find something better to watch.I was willing to forget that 90% of the so-called Puerto Ricans acted Jewish. Really, I was. Give me a good story and I'll overlook bad performances. But all I saw was a bunch of ethnic stereotypes shouting and slapping each other without a single laugh in the thing."
4,Solid book--GREAT PRICE!,"Solid book. Perhaps bit of a stretch for a level 3000 class, but challenging is good, right? (My prof. says that this book is designed for level 3000 or 4000 classes.) Retails for $291 new; EXCELLENT value!"
4,"Piano, Bass, Drums, Vibes and more vibes, bass, drums and piano.","Love the Bass, love most of the songs. Hopefully Amazon will post these songs to listen before you buy."
2,Be careful of what you read..,"It seems life consists of sorting out the truths from the untruths. Trungpa has some good points and I love the title, but this is a dark dark book. If you decide to read it, do so with great care. Also it would be wise to know his story and interpret this book in relation to his life."
4,review,"If... you have a daily meditation practice,... if you believe you are making progress,... if you LIKE the silence and peace you have discovered and you desire more of it, Read this book. It is not what you ""think""."
4,why not,"This soundtrack will really only be of value to you if you've seen the movie. Granted, its a tad corny, but who doesnt love a feel good story about inter city kids finding themselves thru music? I still get a little misty when i hear ""O Happy Day"", ""Joyful, Joyful"" and ""His Eye Is On The Sparrow"". And, of course, who doesnt love Lauryn Hill? Dare I say no one? Sure Whoopie can butcher a perfectly good song at times, but if you listen and reflect upon the movie, it wont really matter. Just listen and be happy."
5,His Eye Is On The Sparrow,"If there is one reason to buy this cd, it would have to be for this song. Lauryn Hill and Tanya Blout did a wonderful job on this song. It is such a gorgeous hymn and they really did a great job. Listening to the words is so refreshing and the song makes me cry just hearing it done by these two ladies. Wonderful cd!!!"
4,Joyful,"I don't know who the Amazon reviewer is (Geoffrey Himes) but he completely missed the point of the soundtrack, which provides some (not all) of the great music in the movie. Ok, so Whoopi not a vocal super-star - she's primarily an actress and a comedian (is anyone shocked by this revelation?) - but she does a very respectable job both in the film and the vocals - she made it fun! The real beauty of this soundtrack is the pieces that were performed by the ""students"" - Oh Happy Day, Joyful Joyful, Eye on the Sparrow, which are lively, lush, and moving. For Mr. Himes to say that ""Several choirs turn in lackluster performances of gospel numbers."", I can only think he must not have watched the movie. If you liked the movie, this soundtrack won't disappoint you!"
4,Great!,The only thing keeping this from being a five star item was the cracked case. I can live with that though.
4,"Great movie, good soundtrack","This film is one of my top 5 movies, and I was hoping that I would LOVE the soundtrack as well. However, there were enough changes that make the soundtrack feel different from the movie. ""If you wanna be somebody"" is no longer acoustic, it is pumped up and sounds completely different. ""Total Confusion"" has a second verse and is not as good as the original.But there are songs that are still great- like the opening number ""Medley"", ""Oh Happy Day"" (some changes in this one too though), ""Joyful Joyful"", and ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough""- and they make it worth the purchase."
5,"It's been what, 10 years now? Still my favorite.","yeah. Ignore Amazon.com's review. This album is not about Whoopi. So many different beautiful voices and boy do I love all of them.. OK, probably except the first medley one, which is, still, fun to sing-along. :)Every song is so full and rich. I love this album so much that I needed to tell something against Amazon's review."
4,"lauryn and gospel, baby","ive never been a religious person, but the spirit and energy and incredible soul contained within this music is breathtaking. i bought this cd for lauryn hill and ryan toby. ""his eye is on the sparrow"",""joyful joyful"", and ""happy day"" are the tracks to buy this for. i dont particularly care for the rest, but this is the only cd i can get those on. celebrating jesus is fine with me. for the first time, i realized what a beautiful thing that could be. ""his eye is on the sparrow"" always puts the hair up on the back of my neck. it's worth it for that feeling. i strongly recommend The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill."
3,WHY CAN'T I JUST GET A SINGLE? I HAVE TO BUY THE WHOLE CD?!,"The CD is pretty good. I mean, if you've seen Sister Act II and you like the music, then you'll love the CD.MY ONLY BEEF IS... I searched literally for HOURS trying to just buy a single from this CD, ""Oh Happy Day."" It is NOT on iTunes or anywhere else on the internet. If someone can find it, please let me know. There is some false advertising out there from other websites who SAY they have it, but when you go to purchase it, they make you buy the whole friggin CD. Grr.But yes, if you're looking for the whole CD, it's fine. Lauryn Hill was in her prime back then. I wish she'd do a gospel CD. Her voice was created for that style!"
2,I won't be purchasing a Gateway product again,"For basic home networking, this router is fine as long as you don't need any support. I could never get VPN to work, and Gateway tech support admitted it was most likely a hardware problem, but refused to even tell me where to find firmware updates since the problem was not discovered until it was barely out of warranty (unless I paid $3/minute or $300/year for the privilege, although they assured me that they still didn't expect to be able to solve the problem even if I paid the steep price). Since this was one of many such experiences over the past few years, I replaced the router with another brand (a less expensive but more configurable model), and have had no problems at all."
4,MGM Midnite Movies is the perfect forum for fun,"Doubling-up the B-movie madness on a flip-disc, the Midnite Movies format gets applause for combining two otherwise slight pictures together for one terrific package(I never would have bought ""Ski Party"" all by itself, so it's a chance for people to see movies they wouldn't normally bother with). Of course, Frankie-and-Annette fans are the main target here and both stars are terrific. ""Muscle Beach Party"" features dozens of musclebound guys in tight hot-pink trunks(lordy, those bathing briefs were BRIEF & TIGHT back then!)and some of the teen-angst between the leads is surprisingly undated and truthful. ""Ski Party"" has the brains of a snowball, but it does feature some good music acts and Annette as a sex-ed teacher, which is worth a viewing all by itself! More, Midnite Movies!"
5,So fun!,"I recently bought this toy with a gift card I got for Christmas. I started playing with it right away. I loved that it had accessories for the horse as well as Lila. I also noticed that Lila's hair matched with her horse's mane/tail, which was very cute! Overall, I loved the toy (and I'm 13!) and I would recomend it to anyone who likes Polly Pocket!"
1,more junk,"Worthless plastic junk designed to make a kid want it, then loose what few pieces that don't just fall apart. Will light up a little ones eyes for a few minutes, then you can pick up the broke junk and toss in trash."
5,All for One and One for Music,"This soundtrack is my favorite! I love the movie and this soundtrack goes hand in hand with it. It has a great blend of romantic, action, and even more action packed music all character to the late 1600's! Well, of course with the exception of ""All for Love"", which is a great pop song that illustrates the theme of the Musketeers and sounds great with the three great voices!"
4,Very Pretty,"This is a very pretty little bracelet. I purchased it as a gift for a friend. It is quite small, but she has small hands so that was not a problem. It is eye catching and attractive when worn. I do emphasize, this is a small thread bracelet, so one's hand size should be kept in mind before purchasing. I do recommend it though, because it is so pretty and so is the little drawstring bag it came in."
5,Beautiful,The bracelet looked great on the computer screen but when I actually recieved it and held it in my hands it was breathtaking. The craftmanship on it was beautiful. Highly recommend this seller for anyone looking for a gift or looking to expand their jewlery collection.
1,It fell apart,"I loved the bracelet, it was beautiful. I wore it for a few weeks when it started to unravel. I am very upset because people really noticed it and liked it. Plus I really liked it. Sot I'm very disappointed."
5,A protrait of Strindberg,"The play is full of humorous sarcasm, and sometimes exaggerations on Strindberg. I didn't understand Strindberg until I read this play, which is better than any other biographies (ok, this is not exactly all about Strindberg, but his character was certainly being presented in this play)."
5,greek for latin learners,"firstly please read the other reviews. this book is not recommended for those who lack latin. if you *do* know latin, preferably 'latin for schools part 1' by the same author then this really is worth buying. after chapter 8 you will need to use a greek grammar since explanations are not given. thanks to the internet, language learning is now going mainstream - join the human race - learn another language other than your own."
2,Ultimately supports belief in magic and monsters,"I LOVED this book....right up until the end, when the grandmother has to resort to ""magic"" to get rid of the ""monsters""---thereby supporting a child's belief in both."
5,Read this if you are in any way involved with children.,"Her approach to raising children is very exciting and insiteful. This book tells of a concept that is at once simple and very profound about the needs of human beings and how we can meet those needs in babies. Ms. Solter has not gotten her concepts out to the media, so there is not a lot of recognition of her work, however, I believe she has gotten to the core of what causes children to shut down to themselves and others and shows us how we can positively effect the psychological and emotional growth of a small child. If her concepts were recongnized by more people I think it could have a profound and positive effect on how we interact with all children."
2,Too much static electricity,This Mason Pearson brush has so much static electricity it renders it impossible to use. I don't know if it's an issue with the nylon or an issue with all their brushes.
4,A solo dad's point of view,The book is easy reading and provides some easy techniques to keep children happy. I found some of the information useful but common knowledge. It's a good beginning for any single father.
4,Must reading!,"For those of us who have despaired of ever seeing a balanced account of Whitewater in the media, this book is fantastic. Buy it, read it, show it to your friends, and keep it handy whenever the NY Times, your local paper or even (yes) NPR start spouting off about Whitewater. This is a case study of how a scandal-hungry media got totally snookered by the GOP propaganda machine and nearly destroyed a presidency in the process"
5,Great Fiction,Superb fiction. Mr Lyons is wonderfully invintive and not bothered by the facts. I am looking forward to his next novel
1,Silliness,"This is a book you buy to validate your pre-conceived notion that a conspiracy haunted Bill Clinton.It attempts to refute the facts by parroting presses releases from Bubba & Hill, and then attacking the people who asked hard questions about where all that money went.What makes this book most laughable if the author's claim that ""the media"" was a participant in this. Isn't he a media of this nefarious media?Save your money, and your time. Leave it on the shelf."
2,One of the most confusing books I have ever read,I bought this book to use for a graduate level advanced mechanics of materials course and did not find it beneficial at all. This is a very math based book with very little explanations. Many of my class mates had the same opinion. Definitely an upper level read.
1,non-delivery of order,i have not recieved this book. i have had surgery and forgot about it. can you please check
4,test kitchen video gift,"i enjoy this program and have told my son, who loves to cook, about it. so this was a gift that i thought he would enjoy as he is also very ""scientific"" and this cooking series goes into testing AND explaining the scientific and specifics of cooking, what cut of meats to use, how proteins react and so forth."
3,Rappin',This was one of my favorite movies as a kid. Even though the performances are not fabulous the film is memorable for it's cast. Even Ice-T has one of his pre-gangsta performances i.e. Breakin' & Breakin'2. This is a must have for 80s hip hop fans. Eric LaSalle of E.R. fame even stars in this film alongside Mario Van Peebles. This film is a reminder of how simple life was in the 80s and how easy it was to make films that appeal to a culture.
2,JUST STICK WITH KRUSH GROOVE ~~~~,"There area few pioneers in the movie - thats cool. I hate to say it, this movie was stupid, even back when it was produced. Just watch Krush Groove, its way more entertaining."
1,Don't torture yourself!,"If you are like me and occasionally look for entertainment to bring you a sense of nostalgia...this is NOT the answer. I find it difficult to believe I even enjoyed this as a kid. Horrible acting, ridiculous story line and embarrassing dancing and rapping. I want my hour and a half back!!!"
4,Great Buy But No ATI 7500,Great Notebook for the money.However dissapointed with the fact that there was no ATI 7500 Video.I think HP Should Compensate customers for that misleading information.Most people bought it for based on that information.I must admit however that the machine runs very well.
2,Disappointing..,"Like many mutual fund investing books, this one was a bit of a disappointment. With the huge selection of funds from which to choose, the authors select just a few of their favorites and don't give ample justification for many of the funds' inclusion. The advice on building a fund portfolio was ho-hum--you can find the same information in any issue of a monthly investment magazine. Also, as with many investment books, the data and commentary quickly feel outdated."
2,Weak Effort,"There were some good points to this book. Yves is a kind, thoughtful hero. I liked the relationship between Yves and Gabrielle. What I didn't like was Gabrielle...Yves claims to be attracted to her intellect. She does so many stupid things, it's hard to think of her as intelligent. And this author is l-a-z-y; she keeps using the same phrases over and over. Both lead characters' hearts ""skipped a beat"" so many times I was concerned they would go into cardiac arrest."
4,Great Read!,"""This is another shining example of the expertise of Ms. Delacroix's writing of medieval romance. I became so involved with the intricate plot and the strong characters, I could not put it down. What a hero and heroine! If you haven't read any of this author's work, this is a good one to start with!"""
3,UG,"The product was satifactory for the money . No more or no less than what I expected However, I might not try the product again nor recommend it ."
5,Most comfortable dress shoes,"I love these shoes, although I have them in the darker color, they were definitely an attention getter.I bought them specifically for New Year's eve party and wore them for about 7 hours that day. No pain what so ever, they felt on my feet as if I just put them on. I would recommend them to all of my girlfriends."
5,Amazing Band,"I've been a fan of their music since 1997 when my sister gave me a mix tape entittled: Music 4 Bording 2. I heard the first song and it just blew me away ( the song was ""Crush us all""). This is my all time favorite punk song. It took me years to find out who sang it, but once I did, I knew I had to buy this sucker. So do yourself a favor and buy this CD if you want the best punk rock music money can buy, or if you're happy with those sissy bands out there that don't offer much, don't buy this album."
5,Seaweed lives on,"Seaweed. How do you describe their sound?? That's just it.... you don't. They had their own powerful and influential sound, and always will. I've yet to hear a band that rocks as hard as these guys, except maybe Quicksand. Spanaway is the definitive Seaweed. Give a listen and you will see why."
1,mediocre metal,"Another band that came out of the Pacific Northwest in the 90's, Tacoma, Washington to be exact. From what I gather, they had some decent stuff on various indie labels, but as so often the case, this major label release was mediocre metal at best."
2,What The ****?,"Maybe I'm just not capable of understanding the new jazz or what the yong guns are up to. After repeated listenings I'm still scratching my head. There is rarely anything to hang your hat on with this poorly recorded album. The worst live recording I've heard since Robert Palmer's ""Live at the Apollo"". The first track sounds like an orchestra tuning up and I'm just waiting for it to take off. No such luck. Just more meandering and noodling. Then there is a track set to a woman's phone call. In theory it's an interesting concept (like a John Cage composition) but in reality it just sounds like an annoying woman talking too loud during a concert.Just skip this frustrating disc if you are looking for melody and rhythm. If you like avant guard jazz then give it a try."
3,Great gingerbread,The book is full of all recipes to do with gingerbread. I thought the book had more gingerbread houses in it and I was not happy because it didnt. Only recipes for different kinds of gingerbread. There are no patterns in this book. So I was a bit dissapointed.
2,Bummer,"I picked up Empty Rooms after hearing ""Head Above"" on a Sound Collector compilation. Amazing track, that, and probably the best thing on here. If the others were close behind we'd still be in luck, but unfortunately much of the rest of Empty Rooms is disappointingly mundane. The songs are well written, well executed, and well recorded, but sadly they're just not very good. Exceptions are ""Mansion on the Mountain,"" ""Blankets and Shields,"" and possibly ""Sleepwalker,"" but three or four enjoyable tracks don't make an album worth keeping (not for me, anyway). I haven't given up on Canyon, just on Empty Rooms. Merely promising."
3,Kids loved it...,The kids liked this one so much they wanted to buy it with their own money. The theme song is catchy - the kids and I keep singing it. William Shatner is fun as Santa's voice. The story line is odd and some of the characters are annoying. But the kids love it and want to watch it over and over.
2,So so Christmas movie,Movie is pretty lame. My 2 year old loves Christmas cartoons but was sick of this one after 10 minutes.
1,"Same old, same old....","Nothing new and inspiring here. It's about Santa Claus and some new villian who tries to stop Santa and Christmas. Ho hum....I got a fourth of the way through and turned it off. Save your money and buy the kiddies a Rankin Bass DVD like ""Rudolph"" or ""The Year Without a Santa Claus""."
1,Horrible Holiday Film,"I am not a picky person when it comes to videos, I actually enjoyed Hudson Hawk to illustrate how low my standards are, however when it comes to this movie, don't buy it. There are numerous song and dance numbers that even the most alcohol laden holiday cocktails can't take the edge off of. If you are looking for a holiday movie to clear out the over stayed guest, pull this movie out and I guarantee they will be gone within five minutes."
4,Thunk you very much.,"The principal writer of this album's music used to be in a L.A. cult band called""What is this"" which also used to contain members of the original Red Hot Chili Peppers(circa 1980ish). That band my musical friends was HOT, this band ""Eleven""evolved much later with his co-writing wife( who sadly died this year).This album is a good mixture of hard driving rock with a dark Goth like twist to it which makes it quite unique in sound and delivery.Unique is good therefore I buy.This album is for those who beg to differ."
5,INCREDIBLE,As good as the contemporary wind band can get. Craig Kirchhoff works his magic again by compiling a collection of new music which the entire instrumental music community can take part. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
5,Swing Dancing is now better then ever!,I love the Brian Setzer Orchestra's new music is great! When I listen to it in the car I always end up singing along with them. This music is great for dancing and it's come back is huge. I hope it will stay around for a long time.
2,"Compared to The Dirty Boogie, this cd does not match up.","If you first bought the Dirty Boogie, and then you decided to buy Brian Setzers other records, this one does not match up to the others. It's not the same style of Big Band music that Guitar Slinger or The Dirty Boogie had. I would not recommend purchasing this cd."
5,this is the BEST Brian Setzer album,THIS IS THE ONE--THIS IS THE ONE-- THIS IS THE ONE--THIS IS THE ONE--THIS IS THE ONE-----DO YOU GET THE PICTURE????????IF YOU LIKE SETZER....(THIS IS THE ONE)
2,Another music lover,"Setzer simply doesn't have the voice to sing big band music. He's great at rock, but can't sing with the horns, he fights them.There is also too much of his guitar. The band is great. Let them show their talent!I bought this cd and later gave it away."
2,stick to rockabily,"I like Brian Setzer, and I like swing music, but unfortunately the intersection doesn't work out terribly well.This recording seems to lack a certain spark, and singing swing music really shows off the limitations of his voice.There's a few good songs, such as ""Sittin' on It All the Time"" and ""September Skies"", but the listener would be better off checking out BSO's ""The Dirty Boogie"", which is really a rockabilly album disguised as a swing album."
1,not worth a hey penny!!!,"Not even worth horse s--t! Brian Setzer is an insult to anyone who respects swing or jazz. He's making fools of you all everytime yo buy his CD's, you could be buying a Louis Armstrong, or Jellyroll Morton CD(REAL JAZZ) instead you're wasting you're money on this jerk's CD, he doesn't even respect swing, in fact he hates it, just listen on his new awful CD, he does a version of Glenn Millers' Pennsylvannia 6-500 so terrible it has Glenn Miller rolling in his grave. Don't support this swing hater named Setzer."
3,A Good Beginning Attempt,"If you are a Stray Cat and solo Brian Setzer fan, you will enjoy this contemporary addition, however be warned, it is not classic Setzer. It tends to be a little more on the ""softer"" side and the Rocker has 'toned down' on this album. If you have ""The Dirty Boogie"", liked it, and are now looking for more BSO cuts, you may be a little disappointed with this one. But Brian Setzer is Brian Setzer, and this is worth having if you are a big fan!"
1,Bootlegged movie recorded off the television.,"Don't waste your money and time with this one. The point of a ""sex comedy"" is for it to be ""sexy"" and have ""comedy,"" both of which have been cut and censored; the movie barely clocks in at approximately 65 minutes. The dvd is a bootleg off a television broadcast."
3,"One good, one bad","""Cry of the Banshee"" is a good, but not great Vincent Price horror film. Perhaps motivated by a sometimes silly script, Price hams it up from time to time. Nevertheless, the overall story is fairly entertaining with nice period sets and costumes. Actors Godfrey James, Carl Rigg and Hilary Dwyer, who starred with Price in ""The Oblong Box,"" return here. Grade: B-""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" is a dull, confusing, slow film. Jason Robards was a fine actor, but he seems out of place and uninterested here. His performance isn't helped by the weak script and story. Grade: C-"
2,Another Fake widescreen,Cry of the Banshee has the top and bottom cut off as well as a bit of the right side from the 1.33:1 full screen version broadast on cable. It is 1.77:1 ratio. Doesn't suffer quite as much as some other releases but still dissapointed.
1,NOT THE ORIGINAL MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE 1971,THERE ARE SCENES MISSING IN THE DVD THAT WERE IN THE THEATRE RELEASE THAT GAVE THE MOVIE A DREAM LIKE FEELING.THE PART WERE ALL THE MEN IN MASK IN THE ROOM HAS BEEN CUT OUT OF THE DVD. THEY NEED TO RELEASE THE COMPLETE MOVIE.I HATEDIRECTORS CUTS.
3,Good titles I'd suppose,"I've never seen either of these films, but I would expect the titles for ""Cry of the Banshee"" to be pretty good since Terry Gilliam is the man who created them.That's all I have to say about that."
4,NY Yankees Beer Bottle Bucket/ Steel Pail,"Great collectible for the NY Yankeees fan, and a great pail to put ice and about 5 beer bottles...or anything you choose. Wonderful quality...but tiny dent from metal being knocked around in the shipping process."
4,"Great book, great price","I gave 4/5 stars only because the book had underlines and highlighting and the book was marked ""clean"" -- but hey it's a used copy and that happens sometimes. Seller is fantastic, ships fast, will definitely do again."
5,A favorite bedtime read,This book reminds me of all the things that attracted me to Jesus and still fascinate me. Ways to apply principles in a well-thought-out and succinctly explained essay form. So relevant for the spiritual seeker.
5,Solid Theory Text,"This is a good solid Music Theory text. I have used it with my classes now for over three years. I differ on a few things, such as the blues scale definition, but overall for traditional theory, it's a good book. Useful as a reference too."
1,Don't buy - no page numbers!!!,"Amazon recently ""updated"" this version taking away the page numbers and changing them to locations as they do with books (and should NEVER do with text books) making it virtually impossible to follow your instructor and class. Haven't been able to figure out how to go back to the old version. So disappointing. So incredibly difficult to keep up in class."
2,Super worn,"The cover of the book has almost completely separated from the spiral. The pages have suffered significant water damage. I am unsatisfied and will not purchase from this retailer again. I will either have to find some way to re-bind it before the school year starts or purchase an all new textbook. If the product description had been more accurate, I would not have purchased this book."
5,penquin companion to classical music,"This is a very worthwhile book to have. I am so glad to have purchased one since it is now out of print, maybe they should consider reprinting another edition."
1,This is mostly just alcohol.,Doesn't work like other bloodroot paste I've used for moles.It's mostly alcohol and hydrocloric acid. I'm not even sure how much bloodroot is in it.
4,Good product,"A good price for this item. My only concern is that it's not pure, it has other ingredients in the bottle."
4,Great Book!,"I'm interested in naming my children with unique names with an African decent. Unlike others, the book truely reflect what I was looking for in a book of African names. Since African names are hard to pronounce, I was impressed how they took the time to input how to pronounce the names into the book."
1,very unsatisfied customer,"Received My battery for use with a Sony 505 series.battery worked when received ... powered laptop for about an hour..Never accepted a charge, and never worked again after that in either of two 505-series laptops available for testing."
3,Good Book,"Part 1: Overview of International Etiquette(...)Part 2: North America and South America<(...)Part 3: Eastern and Western Europe(...)Part 4: Asia & the Pacific Rim(...)Part 5: The Middle East(...)Includes a glossary, a list of recommended books to read and a list of its contry's embassies including addresses and phone number where you can contact for more infomation.I rated this book 3 stars because I don't know if everything in this book is correct. So my recommendation is to check out different sources to make sure you know the proper etiqutte if you are wondering about the proper etiquette for that country."
1,"For Idiots, Indeed","I'm a German living in the U.S., so naturally, I scanned through the section dealing with Germany. What I found was a list of factual errors and stupid stereotypes. I could not read a single sentence without either cringing or laughing hysterically. It's all so very wrong. I doubt if the author has ever been to Germany, or has ever talked to someone who has been to Germany.As a positive aside, the title is very descriptive. Follow the book's advise, and people will take you for a complete idiot."
5,Bando 6PK2385 OEM Serpentine Belt,I gave 5 stars because I've used Bando belts before.I like Bando because they fit like the OEM belt.I highly recommend this product.
2,Cheap material,"This shirt is not made of quality cotton, nor screenprinted well. I always wash shirts in cold water and hang dry. This shirt only made it through about 4 wash cycles. Now the logo is nearly faded away and the material has a rough feel to it."
4,BMW Shirt,As expected a good quality T shirt. Size was accurate. Screen print OK. Same shirt without the ultamite driving experiance is $9 at BMW dealers.
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,I was disappointed to learn that the Ion pen I ordered did not come with the lanyard. The picture on the website showed the aurora blue Ion pen packaged with a lanyard. BUYER BEWARE! stephjoe: I am an unsatisfied customer.
1,Trash On The First Day,I have owned this computer for three years. It has not been able to do anything other then slowly surf the web. The Cd Drive didn't run well.. had it replaced twice. Would not recommend this computer. It is soon headed for scrap yard. Buy Dell.
5,"An impressive, scholarly, in-depth biography","Hugh Lane: 1875-1915 by journalist Robert O'Byrne is an impressive, scholarly, in-depth biography of British art dealer and patron Hugh Lane, who earned his way from poverty to fame and respect as a specialist in the great art of the old masters. His work in the creation of public art galleries in South Africa and the Municipal Gallery of Ireland earned him lasting prestige and some controversy, until his unfortunate death on the Lusitania when it was sunk by a Germans in 1915. Hugh Lane: 1875-1915 is the fascinating life-story presentation of a man who lived, worked, and devoted himself to the trading of art."
5,The gospel according to Willett,"This book changed my life. After reading it, I gave up dieting and lost 104 pounds. I had all the carbs, fat and flavor that I wanted and still lost weight...every last pound of it. This is not a diet book, it is not a cook book...It is a logical explanation of food and how the body uses it...it will revolutionize the way you eat. Thank you Dr. Willett!...you saved my life."
3,"Easy to read, great info","I've enjoyed Dr. Willett's book. The reading is easy and was very informative for me. He gives a few recipes to follow and that is my criticism: I think he should have given a month's worth of meal plans. Sometimes leaving everything up to the reader to put together is just too much. We need a little more guidance. I did feel like I've learned quite a bit about good fats vs bad fats, since I came from the mind set of ""all fats are bad"". I will recommend this book to my friends and I believe he has a ""diet"" book out with more recipies and I will look forward to that."
5,"Eat, Drink and Be Healthy","Book was presented as used, but appeared to be new. Delivery was quite fast.Easy to order."
4,"Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy","This book is a refreshing change regarding health and nutrition. His pyramid is the first to focus on the fact that weight control and exercise are as important to your overall health as the foods you eat. It once again shows that the fat free era that has made everyone obese is incorrect and that there are healthy oils we all need. He mentioned the fact we are not all the same, we are like snowflakes, each person being different and you need to find what works best for you, using the guidelines put forth in the book. Anyone wanting to know the latest correct information should read this book. It is full of common sense and honest scientific facts."
3,Not sure,"A lot of what the author says makes sense, but I have a hard time understanding why, if what he is saying is accurate, there aren't more people out there pushing his ideas."
2,Another cookbook,"This is an OK type of cookbook but it is one among hundreds most of which contradict each other. Thus, the poor consumer has a difficult time making any sense of it all. There should be many fewer but much better cookbooks/diet plans/nutritional schemes, etc."
1,"Eat, drink and be healthy","Felt the material it was printed on was cheap, print small and blurred. I would not buy this book either for myself or as a gift."
2,Not What I thought It Would Be,"[[ASIN:B001W5AM28 Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy: The Harvard Medical School Guide to Healthy Eating] I had a copy of a book with this same title. I must have lent it to someone anyhow I can't find it. I purchased this one from Amazon it seems to be a different printing. I don't remember it in this format. There seemed to be more useful information, my other copy was a paperback also. I suspect this copy is an older printing. Look for the Paperback version I believe it is better, more up to date."
5,Excellent Book for those who have Plateaued,"If you are looking to lose weight, understand nutrition, or simply want to break out of your current routine and achieve a higher level of satisfaction from the foods you eat, this book is for you. I lost 60 lbs on a low calorie, low fat diet, but it was difficut at times. If only I had read this book first. Although much of the book seems to mirror what Dr. Barry Sears said years ago in the Zone, this book's views on Protein, Carb sources, and fitness seem to be more reality based and easy to understand. Also, Dr. Willett is level headed and does not sound preachy. Probably the best book I have purchased in the last year."
3,"Eat, Drink, and Be Healthy as we understood a while back","There's useful information in this book and some good recipes. I was disappointed, however, and have to take it's recommendations with a grain of salt (!) because it was published in 2001 as strong support for the pyramid new at that time. There's been lots of critical research and new finings since then."
4,OH that's how it works,"Excellent book on how your body uses various vitamins, enzymes, and food to it's advantage or disadvantage with a further explanation on what foods do. Other then that it basically says what we all really know and that is if you put a lot of the wrong food and fat in you, you will get fat!"
4,Fatty Liver Disease (non-alcoholic),A good book to get your liver back on track... KISS principle is applied so the suggestions are easy to digest.
5,Great book!,"I thoroughly appreciated this book. It gave so much great info, from various study findings to info on the revised food pyramid (along with what is wrong with it). I have been interested in food/health for years now and it is really important to have solid science to back up my food choices. The aspect of the book I liked best, was that the information was presented, but it left the decision up to you. It is so important that people don't just read something in a book and take it as gospel, but that they investigate, ask questions, and talk to their healthcare providers. If you want facts, not the latest fad diet, read this book."
2,Cheesy!,"The plot was ok in this book but she never went anywhere with it. It was cheesy in my opinion. If you can buy it used, it would make a good quick read I guess...don't pay full price tho."
2,Don't bother,"This book was a waste of time. The synopsis on the back cover has very little to do with the actual plot of the book. I expected to read a story of a lesbian's battle with the armed forces, what I got was a love story. A love story that had nothing to do with the character talked about in the synopsis. It also was too quick and not very substantial."
3,Chile and Easter Island are much more than that,"I certainly expected more. The tour of Chile and Easter Island was probably based on what others told the host. He missed the Chungara Lake (one of the highest in the world). There was little mention of the Lake Region in the South, a breath-taking scenery for Nature lovers. The host tries to keep us entertained with comments on the rodeo, the delicious Pisco sour, the long bus rides, etc. There is a problem with the person who added the music to the video... Chile is extremely rich in folklore, but no Chilean music accompanies the video. The video brings great memories of a beautiful country, but too much was left aside (beaches, rivers, the Andes! )"
5,Most informative & entertaining documentary on cuban cigars,"A historical documentary on Cohiba the crown of Cuban Cigar empire with detailed tour of the cigar factories. Very well done, I very much enjoyed behind the scene events of how Fidel Castro gives his personal account of how he participated in the birth of Cohiba."
3,Thai life,"I lived in Thailand for seven years,my friend was Thai boxer,went to Lumpini for matches.The story and acting are excellent and true to life. Just wish format of disc was up to HD full screen quality.True life,Good,"
3,not bad at all,well good story line it is vary interesting the fight could have been better . but guess really was abut the man journy into his real self I give it a thumbs up wish it was in englsh but the sob titles were good it is a art film the a action move . action in a arts film but good.
5,Hurrah for Rudolph!,"I've been watching the special since it premiered in 1964. These are very cute figures that could be used as tree ornaments; they also have a clip on them that would make them suitable for keychains, if you wanted them to get that beat-up with everyday use. Let me clarify which characters are included here, though, since the photo shows the Charlie in the Box included and the description says Clarice is with the set. The set actually includes the Bumble, Hermey, the cowboy on the ostrich, Donner, Mrs. Donner (it's not Clarice; Clarice has the bow), Mrs. Santa, Santa in his workshop clothes, the tall elf and the short elf, Sam the Snowman, adult Rudolph and baby Rudolph. No Yukon Cornelius either. These are well molded and strongly resemble the original characters. Great for Christmas decorating."
4,"Very, very good!","My Braun, Norelco-Philips, Wahl, Panasonic, etc. look fancy, work good, properly....but my Shaveman (now out of business) and CLIO work VERY good.No expensive shaver had removed all my whiskers - there are always a few of them at the border between my nose and upper lip - BUT NOT WITH CLIO AND SHAVEMAN!!aND THE PRICE IS SO LOW....."
1,Not good at all,"The manufacturers do not reply to your email. They will not deliver the product to you. Do not make the same mistake as i did by ordering for this product, you will simply end up waiting for this product forever."
3,"It runs on AAA batteries, thats what I needed.","This razor arrived very quickly, with a 7.99 price tag from Rite-Aid attached to the front. $2 cheaper there it appears. Regardless, this razor, though dinky and not an amazing shave, is very lightweight. It runs off AAA batteries, which was exactly what I needed. It will work as a travel razor, as long as that travel isn't for work. I plan to take it on long vacations. I gave it 3 stars because I wouldn't voluntarily use it, but I would definitely choose it over a razor blade / non electric razor."
5,perfect,ordered to replace my old-cracked yellow oem lights. they were easy to install and look great. good fit. just wish the bulb that included was for the same model as the lamp!
4,Much better.,Fit perfectly into my bumper with no problem and they look a lot better than my hazed over stock light. For some reason the bulbs supplied made my signals freak out so I just used the bulbs I already had in.
3,"The movie is enjoyable, streaming wasn't","It's a fun movie, great for kids, lots of slap stick humor.Had problems with the streaming though which interrupted our movie (I checked my connect, and the problem was with Amazon not my connect which was average over 25 Mbps at the time). Don't mind poor streaming as much when its prime, but when I just paid for it I get unhappy, it ruined family movie night."
3,Mild Comedy,"Having just discovered that Mr. Atkinson is a major star worth a great deal of money, I imagine many who might read this are fans of previous work. For them, I should think, this will be a diverting exercise with a variety of verbal and visual laughs. For those with no such connection to him, I should say that this is a minor comedy built on a bumbling secret agent. It has some laughs, is generally lightly amusing, and is of a length which doesn't permit boring stretches. Supporting players add a measure to the pleasure. All in all, nothing to go out of the way for, but not tedious. Not a bad way to spend less than an hour and a half."
4,Very Funny!!!,"I grew up watching Rowan Atkinson play Mr. Bean, and I thought he did a very good job as being a spy who usually has no idea what he's doing! Johnny English must figure out who stole the Crown Jewels, and deal with a villian named Pascal Sauvage who tries to become king. English receives help from another spy named Bough and a beautiful woman named Lorna Campbell. Can the incompetent British spy stop this bad guy? I highly recommend JOHNNY ENGLISH!!!"
3,Funny in its own way...,"This movie definitely has its moments, but it pales in comparison to any of his other work. If you purchase the movie expecting Black Adder or Mr. Bean type antics, then you'll be disappointed. Still worth having in my collection of Rowan's works, but not his best in my opinion."
4,Atkinson Did It Right!,"Despite what many people have said, this movie is extremely funny and original. It is true that spy movies have been done before, for example Austin Powers. Just because it has been done before, doesn't mean it has been done right. Rowan Atkinson got it right. From start to finish I was laughing at his quirky humor. He can do both physical comedy and at the same time act the part of a bumbling agent to perfection. This is a must have DVD if you like comedies!!!"
2,Don't get your hopes up,"The best part of this movie had to be the Aston Martin Vantage. I will admit the chase scene with the car was unique.I had high expectations after learning of the involvement of the writers of the last two Bond movies. I had expected a lot more subtle humor than slapstick.The movie is ok and certainly acceptable for a family evening film. Oh yeah, and Natalie would make a good Bond girl too!"
4,Great Schtick!!,"I've always enjoyed UK humor. This movie is right in the ballpark with Airplane, Naked Gun, and Animal House. If you're into that, this is a great movie."
4,A must for Rowan fans!,"A fun, clean, family movie that's a must for fans of Rowan Atkinson. Hard to find movies like this that stay clean and enjoyable all the way through. I applaud the filmakers and the cast for making such a movie. And who can resist Rowan's brillant physical comedy? He's one of the best in that area. I give it a 4 out of 5."
4,Is it perfect? No. Is it funny? Bloody right!,"This film reminds me a little of Pink Panther, a little of Don Knotts, and lots of Bean. It's silly humor at the highest. There are jokes for all, though some won't like them all. A few of the jokes were in the gutter which will offend the easily offended. But Bond (the series this parodies) would offend those people as well, so I doubt they're going to be seeking out Johnny English. The DVD is fine. It looks great, sounds great, and has a few nice extras. I always like deleted scenes, but this would have been a perfect film to have a blooper real. All in all...well worth the $. Especially considering it makes for a wonderful party film, no one saw it at the theater, it's really funny, and you could make a drinking game. Start with a drink every time English falls down or every time Malkovich says ""English"" with his silly accent."
3,"Good movie, bad DVD","This review is not about the movie but the disc...I like Black Adder and Mr. Bean DVDs. I would have liked this one too but it starts with a bunch of previews (Bring It On, etc) and while it says I am allowed to fast forward through them (but not chapter skip or use the menu button - WHY NOT?) it won't actually let me do that.Having to watch the same previews every single time I put in the DVD is unbearable!"
1,It was disappointing.,"Rowan Atkinson is hilarous as Mr. Bean. I could not stop laughing when I watched ""The Rat Race"". I was in the mood to laugh so I rented this movie. After 20 minutes, I stopped watching it. I found it to stupid. The scene at the gravesight was to ridiculous for words. After seeing the scene with Rowan trying to investigate how the thieves got away with the jewelry was just plain dumb. I could not waste any more of my time watching this movie."
2,Silly British Humor,"This movie is ok. It probably would be more funny if I were British, since they have such a dry wit. It kept me interested, not laughing, by interested in seeing how it ended. Probably never watch it again but at least I don't feel as though I've wasted a few hours of my life watching it."
4,Johnny English (an americans point of view),"This movie was funny from the start, however it could also be put as really stupid humer almost as low as Austin Powers. but it had a bit moore sence to it but it was on the line of the old time hit comedy Get-Smart!!"
1,Huge Disappointment!,I loved Mr.Bean but Johnny English is just not funny. Even my 8 year old was unimpressed. My husband a huge fan of British comedy was very disappointed.Poorly acted and scripted. I am glad it was a rental. Only received a 1 because the rating system won't allow anything lower.
3,One star for each big laugh,"My wife and I rented this movie because we usually find Atkinson to be pretty hilarious. Unfortunately, he falls well short in this effort, a spoof on spy films. To put it bluntly, I think they expect too much of him in this film. He does not possess the comic genius of say a Peter Sellers, to pull it off.Sure there are some pretty funny scenes, but the laughs are too few. The movie even stoops to bathroom humor to try and get some laughs, but even this tactic does not really work very well. Therefore, I would not recommend this movie unless you are really in the mood for a spy parody type film. While Atkinson's humor is much cleaner than Mike Myers, the film is also a lot less funny than any of the Austin Powers movies."
3,"""Mr. Bond, Mr. Bean.""","Rowan Atkinson is one of our great comic treasures. With his hangdog looks his sense of visual and verbal slapstick is impeccable. Even in cameos in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Love, Actually"" he steals the spotlight. ""Johnny English"" is an OK film with it's fair share of laughs. The ersatz Bond by way of Clouseau plot doesn't add anything new to the spy comedy genre. This is far from a bad film just a tad disappointing. I give ""Johnny English"" a marginal recommendation but Atkinson is best represented onscreen in the hilarious ""Mr. Bean's Holiday""."
1,How the mighty have fallen.,"I loved Black Adder for the wit and Mr. Bean for the innocence. So what we have here is a film where we mix the BAD points of both characters (Blackadder's willingness to lie, cheat and otherwise be a complete bounder; and Mr. Bean's utter stupidity) for laughs. No laughs erupt, however, and soon this film begins to feel like an embarressing exercise in making a quick buck. First ""Mr. Bean - The Movie"" (which died an ignominious film death) and now this! Rowan, dear heart, stick with television."
1,this movie is GAY,The plot sucks. Mr.bean sucks. The movie sucks. The actors suck. The villan sucks. The DVD sucks. The sountrack sucks. The credits suck. you suck. The title sucks. The story line sucks. The jokes suck. The best part was at the end of the movie where i shut the damn trash off.
1,"QUITE THE OL' RUBBISH, I MUST SAY","After paying for this film with my well earned money ($12), I found myself, a Bean fan, coming across a really incompetent and dumb movie that was trying way too hard for laughs. The ""idea"" was funny-a bumbling superspy, but with the stupid jokes and silly dialouge, it became a super ""plop"". Too bad, since the Bean series was better. Anyways, what was Malkovich (a great actor) doing in it? Come on Malkovich-Malkovich! And to think that Rowan Atkinson still is a funny guy. Oh....ha....ha....ha.Pidgeon poop.M.J.in the northern hemisphere, somewhere..."
2,DOESN'T PASS THE SMELL TEST,"There's a reason this movie bombed at the box office. It stinks. Mr. Bean has a go at playing Bond in this mildly amusing spy spoof. After having (...)erotic dreams about being Agent One, Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) indirectly kills Agent One by providing faulty entry codes for one of his missions. Later, at Agent One's funeral, the rest of the agents are blown into oblivion when Bean allows a bomb to slip into the funeral in Agent One's coffin.From there the film deteriorates into Bean's bumbling attempts to recover the stolen Royal Crown Jewels. Few laughs and if you're watching too late at night you'll be fighting the impulse to fall asleep. Not too offensive for the kiddies, though.Save your money."
2,When Mr Bean plays Leslie Nielsen's type of humour,"I love MR BEAN and I was impatient to get this movie. Okay it's not a masterpiece and you will not laugh all the time but you will have a good time wathcing it.Malkovitch is the funny nasty French (By the way it's French accent is quite poor :) and Imbruglia is the MR Bean Girl. Influenced by James Bond of course, the story has been already seen quite often and the jokes are more into those Leslie Nielsen could have done ! I just hope Rowan Atkinson in Mr BEan role for his next movie.It's still watchable !"
5,I can't beilve they showed the Arch-bishop's BUTT!!!!,"This movie had some things in it that I dfidn't mind, really, but for a PG movie they were pretty inapporipate.But ovewrall, it's a very funny movie."
3,mmovie review,We got what we ordered and have enjoyed it. We could tell the signs of it being used and I think it took a little longer to receive it than what I expected.
2,Not that funny,A lot of the comedy was predictable. A lot of it was tedious.The funniest scene was the fast-paced car and truck chase scene which unfortunately turned into the tedious and painful funeral scene.I watched it as an Amazon Instant Video which doesn't provide any extras or subtitles. I find subtitles useful for undertanding heavy accents and whispered speech. You get more bang for the buck by buying a used DVD.
5,VERY FUNNY!,"Tjis is a very funny movie! I was laughing my head of when I saw it at the theater. At first I didn't want to see this movie at all, but it was greater than I expected."
1,Difficulties with DVD playback,Tried playing this DVD on an older Hitachi DVD player and on my computer. It was a 'no go' right from the start. Playback froze up on the DVD player and jumped around on the computer. I suppose this is the result of some brain-dead anti-piracy feature. Rowan Atkinson could play the role of the Universal exec who thought that up!
2,is this supposed to be hilarious?,"there were only a few parts that were funny. utterly disappointing, even with Rowan Atkinson in it."
2,Quite the letdown.,"This movie was funny and interesting for the first five minutes, and from that moment it was just a steady downward spiral towards boredom and redundancy.Besides, Rowan Atkinson doesn't make the sexiest of hero's to fall in love with as he smashes into the wrong buildings, and constantly bumbles around destroy 'covert' operations.I expected more, but for once the trailer was funnier than the movie, and frankly, thats never a good thing. You'd rather sit and watch the trailer three times over than spend uninteresting time over the whole movie.For children maybe this would be interesting, but not for us that expect more out of a film. Quite a letdown, because I waited a long time to see this movie come out to DVD.I think my heart is breaking.....no wait....nevermind, that was just my eyelids flickering open for a brief moment."
1,Unbearable,"Not a single laugh! Rowan Atkinson has great talent, but it is wholly wasted here. The script is hopelessly inept. This is a model of poor film making."
5,Laugh a minute,The funniest movie I have seen in years. Even better that the original Johnny English. Rowan Atkinson is brilliant. Unfortunately the best scene of the movie was relegated to the credits.
5,Johnny English,"I'd seen this movie a few years ago and knew it would be a fine addition to my already large DVD collection. Rowan Atkinson has just the right facial expressions to pull-off this James Bond spoof-film. I'd consider him a comedy genius, and recommend this to just about anyone that enjoys a good laugh."
4,"good movie, funny, and good action","for a comedy, Johnny English has some pretty good action sequences. movie isn't hilarious, but it's entertaining.and like someone else said, some of the jokes do get old at times, but it's still a good movie.and with a secret spy agent name like Johnny English, you can't go wrong. i LOVE that name. also has good acting from singer Natalie Imbruglia and John Malkovich, who plays the villian, Pascal Sauvage.movie only runs about an hour and a half, but DVD includes deleted scenes, one of which they definetly should have left in...LOL, spy tips, quiz on the movie, and an awsome movie character profiles.again, movie isn't hilarious, but it's good and enjoyable.i really hope they continue the Johnny English story with a part 2. special features also includes a making of the Johnny English feature that tells of the origin of the Johnny English story."
4,"A good old ""Bean""","Rowan Atkinson is very funny in this ""Mr Bean meets James Bond"" comedy. Plenty of pratfalls and camera mugging together with the inevitable English toilet humor. And I mean TOILET humor literally! The ever-popular ""take over the world"" plot is given a slight twist thanks to the twisted characterisation of John Malkevich (alias Pascal Sauvage)and his droll patience with the inept Johnny English's attempts to thwart his plans make for some head-shaking chuckles. This is a film that all the family can enjoy and the kids are especially tickled by Johnny English's ability to rise above his own ineptitude. Lots of belly laughs and good fun.(Based on the theatrical release in Australia)"
4,Nice detail,"I enjoyed reading this. Granted, i did not go through it like a novel, but by reading bits here and there, i eventually completed the book.There are some sections that get very technical. It gave us insight on the ins and outs of suspension.I recommend this to anyone racing, pit crews, mechanics or even hobbyists who just want to know about the racing they watch on TV. But i highly recommend drivers read this so they can give clear feedback to the crews."
3,Killer!,"A very good murder mystery. However, this is not the funniest performance Abbott & Costello put on. One of the better stories for an Abbott & Costello movie. This movie reminds me much of ""Clue"" and has it's similarities to the Pink Panther's ""Shot In The Dark"". Overall this is a fine movie for murder mystery fans but if you're looking for laughs there aren't as many in this one. Try ""Rio Rita"", ""In The Navy"" or ""Time Of Their Lives""."
2,Too negative,"Bleah. I thought the introductory passages, in which Ruby is dumped on for being too loud and obnoxious, were really kind of harsh and unpleasant. If you were reading this book to a kid who is rowdy and loud, in hopes of teasing them into self-awareness, chances are you'd only wind up making them feel really bad about themselves. In addition to the mocking emotional tone, I also didn't like the structure and feel of the book -- just didn't like it. (Axton)"
1,Didn't work for me !,"I had no luck getting this to pick up digital signals. I tried everything. A pair of old rabbit ears lying on the entertainment center picked up 4 digital stations. When I held them up I got 6. This thing with both UHF & VHF -- and amplification -- picked up only 1 station intermittently. I returned it. Yes, it's made in China."
3,not as good as PHDTV3 for me..,"bought this to replace PHDTV3 Indoor powered antenna. I live about 1/2 hr away from the towers in a townhouse. I found that the philips High performance(HP) antenna wasn't as good as the PHDTV3. I can pick up more channels with the PHDTV3, than the HP antenna."
3,OK for big city use but does not cut it in smaller markets,"Finding the right Antenna for your HDTV is really a mix and match because depending on your situation you either get all signals, some or none. Does this antenna work, yes on three out of six local stations. If the signal is weak then the amplification failed. If you live in a big city and need something better than just rabbit ears this will do. If you have some low power stations, spend a little more."
1,Didn't work for me,"Broadcast TV reception in my area is admittedly very difficult: only two channels are available using cheap rabbit ears. Unfortunately, the Philips amplified antenna produced no improvement. In fact the weaker of the two available channels was slightly worse with the Philips model. I'd hoped it would bring in a couple more local broadcast channels, but no such luck. The cable installer comes tomorrow."
2,disappointing,I live about 20 miles SW of the Empire State Building transmitters. I thought this item might improve analog reception and maybe also pick up some hdtv broadcasts. No such luck. I'm sticking with my 13-yr old Recoton amplified antenna. I'm not picking up hdtv stuff but at least the old Recoton makes analog broadcasts decently watchable.
1,Unit DOA,I can't really say whether this unit was good or not. It did not work on either of the two TV's that I tried it on. My first clue should have been the arc that kept sparking every time I connected the power jack to the unit. NOT a happy customer here... Unit promptly returned to vendor... I will not order another of this brand...
1,Poor Plastic Construction,"Antenna connection broke off while screwing cable on. Thin metal contact underneath glued to plastic frame. Could not be reconnected. Product trashed. The antenna did come with instructions that helped me figure out to attach my old Sharp TV to the new converter box, but I can not recommend the antenna."
3,Does NOT work for towers 20 miles away,"This antenna will not lock on to signal from towers more than 20 miles away. It is clearly written on the box as such, but the description from Amazon is missing this crucial information. I am located about 28 miles away from Sutro tower in San Francisco. This antenna was not able to lock onto any of the signal from Sutro. However it was able to lock onto signals from Stockton about 7 miles away. It'll probably work fine if you live within 20 miles radius of the broadcast tower, but if you are not, look elsewhere."
3,Ok,"I owned another indoor antenna before this one and that was even worse. This is better compare to the other one but still have problems. If I know it is still going to give me problems, I would just buy an outdoor one instead. I live on the second/top floor in a private house so the reception should be better but I guess not. Maybe it's the area I live in (Brooklyn, NY)."
3,Just Okay,"I've owned this antenna for roughly 8 months. I used it with my old computer monitor turned into TV for some months. The reception was okay, I definitely had to fiddle with it to make some channels appear clearer. It was not able to get all the local channels available. When I used it with a DTV converter box, I noticed a great improvement in image (largely due to the converter box). However, compared to a cheap antenna we had lying around, the signal strength of this antenna was not as strong as that of the cheaper antenna (no-name brand). I got signal loss more often than I cared for so I just switched to the cheap antenna. I do not whole-heartedly recommend this antenna, it is pricey and cheaper (albeit uglier) models can do a better job."
2,Not as great as others have said;,"Perhaps it's hit or miss; however the unit, in my opinion, is overpriced. I'd be willing to pay $20 for it tops. The unit feels cheap and does not perform as great as one would expect given the price tag.The reception is not acceptable; I receive 3 HD channels out of about a dozen."
3,Not so hot,"This unit was an improvement over plain rabbit ears on my HDTV set, but just barely. However it works fairly well on my analog set. The model DB2 made by Antennas Direct solved my HDTV problem."
1,AWFUL!,"My family and I recieved this product expecting to pick up more channels than the 10-12 channels our old OPTIMA did. We were very disappointed. We got more channels with the unit turned off. We decided to ship it back after testing it for only five minutes. This thing is a piece of junk and not worth the $35. We decided to return to the OPTIMA, which is on and running very smoothly right this moment."
4,Get all my HD Stations(sometimes),"I'm revising my review.I do get all stations for my area,with clouds it receives a weak signal and the picture gets weird on alot of stations.I would not recommend this antenna,I'm returning it to Wal-Mart.Honestly my reception is better with a piece of coaxial with about 6 inches stripped off and hung it on the latch on my patio door lol most stations are off the chart now but some are not that great.Still looking for something better.Happy antenna hunting!"
1,High Performance not seen.,I bought the Philips to replace an older powered indoor antenna. I expected some improvement in reception. The older powered antenna is 10 years old and was rated at less than half the db gain. I saw no difference in reception on all channels from 2 to 66 and this was running the Philips at full amplification. I also had to run the Philips at full amplification to match to match the older antenna. Very disappointed.
1,Very Poor Choice for VHF,"Bought one of these antennas for DTV use about a year ago. Had a lot of trouble picking up stations that my older (broken) rabbit ears got just fine. The UHF section worked great - it was the VHF part that didn't work well. Quit using it after about a month and bought a Terk HDTVi unamplified antenna (cheaper, too) that works great.I work at a local TV station and after the analog shutoff we got a lot of calls from people with problems. At least 10 viewers I personally talked to that had bought this antenna were having problems. When we talked them into getting something else their issues went away. (All were related to pickup of VHF stations.)So if you only need to pick up UHF stations, it would be OK. If you need to see VHF stations I would NOT RECOMMEND this antenna. There are cheaper units on the market that perform much better than this one."
1,Worse than old rabbit ears,"Recently purchased this product to see if it would provide my dad with better reception on his older analog TV. He had some old rabbit ears taped to the TV and couldn't get some stations. He is in an urban situation with TV stations no more than 25 miles at best, most closer. The Phillips product was actually worse than the rabbit ears at both UHF and VHF channels. Amplification did not help at all. Definetly useless and returned."
2,Amplify what?,"Take a look at that antenna. It measures approximately 7x5 inches. That's not much of a signal gatherer. Once gathered, amplifying it does no good. Multiply (amplify) 0 by ten and you get 0! Also, this antenna boasts a 50 db gain from amplification. This is not true. It only gives about 30.Save yourself time, money, and frustration by buying the Eagle Aspen DTV2Buhf antenna. The DTV2Buhf antenna works great, and is actually smaller than the Phillips because you don't need to extend di-poles. The reception is much better with the DTV2Buhf, and believe it or don't, the 19"" x 13"" DTV2Buhf is quite attractive right out in the open. It looks good, and works great. This Phillips antenna disappoints in both respects."
3,The KISS Priciple wins again,"For those who don't know, KISS stands for Keep It Simple Stupid (or Silly if you want to be politically correct). Anyhow, before I tell you how lousy the product was for me, you should know that I live in one of the worst places to get OTA TV. My apartment is half basement, with trees all over the place, way up in the hills/mountains of Blacksburg, VA. That said, this thing was outperformed by a $10 set of plain old rabbit ears (no amp., no nothin'). With the old rabbit ears I can get a couple of analog channels with tolerable quality, and sometimes some digital channels (they're a little finicky for me). With the fancy pants $35 MANT-whatever I can get the same two analog channels but a lot fuzzier, and the Digital is non-existent. If you feel like trying it though, I wish you the best of luck. It seems to work well for some people but not me."
1,Phillips antenna,It didn't work very wellI ended up giving it away to someone else.I bought an old RCA ANT 1250 which I usedto have. The RCA picks up more signals.
1,don't buy it,"we bought it before the change and it worked poorly. We were always adjusting it-very frustrating. Now that the changeover to digital is done, we completely can't get cbs and abc. It's worthless and we need a new antenna!"
1,looks fancy works like a kick in the pants (badly),"yeah i bought this antenna because some guy in an amazon review said he had tried a bunch of different antennas for hd and he said this was by far the most effective. well now i have bought several antennae and this is a pretty crappy one. the antenna im using now is so basic, straight rabbit ears (terk model #TV1) i picked it up at circuit city for 15 or 20 bucks and it works pretty well id give it 3 stars but it is the most effective antenna of the three i have, im pretty sure hd was not listed on the box but it seems to do a good job at recieving a variety of stations. btw that terk rabbit ear antenna, its not even powered, so thats a plus. i would pay .75 cents for this antenna, and i would still feel a bit ripped.word."
2,"No better than a piece of wire (in my case, at least)","Might work for some people in some areas, but I just wanted to watch off-air tv in my office in NYC and in my case it proved no better than a short piece of wire! (that what I was using before I bought this!) I still only get a few channels, and the reception is still lousy!Seems kinda cheap too...and the telescopic antennas bend if you so much as look at them.The amplifier circuit actually made the picture FAR worse - for me it proved to be better with the thing unplugged from the power supply!"
3,Decent Indoor Antenna,"I'm not sure if others also experienced the following with this product. When the antenna is powered up with or without the amplification on (full blast or completely off), I get only a handfull of channels (about 5-6). However, when the antenna is powered off, I get about 19 channels. I've been watching OTA HDTV for about a month now without the antenna powered and it's been working great. I still think it is a bit odd why I would get more channels without the unit powered up, but it works well.I should note that it took me a while to figure this out, trying different configuration permutations. I almost sent it back due to poor reception. However, I'm glad that I was able to figure out a configuration that worked for me."
4,Works 40 - 60 miles from source,"At the time this was purchased, the Trek HDTVa was sold out everywhere. That was my first choice.Installed this antenna and it instantly pick up about 15 stations. After playing with it, found out is highly sensitive to placement. Often an inch this way or that way is difference between reception and no recption. It is also effected by extenal electronics like refridgerators and computers. If you do not mind taking time to place and aim this antenna, it works great."
4,"Worked great for me at 15 miles, not great at 30","I used this at a location 15 miles away from the broadcast towers, and every signal came in crystal clear, with a minimum of 70 signal strength. This was with amplification turned on to about 50%.I moved to another location 30 miles away from a different broadcast tower, and signals were only pulled in sporadically, at about 20-50 signal strength.So I would recommend this for anyone living 15 miles or less from the broadcast antennas, it was working wonderfully at that distance."
3,needs more work,"pros: goes with my tv, video and audio quality are greatcons: reception is poor. you have to move the antennas around for half the over the air channels which becomes annoying after a while.needs power to work"
1,not impressed,"So far I have only gotten 4 stations in a major metropolitan area and the signal was not stable. Perhaps I did something wrong; however, I am not yet impressed."
2,"Works, but Terk is far better","I used this antenna for a year near Chicago, and just got a Terk HDTVa. Please, don't wait a year like me. Get a Terk from the start.The Philips did work, but not well. It required constant adjustment, especially when changing channels and day/night transitions. You read right: at sunset, while watching a show, the reception would fade and would require the antennas to be adjusted. Also the signal strength on my Panasonic plasma varied a lot. I could get anywhere from 8% to 65% within a 60 second span without touching the antenna at all. It just could not ""lock"" onto a signal and keep it from pixelating.Save your time, get a Terk or any directional antenna."
3,Decent HDTV antenna,Pulls in good signal reception within 10-15 miles of mounted location. Have difficulty picking up signal plus 20+ miles.Overall the HD picture quality is good. Comparible to the GE Quantom Indoor Antenna.
4,One of the better amplified antennas,"I'm surprised at the fairly low rating this antenna has gotten. I have gone through a myriad of ""rabbit ears"" and this antenna is the best I have found so far. I actually have two now for a TV in the living room and one in the bedroom. What I like is that you don't need to re-tune every time you switch to a channel on a different band. No, it doesn't come close to an outdoor antenna mounted high up, but it does pull in all my local channels. Now that there are digital channels available, it also does quite good at pulling them in. I would certainly recommend this antenna to someone who is looking for a indoor solution."
3,Tough to say...,"It's hard for me to tell how good this antenna is. I set it up in mu appartment and tried various positions. The only station I could get to come in well was a Spanish Children's Chanel. Unfortunately I don't speak Spanish or have children. Doing further research, I found that from my location I would need a medium sized roof mount antenna. I imagine this would be good if you are in an appartment and have line-of-sight to a nearby transmitter. Otherwise go for a larger rooftop antenna."
3,An okay product,"I rate it as being ""just okay"" simply because I still have to perform manual adjustments when I switch from lower channels to higher channels (or vice versa). That was sort of disappointing since I had thought that by purchasing this particular model, I would not have had to do that. Other than that, the unit works very well. You'll get a clear picture, provided you have it set just right."
3,Offered great analog and marginal digital performance,"I recently purchased this antenna to upgrade from my 1970's rabbit ears. I was getting decent performance from my rabbit ears but wanted much better performance for DTV.In short the DTV performance was a wash. I LOST one dtv channel and gained another one.The analog performance however was very impressive. Previously snowy channels were crystal clear without even adjusting antenna position. This is probably meaningless as analog will be turned off Feb, 09.I was disappointed with digital reception as I expected a significant performance gain over the rabbit ears."
2,Poor VHF reception,"Purchased the Philips high performance indoor UHF/VHF HDTV Antenna, it works great for our UHF transmitted channels, but our Fox network Ch. 10 WALA which is much closer to my residence will not come in at all. It is the only chennel in our area that broadcast over VHF. Range from house to station is 15 miles."
2,Didn't work well for me either....,"Like others, I bought this after seeing the reviews. I already had a non-amplified Philips Antenna bought for around $10 which worked Ok but struggled to pick up some of the higher HDTV channels and occasionally lost signal on the main ones. I thought that this amplified version would solve it. However, this antenna did not pick up as much as the non-amplified one. It was in exactly the same position and I experimented by changing the position and settings but to no success. On putting back the non-amplified antenna, I picked up the channels again."
3,Philips indoor antenna,Not pleased with the performance of this indoor antenna at all. doesn't pull in HD like I was told it would. I only get 3 of the 6 local HD channels consistently and have to constantly move the antenna to get one of the ost three channnels in. 2 out ofthe 6 channnels have never been received in HD
2,Wasted $,"Works about the same as the cheap set of rabbit ears I already had. Needs adjusting for almost every channel, which sort of renders the TV's remote useless."
1,poor construction - poor reception,"This antenna offered only marginal improvement over the cheap-o $9 basic antenna I purchased at Radio Shack. Worse, the cable port, or whatever you call it in the back where you plug in the cable to the tv, becomes easily unscrewed from the housing when you connect the cable or move the antenna around to get better reception. In short, it falls apart easily. I bought two antennas at the same time. Both have this problem. This is a low quality product."
1,Absolutely Terrible!!!,"UPS delivered this to me today. I intended to use it in my condo to pick up a few basic channels that my RCA rabbit ears wouldn't (FOX, CBS, MYTV, CW)I got two out of those four channels to pick up. So I decided to move the poles around a bit to see if I could get the rest.And...the right pole snapped completely off! As in jagged metal tip. I was very gentle, and it still broke off...I want my $40 back. Don't waste yours."
1,Quite disappointing,"First let me point out that I do have a HDTV converter box. After one of the stations switched to digital in my area I was no longer able to receive it so I decided to try this antenna. What a major disappointed, 4 channels are unwatchable compared to the old Radio Shack Model: 15-1892 Catalog #: 15-1892 I've been using. The antenna feels very flimsy and fragile. I have tried 2 of theses antennas because the first one was broken in the box and I exchanged. The next step for me is to try an outdoor roof antenna."
1,"Buy a $5 one, it would be better than this!",This antenna didn't work hardly at all. My old broken one received more channels than this.
2,Not the best reception.,"With Philips antenna we were able to receive 13 channels in the area where Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna was picking up 17.It is possible that Philips antenna is just not for hilly Pittsburgh, PA.We were hoping to use it for the FM radio reception, but that would require and additional switch to redirect the output."
5,Good product,"I was able to get high quality pictures without problems, however I did not get as many channels as I would have hoped."
1,This Item Stinks,"I live on the north shore of Long Island. The reception stinks. I kept reading about how pure and uncompressed HDTV reception was via antenna... so i decided to take a gamble in the interests of technololgy.Well. I lost that gamble. The thing stinks. The antenna cannot catch on to a single broadcast flawlessly. There is No HD reception at all. There is Snow and wavy lines all over the picture. The worst part is.... my best channel.. reception-wise is Channel 8 news in Connecticut with Dan Petriw. If you know anything about news, you'd much rather watch Deb Petroske on WABC-NY 7 anyday."
3,Not sure what the excitement is all about.,"I bought this Philips High Performance amplfied Indoor, Outdoor antenna based on reviews of the product. Unless you live in a highly populated suburban area don't waste your money. We get the same channel 5 times. I'm not even sure I like the high def format. The picture is half the size of my screen. I would have bought a smaller tv. Shame on Direct TV for not giving existing customers a deal on high def equipment. When my contract is up, I will go with dish and embarq for my high def, home phone, high speed internet needs. Kudos to Philips for offering inexpensive alternatives."
1,BEWARE Does not work on Digital Transmission,"If you'll notice almost all of the positive reviews of this antenna are from 2007, before Digital TV became the standard. It no longer works for Broadcast TV so you are wasting your money. Think e bay not Amazon"
2,TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,"DON'T BUY THIS!!, its a joke, one channel with heavy snow and no color, FOGEDABOUDIT!!!, SUPER LOSER,"
2,Manufacturing quality: crappy,"Bought the MANT510 today. One of the antennas broke off the very first time I tried to rotate it. I didn't even have a chance to see how well it received HD broadcasts.I'll likely try it again with a replacement, but I'm very disappointed in what appears to be very low quality manufacturing."
1,waste of money,I rarely can get any signal with this thing. the actual antennas often just fall over so you can't adjust it very well. it has been a horrible experience. considering just adding a rooftop antenna.
5,works okay,just got this product. since i`m ready to dump cable. without the amplifed on i only got 9 channels with the amplifier on i got 14 clear channels now i live in carson city nv stations are in reno nv about 30 miles away the towers from what i see are around 20 miles away . i live in a double wide trailer. so yes it does the job.thats my 2 cents worth
2,Don't buy,"Form the info on the web, I found out the the Product not as good as I though, after I got & use the product."
3,Bought it to receive a digital signal on VHF frequency,"I live 10 miles from antenna hill, which transmits12 channels, of which only one is on a VHF frequency.I had no problem receiving the 11 UHF channels, usinga cheap wire loop UHF antenna, so I bought thisphilips antenna with the expectation that itsamplified rabbit ears would do the trick.I still couldn't receive that one VHF channel.However, I pluged my UHF loop into the ""cable""socket on the back of the philips antenna, and nowget all 12 channels. That's not in the manual.It took 10-days enroute to get the shipment fromToronto to WI. Any duties are prepaid, tho."
3,No better than a passive antenna,I live in a remote area surrounded by hills about 50 miles away from nearest TV station. TV picture came in grainy on most analog stations and had some pixelation of the digital feed using a regular passive indoor antenna. I tried the Philips to see if the amplification would help. It did not - the signal was no different than a basic antenna that cost a few bucks at a local closeout store.
1,Worse than rabbit ears,"I tried this out in the Peoria IL area. This antenna would not lock in all the local channels from any spot in the room. Changing channels meant moving the antenna around. I replaced it with a coat-hanger antenna that I made by watching the YouTube video. I placed that one on the floor in the corner. It worked great.I then tried it out in the Moline IL area. Again, it does not lock in all the channels. The YouTube design works great at 25 miles away from xmitters. I was disappointed with the Phillips corp."
1,Didn't work for me,I tried this antenna and it did not work at all. The antenna expects an input from cable/dish for amplication. I don't think the amplification works for off the air signals. I am going with TERK. I have it on my other television and it works very well.
2,Not as good as cheaper non-amplified antenna,"Perhaps there is some sort of manufacture defect for the more recent batches, the latest reviews are mostly negative. The MANT510 also did not pick up any station for me, but a $10 RCA antenna picked up everything. So do yourself a favor, try the cheap antennas out first.2 stars instead of 1 because I thought it looks nice.Oh, I live in Queens, NY, the towers are only about 7 miles away."
1,high performance?,"Although the product is very easy to attach,to me, the product is overrated in the performance area."
1,Cheaply made/Mine was defective,"I purchased this based on positive reviews. I can't say whether it was just a bad item or if all of them have this problem. When it arrived, I was dismayed to find that it was cheaply made. There are two connectors for your cables on the back- standard attachments for coaxial cable. They were so poorly attached that one came out of the antenna when I tried to remove the protective plastic cap! The other one snapped out when I tried to attach a cable. I returned it as defective. Now, the whole reason I had purchased it was to see So You THink You Can Dance, and I didn't want to miss the season premier, so I decided to see if it would work even broken. And I have to say, it did get good reception, even though it wasn't attached properly. I imagine if it was in good shape, I would have been happy. So I'd suggest seeing if other reviewers had the same problem I did before deciding whether or not to buy it."
1,"Product ok, but not sure it is truly better than old rabit ear","I ended up with returning this product, though product itself might be ok.Compare with old rabbit ear, it does not do any better, in receiving analog signals. I didn't check this one for digital signals. The adjustable gain does not help much. One thing I noticed is that those antennas claiming 50db really does NOT do any better than 20db antenna.I live about 20 miles from most stations, with both NTSC(analog) and ATSC (digital) tuners. Old rabbit ear can receive decent analog picture (without snowflake) in PBS, local NBC and CBS, if pointing to right respective directions, but showed ""no signal"" with digital signal."
5,Excellent Performance,"Bear in mind I purchased the Philips specifically for HD reception. I had a RCA 25dB antenna before I purchased the Philips 50dB. What an amazing difference. With the RCA, every time a car passed by my picture froze or was lost, and I was only able to get two HD stations that were iffy. Once I flipped the power switch of my new Philips on, I flipped. I now get five HD channels with solid results. I also suggest going to the antenna website Philips suggests in their literature. Plug in your zip code and it shows you a map of where the transmission towers are located in relation to your home. It takes the guesswork out of positioning your antenna. Two friends of mine ran out and bought the Philips after seeing the results I had. They were with me when I set it up. They both achieved the same great results as I did."
2,hd tv stinks,I tried the Phillips amplified indoor antennae and it is a pain.It seems for every channel you have to keep moving it or the picture breaks up or you lose the signal.It would seem if the tv industry is so anxious to foist hd tv on us they would develop an antennae that you could just plug in and it picks up the stations like old style tv antennae.i am tired of having my picture break up unless the antenna is set in exactly the correct position.Also the directions with the phillip antena are sparse to say the least.I am currently looking for a better antena but from the reviews of different antenna they all seem to have problems
1,Poor build quality,"The amplifier didn't make any observable difference in picture quality...I don't even think it was working. While removing a coax cable, the entire coax plug pulled right out of the antenna, leaving a gaping hole in the back of the unit and effectively destroying it.On the plus side, it folds up into a small package that doesn't take up much room once you throw it in the trash."
2,Was impressed at first but older rabbit antennas will do..,"I bought this at CC together with DTT900 Zenith digital tuner for my old CRT TV. Decided to check how this set-up would work before splurging for a new HDTV set. When i hooked up both antenna and digital tuner i was impressed. I got 44 total channels (digital and standard) with maybe at least 7-8 HD channels. But then when i tried to put in my old RCA rabbit antenna (not powered) in-place of this Philips antennna just to check, i got the same results and same number of channels picked-up. I'll be returning this right away and just save my money."
1,Rabbit ears with no boost have same effect,"I thought this product was so poor, I didn't want to rate it, but you have to place at least 1 star in the rating. I have a set of rabbit ears that get the same signal as the Philips Antenna. I would recommend not buying this product. The rabbit ears on this antenna fell off the platform when you extend them, they are not anchored in. As far as I'm concerned, Philips just pocketed an easy $40 with a poorly designed and poorly constructed pile of junk."
1,Huge Waste,What a waste of time and money. Save yourself the trouble and get a regular rabbit ears antenna. You'll get identical results. In fact my basic rabbit ears pulled in more digital channels than this so-called superior high-def amplified antenna.
3,Save your money.,"I own the $8.00 rabbit ears made by RCA and they receive and get the same amount of ch. that Philips did. I bought the Philips because I read reviews and hoped that since it was a powered model it would receive more. Well for me it didn't and if your wondering, I live in the North East surrounded by mountains but my point is that the cheap ones are as good for me. I am changing from cable to over the air with the Digital Converter Box and now get 10 ch. so thats good. Anyway the Philips is nice but not $20 extra nice. I plan on trying the DB8 soon but for now I will keep the cheapo's. RCA $8.00 10ch. Philips $29.00 10ch."
2,No better than a basic antenna,"I bought this antenna to try improving my HDTV reception in a crowded city. Unfortunately it was worse than the simple ear-and-hoop antenna I was using before. I compared digital signal strengths on my TV and no matter what I tried - position, angle, power - this antenna was inferior."
3,Overrated,"This antenna performed worse than the antenna I was attempting to replace. I was looking for a good HDTV antenna, what I got was the same old Uhf/Vhf...., I think the HDTV part was just added when HDTV became popular. Just use your rabbit ears or buy an outdoor antenna."
5,Great reception!,"I bought this with low expectations, but it really works. With the amplifier turned on, I can get all broadcast stations (ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, theCW, etc.) even though I live in a crowded area in Manhattan on a low floor.Btw - it doesn't receive anything without the amplifier."
3,Gain also decreases over time,"I have the same problem as ""lionelbob"". When left alone the LEDs showing the amount of gain slowly dim out. Gain goes down for some reason. He said Philips admitted some of the units are defective. This is a shame because using it I'm actually able to get every over the air HDTV broadcast in my area. When setting it up you have to keep in mind that position is absolutely a key to success. I have to place it on one spot of my tv stand and point the flat antenna out a window. Move the base a few inches either way, no go. Adjust the antenna 10 degrees either way, no go. Take your time in setting it up and you may be rewarded."
5,3 antennas in one.,"I'm saying 3 antennas in one because the left antenna is good for ch 3 & 5, right antenna is good for Ch 8 & 10 and center square is good for Ch 13, 21 & 33 all HD OTA channels I use and wanted.I tried 2 other indoor antennas before, the DA-001 and another antenna similar in design and they didn't work because they would pick up only half the channels if oriented one way and after adujsting, they would lose the first half, but with this MANT510 antenna I can adjust it so that I get ALL the channels with good signal strength.Signal strength used to be 65-75 with the other 2 antennas, but with this one I get all the channels with 75-85 strength (after minor tuning of course), big improvement, all my HD channels are clear and they don't break up, I live 10-15 miles from the Las Vegas strip, first floor apt."
3,It's the 1960s again,"I really appreciate the UHF performance on this unit. I'm just outside metro Orlando, Florida and several of the UHF channels come close in picture to that of the cable company signal. Lower powered UHF stations and those that are a bit further aren't quite as stable.VHF is miserable. There are 3 major stations and none of them are reasonably good. The best has acceptable audio but the video reminds me of the 1960s. It is an indoor antenna and I'm restricted from having an outdoor antenna because of the homeowners association, but there has to be better performance and a better design than simple rabbit ears."
3,Good but not great,"I've had this hooked up to a Hauppauge 1800 and Windows MCE for about a week now. It is able to pull in the digital ATSC from about 10 miles away through walls with an OK signal strenth (not great), and the reception on the NTSC non-digital channels is just tolerable. For ATSC, I dont need (can't use) the built in amplifier on the antenna and the antennas need to be adjusted just right to get enough signal. There is another antenna I've heard about and would be interested in looking into further, the Winegard SS 3000 Indoor UHF/VHF Antenna (SS-3000)."
3,sizing,i wear a size 12 shoe. I got the size 12 heelys but i think they are too small. I recommend you buy one size up. Though i wasnt sure if they are supposed to be tighter because your rolling around and you dont want to fall out of them.They are cool though once you get used to the balancing thing.
3,not really a saga,"I think this ""saga"" would not be consitered 1 really because it is only about 9 episodes long and not exackly the best"
5,beautiful.....,I find that this cd is the perfect mixture of music from the movie and the beautiful poetry of Pablo Neruda. The readers are wonderful and I especially enjoy this cd when I need to take a moment to myself. I find it is wonderfully relaxing to close my eyes and just imagine....
5,Music Poetry Romance,"Don't be put off by the negative comments judge for yourdelf as I did. I found this by accident looking for some romantic music for my lady and that is exactly what I found. Now I need to see the film. The music conjures up such a feeling, relax listen and enjoy. Imagine moonlight skys, the sea gently lapping along the shoreline,candlelit dinners with the one you love. This will leave you with a warm feeling and if not then you will not know romance. The poetry is warm sensitive and well read, a bonus to the CD."
1,Gushy,"I thought the poetry was going to be interesting, but it sounded sophomoric to me. I know it's a matter of taste, but this wasn't mine."
4,Poetry and Music together make this CD work!!,"the oral presentations of Neruda's beautiful poetry combined with the relaxing, passionate music from the soundtrack of the movie Il Postino make for a wonderful listening expirience!"
1,WHAT DID THEY DO?!,What is this trash?! This film is beautiful but the soundtrack sucks big time. They should have used the actor who was playing Pablo Neruda to read the poems in ITALIAN! It's a beautiful and romantic language but no..they screw it up with actors from the U.S. OMG! I HATE JULIA ROBERTS! she makes the soundtrack even worse. I spit on this cd! believe me..I would so give this trash 0 stars but amazon doesn't allow it!
4,King Lear as a Comedy of Manners,"Having read WARTIME LIES first, I was pleasantly surprised by this tragi-comic tale and Begley's impressive range. Like Lear, Begley's hero ""Schmidtie"" is a bad father and worse husband, but one we can't help feeling pity for, despite his frailties. And by the ending, it is hard not to cheer for Schmidt as he sails off into the sunset. If comedy is a fantasy of triumph, this one is tinged by palpable loss and the enduring self-deception of its hero."
3,Fascinating,"Schmidtie is probably someone I would avoid. He's an old-boy network, retired white-collar law firm partner, WASP - a touch bigoted - yet . . . very likable! Being a lawyer, I ususally rail against these types who make much about how I am an ""exception"" to my ethnicity. Nevertheless, I found myself rooting for the guy. Begley portrays a compelling character. The ending is a bit abrupt and sometimes it can be a little difficult to follow, but it's a good read."
4,"An attaching character, but the story has flaws","Schmidt is a grouchy old man, retired from his law practice, living in an expensive house on Long Island. He's an attaching character, and the story is interesting and compelling, but finally it is flawed. Schmidt is almost too cut and dried, and the plot is too simplistic - as he comes to terms with his daughter's impending marriage, he meets and falls in love with a twenty-something waitress.But above all, the story ends abruptly, as if the author didn't want to finish it, and rather make another book out of it. I'll probably read the sequel, but with some trepidation."
3,Mildly interesting; strange focus on finances.,"Not a bad book, and we understand that Schmidt has a lot of money, but to devote endless pages to his financial affairs becomes quickly tiresome. Okay, he's wealthy, we get it. Schmidt and his wife come across as money-obsessed poseurs, but are not entirely unlikable. In fact, Schmidt seems to be straining to be human except for weird moments like when his wife is diagnosed with a terminal disease and he is kind enough to see her into a cab before heading back to the office. Is that really, really weird or what?"
3,schmidtie ending,"I was enjoying this book until it came to an abrupt halt. The pages started turning more quickly toward the end because I was excited to find out what would happen with Schmidtie's steamy- (if not messy) affair.For a minute I thought the waitress and her boyfriend were in cahoots to somehow blackmail Schmidtie out of his greenbacks... Then, instant resolution? Did I miss something? Was I supposed to believe their's was a true (or at least meaningful) love? Did Begley just get tired of the whole thing?"
1,I would not recommend this book. Very uninteresting,This book left me empty and unsatisfied. The writing style is not engaging nor is the basis of the story
3,Heathy but not as pictured,"I ordered the String of Pearls succulent. This plant arrived with speedy shipment. Unfortunately it was not as pictured. The picture shows a plant with long tendrils that hang over basket. My plant was just enough to cover inside the pot and had a few tendrils that barely came over the lip of the pot. I decided to keep this because it appeared to be a healthy specimen. To sum it up, the picture is misleading."
1,NOT AS PICTURED and POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I purchased the 6 inch String of Pearls plant which I note is no longer available as of this date (8/09/08). Now I am beginning to better understand what happened with my purchase. A smaller plant was put in a 6 inch pot, leaving at least an inch of space between the plant and the plastic container. No soil was added to secure the plant during shipping. It arrived with ""strings of pearls"" broken off. It only had a few strings to begin with, not as was pictured. Pictures were sent to Hirt Gardens showing this. I was told I was wrong. Hirt Gardens responded ""the plant looked fine to me. just add some soil. the broken parts can be rooted if you like. just lay them on the soil."" No exchange of plants was offered nor was responsibility for a poor product accepted. They have lost my future business. Guess a picture is no longer worth a thousand words!"
3,Flat Everything,"The only reason, i suppose, this was done CGI was because it's 'popular'. But this story just goes like a clockwork device, all clicks & clanks. The voices are top-flight, but the backgrounds are as flat as the tale. *Only* for kids w/little imagination..."
4,From the POV of a 5 yr old,"I saw this movie in a theatre with my 5 yr old daughter and her friend. They both liked the movie and my daughter thought it was too short. She actually enjoyed it more than some other movies we had seen over the summer. She has watched the dvd a few times which is more than can be said of Madagascar, Herbie, and Sharkboy. It has storyline that is easy for younger kids to follow and it might actually inspire some kids to research the actual wartime pigeon squad. It was a cute movie and it's not impossible for parents to view with their kids. If you're a fan of the BBC ""The Office"" you'll enjoy the antics of one of the pigeons a little more."
2,Bland like British food,Valiant is as bland as British food. There's no real fun characters and the plot is obvious and has been done before. There are many better CG movies out there. Really disappointed.
1,this movie was hollow!,"The problem is not that this movie isn't a joint project between Pixar and Disney. It was pretty good in animation, but it was hollow! it made no sense! there is no plot. of course there is a plot but an extremely ridicolous one! If I were disney, I would not distribute this freak and would bury this freak for my own reputation. Dont even try to watch it. its totally waste of time and money."
1,Worst CG Disney movie ever!,"What a stinker! The writing is on the wall with this one. Disney tried to show Pixar it could do CG movies without them, and what a failure! And from the reviews Chicken Little is getting, it looks like 2 bombs in a row for the Mouse House. They seriously need to think about sticking to 2D animation, and leave the CG stuff to the professionals, or risk ruining their reputation. Maybe they shouldn't have been so greedy with Pixar's contract, & Steve Jobs could've saved them, oh well."
3,It follows the recipe,"The recipe isn't bad. The setting is WWII, the last war that the US could feel good about. The animation is up to par, expressive and with varied characters, good, bad, and in between. The individuals have personalities - not deep, maybe, but distinct in actions, appearance, and voicing. The plot is filled with understandable, iconic images: tough training sargeant, all the different recruits, cute nurse, and so on. And, somehow, John Cleese was sucked into doing one of the voices.It's kid-safe, heroic, and cute-animal stuff. If you're tired of hearing your eight year old ask why that lady took her clothes off, it's a relief. The only problem is that a good kids' movie has stuff in it for the grownups, too. This one addresses the kids, but not the people who bought the movie tickets.//wiredweird"
3,Your toddler will love it!,This movie was ok for adults but my 3 year old son loved it. Will definately buy when it comes out on DVD.
3,Mediocre,"The idea for this movie was actually pretty good: show the World War II experience through the eyes of the homing pigeons that assisted. Ok, could be fun. The execution of this idea does not live up to its original inception. It's not that it's terribly bad, it's just mediocre. There are a large amount of cliches that pop up every few minutes and that gets annoying, as does the seeming necessity to insert flatulence jokes in every kid movie these days. But there are some parts that will make you laugh. But they are too few and far between to really save the entire experience. It just, at times, feels uninspired."
4,Movie Guys Rock,"I had been all over our city looking for this movie and finally gave in to order it on-line through Amazon. It was easy, affordable and the movie arrived well in advance of Christmas. It was easier than running all over town even with my reservations about putting my financial information in cyber space. A very good experience."
4,Excited to Explore!,"I just received the 1986 version of this book from a friend and I've been having a blast searching google maps for how to find these places 20 + years later (housing developments and street improvements have altered the maps significantly for some areas). The maps in the original book are hand drawn and often don't include street names, just basic directions like make the first right after the wash and drive 2.5 miles lol That's my kind of adventure! Now that I've got some gaps filled in I'll be sure to keep this book in the car for the next time the exploration bug hits! I can't wait!I docked it 1 star just cuz the maps are so crude in the original, but computers weren't too common then so ya can't be too hard on the guy ;-)"
5,Arizona book,What a great book. If you ever want to go out in the back country this will get you there
1,FORGET IT!,"I noticed this book as I was browsing for information about menopause. Ipurchased it thinking a good laugh would be a welcome thing! If a gigglewas had, it was solely a result of the adorable drawings. I actually wincedat a few of the comments. A definite DON'T BOTHER!"
3,Some Memorable Stuff,"Not a bad album..As with many of Queen's post 1980 albums, there are a handful of great songs on this album-but others that are mediocre.'I Was Born To Love You ' and the inspirational 'Made In Heaven' -both originally released as part of Freddie Mercury's 1985 solo album ' Mr. Bad Guy'- and Brian May's beautiful 'Too Much Love Will Kill You' are all fantastic.There are a few others I would have left off and replaced with remakes of songs from Queen's 1970's golden era.All in all, there is some memorable stuff here."
3,good but underrated album,"i bought this on amazon for $3.99! good album. i would at least rank it to be as good as innuendo ,a kind of magic and the miracle(if you like those albums like i do). but nowhere as good as the classics, sheer heart attack, news of the world, the game, and even 1984. the most boring tracks are the last two 'bonus' tracks...boring stuff."
4,"Decent, but Innuendo was way better.","I am well aware of the fact that a lot of Queen fans like this album the best. I disagree. First of all, not all of the stuff on here is new and newly recorded. I know that ""My Life Has Been Saved"" and ""Heaven for Everyone"" contain old vocals, NOT vocals that were recorded after Innuendo. My guess is that ""Made In Heaven"" (the song) has vocals that were recorded after Innuendo (Freddie's voice just sounds like that time period). My only complaint is that not all of the songs were ""new,"" but the ones that were are right near there with Innuendo. ""Mother Love"" was the last song Freddie sang for the album, and at the end of the song, it plays clips of the band in concert (my guess is it's clips from Live At Wembley), as if his life is audibly flashing before our very ears. All in all, it is a nice album, just not the best."
2,dynamite without a laserbeam,"dismall performance by the remaining 3 of queen,for me innuendo is the mother of all queen albums released in 1991,this album is trully screwed thanks to pre,queen mummies,apart from the ending iv never heard so much s..t in my entire life,there was so much rec songs by fredd over his lifetime solo@queen,wise but these twats never used them,it just shows without freddie these guys arent worth it anymore,tracks on this album to the h,core fan have been heard years ago to the new fan yes ofcourse buy it but after bin it."
3,A very powerful approximation...,"Queen is my favorite band. I even like (most of) their solo stuff. That being said, would I recommend this album? I would have to say yes--Provided it was not to be the ONLY Queen album bought. It is, after all, mostly a remix album of 3 member's solo stuff. There are new songs, and they are powerful. The remixed/re-recorded ones are strong. In my mind, the only thing keeping this album from a 4 +(?) star rating is that even though Freddie is singing them, QUEEN didn't finish them. No one knows what these tracks could have become, given all four members' input through completion. Sure, it's as close as any other group of people could come, but it is not Queen-- four (often opposing) influences, meshing into one orchestration. It is, instead, a very powerful approximation."
3,Hidden Gems,"I think it's true, that this is not their best work, but there are still some incredible special pieces on this album. I love Let Me Live; could listen to it all day. But the best thing about this album is the 22-minute hidden track at the end. It won't play on your usual CD player. Pop the CD into your computer and use Windows Media Player, and discover an incredible new age type instrumental piece that will blow you away. Yes, it's true it's not in Queen's usual style, but if you like new age stuff at all, this piece stands up there with the best of it. At the very end of the piece, you will hear Freddie's voice saying ""fabulous."" And it is. This album is definitely worth a buy."
3,Freddie Mercury's posthumous release,"As one reviewer noted, this CD seems to be getting the ""sympathy vote"" from many Queen fanatics. While it is not up to the standards of Mercury's final recordings with Queen on ""Innuendo,"" this posthumous release does have its moments. ""It's a Beautiful Day"" is a lovely opener -- very simple and life-affirming. ""Let Me Live"" and ""Mother Love"" are both strong. ""A Winter's Tale"" is another gem, with Freddie's voice adding layers of emotion to a fairly simple lyric. What drags this down a bit is the heavy use of synths, and the re-recording of previously released material. Also, there are no out-and-out rockers here, no attempts to explore different styles (a hallmark of the band). Had Freddie stayed around a while longer, this most certainly have been a stronger, more focused album. Not bad certainly, but it definitely feels half-finished. I would recommend it only for the true Queen fanatic."
5,emotion charged!,what a great album for any music lover.heaven for everyone and let me live are right up there with queens best songs of the seventies and eighties lets remember that despite freddies illness queen were still very much an evolving band and i believe that no two albums sounded the same. this album was a tribute to the whole four members not just freddie.... it brought out their true emotions and you can hear it in the wonderful music this cd has to offer. go get it!
5,A Masterful Recording!,"I'm sorry, but I had to rebuttle ""Scout from Wichata, Kansas"" review, since he didn't leave his E-Mail address. Of course, the person on the ""Made In Heaven"" cover is not Freddy, because it's not even a person. That is a real statue of Freddy erected in Montreaux, Switzerland in his memory. And if anyone ever deserved it, he did. And so what if these are new versions of older songs? Freddy was in his dying days and somehow managed to find the strength to sing these wonderful songs with more feeling than ever! How could he expected to come up with new material in his condition? I was throughly pleased with this album upon first listen, and still am!"
3,"Good, but not great. A lot of rehashed material","As a major Queen fan, I was glad for one last disc. However, many of the songs sound like they took the vocals from Freddie's solo album, ""Mr. Bad Guy,"" and put new backing and slightly different arrangements on them. An unlisted instrumental cut at the end just goes on and on and on, and becomes quite painful."
2,Time was running out...,"When Queen recorded ""Made in heaven"", Freddie Mercury was literally dying, and he wanted to record as many songs as possible before he died. I believe sadness and nostalgic might blur the judgement regarding the value of this album, because it is not worth an average rating of 4.5 stars. That would be obvious when you compare ""Made in heaven"" with ""Sheer heart attack"" or ""News of the world"" just to name a few. Among the finer moments are the very good and emotional ""Mother love"" together with ""Too much love will kill you"" (originally a Brian May solo effort) but the overall impression is that time was running out and the band could not come up with enough good material so therefore, ""Made in heaven"" is an album of too many fillers or mediocre songs. Too bad, but that's the truth according to me!"
3,"Good Intentions, Mediocre Album","Being a Queen fan, I can understand why the band would want to release ""Made In Heaven,"" as a final posthumous tribute to Freddie Mercury.Unfortunately, the album only has a few real gems. The rest are lackluster songs that sound inferior to past works, and they feel rushed. You get the impression that Freddie wanted to sing just about anything before his final curtain (which is true), and as a result the quality of this album suffers a bit.Still, it's a worthy addition to any Queen collection. The emotional overtones however make it something that's hard to listen to all the way through without getting depressed.Personally, I think Freddie should have bowed out after ""The Show Must Go On,"" the final track of ""Innuendo!"""
3,Queen - Posthumus Release,"Although ""Innuendo"" was the last official Queen album, Freddie Mercury continued to record with the band right up until days before his death. In 1995 surviving band members Brian May, John Deacon, and Roger Taylor decided to finish up some these tracks and the release them as the album ""Made In Heaven"". A lot of the material here can be found on either Brian May, Freddie Mercury, or Roger Taylor solo albums, so much of this is not new. I think that nostalgia may paint this album as a bit better than it actually is. There are some good songs here and the music is good for the most part, but it does not flow together nearly as good as the best Queen albums, and had a definite pieced together feel to it. This is a decent enough album for the Queen fan, but like Led Zeppelin's ""Coda"" this was put together after the fact and to some extent it sounds like it."
5,R.I.P. Freddie Mercury,"I came to Queen in MY early 60s, yet I find this final celebration of the vocal magic of Freddie Mercury to be a true crown for the fourteen previous albums. The warmth and poetry are very touching, even before experiencing the twenty-three minute final track, clearly emanating from another dimension."
5,Queen CD received,"I recently received the Queen CD I ordered and am pleased with the condition of the CD, case and insert.I have not had a chance to listen to the CD as yet. I know that I will enjoy the CD tracks as I am aQueen fan and a fan of Freddy Murcury."
5,For all Queen fans and non Queen Fans!,This CD truly brings out some of the best in Queen. It has some of the greatest music they have ever made. This CD has something for everyone; Queen fan or not! God bless Freddie Mercury!
4,Awesome,"I borrowed this CD from my best friend, who is the biggest Queen fan I know. This CD is lush, dreamy, sweet, and POWERFUL. I always want to cry whenever I hear ""Made In Heaven"" because it's such a beautiful song."
4,Very good.,This book is very good. Every Buffy fan should get it. It talks about all of the characters and the people who play them. It has some very good pictures too.
5,Great book for details on Buffy and co. look here.,"This book has it all. From how Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) started out, all the way to Nicholas Brendon's (Xander) twin brother. A great book for anyone who wants to know more about the cast. In other words, a must read."
1,"Like the Special Edition of a DVD, without the special","I bought this book becuase I read Lets Get Real or Lets Not Play by Mahan Khalsa and was very intruiged by it. Lets Get Real is a TERRIFIC book. Little did I know that BusinessThink is basicly the coles notes version of Lets Get Real with two other names plunked above his. There is little additional value added here. If you want to get the same material but more of it and better presented, buy Lets Get Real."
1,"if you need this, your company doesn't need you","The five star reviews seem remarkably, well, of one voice.The vapid generalizations seem fit for people who can afford the luxury of Covey type seminars.One book on activity based accounting, and a book on activity based management, in an open books environment, will do more good than a thousand of these trivial, banal works.One manager looked at anyone who proposed sending the employees to such workshops, and said, ""If you need them, we don't need you.""He was right.People will go to great lengths to avoid thinking responsibly about how the organization really does business; books like this make people feel good - more like a ""motivation"" seminar than real, responsible, personal change.Once again - open book management, activity based accounting, activity based management, and feel good about achieving, or go the Hell home.And take your damn Covey organization books with you."
1,Another Dumb Business Book Destined For The Bargin Bin,"The premise here is that there is only one way to think about business. Hahahah Give me a break!!! Here we have a book that is all about marketing and salesmanship. A catchy title, neat colors on the cover and the blurbs on the back all say buy me. But what is not as cleaver is what is on the inside. It is the same old stuff that one thousand business books have said before. How boring!!! How dumb!! Think about that one will ya."
2,A rehash of a better book,"I guess that the fact that the third author in this book is Mahan Khalsa is because it is a rehash of his materials. These two authors don't seem very creative and most everything covered in the book is Mahan's. Mahan's name is in smaller print in the book than Marcum and Smith when it should have been the other way around.I am surprised that the Franklin Covey corporation has authorized this book.With that said, the book has some good ideas that could be of value although they must not be easy to implement since the authors have not helped their company, Franklin Covey become profitable as reported in a USA Today article."
3,Just Another Business Book,"The authors of businessThink base this book on their eight rules for business success. These rules all are focused on asking the right questions prior to all decision points, ensuring data-based decision making processes. The rules themselves are relatively obvious, though, and very few real-world examples are included. Not the best business book; not the worst. Also, one aspect of the book that is somewhat annoying is that the authors use the phrase ""businessThink"" at least 500 times in the book."
5,The secret is out,"The businessThink philosophy is about geting back to basics in an easy, methodical way. This book provides a foundation of principals that can be applied to many different scenarios (sales, finance, operations). These principals revolve around spending time on the right solution to meet a need...""no guessing""! In addition, checking your ego at the door is so important when trying to sell something...how many times have you said to yourself, ""that guy was an idiot""? Would you buy from them? Probably not. businessThink provides the secrets to a successful sales team and high performing organization...I'm sorry that secret is out! Dave, Steve and Mahan, you just increased my competition! Bravo!"
5,The Rules From Those Who Know!,"Having read ""the 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"", I'm quick to pick up anything with the FranklinCovey seal of approval. So I was extremely pleased to find this gem among the glut of business books available. So many bad business decisions are made with overinflated egos and blind confidence that most products and companies fail. Those of us with open minds can benefit from the rules presented in ""businessThink"", and I have to disagree with the mindset of the reviewer from Tampa. If more executives used these rules and did some serious thinking before taking action, they would more likely end up millionaires than ""philosophers."" The authors here present the ""philosophy"" in an easy-to-read format... but it's up to the reader to put them into ""action""! Highly recommended!"
5,"Finally, a solid model for business decision making!","I'm a business owner who is tired of personal opinions, personal agendas and general guessing when it comes to making crucial business decisions. I'm not sure how to put into words what this book has meant to my rapidly changing business. Now everyone in our company is a decision maker- the only criterion is 1- Check your ego At the door and 2- identify the hard evidence. As we get better at using the model in Business Think we are becoming more and more profitable. We no longer have to spend countless meetings guessing and reguessing to achive the desired result. Thank you for taking the time to business think outside the box!"
3,It's More of a Thick Pamphlet Than a Book,"This book is more of a soft thick pamphlet than a book. It is interesting and raises some good points but isn't the instructional book that I thought I was buying. Overall, it seems like more of a teacher's aid book which is what I believe it was, in fact, intended to be."
3,Color tablets don't give off much color,I was not very impressed with these bath tablets. It took a lot of tablets to change the color of the water. My son has used a lot of different brands of bath tablets and these are definitely on the low end of the ratings chart. These are definitely not worth buying. The tablets from Crayola are definitely looking into and worth buying if you want tablets that dramatically change the color of the water.
5,Always a huge hit with the kiddos at bathtime,All my kids have always loves bath Fizzys. It was a great way to teach them about mixing colors to make new colors. My 6 & 11 year old both still like their colorful bubble baths.
2,Won't buy again.,This product was not at all what I expected. You have to add 4-5 tablets just to get a little bit of color. I have used the crayola tablets before and only had to use one or two to get the color I wanted. I would recommend that instead. Cost more but you get more tablets that are bigger and will give you really bright colors. This product is just really disappointing.
5,One of my favorite soundtracks!,"I enjoyed the movie Powder, and I loved the music. Because it has been discontinued, I paid more than I have most CDs I have purchased. This was worth every penny. The music in hauntingly beautiful. I could listen to this over and over again. This again is one of the CDs I feel fortunate to have in my collection."
3,The Cheek of It!,"*Lickapaw arches her back and swipes at the reviewer. She hisses* How dare you! Powder is a much better film than that! Sure, it can be seen as 2 dimentional, if you want to. If you give it more attention, rather than just half-watching it while you wonder where the hell the M&M's have disappeared to, then you'll see that this film does have at least a certain amount of depth. It would have been a really good film, it just wasn't quite ready to be filmed yet. With the script given a bit more time and effort, and possibly a look over by a woman (who would have a more emotional idea of this film) it would have been terrific. But it wasn't a VERY bad film. Don't let me hear that again!"
1,Goldsmith's All Time Worst Score,"Shoulda just said NO. Sentimental pap blown up to ludicrously Tragic proportions with a musty Big Theme wheezed out in a 19th Century Romantic style that doesn't convince for a second for all the calculated emotionalism. Trite and unreal. Nice attempt to create a real film from this project, but the score just amplifies the problems. Tries to be everything it is not. The simplified Mahleriana approach may appeal to some listeners and public radio programmers."
4,Great repertoire for Beverly Sills,"This is one of my favourite Sills-CDs because THAT is Sills' repertoire. I'm always a bit concerned when Beverly forces highly dramatic parts on her voice. But on this CD she can be heard at her very best. To correct one reviewer: Sills certainly was NOT admired as Carmen, she didn't have the chest-notes and never sang Carmen. She's fantastic in this French repertoire! Brava!"
5,Beverly Sills,"Great CD of a great artist. I met Miss Sills and her husband once, and I was dazzled by her laughter, personality and wicked sense of humor. This CD brought back the memory of her voice at it's peak."
4,I'm so sorry,"I'm sorry if I hurt anyone. I was just so mad and angry because Callas got bashed so many times by a Sills-Fanatic. I deeply apologise. Sills has a very beautiful voice, one of the best lyric coloratura voices out there. I hope Bev's fans will forgive me. This is a lovely recital."
3,As good as it gets,"All of Sills recordings so far make us the new generation who have never heard Beverly Sills in her prime wonder why she was rated as high as Sutherland, Caballe or Callas. I bought this CD to learn about her singing and was very disappointed by it. I could not even get through it at the first time. She sounded so tired to me. All I can hear is her struggling through those high notes. Yes, her French diction is clear but it does not help much here. If you want to hear her better French singing, get her ""Manon"" with Gedda."
2,"Beautiful voice, bad selections",I love her voice. It's kind of sweet and small but full of character. But the selections are boring. I don't recommend this.The sound is uneven.
4,Sills delightful,"Sills' impeccable French makes her singing in that language something worth hearing. Her interpretation is impeccable but for the fact that this recording was taped fairly late in her career and you can sense some strain in her voice. Still, it is an experience to share."
3,Voice too thin,"Sill's technique, especially in the Mozart is fabulous. But the high notes and voice in general is extremely shrill and thin. Without a microphone, she would hardly be heard. I know, I heard her live in 1972. I thought she was the greatest and was disappointed at the smallness of her voice. Only half of it is tone, the other half is air and edginess.But she was a very kind lady, and signed my autograph with a smile. But that's not the reason to consider her the greatest singer of the century as some of her fans think.To be the greatest singer in the world, one must have a great instrument, a great technique, and theatrical presence. I need not say who has all of the above."
4,Excellent reference albeit weak in derivations,"My professor gave me his copy of this book to use for designing some widebance impedance matching networks. Needless to say, as a general reference, this book surpasses most all I've referenced for my work. The only quip I have with the book is that Abrie often skips numerous steps in his derivation, often without placeholders like ""it follows that."" This may, of course, be my limited background talking, but I've had to read over a lot of the stuff and do the math on my own (where, in fact, it isn't actually CLEAR) to figure out what he's saying.And as other reviewers have noticed, it tends to get a little dense and hard to absorb at times; I, too, have found myself rereading a few sections to solidify the material.Overall, though, it's an excellent reference tool and I recommend anyone in the field to have a copy on hand."
3,"The movie is ""stiff"" but plays for the message.","I suspect that most viewers who purchase this movie will understand that it is a low budget Christian film and will overlook the stiff acting. If you are a surfer, do not expect this to be a surfing movie. It's not. Indeed, the stereotypes and lingo are pretty much overplayed, and most surfers (Christian or not) will roll their eyes.This is a Christian message movie and speaks directly to young adults who do not know Jesus. It also speaks to reinvesting in family. It is moderately successful in these areas. I believe that Skipstone Productions will get better as they go, just as the church back in Georgia who produced ""Fireproof"" did. But this remains an early effort."
5,A good reference and a pleasure to read.,"I have been trying for years to find the title of a movie that I saw on television back in the sixties. All I could remember was that it had a one word title. I bought this book on Amazon a couple of weeks ago and there it was on page 273: ""Inferno""!The neat thing I discovered was how much fun it was to page through the book, rediscovering old movies that I had seen and discovering others that I missed. If you are like me and spent a significant part of your childhood watching old movies on tv you will enjoy this book. It not only makes a good reference book but is a pleasure to browse through. This book should be in the reference section of every library that can afford it.(Now, if I could only find a copy of the movie I would be all set!)."
1,Hillsong Kids DVD,"I never got my order of this video, so I'm going to tell others that this place is not all that reliable. Maybe other websites would have better business about making sure their orders actually get to the customers. So I basically paid to recieve nothing. And there's no way of tracking the dvd I ordered so that was money lost on my part. I guess I know better now, not to order from here."
3,Good Music,Overall a really good cd. Have a few really great songs that even adults can grab on to. A few songs are kind of out there though.
5,Great for Kids' Camp!,I have the awesome privelege of leading music at kids' camp. I was looking for some new music to use this year and stumbled upon the CD. What a great find! We used 4 of the songs in our worship segments and the kids loved them! I had as much fun as they did with the music. Maybe even more.
2,just good,A good subject in a very bad book. The photos is very rare and it isn.nt have any color profiles. I hope to reprint this book in a more better quality. It isnt tell very much about the russian volunteers but only for the cossacks.
3,too musky,"This perfume is ok but I was expecting it to smell more feminine or more lavender. It actually has a very strong musky/cologne odor. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, it is unisex and in my opinion, it smells more masculine than feminine. Think twice about buying if you're not into heavy musky perfume, ladies.From the Woods of Windsor website: ""Lavender flower [has] been combined with notes of patchouli, musk and chamomile..."""
2,Be great if there were no caterwalling in the background,"I would have loved this except the music --caterwalling I'd call it--in the background kept me from concentrating. It made it very hard to meditate--I'm just a beginner. Everytime I started to get into it, the wailing in the bacground would get louder and knock me back to earth. Ended up feeling annoyed and frustrated instead of calm and good.."
2,The caterwalling is annoying....,"I agree with another reviewer that the ""caterwalling"" during the Rodney Yee portion of the DVD is hugely annoying and distracting. It's not calming or meditative, but grating.The second portion with Maritza is better with more silence and calming music. I enjoyed this section of the DVD but am so dissapointed with with other one!"
2,after some meditation...,"I'm a Rodney fan from his AM yoga, but I was disappointed in this program. Bored, actually. Which may be more of a reflection on my ability to meditate than his ability to teach it."
3,Meditation,This product is OK. I was not greatly impressed with the format. I'm trying to learn new ways to relax.
4,Love song hits from the 90s,"This album has two of the best love songs from the 90s. They are track 3 ""I'll Never Stop Loving You"" and track 10 ""It Should've Been Me."" Listened to them all the time as a teenager. At these used prices, I'd say try it out."
1,book was in good shape,The book arrived in good shape but the content was retarded....its all lies and trickery and I hated it never finished it
2,Works ok,"I own this shaver and I am not too impressed with it. I bought it at the drug store and although it cuts the hair, it still makes my legs feel like I have stubble and havent shaved in a day or so. I miss having a close shave, this does not deliever it. I am currently looking for something better for the summer time."
2,Leaves stubble -- ineffective,"I picked up this product at a local drug store figuring I would give it a try. I was very disappointed in the results. I tried shaving both dry and wet, and both left my legs with a stubbly feeling. I would not recommend this product to others."
3,ROUGH & A LITTLE PAINFUL,"The size and weight of this shaver is perfect. It does hurt a little bit when using it but the pain doesn't last long. I wish it had come with a brush to clean the inside of blades, etc."
1,worst razor ever,I paid $10 thinking this would be a good way to save on buying replacement blades for the schick razor I have - Wrong. I used it on my underarms and it barely removed any hair. I'm not very hairy so I don't know why it couldn't do the job. I don't have to shave my legs so if it is only good for that then it's no good to me.
2,Not so great....,"I had purchased this item for only 8.99, so I wasn't really expecting it to work all that well. It cuts but still leaves my legs feeling stubbly."
1,Broken and defective...worthless purchase,"Got the package when it came in the mail, it came pretty quickly but that's all I can say about the pros of this product. I ordered the Clio shaver thinking that it would be a great alternative to manual razor shaving, and it WOULD HAVE been, but instead as I inserted the batteries and pressed the ON button, it did not work to my dismay. I even checked multiple times to make sure I followed the directions, and to no avail it still didn't turn on.The only thing that happened was that the batteries began to overheat from being left inside the shaver for some strange reason.I only wish that I didn't get a defective shaver in the first place, otherwise I would have been happy with my purchase..."
3,bits seem fine - hinges are junk,"just got this set - the case arrived with broken hinges, however I am keeping it because the price was right for the bits. The case was a good idea - the hinges shouldn't be plastic."
1,Great idea poor quality!,I bought this and when I got it the hindges on the case was broken. So I asked for another one and that too came to me broken. Then I was told they all are like that so I was refunded the money. too bad.
3,It's a shame,It's a real shame. This cook book has the potential to be a great book but where are the pictures? How are you supposed to know what your dish is meant to look like.
4,easy to read and varied selections,This was a gift for a friend and arrived very quickly. The recipes were quite varied and easy to read.
4,Great help for the novice in this cuisine !,Good recipes and great food ! Recently many medical studies have revealed that eating mediterranean cuisine has a direct correlation on improving health.I would recommend this book for anyone that is interested in health and good taste....
1,A pile of garbage by an Israeli traitor,"Shlomo Ben Ami is one of the left wing Israeli traitors who try to change history. This book is full of lies, illusions, and pure hate. It is hard to understand the minds of such cowards, when anybody can study the internet and know everything about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. My guess is that most readers don't bother to look at the historical facts and cowards like Ben Ami count on that. But, what motivates a miserable self hating Jew like Ben Ami to spread lies? Probably the money he gets from selling a controvercial book. Like his buddy Jimmy Carter, another lier, who has received millions from Saudi Arabia and has kissed the asses of all the dictators in the world. Shlomo Ben Ami, and his left wing bunch of cowards should be prosecuted for being traitors."
3,good reference book,"I do like the photographs, the history, and descriptions. A good reference for aircraft when I need a picture to go along with prose. I found the guide difficult because the aircraft were organized by manufacturer. An index by name of the aircraft would have been helpful."
1,totally worthless,"i was hoping for some enlightenment on seeing Scotland by rail; this dvd is worthless in every aspect. i honestly cannot see ANY merit to this rubbish but responsible recycling! Amazon.com, protect your reputation and remove this title from of your inventory..."
2,Pease make clear,the genre of book. If it is I/R BM/WW PLEASE say so and not use black women on cover. Very misleading. I have problems when black men are made to look bad in I/R stories and the white man is perfect. Not going to be thrilled when the reverse happens. Was not happy and won't be reading this author again.
4,Awesome!!!,"This is a great CD. If you miss Weezer (like I do) then you will love this CD. It is fast and fun to the very end. I should also mention that it contains the song ""I Don't Care"" from one of the greatest movies of all time- Chasing Amy."
4,DONIZETTI AND THE REST,"As DEPUIS LE JOUR demonstrates,COTUBRAS was perhaps the best incarnation of LOUISE in our time.In this cd of highlights ,the singer displays her talent with arias from MOZART,VERDI,PUCCINI and a good part of the cd is devoted to DONIZETTI's L'ÃLISIR D'AMOUR.Most of these arias are well known to opera lovers,because they have been showcase for many sopranos singers over the years.I think that such a cd is a good start for those who want to listen to arias without buying complete operas.A complete recording of an opera is always hard to digest for non initiÃ©s.This usually comes a little later,when you have experience that kind of music live.ILEANA COTRUBAS has played many famous hÃ©roines on the stage"
1,Incorrect Edition: Beware,"According to the reviews by the editors, as well as customers, this was supposed to be an updated edition by Slominsky. However, I received a reprint of the 1900 first edition. It was extremely out of date and not at all what I expected to receive. It even used old print plating and was difficult to see the words clearly. Buyer should be sure to confirm the edition of this book. I am very disappointed."
1,The is NOT the Latest Edition,"If you order this item, what you will receive is a reprint of the 1900 edition, written when Nicholas Slonimsky was six-years old. The product description is entirely misleading, and Slonimsky had nothing to do with this book."
2,Better than the first but still trash.,"this series could have been interesting. But they just do not live up to expectation. The characters are so boring that it is mind numbing.The plot jumps around which is fine, but fails to really make any sense. Much of what happens is predictable and lacking. the series has many military mistakes which is unforgivable. Read what he used to do as a profession.I thought i'd give the second one a go. but it really is just not a good series. Read Larry bond or tom Clancy for good stories in the techno thriller genre."
2,Completely unrealistic story about WWIII,The second book in the WWIII series is a disappointment. Not only are there many miliatary inaccuracies but the whole plot is unrealistic. He says that there were thousands of T-90's with thousands of artillery guns ready to Crush the small NATO pocket. And general Freeman(Superman) comes along and leads the counter attack with 1/10 of the number of equipment as the russians and eventually reaches Moscow! Gimmie a break Ian! Your first book was much better. Try working on the realism.
5,Great Music!,Unstrung HeroesA wonderful film about a boy who finds his identity while learning to live with and love his eccentric extended family. A great story; a fine move; and wonderful music. This DVD has it all!
3,The Nightfighters,"""Nightfighters""The movie, ""Nightfighters,"" is about the Army pilots, at the Tuskegee Army Base, in Alabama, during World War II. It tells about the war and how the African American soldiers were treated. They interviewed some of the soldiers that fought in the war, such as Spann Watson and Herbert E. Carter. They talked about the segregation on the Army bases and how the African American soldiers offered their hospitality when the other soldiers needed it. They gave the other soldiers a shelter when their planes could not get to their own base, because it was covered with snow.It was really nice of the African American soldiers to help the other soldiers out, even though they were segregated from the white Americans, because of their race. It was not fair that they had to be apart from the other soldiers. The war explained how the differences in race can bring out the worst in people."
3,The First African American Pilot,"Danielle ChristensenThe movie, Nightfighters is about the struggle and hardships of the Tuskegee airmen. Their unit was located in Tuskegee, Alabama, where they learned more than anyone could imagine about airplanes. This small unit was for Blacks and run by them. Charles Alfred Anderson was one of the best flyers that could have flown. He taught the men how to fly, as he taught himself to fly. I thought the movie was a little too factual, but I learned a lot about the Tuskegee Airmen. In the end, the men learned a great lesson about airplanes as well as about life."
3,The Tuskegee Airmen,"The Tuskegee airmen were the best protectors of the bomber planes, during WWII. They tried their hardest to get the bombers to and from their targets safely. The Tuskegee airmen were always segregated and they never integrated with the other white pilots. All of their flight instructors were waiting for them to fail and some did, but their determination didn't let them quit. They did the extra work, they did the extra practice, they took the extra garbage from all of their instructors. They came through, and became the best fighters/flyers/protectors from the USA. ..."
4,Pleasant overview,"I am not a musical expert, but I enjoy listening to this collection. Some tracks seem redundant, but other tracks are just brilliant."
1,Art of Segovia-2 CD pack,"Art of SegoviaI purchased the CD's in May of 2011. The quality of the recording was very poor--it was impossible to hear the music in any satisfactory way. The 2CD's would ""jam"" and repeat a phrase over and over and over in multiple locations.Amazon Verified Purchase"
4,Inspirador,"Es muy motivador e inspirador para quienes estamos interesados en la guitarra clasica, buena calidad de grabacion y buena seleccion de temas. Feliz con mi adquisicion"
3,"Good music, terrible recording quaility","I would rate the actual music as five stars and the recording quality as only one star. There is so much hiss and buzzing, that some of the quieter parts of the songs are actually drowned out by the loud hiss and buzzing. It is so distracting for me. I love the music, but I wish that I had not bought this CD. I know that the technology when it was recorded was not the same as today's standards, but I cant believe that the recording is so bad... and its on every song, although some are worse than others. I even put in another CD to make sure that it was not something wrong with my audio system. Its too bad because the guitar playing is beautiful."
4,Excellent way of letting students know what life is really like in other countries...,"I have this video and the one on China and they are both very informative. Students like to hear what life is like from other students and this was great. WARNING: There is a mother breastfeeding in the video. Otherwise it focuses on the lives of a boy who lives in the country side and a young girl (wealthier) who lives in the suburbs of Cairo, plays tennis, and is learning three languages."
2,Why the Amerivan voices?,"Families of Egypt (Families of the World)This is an educational DVD obviously for American school children which presents the contrasting lives of the rural and urban dwelling Egyptian families. However, I was extremely annoyed to hear the strong American accents in the voice overs of the Egyptian children featured in the DVD. Whilst the narrative was informative and the lives of both families authentic, the children's accents were irritating and spoilt the impact of the DVD for me."
5,Great!!!!,A wonderful story in this wonderful series. I wish there were more books. The last one was DEAD END. =(
3,"Troubleshooting, Maintaining, & Repairing PCs",It is a very informative and handy book to have when your pc needs repair.
5,Working Class Hero,This is a totally awesome piece of work. The various artists are faithful to the orginal without totally recreating John's work. Worth a listen or twenty!
3,Fine tribute to Lennon as Rebel,Good selection of songs from John Lennon's albums that reflect his personal and political journey. Most versions of his songs are very good. Not wild about the version of Cold Turkey -- way too laid back. Most love songs included are pretty good; a few are forgettable. All in all this is one of the best tribute albums I've ever purchased.
4,modern rock with the intense lyrics of a musical GOD,"Perhaps those of you who reviewed this CD before didn't notice, but the listing of bands on the CD label are, for the most part, rock artists. They united in tribute to John Lennon with personal interpretations of the original masterpieces. If you want the original, buy the original. If you want incredible covers of some truly challenging songs, then purchase this album. In addition, I don't see how ANYONE could claim that the Screaming Trees' version of 'Working Class Hero' doesn't do justice to the original..."
1,One of the worst things I've ever heard,"I love the originals, and some of the groups doing the covers, but this has to be one of the worst messes I've ever heard.The covers are lifeless and dull, and even The Flaming Lips, who I thought could do no wrong, do a horrible cover.Get the originals, forget these covers."
2,No good!,"Cute colors, and i really like the smaller avent pacifers, but these are too heavy and fall out his mouth when he is almost asleep and wake him up. I also have Mam pacifers and I'll buy those from now on. Dont waste your money. I do like the cover that comes with avent pacifers though."
3,Have heard better!,Great movie but the soundtrack is just okay and I have heard better music from Alan Silvestri!
3,It's Okay but didn't totally interest me!,"Well I really liked the movie Father Of The Bride II but I don't totally enjoy the soundtrack, I like the songs Give Me The Simple Life, The Way You Look Tonight, At Last, When The Saints Go Marching In, and On The Sunny Side Of The Street, but the instrumental music though good just didn't interest me. Now I do love instrumental music, I have heard music by Alan Silvestri that I have really liked and I love Classical music which is my favorite types of music and I like, Opera, Windham Hill, etc, but I just didn't happen to care for some of the instrumental music on this soundtrack and wish there were more songs like Give Me the Simple Life, etc."
5,beautiful arrangements,I watched the movie several times and loved it.My daughter walked down the aisle to one of the arrangements and she took the CD with her when she moved out!I was glad to be able to find it thru Amazon.
1,Camera doesn't fit,Olympus C765 camera doesn't fit well in the bag. It is cheap and not worth the money.
1,Camera doesn't seat well in bag,Not that happy with the product. Designated camera doesn't seat well in the bag and the top doesn't close well. Choose something else. I guess there is always a reason for bargain prices.
3,Best for English-accents,"I'm finding that the pronunciations in this book are often meant for people who speak English with an English accent, since the book is from the UK. Also, the book and the tapes don't always go in the same order."
4,Small investment. Big payoff.,"I recently bought this book in anticipation of attending a close friend's wedding in Norway. It is a great course - with a good mix of grammar, vocabulary, cultural notes, and pronunciation help (using the tapes). The course proceeds rather quickly and covers more ground than similar language courses. And surprisingly, the course does not ""feel"" dense.Overall, this is a great buy. Nonetheless, I gave it only four stars because of the formatting. The book contains lots of little sections. You'll see an average of two to three quick exercises/dialogs/explanations/vocabulary-keys per page. It's all great information, but it bumps around rather quickly. It is a personal preference of mine to have a slightly slower pace."
1,TURN AWAY FROM THIS,FRANCO NERO IS AN ALL TIME FAVOURITE OF MINE BUT WHY HE MADE THIS IS BEYOND ME APART FROM A BEAUTIFULL LEADING LADY THIS MESS WITH ITS INANE SCRIPT AND BUSTING ITS ARSE TRING TO BE FUNNY WELL ITS NOT AND MY POCKET AINT LAUGHING EITHER wILLIAN (AL )WATTS RADIO PRESENTER AUSTRALIA
2,nice features but cheap material,"It works but i'm a little embarassed to show it off because it looks cheap, feels cheap, and cheap....cheap cheap..."
5,Grabbed Your Attention and KEPT IT!,"Stephen Ford may not be a well known author but Mortality was still pretty darn good. After reading several average books this month, it was a relief to read a book that actually grabbed a readers attention. The plot was different also with the ""villain"" in this case experimenting on others (who wanted to look younger) and his nephew who did not give consent so the villain could possibly find a cure for his son dying of Progeria (aging disease) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProgeriaThe side affects of the drug are brain tumors which cause people to act violently against themselves and/or others. Bad guys, even if doing it for good reasons, usually don't fare well in books and in the end, neither did this bad guy."
4,You'll suspend your disbelief,"This is a supremely entertaining book with engaging characters and a superb plot, especially if you're interested in speculative applications of medical research particularly with respect to anti-ageing and quality of life issues. The core theme of the book concerns the personal and professional redemption of an alcoholic ex-cosmetic surgeon, who was betrayed by his ex-brother-in-law medical colleague and as a result lost his license to practice, who is offered a new life by that same brother-in-law at an anti-ageing ""age reversal"" clinic in the Florida Keys. It is an extremely interesting book with enough grounding in research reality to convince the reader to suspend disbelief concerning the suggested therapies."
4,jig and fixture design,The book is very useful to the undergraduate students as well as practising engineers.
3,"Future Sounds of Jazz, Vol. 8",By far I liked Atjazz's Wrong Type of Day the best. Also very good were Spaceman and Spiritual Rotations.The rest of the CD cuts were largely forgetable.
4,Makes you think,"Aloha, I had borrowed the book from a friend and was so inspired by it , I ordered my own copy."
5,Awsome book,"This book is amazing, everyone one should read it, it should sit next to your bible. Its basically about an athiest who dies and goes to hell, then Jesus literally saves him and answers a heap of questions I think the whole world would love to know. It explains what God really is, why the world is the way it is, what hell is, what heaven is, even that there are other worlds out there is the universe! and that the most important thing ever is love for eachother. Kinda like ""the bible for dummies"" from first-hand experience. The world and God's word makes alot more sense after reading this book. And for people who don't beleive this guys's for real, why would anyone make this up? Sincerly one of the best books I've ever read :)"
4,Interesting Book & Story,"I am a Christian and I read this book to see what it was all about. I am unsure if I believe in NDE's as far as being truly dead but it is an interesting story for you to decide on your own what you think. I truly believe that Howard Storm feels he was in heaven but the book is a little different when Howard is asking Jesus questions and Jesus answers them one by one. Not sure how I felt about this part in the book. Oh well, it's an interesting book but as always I would go back to the Bible and study it to see its truths."
2,Uneasy View of Heaven,"The book is entertaining and frightening in places, but it's quite a bit different from other NDEs. In Storm's account, God is not a personal being, but a nebulous light with lesser lights fluttering around above. There're no streets, roads, buildings or ancestors. Angels don't have human forms and I'm troubled that Storm's experience is so vividly different than those of others. Storm obviously experienced a life-changing event, but I'm troubled by his insistence that there will be no more world wars (there will be), nuclear detonations (there will be) and that man will become better until 200 years from now, man will reach a near perfect state. I enjoyedI Stand All Amazed: Love and Healing from Higher Realmsmuch more and recommend that. Also Lance Richardson'sThe Message."
5,My Descent into Death. A Second Chance at Life.,Wonderful! This book just validated all that I have read in the Bible about life after death. Howard Storm's account was a real account of the after life.
5,I devoured this book,I've read a lot of near death/after life books and this was one of the better ones. I read it in one sitting.
4,A second chance,"I have heard this person on a radio talk show some time back, and wanted to read the things he had left out, Some of us just want to know about the near death , its amazing that a person goes from not belive to a minister of faith,"
2,"Would not buy, get from library if you must! 148 hard pages.",This book was a hard read. It has good parts but this story would better suit a book with many different life after death accounts. I feel this story is filled with filler. Small 148 page book. Just get it from the library like I did. Not something to purchase. I do appreciate the story well the part about Storms after death experience.
1,"Don't be mislead, this is false private revelation","This book is full of false private revelation. It is full of New Age philosophies, light beings, spiritual guides, reincarnation, and for those of you who are Catholic, it goes against the teachings of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, etc.For those of you who are Catholic: I cannot imagine Jesus saying ""The best religion is the religion that brings you closest to God."" That is total nonsense! Jesus is the Bread of Life. The Catholic Church is the one true Church, how much sense does it make then for Jesus to say the best religion is the religion that brings you closest to God? Jesus would want Howard to join the Catholic church to receive the fullness of faith.This reeks of fallen angels.....To learn more about false private revelations, go to the website called catholicplanet and click on the link to learn the difference between false and true private revelations."
5,Captivating.....,"If your'e wondering if its worth the $$$ to purchase this book, please stop wondering, its AMAZING.Storm narrates in a personal fashion that captures the readers interest right away. He uses simple language, easy to understand wording and all that he says will leave you captivated, sitting in your chair with half your coffee going cold because you have forgotten all about it! ( Yep, thats what happened to me!)I bought this book with no prior knowlege of Storm's other work but because I had lost someone close to me. I can now smile instead of wonder when I think of him.Thank you Howard."
2,An Uneven Descent,"The book club at my church (Episcopalian) designated Descent as its November 2005 selection. In sum, we liked the first part, but about two-thirds of the way through, the narrative crumbled.Everyone enjoyed the riveting story of his life-threatening situation in Paris, and the ordeal of his recovery. And we liked most of the parts when he's talking with the angels. But when the author stops telling his story and starts preaching, then people put the book down.Also, someone complained that he ties up all of the loose ends of his life before the ordeal, except for one, and that caused her to not to give the book any sort of recommendation. The first half and the second half are barely cohesive, and, as a result, we all felt that his editor failed in his or her responsibilities to the book."
1,What a Bunch of Crap,"Parts of Mr. Storm's story don't hold up from the very beginning. Are we really supposed to believe that in ""a large public hospital"" in Paris in 1985 he had to be transported on a gurney ""for several blocks"" on the sidewalk outdoors in order to get from the emergency room to his hospital room? And that because it was the weekend there were no surgeons available in the entire city to perform the operation he needed? And that the diagnosis and severity of his condition wasn't communicated from the emergency room doctors to other hospital personnel? And that when hospital personnel didn't seem to understand the emergency nature of the situation it didn't occur to his wife or to the English-speaking patient in the next bed or to that patient's wife to contact the doctor who made the original diagnosis or the emergency room doctors and ask them to intervene? Please."
1,My Decent into Death: A Second Chance at Life,Excellent book! I have given it to several friends who found it very inspiring. An amazing story about a person's spiritual transformation.
5,Life Changing,A friend suggested the book and loaned hers to me. My husband and I drove 11 hours to the beach and on the way home I thought I would read a few chapters but I read the whole book. It reaffirmed what I already believed but needed to hear it from firsthand experience. Awesome.
3,Do Make Say Think,"Punted this one and it's pretty good.The reviews below give you a fair idea, so I'd just like to add that those who are fascinated by the closing track might like to go back 25 years before this, to 'He Loved Him Madly' from Miles Davis' 1974 album ""Get Up With It"".It's great to see so many musicians and music-lovers with such big ears these days."
3,OK,"A friend and had heard of these guys through a friend, and decided to see what it was all about. We both pretended to really like it, but we both knew it was average. When you have stuff like Explosions in the Sky and Mogwai, it is hard to fit something like this into your CD player. If you are a big Post-Rock fan, why not explore a little bit, but this one for me goes by the radar with a very small blip...blip...blip...."
5,To understand our times,"The digital age is very complex. We use machines of all kind and we see how science changes our lives. Everything happens so fast. It is exciting and scary. What we do not know is why all this is taking place. And here comes this book, a heavy volume, totally dedicated to suggesting the reasons for the change we are experiencing. This author is familiar with technology as he is familiar with the many fields analyzed in the book. I am not surprized that Umberto Eco is enthusiastic about this book. At first I read it on the Internet but after that I decided that I have to have this book."
1,Meh,"I bought this for the song that Mad Season did, I Don't Wanna Be A Soldier. I was not impressed by the rest and quickly gave it away."
5,X-tra lead-,"Purchased this one to replace the one that was misplaced. This is for the garage,so when needed we do not have to walk all the way up to the house. Used retractable leads forever. They are much better than a standard type. Highly recommend them. (and dog does, too)"
5,A New Leash on Life!,Great product that does exactly what it claims! Strong and comfortable - the recoil mechanism works flawlessly. The extra long lead (26')lets our dog feel free and we all enjoy our hikes more.
5,Awesome product!,"I was concerned that all I could get in the large size was the tape leash. But the ribbon style works better than my old cord style leash. Still, I can't complain about that, because that Flexi Leash has lasted over 15 years! Using it with my second 75lb German Sheppard. Had to buy another for the new pup! Love it"
2,Didn't make it more than 5 months ...,"When I first got this leash it seemed fine, I got it for my now 90lb German Shepherd puppy. After about 5 months of using the leash, it stopped retracting. I have other brand leashes for my other dogs that I've had for years with no problem. I won't be buying one of these again."
5,My Yorkie loves it as much as I do!,"I have a little 10 lb Yorkie. On walks it is always stop and go, stop and go. She likes to run ahead and then stop, which is really quite annoying if you don't have a retractable leash! And don't get me started on trying to run with her too! Geez, so this is just the most perfect leash! Makes my life and my dogs life so much easier. She can run ahead (23 feet still isn't enough for her sometimes but it has to do) and smell things etc, as I continue to walk to catch up, and then continue to pass her and usually just by the time I am almost 20 feet away she is done and she runs to catch up. And the cycle repeats. End result? She gets to stop and go and I get to have a smooth walk/run. The leash takes some getting used to and the switch at the top holds the leash at one length if you flip it up. I don't think I read the instructions so it took us a while to notice that!"
5,Best Retractable Leash,"Long, sturdy, the flexi-cord is always taut. I've owned two other retractable leashes and this one wins in all categories. The cord also retracts completely back to the holder. Some retractable leashes don't do that, making for that awkward grasp on your dog when you want him right next to you."
3,Overpriced,Great product but very overpriced on line. I found this much cheaper at Walmart. Overall though the leash works great and is very durable.
1,Broke within a month.,"I had a retractable leash from PetSmart that lasted a a few years before the retractable portion started to falter, so based on reviews, I thought this would be the perfect replacement. It worked great for the a month, then yesterday, as I was turning a corner, the cord caught on a post. It momentarily stopped my dog until I could unhook the cord from the post. The cord was fine, no cuts or abrasions at all, but the sudden stop must have knocked the cord off whatever mechanism's inside. Now it's very slow to recoil or stops recoiling completely. I have a 22 pound Pug that is well within the listed 26-pound limit, and the sudden ""stop"" wasn't so hard that it should break anything.So, I called Customer Service. The receptionist politely informed me that all leashes come with a one-year warranty and gave me the return address.Overall, I'm pretty disappointed. I will have to buy another leash while waiting for my replacement. Once it comes in, I'll update this review."
4,Great for long walks and spacious areas,"This is awesome for a walk in the park. If your dog is running too far away from you, you can press the brake button and the leash stops running even though it has the capacity to run up to 23 feet. It gives you control while your dog is free to walk further than your average annoying small leash. Just make sure you snap it correctly onto your dog's harness or collar. If you don't, the leash could snap back at you and injure you. Check the safety instructions, and you will be fine. I recommend it. :)"
2,My dog chewed right through the leash!,"I've only owned this retractable leash for only 2 months, and my dog has already chewed through it! He's not a heavy chewer so I'm surprised. Today, he chewed it off completely while I wasn't looking, and he ended up running through the entire neighborhood. I chased him down and finally caught him after 10 minutes. I expected the leash to be more durable, but I guess I was wrong..."
5,"Fast shipping, great price, terrific product","The leash arrived quickly, and was much less expensive than the usual pet stores. Flexi's are the only leash we use for any of our five large dogs, they are terrific. Thanks!"
4,Third replacement for an excellent product,We just bought our third Flexi Leash for our Labrador Retriever. She exercised them from full extension forward to full extension back for around 45 minutes every day for the past 5+ years. They don't last forever. The spring broke in each of the previous ones. I guess 2.5 years is not bad for tightly wound spring steel. The truth is that I am hooked on the ability to let her do her thing on our walks without actually having her be off-leash.
4,Takes practice,I like the leash but it takes a little practice at first. The dog seems to like it better than the traditional web leash due to its light weight.
2,broke after only a month,"We liked the leash at first, but it broke after not much more than a month's worth of use. I would not trust it and it is too expensive to buy one every month. The dog was not chewing on it either!"
1,be cautious,"The item pictured was not sent. After four or more contacts with customer service I finally gave up.The standard response was ""I'll have to call you back"", and did they? NO!"
1,Terrible!,"I was very excited to buy this leash because my dog is constantly pulling on other leashes and I figured if I was able to give him a little more leave it would resolve the problem and it did until 3 days after it snapped and broke! The leash was only about half retracted and my dog was not even giving me resistance, we were just casually walking and the leash snapped. I have a golden retriever who weighs 86lbs, the leash says it can hold up to 110lbs! Needless to say I was so agitated! I haven't tried to contact the company. I figured that's what you get for $20. Lesson learned!"
1,breaks within months,"My puggle, who weighs all of 15 pounds, took off today and the flexi took off after him. my puggle has been with me less than four months and i got this due to the reviews. it stopped retracting about two months ago, and totally broke today. it will not retract and just dangles, tangling him all up. i'm a very unhappy camper with a dog who needs to go out, badly :("
4,Josie's Leash,"So far, so good. My dog goes through leashes like crazy. The one is compact and very quiet. Time will tell. I would recommmend this leash."
1,Do not buy this leash,"I first purchased this leash in April 2009. 40 days later, the retractable leash stopped retracting. Hoping it was a fluke, I exchanged the product for the same model. 25 days later, the replacement retractable leash has also stopped retracting! I know not every product is perfect, but how can a company manufacture retractable leashes when the 'classic' model doesn't continue retracting for more than 2 months! I have just returned from the local store where I exchanged this leash for a Top Paw. I'm done with Flexi."
1,Not very good,"I purchased this leash in January for my dog weighing maybe 60 pounds. If snapped this past weekend. The leash just broke. The dog ran and it took a while to gather him back. I was quite disappointed in the leash seeing that I had only had it for about 2 1/2 months. I would not buy another one Flexi Large Retractable 26-Foot Classic Long 3 Tape Leash, Black"
1,ONE month and ONE DAY and it is broken,"It lasted until today (one month and one day) after I bought it, then broke. Don't buy it. Used with a Golden Retriever."
4,only for well-trained large dogs,"Despite warnings on the packaging, my wife landed on the ground and broke her collarbone when our big lab ran to the end of the leash and pulled her down. Product did not fail in any way but user error is a concern."
5,"Works great, very sturdy","Cord style works better for me and my dog than the flat tape style. The roller inside extends and retracts easily, smoothly. No fraying issues (yet! All things eventually come to an end, as I expect after long useage this will too). It is very sturdy, high quality, I feel this will probably last me at least a year, possibly longer. I would recommend this product highly over others I have tried/seen."
5,Duke's Lead,"The Flexi large retractable red leash is perfect for our needs. We have a beautiful 3.5 old boxer. He loves to ride and is up for going anywhere. We checked different stores, brick and mortar as well as other webistes for the leash. Everywhere we checked, the price was $40.00. We purchased it at Amazon for $26.00! What a savings for us. Thank you, Amazon!"
2,Got sent the 16ft leash instead of the 23ft one I ordered!,"I ordered the 23 ft long medium black leash. I really enjoyed the product (which is why I gave it 2 stars). However, I was walking my sister's dog and she has a regular 16 ft Flexi leash and I realized that my dog also had the regular 16 ft leash. I ordered the 23 ft leash, and I thought that's what I had gotten. I didn't even realize until a couple of months later that Amazon had sent me a shorter Flexi leash than what I ordered. Now it's too late to return. I'm pretty disappointed because I paid the extra money for the longer leash and I'm stuck with the shorter 16 foot one. Not great customer service at all."
2,"after reading the fine print on the package, I returned it","I have seen other people use these kinds of leashes around town and in my own neighborhood. I ordered it, thinking it would give my dog more freedom to run a bit while we were on walks. When I received the item, I read the instructions and warnings on the package prior to opening it. The warnings talked about severed limbs, strangulation, and other bad things.Then I got to thinking that if we were on a street corner, and if I didn't have the leash in ""lock"" mode, and if my dog decided to run for something just as a car went by, then he could be run down by a car while on a leash!No thanks. I don't want to have to think about severed limbs, strangulation, or ""do I have the leash locked at the proper times"". I just want to walk my dog in peace. And he just wants to have fun, smelling stuff and peeing on stuff. So, I returned the item to Amazon unopened. Thankfully, Amazon is really good about returns."
1,Not What I Ordered,Not the item I ordered. Substitute is acceptable but I would not have ordered this if I had known I was going to get the substitute. Not worth the hassle to try to return it and get my money back.
5,Can't beat the quality or Pirce!!!!,"I absolutely love this leash. I owned one of these before & it lasted 3 years. The one I have now is much more durable then the last one I bought. It is larger & longer. This leash will probably be the last leash I ever have to buy my dog. She is a black lab & is 8 years old. I believe she won't ever need another one. Plus I it gives her so much room to go go anywhere. It is almost like she is off the leash. She gets to move around & gives me a lot of control over her. I also use it on my other little dogs. Once you feel the weight of the leash. You can feel how strong it is & I love how the leash retracts so fasts & the locking mechanism. I can't see how anyone has anything bad to say about this leash. The 5 stars is well deserved & I would have given it more, if possible."
5,Strong Enough to walk a Pony,"I have had retractable leashes before but this is the strongest. It's smart how they moved the dispenser opening to the top of the cartridge so each pull of the leash does not impact the spring system, instead it hits the plastic outer shell which gives the leash much better longevity. I have a 115 pound dog and this works great."
5,Flexi Small Retractable 23-Foot Classic Long,Good product. Don't understand why the small dog only gets 23 feet and all other sizes get 26. Was hoping for longer but good product none-the-less.
3,received wrong product so will review what I received,"I can't review the Flexi 3-8 leash since that is not what I received. The 3-8 is a 26' CORD leash. That is what I ordered. I recevied the Flexi 3, which is a tape leash. The tape leash is a nice leash, but they tend to not last as long as the cord leash. But since both of my other leashes had been chewed by my new Lab and I needed something right away, I had to use what I received. Nice leash, but I will not buy through this process again."
5,Excellent bully sticks for the price,"These are great, low-priced bully sticks. They do not last very long with my dog, but he enjoys them. They do not smell. Never had a problem with the order."
1,Too heavy! and too much tension.,"This thing is terrible. It is so heavy my arm hurts after holding it for 3 minutes. True I am no bodybuilder and honestly I could not do a pull up to save my life. But my friend has a retractable leash that I have to trouble with at all, it feels like this one weighs about 5 times more.Also, if you try to leave the strap loose so the dog can run around, it has too much tension on it. Meaning, it is constantly pulling on my dog's neck, meaning he is constantly turning around trying to bite it instead of walking. Ok yes he is a puppy and needs more training (starting obedience school this weekend) but he walks just fine on his regular plain leash.Basically when I tried to use this it was the worst walk we ever had. The plain leash is better, the cheapo retractable my friend has is better, I think a rope would be better.I really want to return it but I'm sure the postage will be about half the price of the stupid thing, because it is so heavy.VERY disappointing."
4,strong,"this solves the problem of large dogs on retractable leashes rather well. Its a bit heavy and the weight isnt balanced on the spool vs where you grip it, so it causes a little wrist fatigue. its also somewhat large. But thats not uncommon for these types of leashes. all in all, it is solidly build and does what its supposed to."
3,ok leash,"Price went up by $10 overnight. This Flexi leash does hold up to big dogs but would have liked to have a thick section of material like the rope ones have so the dog can't chew through leash so easily, otherwise a good leash."
2,Best of the Worst,"I use this lead for my two big dogs (90lbs and 80lbs). I really hate the tape lead, and I miss the wire lead that Flexi used to sell in the 26' length. While the wire could definitely give you a burn if you were not careful, the tape leads do not last. The first 26' Flexi classic 3 wire lead I bought lasted for almost three years before it would not retract anymore and I had to replace it. I have to buy a tape lead every few months. The tape does not do well in the snow and rain. Anyway, all the other brands I have tried have been worse, so I am stuck using Flexi until I find a better alternative."
4,Love it! Retracts great.,Had a similar leash before but it didn't retract well. This one is nice and long it retracts very fast and very smooth. The lock mechanism works great too. Our baby boy is 75 pounds and it holds him.
5,Best Leash Ever!,"I had a Flexi-Leash that was about 20 years old and it finally broke. I needed a replacement and bought some other brand. It was garbage. I bought a second leash that was some other brand. Again, garbage. I finally smartened up and bought a Flexi-Leash and the difference is night and day. I don't feel like the dog has control (as he often wants) and I don't feel like if he starts pulling too hard that he'll break the leash. I fully expect another 20 years out of the new Flexi-Leash, and even if it only lasts half that time, I'll still feel like I got more than my money's worth out of the product!"
5,Great leash,This leash is exactly what I ordered and I love dealing with Amazon. After a few months of using the leash it started to rip. I returned it to Amazon and they sent me a new one right away. You can't go wrong with buying this leash and Amazon it the best place to shop because of their service.
3,sleazy but ok,"This film is incredible. the plot is a joke - i looked at the ceiling several times, wondering what the hell were they thinking. It has the trademark fulci violence and - wait - it even has lucio fulci himself, machine gun in hand, killing some bad guys! now this is what i call class! it's hilarious: a guy in a horse race screams he won! he won!, then he looks back, with his mouth open and gets a gun barrel in the mouth and boom! a seller of cut cocaine gets her face blowtorched!... it's... well it's funny! the soundtrack is a treat, you keep humming it after the film ended... all the elements of sleaze are here but fans of fulci should seek this one out."
3,Crash Course on Blade Work,"This small pamphlet is a crash course to teach military personnel rapidly the salient points of bladecraft. This program of instruction is formatted in series of brief training sessions to allow an untrained knife combant to rapidly learn the required skill-set to safely wield a knife in-extremis combat situations. There are better knife fighting forms then what is presented in this book, but most require much more time and resources to lean. This well condensed manual is simple, concise and to the point (no pun intended) instruction. This manual is illustrated with numerous line drawings. The material in the manual is dated but I recommended it for the historical study of military combatives. For a more difinitve work on knife fighting see the authors other book ""The Complete Book Of Knife Fighting""."
2,Not Worth It,"This is a small, thin and very simple book on fighting offensively with a knife. I read it at one sitting and then talked to my son who was home for leave from the Marine Corps. They are taught to do just the OPPOSITE of what this book teaches and he convincingly demonstrated to me why. So it left a lot of doubts in my mind about the author's knowledge of the subject. There must be better manuals out there."
4,Santo Contra La Mafia Del Vicio,"When I bought the movie, I expected a lot of thrills. I was completely right. Since I discovered this explosive wrestler, he downrightly put Hulk Hogan to shame in many ways. This is coming from someone who grew up on Hulkamania. This foreign spy movie has a lot of Bond elements. It is one of main reasons that I love it. The 5'9 Hispanic wrestler seemed like over six feet tall with his strength, courage, and heart. Please check this movie out."
3,interesting but a little boring,"Mr. Asch is obviously a thorough and competent specialist of the period. It seems to me that he is writing essentially from a German perspective, which is not a bad thing, but his thorough expositions, chapter by chapter, lack the additional dimension one would expect to find in a book describing such an amazing period of European history. In other words, this is accurate, solid stuff but after a while, it takes some effort to labour through the rest of the book. Historians can't be expected to write page turners, but still !"
3,Took A Powder Half Way Through,"This could've been a lot better but there are holes in the storyline and the acting doesn't mesh. I think that the director dropped the ball. Also, ""Powder's"" makeup was too obviously powder. A pet peeve of mine is why does every person in a movie who happens to be different, have to be portrayed as a genius at something? Can't there be a genetic throwback/forward who is just a regular person?"
2,Not as great as I remembered...,"Seeing this movie for the first time was awe-inspiring. I thought I had to own it, but in actuality, the acting, writing, and screenplay isn't as great as I remember it being. This edition is super lame,too; lacks features and doesn't even have any previews. At least it's cheap..."
5,Powder,I read the cons of this movie and was pleasantly surprised to find that there were no gay overtones to this movie. I feel sorry for the poor fool who saw some in it. It was a brilliantly written and produced film with gifted actors to portray compasionate people. What is more science fiction that the fact that there is a compasionate side to humans.Sean Patrick Flannery did an outstanding job as Powder.I wonder how if felt to play that part. He did an excellant job.
1,Bad choice,"This disc was not formatted for my region.All the information about the disc was there, I just didn't understand it all.Not the sellers fault."
1,disappointed,"I guess I was susposed to know that the dvd I was ordering from the United States would only play in the UK. Took a long time to get the dvd and when I got it, it would not play in my dvd player. Came to find out that it was a code 2 (UK) and I needed a code 1 to play in the (US). They offered to take it back and would refund the cost of the dvd but not the shipping. Well, it cost more to ship it back than I paid for the dvd, plus the shipping I already paid for once already. Needless to say I have a dvd that I can't play."
1,Version of Movie was in French.,"I ordered this Movie to watch with my daughter and the recorded version in it's original format is American English. However, the version I received was recorded in French. Very Disappointed. The cover is in the English Langauge but the DVD again is a French Language Recorded version."
5,"Reflective, and a true picture about our society","This is not a happy movie, but it has its times, but the main thing on the movie is that it teaches u about the real meaning of truth and love, shows you that love is powerfull and it is highter than things such as outside beauty. I highly recommend this movie who wants to make your life better for yourself and to others around you."
5,Powder hits all the right notes!,"Yeah, we've seen it all before.This time it is a man that is pale white, other times it's a fat kid with stupid glasses. But what makes this film so touching is that you feel for this character from the begining. It's kinda like you see this really hot girl. You fall in love with her looks, but then, after meeting her, you come to realize you love her. That's what it is like in this wonderfully made movie about fears, all of us fear, happening to one unique person. Wonderful! Great entertainment for all ages, and should be seen by all ages."
5,A movie from and for the heart,"I watched this movie on a whim, prior to reading any reviews.I cried. And I laughed. And I cried while laughing. And in end had no doubts that everyone would fall in love with this movie.Then I read reviews, most snobbishly negative. I was stunned. Who *cares* about technicalities if the movie can MOVE you? And if you have a heart, it will.Buy it, put your critic's hat aside, and watch it from your heart. Feel it, involve yourself - don't wait to be entertained as if it were some shallow, action-adventure flick.For those of you who hated it, I'd ask that you watch the deer-kill scene over again. There's a lesson in there for you: open your heart."
5,Extraordinary,"An awesome and thought-provoking film. I loved it, and came away wanting to be better than I am, and was reminded to be better to others. I am drawn back to it over and over, and each time it touches my heart. I am only sorry I missed it at the theater. Take a break from the usual and treat yourself to a viewing of this movie. As for the bad reviews---well, not all will be touched by it. However, I think all will remember it. See it."
1,YUCK!,WHO ever even came up with idea it's just a stupid movie about a guy that gets hit by ligtning and I can't give you the details because im getting disgusted just writing about it!
3,my mistake,"Love the movie, shipped quickly and in new condition, but made the mistake of ordering region 2 instead of region 1. Ordered a replacement but now I'm stuck with a region 2 lying about"
1,POWDER,"I wanted the movie, becuase its such a great movie! HOWEVER- when i recieved the move, it was IN FRENCHand NOT IN ENGLISH!So, I returned it and got my money back minus the shippiong both ways!"
2,Pathetic schlock,"This movie was an ambitious, but well-meaning, failure that made me cringe. If you want to portray a persecuted outcast in the bad old cruel world, at least make the character likable. I gave it two stars because I agree with some of the earlier reviewers that mention the raw portrayal of the best and worst in humanity. However, the film's delivery was so preachy and heavy-handed it crushed any chance of making this film work."
3,"Uneven, but worth seeing","This is one of the more uneven films I've seen in the last few years. There are moments that are blindingly inappropriate and ones that are deeply touching. There is a lot of pain here, and a sense of reconciliation that is undeniable, and I think that's why it had such an appeal for younger viewers.The performances are uneven, too, though in some cases I think this has more to do with how the characters were written than with any lack of ability on the part of an excellent cast. Lance Henriksen has rarely gotten roles this good. He is allowed a range of emotion that is way beyond most of the stuff he's been doing in the last couple of years. I really think this is one of his best performances, and if he doesn't have tears running down your face at least once during the film, you're a no-hoper.Give it a try. You might find some real personal value in this story."
3,Chowder!,"The only reason I wrote this review is because I wanted to say ""Chowder!"" Three stars, movie was neither good nor bad."
5,A Spiritual Masterpiece,"In Jeff Shannon's Amazon editorial review, he claims ""Powder struggles to be all things to all viewers--equal parts E.T. and The Elephant Man--which compromises its overall impact....it's not a great movie..."".I saw E.T. and The Elephant Man and I could not stomach either of them twice, but I've watched Powder many times over the years and every time I see it I find myself choked up. In my 46 years, very few movies have come close to offering the depth of spiritual beauty found in this film.Jeff, your comments are an injustice to this beautiful, spiritual work of art. The only struggle I see is the one you are having in getting in touch with your own heart."
5,"One of the most beautiful films - ""technology surpasses humanity . . .""",This film was ahead of its time; now that technology is gaining speed - and passing humanity. . . this could very well be humans in the next 1000 years or less.
4,What was he?,"Powder was one of 3 things, an extraterrestrial/human hybrid, a human who finally evolved into pure energy or an angel."
1,Trite,"Trite, sappy, and predictable. You can see the plot coming a mile away. Hackneyed screenplay. Average acting at best. Don't bother"
1,Wanted to slap Powder across his face!,"I boy gets amazing powers. Does he use them for good? No he mopes around, complaining about how misunderstood he is! He needs a good kick in the pants! For a much better movie that covers a lot of the same ground check out John Travolta in Phenomenom."
1,"Great Message, But Bad Movie","I thought this movie was very boring, I could harldy sit through it. It was practically painful (but I at least wanted to finish). The plot is pretty stupid. The guy gets hit by lighting and he becomes different from everyone else. The story drags on and on and on until the end which also stunk. Over all the movie stunk but it did have a great message. The message is to not judge people on thier apperance and that nobody is, can, or ever will be normal.There, now after reading the message there is no point in watching the movie - lol. Go do something that you'll actually be glad you spent time doing. Just don't watch this movie or worse, buy it - lol"
1,Total Garbage,"This pile of steaming crap is one of those message movies that comes across as pretentious, self-righteous nonsense. There is a big difference between the quality of a movie and the message that it attempts to convey. Powder may be trying to convey a lofty message, but I assure you that the presentation is laughable and just plain stupid.The only people that could possibly take this dog excrement seriously are those individuals that like to sit around and brood that nobody understands them. A terrible, terrible, terrible movie."
1,This is a movie?,"Powder is movie about a teenager who power to do tricks and things like like that. This movie has no story what so ever. I rented this movie before I looked this up on Amazon.com, but I checked it up to write this review. Please don't waste your movie and go by something that you won't be dissapointed in."
1,Powder,"As a Christian, I find this movie to be a religious statement in the wrong direction. It has you by the heartstrings much of the time, but feeds you a Beatle's ""everything is one"" world view over and over. If your life goal is to ""explode"" into the universe and be absorbed by the impersonal energy around you, then Powder is the film for you. To the objective soul Powder fizzles!"
2,Doesn't measure up,"I used to own a Remmington electric nail file that bit the dust recently. This is what lead me to purchase this product. I am dissapointed in the fact that these things have NO POWER!! As far as the trimmer goes its not a problem... but for the nail file, the lack of speed and power makes it useless. I may as well use a regular nail file. Too bad Remmington stopped making the one I had before. It ran on a AA battery and had enough power. This one is too tiny, the file attachments are too easy to break, they are not corse enough to do any good, and the attachments don't have any sort of bag or something to keep you from losing them. Battery life of the AAA is not satisfactoy either. Overall, The only good point is their portability."
3,Okay,If you can stand to get through the first half...the last half is much better. Not Ferrell's best... Elf so far has been his best!!!There is good storyline with this. And the fact just having fun is more than actually winning!!!Rent don't buy!!!
3,Funny In A Way,"If you are looking for Will Farrell's best performance/funniest movie I don't recommend this one. Yes it is fun but in a very childish way. However, this is a decent family film. It reminded me of when I played little league soccer and how some dad's were just way to in it. Overall, I think everyone will find this movie quite funny but as for the story line it is very plain and simple and predictable."
1,Stupid from start to finish..Same old Will Ferell,When will people learn that Will Ferell is just bad at acting and almost all his movies are bad except Elf which was one of the funniest x-mas movies ever. The story is really stupid and predictable. The jokes are old and Will Ferell's humor is old. The movie is more of a kids film then for adults. This movie has been done lots in hollywood for example Little Giants which was way better. Overall bad really bad thank god I seen the movie for free one of the worse of the year.
1,Watcher beware!,"(I would have put 0 stars but the website would not allow it) I typically love Will Farrell but was highly disappointed in this movie. Of all the trailers I have seen, not one mentioned the gay/lesbian content in this movie. I watched it with my children and found myself cringing when Will Farrell's character said that the lesbian soccer parents were ""better"" than the other soccer parents on the team! This is not the kind of entertainment I want to bring into my home. It may be suitable for some families but I find the studio's neglect to inform us of this same-sex relationship is a sneaky way to get this product into the homes of conservative parents."
2,What's the point???,"About half of this movie was enjoyable, then it quickly went downhill. The first part was a family movie, and the second was like a Saturday Night Live skit. Robert Duval and Mike Ditka were wonderful as the neighbors from hell, and dad from Hell (Duval). There are a lot of lessons in this movie that you don't want your kids to learn, as well as some choice swearing by Ditka in the bonus feature section. Why?? Did they think the kids needed more vocabulary words? Thanks, but no thanks.I'm not a fan of Will Farrell, especially after wasting good money seeing Anchor Man at a movie theatre, but I wanted to like this movie. Too bad."
2,a few laughs but that's it...,"As parents who have coached soccer before and having a son currently on a team, we rented this one. Will Ferrell usually delivers. This movie had a few laughs in it but that's about it.To me a lot of it just seemed disjointed. The stuff with the coffee-obcession seemed a bit forced and out of place. We never got to know much about most of the kids."
1,What are you people talkin about?,"Oh my god why would you give this movie a five star rating? This movie was horrible. I mean Will Farrell use to be funny back a few years ago and it looks like he tries hard to be funny. Old School is probably one of his best movies but the new movies like Elf, Bewitched, and Kicking and Screaming are bad. This movie almost looks like a rip off of Little Giants. Don't waste your time. It's not a funny movie at all. The jokes are lameless. I walked out of the theater in this one."
2,Disappointing,"The preview must have contained every minute of decent footage from this movie. I usually love Will Ferrell, but this movie just wasn't that funny."
1,one of the worst movies i ever seen,I think Will Ferrell is not even funny at all i wish that he would hang it up. he just not funny at all the movie sucks if i was you i would not think of getting this movie i would pass. I got this movie and i thought that it would be a good movie and it was not it is as bad as Elf the movie just plain bad..
3,Average...,"I normally would not have rented this but my wife loves Will. It turned out to be quite funny, and the storyline was good as well. Ditka and Duval both doing above job in terms of acting and Will is Will. Some bad acting parts by Will (when he cries in the car) but overall good movie. Good fun for the family."
3,SOCCER TO ME,"Will Ferrell can be fitfully funny at times; and at other times, he can be fitfully annoying. He has moments of both in this entertaining if derivative kiddie flick. Ferrell plays the not so jockish son of jock Robert Duvall, who finds himself drafted to coach his son's really bad soccer team. Ferrell finds himself getting addicted to caffeine and lucks into two good players in Italian children who help their uncle in his butcher shop. Former Chicago Bear Mike Ditka generates a few laughs playing himself, and the kids are appropriately cute. It's all predictable and harmless fun the family can watch together."
3,Okay.......but not Ferrell's best,"This is an okay movie, but it in no way compares to the great performances by Will Ferrell in movies like Old School and Elf. This movie centers around Ferrell's ongoing competition with his dad which is mirrored to a lesser extent between their sons. They face off as soccer coaches and there are some predictable funny results. Many scenes I found disturbing and just sad instead of funny. This is an okay movie, just not what we've come to expect from funny man Will Ferrell."
3,meh,"There were amusing parts, but for the most part I wouldn't cal this a great movie... I would recommend it mainly to people who love Will Ferrell"
3,Kicking & Screamin,"I bought this for for actors who were in it. OK script, a bit refreshing, a little different from the usual kids comedy."
2,Pretty bad,"Really, the only reason I gave this film two stars is because Mike Ditka was pretty funny. The movie was pretty lame and not funny otherwise."
3,Funny/Crazy,"My children of course loved it, however, i thought it was slap-stick funny only. But Will Ferrill is always fun to watch."
4,Hilarious and bring the whole family.,"I was originally worried that this movie would be a little ""corny"" for its PG rating. But, boy was I wrong! This film was funny from start to finish. Will Ferrell is equally talented at family humor and R-rated humor. For an actor to make me laugh that much at both is very acceptable in my book.But the real treasure of this film lies with Mike Ditka. Do not underestimate him! He is the funniest thing of the movie. Its like he's playing himself in real life by seeing the way he coaches the kids. I must say there is just something funny about guys yelling at kids. Great comedy for the start of the summer movie season!"
3,I may be tired of Will Ferrell's typical schtick,"Most of Will Ferrell's movies cause me to laugh. In fact, I usually double-over in pain that is not too dissimilar to that of a runner. I simply can't breathe during portions of the movie. Kicking and Screaming didn't have that affect, however.Even the addition of Mike Ditka, the historical coach of the Chicago Bears - my favorite team - couldn't really save this retread. The coffee bit was boring, the soccer angle was contrived, the addition of the superstar players has been done a million times before, and we all know that the kid who is forgotten about is going to pull through in the end.It's cute, and probably works for the kids, but it's a lot like watching an actual soccer match. There may be one or two goals, and one or two excited moments, but for the most part it's grown men throwing fits and rolling around on the ground in poorly acted agony. It's good for a light laugh, but not much more."
2,Kicking and Screaming...the whole movie!,"Unless you think it's funny to watch a grown man scream at little children for an entire movie, I wouldn't recommend this!"
5,WORKS WELL AND QUICK!!!!,Until recently the various supplements we've tried for my husband only brought minimal improvement. On March 14th we started a subscription to this based on customer reviews here. I was impressed with the reviews by people who drink a lot of alcohol and love this to keep their liver in line. We do not drink due to our medical issues so I knew if it worked WELL for them it should work for my husband (we have had a hard time with his elevated liver functions). We just got his first bloodwork results of 2012 and his liver function has improved by HALF!!!!!! Mind you we just purchased this for the first time in March and the bloodwork was done June 8th!
1,Himalaya dose,"Been taking 2 of these pills a day for 3 months. My ALT went UP 20 points, to 198 u/l and my AST went UP 4 points, to 122 u/l. VERY disappointing. Next 3 months I'm going to double the dosage and see what happens. Will review again in 3 months. Am PRAYING for improvements like everyone else seems to be getting.Well, several months have passed since my last comments and what I was hoping for never came to pass. Nothing that I've tried so far has made in significant difference in my liver count. When your liver is running almost 5 times above the normal count, it would take something pretty miraculous to bring the numbers back into a semi-normal range. Never had a chance to see what the milk thistle could do. I was one of the unfortunates that had the ferocious bowel reaction. So bad that it sent me to the hospital. So, until someone comes up with something else, I will continue the count down."
4,Good,"I have a liver problem so I have been taking these for a month or so can't say for sure that they are working but I only have to take 1 a day which is a plus, It's an herbal product,"
2,Sugar in LiverCare?!?!,"I am a fan of Himalaya Products and I picked this up at a local health food store because I am starting a detox diet for my health. I was so let down when I took my first dosage to find out that yes, indeed, it has SUGAR!!! It is not necessary to add sugar to this supplement, but it is too late for me. I will have to pour the bottle out and look for another detox method. Not happy, but I will not take sugar in a supplement for any reason."
2,My Doctor said to stop wasting my money,"My physician's advice, after reading the ingredient label, was this is a bunch of crap and to stop wasting my money on it.So, I did and I don't feel any different as a result."
5,Himalaya Herbal Healthcare.,Anybody who has bile ducts narrower just by how you were born with. Anybody who has bloating from an occasional drink or food that is heavier in ingredients. Apparently those herbs do boost enzyme production in one's liver.
4,Liver care,I like this product. Seems that my energy level is up and I just feel better. Would recommend this product to anyoneone.
5,great for health,this stuff is the best thing you can take to stay healthy.your liver has over 500 functions it performs so if it isnt healthy you dont feel your best. great product with testing to back it up.
5,This stuff works!,"I've been taking this for more than 5 years and it works very well for me. When I get bloodwork done for my annual physical, my liver enzymes are in the optimum range. Before I started taking LiverCare (Liv52), my liver enzymes were very high. This supplement really works well."
5,good product,"arrived quickly started feeling better about 4 days after initial dose, looks to be a legit product, when labs come back that will be the tell all."
1,Not what i expected,The real liver care has totally different ingredients. Some of the ingred in this product are toxic to your body. So def not something i will b ordering again
1,Don't buy from this company,"I will never deal with these idiots again. No service,no answers no product."
4,Organic nuts,"They don't have a lot of flavor, as I was used to regular cashews. But, they are good and definitely more healthy than regular ones. I will buy them again."
3,Klein's Naturals Cashews,"I was pleased with delivery timeframe. However, the Klein's Naturals Cashews were not fresh. They were a bit and dry and unflavorful because the cellophane that covered the top of the nuts was loose. This caused air to enter the nuts causing them to dry out in shipping. I am displeased with the packaging of the nuts."
2,"Not great, not fresh","I have been looking for a source of raw cashews as the ones I can get in my area are really, really expensive. I thought I would give these a try. Ordered them in August, they arrived quickly, but each or the 6 containers says ""Sell by 07/06/11"", so they are out of date. Still, sell by is not the same as use by, and all of that dating business is not required or regulated and doesn't mean that much. So I tried them. The first container was pretty tasty and the cashews were HUGE. Then a couple of the others had issues with the plastic ""seal"" underneath the snap-on lid. So I won't be buying these again, since the ones I could use ended up being as expensive as the ones I can get at the local store. It is a shame, as the nuts are very tasty when they go into the package. They just don't stay that way, and you may get tnuts that are past the sell-by date to begin with."
2,broken seals,"Two out of the six nut packages had broken plastic seals. I am not sure if they were tampered with or if the seal was flimsy and broke. Either way, I will be discarding one third of the product. I do not recommend."
3,"Klein's Naturals Cashews, Open Packs","I purchased these nuts and when I received them, two containers were open. Amazon replaced the shipment extremely fast at no cost to me, thank you Amazon. I received the second shipment and had three containers open. So out of twelve containers I did get seven good ones which contained very delicious cashew nuts. Klein's Naturals have a good product but defiantly needs a major change in there packaging system. The nuts get five stars but the packaging gets less than one star, so I will settle on three stars.Squirrels did chow down on the five bad containers of nuts with no complaints and gave them five stars."
3,Terrible Packaging,"I just received these nuts and although there is nothing wrong with the quality of the nuts, the packaging is terrible. They come in a set of 6 plastic containers and 4 out of the six packages arrived unsealed and opened. The nuts were loose all over the inside of the box."
4,Good vitamins but HUGE,I've taken Solgar vitamins before but wanted ones designed especially for women so I got these. I can't feel a difference but know I need supplements and am happy with these aside from the fact that they are huge vitamin pills and the recommended dose is 3 of the huge pills. Just something to keep in mind if you don't like the smell of vitamins and consider the size and quantity necessary to get the benefits of the supplement.
3,Do not understand the smell,"Noticed a funny smell in the house that I could not identify. I cleaned, vacuumed, laundered, and searched, and could not find the source. . .then I remembered someone mentioning the smell in a review. Vitamins, stink up my house? No way.Yes way.I organized them in a pill organizer and every time I opened the door to where they were stored, they they were. I finally decided to store them in the refrigerator as I live in Florida, and that helped some. However, I'm sitting next to them now, and they still emit.I like the quality of the vitamins, I do feel they make a difference in my energy levels and well being. . .I'm just trying to decide if I can live with the odor :/Decisions."
3,These are horse pills!,"I know that these are some of the best vitamins on the market, but they are absolutely HUGE and difficult to swallow - plus you have to take 3 of them at once for one serving. I feel a lump in my throat for an hour afterwards. I'm hoping that my quality of life will so significantly improve that I will just appreciate them but I probably won't buy them again."
1,A History of Northeast Missouri,"The book contains good information. It is a collection of Northeast Missouri County histories. The printing and paging of the book, however, is quite a mess. The chapters don't line up, some of the printing is garbled, and the attempt to breakdown the book into ""sections"" leaves much to be desired. I ended up creating my own file card Table of Contents by County to help me navigate the pages.....plus the use of yellow stickies. End result 4 stars for content, 0 for format. Best bet is the library."
5,Necessary for any lover of Prydain,Wish this had been on our bookshelves when I was a kid and devouring these books! I especially like Dalben as a child...
4,An Excellent Supplement to Horatio Hornblower Series,"""The Real Hornblower"" is a surprisingly in-depth book following and examining the life of Admiral Sir James Gordon. Perrett has obviously researched Gordon under a microscope, as there is very few sections of his life that are not covered. The book begins with a short examination of C. S. Forester, and his creation of Horatio Hornblower, and then delves into Gordon's life, through newpaper articals, personal letters, ship logs, and Gordon's own unpublished auto-biography. In addition to following Gordon, Perrett gives a very acurate historical account of the wars and politics (which revolve around the European and American naval fleets) during the time that Gordon was alive, make this an excellent naval history or reference book as well. For anyone who has read C. S. Forester's series on Horatio Hornblower, this book is an excellent supplement, allowing you to see a different side of 'Hornblower' in Admiral Sir James Gordon."
5,Nat'l Air & Space Museum review,Great photograghs with well written copy. This book makes me want to go to this museum and see first hand the items displayed. Highly recommend!!!
1,EDA world,"Very basic overview of the EDA world, less thorough than any ""EDA for Dummies""...The book does not worth the money if you are already in that business."
3,"good resource, but all the experiments are not successful","I have been using this book to teach a science class in a co-op this year. Many of the experiments are interesting and simple, but I had trouble getting several of the experiments to work. I definitely think you could find some useful experiments, but make sure you try them before they are presented, or you could be disappointed. Just a little hint- youtube has some wonderful science videos with amazing experiments to do, and it's free if you have the internet!"
5,Last monopod you'll buy,"I bought this monopod from Bogen-Manfrotto because of my experience with my tripod, Bogen-Manfrotto 3021BPRO Tripod coupled with 701RC2 head. I knew this monopod would be solid and quality build...and I was right. I looked at others, but they were just flimsy.This uses the same RC2 rapid connect plate as my tripod so I can easily change my camera/camcorder between the tripod and monopod.If you want something that will last you long time, you can't go wrong with Bogen-Manfrotto brands."
3,Men's choir in action.,A men's choir padding the whole score. Yuk! I just like instruments.Otherwise four star.
3,"A good soundtrack, but can't listen to it too much","Crimson Tide is a soundtrack that sounds very much like typical Hans Zimmer. It is not difficult to see that the Lion King, The Rock, and the Peacemaker were scored by the same man.The music builds and builds and builds to wonderful and powerful dramatic crescendoes, but the building process sometimes seems a bit overmuch. I find myself often wanting to get past the 8 minutes of tension music to hear the few precious seconds of resounding orchestration that is almost worth waiting for. Perhaps if the nearly 70 minute soundtrack was broken up into more tracks?"
3,"Pleasant enough, but not great or original","Like many Hans Zimmer soundtracks, this one is all Zimmer. It has that Zimmer feel, and as such it is interchangeable with the rest. Heard Gladiator? Well, you've heard this too, at least in part. And the other part? Well, the best parts of this score, in my opinion, are those that seem to borrow very very heavily from the hymn ""For Those in Peril on th Sea"" which is the hymn of the US Naval Academy and often played at sailors memorial services.So. Lacking in originality in so many ways, but well executed and pleasant to listen to. But not the best way to spend your money."
3,Crimson Tide soundtrack,"The soundtrack is very repetitive. Having not seen the film I can't say why. The music is very evocative of the sea, and battle, and is very stirring. I bought the CD for one particular track, which is very short unfortunately."
3,"Great Soundtrack, terrible arrangement.","Just from having seen the movie I knew this was one of my favorite all-time soundtracks. It's too bad the arrangement of the tracks is so terrible. There is little or no order to the pieces and as has been pointed out already, some tracks are too long and contain too much mood music. Three stars."
3,Pretty darned good,"If you liked the film, this is an excellent choice for you. Zimmer is one of the greatest at setting a mood and heightening tension, and this CD certainly does that. You may not sit down and just listen to the whole thing straight through, but use it for background while you work, read, or drive, and you will truly appreciate it. Especially notable is Zimmer's arrangement of the beautiful Navy Hymn, used several times on this disc. The only drawback is the length of the tracks, but when you're passing everything on the freeway, you won't even notice."
3,"Great, but not original music","How to do it Yourself: take 1 piece of the great ""Hunt for the Red October"" Soundtrack, then add generously some deep sea-cold war-post atomic atmosphere, then mix with one pound Marianne Faithful's - in deep black nothing sinking feelings, wagnerise powerful all the resulted stuff, dress with russian choral cream, mix again and ... do not forget to press down the whole stuff till it becomes boring. I tried 5 times to listen to this album, every time my eyes closed before the fifth track. 3 stars for the first and the third track. The second are 100 % useless."
3,house with laughing windows,"I swear and will always stand by it that when I was in Italy, i saw the actual house. The house and the area around it looked so much like in the film, it had to be, like wow.this film was ok. It was all about re-painting this picture in a church that may have been based on real life murders. It was a little slow at times but i did enjoy it. I got a little confused here and there but i'd watch the film again."
4,a great album!,"I've finally found an enjoyable album of Spanish music after going through several awful so-called flamenco, gypsy, and Latin collections. This is a great album; loved the piano playing. However, I wish the guitar was more upfront, if I'd wanted a piano album I would buy one. Also, why only 8 songs at 45mins?Perhaps they do sound better live. I hope Spain live is released."
5,Spectacular inspiration,"Polymer clay artists who enjoy antique and ancient jewelry will love this book. The art and artifacts are beautifully reproduced. The jewelry fashioned from polymer clay closely resemble the museum examples but with a unique contemporary flair. Directions are clear, concise, and well illustrated. The techniques are easily adapted to your own creations. And once you've tried them, you will want to do more."
4,Not as bad as some reviewers feel,"While this will never replace the manufacturer's manual, it also is surely a bargain compared to it, too. Good basic information and a good starting point for anyone who needs a little guidance."
1,911 Haynes Manual,"A 24 model year span can't do justice to any particular model. Porsche details changed constantly, sometimes in mid-production year. The manual leaves you clueless, particularly if you are looking for info on a 84-89 911 3.2."
3,Experience needed,"This book is pretty good for older 911s (up to 1977). It requires the reader to have significant prior experience working on 911s. As a general rule, if you're capable of rebuilding engines and are comfortable turning wrenches on 911s, then this book will work for you. A novice will find this book inadequate."
3,Good basic manual,This book covers the basics but is no substitute for the factory manuals. A better book would be the Bentley manual. If you need additional information on maintenance of these older Porsche 911's you should check out [...] and [...] for additional information and advice/help.Overall I would recommend having this book in your library as it does a decent job at covering the topics it includes.
2,A disappointment for a Haynes Manual,"Best if you own an early 911. If you have a SC or carrera, this will be less than useful. You are better off getting the Bentley Manual."
2,Mostly useless - buy the factory manuals instead,"Anyone who thinks they'll be able to completely rebuild a Porsche 911 using this book (as the cover claims) is living in a world of make-believe. As the other reviewers have pointed out, the book glosses over any 911 made after 1977, and doesn't give any instruction on activities that the home mechanic might want to do, such as removing the airbox or changing the sparkplugs or filters. If you're serious about working on your 911, pony up the cash and buy the factory manuals. They're expensive, but worth the price you pay for them, especially if you factor in the money you're saving on labor costs. The Haynes manual is seriously out-of-date and useful only as an occasional reference."
1,Disappointing,I had always used Haynes Manuals to teach myself basice vehicle maintenance. This manual is an exception to their usual high quality.
2,Barely useful,"This book I consider barely useful. It's probably handy to those who already are familiar with the car and just need a reference, but if you're like me and have never worked on a 911 before, this book leaves out too many details that I would need to get the job done."
2,Good for early 911's only,"This is a great manual for 1965 through 1977 911's. The 1978 through 1989 (the SC and Carrera model) cars are given one chapter at the end, so apparently they wrote the book in 1978 and then just tried to update it with the later models.I guess it's true that you can't judge a book by it's cover!"
1,OVERPRICED at $1,Nothing of value in this book. You cannot sucessfully complete most of the tasks presented in this book with the information given. Buy the factory manuals or one of the other 911 books. Photos are very incomplete and poor quality.
4,a fun read,"This book is pure mind candy, but I enjoyed it. It's a pleasant romance, with a good dash of drama. I liked most of the characters, and the writing was enjoyable.It isn't great literature, but if you're looking for an enjoyable lesbian romance, you'll probably like this one."
2,letdown,OK I know I am a sucker for a romantic story & I loved Braund's first 2 books but this was such a letdown. The romance is cursory & not really satisfying & she even ruins one of the romantic storylines from a previous book. Lets hope the next book sees her return to form.
1,If you can't make it on your own use a famous name.,"An excellent example of the kind of crime reporting which became the (sub) standard with the advent of 24/7 News. No substance- all got cha' & grab title and a disregard for accuracy or audience intelligence. The Ripper; Bonnie & Clyde; Mike Tyson and Sophia Loren, the only thing these four have in common are the last two are famous persons and the first two are famous crimes. Ground beef with lots of filler."
2,Poor choice on my part,"very little value, should not have bought it. Little interest not much back ground of the subject matter and story's"
1,Meh,I only made it through the first hour of this before I actually just threw it away. I watched it the same day I received it. The show was very unorganized and was trying to do too much without any real reporting or consistency in information... not recommended at all...
3,Fabs video scrapbook,"FUN WITH THE FAB FOUR is another of the many Beatles ""documentaries"" that consist of press conference excerpts, interview clips, an overabundance of screeching Beatlemaniacs and the occasional TV broadcast dub. Televison samples include their Midsummer's Night Dream sketch.The primary drawback of this GOODTIMES VHS is a slow running speed, which makes already degraded source material that much the blurrier. For a low-priced peek however, you'll find it most adequate. If absolutely necessary to your Beatles archive, this hour-length melange is available on equally-inexpensive DVDs."
5,"must read for liberals, actually for everyone","do you...wonder what's going on in the 2008-09 financial crisis? wonder how we got where we are today? wonder what specifically needs to be done to make things better in the future? wonder what really happened in the great depression?if yes, read this book.it clearly and concisely lays out the answers."
5,Wilton Fanci Fountain,I used the Wilton Fanci Fountain for my daughter's wedding cake and it made the cake table absolutely beautiful! It was the most photographed cake ever! I received a lot of compliments on the cake and fountain. The fountain was easy to assemble and worked so well and made the cake look really classy.
3,Wilton Fanci Fountain,"Product as described by the seller, although it came in the original box and no evidence wilton brand. This makes me think that it is not wilton brand but a brand in China."
1,poor,"These product was brought to me from US,i opened the pack plug it,it was not working i was so disappointed with these product."
1,False Hope,"Cheap product, not worth a dime! Poorly set up and much smaller than the picture! Do not buy this product. It was highway robbery!"
4,Verry Nice!,Cant wait to use this along with my cakes. This will make my wedding cakes really elegant. The product is very light weight and not hevy. It also comes apart and its easy storage.
5,Wilton Fance Fountain,"Excelent product for decoration of cakes for weddings, birthdays, etc. This Type of products is the best for the work I have."
4,Cool charger,Charger does it's job. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it doesn't charge simultaneously. So if you are aware of these limitations then this is a good buy.
3,Content Great; Format questionable,"Brimming with jingoistic Americana these stories are a treat. I remember having a copy of one issue as a young boy- Rhode Island Red and that's why I purchased. Fun to read but... the spine of the paperback split and the last third of the pages fell out in a block...I only bought it to read so for me no great deal- a collector may be less sanguine...""caveat emptor"" or better ""caveat collector"""
2,Original marvel hc poor quality,"This hardcover was released by marvel along with a Boys Ranch collection. The BR hc has good quality reproductions and color but the FA hc is poorly reproduced with lots of ""fixed lines"". So, don't buy it.Buy the new one from the simon kirby library which is reproduced from the comic and doesn't have any restored portions."
